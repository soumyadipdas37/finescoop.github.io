Geri Horner has reportedly trademarked the name Rainbow Women as she prepares to release a children's book series.

The Spice Girl, 48, is said to have decided to focus on the new series which will celebrate LGBTQ+ people while she takes a step back from her music career, according to a report from The Sun on Friday.

A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Rainbow Woman will build on the Spice Girls' "girl power" ­legacy but will also celebrate ­diversity and LGBTQ people, which she has long been a supporter of.

'Geri is all about love and ­acceptance so it's important for that to be at the ­centre of everything she does.

'She recently filed legal ­documents to protect the name Rainbow Woman and has been hard at work on the project.'

The source added Geri hopes to release the first book in the series in time for the festive season, and added that even during lockdown she's managed to write a lot of the series. 

MailOnline has contacted Geri's representatives for comment.

Despite the possibility of Geri focusing more on her literary pursuits, her writing comes amid reports she could reunite with her Spice Girls bandmates for another tour next year to celebrate the girl group's 25th Anniversary.

Talking to Zoe Ball on her Radio 2 Breakfast Show recently, Geri's bandmate Mel C was grilled about the rumours of another reunion with bandmates Mel B, and Emma Bunton in 2021.

Fifth member Victoria Beckham turned down the 2019 tour as she wanted to focus on her family and fashion company.

Addressing the speculation, Mel admitted that the Spice Girls have been 'constantly talking' about a big world tour next year.

She said: 'Ooh, do you know what, I wish, I wish. I think we all do, like all artists including myself with my solo stuff, we're just having to wait and see what happens. 

'You know, the Spice shows are so huge and so many tours have been moved to next year. We're talking about it constantly so as soon as we have any news on that front I will let you know.'

In April, Mel C again hinted she would love to see the group head back on the road, following the huge success of their UK reunion tour last year.

Only recently, Emma revealed that all five of the Spice Girls reunited for a socially-distanced walk in the woods.

Speaking on her Sunday evening Heart FM radio show, Emma told listeners that herself, Mel B and Victoria were joined by Mel C and Geri Horner for a hike.

Referring to the COVID-19 lockdown, Baby Spice said: 'As things slowly, slowly start to get back to normal and we've all started to meet up with friends again haven't we? 

'Which is strange… I actually started to think I would never see them again… well unless it was on Zoom calls. And this week, yes, I finally got to meet up with Geri, Mel B, Mel C and Victoria!

'Now you may think we propped up a bar somewhere or had drinks in the garden but no! We went on a social distancing walk in the woods, yes!'
