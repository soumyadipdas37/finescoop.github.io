A woman arriving back from holiday in Turkey rushed to disembark from the plane - and went for a walk on the wing.

The mother-of-two was said to be 'too hot' after landing in Kyiv on a flight from Antalya.

She opened an emergency exit on the Boeing 737-86N and climbed onto the wing 'to get some air'.

Videos show stalling on the wing before climbing back inside the cabin.

She has now been banned from flying with Ukraine International Airlines.

Another returning holidaymaker said: 'The aircraft landed and almost all the passengers got off.

'She walked almost all the way from the tail to the emergency exit row, opened the door and went out.

'By that time her two children were outside the plane, and standing right next to me...

'They were surprised, saying: 'This is our mum'.'
