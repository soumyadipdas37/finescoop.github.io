Kulture's account is already brimming with cute mother daughter content, which includes a video of the pair in coordinating pink outfits. 

'Me & my mommy .....My mom was annoying me but it’s ok cause I look cute,' the performer cheekily captioned some footage of them walking in a parking lot, from her daughter's perspective.   

Cardi also shared a video of tot watching herself in an Instagram video, so she can listen to Sharif Rafael's track, Dreamgirl (Jungla Version) playing in the background. 

'On my Instagram making sure my mommy don’t post nothing embarrassing on my page,' the rapper captioned the recording of Kulture. 'OMG! I just love this song.'

New chapter: The new Instagram account comes days after she filed for divorce from her husband-of-three-years, Offset

The new Instagram account comes days after the performer filed for divorce from her husband-of-three-years, Offset.  

Although Offset, 28, who is the father of Cardi's has two-year-old, reportedly cheated in the past, Cardi insisted this split was not caused by him being unfaithful. 

Speaking in an Instagram Live video, she said: 'I want to say thank you so much. However, like, I don't really need it. I'm okay. I want to let you know I have not shed not one tear.'

She continued: 'This time, I wasn't crying. Wanna know why? The reason my divorce is not because of none of that s*** that ever happened before. It's not because the cheating. I'm seeing people [saying] "Oh, he has a baby on the way." That's a whole f*** complete lie.'

The marriage breakdown came after Offset and Cardi briefly split in 2018, before confirming speculation they had rekindled their romance when they attended the 2019 Grammy Awards together.

At the time, the I Like It rapper accused the Migos star of being unfaithful, but they were said to be trying to work things out for the sake of their daughter. 

'She wants them both to have custody and to co-parent,' a source told Page Six, this week. 'She's not requesting spousal support or child support. She wants everything to be super amicable.
