Tickets To My Downfall drops at midnight and in a recent interview with Howard Stern, Kelly stated that with this album he wanted 'to go against what everyone else thinks.'

'I make a pop-punk record … and everyone's like, "You switched genres!" To me, I just added on to the multiple things I've already done anyway, but, sure, what a narrow-minded way to look at things,' he explained.

During the remote interview, Machine Gun Kelly also made sure to open up about his passionate romance with Fox. 

'I didn't know what [love] was until me and her made eye contact... That's when I was like, 'Whoa!'' the hitmaker revealed.

The Houston native added: 'That was my first experience with being open to love and stuff like that. I definitely wasn't set up to believe that that's something that could ever exist.' 

MGK and Fox went public with their romance in May after meeting on the set of the movie Midnight In The Switchgrass.  

Filming on the production was taking place in Puerto Rico when it was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kelly told Stern that it had been 'love at first sight' when they met.

Megan and Kelly's romance emerged shortly after her split from husband of 10-years Brian Austin Green, 47.

The estranged couple share three sons, Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four.

Back in May, Green confirmed his split from Fox during an episode of his podcast ...With Brian Austin Green. During his confession, he maintained that infidelity did not play a role in their separation and that he will alway have love for Megan.

'I will always love her. And I know she will always love me and I know as far as a family what we have built is really cool and really special.'
