Coronation Street star Kate Ford is asking fans for £26.56 in return for a personalised video message and wishes people happy birthday and congratulations on job offers. 

The actress, 43, who plays Tracey Barlow, has joined the celebrity shout-out app Cameo, despite her co-star Sally-Ann Matthews condemning actors charging fans for messages. 

Kate, who also charges £9.12 for a chat, has received four five-star reviews for her short video clips in which she thanks fans for supporting Coronation Street.

In her bio, she has penned: 'Hi there it’s Kate ford aka Tracey Barlow !! Looking forward to all your message requests!'

And her profile also reveals that Kate typically replies to requests in three hours.  

Kate has shared four video clips to her Cameo page and tells one fan that she 'hopes' they will 'enjoy the storylines that are coming up' as the cast return to the set following the easing of coronavirus restrictions.

Hello: Kate wishes a fan a happy birthday and 'hopes' they will 'enjoy the storylines that are coming up'

In another video Kate congratulates a Tracey Barlow fan on receiving a job offer and described how she is 'thrilled' they are a big fan of the show. 

And Kate has received glowing reviews on her Cameo page with one fan describing how the footage 'made my wife's day' with another penning 'awesome'. 

A representative for Kate told MailOnline: 'Like many other actors who work in the television or film industry, Kate is on Cameo.' 

The mother-of-one has joined co-stars Antony Cotton, better known as Sean Tully in the soap, on the platform who charges £33.20 for a message. 

In her bio, she has penned: 'Hi there it’s Kate ford aka Tracey Barlow !! Looking forward to all your message requests!'

Katie McGlynn, who starred as Sinead Tinker, charges £100.43 per request in order to 'raise vital funds for Mummy’s Star, a UK-based charity for who provide support for women & families who are dealing with cancer in/around pregnancy.' 

It comes as Sally-Ann Matthews, 49, who plays Jenny Bradley in Coronation Street, spoke out against actors who charge fans for video messages last month. 

In response to a follower, she penned: 'Write to us at Trafford Wharf Road. We do them for free! You should never pay for an autograph (or a video message come to that) x.' 





Spat: The Jenny Bradley actress, 49, told a fan on social media in August that they should never pay for an autograph or a video from soap stars

Fan Suzanne Coleman responded: 'Exactly how it should be. Making cash from birthday messages is another issue for me. Don't get me started!'

Sally then replied: 'Oh I hear ya.' 

However her co-star Simon Gregson, who plays Steve McDonald, regularly sells personalised messages for £30, on another celebrity shout-out platform.

And Simon's wife Emma Gleave took the comments made by Sally-Ann as a dig at her husband. 

The mother of three said: 'Wow!!!! Nothing like sticking together with your work colleagues!' 

She also wrote in other tweets which have now been deleted according to The Sun: 'Grow a set of balls and tell ur cast members ur opinion.'

A number of the other Corrie stars also sell the videos to fans, including Ken Barlow actor William Roache and Chris Gascoyne who plays Peter Barlow.
