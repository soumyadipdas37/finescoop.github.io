A female 'poo jogger' left a disgusting surprise in a family's driveway while on an early morning run.

Fiona Mays, from Leederville in Perth, said the jogger defecated next to her home on Friday morning before her family had left to go to work.  

Ms Mays shared graphic details of the 'urgent poo' on social media and described how she was forced to clean up the vile mess. 

'So this morning there was a lady jogger around 8am who decided to leave us a nice Friday present,' Ms Mays captioned a photo of the mess. 

A female poo jogger left a vile 'urgent poo' (pictured above) in the driveway of a family home on a busy street in Leederville, north Perth, at about 8am on Friday morning

Fiona Mays shared a picture and details of the disgusting mess to social media (pictured) and said her family assumed the jogger had wandered into their driveway to use the bin

Ms Mays said the family assumed the jogger had wandered into the driveway to use the bin outside their Oxford Street home. 

'She came down our driveway and we thought nothing of it and maybe she was putting something in our bin...

'Until we left for work and saw she had left us a big sloppy s**t... f*****g disgusting,' Ms Mays explained.  

She said the woman was aged in her 40s or 50s and wearing jogging gear.   

'Not sure if she is known around the area or has done it anywhere else.    

'She was mooching around our drive and then must of done it,' Ms Mays wrote. 

Ms Mays said she was 'surprised no one saw her at that time of the morning' and the family lived in a busy area.    

'The reason I put it up is I know there has been a few serial pooers and was wondered if anyone else knew of her. 

'I think it's disgusting that someone feels the need to go on private property and leave that for someone else to clean. 

'In my opinion s**t your pants and clean your own mess!'

Leederville residents labelled the act as 'totally disgusting' and said there was 'no excuse for it'.    

'What is wrong with people?' one commenter asked.

'As if a person did this on someone's property,' another user wrote.   

'What the actual f*ck. Is this something you should report to the police?'    

The strange incident is not an isolated one in Australia, with similar cases also unfolding in Sydney and Brisbane.

Last year, Sydney PR queen Roxy Jacenko had her office blighted by an unknown woman who later came to be known as the 'Paddington Pooper'.

High-flying business executive Andrew Douglas Macintosh became Australia’s original ‘poo-jogger’ in 2018, after being photographed with his pants down in a Brisbane park. 

Ms Mays said she discovered the disgusting poo when she left her home on Oxford Street (pictured above) to go to work and was forced to clean it up
