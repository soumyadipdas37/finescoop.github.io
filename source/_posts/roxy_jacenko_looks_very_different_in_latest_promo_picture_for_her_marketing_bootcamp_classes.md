She's the PR dynamo who runs her successful Sweaty Betty Empire.

But on Wednesday, Roxy Jacenko looked unrecognisable in a new promotional photo for her online marketing classes. 

 

The 40-year-old shared a photo to Instagram, flaunting a noticeably smoother visage and a plumper looking pout.

Alongside the image, Roxy promoted her new online course, Marketing Bootcamp, which is an 'insiders guide' to everything PR.  

'Eeeeekkk - my NEW course is now complete!!!' she captioned the post. 

'The Marketing Bootcamp is the insider's guide to branding, marketing, PR and social media – Roxy style!'

Roxy has made no secret of her cosmetic enhancements in the past, which include a nose job and breast enlargement and non-surgical procedures like Botox and filler. 

Last year, Daily Mail Australia obtained several pictures from before her surgery overhaul.

The Sweaty Betty PR founder previously had dark hair and, in one snap, looks fresh-faced as she posed for a professional headshot. 

The professional headshot dates back to the early 2000s and shows Roxy with long dark locks posing in a white singlet.

Back in June 2015, Roxy told Who magazine about her rhinoplasty: 'I was over the droopy end and bump on the top of my nose, so it made sense to get it tweaked.

'My nose is already looking one hundred times better and being able to breathe [properly] is a luxury.'

She also had a boob job at the age of 24 - the same year she launched her now-successful public relations business Sweaty Betty PR. 

Roxy has also told Daily Mail Australia that she had her lips enlarged in 2017 - and still gets them done.

'Yes, I still have my lips done. But I've just learnt less is more!' Roxy said at the time.
