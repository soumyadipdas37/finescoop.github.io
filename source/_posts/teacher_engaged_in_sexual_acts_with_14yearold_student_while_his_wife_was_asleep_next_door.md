A New Zealand teacher has been found guilty of having sex with an underage student on multiple occasions.

Daniel Bruce McMillan started a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl while  teaching at Kingslea School for youth offenders in Christchurch in 2014.

The teenager was from a different school and told Christchurch District Court she had a crush on the 46-year-old, who sent her explicit text messages to spark their relationship.

The pair had sex twice in McMillan's house between 2014 and 2016, with his wife asleep in the home on both occasions.

They also had sex a year later in a cemetery when the teenager was of consensual age.

A mutual friend became aware of their relationship after finding messages the pair had sent each other.

Stuff reported the teenager said she felt 'gross' and 'stupid' after their relationship.

McMillan did not deny his sexual relationship with the young girl, but said it did not begin while she was underage.

The jury found McMillan guilty of meeting a young person following sexual grooming and three charges of sexual connection with a person under 16.

He was let off on another charge of supplying cannabis to a young person. 

McMillan will be sentenced in October.

The former teacher stopped working at Kingslea in 2016 after the New Zealand Teachers Disciplinary Tribunal censured him for smoking cannabis.
