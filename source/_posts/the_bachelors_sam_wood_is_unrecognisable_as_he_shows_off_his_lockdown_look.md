The Bachelor's Sam Wood has revealed a dramatic new look. 

The reality star showed off the disastrous results of an at-home haircut from his wife Snezana on Wednesday. 

He then compared himself to an 'oompa loompa'.  

Oh dear: The Bachelor's Sam Wood has revealed a dramatic new look. The reality star showed off the disastrous results of an at-home haircut from his wife Snezana on Wednesday 

'Hi, my name is Bob. I let my wife give me a Covid cut,' Sam wrote alongside a selfie of himself.

Sam's shoulder length hair was cut to just below his ears, causing his tresses to fall in ringlets.  

My, how you've changed! Like many people stuck in Melbourne during lockdown, Sam has sported a very relaxed look this year. (L) on The Bachelor in 2015, and right last month

Sam's fans couldn't get enough of the hilarious haircut, with one writing: 'Soo funny!! Just sums up the craziness / sh*t show of 2020!'  

Another added: 'If 2020 was a haircut, this is it.'

Meanwhile, one said: 'Just need an orange tan and a green dye to go with the cut and we're set!!!!'

Like most of us, Sam has been merrily sporting a very different lockdown look this year. 

He has grown out his usually cropped hair into long, grey-streaked tresses. 

The star's shaggy 'do was complemented by a rugged beard and moustache which he only recently shaved.

Sam is currently self-isolating with his wife, Snezana, 39, and their three children, Charlie, one, Willow, two, and 14-year-old Eve - Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship.

In July, the fitness expert spoke to FEMAIL about how people who have gained weight in self-isolation can easily achieve their pre-lockdown figure.   

'Moving your body in some way every day is most important,' Sam explained. 

'It doesn't matter how and when - but it is good to mix it up, rather than doing the same workout each day,' he added.
