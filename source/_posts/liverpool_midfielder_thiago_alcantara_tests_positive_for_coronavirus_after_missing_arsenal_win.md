Liverpool first-team doctor, Dr Jim Moxon, said: 'It is the choice of each individual whether they reveal publicly the outcome of a Covid-19 test.

'We have followed all the protocols to the letter and Thiago is OK. He will be self-isolating now as per the guidelines and hopefully he'll be back with us soon.' 

Thiago took to Twitter to say 'time to heal' while former club Bayern Munich wished him a speedy recovery. 

Thiago will miss Liverpool's match against Aston Villa on Sunday and an international break follows. He should be free to return for Liverpool in their following Premier League match, against Merseyside rivals Everton on October 17. 

The north-west of England, particularly the city of Liverpool, has seen numbers of Covid-19 cases rapidly rising in recent weeks. 

According to Liverpool City Council, there are currently 1323 cases-per-week diagnosed in the city, compared to 94-per-week on September 1.

Liverpool said that Thiago has been displaying minor symptoms associated with the virus

Thiago made his Liverpool debut in the 2-0 win over Chelsea on September 20 following his move from Bayern Munich but has not featured since. 

Speaking to Sky Sports before Liverpool's match against Arsenal, Klopp said of the midfielder: 'After the international break, he will be fine - for sure. 

'That's the situation at the moment, he's not fit enough to be involved.'

The Premier League announced on Monday that there had been 10 positive tests out of 1,595 carried out between September 21 and September 27.
