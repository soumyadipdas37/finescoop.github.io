Kerry Washington was one of several celebrities who reacted strongly to the first Presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and she also got an intriguing request.

Washington, 43, was tweeting regularly during the debate, asking at one point, 'What is happening?! Is there an understudy who can step in and play the role of moderator?! #debates.'

That lead to a fan posing a rather interesting question, asking if she would moderate one of the debates as her iconic Scandal character Olivia Pope, which Washington responded to.

Twitter user Steve Flores responded, 'Can we get Olivia Pope to come moderate?! with Washington shutting that down quickly.

'There’s not enough wine in the whole wide world!!!!!!!!! #Debates2020,' Washington said, though she was no the only one to complain about moderator Chris Matthews.

The Fox News anchor was criticized by many for failing to keep order at the Debate, with Washington also retweeting another user who thought Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen would do a better job controlling the debate.

Washington starred as Washington D.C. insider Olivia Pope, a former White House Communications Director who starts her own crisis management firm.

The wildly popular series from creator Shonda Rhimes ran seven seasons on ABC between 2012 and 2018.

Washington was nominated for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress for her portrayal of Olivia Pope on Scandal.

Washington was also one of many black celebrities to speak up after many were outraged that just one of three Louisville police officers were charged in the death of Breonna Taylor.

She noted that Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky Attorney General who has come under fire for the Taylor case, is one of Trump's top choices to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.

'Daniel Cameron is on Donald Trump's short list as a replacement of #RBG on the Supreme Court. The same man who decided not to charge the officers responsible for killing Breonna Taylor. Vote,' Washington said.
