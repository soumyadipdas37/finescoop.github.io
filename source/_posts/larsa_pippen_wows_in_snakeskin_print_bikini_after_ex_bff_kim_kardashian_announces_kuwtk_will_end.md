Her ex BFF Kim announced she had made the decision to end Keeping Up With Kardashians earlier this week, after 14 years on air.  

And Larsa Pippen, who was a regular on the show, stood out from the crowd as she took to Instagram to post a racy bikini snap on Wednesday. 

The wife of NBA star Scottie, 46, showed off her ample cleavage in a snakeskin print two-piece from Pretty Little Thing as she lounged by the pool.

Mother-of-four Larsa highlighted her jaw-dropping curves and toned stomach in the scanty bikini which had tie-side bottoms. 

She wore her blonde locks in glamorous curls and accentuated her bronzed tan with a full face of make-up. 

Larsa appeared in her element as she posed by a huge balloon arch, her name in bright lights and an inflatable horse.

The post comes after her former friend Kim announced the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, in which Larsa was a show-regular.  

The iconic reality TV series has followed the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family - including sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe, half sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, brother Rob, and mother Kris Jenner - for 20 seasons aired over the past 14 years, but it has now been confirmed the show will be coming to an end with the 21st season in early 2021.

Kim announced the news on her Instagram account, where she wrote in a statement: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians'.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'

Kim went on to thank everyone who has been a part of the E! reality show over the years, and credited the series with 'changing [her] life forever'.  

Larsa had a rumoured fall out with the family earlier this year. Kourtney and Khloe unfollowed Larsa on Instagram amid the ongoing fallout from Kanye West's Twitter meltdown.

 The dramatic unfollowing was seemingly prompted after the rapper, 43, cryptically Tweeted: 'Larsa' along with a thinking face emoji, followed by the question: 'Should I name more?'

A search of the reality TV sisters' Instagram accounts shows neither of them - or sister Kim- follow the wife of NBA legend Scottie Pippen.

Larsa appeared to respond by unfollowing the famous sisters, including her BFF Kim, and the following morning appeared to address the rumours as she shared a post in which she revealed she was 'praying that everybody finds peace'.
