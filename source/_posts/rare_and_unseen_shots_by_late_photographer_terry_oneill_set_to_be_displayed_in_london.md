A selection of rare and previously unseen images by iconic late photographer Terry O'Neill are set to be displayed in a London collection this autumn.

Mr O'Neill, who rose to fame capturing the explosion of London's youth culture in the 1960s, died at home in November aged 81 following a long battle with prostate cancer. 

During his 60 year career he chronicled the cultural landscape of music and art,  photographing celebrities including Judy Garland, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and Kate Moss.

Now a collection of thirteen rare and previously unseen shots of the stars, including one of the German actress Marlene Dietrich walking on stage in London in 1975, will be on show at London's Zebra One Gallery from September 15-29.

The images include previously unseen shots of David Bowie, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland and Raquel Welch.

Terry was best known for pictures of Elton John, a number of which appeared in his 2008 book Eltonography.

He also photographed members of the British royal family, and prominent politicians - including Sir Winston Churchill.

His photographs of Elton John are among his most well-known, and among his famous images is on of Faye Dunaway reclining by the pool with her Oscar - with whom he was married.

Other vintage images to go on display at the gallery include American actress' and singers Liza Minelli and Judy Garland performing at the London Palladium, 1964

One of his last major public appearances was when he collected his CBE for services to photography from the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace in October last year. 

After receiving his honour last October Terry, who had been suffering from prostate cancer and was in a wheelchair, said the award 'surpasses anything I've had happen to me in my life'.  

The British photographer was born on 30 July 1938 in Heston, West London, and originally aspired to be a jazz drummer due to his love of music. 

He tried to get a job as a steward at an airline, thinking this would let him travel to New York to play in the jazz clubs, but there were no positions available.

Terry, who was awarded a CBE last year, also captured English singer, musician and actor David Bowie for a magazine in Los Angeles, circa 1974

Instead he managed to get a job in photography and took a shot that would change his life.

He said: 'Part of my work was to take photographs of people arriving and departing at the terminals. I happened upon a very well-dressed bowler-hatted man, taking a quick nap in the departures area, and he was surrounded by African chieftains, fully clad in their regalia. 

'Soon after, I was approached by an editor who told me that they wanted to show the photo to his paper. 

'The man napping turned out to be then Home Secretary Rab Butler.

Over a sixty year career, Terry captured the cultural landscape with photographs (pictured,American singer and actor Frank Sinatra on set during the making of 'The Lady In Cement' in Miami, 1968)

'The paper ran my photo and I was off and running. I was offered a job at the Daily Sketch where I worked for several years before going out on my own.'

Following that success he went on to document what became known as the Swinging Sixties, taking pictures of The Beatles and Rolling Stones. 

His images have burst out from iconic albums, movie posters and magazine covers and by 1965 he was being sought out for work by the biggest magazines and newspapers in the world.

The Royal Photographic Society said he had grasped that the youth culture of the 1960s was a key moment in time globally and he began to record the new faces in film, fashion and music who would go on to become megastars.

His work which captures the Swinging Sixties includes The Beatles and The Rolling Stones when they were still struggling young bands along with David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton and Chuck Berry.

In the 1970s he became well-known for his pictures of Elton John, who was a rising star at the time.

Film stars such as Sir Michael Caine and Raquel Welch remained lifelong friends.

The Queen and former South African president Nelson Mandela have posed for portraits from Mr O'Neill and striking images of former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill are also among his archive.

Footballers Bobby Moore, Franz Beckenbauer, Pele, George Best, manager Brian Clough, boxer Muhammad Ali and Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan are among the sporting greats whom he has captured.

Mr O'Neill's work reads like a who's who in music, film, and celebrity which helped to visually define the 1960s ranging from Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Terence Stamp, Jean Shrimpton, Tom Jones, and Frank Sinatra through to singers Bruce Springsteen, Amy Winehouse and U2 in recent decades.

Iconic Images also point out that Mr O'Neill was also one of the first photographers to work with a new franchise starring actor Sean Connery as James Bond.

Mr O'Neill went on to work on several Bond films throughout the decades, including several with Sir Roger Moore.
