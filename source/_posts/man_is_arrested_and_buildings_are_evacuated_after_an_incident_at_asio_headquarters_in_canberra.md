A man has been arrested and buildings have been evacuated following a 'security incident' outside the ASIO headquarters in Canberra. 

The public are being urged to avoid the area which has since been blocked off by police. 

'ACT Policing is currently responding to an incident at a building on Constitution Ave,' an ACT Policing spokesman said on Wednesday afternoon.

'The road has been closed between Anzac Parade and Russell Offices.

'A man is in custody, although some nearby buildings have been evacuated as a precaution, there is no threat to the wider community. 

'The public is asked to stay away from the closed-off area.' 

More to come.
