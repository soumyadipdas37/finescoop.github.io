A White Island eruption survivor has shown off her incredible recovery from horrifically burned legs after the devastating volcano blast.

Stephanie Browitt suffered burns to 70 per cent of her body and needed her fingers amputated after being caught in the horror eruption near Whakatane, New Zealand, last December.

47 people were trapped on the island when the volcano blew, sending ash, rocks, debris and 300C steam into the air at more than 100 metres per second.

The 24-year-old is among 26 survivors of the blast and now wears a full face mask to protect her healing skin.

Ms Browitt took to Instagram on Tuesday to show how well her legs have recovered from her burns treatment.

She uploaded three pictures of her legs dating back to April 27, highlighting the incredible transformation her body has gone through in her healing. 

'My skin colour is improving amazingly and it's so exciting to see,' Ms Browitt posted.

'I'm also starting to find areas of my legs that have returned back to being soft and supple like skin should feel.

'Any sight of improvement is always a great boost of motivation for me to keep going and to stay strong and hopeful.

'I know that this journey has definitely made feel so grateful towards my body and what it can do.

'My skin colour is improving AMAZINGLY and it’s so exciting to see,' Ms Browitt posted with this pictured dated 8 September

'The human body is just amazing. We should definitely feel thankful towards our bodies and what they can endure for us.' 

Ms Browitt spent seven months recovering in hospital after the eruption.

Her 21-year-old sister Krystal and father Paul were among 16 Australians who died in the blast.

When first responders arrived on the scene after the explosion, Mr Browitt urged them to save his girls before coming back for him.

Krystal was killed in the initial blast, while Mr Browitt died later in hospital.

Ms Browitt has previously said despite the time that passed, she remembers the eruption like it was 'just yesterday'.

'Honestly, every time it's the ninth of each month I can feel my heart racing and my body tense as the memory of it floods back in my mind,' Ms Browitt wrote on Instagram.

 The White Island volcano erupted on December 9 2019, with 47 people trapped on the island leaving 21 dead

'I get anxious. I hate it so much, it does not get easier. It just hurts more and more when I think about how much time has passed since I was last with my dad and sister.'

Ms Browitt said she keeps wishing she could turn back time and at least have looked for her sister and father and sat with them during the aftermath.

'We're just picking up the pieces of our new lives and doing the best that we can do,' she said.

'I just want to thank everyone for your kindness, compassion and constant support. You guys manage to put a smile on my face, even if just for a second.'

Before the tragedy more than 18,000 tourists would visit the White Island volcano each year.

Six days before the eruption, on December 3 2019, volcanologists raised the alert level of White Island to level two, which is the most dangerous level a volcano can be classified as without erupting.

This was due to an increase in tremor levels, gas and unrest at the site.

A similar eruption occurred at White Island in 2016, but it was at night and no one was there. 

24 Australians were among 47 tourists on New Zealand's White Island when it erupted.
