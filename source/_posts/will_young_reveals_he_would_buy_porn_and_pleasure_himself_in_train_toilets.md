Will Young has confessed he used to perform solo sex acts on trains as he battled with the 'shame and frustration' of his sexuality.

The Pop Idol winner admitted he would buy gay porn mags and pleasure himself in the toilets when he was travelling from London to his Berkshire home in the 'countryside', while also revealing he shelled out a fortune phoning sex chat lines.

Writing in his autobiography To Be A Gay Man, Will, 41, detailed how he would buy gay porn magazines in Victoria Station and while travelling home to the countryside he would perform solo sex acts in the toilet on the train. 

Struggle: Will Young has confessed he used to perform solo sex acts on trains as he battled with the 'shame and frustration' of his sexuality

In his candid tome, Will discussed battling with his sexuality and how he felt 'more and more frustrated' with his identity. 

He explained his routine became buying the magazines, taking them on the train, pleasuring himself, putting the magazines in the bin and going about life - but confessed he felt a constant sense of shame. 

Speaking of his desire to 'push boundaries' he detailed: 'That summer, I started pushing the boundaries as far as I could. I noticed in the tube station in Victoria there was a newsagent that had gay porn mags.

'It seemed odd that this particular shop had them, as I had never seen them in a newsagent before. It took me a few weeks to build up my courage, but one day I went in and purchased three of these magazines.

'As I went up to the till, the feeling of dread I had was almost overpowering. I felt as though something awful was going to happen: the shopkeeper would make some comment or judgement, and people in the shop would point and stare at me.

'Even after buying the magazines, I felt that everyone in the tube station knew what I was up to. It was a mixture of terror and guilt. When I got to the train to take me back to the countryside and to home, I went to the loo and looked through the magazines.

'I went quickly through them and then squashed them into the bin before I got off the train so that there was no evidence. This became a routine for me.

'Each time before leaving London, I'd go to this particular newsagent and buy another magazine or two. Then I'd read them on the train, have a w**k, and deposit the evidence in the train bin before getting off at my stop.

'Slowly, I was finding my own sexuality through these magazines. The interesting thing was that it was done very much in secret and under a veil of guilt and shame, yet it was happening.'

As well as the magazines, he would also call sex hotlines.

He went on: 'I found phone numbers in the back of the magazines, and would often go to pay phones and ring them just to hear some super creepy recording of a man speaking about a sexual encounter he'd had.

'Basically, it was a recording of someone reading a raunchy gay story, and it cost a fortune! I would have to keep on throwing pound coins into the slot to get just a meagre two minutes of story, read by a creepy-sounding American guy.

'As time went on, I became more and more frustrated, and I realised I couldn't really hold it in anymore. It was the winter when I went off travelling to Australia for several months, before returning to retake my A levels. Somehow, I knew what I wanted was out there.' 

Discussion: Speaking on the Channel 4 show to hosts Tim Lovejoy and Simon Rimmer, the Leave Right Now hitmaker recalled the 'awful, internalised shame' he felt growing up gay

Earlier this month, Will spoke candidly about the 'internalised shame' he felt about being gay while growing up. The singer appeared on Channel 4 show Sunday Brunch and admitted the last decade has seen him confront feelings about his sexuality.

He admitted he only discovered he felt 'gay shame' at the age of 32.

Speaking on the Channel 4 show to hosts Tim Lovejoy and Simon Rimmer, the Leave Right Now hitmaker recalled the 'awful, internalised shame' he felt growing up gay. 

 He said: 'I was doing this podcast, it was an LGBT podcast, and a lot of gay shame came up a lot. Gay shame is a particular thing when if you are growing up feeling like you are wrong in society...

'All the messages that you are getting from movies, TV, I mean this is like back in the day, so much better now, is that you are defunct and you are wrong.

'It creates this awful, internalised shame and it starts from when you are really young and its a topic that is quite under-explored.'
