Britney Spears revealed in new court filings that she's done with live performances — at least for the time being.

The 38-year-old pop icon made the disclosure as her battle with her father Jamie Spears has intensified over her ongoing conservatorship.

In new filings obtained by TMZ, the singer objected to her father's attempts to bring back Andrew Wallet as a co-conservator, a job he held from 2008–2019.

But dad Jamie has hit back, claiming Britney's stated objections to Wallet's appointment are inaccurate and requesting a hearing to determine the facts in his own legal docs.

In the documents, Spears says she won't be performing live in the near future, though she doesn't say if she's stopping long term.

However, she does say she'll need to be mindful of her expenses without that cashflow, and she expects to make 'difficult budgetary choices going forward.'

But the songstress fears her father is ignoring her needs to conserve her funds by bring back Wallet to work with him as co-conservator.

She said Wallet was 'uniquely unsuited' to manage her estate, a role for which he earned millions of dollars over the years.

Britney says that he was raking in almost half a million dollars per year in his final five years on the job, and he also received a $100,000 payout after he resigned from the position in March 2019.

Because of her decreased revenue without live performances, which are also mostly impossible due to the ongoing pandemic, the Toxic singer doesn't want Wallet siphoning off her funds.

She previously suggested that a larger financial institution might be better equipped to serve as co-conservator with her father, rather than his hand-picked collaborator. 

Currently, Jamie serves as the sole conservator over Britney's person and her business affairs.

She previously tried to remove her father as conservator over her person, but he was left in his position following an August court date.

Sources spoke to TMZ at the time and said that Britney's mental state has not been well over the past year, and that documents haven't been filed yet that are needed to possibly remove her father.

Exacerbating the battle over the singer's conservatorship is a disagreement between her divorced parents.

Her mother Lynne Spears 'wants a care plan established that would transition Britney's personal life out of the conservatorship,' according to Us Weekly, but Jamie thinks his daughter will need long-term monitoring and isn't in a good enough place to ease her conservatorship.

Throughout her recent legal struggles, Britney's fans have organized as the #FreeBritney movement.

They're seeking to have her conservatorship ended or lessened, and they believe she's being held hostage by her caretakers.

The pop star has recently been trying to unseal court documents so that they public could see them, and her lawyer expressed support for the movement earlier this month.

Upside down: On Monday evening, Britney shared photos of her doing handstands to her Insta Stories. She wore a pink tank top and gray shorts in two photos, one from her gym and one outside

Although she was engaged in legal battles behind the scenes, Britney has been putting on a cheery performance on Instagram, even if some fans worry it's all fake.

The singer–songwriter showed off her impressive figure later on Monday evening with a series of photos of herself doing hand stands.

One photos showed her in a pin tank top and gray shorts standing on her hands against her gym wall, while another showed her in a similar outfit upside down against a tree.

A third picture showed off her abs and she stretched her legs in opposite directions from the middle of her gym.
