Soon after she was announced as the winner, fans of the show voice their bitter disappointment on Twitter with savage criticism. 

'Who the hell is she?' Viewers have slammed The Masked Singer finale and savaged Bonnie Anderson's win after she was unmasked as The Bushranger on Monday night 

'Who or what is a Bonnie Anderson...At 28, I've actually aged out of The Masked Singer. Sayonara season three,' one viewer wrote.
