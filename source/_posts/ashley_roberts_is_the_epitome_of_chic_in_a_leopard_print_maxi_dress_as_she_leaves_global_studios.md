Ashley Roberts cut a very stylish figure as she left to work at Heart FM in London's Global Studios on Friday.

The radio presenter, 38, was the epitome of chic in a leopard print maxi dress as she confidently strutted down the street. 

Ashley appeared in great spirits as she flashed a broad smile after presenting her breakfast radio show.

The Pussycat Doll was full of confidence in her animal print gown which featured a billowing skirt and a tie detail that cinched her in at the waist.

Ashley boosted her height with a pointed pair of nude heels, while she accessorised with trendy shades and a black handbag. 

The beauty left her blonde locks loose on her shoulders, while she added a subtle palette of make-up to her face.   

It comes after Ashley took to Instagram on Sunday evening to share a scenic bikini-clad snap by the sea in Turkey.

The Don't Cha hitmaker looked phenomenal as she drank in her surroundings while donning a barely-there red two-piece. 

She added a caption on the duo of snaps reading: 'She holy hunni. How beautiful?! Here’s to looking and hoping for a brighter rest of 2020 #wecanhope #adventure #motherearth #grateful'.

Ashley revealed last month she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption. 

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29. 

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. 

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.' 

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'
