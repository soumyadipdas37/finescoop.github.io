Joshua Kimmich exhibited some world-class improvisation to score the goal that saw Bayern Munich triumph over Borussia Dortmund to claim the German Super Cup.

Kimmich's late winner on Wednesday night helped Bayern lift their second trophy of the 2020-2021 season after winning 3-2 in the 82nd minute.

However, fans have been divided on whether the 25-year-old meant to score in such fashion or whether it was simply luck.

Joshua Kimmich exhibited some world-class improvisation to score the late winner for Bayern

The goal came from a text-book counter attack after Kimmich intercepted the ball on the halfway line. 

Charging down the pitch at pace, Kimmich played in Robert Lewandowski before receiving the ball back.

The German international picked up the ball between the edge of the box and the penalty stop and shot at goal.

Goalkeeper Marwin Hitz made an initial save but what happened next was never to be expected.

As Kimmich fell to the ground, the 25-year-old managed to connect with the rebound to flick the ball past the Dortmund keeper to secure a win for Bayern. 

Fans were quick to take to social media to discuss whether the striker's goal was pure luck or calculated.  







Some fans felt that Kimmich meant to connect with the ball in the way that he did. 

One Twitter user wrote: 'Of course he did, clearly see his leg go out to meet the ball. Great instincts.'

Another added: 'He definitely meant that! You can see the way he moves his foot towards the ball and angles it too! Amazing goal!!' 

While others claimed that the 25-year-old could never seen have happening coming but believed he made an attempt to connect with the ball. 

One fan Tweeted: 'He meant to shove his foot out and hope to do something with the ball. Did he mean exactly that to happen? Nah, just shove a foot out and hope.'

Others, however, took a more cynical approach, saying: 'Anyone who knows football knows he didn't mean that. Silly question'.

Speaking of his team-mates goal, Manuel Neuer said it was combination of 'will and talent'

While Bayern manager Hansi Flick said that Kimmich's 'mentality has been very special'

Speaking of his team-mates goal, Manuel Neuer said it was combination of 'will and talent'. 

He said: 'That was will and talent at the same time. He did not stay on the ground and still chips the ball in. He's just a good player.' 

Bayern head coach Hansi Flick agreed with his goalkeeper's comment, telling ZDF: 'As long as I've known him, his mentality has been very special. He is well on his way to being one of those players who shapes this team and this club.

'I always look, when can I give him a break? But then you have to reckon with his anger, he always wants to be on the pitch.'
