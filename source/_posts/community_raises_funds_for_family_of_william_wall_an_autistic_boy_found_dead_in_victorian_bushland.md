Compassionate neighbours have come together to support a family grieving the death of their autistic teenage son.

William Wall, 14, was found dead on Wednesday afternoon in bushland at Yarra Junction, east of Melbourne.  

His disappearance on Tuesday morning sparked a major search operation in the hopes he may be found alive. His death was ruled as a suicide.

As the community deals with the loss of the 'beautiful and caring' teenager they have launched a crowdfunding campaign to help lessen the family's financial strain.  

William Wall (Pictured), 14, was found dead at Yarra Junction, Melbourne on Wednesday, 32 hours after going missing on his daily jog on Tuesday

Almost $20,000 had been raised by late Thursday, with more than 300 donations on the GoFundme page.

The page was set up by local residents Nikki Callaghan and Liz Wilkinson in an effort to show their support without intruding on the family's privacy. 

'We are all aching for the Wall family at the moment,' the page reads. 

'The community is struggling to come to terms with this tragic loss of such a beautiful boy, we couldn't possibly imagine what the family is going through at this time.'

The creator of the page said she was 'only a neighbour' and was trying to make contact with the family to make sure they can access the donated funds as soon as possible.

'The community wants to help in some sort of way, to take the financial strain off the family at this time,' the page reads.

'This Gofundme is just to help them out with the cost of the funeral or anything else they may need so they don't have to worry about money and can focus on being together as a family.'

 Hundreds of people have shared well wishes for the family as they pledged donations.

'Hope the memories of your beautiful boy wrap and comfort you always,' one woman wrote.

'We are heartbroken at William's death. We send prayers and love in support,' another donor wrote. 

The teenager's father penned an emotional tribute to his son earlier Thursday, just hours after the confirmation of his death. 

'I wish I had better news regarding our beautiful and caring son and brother William Wall unfortunately he is no longer with us,' Shane Wall wrote on Facebook on Thursday.

'We don't know how to begin to thank everyone who searched and supported us in the last 48hrs the list is endless. We are so fortunate to live in an amazing and supportive community.'

For 32 frantic hours, rescuers and volunteers combed bushland in the hope of finding William alive.

The 14-year old had last been seen going for a jog on Tuesday morning.

But when police put out a statement on Wednesday afternoon confirming the autistic teenager had been found dead, it read that 'his death is not being treated as suspicious.'

It was later confirmed that William's death was a suicide.

A day earlier, Mr Wall had told reporters his son had dreams of becoming a Victoria Police or Australian Federal Police officer and joining the Air Force.

He said William loved dogs and exercise, was very energetic and athletic.

The teenager had gone out for his daily jog along the Yarra Ranges' Warburton Trail at 6.45am on Tuesday, promising his family he would be back in 15 minutes. 

But he never returned to his home in Launching Place. 

It remains unknown how long William had been dead before his body was found.

In all likeliness, the search - perhaps unbeknownst to those that participated - was a recovery mission from the start.  

William's disappearance had sparked an air and ground search involving about 100 personnel from Victoria Police and the State Emergency Service.

William's body was found in bushland at the end of a residential street less than two kilometres from his home, and family gathered there on Wednesday evening.

Distraught rescuers and locals were also seen consoling each other at the scene. 

Family friend Tyson Truscott said the Walls would be shattered by the tragedy. 

William's dad Shane Wall fought back tears during a press conference on Wednesday, several hours before the search for his son came to a tragic end

'He was a great kid. There is nothing bad about him. He loved going for runs, he went flat out,' he told the Herald Sun.

William had a younger sister, Sophie, and two older brothers Jake and Harrison, who joined the search effort on Tuesday night.

William's disappearance had come three months after non-verbal autistic teen William Callaghan became separated from his family during a walk at Mount Disappointment, 60km north of Melbourne.

The teen spent two nights alone before being miraculously found safe and well.  

For William's family, there would be no similar happy ending.
