She's said she's convinced she and her beloved Maltipoo Elvis knew each other in a previous life.

And once again on Monday, Lucy Hale gushed over her pup in an Instagram post.

Posing with the dog in her lap, she shared a selfie video to her Instagram Story with the legend: 'The nose kills me.'

Love me, love my dog: She's convinced she and her Maltipoo Elvis knew each other in a previous life. And once again on Monday, Lucy Hale gushed over her pup in an Instagram post

In the images, the Pretty Little liars alum gazes directly into the camera as she rests her head in one hand and smiles sweetly.

Her dark hair is tied back from her face and she's wearing several gold rings and gold earrings.

Elvis is wearing a green collar with silver bone-shaped name tag.

In a separate snap, the white fluffy pooch is seen posing with a large bone name plate as he sits on an arm chair.

Hale is so devoted to Elvis - or Elvy as she likes to call him - that she got his name inked in cursive on her arm earlier this summer.

Back in May, the actress told Elle that she believes she and Elvis, whom she adopted in 2016, knew each other in a previous life. 

'I totally believe in reincarnation and I know for a fact that I have known Elvis in a life before because we are just entirely too connected,' she said in the 'Ask Me Anything' video for Elle.

And she's previously proudly shown off the pup doing the viral Toddler Challenge, which is designed to teach toddlers patience as they wait for permission from mom or dad before being able to eat a sweet treat.

In Hale's clip, her Maltipoo is sitting at a table as she sits next to him, opening a bag of dog treats.

'You can have these treats but you're going to have to wait for them till I get back,' she tells the pup.

Elvis puts one paw up onto the table as he moves towards the snacks.

'No, you've gonna have to wait till I get back, right,' Hale admonishes the dog as she places his paw down again.

She then walks away and leaves Elvis sitting at the table for about 20 seconds before squealing with delight at his obedience and returning to shower him in praise. 

'Elvy is such a good boy! You're such a good boy!' she says. 

'Okay, you can have them,' she tells him as she moves the treats closer to him.

Learning patience: In May, Hale posted a cute video to her Instagram in which did the viral Toddler Challenge with Elvis

Tease: 'You can have these treats but you're going to have to wait for them till I get back,' she tells the pup after opening up a bag of doggie snacks and placing them on the table

I got this: She then walks away for about 20 seconds leaving the dog sitting at the table with the treats in front of him and not stirring

Impressive: 'Elvy is such a good boy! You're such a good boy!' Hale gushes as she returns to the table. 'Okay, you can have them,' she tells him as  show showers the pup with praise
