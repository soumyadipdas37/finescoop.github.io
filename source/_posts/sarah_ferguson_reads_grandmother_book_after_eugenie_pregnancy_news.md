The Duchess of York has delighted fans by reading a book about a magical grandmother on her YouTube series - just hours after her daughter Princess Eugenie announced she is pregnant with her first child.

Sarah Ferguson, 60, opted to read Nanna Maureen by Casey Gillespie - which tells the heartwarming, rhyming tale of a magical and invisible grandmother who looks out for the children - for her series Story Time With Fergie and Friends.   

The video was shared shortly after Buckingham Palace announced Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank are expecting their first child together. 

The couple, who married in October 2018, are expecting the baby in early 2021.

Taking to the comments section, one royal fan penned: 'Perhaps change the name to nanna Sarah for today.....lovely news' (pictured)

The children's book was written by Casey especially for her children and niece - and was inspired by her mother who passed away years before becoming a Nanna. 

'It's very good - are you ready for all those Nannas, out there? Grannies, Grandmpas, Nannas and everybody out there - it's dead exciting!' Fergie can be heard saying, as she prepares to start reading.

And royal fans were delighted with the 'appropriate' choice of tale about a grandmother - with one even suggesting the Duchess of York should change the name to 'Sarah' for the day - in celebration of her daughter's happy news. 

'Congratulations appropriate book to be reading,' enthused one, while a second commented: 'Perhaps change the name to nanna Sarah for today.....lovely news.' 



Pitter patter of tiny feet! Eugenie, 30, shared the news on Instagram with a sweet photo of baby slippers and the caption: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021

A third added: 'Congratulations! Just think of all the special times you'll have reading to your new grandchild!'

Meanwhile, the author of the book commented: 'Thanks so much for sharing my book and congratulations to you.' 

Buckingham Palace released a statement this morning that read: 'Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and Mr Jack Brooksbank are very pleased to announce that they are expecting a baby in early 2021.

'The Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York, Mr and Mrs George Brooksbank, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted with the news.'

Princess Eugenie shared the news on her Instagram shortly afterwards.

The Royal Family shared their congratulations on social media, echoing the best wishes expressed in the statement and accompanying them with a sweet photo of the couple on their wedding day in October 2018.

Sarah Ferguson added to the well-wishes this afternoon. Speaking to Hello!, she said: 'Soon to be Granny and Granddad are absolutely overjoyed!'
