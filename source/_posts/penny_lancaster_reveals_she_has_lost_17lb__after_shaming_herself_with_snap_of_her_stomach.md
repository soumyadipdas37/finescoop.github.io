Many of us piled on the pounds during lockdown, and Penny Lancaster was no different.

But the former model was so mortified by the extra stone she had put on, that she took a photo of her stomach and used it as an incentive to lose weight again.

The 49-year-old wife of Sir Rod Stewart, 75, has now revealed she has lost more than 17lb in eight weeks after improving her diet and doing more exercise.

Posting the before and after pictures on Instagram, she wrote: ‘During the lockdown I found myself entering my menopause and the side effects were exaggerated by the anxiety and fear for the virus and the unknown.

‘I turned to food and drink as comfort and gained over a stone. As a wake up call I shamed [myself] by taking a photo. It worked and with a new diet and exercise, I lost 17lb and 4in off my waist in eight weeks!’

Miss Lancaster is mother to two sons – Alastair, 14, and Aiden, nine, with Sir Rod.

She told ITV’s Loose Women in August that the onset of the menopause had been a struggle, and at one point she had even thrown a meal across the room.

She said: ‘I was in the kitchen, it had been one of those days where everything had been going wrong.

‘I ended up throwing the dinner across the kitchen. I just screamed and burst into tears. The boys came and hugged me.’  

The TV star admitted she has found the past few months extra tough because of her symptoms, but gushed that her husband and sons have been very understanding.

She added: 'Rod and I have a very close and intimate, open relationship about all sorts of things.   

She said: ‘I turned to food and drink as comfort and gained over a stone. As a wake up call I shamed [myself] by taking a photo. It worked and with a new diet and exercise, I lost 17lb and 4in off my waist in eight weeks!’

 'I talk to him about how I'm feeling in the lead up to my period, feeling a little down or sad or… I always say, "Darling give me space today, it's the time of the month." 

'I've explained to them [my family] about the hormones I'm experiencing since March, my last period.

'I've been having the really hot sweats, and then freezing cold… my body temperature is fluctuating all over the place. It affects your mood swings, I've been putting on more weight.'

Happy couple: The star has been married to music legend Sir Rod Stewart since 2007 and the couple share two sons
