A worker feared the 'Loch Ness Monster' was about to attack him before realising he was watching a kangaroo struggling to breathe while trapped in black industrial ooze. 

Steve was excavating a seven-metre pit at the Cleanaway plant in Campbellfield, 16km north of Melbourne, on Wednesday when he spotted an animal floating in the sludge. 

His boss Daniel Halemba rushed over to his employee, who said he feared the 'frightening creature' was the mythical beast known as 'Nessie'.

Upon closer inspection, it was identified as an eastern grey kangaroo who had gotten stuck in the seven metre deep pit filled with industrial ooze 

'The words that were expressed to me was probably not suitable for your publication. It was all pretty freaky to be honest,' Mr Halemba told Yahoo News Australia.

The pair soon realised the animal was an eastern grey kangaroo, which was covered in a thick mix of oil, bitumen and sawdust after becoming trapped in the pit.   

Animal rescuers were contacted, but the pair could not wait around for them watching the struggling animal. 

They created a noose to help bring the kangaroo out of the seven-metre deep pit. 

'We essentially made up a noose, dropped it into the pit with a little bit of finesse, and a couple of broomstick handles,' Mr Halemba said. 

The pulled the roo out, wrapped the marsupial with a towel and gave him some water.

Mr Halemba said the kangaroo was not happy and kept 'hissing' at him following its ordeal in the pit.

Wildlife Rescuer volunteer Leone Sorrentino said the kangaroo had to be euthanised after being stuck in the pit and consuming the content

Wildlife Rescuers Inc volunteer Leone Sorrentino arrived and was shocked at the sight in front of her.  

She said the kangaroo was 'very angry, very distressed' after digesting some of the sludge. 

Ms Sorrentino was heartbroken and had no choice but to euthanise the marsupial, which had no hope of survival. 

'It was just horrific, these last moments of his life, and he's in some pit,' she said. 

She suggested covers be placed over pits to ensure the incident isn't repeated.
