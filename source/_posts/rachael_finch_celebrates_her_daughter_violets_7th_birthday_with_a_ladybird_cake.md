Rachael Finch has celebrated her daughter, Violet's 7th birthday with a party in the park.

The former beauty queen, 32, shared a series of photos from the special day, which included a ladybird birthday cake, based on the children's cartoon Miraculous Ladybug.

She posted a family photo of herself with her husband Michael, their three-year-old son Dominic, and the birthday girl.
