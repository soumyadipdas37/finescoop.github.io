British billionaire Lord Alan Sugar and his wife Ann Simons were given special treatment upon their arrival in Australia on Thursday.

The couple were granted permission by the New South Wales Government to self-isolate at a private venue instead of a quarantine hotel for two weeks. 

Unlike other travellers who are being forced to pay a $2,800 hotel quarantine bill upon their return to Australia, the business magnate, 73, and wife Ann were allowed to head straight to the unknown property.

Quarantine: British billionaire Lord Alan Sugar and his wife have avoided hotel quarantine after arriving in Sydney - as they're granted permission to isolate privately

Inbound travellers are being made to quarantine in hotels at their own expense to limit the spread of COVID-19 as the country faces the threat of a second wave of infection after cases spiked in the state of Victoria.  

A NSW Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia on Sunday, the British lord and his wife had submitted a proposal to quarantine in a private facility.

'The couple is compliant with the Public Health (COVID-19 Air Transportation Quarantine) Order (No 2) 2020 and did not require an exemption from quarantine requirements.'

'The couple submitted a proposal to acquire appropriate, independent locations to be nominated as 'Quarantine Facilities' as allowed under the Public Health Order.'

The spokesperson said: 'The couple is required to abide by the same regulations as any other returned traveller.'

Meanwhile, a Nine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Bringing Lord Alan Sugar to Australia has been months in the making, and all the regular processes were followed, with no special treatment being given.'

'Lord Sugar is currently serving the mandatory two week quarantine in a Government-approved facility.'  

Daily Mail Australia has also contacted Lord Sugar's office for comment.





Quarantine: After arriving in Australia on an Emirates flight last week, Lord Sugar tweeted that it was his first trip on a commercial airline in 25 years as he normally travels by private jet and responded to people asking whether he would have to quarantine

The couple's arrival Down Under comes as Lord Sugar prepares to film Channel Nine's Celebrity Apprentice Australia.

The 73-year-old, who has appeared on 15 seasons of the hit show in the UK, will eliminate the celebrities with his signature catchphrase 'you're fired'.

After arriving in Australia on an Emirates flight last week, Lord Sugar tweeted that it was his first trip on a commercial airline in 25 years as he normally travels by private jet. 

'I have never experienced service like it in all my life,' he said. 'It was fantastic. Both on the ground and in the air. Amazing. For the sceptics, it was fully paid for, not free.'

He then responded to several people asking whether he would have to quarantine and said he had to have a COVID-19 test to board the plane, wear a mask during the flight, and spend 14 days in isolation.

'Same rules for me and a tosser like you,' he said to one Twitter user.

Lord Sugar has made most of his fortune from his property company Amsprop, which he owns with his son, Daniel Sugar.

In 1968, the businessman also launched consumer electronics company Amstrad but sold his interest in the company in 2007.
