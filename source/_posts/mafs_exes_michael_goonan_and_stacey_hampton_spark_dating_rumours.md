They had one of the nastiest break-ups in Married At First Sight history.

But despite endless arguments and cheating allegations on the show, it seems Stacey Hampton and Michael Goonan are now firm friends.

The exes, who were paired on season seven of Nine's social experiment, enjoyed a relaxed outing at the Burleigh Pavilion bar on the Gold Coast on Saturday.

Something to tell us? Married At First Sight exes Michael Goonan and Stacey Hampton sparked reconciliation rumours on Saturday as they enjoyed a friendly catch-up on the Gold Coast

Stacey, 26, a single mother of two, looked very glamorous for the occasion in a flirty white skirt with a matching singlet.

She completed her outfit with chic sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton handbag, and styled her blonde hair in loose waves.

Meanwhile, 28-year-old businessman Michael flaunted his wealth by rocking a gold wristwatch and designer shades.

He otherwise kept things relatively casual in a black shirt with rolled-up sleeves, tight white pants and tan loafers.

Given the circumstances of their break-up on MAFS, Michael and Stacey's friendship has caught many fans by surprise.

The pair had ended things on bad terms at the cast reunion, which was filmed in January, when Stacey was accused of sleeping with another groom, Mikey Pembroke, which she strenuously denied.

Even before these allegations surfaced, the TV newlyweds had faced a string of setbacks - including Michael's boozy kiss with co-star Hayley Vernon (which he denied) and their bitter argument over Michael's drinking on their honeymoon.

Their closeness has sparked rumours they are dating again, but Stacey has insisted this isn't the case.

'No, we're just friends and we're civil,' the blond bombshell told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Monday.

She added that she was Michael's 'wingwoman' during their trip to the Gold Coast.

'He had a fun time. He was hooking up with multiple girls,' she said, before clarifying that she wasn't one of them.

Michael also told the radio show: 'We're just good friends. She's not that stupid [to get back with me].'
