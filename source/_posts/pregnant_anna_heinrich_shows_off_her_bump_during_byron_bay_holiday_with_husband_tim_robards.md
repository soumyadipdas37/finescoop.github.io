Bachelor winner Anna Heinrich announced in April that she is expecting her first with husband Tim Robards. 

And on Friday, she was enjoying a babymoon in Bryon Bay, showing off her blossoming bump in a bikini.

Anna, 33, posed in mismatched swimwear consisting of a black top and black and white bottoms.

She covered up with an open white shirt and wore sunglasses on her famous face, her hair worn in a loose ponytail. 

The glowing mother-to-be appeared to go makeup free and was absolutely beaming as she revealed her growing belly. 

She captioned the photo simply: 'Sun seeker'. 

Anna also shared a photo of herself with husband Tim, 37, as they posed together at the The Farm Byron Bay.

It comes after former Bachelor Tim announced he is leaving Neighbours, just two years after joining the show.

Tim, who plays wealthy businessman Pierce Greyson in the soap, was originally scheduled to film his final scenes in September - news that hadn't been announced until Wednesday.

However, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, he will wrap up four weeks early so he can return to Sydney for the arrival of his first child with wife Anna.

New chapter: Due to strict COVID-19 lockdown travel restrictions, Tim will wrap up four weeks early so he can return to Sydney for the arrival of his first child with Anna

After spending most of Anna's pregnancy in Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, Tim said he had finally been forced to choose between his career and his responsibilities as an expectant father.   

'I made the gut-wrenching decision to depart Neighbours early as my responsibilities as a husband and father have to take precedence,' he said. 

'If I've learnt anything in this pandemic it's that the health and wellbeing of my family has to come first.'
