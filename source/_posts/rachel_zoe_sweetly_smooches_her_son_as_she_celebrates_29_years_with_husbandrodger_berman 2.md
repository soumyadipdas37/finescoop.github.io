She is celebrating 29 years with her husband Rogder Berman.

And Rachel Zoe marked the occasion with a family beach day in Santa Barbara, California on Sunday. 

The fashion designer, 51, was seen sweetly kissing her son while enjoying the sunshine at Miramar Beach. 

Smooch! Rachel Zoe sweetly kissed her son during a family beach day to Santa Barbara on Sunday

Rachel leaned over to peck her son, who clutched a blue boogie board and appeared to be wearing her floppy straw hat.

The doting mom placed her hand atop her son's hat whist clad in a flowing brown dress with blonde beachy waves cascading down her chest.

Her youngster wore a long-sleeve white shirt and leaf print board shorts.

Walking along the shore on her own, Rachel looked every inch the beach babe in her boho chic ensemble.

The star peered through a pair of gold shades, while adding some metallic flair with her silver necklaces and gold bracelets.

Rachel is currently celebrating 29 years with her husband alongside her family at the swanky Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Santa Barbara, California.

Rachel began dating Rodger while attending college in Washington, D.C. in 1991, followed by their wedding in 1996.

The power couple now have sons Skyler Morrison Berman, nine, and Kaius Jagger Berman, six, together.

At the time they first met, Rodger thought Rachel was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.   

'I met Rachel in the summer of 1991. She was 19, and I was 22. She was a restaurant hostess, and I was working as a waiter in Washington, D.C., where we both attended college,' he told Harper's Bazaar in 2011. 'I vividly remember the first time I saw her, wearing a tight black minidress, high-heeled pumps, stick-straight hair, and big red lips covered in M.A.C. Chili lipstick (her trademark). 

Aww! The fashion designer affectionately pecked her youngster

'She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I quickly learned that she also had more clothes than any woman I had ever seen. I often wondered if she'd ever do an outfit change mid-date.' 

Marking the special occasion on her Instagram account, Rachel shared a throwback of herself flashing her diamond engagement ring while snuggled up to her husband.

'This is us. Me and my ❤️ @rbermanus long ago..and today we celebrate #29 years together on our official #firstdate #anniversary �� xoRZ,' she captioned the photo.

After their beach day, the family enjoyed dinner by the water, where her eldest son Skyler made a sweet toast to his parents.

'A toast to my family, and a toast to my parents for having the best anniversary, and for taking us with them, and well I just love them very much for that,' Skyler said while raising a glass of water.

Rachel was obviously touched by the gesture.

'"A toast to my family" this is #9 years old #aboutlastnight #boymom feeling extra #grateful xoRZ,' she captioned the video.
