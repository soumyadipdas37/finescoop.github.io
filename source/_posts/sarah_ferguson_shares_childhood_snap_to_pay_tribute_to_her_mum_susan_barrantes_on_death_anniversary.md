Sarah Ferguson has shared a sweet throwback image with her sister Jane and mother Susan Barrantes to pay tribute to the late film producer on the 22nd anniversary of her death.

The Duchess of York, 60,  who has been staying at Royal Lodge in Windsor since the beginning of lockdown, posted the adorable family shot of the red-haired sisters that bare a striking resemblance to Princess Eugenie and Beatrice, sitting on a lake in Scotland with their pet poodle.

Sarah Ferguson has shared a sweet throwback image with her sister Jane and mother Susan Barrantes to pay tribute to the late film producer on the 22nd anniversary of her death. The Duchess of York, 60, who has been staying at Royal Lodge in Windsor since the beginning of lockdown, posted the adorable family shot of the red-haired sisters that bare a striking resemblance to Princess Eugenie and Beatrice, sitting on a lake in Scotland with their pet poodle.



'Happy days with Mum (always in my heart) my sister Jane and Puff the Poodle on a lake in Scotland. She died far too young .. we miss you Mum,' she captioned the image.

Susan died in 1998 following a car crash in Argentina, just one year after the death of Princess Diana.

The Duchess of York's mother earned the nickname 'the bolter' and caused a stir in British social circles when she eloped with Argentinian polo player Hector Barrantes in 1975, a year after her divorce from Fergie's father Sir Ronald Ferguson.  

Sir Ronald died in 2003 following a heart attack in Basingstoke, Hampshire.

The father-of-five, a polo manager for the Duke of Edinburgh and later Prince Charles, married Susan Deptford in 1975, a year after his divorce from Fergie's mother, also named Susan.

He shared daughters Sarah and Jane with his first wife, and son Andrew and two more daughters, Alice and Eliza with his second.     

Jane is a public relations exec who lives in Sydney with her three children Seamus, Ayesha and Heidi.

The Duchess of York was married to the Queen's second son Prince Andrew from 1986 to 1996, but the couple remain close years after their divorce.

With Andrew she shares daughters Princess Beatrice, 32, and Princess Eugenie, 30.

The royal recently announced she will be collaborating with Laleh Mohmedi, the mother behind the viral sensation, Jacob's Food Diaries to release her own cookbook Fergie's  Fun Food.
