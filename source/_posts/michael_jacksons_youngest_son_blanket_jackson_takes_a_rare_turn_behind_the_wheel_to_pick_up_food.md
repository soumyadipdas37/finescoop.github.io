He's been content to let his security guard take care of the driving around LA.

But Blanket Jackson was behind the wheel of his Cadillac Escalade on Sunday while his security sat in the passenger seat.

The 18-year-old son of Michael Jackson was spotted out in Calabasas as he picked up some Mexican food from Sharkey's in Calabasas.

Blanket was dressed casually in a T-shirt and sported his trademark long black hair.

Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, he didn't appear to be wearing a mask as he got his food.

The new driver was seen gingerly moving his SUV around the parking lot, and he headed home after getting his order.

His final destination was his massive Calabasas home, which he purchased in early March of this year.

The home, which boasts an impressive 6,382 square feet, is located in an exclusive gated community with celebrity residents including Dr. Dre and John Travolta.

The home has plenty of space for his needs and features six bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms.

Blanket was the last of Michael Jackson's three children to move out of his 90-year-old grandmother Katherine Jackson's home.

His sister Paris, 22, previously purchased a $2 million home in Topanga, California, three years earlier, while his oldest brother Michael Jackson Jr., 23, selected a $2.2 million home in Rancho Palos Verdes.

Blanket is the most reserved of the three children of the late pop icon, who died in 2009, but his sister Paris opened up on Thursday about the recent loss of two of her friends, Noah and Sofia.

The musician shared twin posts paying tribute to the late friends, though it wasn't clear when they had died or if their deaths were connected.

The singer and occasional actress documented her life over the summer in her six-part Facebook Watch docuseries Unfiltered: Paris Jackson & Gabriel Glenn.

The series detailed her musical career in the wake of her father's death, as well as her relationship with her boyfriend Gabriel, with whom she collaborates in the duo The Soundflowers.

Despite signing on for the series together, the relationship didn't last, and it was reported early last mont that the two had amicably separated.
