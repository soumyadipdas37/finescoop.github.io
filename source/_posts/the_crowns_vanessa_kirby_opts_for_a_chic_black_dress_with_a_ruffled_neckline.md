Vanessa displayed her slender pins in the simple black dress, which had a vintage twist thanks to a high ruffled neckline and matching cuffs.

The Mission Impossible star accessorised her look with ankle-strapped heels and her blonde bobbed tresses styled into loose waves.

Throughout the event, Vanessa ensured she was adhering to social distancing by arriving in her matching black face mask.

Vanessa has been in Venice to attend the launch of her newest film The World To Come, and she attended a photocall for the film on Sunday.

The World To Come is set on the American East Coast in the mid-19th century, where two neighbouring couples battle hardship and isolation, and is based upon Jim Shepard's novel of the same name.

Vanessa is known to many for her role as young Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, which she played for the show's first two seasons.

In 2018 she appeared in Mission Impossible: Fallout, and is expected to reprise her role in the upcoming seventh film, which recently resumed filming after being delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Her jaw-dropping appearance on the red carpet comes after Vanessa spoke exclusively to The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye about preparing for her upcoming role in Pieces Of A Woman.

The actress plays Martha, a Boston woman who loses her baby during a traumatic home birth, and explained that she spent time with a midwife and a paediatrician at the Whittington Hospital in North London in preparation.

She said: 'I couldn't have acted that, because I've never given birth myself,' she told me. 

'Just by pure chance an amazing woman allowed me to watch her give birth. I didn't know her but she was so generous and allowed me to be there when her boy was born.'

Vanessa added that she — along with on-screen husband Shia LaBeouf and director Kornel Mundruczo — wanted the birth scenes in the film to be as authentic as possible. 

'There's a 26-minute continuous shot of me, as Martha, giving birth, so I'd better know about contractions and everything else,' she added.
