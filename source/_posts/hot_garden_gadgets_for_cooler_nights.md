Social distancing rules have meant our gardens have never been so busy, being 'the' place to see friends and family safely. 

Now the first chilly hint of autumn has arrived, but there's no need to go inside3 — there are lots of clever new ways to stay warm and cosy outdoors, no matter the size of your garden and budget. 

From outdoor movie projectors, inflatable hot tubs and pizza ovens, to fireplaces and heated benches, TANITH CAREY looks at how to keep having fun al fresco in the months ahead. 

SUPER-CHIC FLAME CUBE TO SET YOUR GARDEN ALIGHT 

The neocube-o, £2,450 plus VAT, neolith.com 

For sheer sophistication — at a price — it would be hard to beat the clean lines of this outdoor fireplace. 

The gas flame sits in a chic glass cube perched on top of the stone base, which comes in 13 colours. 

It's easy to move around on four discreet rollers, and gives off a consistently comfortable heat. It also felt safer than some of the open fire pits I've tried.
