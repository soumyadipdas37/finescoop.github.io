Layers are key to transitioning summer clothes into fall. 

While there are no rules to wearing multiple garments at once, layering can appear sloppy and unflattering if done incorrectly. For guidance, we turn to stylish supermodel Hailey Bieber. 

Mrs. Bieber can layer like a pro! FEMAIL rounds up some of her best autumn looks to mimic and reveals the items you ned to do it.

Duster jacket: The versatile outer layer features a low hemline providing almost full body coverage from the elements and adds a touch of elegance to her casual getup

Changing temps will not stop the 23-year-old from flaunting her toned midriff in crop tops.

Hailey was spotted on the streets of Los Angeles in a white cotton tank and light- wash mid rise jeans.

She topped the classic everyday look with a green duster coat.

A duster jacket in a dark shade like Hailey's can offset garments in lighter summer colors.

All year long: As Hailey has proven on a number of occasions, t-shirts are seasonless

Boots are needed: Sure, she's showing a lot of leg for a cool day, but her shoes set the tone for wearing a t-shirt (sans pants) as a dress.

Blazer essential: Now that fall is fast approaching we don't want to give up our go-tos. The good news is, we don't have to! Just add the right outerlayer

Most of us live in jean shorts during summer months. 

And how could we not? From bathing suits to peasant tops and even dresses, they go with everything. Now that fall is fast approaching we don't want to give up our go-tos. The good news is, we don't have to! Think of your shorts as a skirt.

Last week, Hailey stepped out in shorts and a sports bra, topped by an oversize blazer, and looked like a boss babe.

Supersized blazers were seen on the runways and have become a must-have for all street style stars. The tailored garment has taken the place of the bomber jacket.

Throw on a few necklaces, sling a sleek handbag over your shoulder and slip into fall appropriate boots.
