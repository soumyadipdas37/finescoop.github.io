A PE teacher who is fitter at 43 then she was as an athlete in her 20s has shared the eight major life changes she made to live a healthier life, including reciting what she is grateful for before bed and moving her body at 'varying speeds' daily.  

Mother-of-two Belinda Norton, from the Gold Coast, Queensland, abandoned excessive cardio training for weights while also transforming her diet over the past two decades, losing 20 kilos in the process.

On September 25 the inspiring school teacher took to Instagram to share eight life-changing mottos that changed her 'body and mind'.

'I realised life was extremely short and I'm lucky I'll have 80 years of life. Currently I am over halfway and I have zero regrets,' she started.

Belinda has also realised that health cannot be bought so unless she's willing to put in the work, no one else can do it for her.

So instead of having a victim mentality and blaming people and situations around her, she owned up to everything she 'chose, chewed and swallowed' and all the times she decided to sit on the couch instead of moving her body. 

She said: 'Food is way more important than exercise and water is even more crucial for the skin and body to function'. 

While some people enjoy starting their day with a smoothie or green vegetable-packed health drink, Belinda steers clear. 

1. I realised life was extremely short and if I'm lucky I'll have 80 years of life. Currently I am over halfway and I have zero regrets.

2. Health cannot be bought so unless I do it no one else can for me. So I owned my choices with no more victim mentality as I chose the food I chewed and swallowed and I sat on the lounge.

3. Food is way more important than exercise and water even more crucial for the skin and body function.

4. Being stressed only takes good moments from our life; it steals our time and causes disease within the body.

5. Move your body with varying speed daily; lift weights regularly and always stretch.

6. Sleep soundly by stating two grateful moments as your head relaxes onto the pillow.

7. The sun will give you energy and the sunrise will provide positivity even on the harshest heartbreaks.

8. Be unapologetically you; be honest, give back as often as you can and never doubt your abilities. Anything is possible.

'We tend to grab a quick fix, especially juice or iced tea, however these are high in sugar and do not provide the body with its most simple requirement - clean water,' she said.

If you do dabble in the fruit juice department, ensure you're supplementing with water to flush the 'liquid pollutants' out of your system.  

When it comes to preparing meals the 43-year-old favours leafy green vegetables, lean protein and slow-release carbohydrates.

Despite believing food is more important than movement generally she does choose to move her body at 'varying speeds daily', whether that be by stretching or lifting weights. 

* MORNING TEA: Mixed berries and a cup of almond milk.

* MAIN MEAL: Barbecue chicken or tofu with raw broccoli and cauliflower with a splash of teriyaki seasoning and hemp seeds, cooked for two minutes in the microwave.

* AFTERNOON TEA: Raw roasted almonds, mini cucumbers and a small carrot.

* HYDRATION: Either water or coconut water.

Despite this she does choose to move her body at ' varying speeds daily ', whether that be to stretch or lift weights 

 'Start your morning cardio (walk, run, skip, bike) only 30 minutes before breakfast,' Belinda wrote on her website (pictured with her daughter)

Firstly, Belinda starts the day by doing 30 minutes of cardio.

'Start your morning cardio (walk, run, skip, bike) only 30 minutes before breakfast,' Belinda wrote on her website. 

She then returns home to have a hearty breakfast such as green tea poached pears with sesame hemp seeds; coconut yogurt and almond milk porridge or a fried egg with mushrooms and spinach.

Belinda allows herself one or two coffees per day, usually with almond or soy milk.

She believes that doing cardio fasted helps to create long, lean and toned muscles. 

High intensity interval training or HIIT is also invaluable for getting in shape, and the PE teacher said she will usually do a high intensity session three times per week at some point in the afternoon.

 Typically, this includes activities like hill sprints, body crawls with push ups and step ups on to a box or block (pictured in her 20s left and 40s right)

Belinda likes to do her high intensity training around 4.30pm or 5pm, when she has finished the working day before dinner. 

Once a week, Belinda said she'll do a heavy weights session - either with her own body weight or heavy dumbbells. 

This might include squats, lunges, curtsy lunges and bicep curls. 

She likes to mix up the sessions in order to target different areas of the body.

Belinda tries to spend as much time outdoors as possible - while protecting her skin with sunscreen - because the sun will 'give you energy' and 'sunrise provides positivity even on the harshest of heartbreaks' 

* Quick oats

* Hemp seeds (for salads and protein balls)

* Sunflower seeds

* Pumpkin seeds

* LSA (linseed, soy & almond meal mix)

* Rice bran syrup

* Almonds

* Peanut butter

* Cacao powder

* Coconut oil

'I never do heavy weights on heavy period days either,' Belinda posted on Instagram.

'On heavy days, sometimes I just rest and eat perfectly.'

She tries to plan her week ahead so there is no undue stress involved because stress itself 'takes good moments away from our lives' and steals our time. 

Before she goes to bed each night Belinda recites two grateful moments she experienced throughout the day, which she finds relaxes her.  

Her final eighth point was to 'be unapologetically you'; be honest, give back as often as you can and never doubt your abilities. Anything is possible.

'Remember to avoid the negative self talk. Find one thing daily about yourself that you can compliment yourself on... it's key to mental wellness and self confidence,' she said.
