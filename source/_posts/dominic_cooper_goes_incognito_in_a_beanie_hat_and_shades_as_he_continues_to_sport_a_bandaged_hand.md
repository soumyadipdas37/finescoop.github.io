He's one of Britain's most successful actors. 

Yet Dominic Cooper attempted to go incognito on Sunday as he headed out with his cap pulled down and a pair of shades. 

The Hollywood star's disguise proved futile, however, as he was stopped by passers-by as he headed out in London's Primrose Hill.

Dominic also caught the eye in a vibrant red jumper that he layered beneath a bomber jacket and teamed with jeans. 

The Marvel star finished off the look with a gold chain, cobalt beanie and shades.

Ouch: The Mamma Mia! star, 42, may have been given away by the distinctive bandage on his hand, which he has been sporting for a couple of weeks, but has yet to reveal why

The appearance comes after the Hollywood star enjoyed a rural Scottish getaway with girlfriend Gemma Chan and close friends Richard Madden and Lily James.

Richard and Gemma starred together in Eternals while Lily and Dominic co-starred in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.

The foursome posted several snaps of their rural getaway together to social media.

Dominic, Gemma and Richard decided to avoid the hustle and bustle of their respective homes in the city to stay in Blair Athol, a village in Perthshire known for its rustic stone buildings and scenic landscape.

Preacher star Dominic and Crazy Rich Asians actor Gemma live together in London, but decided to escape the city to meet up with Scots-born Madden, who had spent isolation in Los Angeles with actor Froy Gutierrez. 

Richard and Gemma have been long time friends and joined one another last year on the red carpet at the SAG awards.

During her trip to Scotland, Gemma explored the local farm life posing with lambs, while the boys made the most of their Land Rovers and even jumped on the bonnet of one for a socially distanced picture.

Richard said of the trip: 'Best time with my favourite people. Thank you Land Rover for the hot wheels.'

Referring to the song The Bonnie Banks of a Loch Lomond, Dominic added: 'You take the high road and I’ll take the low road and I’ll be in Scotland before you.' 

He and Gemma confirmed their relationship in September 2018 and she was previously in a long-term relationship with Jack Whitehall.

Dominic's most high-profile romance was with his Mamma Mia! co-star Amanda Seyfried, 34.
