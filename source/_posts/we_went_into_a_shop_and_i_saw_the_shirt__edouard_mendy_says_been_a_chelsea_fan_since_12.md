New Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has revealed his pride at signing for the club he has supported ever since buying a Blues shirt in a shop as a youngster.

The 28-year-old Senegal international joined the Premier League side on a five-year deal from French club Rennes this week.

And he revealed he has always 'adored' the west London giants after a trip to Brighton in which he donned a Blues top in a store for the first time as an excited 12-year-old.

‘Yes! I’ve been a Chelsea supporter since I was little. I adore this club,' Mendy told the club website. 

'When I was 12 I had the chance with a past club I played for to go to Brighton, and we watched a match. I thought English football was amazing.

'We went into a shop and I saw the Chelsea shirt, this was about 2003 when Ranieri was the manager, and I bought this shirt. So I’ve always liked this club.’ 

Boss Frank Lampard expects his new signing to increase competition for the No 1 spot with under-pressure stopper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Willy Caballero also battling for the position.

And Mendy admitted it will be a 'privilege' to wear Chelsea's colours for real as a member of Lampard's star-laden squad.  

'I’m very proud,’ Mendy added. 

Kepa Arrizabalaga has been under huge pressure and the signing of Mendy adds to that 

‘When a club like Chelsea is interested in you, it means you’ve done great work every weekend. 

'Everyone knows Chelsea are one of the biggest clubs in the world, and everyone would like to play for this team, but not everyone can. 

'To have a chance to wear this shirt and defend the club’s colours, it’s a privilege.’  

Chelsea were keen to bring in a keeper with greater presence to complement their existing options which helped the 6ft 5in Mendy stopper get nod over other options the Blues considered along with his reasonable price tag. 

And he will now be available for inclusion in Lampard’s squad to face West Brom on Saturday after completing his switch.
