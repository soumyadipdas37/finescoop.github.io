The brunette beauty styled her chocolate tresses in a natural 'do, and tucked them away in a topknot as she sat down for a drink.  

Jennifer recently revealed that her relationship with ex Geordie Shore star, Greg, who is the father to her son Daye, three, secretly ended during lockdown. 

She wrote: 'Greg and I decided to part ways amicably a couple months ago. 

'We remain friends and we both will continue to happily co parent Daye and would appreciate privacy during these times.'

Jennifer has been regularly sharing pictures of herself with Greg and Daye on her Instagram, with the last family picture appearing on July 12. It seems that the couple had already split at this point, but they remain close.

In 2018, Jennifer revealed that she thought Greg had proposed to her and was unimpressed by the gesture, before realising it was not an engagement ring.  

She told Loose Women at the time: 'I thought Greg had proposed to me on my birthday. He got a ring out, I’d just got back from work.

'I was too tired for it. I said "can we please do this another time, I’m tired". It was just a ring ‘for us’ though, not an engagement one.'
