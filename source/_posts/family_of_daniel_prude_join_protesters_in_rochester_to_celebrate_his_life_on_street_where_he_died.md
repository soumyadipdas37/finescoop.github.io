The family of Daniel Prude participated in a community celebration of his life in Rochester, New York, last night. 

His relatives, visiting from Chicago and Florida, took part in the demonstration in his memory on Jefferson Avenue, where he was arrested. 

Rochester, a city of 200,000 people on Lake Ontario, erupted with protests last week after the Prude family released body camera footage from the arrest.

The demonstration took place on Jefferson Avenue, where he was arrested after his brother phoned 911 about his erratic behaviour

It showed police putting a 'spit hood', designed to protect police from bodily fluids, over the 41-year-old black man's head after he complied with being handcuffed.

Prude, from Chicago, died after an encounter with police in March, but news of the incident didn’t come to light until September 2. 

It is now being investigated by the New York State Attorney General's Office. 

Protesters demanded justice for him for the ninth straight night in Rochester, and demonstrated peacefully on Thursday.

Prude, who had mental health issues, died after being restrained by police. His family wore tops with writing about black mental health to bring attention to the issue 

Officers had responded to a 911 call made by his brother, seeking help for Prude's erratic behaviour on March 23. 

Prude, who had mental health issues, was naked at the time of his arrest, and was handcuffed and pinned down to the pavement as officers restrained him.   

He lost consciousness and died a week later after he was taken off life support.

Mayor Lovely Warren has announced the suspension of seven officers involved in the arrest and promises reforms to the city's police department.  

A federal civil lawsuit filed from the Prude family against the City of Rochester alleges there was an internal cover-up, according to Rochester First.
