She was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Miriam Maisel in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

And Rachel Brosnahan kept things casual for this year's Emmy Awards as she dressed in her pajamas to watch the awards show from home amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The actress, 30, looked radiant as she posed for a series of snaps alongside her husband Jason Ralph and their pet pooches.

The TV star donned navy and purple pajamas and a pair of black slippers while she sipped on a martini to watch the show.

Rachel styled her brunette locks into loose waves for the evening as she struck a series of playful poses with her other half.

Alongside the post, the Change In The Air star wrote: 'Pajamas but make it fashion'. 

Rachel was nominated alongside Linda Cardellini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Issa Rae and Tracee Ellis Ross.

The award went to Catherine for her role in hit comedy Schitt's Creek, with all four of the show's main stars taking home gongs for their work. 

It comes after the announcement that Rachel will headline life-swap comedy The Switch for Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners.

Announcing the news on Instagram, she wrote: 'I’ve been trying not to spill the beans about this and can finally say...I can’t wait to (someday soon I hope!) get cracking on #TheSwitch. Also, look mum! Finally get to use that British accent!'

Rachel's mother Carol was born in the UK and her dad Earl is an American of Irish descent. She was born in Wisconsin and raised in Illinois.

The Switch will be an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Beth O'Leary.

Set in the UK, it's the story of what happens when a 29-year-old consultant in London swaps lives with her 79-year-old grandmother who lives in Yorkshire in the north of England.

The consultant finds herself plunged into the life of a small village where she walks dogs and participates in neighbourhood watch.

Her grandmother, meanwhile, has to adapt to a tiny flat, dating apps and starting up a social club for lonely Londoners.  

In an official news release from the studio, Rachel said she 'was utterly charmed and deeply moved' by the novel and added she 'can't wait' to share the story with everyone.' 

The actress first got noticed for her roles in The Blacklist and House of Cards.

But her career really took off with the Amazon Original Series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in which she plays a late 1950's New York housewife with a bent for stand-up comedy.
