West Ham swept aside both Charlton and any lingering frustration at their defeat by Newcastle as David Moyes' men marched on in the Carabao Cup.  

Sebastien Haller broke the deadlock after Andriy Yarmolenko timed his run to beat the offside trap before putting it on a plate for the striker. 

Haller was at it again, doubling the lead with a header from Robert Snodgrass' cross. And Felipe Anderson added a third, converting Manuel Lanzini's pass.
