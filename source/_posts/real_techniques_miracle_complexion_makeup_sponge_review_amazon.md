Created by making loving sisters Sam and Nic Chapman - otherwise known as YouTube's PIXIWOO - the Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Makeup Sponge is arguably one of the best beauty sponges on the market.

If you're already a devotee or want to see what all of the hype is about, we have some good news for you.

The Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Makeup Sponge Duo (Pack of 2) is now available for a budget-friendly £7.28 on Amazon – that's a saving of 27 per cent.

The Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Makeup Sponge boasts a dedicated fanbase on Amazon with over 19,500 reviews

Real Techniques' affordable super-soft and bright orange makeup sponge has become renowned for its makeup blending abilities (foundation, cream blusher, contour and concealer – you name it).

They're bigger than most blenders and feature a tapered pointy precision tip to target hard-to-reach areas like around the nose, rounded sides for effortless blending, and a flat edge for contouring.

When dampened, the sponge swells up to twice its original size. Not only will this give you more of a natural finish that you can build upon, but it prevents the sponge  soaking up excess foundation. It will help you get the best foundation finish of your life, trust us.

Don't just take our word for it. The Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Makeup Sponge boasts a dedicated fanbase on Amazon with over 19,500 reviews and a near-perfect star rating of 4.6 out of 5.

Shoppers love the quality you get for the low price, and many stated that the Real Techniques orange makeup sponge is better than the cult-favourite BeautyBlender that costs twice the price.

According to one review on Amazon, the 'finish you can achieve with these sponges is so much nicer than makeup applied with a brush or fingers'.

'The Real Techniques Sponges are by far the best makeup sponges I've used,' wrote another reviewer. 'I prefer to use sponges over brushes as I feel they give your foundation a more 'airbrushed' finish.'

Another customer stated that it's their' favourite brand of cosmetic sponges' and 'superior to the Beautyblender in as they have a flat side'.

Reusable and easily washable with baby shampoo or fragrance-free soap, these sponges from Real Techniques aren't to be sniffed at as they provide a professional finish with little fuss.
