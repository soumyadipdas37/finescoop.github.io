An Australian bakery has launched a limited-edition cheeseburger pie in stores across the country.

Café chain Banjo's Bakery, which has outlets in Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, announced the new flavour in an Instagram post, calling it 'the perfect Saturday treat'.

The filling is made from pickles and onions sandwiched between layers of Australian beef and lashings of melted cheese, tomato sauce and mustard, all encased in a flaky layer of shortcrust pastry.

The pie – which is part of the bakery's signature range - is available for $6.95 in stores nationwide for a 'limited time only', so you'd better move fast.

Photos drew delighted responses after they were shared on social media, with comments including 'looks awesome', 'wow I need to try this' and 'sounds good'.

'Oh my God, this is Maccas in a pie,' one woman said.

'Thought I'd try one of these at Banjo's Lindisfarne yesterday. A unique experience for sure! Somehow I don't think it'll be my last,' said a second.

The unique treat has even caught the attention of pie lovers overseas. 

'You need to open stores in the USA! Especially Las Vegas, Nevada! This looks so good,' one man wrote on Banjo's Instagram account.

An iconic name in Australia, Banjo's is known for its wide range of decadent pies and pastries, with flavours like cauliflower cheese, curried chicken, beef, bacon and cheese and scallop all available nationwide.

There's also a 'big brekkie' pie, packed with bacon, eggs, tomato and baked beans, and a vegetarian pie filled with nine different veggies in a light curry sauce.

Other options include a croissant stuffed with eggs benedict, a variety of sausage rolls and a spinach and mushroom frittata inside toasted sourdough bread.
