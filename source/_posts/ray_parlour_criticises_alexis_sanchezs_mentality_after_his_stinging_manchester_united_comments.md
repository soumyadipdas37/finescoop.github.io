Arsenal legend Ray Parlour has slammed Alexis Sanchez after the forward revealed he wanted to leave Manchester United after his first training session. 

On Thursday Sanchez posted a video on Instagram explaining what went wrong during his spell as a United player, drawing strong criticism from Parlour.

The Chilean joined the club from Arsenal in January 2018 in a deal which saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan move in the opposite direction, but Sanchez was only able to score five goals in 45 appearances before spending the 2019-20 season on loan at Inter Milan.



The 31-year-old completed a permanent move to the San Siro last month and has since taken to social media to set the record straight.

'I want to tell you about my period at United, about many things that were said and that made me look bad,' said Sanchez.

'I got the opportunity to go to United and it seemed tempting to me. It was something nice for me, because, when I was a kid, I liked that club a lot.

'I ended up signing without much information about what was happening in the move. The first days that I was with my colleagues, sometimes there are things that you do not realise until you arrive.

Sanchez released a video on Thursday in which he revealed he considered quitting United 

'The first training I had I realised many things. I came home and I told my representative: 'Can't the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?'

'They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It (the contract) had already been signed.' 

Now Parlour has had his say on Sanchez's Instagram video. He told talkSPORT: 'I can't believe you want to leave a club after one training session. How does that work?!

'You've got to give yourself a chance; it's new surroundings and a different way of training than at Arsenal.

'And it shouldn't come down to wages, but he was on £560,000-a-week and he wants to leave straight away?! You've got to work hard.'

Sanchez suggests he became a scapegoat at United due to a run of disappointing results

Parlour added: 'How can you say, as a player, when you turn up to a club you want to leave the next day?

'That's not right. That mentality should not be in a footballer.

'You should say, "it's Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I've got to fight for my position and make sure I try to perform like I did at Arsenal".'

'It might be a different style of football, it might not suit him, but you've got to try and win the fans over, the players over – everybody over. And that is what he didn't do.'
