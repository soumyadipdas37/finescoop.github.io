Her 2018 horror film The Lie is coming to streaming service Amazon next week.

Seeking publicity: Her 2018 horror film The Lie is coming to streaming service Amazon next week. And on Wednesday, Joey King got all dolled up for a remote press day for the movie

King paired her figure-hugging ensemble with white peep toe heels and a small white purse.

Her long brown hair was styled with a center parting and fell loose around her shoulders.

She made the independent feature in early 2018 in Toronto where it screened for the first time later that same year at the city's International Film Festival.

In The Lie, King plays the teen daughter of  Peter Sarsgaard and Mireille Enos who confesses to her parents that she's killed her best friend.

The parents then take increasingly desperate measures to cover up what their daughter has done while at the same time coming to realize just what she is capable of.

The film was written and directed by Canadian filmmaker Veea Sud, who created the TV series The Killing in which Enos starred.

Amazon Prime Video acquired the rights to the Blumhouse production as part of a deal for eight titles being made available on the platform during October.

It's a busy time for the actress who, it was announced earlier this week, that she is partnering with director McG to executive produce and star in an adaptation of the dystopian fantasy novel Uglies.

The movie will be made for Netflix, for which King starred in The Kissing Booth films, Deadline.com reported.

Uglies will be McG's fourth film for the streaming service after The Babysitter, Rim of the World and The Babysitter: Killer Queen.

The story based on Scott Westerfeld's 2005 novel takes place in a future world where everyone is forced to undergo surgery at 16 to conform to  an ideal standard of beauty. 

King will play protagonist Tally Youngblood who rebels against the enforced conformity along with her friends.
