It comes after Zayn broke his social media silence in July, one week after fans slammed him for failing to acknowledge the 10th anniversary of One Direction. 

The singer took to Instagram to post a teary-eyed selfie of him but left no caption causing his followers to wonder what was making him so emotional.  

It was the first time in five months Zayn uploaded a picture of himself and fans were delighted to see the father-to-be once more.

A third chimed: 'DON’T GO THAT LONG AGAIN PLEASE'.

A fourth fan added: 'WE MISS YOU ZAYN', while a fifth queried: 'Am I missing something? Why the crying?'.

Another follower commented: 'Where were you ZAYNNNN'. 

It came after One Direction fans vented their disappointment after Zayn did not acknowledge the band's 10th anniversary. 

The popular boy band formed on the X Factor in 2010 and other members Harry Styles, 26, Liam Payne, 26, Louis Tomlinson, 28, and Niall Horan, 26, each posted about the special day.

But Zayn who left the band in 2015 after struggling with stress, did not share anything on social media. 

Many fans who were hoping to see the former band member post a heartfelt message were left disappointed.

They begged the expecting father to say something, with many sharing memes about staying up to see if he made reference to the anniversary.

One fan said: 'Zayn, just a little 'thank you' would mean a lot to us please.'  

Another wrote: 'Zayn... say something... please.'

Zayn's departure from the band in 2015 appeared acrimonious, despite the Bradford-born star denying any rift with the remaining members.

The other four continued briefly but announced they would be taking a hiatus later that year. 

Each of the other four members posted heartfelt tributes to each other and their fans on the emotional day. 

And Simon Cowell, who formed the band, shared a sweet message on Twitter. 

He wrote: 'Today is a very special day. I was lucky enough to meet five guys. Who were so much fun. So talented. It feels like 10 minutes ago. And you made it happen.'
