Neymar and Alvaro Gonzalez have continued their war of words on social media after the PSG star accused his rival of racism during the French giant's feisty clash with Marseille. 

OM ran out 1-0 winners in a heated derby that saw five players sent off while 12 others were given yellow cards after a mass brawl broke out during the game at the Parc des Princes.

And Neymar was sent off after VAR found that he had thrown a punch at Gonzalez, before the Brazilian insisted that the Marseille defender was racially abusive towards him.

Neymar and Alvaro Gonzalez have continued their war of words on social media on Monday

The Brazilian was one of five players sent off in a feisty derby between PSG and Marseille 

The 28-year-old alleges that Gonzalez called him a 'monkey motherf*****', which infuriated the £208m star and resulted in him throwing a punch at his rival. 

The Spaniard responded to the allegation on social media, labelling Neymar a 'bad loser' before the Brazilian responded to Gonzalez's denial of the allegation. 

'There is no place for racism... Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field. Incredible 3 points today. Allez l'OM. Thanks family,' Gonzalez tweeted alongside a picture of himself with his team-mates.

Neymar protested after his dismissal, alleging that Gonzalez had racially abused him

He was caught on camera throwing a punch at the Spanish defender during the game 

'You are not a man to assume your mistake, losing is part of the sport. Now insulting and bringing racism into our lives no, I don't agree,' Neymar responded on Twitter.

'I DON'T RESPECT YOU! YOU HAVE NO CHARACTER! Assume what you say mermon ... be a MAN RAPÁ! RACIST'.
