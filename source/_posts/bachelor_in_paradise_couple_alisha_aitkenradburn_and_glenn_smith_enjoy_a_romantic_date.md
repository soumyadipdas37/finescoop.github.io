A taste of what's to come! Bachelor In Paradise's Alisha Aitken-Radburn and Glenn Smith are still going strong after find love on the Channel Ten series. The pair looked absolutely smitten as they enjoyed a romantic brunch date at a winery in Perth last Friday

They acted like lovestruck teenagers, flirting and giggling away in the sunshine.

Alisha was dressed to impress for the date, showing off her slender figure in a unique white ensemble consisting of a pair of tiny shorts and a crochet apron-style top.

She boosted her height with tan strappy stilettos and let her outfit do the talking by wearing no accessories.

Happy! They acted like lovestruck teenagers, flirting and giggling away in the sunshine

Meanwhile, Glenn looked casual cool in a pair of black denim jeans and a short-sleeved blue denim shirt.

Alisha and Bill met on this season's Bachelor In Paradise.  

Last month, Alisha revealed how she and Glenn kept their romance under wraps before the hit show aired.

Penning a lengthy post on Instagram the blonde bombshell said that she and Glenn, 'got lucky' that they could keep things on the down low.

Alisha said that it wasn't just because they tried hard to keep things a secret, but said it's because a lot of people didn't recognise Glenn from his season of The Bachelorette. 

'Lots of messages about how we stayed ''hidden'' but have clearly done a bunch of stuff,' Alisha said.

'I guess we just got lucky, @glennsmith87 wasn't SUPER recognisable from his season of Bachelorette (sorry babe) and you may or may not be surprised how fast people forget old cast of shows once new ones are airing.'

She went on to say that most people who recognised her didn't 'put two and two together' that she was dating a fellow reality star.

'That doesn't mean we weren't nervous, we were nervous literally all the time but we also couldn't resist spending a full day drinking cocktails on a daybed at Finns (sorry Warner Brothers).'

Finns is a beach club in Bali. The pair holidayed there together in February. 

Happy ending! Alisha and Bill met on this season's Bachelor In Paradise
