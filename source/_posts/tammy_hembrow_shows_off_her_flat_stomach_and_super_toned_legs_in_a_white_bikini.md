She recently revealed she works out an impressive three to five times a week.

And Tammy Hembrow showed off the fruits of her labour in an Instagram photo on Tuesday.

The 26-year-old flaunted her extraordinary abs and toned legs in yet another skimpy bikini, this time in revealing white.

The Instagram sensation pulled the straps down from around her neck and tied them around her back to turn it in to a strapless suit.

The blonde bombshell also flaunted her golden tan as she continued to soak up the Queensland sun.  

Tammy balances raising her children, son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four, with her fitness empire.

She told Daily Mail Australia earlier this year that she aims to fit in the gym three to five times a week.

'As long as I go at least three times a week, then I'm good. If I don't have time to go at least three times, then it just stresses me out,' Tammy said.

'I work out to keep my sanity, but between three and five workouts is usually what I do.'

Tammy follows a routine of HIIT (high-intensity interval training), weights, resistance training involving booty bands, ab circuits and boxing.

The entrepreneur got fans' attention when she announced on Instagram that she was going vegan for 2020.

But like others who make the switch, she admitted that it's been quite challenging.

'I was trying [vegan]. I lasted a little while but now fish is back in my diet,' she said.

'I don't really eat chicken or meat, it's mainly fish and vegetables. Hopefully I can go fully plant-based.'
