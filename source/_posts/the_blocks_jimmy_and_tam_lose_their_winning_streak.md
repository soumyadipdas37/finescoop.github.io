Jimmy and Tam have been the clear frontrunners on The Block up until this point, impressing all three judges and taking top spot in a series of room reveals.

However their winning streak came to an end on Sunday night's episode, scoring just 21-and-a-half points, the lowest for their master bedroom and walk-in robe.

Judge Shaynna Blaze did not hold back when critiquing their 'tiny' walk-in robe, branding it a 'disaster'. 

'It's a disaster!' The Block's Jimmy and Tam lost their winning streak as the judges, including Shaynna Blaze (pictured), slammed their 'tiny walk-in robe' and issued the LOWEST score

Jimmy and Tam began on a high note, presenting a gorgeous 1950's master bedroom with pink and yellow tones.  

Judge Neale Whitaker said the couple had 'not disappointed' or let him down yet, while fellow judge Darren Palmer said they 'have that special thing' about styling that you simply cannot teach.

However, the praise came crashing down, when all three judges walked through an empty space that was to be the ensuite, before getting to the walk-in robe.

Criticism: However, the praise came crashing down, when all three judges walked through an empty space that was to be the ensuite, before getting to the walk-in robe (pictured) 

'I'd like to know why they made it so small, it's tiny,' Shaynna said of the walk-in robe. 'I'm sorry, this is a disaster!' 

Darren added: 'I've got to say, honestly, that bedroom is one of the most impressive bedrooms that I think I've seen on The Block thus far, and this walk-in robe is one of the most disappointing.' 

He also found it bizarre that the couple designed the space so that the ensuite leads onto the walk-in robe, and not the other way around.  

Not impressed: 'I'd like to know why they made it so small, it's tiny,' Shaynna said of the walk-in robe. 'I'm sorry, this is a disaster!'

Not their usual best: Jimmy and Tam (pictured) had been on a winning streak on the show, up until that point 

For Harry and Tash, Darren praised their 1920's master bedroom's vaulted ceilings that offered 'grandeur', while Shaynna said the room 'does everything the buyer would want'.    

'They've got that nod to the period right in this room and I feel like the modern elements are not clashing,' Shaynna added. 

All judges agreed their walk-in robe was glamorous, however they would have loved greater attention to detail with Shaynna unable to reach the wardrobe hangers.

Winners: Harry and Tash (pictured) won the room reveal for the week with 25-and-a-half points

Sarah and George's 1940's master bedroom started off on a positive note, with Shaynna describing their ceiling panel as 'divine' and a 'dream come true'.

However, Neale was particularly vocal about their dominant and overwhelming wall mural that he had 'seen many, many times before'. 

All three judges said the walk-in robe offered functionality but lacked glamour.

Not bad: Sarah and George (pictured) placed fourth on 23 points 

'There's no romance here, there's no glamour. I find this really ugly,' Neale said. 

Daniel and Jade's 1930's master bedroom was a favourite of the judges, with Shaynna loving the 'Hollywood' feel and Neale the 'contemporary colour palette'.  

Darren was in awe of the finish on the doors in their walk-in robe, while Shaynna said she would have liked more hanging space.

Impressive: Daniel and Jade (pictured) tied second on 25 points with Luke and Jasmin 

Luke and Jasmin's 1910 master bedroom saw all three judges gasp when they entered the space.

Shaynna loved the 'stunning' bay window, wall panelling and white on white palette.

Neale added that they have 'found their style' - a beautiful mix of vintage and contemporary.

Space issues: However, the lack of hanging space in their walk-in robe (pictured) was also mentioned by the judges 

Second: Luke and Jasmin (pictured) tied second with Daniel and Jade on 25 points 

'I feel like I've just landed at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore at the turn of the last century,' he quipped.

However, the lack of hanging space in their walk-in robe was also mentioned by the judges.   

Harry and Tash won the room reveal for the week with 25-and-a-half points, followed by Daniel and Jade, and Luke and Jasmin on 25, Sarah and George on 23, and Jimmy and Tam on 21-and-a-half.
