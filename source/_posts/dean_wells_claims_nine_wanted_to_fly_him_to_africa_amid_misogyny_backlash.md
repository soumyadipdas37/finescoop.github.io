Former Married At First Sight contestant Dean Wells has reflected on the backlash he received for being portrayed as a 'sexist misogynist' in 2018.



Dean claimed that before his controversial promotional trailer aired, Channel Nine warned the reality TV star to 'be prepared' for negative reactions.

The 42-year-old, who was labelled the 'most hated man in the country', claims Nine offered to relocate Dean to another country at the height of his criticism.

In a new episode on his YouTube show Dangerous Ideas, Dean hit back at being labelled a 'misogynist' in early trailers.

The Sydneysider was portrayed as a domineering chauvinist who 'wants to be loved and honoured and obeyed'. 

He claimed that he never said the word 'obey' used in his promotional trailer for MAFS, and that most of the clip used franken-biting techniques to piece together numerous lines for dramatic effect.

'They wanted me to go to Africa': Dean said at one point Nine wanted to relocate the star overseas temporarily to build communities without access to the internet

Dean said at one point Nine were concerned for his mental health and wanted to relocate the star overseas temporarily.

'They wanted me to go to Africa,' Dean claimed, laughing along with former MAFS wife Tracey Jewel, who backed up Dean's claims.

Dean claimed Nine suggested he fly out of the country for a few weeks to help build communities without internet access as 's**t goes down'.

He claims to have declined the alleged offer at the time.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Nine for comment.

In a previous YouTube video in 2019, Dean described how his life spiraled after the show began airing, 

He said: 'The next thing you know, I was cast as the villain, as a sexist, misogynist violent a***hole, which was terrible because, first of all, I would never be violent towards a woman in any way.' 

Dean was later painted as the show's 'villain' after plotting a so-called 'affair' with co-star Davina Rankin, despite being paired with Tracey.
