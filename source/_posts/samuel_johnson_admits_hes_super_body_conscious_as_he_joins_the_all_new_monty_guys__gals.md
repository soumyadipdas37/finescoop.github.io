Samuel Johnson has joined the cast of The All New Monty: Guys And Gals. 

And although he won Dancing With the Stars last year, the actor admitted on Sunday's episode of the charity special that he was not looking forward to the sexy moves he has to pull off for the strip show. 

The 42-year-old confessed ahead of rehearsals that he suffers from body issues and lacks confidence in that department. 

Oh no! Samuel Johnson (pictured) joined the cast of The All New Monty: Guys And Gals. The actor admitted on Sunday's episode of the charity special that he was not looking forward to the sexy moves he has to pull off for the strip show

The Secret Life of Us actor said: 'I'm super body conscious. And I feel like a gawky actor. I'm a lights off guy!' 

He went on: 'This will be the hardest thing I've ever done. And I was on a unicycle, for 100 days in a row. Oh, man! It makes me anxious!' 

Samuel added that he wasn't even sure he was much of a dancer, clothes on or off.

Scared: When asked how he felt about stripping naked, Samuel said he was 'a lot less secure' than the other men in the cast

'As far as doing all the strippy stuff, that's not what I do. I'll get in there and just be the unco 40-year-old white guy!' 

When asked how he felt about stripping naked, Samuel said he was 'a lot less secure' than the other men in the cast. 

However he was philosophical about it, and felt it was more important to raise awareness for men's cancers via the show than it was to consider his own discomfort. 

Although he won Dancing With the Stars last year (pictured), he insisted: 'As far as doing all the strippy stuff, that's not what I do. I'll get in there and just be the unco 40-year-old white guy!'

'It's not about my feelings. It's about awareness, it's about encouraging people and it's about just being part of the team,' he declared. 

One he began rehearsals, the Molly star started to get a lot more comfortable.   

'I am having a lot more fun than I thought I would. I thought it would basically be confronting, but it's a good group,' he said. 

Raising awareness for cancer is close to Sam's heart, as he currently runs the Love Your Sister charity, after losing his sister Connie to breast cancer in 2017. 

In it! One he began rehearsals, the Molly star got comfortable. 'I am having a lot more fun than I thought I would. I thought it would basically be confronting, but it's a good group,' he said
