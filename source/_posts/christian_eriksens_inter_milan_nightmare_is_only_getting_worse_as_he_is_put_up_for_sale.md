Christian Eriksen has sensationally been placed on the transfer list by Inter Milan just a matter of months after his move to Italy. For an offer of around £35million, the Serie A giants would be willing to allow the playmaker to leave.

The preferred 3-5-2 formation of Antonio Conte has often forced Eriksen to settle for a spot on the sidelines, and the enigmatic Italian coach is certain he can lead the club back to glory should they grant him his wishes this summer.

The new-look Inter will be formed entirely around his philosophy and blueprint for the future, both of which no longer feature the expensive outcast Eriksen. Quite simply, Conte is eager for the error to be solved over the coming weeks.

Inter viewed their original swoop as a solid market opportunity. This viewpoint has not been shared by Conte, however, who is open to cutting his losses in the event of an acceptable offer. 

Eriksen's horror spell since heading to Milan has culminated in a lockdown nightmare. He has been unable to settle into his new surroundings, and the fact that Italy has been ravaged by coronavirus has only fuelled the player's dilemma.  

The pandemic prevented him from finding a house in north Italy, meaning the club's training complex became his makeshift home. A stop from the police then added to the misery. Eriksen had been on his way to visit a supermarket, and was promptly given a stern ticking off for breaking the stay-at-home guidelines in place.

The pause to football also prevented Eriksen from being able to effectively retain his fitness levels. He outlined his unorthodox training regime during the sport's lengthy hiatus: racing around the facility's car park.  

His wish to bounce back and defy critics has meant the fact he wants to stay at the club is no secret. Eriksen had even hoped to be considered an important part of the new project at Inter next season. Despite falling behind Roberto Gagliardini in the pecking order, the 28-year-old remains determined to lead from the front.

Conte has other ideas. He is keen to bring in Chelsea stalwart N'Golo Kante and has patched up his differences with club president Steven Zhang. The two shared a far from perfect relationship towards the end of last season, but Conte has been afforded complete freedom over Inter's movements in the market.

It has been highlighted by Conte previously that his team will always be considered more important than any individuals, and Eriksen is likely to fall victim to this mantra over the coming weeks.

The outcast has been unable to establish himself in Milan and Inter believe offloading him now will prevent a potential tactical dilemma next season. According to Sportmediaset, Eriksen will be shipped out should the club's valuation be met. Conte's insistence on adopting his 3-5-2 system will certainly keep the midfielder on the sidelines in the event he is unable to broker a move.

Having players who are capable and willing to race up and down at both ends of the field is crucial for Conte's chosen set-up. The manager views Eriksen as being solely a creative hub, and believes he will not be able to adapt and play further forward.

But despite being open to a sale, Inter are determined to receive a good fee for the 28-year-old

His stubborn nature means that Eriksen is just one of a number of players that Inter will openly field offers for. Romelu Lukaku, Nicolo Barella and Alessandro Bastoni are believed to be the 'untouchable' members of Conte's ranks, and the boss has been reassured that all three will stay. 

But Inter are determined to receive an acceptable figure for Eriksen. Sportmediaset have claimed that the club may even include the player in their own deals to help reinforce Conte's squad. The 51-year-old has targeted unwanted Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal and has appealed to the combative star to accept the terms offered to him. 

The Chilean is thought to believe that Conte's time at Inter may be limited, but has been on the club's shortlist from as early as January. 

Giuseppe Marotta brought in Eriksen in the winter window instead of Vidal, a decision which ultimately appears set to backfire.
