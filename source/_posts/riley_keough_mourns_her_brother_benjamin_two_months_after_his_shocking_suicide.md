Riley Keough has marked two months since her younger brother Benjamin Storm tragically died by suicide.

On Instagram on Monday the 31-year-old actress shared a memory with her sibling which showed the duo goofing around and pulling faces while enjoying some family time together. 

'Two months without you. I would give anything for 1 more minute with you little brother' Riley captioned the image. 

'1 more minute': Riley Keough has marked two months since her younger brother Benjamin Storm tragically died by suicide

Benjamin Keough, 27, died July 12 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Weeks after his sudden death Riley got a tattoo tribute to her late brother with the name 'Benjamin Storm' inked on her collarbone.

Riley shared a picture of her tattoo on Instagram Stories and also posted a snap of Benjamin's inking of her name, on his own collarbone.

It came after Riley previously shared a slideshow of images of the pair - who are both the children of Lisa Marie Presley and Danny Keough - on Instagram, and said she 'can't believe' her sibling is gone. 

She wrote alongside the pictures: 'Mornings are the hardest. I forget you're gone. I can't cry because of the fear that I will never stop. A pain that's new to me.

'You. There are no words for you. Angel is the closest I could think of. Pure light. Baby brother. Best friend. Wild man. Intellectual. Witness to my life. Twin soul. Protector.

'Too sensitive for this harsh world. I hope you give me strength to endure the giant hole you've left in my heart. I hope you give me the strength to eat. I hope you're cradled in love. I hope you feel my love. I hope you feel god. You are god. 

'I can't believe you've left me. Not you sweet Ben Ben. Anyone but you. I guess this is true heartbreak. I hope we meet again. (sic)'

Benjamin's passing was officially ruled a suicide, with the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner confirming he died from a self-inflicted 'intraoral shotgun wound'. 

Following Benjamin's death, a spokesperson for Lisa Marie - who has 11-year-old twins Finley and Harper with her fourth husband Michael Lockwood - said: 'She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11 year old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.'
