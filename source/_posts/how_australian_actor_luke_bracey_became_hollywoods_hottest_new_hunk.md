It has been eleven years since he made his soap debut with the recurring role of Trey Palmer in the long-running series, Home and Away.

And Luke Bracey, 31, is undoubtedly on the precipice of massive Hollywood stardom thanks to his dashing good looks and ability to hold his own against some of the industry's leading names.

Already having starred alongside the likes of Selena Gomez, Dwayne Johnson and Reese Witherspoon, the Australian actor is set to add to his envy-inducing acting credentials with his new flick Holidate, alongside Emma Roberts.

With initial plans to become a professional rugby player or pursue a career in construction, a chance opportunity to audition for Home and Away changed the course of his life.

Following his stint on the Australian soap, the budding star - who hails from Freshwater, New South Wales - was offered an exciting role in the movie Monte Carlo alongside Selena Gomez and Leighton Meester.

The then 20-year-old took the exciting movie offer as an initiative to pack up his belongings and relocate to Hollywood.

Luke has since been working steadily in Los Angeles with roles in popular movies such as 2013's G.I. Joe: Retaliation and 2016's Oscar-winning, Hacksaw Ridge.

The Ralph Lauren model's fanbase certainly intensified this year after he starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Emmy-nominated series, Little Fires Everywhere.

He is set to end the year on a high thanks to his new rom-com Holidate, which released its trailer on Tuesday.

Pairing up with American Horror Story actress Emma, the movie will see the two play acquaintances who hatch up a plan to be each other's platonic dates for every holiday.

The movie will hit Netflix on October 28.

Meanwhile, Luke's mother will certainly be having a tough time with his new status as Hollywood's go-to leading man.

Speaking previously to Interview Magazine, Luke explained she hasn't been too keen with his reputation as a sex symbol.

'My poor mother. Every time I get a job she asks, "Am I gonna have to watch you kiss someone again in this one?" and I say, "You're probably gonna have to watch me kiss someone in most of them,"' he said.

Meanwhile, with his chiselled good looks, Luke is undoubtedly off the market.

The star has been in a relationship with stunning Mexican actress, Eiza González, since November last year.

Despite his dazzling new Hollywood stardom and gorgeous movie-star girlfriend, Luke is very much an Aussie boy at heart.

He is a keen surfer who regularly hits the waves when he makes the long journey home.
