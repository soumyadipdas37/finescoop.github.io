Jude Bellingham proved during his first training session with the Under 21s that England were right to promote him by four age groups.

The midfielder jumped from the Under 17s after Borussia Dortmund made him the most expensive 17-year-old in history by signing him from Birmingham for £25million.

Bellingham made his mark at St George's Park on Monday and is likely to be handed a debut in Friday's European Championship qualifier in Kosovo.

17-year-old Jude Bellingham has impressed in training with the England Under-21 squad

'When we got on the pitch, you couldn't tell he wasn't an Under 21 player,' said manager Aidy Boothroyd.

'He's not thinking he's arrived. He's got work to do to be the best he can be, which I always think is refreshing from young players. He's very level-headed, as Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood are.

'That's why they are where they are. Humility is a trait of successful people. He's got it in abundance. My first impression is that he is a very impressive young man on and off the pitch.'

Bellingham was promoted by four age groups after signing for Borussia Dortmund for £25m

Bellingham was dropped off by his parents and immediately endeared himself to the backroom team.

'It's always a good gauge, how players deal with the staff,' Boothroyd added.

'He's been excellent, just a very positive, genuine young guy who everybody likes. Jude is in exactly the right place right now.

'I looked at Jude in the early part of last season. He's done so well that he's managed to get himself a move and hopefully he can carry that on.'

Under-21s boss Aidy Boothroyd admitted Bellingham has made a very good first impression

Boothroyd has kept faith with many of the players who have served him well in the past and regularly checked in with them over the last 10 months.

'We've had plenty of phone calls and FaceTime,' he said.

'It's been a tough time and I'm just delighted to be coming out of it and seeing a few faces.'

Brighton wing back Tariq Lamptey has been added to the squad after Crystal Palace winger Eberechi Eze withdrew.
