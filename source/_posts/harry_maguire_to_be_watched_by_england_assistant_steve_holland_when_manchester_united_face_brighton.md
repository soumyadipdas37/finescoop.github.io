England manager Gareth Southgate will dispatch No 2 Steve Holland to check on Harry Maguire on Saturday ahead of deciding whether to hand the defender an international recall.

Having initially been selected in the previous England squad to face Iceland and Denmark earlier this month, central defender Maguire was booted out of the party just hours later after being found guilty on three operate offences following an altercation with Greek police during a post-season holiday to Mykonos.

Maguire has since successfully appealed for a re-trial which United insist effectively makes him an innocent man until the new court case is concluded.

Southgate is faced with a dilemma regarding Maguire’s selection for next month's matches against Wales, Belgium and Denmark given the circumstances, though the England boss said earlier this month that he would consider picking the former Leicester man.

And Holland is due to be at the Amex Stadium on Saturday afternoon to watch Maguire take on Brighton before he and Southgate decide whether to select the Manchester United defender.

The game will also provide Holland an opportunity to monitor young United striker Mason Greenwood, whose place in the squad is under huge doubt after he was sent home from Iceland in disgrace for inviting two women back to the team hotel.

Greenwood and Manchester City midfielder Foden - who were both in the squad for the first time - were banished back to England for the error in judgement; Southgate critical of the pair’s behaviour in the aftermath.

Whether to re-select the fledgling duo will be one of the key decisions facing Southgate ahead of Thursday’s announcement - but it is understood the pair will not be picked for the seniors.

Southgate will watch Sheffield United’s game against Leeds on Sunday before going to Manchester City versus Leicester.
