The White House called Michael Cohen's memoir about working for President Donald Trump 'fan fiction' and said the lawyer and fixer was 'sad and desperate.' 

'He readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales,' White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement to the Associated Press. 'It's unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump.'

Cohen's book 'Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump' includes a number of salacious anecdotes, casting Trump as racist, sexist and pro-Russian, according to the Washington Post, which obtained an advance copy of it. 

The White House called Michael Cohen 'sad and desperate' and said his forthcoming memoir 'Disloyal' amounted to 'fan fiction'

Cohen portrayed President Donald Trump (pictured) as racist, sexist and pro-Russian in his new book 'Disloyal' 

In Michael Cohen's memoir 'Disloyal,' set to hit shelves Tuesday, the shamed attorney paints Trump as ‘a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man' 

Cohen writes that he was 'one of Trump's bad guys,' while calling Trump - who he had previously defended to the hilt - 'a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.'

He wrote that during the 2016 campaign, Trump allegedly said that minorities were 'not my people' and that the president also supposedly claimed he would 'never get the Hispanic vote,' because, 'Like the blacks, they're too stupid to vote for Trump.' 

The disbarred lawyer detailed Trump's 'hatred and contempt' of Obama, too.

Cohen revealed that at some point in time, Trump allegedly hired a 'Faux-Bama' to star in a video, in which Trump 'ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him,' CNN reported Cohen as having written. 

The news organization, which also obtained a copy of the memoir, said that the actor who played Faux-Bama was not named and there's no hint of when or why the video was filmed.  

But, the book does include a color picture in which Trump can be seen sitting behind a desk opposite a besuited black man with greying hair and an American flag pin on his lapel. 

One of the books on Trump's desk reads 'Obama.'   

Over the years, Trump has been criticized for spreading 'birther' statements, which insinuated that Obama was unqualified to be president because he might not have been born in the US - an untrue theory. 

Among Cohen's book's claims was that Trump said the only reason why Obama had been admitted to Columbia University for undergrad and then Harvard Law School was because of 'f---ing affirmative action.'

Cohen also wrote that Trump's 'low opinion of all black folks' included him allegedly saying: 'Tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a s---hole. They are all complete f---ing toilets.' 

According to Cohen, Trump used the 's**thole' phrase again, when talking about South African President Nelson Mandela. 

When Mandela died in 2013, Cohen wrote that Trump didn't think Mandela 'was a real leader — not the kind he respected'.

Cohen claimed that Trump said 'Mandela f---ed the whole country up. Now it's a s**thole. F**k Mandela. He was no leader.'  

Mandela was a key figure in ending apartheid in South Africa, a practice which divided the country along racial lines. 

Cohen also wrote that the president made 'overt and covert attempts to get Russia to interfere in the 2016 election', and said the he admired Vladimir Putin because he has the 'b**s' to run Russia like it's his personal business.

Cohen details Trump's apparent affinity for Russia leader Putin, insisting the cause of his affections is far more straightforward than many would assume: simply put, money.

Trump loved Putin, Cohen wrote, because of his ability to 'to take over an entire nation and run it like it was his personal company — like the Trump Organization, in fact.' 

But he added that Trump's campaign had been 'far too chaotic and incompetent to actually conspire with the Russian government.' 

 Cohen also wrote taht the president is said to have told aides his supporters would think it's cool he 'slept with a porn star' after Stormy Daniels' claims of an extramarital affair with Trump and 'forcibly kissed women in his office', the book alleges.  

Cohen also writes of Trump leering at Cohen's then-15-year-old daughter Samantha at Trump's New Jersey golf club in 2012. He is said to have inadvertently commented to Cohen on his daughter: 'Look at that piece of a***. I would love some of that.' 

Cohen writes that when he told Trump that it was his daughter, Trump replied: 'When did she get so hot?' 

Trump is also said to have been dismissive of some of his own children, including his eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and youngest daughter Tiffany.
