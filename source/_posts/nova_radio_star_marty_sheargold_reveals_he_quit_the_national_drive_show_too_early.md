'I gave the news too far out,' Marty said during his appearance as a panelist on Have You Been Paying Attention? on Monday night. 

He said he struggled to get up and go to work after revealing he quit. 

'It's been an absolute mental mountain to climb every day to get in there,' Marty said. 

Moving on: In July, Marty announced the news that he's leaving Nova, explaining to co-hosts Kate Ritchie and Tim Blackwell (pictured) that he 'spent the last 'four or five months tossing up' what to do in 2021

He also joked that he has 'considered' calling in sick for his very last day on-air this Friday. 

Marty has been working from his Melbourne home in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

In July, Marty announced the news that he was leaving Nova, explaining to his co-hosts Kate Ritchie and Tim Blackwell that he 'spent the last 'four or five months tossing up' what to do in 2021. 

'Kate, Tim and Marty will no longer feature Marty at the end of the day,' he said on-air. 'Thank you to the network for having me, putting up with me.'

'Over the last four or five months I've been tossing up what I'd like to do in 2021, and what I've decided to do is leave the show,' he continued.

'I'd like to thank Tim and Kate for their support of my decision and wish them continued success with the show.

'Now feels like the right time for me professionally to keep challenging myself and to embrace future opportunities with renewed vigour and enthusiasm.'
