Bebe Rexha is proving her love life is not 'a mess' like she has sung about in the past. 

The Brooklyn native - who just rang in her 31st birthday a few weeks ago - confirmed on Thursday that she is in a new romance with filmmaker Keyan Safyari as the two were seen sharing a passionate kiss.

The hitmaker surprised her man with a ride in a Ferrari to celebrate his birthday after they packed on the PDA in her driveway.

The singer was undoubtedly smitten with her beau as she tenderly embraced him while her dog Bear looked on.

Keyan, who is a television and commercial cinematographer, was seen decked out for his special day in all black. 

He sported a pair of fitted black jeans and a crisp black button down, throwing on a pair of stylish black suede boots and black sunglasses.

The rumored couple were first spotted out together in March during an outing at Delilah before pictures of them getting increasingly cozy began to surface in July.   

Rexha has claimed publicly that her last relationship ended in 2015 after saying she was not 'one to throw her heart around.'

Talking to Health in May 2019, Rexha spoke out about her sexual fluidity, revealing, 'I just want to find someone I love and who loves me—and I don’t care if that’s a boy or a girl.' 

Five years later it appears as if she has found her happy ending though she admits to being incredibly guarded.

Recently Bebe performed at the Sound of Beirut festival, a virtual concert to give back to the city after the devastating August 4th explosion in Lebanon. 

On her birthday, the singer took to the virtual VMA stage to present Video of the Year to the Weeknd for his song Blinding Lights. 

When it comes to new music she shared on social media that she would not be releasing her new music until 'the world is in a better place.'

'I can not wait for you to hear it. It’s just that we don’t feel like it’s right to release an album during these times' she told her fans.
