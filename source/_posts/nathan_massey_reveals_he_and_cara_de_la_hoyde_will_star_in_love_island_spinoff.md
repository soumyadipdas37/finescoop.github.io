Nathan Massey revealed his newborn daughter, Delilah, has been suffering from colic as he discussed struggling with 'sleepless nights' after a 'challenging' yet rewarding pregnancy for his partner, Cara De La Hoyde. 

The Love Island star, 28, reflected on the eventful months following his daughter's birth in July, and revealed that his growing family will star in the reality spin-off, Love Islanders: What Happened Next? which will air later this year. 

He also disclosed whether he will have more children in the future with his wife, 30, who he first met on the 2016 series of Love Island.

Speaking to promote his work with breast cancer charity, Future Dreams, Nathan exclusively told the MailOnline: 'It was challenging for Cara going through pregnancy and labour during the pandemic.

'I couldn't go to midwife appointments or scans but I was there at the birth. I want other people to know it's nothing to be scared of and the hospital were absolutely great at looking after us.

'Yes we've definitely had a lot on our plate since Delilah was born - she's had colic, so there have been a lot of sleepless nights looking after her.'   

Nathan said the couple's eldest child, son Freddie, two, has been fulfilling his big brother duties by doting on his younger sibling. 

Family matters: The Love Island star, 28, reflected on his daughter's birth in July, and revealed to MailOnline that his family will star in the new spin-off, Love Islanders: What Happened Next?

He added: 'Freddie absolutely loves her, he can't get enough of being her big brother and is constantly checking up on her.'    

Nathan and Cara haven't ruled out the possibility of having more children and they are excited for their evolving love story to be documented on an hour-long episode of the Love Island spin-off, which will air this autumn.

Nathan told MailOnline: 'Yes definitely, I think Cara wants more kids in the future but I am fine with two for now. 

'We are going to be back on your screens soon and have already filmed a Love Islanders: What Happened Next show which is out soon.

Nathan said: 'It was challenging for Cara going through pregnancy and labour during the pandemic, I couldn't go to midwife appointments or scans but I was there at the birth'

'It was really nice to do as it follows us now in our family life and everything that has happened since exiting the villa.

'After all we are what the show was originally all about... meet someone and fall in love! And here we are four years later married with two children!'   

When he's not busy filming the follow-up episode for ITV2, Nathan has been using his platform to promote the campaign, Let's Nail Breast Cancer 2020, for the charity, Future Dreams.

He said: 'It was great fun getting involved in the campaign, and I think it is so important raise awareness about breast cancer. 

'Cancer is something that affects everyone, and I think it's important to do what I can to speak openly about it and encourage others to do the same.

Similar to Movember - which raises awareness for prostate cancer annually - Nathan hopes to create the October equivalent for breast cancer by encouraging men to paint their nails pink. 

Nathan joined TV stars Callum Best and Thomas Skinner for the campaign as a technician painted his fingers a fuchsia hue and they showcased their solidarity for one in seven women and approximately 370 men who are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK. 

He joked: 'It was a laugh having our nails painted, it was definitely something different. I don't mind a bit of pampering, I can see why Cara spends so much time getting her nails done!

'What I've learned is it's good to go to the doctors to get things checked, so if anything happens, you can catch it early. I want to spread that message.' 

Cara's cousin tragically passed away from cancer at the age of 19 in 2017, and she experienced her own cancer scare when she discovered she was expecting their first child in 2017.

So, the topic is very close to the couple's heart as Nathan added: 'Staying aware is something very important to Cara and I, as both her aunt and cousin passed away due to cancer, so she also stays up to date with her smear tests.' 

He also talked to breast cancer survivor, Philip Anderson, who found a new lease of life after overcoming the disease. 

Nathan said: 'I was speaking to a great guy called Phil who was at the shoot and I distinctly remember him saying he was playing with his daughter and felt a sharp pain in his chest. He then discovered a small pea shaped mass behind his nipple. 

'He went and got it checked out early and it turned out to be breast cancer which I didn't know existed in men. 

'It was an eye-opening experience talking to him and learning what he has gone through. He was very proud and spoke openly about his experiences, like a badge of honor. '

Breast cancer is rare in men. There are about 350 men diagnosed each year in the UK. This compares to around 55,000 cases in women. 

The most common form of cancer in women and men is called 'invasive breast carcinoma - no special type'. 

The risk factors for male breast cancer include:

The most common symptom for men with breast cancer is a lump in the breast area. This is nearly always painless.
