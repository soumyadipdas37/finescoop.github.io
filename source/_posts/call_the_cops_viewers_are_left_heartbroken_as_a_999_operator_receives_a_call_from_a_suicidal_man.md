Call the Cops viewers were left 'heartbroken' after a 999 operator received a call from a man wanting to end his own life. 

In last night's episode of the Channel 4 show, the control room received an emergency call to be on the lookout for a missing 20-year-old man, known only as Danny, in Cornwall who was reported to be suicidal and whose whereabouts were uncertain. 

Soon, it become apparent the man, who was eventually found, was staring into a disused mine shaft, but with several in the area, it was up to the police to try and figure out which one. 

And as the emotional scene unfolded, those who tuned in were quick to take to Twitter, desperate for the man's safe return.   

'Heartbreaking listening to a man about to end his life,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'Well done everyone involved especially the call handlers . Thank goodness he was found.'

Receiving the call, a 999 operator spoke to the suicidal man who could be heard saying: 'I swear to god I'm going to hang myself. I'm climbing the pyramid on the shaft thingy.

'I can't do f*** all 'cos I'm on probation so I may as well just go kill myself. All afternoon mate, I've thought about it and this is it. I've already put on Facebook 'RIP I'm gone.'

And when asked by the operator why he wanted to kill himself, Danny, replied: 'I can't even go to the doctor because of my anxiety and depression.'

'I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'm at the top of the pyramid. I can see right down it. i reckon if I fell, I'd hang onto a branch and snap and die.' 

Another 999 phone operator (pictured) told how she has received calls from suicidal people in the past and has been on the end of the phone shaking

Turning to the camera, another concerned 999 operator explained: 'We've had 999 calls from suicidal people and I've been on the end of the phone shaking speaking to them.

You just think, "please, please let us have someone available to get to them. '

'I think the people that phone us, the majority of the time, it is a cry or help. But whose to day this time, it's not going to happen? I'm not going to make that decision.' 

As the phone operator continued to urge Danny not to do anything stupid, he could be heard saying: 'If you want to come here and arrest me I'm going to run and hide. I'm going to go somewhere else to another mine shaft.'

Eventually, a helicopter was able to locate the man in question, and ground police were able to find him and bring him to safety.

Following the episode, social media was inundated with well-wishes for the man, with many adding they hope he receives the help he needs. 

'Well done all officers on #callthecops tonight. So brave putting themselves at risk to find a man in urgent need of help. Hope he gets the help he needs,' wrote one, while a second added: 'Hopefully he will get the help he needs now.' 

A third wrote: 'Amazing teamwork to find that poor lad, really shows that it's not just criminals that the police deal with. Great effort everyone, you all do an amazing job,'
