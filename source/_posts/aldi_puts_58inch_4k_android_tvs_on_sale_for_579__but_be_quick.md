Aldi Australia is releasing a limited number of 58-inch 4K Ultra HD Android televisions for $579.

But bargain hunters will need to get in quick as limited stock will be available at stores across Australia.

Aldi sold out within minutes of opening stores across the country for its 65" version of the same television seven weeks ago.

Disappointed customers expressed frustration on social media about stock levels after missing out.

'They will only have one per store with 100s waiting at the door, Typical ALDI Australia,' one customer wrote. 

'Just ridiculous that there was only 8 TVs in the store and all gone in the 1st minute,' another wrote.

One woman described watching an elderly man get pushed over in customers' haste to get to the item. 

The September 19 special buys sale will also feature a number of accessories, including a Fabric Soundbar for $89.99 and a movable TV wall mount for $59.99.  

The sound bar features two 20W remote-controlled speakers with optical inputs, Bluetooth and USB playback.  

Each of the devices also come with a one year warranty.
