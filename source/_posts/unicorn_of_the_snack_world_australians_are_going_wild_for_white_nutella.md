An Aussie food reviewer has posted an image of a jar of white Nutella, sending his followers into a frenzy. 

Blogger 'Bruce Super Convenience' shared a picture of the iconic spread with one key difference to his Instagram. 

The filling inside was a creamy white instead of the traditional hazelnut milk chocolate flavour.

'Let's just take a moment to look at this picture, and appreciate this unicorn of a snack,' said the reviewer. 

Prominent Australian food blogger 'Bruce Super Convenience' shared a picture to his Instagram of a jar of the iconic spread with one key difference

'This jar, with that logo so famous, is found on shelves ALL over the world. But alas, it's always a dark brown colour ... milk chocolate flavour.

'This one has a white - slightly golden - colour, and even look at the toast in the picture, it has a white spread on it!' 

The reviewer told followers he had been sent a sample of the product by fellow food blogger The Snack Controller.  

But much to the disappointment of fans he also revealed the delicious snack was not available for purchase.

'Ok, I'm going to be bombarded with messages and DM's, so let me answer right now - no, this is not a real product, and no, you cannot buy your body's weight of this product!'

Hundreds of fans have been going wild over the prospect of white Nutella since the image began circulating on social media. 

Fans will have to settle for the original hazelnut flavour Nutella instead

'This is a dream come true,' one woman wrote.

'My brain cant handle it... but it's beautiful,' another said.

The product was crafted and made by Queensland food blogger 'The Snack Controller' using a recipe from another Instagrammer - 'aufstrichqueen_vera'. 

He combined two blocks of white chocolate, a bag of Kinder white Schokobons, a scoop of hazelnut butter with a drizzle of the oil, hazelnut syrup and regular  sunflower oil.

He also gave fans a few tips for the best ways to eat it.
