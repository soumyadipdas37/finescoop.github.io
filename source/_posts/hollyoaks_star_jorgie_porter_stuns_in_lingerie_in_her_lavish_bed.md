She's recently been seen dating hunky businessman Ollie Piotrowski in her hometown of Manchester. 

Yet Jorgie Porter, 32, was kicking back alone on Saturday as she shared a duo of sultry snaps while reclining in her giant new double bed. 

The former Hollyoaks star took to Instagram to post two images of herself sporting a silken low-cut lingerie top as she lay in her unmade bed.

In one of her sultry snaps, Jorgie sipped on a lemon-infused beverage, while in the second she posed with her arms pointed up in the air. 

While she was showing off her cleavage she was also showing of her stunning good looks as she went make-up free and wore her hair in a mussed style.   

Her bed was a sea of fur blankets and cushions, while she was showcasing her eye for interiors with her stylish tree print wallpaper. 

Jorgie herself sat up against a huge stack of cushions, while sharing her health secrets with fans with the caption.

Boasting about its hidden storage capacity, Jorgie added: 'Stores my summer clothes underneath in an ottoman style it’s insanely brilliant!!!' 

And just in case fans had not quite got the message, she captioned her second post: 'obsessed with my new ottoman bed.' 

Jorgie has most recently been seen making the most of her relative freedom to roam, when she was spotted enjoying a dinner date with hunky businessman Ollie, 31, in Manchester on Thursday night.

Ollie boasts years of experience as a businessman, serving as the managing director of Pinnacle Holdings, which oversees a broad range of property investments.

He also has fashion credentials among his portfolio, serving as the co-owner of new brand Transpire Clothing.

Jorgie's outing came several months after she admitted that, after getting plenty of attention on dating apps, she had decided to start virtual dating some of her matches.
