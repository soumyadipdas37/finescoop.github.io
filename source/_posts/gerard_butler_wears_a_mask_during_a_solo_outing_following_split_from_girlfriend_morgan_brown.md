News that Gerard Butler had split from longtime girlfriend Morgan Brown went public just two weeks ago.

And on Thursday the newly-single 300 star was spotted while out and about in the West Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The 50-year-old actor made sure to wear a protective mask whenever he got out of his SUV to take care of an errand, which is in accordance to health and safety protocols amid the still raging COVID-19 pandemic.

Butler opted to keep it casual-cool in the fashion department in blue denim jeans and a white t-shirt.  

He also donned a pair of black leather boots and dark Aviator-style sunglasses   

The Scotland native is also still sporting a full beard and mustache underneath the mask he wore while out in public.

Butler is set to star in the Joe Carnahan-directed action thriller Copshop, alongside Frank Grillo, as reported by a number of publications including Deadline. 

In the film, a small-town police station becomes the unlikely battleground between a professional hitman (Butler), a smart rookie female cop, and a double-crossing con man (Grillo) who seeks refuge behind bars with no place left to run.  

The role of the female lead is still pending. 

Principal photography has been slated to begin in October with shoots in Georgia and New Mexico.

The premiere of Butler's latest movie Greenland, which has been delayed two times since June due to the coronavirus crisis, is now slated to be released in the US September 25. 

The apocalyptic family drama film, directed by Ric Roman Waugh of Angel Has Fallen fame, has already premiered in Belgium, France and Scandinavia.

Greenland, which also stars Morena Baccarin and Scott Glenn, tells the story of a disintegrating comet that begins falling to earth and leveling cities, resulting in chaos and madness throughout the world. 

Butler and and his ex Brown, a real estate developer and designer, parted ways after dating for more than six years, according to PEOPLE in late August.

They were last snapped publicly sharing a kiss on Venice Beach in early August.
