A paedophile found with more than 2,000 images of child abuse material began looking at the horrific content daily due to his 'abnormal penis', a court has heard. 

Rhys Jaden Friend, 19, from the Sunshine Coast, was arrested in May 2019 after sending a link containing footage of boys aged nine to 12 engaging in oral and anal sex.

He then sent a message to the unnamed recipient saying 'now it's your turn', the Sunshine Coast Daily reported. 

The teenager pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing child exploitation material at the Maroochydore District Court on Monday.

The teenager's defence lawyer Mark Dixon said his client, who has autism, didn't know how serious the offences were until he was arrested.  

'[My client] was born with a condition that affects his genitalia,' Mr Dixon told the court.

'It is a condition that has required a number of surgeries over the years and it is a condition that led him to be obsessive over his, what he always viewed to be, an abnormal penis as opposed to what was normal.

'That seems to be the catalyst or the trigger for him initially looking for this material.'

He said his client was distributing the material so he could be sent more in return.

The court heard how police had no idea how much content was exchanged because of the way in which it was send.  

However when police searched Friend's home in Sippy Downs the seized laptops and phones.

They uncovered 2,213 images and 122 movies on the teen's devices - 186 of which were in the most serious category.

Crown prosecutor Christopher Cook told the court that the teenager was seeking out the material. 

Judge Richard Jones said the material that was found on the teenager's laptop was particularly disturbing and 'repugnant'.

However, he also noted no previous criminal history, a troubled childhood, the offender's age and his willingness to be cooperative with police, while sentencing. 

Judge Jones sentenced the teenager to three years probation for possessing the child exploitation material, as well as one year in jail for distributing it.

However, the prison sentence was suspended for three years.

A conviction was recorded for distributing the child abuse material, but not possessing it.
