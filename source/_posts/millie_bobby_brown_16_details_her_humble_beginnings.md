Appearing on BBC Radio One's Millie Bobby Brown: The Story So Far, revealed her father Robert would drive her to auditions across LA, yet they did not have enough money for gas so could only go if she knew all her words. 

Ahead of her big break in Stranger Things, the actress, 16, Millie and her dad fought hard for her fame, yet she insists she is unchanged by her stardom.   

Way back when: Millie Bobby Brown has detailed the humble start to her stardom

On her rise to fame, ever-humble Millie candidly revealed: 'We would drive 45 minutes drive into LA every single day, I'd get a Mountain Dew and these seeds, these nuts because I was so freaked and nervous.'

She revealed that to up her chances of getting roles, Millie, who grew up in Bournemouth, would put on an American accent. 

She said: 'In the audition, I'd do a full American accent for the full audition, they though I was American - higher chance for role...

[I'd wear] long socks with Chucks, denim shorts, stripe tee No logo, curled hair, no make-up, ready for audition., do it every single day

Open and honest: Appearing on BBC Radio One's Millie Bobby Brown: The Story So Far, revealed her father Robert would drive her to auditions across LA, yet they did not have enough money for gas so could only go if she knew all her words

'We did not have enough money for gas, dad wouldn't drive me in unless I knew every line. Desperate to be on camera/work. I was very grateful and honoured to get the role but I was very wanting.'

On her rise to fame, she said: 'I don't think I've ever looked at myself and thought I'm famous' she said most crazy moment in her career is meeting Obama.  

She also appeared on Roman Kemp's Capital Breakfast Show.

The I'm A Celeb star asked her: 'One thing that I know would’ve upset you, I know you’re a massive Kardashian fan, what did you make of them saying that it’s finishing, Keeping up with the Kardashians?'

Happy days: Ahead of her big break in Stranger Things, the actress, 16, Millie and her dad fought hard for her fame, yet she insists she is unchanged by her stardom

She responded: 'I mean I have loved that show since I was 9 years old, I’ve been watching every single season. I just think that it’s genuinely the best reality show and I guess I just have to restart it and watch it again....

'But I’m very sad to know that that’s what’s going on. My older sister is devastated but I’m obviously sad, it’s horrible, they are an iconic family that you love to watch and they say the funniest things, so I’m definitely going to miss them'. 

Roman said: 'A lot of people will…well listen the relationship you seemingly have with your brother, I mean what’s the chance of you getting your own reality show?' 

She replied: 'Everyone says this but we cannot have our own reality show [laughs]. We just can’t, I mean we’re just all very crazy and very loud and I don’t think any crew member would ever want to be in our house'.
