Bachelor in Paradise wrapped up just under a month ago.  

But ever since, Ciarran Stott's Instagram following has taken a hit with the reality star losing followers daily. 

According to The Wash Online the 26-year-old has lost on average 353 followers a day.

Ciarran boasted 126,232 followers on August 20, but those numbers have plummeted to 123,764 as of September 2.  

His largest unfollowing occurred on August 24 with a whopping 595 fans opting not to keep up to date with the cheeky Brit. 

Other large losses include 308 on August 27 and 285 on August 23. 

It is unknown what may have caused the dramatic drop in followers, however Ciarran certainly ruffled feathers during his time on the Channel Ten dating show.

Ciarran told the Manchester Evening News in April he was convinced he'd get a 'villain' edit on the show and feared his public image would be tarnished when it went to air.  

'I think I'll go from the sweetheart of Australia to the bad boy of Australia so that won't be good,' he said. 

During his time on the show, Ciarran was embroiled in various hook-ups, first with Abbie Chatfield, 25, before moving on to Jessica Brody, 30.   

When Kiki Morris, 32, arrived in Paradise, he quickly ditched Jess, with revelations coming to the fore that Ciarran and Kiki had met prior to the show and formulated a plan to couple up once she arrived.

Matters were complicated by his ex-girlfriend, Renee Barrett, 26, also appearing on the show, and harbouring the belief that she and Ciarran, who had split just over a week prior to filming, would reunite. 

Ciarran quit the show shortly before the final rose ceremony, taking Kiki with him - only for the pair to split two months later.      

Then he had fans fuming during the finale after he said he could get back with his Renee, who was dating Matt Whyatt, 'if he wanted'. 

'Another said: 'The way Ciarran blindly admitted to treating women as disposable... throw the whole man out', while a third branded the tattooed British lad a 'misogynist'.
