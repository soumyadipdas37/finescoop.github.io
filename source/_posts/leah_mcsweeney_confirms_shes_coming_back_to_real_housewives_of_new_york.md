Leah McSweeney has just confirmed she's returning to Real Housewives of New York for season 13.

The 38-year-old revealed the news on Instagram while sharing a post announcing that she recently signed with WME.

In the comments she wrote that she's 'comin back' to the Bravo series, while adding 'My work here isn't done yet!'.

Leah was reportedly in contract negotiations to return to RHONY after it was revealed she earned $3,000 per episode for season 12.  

TMZ reported that the fan-favorite was offended by the 'miniscule' offer of a similar contract from her breakout season and was demanding more money. 

She joined the cast as a friend of Tinsley Mortimer, but Mortimer left midseason after a proposal from her on-off boyfriend, Scott Kluth.

Meanwhile, Leah proudly revealed her bruised face after undergoing a rhinoplasty and septoplasty last week. 

The fashion designer admitted she wasn't 'trying to hide anything' as she detailed the procedure while showing off black eyes and a bandage across her nose in a clip she posted to Instagram.

'People are DM-ing me like crazy inquiring why I have black eyes and asking if I got a nose job, asking if i got beat up,' she said on social media.

'I am not trying to hide anything from anybody. I got a rhinoplasty and a septoplasty. I could not be happier.'

'I've been wanting one for so freaking long and now I can also breathe, which is great,' she told her fans. 'I love my doctor. He's a great guy ... he's an amazing doctor, his name is Dr. Daniel Maman.

In true Leah fashion, she assured her fans that the cosmetic work wouldn't change her honest and open demeanor.

'I'm just never going to be one of those b****es that pretends like it's not work, it's contour makeup, because that's f***ing weird.'
