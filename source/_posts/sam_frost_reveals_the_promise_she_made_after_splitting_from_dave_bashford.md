Sam Frost has revealed her ex-boyfriend Dave Bashford still holds a special place in her heart, even though they are no longer dating.

The couple, who had previously been friends for years before getting together, split in July after almost three years.

'Dave's an amazing person and that's never going to change,' the Home and Away star, 31, told TV Week of their relationship.

'It wasn't an ugly or messy break-up; it was just two people who love each other dearly as friends, and we promised to look after each other,' she added.

Sam went through two public splits before ending things with Dave: the first was with Blake Garvey in 2015, and the second was with Sasha Mielczarek in 2016. 

Unlike those break-ups, Sam said she didn't care about any media backlash this time.

'Dave is one of my best friends and for me, we will always support each other, so it was easy. We knew there was a lot of speculation,' she said. 

On July 2, a representative for the actress released a statement saying: 'Sam and Dave are no longer in a relationship. They remain great mates.'

Sam had hinted at a split several days earlier, when she shared footage to TikTok of herself posing with her dogs and mocking the viral 'couple challenge'. 

Dave was nowhere to be seen, and Sam tellingly included the hashtag #31SingleAndFabulous.

A source had allegedly 'confirmed' their split to Woman's Day in January, saying that Sam had decided to prioritise her career over romance.

'It all became too much for Sam who was going through a lot,' the insider said at the time.

'When things are good, they're both very happy, but the lows are bad. They argue over trivial things.'

Sam rose to fame by winning the 2014 season of The Bachelor, starring Blake Garvey.

After their relationship ended, she became Australia's first Bachelorette the following year and went on to date winner Sasha Mielczarek for 18 months before splitting up.

In July 2017, Sam confirmed that she was dating her longtime pal Dave.
