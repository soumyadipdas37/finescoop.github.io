A savvy home cook has shared her go-to recipe for delicious chicken wings and how she makes the skin perfectly crispy every time.

Posting to a popular Australian cookery group, Cassie revealed she used her handy air fryer to cook the poultry and followed a simple recipe online.

'I have eaten these crispy chicken wings at least five times in the past fortnight, addicted much?' she said.

The recipe from Cook It Real Good is simple to follow, uses few ingredients and takes less than half an hour to complete.

To season the chicken wings, a combination of salt, pepper, garlic powder and baking powder is used.

But before dousing the chicken in the dry rub seasoning, Cassie said it's important to thoroughly dry the meat with paper towel. 

She also said she didn't use any oil, used Mckenzie's baking powder instead, before cooking the meat on a low heat followed by a high heat.

'150 [degrees] for five minutes, then 200 for ten to 15 minutes until cooked through and crispy,' she said.

'I start with low heat, then finish with high heat - the fat in the chicken skin will be rendered and drained without overcooking the meat.' 

Many were impressed with how simple the dish is to make and commented words of praise on the Facebook post.

'Yum! They look amazing and I'll probably try it tomorrow,' one woman said

'These look good,' another said, a third added: 'Looks yummy! Thank you.' 

Thoroughly dry the wings on a paper towel before adding seasoning

Don't use any oil – the wings render fat while cooking

Use baking powder, not baking soda – this helps the chicken to brown and reacts with any moisture left to crisp the meat
