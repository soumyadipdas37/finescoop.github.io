Alvaro Morata has arrived at Juventus' training base to undergo a medical as his sensational return to the Old Lady edges closer.

The striker left the Serie A club to join Real Madrid in 2016 but is set to rejoin the club on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid - with his exit paving the way for Luis Suarez's arrival from Barcelona, if they allow it to happen.

And Morata has been pictured arriving at the club's training ground with fans lining up to catch a glimpse of the returning star, who posed for pictures and waved at supporters.

The Spaniard touched down in Turin on Monday night and the club, who will have an option to buy the forward at the end of the season. shared photos of the 27-year-old arriving at the airport and he gave the cameras a thumbs up. 

Morata scored 12 goals and made two assists for Atletico in the 2019-20 season after making his loan move from Chelsea permanent last summer.

The forward never hit the heights expected of him at Stamford Bridge but fared better in LaLiga, where he managed 43 goals in 112 games for both Atletico and Real.

The striker scored 15 goals across two years in his first spell with Juve but Morata is arguably the club's second choice after missing out on Suarez.

Juve had long held an interest in the Barca man and he passed an Italian exam in Perugia last week in order to acquire dual nationality, with the club being unable to bring in any more non-EU players in this transfer window following the arrivals of Arthur Melo and Weston McKennie. 

But manager Andrea Pirlo admitted the move would be difficult because of the time it takes for a passport to be approved with October 5 the deadline for moves to be completed.

The Uruguayan's six-year stint at the Nou Camp is coming to a bitter end despite him being Barca's third highest goalscorer of all time. 

Suarez's arrival at Atletico would come as a huge boost to Simeone's side, although recent reports suggest Barcelona are making a last-ditch attempt to block the move as they try to add Atletico to their 'vetoed list'. 

Morata's exit will now pave the way for Luis Suarez to join Atletico Madrid from Barcelona

Onda Cero report that Barcelona are trying to add Atletico Madrid - the favourites for his signature - to a list of 'vetoed clubs' that he can't join, alongside Real Madrid, PSG and Manchester City.

Even though new boss Ronald Koeman has stated Suarez is not part of his plans, there are concerns that the Uruguayan will help a direct rival, which would come as a blow even more so if he joins them for free.

As such, Atletico are weighing up a move for PSG striker Edinson Cavani in case the Suarez move falls through.
