She caught the eye with her glamorous and glitzy ensembles in The Great Gatsby. 

But Carey Mulligan cut a casual figure in a dark green coat and straight leg trousers as she grabbed lunch with friends at The Wolseley in central London on Wednesday. 

The actress, 35, embraced the colder temperatures with her effortlessly stylish outfit as she called for a taxi outside the upmarket restaurant.

The screen star paired her tailored wrap coat with a high-neck top, Gucci trainers and a black satchel that draped over her shoulder. 

Carey opted for a minimal make-up look and protected her delicate features with edgy circular shades. 

The blonde beauty tucked her tresses in a turquoise hair tie and she added a delicate touch with gold pendant earrings. 

She clutched a Soho Hotel bag in her hand, exposing her glistening wedding and engagement ring as she spoke to the taxi driver.

The actress has kept a relatively low profile during the coronavirus pandemic but was seen out and about in Los Angeles in August, catching up with pals and running errands.   

The star recently opened up to NET-A-PORTER's digital publication, PORTER, in which she discussed her thoughts on the #MeToo movement, life after children and toxic masculinity in her new film Promising Young Woman. 

The award-winning actress, who shares Evelyn, four, and Wilfred, two, with musician husband Marcus Mumford, 33, also insisted she's content with juggling her career with motherhood, sharing: 'I haven't been in a bar in ages, and I’m very glad of that'.

Carey has also been promoting her new movie, Promising Young Woman, which follows the story of her character Cassie, a barista who feels unfulfilled in her life. 

In a bid to lift her spirits, the medical school dropout lets loose at bars every week, where she becomes intoxicated and on the brink of passing out.  

During one raucous outing, men who pretend to 'help' her, end up attempting to take advantage of her drunken state.  

The thespian claimed her project, penned and directed by Killing Eve showrunner, Emerald Fennell, highlights the importance of awareness surrounding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity.  

The British actress said: 'It’s funny, because the reaction I first had when I read the script was, "This is soooo romantic".

'[But] Emerald’s [point] was: if [you] take someone home and they are really drunk, and then that person reveals they are not drunk, and you feel guilty, then you know what you are doing isn’t right.'

'What we reflected on, making this film, was the amount of real-life stories like this we know. A lot of this film is stuff that pretty much every woman I know has experienced in some way. '

When asked whether she misses her life before welcoming her kids, the mother-of-two, who wed musician Marcus in April 2012, declared: 'Noooo. 

'In fact, every time we stepped into a new bar set, Emerald and I would both be like, "God, we haven’t been in a bar in a really long time". And I’m very glad of that.'
