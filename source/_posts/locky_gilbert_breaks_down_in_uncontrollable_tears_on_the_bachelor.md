But Locky Gilbert still could not decide between Irena Srbinovska and Bella Veralis right up until the very end of The Bachelor finale on Thursday night.Â 

The burly Survivor star, 30, broke down into uncontrollable tears before choosing his winner.

Isn't he a grown man? Locky Gilbert breaks down in uncontrollable tears as he can't decide betweek Bella and Irena during Bachelor finale after telling them BOTH he loves them

He declared: 'Being in love is the best feeling in the world and I've got that twice. And so I'm in love with two girls. You think about it and you're like, how is that even possible?'

'They don't deserve to get their hearts broken,' he said.

Things got incredibly emotional when he started to reflect upon both women and what they offered him, as he began to break down in tears in front of the camera.

'Oh, my God, just thinking about it. I don't wanna break anyone's heart. I love 'em both.

'How am I meant to do it? Like, you don't break up with someone that you love.'

He then began gasping for air, before sighing and saying 'for f**ks sake!'
