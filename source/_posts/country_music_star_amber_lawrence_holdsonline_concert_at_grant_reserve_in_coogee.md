Amber Lawrence is embracing her fans in a whole new way in the wake of COVID-19. 

The country music star broadcast a live concert - straight from a picnic bench at Grant Reserve in Coogee, NSW, on Sunday. 

The 42-year-old was set up with an acoustic guitar, computer and a microphone as she belted out tunes for fans watching at home.

She looked delighted with the outcome and appeared to be genuinely enjoying the performance on what was a sunny Sydney day. 

Amber spruced herself up for the special event, wearing a maxi dress with a geometric print in muted tones.  

The singer added a trusty brown Akubra hat and natural makeup, her brown hair down around her face in waves. 

That's different! She performed from a picnic bench at the seaside Sydney suburb

Plug: She showed off her new live DVD for anyone who might want to purchase a copy 

She beamed as she posed barefoot for a series of photos at Coogee beach, standing along the water's edge at a sea pool.

Amber and her husband Martin Newman, who she met on Tinder in 2016, wed in a stunning ceremony in Port Douglas, in tropical far north Queensland, in May 2018. 

The couple are proud parents to two-year-old son Ike. 

At the end of July, the couple announced that they are grieving the loss of their son Edward.

So happy! She looked delighted with the outcome and appeared to be genuinely enjoying the performance on what was a sunny Sydney day

Amber had a stillbirth halfway through her pregnancy, detailing the 'horrific' pain in an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Confidential.

The four-time Golden Guitar winner understandably said it was incredibly difficult for the couple to leave the hospital without their baby.   

'Giving birth and leaving the baby there [at the hospital] is the most horrific thing,' Amber told the publication.  

Amber and Martin cremated their son followed by a farewell ceremony. 

Tragic: In an Instagram post on July 29, Amber shared a black and white photo of herself and husband Martin Newman with her baby Edward, revealing he had been stillborn
