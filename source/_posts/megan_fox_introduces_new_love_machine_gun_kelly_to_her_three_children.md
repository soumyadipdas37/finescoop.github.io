The insider also shared that Megan and Machine Gun, 30 - whose real name is Colson Baker - are still in the early phase of their relationship, however.

They 'aren’t seriously taking about getting engaged, married or having kids right now and they’re not there yet.'

And it was shared that Fox might be playing games already with the performer because she likes to 'keep him guessing' and will be 'hot and heavy with him one day and cold the next.'

'They are definitely super into each other. MGK is obsessed with Megan,' said the friend.

 Kelly has a 12-year-old daughter Cassie from a previous relationship but it was not noted whether Megan has met her yet.

Last week the singer said he may never be single again after finding love with Fox. 

He now seemingly suggested he thinks their love will last forever, as he admitted there'll be 'no dates' with other women in his future. 

Kelly appeared on an episode of Thirst Tweets for BuzzFeed Celeb, and read one message in which a fan asked if they could take him out for dinner.

To which he responded: 'I'm locked in already right now. No dates for me. Probably ever.'  

The two got close on the set of Midnight In The Switchgrass. 

The movie's director, Randall Emmett, revealed the pair are 'very happy' in their romance, which he described as 'sweet and beautiful' to see. 

He said: 'They're very passionate about one another and very happy, and I mean, it's really sweet to see that I had a little hand in that. 

Kelly's declaration of lasting love comes after it was recently claimed the couple are 'very passionate'

'The chemistry [on set] was second to none, but I just thought, I'm a great director! I didn't know there were these undertones and all that, and now, we spend a lot of time with them since they've been together and it's really sweet and beautiful, and I'm really happy for both of them.' 

Randall and his fiancée Lala Kent have been on double dates with Megan and Kelly and the filmmaker joked the new couple are 'glued to each other'. 

He added: 'Let me tell you the joke I make about our double dates, and they know I say this to their face: Going on a double date with Megan and Colson, it's like an individual date and a double date. 

'The first half is very 'double date.' Everybody is conversing, we're having fun, we're laughing. The second half, they don't even know our name. They're just glued to each other!'
