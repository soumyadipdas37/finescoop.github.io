Trendsetters are set to be divided over a pair of worn-looking jeans from Gucci's autumn/winter collection.

The Italian luxury brand is selling their Eco washed organic denim pants for £600, complete with the illusion of fresh grass stains around the knee area.

Gucci claims the material has been specifically treated to channel a 'grunge vibe' throughout Fall Winter 2020.

Gucci specifically treated the jeans to achieve a distressed appearance that evoke a 'grunge vibe' as part of their autumn/ winter collection 

The jeans that look as if they've been seen better days before they've even been purchased, have faded brown spots in addition to bizarre green stains.

While ripped jeans are a common trend each autumn the addition of dirty marks has failed to impress some fashionistas.

The model on Gucci's website is seen pairing the unconventional look with a check print shirt and loafers.

However the brand is also selling a £700 Rib knit wool oversize jumper with holes and frayed edges that could equally complete the rough look.

Gucci describe the jeans as a new take on blurring the line between vintage and contemporary.

The product description on their website reads: 'Channelling the Fall Winter 2020 collection’s grunge vibe, this wide-leg denim pant is crafted from organic cotton specifically treated for a stained-like, distressed effect. 

Gucci explained the jeans are a new take on blurring the line between vintage and contemporary

'Gucci explores new takes on the cult fabric, reinterpreting it with different designs and washing techniques that blur the line between vintage and contemporary. 

'All organic cotton leftovers from the cutting process for this product are then upcycled into new materials under the “Gucci Up” program. Pieces with versatile ways to wear and style embrace each person who is part of the House’s individual spirit.'

The jeans designed specifically to look dated come a year after Gucci made headlines with $870 distressed trainers.

The footwear had been given a specific effect to create the appearance that they were old with the brand claiming they had been influenced by Seventies fashion.
