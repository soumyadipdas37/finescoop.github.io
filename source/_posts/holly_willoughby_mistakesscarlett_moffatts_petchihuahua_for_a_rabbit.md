The Gogglebox star, 29, appeared on the hit ITV chatshow to discuss her appearance on ITV2's new show Celebrity Karaoke Club. 

Yet chat soon turned to Scarlett's boyfriend Scott Dobinson, who appeared in the background carrying her pet dog Bonny.

Holly exclaimed: 'Bunny, is that a rabbit?'

To which a giggling and stunned Scarlett replied: 'No, it's a Chihuahua!' 

With Phillip Schofield adding: 'Bonny, Bonny, not bunny!' 

Holly was left in hysterics as she put her head in her hands and replied: 'I thought you said bunny! I thought you had a pet rabbit! I'm sorry!'

Elsewhere in the interview, Scarlett teased details of ITV2's new show Celebrity Karaoke Club which will be airing at 10pm.

This Morning aired a clip of the I'm A Celebrity star singing Spandau Ballet's Gold, to which she said: 'Honestly, it's like being on a nigh tout with the best people, didn't realise I committed so much to that Spandau Ballet song.'

Although Scarlett jokingly got told off when she tried to compliment Phillip on his wine collaboration with Waitrose as he revealed they can't talk about it on the show.

To which she apologised and said: 'Oh sorry, sorry!'

Resuming talk of Celebrity Karaoke Club, she continued: 'We did it in August, lots of Covid tests, isolated in hotel quite a lot of days, we formed our own social bubble, got to hug people and it was so exciting.'

Scarlett admitted that she doesn't usually do karaoke but after winning the 2016 series of I'm A Celebrity, she is fearless.

She said: 'Everyone always thinks I'm quite confident but I'm a bit of an introvert. I never did karaoke then I came out of the jungle... if I can eat a kangaroo penis, I can definitely sing some Minnie Riperton on karaoke!'

Scarlett admitted that she and her co-stars, she joins RuPaul's Drag Race stars Courtney Act and Baga Chipz, Roman Kemp, Joel Dommett and Jessica Wright - to name a few, drunk a bottle of tequila in the first 30 minutes.

Although that meant the stars taking part were left forgetful over their performances and got a shock when the advert went out.

Scarlett said: 'We have all been messaging each other, asking what song did we sing. I'm sure at one point, Jason Donovan popped up as well, that might of been a dream!'

Talking about how the jungle has made her fearless, she added: 'I think I just care less what people think, in a good way, I don't care at all now. I just enjoy myself and don't worry about looking or feeling silly. I am in the moment!'  

This Morning continues on weekdays at 10am on ITV.
