They are a Hollywood couple who treasure their privacy.

But in a rare interview, actor Jesse Plemons has shed a little light on his romance with his Fargo co-star Kirsten Dunst.

'I knew that she would be in my life for a long time,' Plemons, 32, told the New York Times about the instant connection the two felt when they met on the set of the FX series.

Plemons spoke to the Times as part of his promotion for his new film I'm Thinking Of Ending Things, directed by Charlie Kaufman, which drops on Netflix on Friday.

He and Dunst were cast as a married couple for Fargo's second season and met for the first time in 2015.

About a year and a half later, they started dating and they got engaged in January 2017.

They are now parents to two-year-old son Ennis.

Both Plemons and Dunst, 38, started out as child actors, working steadily in commercials, film and TV shows.

Dunst famously hit the big time at the age of 12 when she starred opposite Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise in Interview with A Vampire and has never looked back.

Plemons' big break came at 18 when he joined the cast of NBC's Friday Night Lights and his movie credits include Bridge Of Spies, The Post and The Irishman.

'We laugh about the fact that we were two child actors and we both made it out OK.' Dunst told the NY Times.

Most recently, the couple worked together on the Jane Campion film The Power Of The Dog.

Plemons stars with Benedict Cumberbatch as two brothers who own a ranch in Montana.

When one of them gets married to Rose, played by Dunst, their relationship starts to fall apart and they find themselves at war with each other. 

The movie was being filmed in New Zealand when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March.

Plemons and Dunst hightailed it back home to LA with their son.

In May, they returned to the country to continue making the movie, undergoing a 14-day quarantine with other cast and crew at a luxury hotel in Auckland. 

Production on the film set for release next year has been completed.
