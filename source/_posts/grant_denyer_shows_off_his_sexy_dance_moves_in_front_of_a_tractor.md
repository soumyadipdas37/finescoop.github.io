He's the affable television presenter that isn't afraid to poke fun at himself.

And this was exactly the case on Tuesday, when Grant Denyer shared a short video to Instagram of himself showing off his 'sexy' dance moves in front of a tractor.

The 43-year-old - who lives just outside of Bathurst, New South Wales with his family - had fans in stitches over the impromptu performance. 

Just a country boy at heart! TV host Grant Denyer, 43, showed off his 'sexy' dance moves in front of a tractor, in a video shared to Instagram on Tuesday (pictured) 

Dressed in a black jacket, grey shorts and work boots, Grant let loose to Kenny Chesney's hit, She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy. 

In a nod to country life, Grant wrote in the post's caption: 'You wouldn't understand.' 

Followers were quick to comment with the likes of 'Thank you. I needed this laugh tonight' and 'Love this Grant'.
