Scarlett paired the V-neck sweater with a knee-length black skirt featuring a frayed hem.

She rounded out the casual ensemble with a pair of black sandals, and she had her blonde locks tied back in a messy bun. 

The Match Point actress brought along a beige handbag, which she left in her trunk as she filled it with groceries.

She wore a blue surgical-style mask during her grocery store visit to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Scarlett appeared to have left her fiancé Colin Jost, 38, and her daughter Rose Dauriac, six, back home.

She's been dating the SNL funnyman since 2017, and the two got engaged in May of last year.

The ongoing pandemic has temporarily put the kibosh on their plans to wed, though.

While speaking with Andy Cohen last month, Colin said that prohibitions on large gatherings might make it legally impossible to have their wedding for some time.

'This is not the time to get all your elderly, at-risk relatives together in one big group,' the Weekend Update anchor said. 'I don’t know when that moment will be.'

In his new book A Very Punchable Face: A Memoir, Jost recalled how Johansson initially struck him as 'intimidatingly sophisticated' when the first crossed paths on the set of SNL in 2006 when she was hosting and he was still a writer.

'I remember her being beautiful, smart, sweet, and intimidatingly sophisticated,' Jost wrote, hailing the A-list actress for having 'a grace and a smile that I've still never seen in any other human.'

Prior to their relationship, Scarlett was married to Romain Dauriac from 2014–2017, with whom she shares her daughter Rose.

Her first marriage was to her fellow actor Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.
