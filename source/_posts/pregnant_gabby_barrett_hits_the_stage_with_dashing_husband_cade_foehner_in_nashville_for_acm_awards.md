Gabby Barrett hit the stage with her husband Cade Foehner for a performance at the ACM Awards in Nashville.

Although the awards show was broadcast this Wednesday the hot couple's portion was recorded at the Ryman Auditorium on August 25.

Draping her baby bump in a luxurious glittering gold blouse, the 20-year-old sat opposite her husband as he accompanied her on acoustic guitar.

What a team: Gabby Barrett hit the stage with her husband Cade Foehner for a performance at the ACM Awards in Nashville

The Pennsylvania-born songstress was performing her smash hit single I Hope which has hit the top 10 in the Billboard 100.

Her sensational top featured massive robe sleeves that became part of a cape, which flowed to the ground as she sat on her onstage stool.

She teamed the blouse with a pair of skintight black leather trousers, amplifying the sizzling showbiz glamour of her look.

The dynamic duo were first introduced when they were competing against each other on season 16 of American Idol two years ago.

Dream of a duo: Although the awards show was broadcast this Wednesday the hot couple's portion was recorded at the Ryman Auditorium on August 25

While Cade trailed behind at number 21 his future wife managed to sing her way to the third place position though the top prize went to Layla Spring of Kentucky.

However Gabby and Cade gained their romance from their reality show gig and got married last October in his home state of Texas.

Gabby announced in August that she was pregnant with a daughter, just two months after she dropped her debut album Goldmine.

Cade, 24, told People that 'of course, with the pandemic happening, there was this huge amount of time of getting to think and rethink what life was going to be about.'

What an ensemble: Her sensational top featured massive robe sleeves that became part of a cape, which flowed to the ground as she sat on her onstage stool

He revealed: 'So we started trying pretty much at the start of the whole pandemic. It happened pretty quickly. We were expecting it to take a little while, and it seemed like the first try that it happened, so we were just so excited. We were blown away that it worked so quickly. But yes, we were starting to plan on it, for sure.'

The ACM Awards extravaganza blends live and pre-taped segments and be held across three Nashville landmarks, facilitating social distancing.  

One of the venues was the Ryman Auditorium where Gabby and Cade gave their performance and the others were the Grand Ole Opry and Bluebird Cafe.

Remember when: The dynamic duo were first introduced when they were competing against each other on season 16 of American Idol two years ago, where she is pictured

The Grand Ole Opry was celebrating 95 years since its foundation, as marked by Carrie Underwood in a medley of songs by legendary country ladies.

Her barnstorming performance that evening included nods to such icons as Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, Reba McEntire and Loretta Lynn.

Gabby was up for new female artist but lost to Tenille Townes in a category that included Lindsay Ell, Ingrid Andress and Caylee Hammack.
