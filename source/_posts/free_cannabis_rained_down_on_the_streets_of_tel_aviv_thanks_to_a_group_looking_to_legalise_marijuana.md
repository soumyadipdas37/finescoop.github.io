People scrambled to grab free drugs as they rained from the Tel Aviv skies thanks to a group seeking to legalise cannabis.

The Green Drone group dropped hundreds of packets of cannabis onto the streets of the Israeli city.

The group, whose slogan is free love, used a drone to drop the marijuana yesterday over Rabin Square.

Confused people below soon rushed to collect up as many packets of the drug as they could.

 Before it dropped the weed Green Drone had published a hint of its plot on the messaging service Telegram.

The message on Telegram read: 'It's time my dear brothers. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's the green drone, handing out free cannabis from the sky... Enjoy my beloved brothers, this is your pilot brother, making sure we all get some free love.'

Green Drone also indicated that the operation formed part of its celebratory launching of a new delivery system dubbed Rain of Cannabis.

The Telegram message added: 'We're launching the 'rain of cannabis' project, that will include a weekly delivery to different parts of the country of 1 kilo of cannabis divided into free 2 gram bags.'

Current Covid-19 lockdown restrictions have also caused problems for distributing drugs, said the Green Drone team. 

The team's statement said that the situation: 'requires thinking outside the box and coming up with new ways of getting cannabis to consumers' – which they said is what gave birth to the project in the first place. 

The police announced shortly after the incident that it had arrested two suspects in their 30s,who allegedly operated the drone dropping the cannabis.

The distribution of a substance suspected to be dangerous is illegal according to the police in Israel.

The arrested suspects are to be interrogated and then dealt with accordingly.
