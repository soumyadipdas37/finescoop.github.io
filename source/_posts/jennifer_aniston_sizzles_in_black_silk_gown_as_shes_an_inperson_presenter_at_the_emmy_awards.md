Jennifer Aniston sizzled in a black silk gown as she was an in-person presenter at Sunday's virtual Emmy Awards, which were held at the Staples Center with a only a handful of people in attendance amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The perennial A-lister, 51, was clad in a slip-like garment, accessorizing with a diamond necklace and scrappy black heels as she served as a presenter in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

After Catherine O'Hara claimed the prize, Aniston and host Jimmy Kimmel, 52, went to great lengths to make sure the materials on hand were clean with COVID-19 still in play.

Kimmel drenched the envelope with the winner's announcement with Lysol and set it ablaze.

'That's a little extreme, Jimmy,' Jennifer, who was nominated for an Emmy for her work on the Apple TV series The Morning, told Kimmel as he continued to spray the aerosol disinfectant.

The late night stalwart wisecracked, 'You never know where these accountants' hands have been ... now it goes into the basket and we light it up' in order for 'the germs to be burned off.'

Aniston picked up a nearby fire extinguisher and put out the blaze.

Aniston, who's nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series Sunday, in 2002 won an Emmy in the category, for her portrayal of Rachel Green on the 90s NBC hit Friends. 

She's been nominated a total of seven times.

Earlier in the day, Aniston was seen relaxing in her pajamas with a facial mask cleanser, writing, 'Emmys prep... in my other mask.'

Aniston was previously in a commercial for this year's award show, which did not have a red carpet or live audience in an effort to quell the spread of the coronavirus. 

She told viewers that 'things are going to be quite different' for the 2020 edition and said the proceedings would be 'one unpredictable night' featuring '138 stars from 114 locations across 10 countries.'

In July, the show was moved to be held virtually with the pandemic continuing.
