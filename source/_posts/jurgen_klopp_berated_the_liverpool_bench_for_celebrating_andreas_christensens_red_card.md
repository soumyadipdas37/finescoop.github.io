Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has criticised his players for celebrating Andreas Christensen's red card.

Chelsea defender Christensen was dismissed just before half time for hauling down Sadio Mane. Although he was initially given a yellow card, Christensen was sent off after referee Paul Tierney consulted the pitchside monitor. 

Some of the players on the Liverpool bench were jubilant at the decision as they clapped and cheered, but Klopp didn't take kindly to their actions.

As reported by Julien Laurens, Klopp turned around from the touchline and shouted: “Are you crazy? We never ever do that, ok?”.

Although the dismissal of Christensen was a major positive for Liverpool after an intense tactical battle in the first half, Klopp was eager not to celebrate the decision.
