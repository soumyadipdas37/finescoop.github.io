An Adelaide YouTube gamer imported animated Japanese child porn and filmed himself having sex with a doll while children watched online, a court heard.

Shane Andrew Lunnay, 35, pleaded guilty in the District Court on Tuesday to multiple counts of possessing and controlling child abuse material and importing prohibited goods.

The court heard he was in possession of photographs and videos including some showing children under the age of 14, The Advertiser reported.

Judge Geraldine Davison said Lunnay's obsession with the animated material, called hentai, may have formed a 'foundation' for his use of child abuse material.

'Is this another example, perhaps, that one shouldn't consider that anime, or hentai material, is harmless, victimless,' she said.

She described his bedroom as a 'fantasy world' with posters of young animated girls plastered on every wall. 

The YouTube gamer was not directly charged for live-streaming himself having sex with what appeared to be a doll while aware children were watching him.  

His lawyer, Andrew Culshaw, conceded his client lived in an 'unhealthy, deviant and illegal fantasy world' but he has since sought therapy. 

Prosecutor Pantelia Marinakis told the court Lunnay had confessed to a psychologist he had no interest in child exploitation material. 

He would use his YouTube channel, Radical Dreamer Shane-O, to post clips of himself playing video games and talking about his collections. 

The 35-year-old is due to be sentenced in late September.
