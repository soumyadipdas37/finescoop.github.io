Matthew Perry has snapped up a $6 million home in the Pacific Palisades, scaling back from the $14.95 million Malibu bachelor pad he recently put on the market.

The 3,000 square foot home was built in 1965 as modest ranch-style house, but has since undergone an extensive transformation, according to Dirt.com, which reported news of the sale.

The stunning four bedroom, four and a half bathroom home is perched upon a hillside overlooking the ocean, with many of the rooms featuring a view of the Pacific.

The modern house is equipped with a pool and fire pit, along with massive pocket sliding doors for access to the backyard.

The luxurious home comes with all the usual chic furnishings, including oak floors, ceiling lights, and a massive walk-in closet.

The open floor plan allows for effortless flow between the living room, dining room, and kitchen, which all blend harmoniously together.

Matthew's quaint chef's kitchen comes with a counter top, oven, pot organizer, and wine rack.

The sale comes not long after Matthew listed his stunning Malibu home for $14.95 million and slashed the price of his Century City condo.

The high rise home, listed with Greg Holcomb and Cassandra Petersen of Compass realty company, is described as a 'mansion in the sky.'
