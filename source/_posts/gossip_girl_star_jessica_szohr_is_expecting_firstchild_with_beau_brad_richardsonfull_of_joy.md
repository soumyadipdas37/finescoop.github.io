She had on a scalloped tank-style bodysuit and her lengthy brunette hair was styled into a wavy half up half down 'do that elegantly flowed down her back.

Before unveiling the baby news to her 762,000 followers, the actress teased her pregnancy shoot on her Instagram Story. 'Let life surprise you,' the post read. 

Jessica and Brad reportedly began dating sometime in late 2018 or early 2019, but did not go public with their romance until March of 2019, according to Us Weekly.

Richardson, who plays center for the Arizona Coyotes, was previously married to a woman by the name of Lauren Hunt from 2014 until their divorce in 2019.
