An Australian is behind bars in Bali accused of working as a drug courier for a British man who police allege is a 'dealer and distributor' on the holiday island.   

Aaron Wayne Coyle, 44, from Perth, was arrested outside his Seminyak boarding house on Wednesday. Police allegedly found 1.2 grams of meth inside his home.

They allege Coyle was working for 32-year-old British man Collum Park.

'We allege that the Brit is the drugs dealer. Meanwhile the Australian, we allege, that he is the courier,' Denpasar Police Chief Jansen Avitus Panjaitan said.

Denpasar Police allege Coyle (back right) acted as a drug runner for British man Collum Park, 32, (centre) 

'They are [allegedly] working on storing and distributing it by planting the drugs somewhere. We allege they are part of a syndicate.' 

Both men are being held by Denpasar police after being charged with drug offences which carry 12 and 20 years in prison respectively. 

Police will allege Coyle was paid 200,000 IDR, roughly AUS$20, each time he transported drugs for Park. 

The Australian's family said he moved to Bali in early 2020 on a five-year visa and was there to deliver packages to people in need during the pandemic.

Coyle allegedly told police he had only delivered drugs twice for Park and received AUS$20 as a one-off payment, Nine News reported. 

Indonesia has very strict drug laws and convicted traffickers are often executed by a firing squad. 

More than 150 people are on death row, mostly for drug crimes, and about a third of them are foreigners. 

At the time of his arrest police allege the Coyle had 1.23 grams of methamphetamine in his room and was preparing to make a delivery (drugs allegedly seized during arrests pictured)
