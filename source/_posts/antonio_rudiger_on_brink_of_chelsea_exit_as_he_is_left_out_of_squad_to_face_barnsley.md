Antonio Rudiger’s Chelsea career under Frank Lampard appears to be drawing to a close after he was omitted from the squad for the second successive match.

Having been left out of the match day party to face Liverpool on Sunday, Sportsmail understands Rudiger has once again been left out of Lampard’s plans for Wednesday night’s Carabao Cup clash against Barnsley.

And it is looking increasingly likely that the Germany international will leave Stamford Bridge before the October 5 transfer deadline.

Paris Saint-Germain are interested in taking the central defender during this window.

A season long loan appears the most likely scenario for Rudiger.

Despite losing his place in Lampard’s plans, Rudiger maintains his reputation as one of the most accomplished defenders in Europe and will not be short of takers if Chelsea - as appears likely - will make him available.

Rudiger has two years left to run on his current deal but has not been approached about signing an extension.

That means he effectively becomes a free agent in January 2022 - something Chelsea will be acutely aware of.
