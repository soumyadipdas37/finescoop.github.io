Andy Murray has shown off his lighter side by testing out the new 'relaxing zone' at the US Open... and getting completely furious in the process.

Murray took the Amazon Prime cameras into the new area for players at Flushing Meadows, where a series of activities are set up in order to take their minds off the pressures of the tennis tournament.

Crazy golf and cornhole are among the small games players can put their mind to, though the competitor in Murray soon surged to the surface and prompted several swear word-laden rants.

In the short segment hilariously titled 'Andycam: players relaxing', Murray can be seen cutting short crazy golf putts while yelling to himself: 'Ah just f******* hit it man.'

Ever the competitor, Murray's fury boiled over after he missed a simple close-range putt

Moving onto cornhole, Murray completely misses the target before reflexively yelling: 'Oh that's terrible f****** hell!'. 

The Scotsman could be seen shaking his head angrily before smiling to himself when turning back to the rolling cameras.

Murray then hilariously concluded the clip by stating, completely unconvincingly: 'And yeah, it's just a little way the players can relax.'

The complex also includes an outdoor gym area and a series of basketball hoops for players to enjoy during their time away from the courts.

It has been far from a relaxing for Murray however, after the tennis legend was pushed to the limit in his opening US Open clash with Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka.

Murray looked destined for defeat after losing the first two sets to a seemingly more energetic opponent.

But the former world No.1 found something deep within and managed to surge back into the reckoning, winning the third set to take the match the full distance.

It was Murray's first Grand Slam singles match in 596 days, though the tennis icon finally managed to shake off the rust when it really mattered.

Murray returns to action in the second round on Friday, when he meets Canadian Felix Auger Aliassime. 

Murray this week revealed the motivation behind his comeback to Grand Slam tennis came in the form of a surgeon, who told him he was finished at the elite level of sport.

‘There is one person in particular that helped me,’ Murray said. ‘It was the surgeon who told me after Wimbledon in 2017 that I didn’t have long left and I could have surgery - resurfacing or hip replacement - but I wouldn’t play professional sport again.

‘It was weird timing, I actually bumped into him the morning after I had the hip resurfacing (early last year) when I took my first steps with the crutches. I walked past him in the hallway and he smiled at me and said to my wife, “I told him he was going to have to do this”.

‘It just really got me. I was not happy. I would say that was the thing that gave me the biggest motivation because at that moment I had obviously been going through a difficult time, had the operation and I felt that there was a bit of smugness to what he told me,' Murray added.
