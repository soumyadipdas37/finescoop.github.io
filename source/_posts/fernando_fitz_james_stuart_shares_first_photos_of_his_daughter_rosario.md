Spanish aristocrat Fernando Fitz-James Stuart and his wife Sofía Palazuelo have shared the first photos of their newborn daughter. 

Fernando, 29, Duke of Huéscar and heir apparent of the dukedom of Alba, and radiant wife Sofía took part in a public photocall in Madrid to introduce their daughter Rosario to the world. 

The couple, who tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in 2018, welcomed Rosario at Madrid's Hospital Nuestra Señora del Rosario last week. 

The baby was named in honour of Fernando's grandmother, the late Duchess of Alba, María del Rosario Cayetana Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Francisca Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva, who was known as Spain's richest woman.  

Welcome to the world! Spanish aristocrat Fernando Fitz-James Stuart and his wife Sofía Palazuelo have shared the first photos of their newborn daughter

Proud parents: Fernando, 29, Duke of Huéscar and heir apparent of the dukedom of Alba, and radiant wife Sofía took part in a public photocall in Madrid to introduce their daughter Rosario 

News of the birth comes just days after his brother, Carlos Fitz-James Stuart y Solís, Count of Osorno, 28, announced his engagement to his heiress his girlfriend Belén Corsini de Lacalle after two years of dating.   

Fernando and Sofía, who worked in luxury fashion PR before marrying, wed at Fernando's 18th century family estate, Liria Palace in Madrid, in October 2018. 

The couple were joined by no less than 750 wedding guests including the likes of Spain's Emeritus Queen Sofia, and designer Agatha Ruiz de la Prada.

Following the ceremony the newly weds hosted an aperitivo and long lunch on the same estate serving beer from the family's own brewery La Casa de Alba.

Precious: The couple chose to obscure Rosario's face in order to protect her privacy

The couple performed their first dance to a waltz before their guests joined them on the dance floor and partied until the early hours. 

It is no surprise that the wedding was a lavish affair with the groom being the grandson of the late Duchess of Alba, who was known as Spain's richest woman

Worth an estimated £2.2billion, the Spanish duchess was one of Europe's wealthiest aristocrats when she passed away in November 2014 at her Seville residence, Duenas Palace.

The baby was named in honour of Fernando's grandmother, the late Duchess of Alba, María del Rosario Cayetana Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Francisca Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva, who was known as Spain's richest woman.

Friends, relatives and well-wishers paid their respects to the duchess, also known as 'Cayetana', after she died following a battle with pneumonia.

Her husband Alfonso Diez, who was 24 years her junior, is thought not to have received any of her fortune, which included an impressive property portfolio, 50,000 pieces of artwork and 18,000 rare books, after he signed a document renouncing any claim to her wealth prior to their marriage in October 2011.

Instead, the Duchess - who is a direct royal descent from King James II of England - left her entire estate to her six children, with them each receiving a palace, as well as thousands of acres of land. Her eight grandchildren are also said to have inherited a substantial chunk of her estate. 

Fernando, 29, Duke of Huéscar and heir apparent of the dukedom of Alba, was by Sofía's side when she gave birth to their daughter Rosario at Madrid's Hospital Nuestra Señora del Rosario. Pictured, the couple at their stunning wedding in Madrid in October 2018

A relative of Winston Churchill, the duchess shared toys with England's future Queen Elizabeth while living in England as a girl.

She was 14 times a Spanish grandee, five times a duchess, once a countess-duchess, 18 times a marchioness, 18 times a countess and once a viscountess, according to the entry.

With her cloud of white hair and face moulded by plastic surgery, she was rarely out of the Spanish gossip magazines.

'If they forget you, you are nobody,' she once told one of the Spanish celebrity magazines of which she was a fixture.

The 13th Duchess of Alba was a muse of artist Francisco Goya in the 18th century and is rumoured to be the subject of 'La Maja Desnuda', his famous portrait of a reclining nude which hangs in Madrid's Prado gallery.
