New rules were enforced over the August bank holiday weekend in the UK, to attempt to put a stop to mass gatherings amid the COVID-19 crisis.

But this didn't stop Love Island's Jack Fincham from attending a massive party at The Swan in West Malling, Kent.

The pub threw a huge event - charging revelers £120 each for the pleasure - promising to adhere to social distancing and the pandemic public safety guidelines.

However, Jack, 26, not only attended the event, but filmed himself and all the attendees, plastering it across his social media accounts.

Implicating the pub and its guests, Jack inadvertantly identified numerous culprits, now eligible to be fined £10,000.

Jack was seen kissing an unknown brunette woman on the cheek while they partied under a marquee, despite recently confirming his relationship with Connie O'Hara.

Jack - who has also recently welcomed a child, but with a different woman - was also seen hugging his friends as they drank and danced at the ticketed event.

Evidence: Jack, 26, not only attended the event, but filmed himself and all the attendees, plastering it across his social media accounts

The Swan had posted the following message to Facebook ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only'

The ex-reality personality flouted COVID-19 rules, along with the other attendees, who were all seen crammed into the event despite the 2m+ rules that are still in place in England.

The Swan had posted the following message to Facebook ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only.

'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point.

'We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe.'

Breaking the rules: 'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point. We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe,' was also promised by The Swan

Oh dear! Yet the footage shared by Jack - who has 2.1 million Instagram followers - saw the exact opposite of what the event planners had promised

Yet the footage shared by Jack - who has 2.1 million Instagram followers - saw the exact opposite of what the event planners had promised.

In a multitude of clips from the day-into-evening event, the attendees were seen in a mass gathering in the centre of the marquee, dancing closely together, with no social distancing rules being followed at all.

The promise to keep attendees to their own tables had, evidently, been abandonned by this point.

MailOnline has approached The Swan and Jack's reps for comment.

The party - which featured food, a DJ, tables intended for no more than eight people, and unlimited alcohol - comes after new rules to crack down on mass gatherings came into force on Friday - leading to £90,000-worth of fines issued by Sunday night.

The regulations - with were put in place ahead of the bank holiday weekend - gives police the power to hand out £10,000 fines. 

Current government guidelines state people from different households can meet in an outdoor space in a group of up to six. It is also acceptable for people to meet in a  a group of two households in any location.

One of the biggest infringements to have taken part this weekend was the massive illegal lockdown rave in Wales, which was finally shut down by police on Monday.

Some 3,000 revellers descended on an area of woodland near the village of Banwen in the early hours of Sunday morning - with 400 ravers still at the site by Monday evening.

But South Wales Police managed to shut down the rave after around 70 officers, assisted by Dyfed-Powys Police and the British Transport Police, were called out to the wood to execute a dispersal order.

Summons have been issued to 22 ravers, which could see them slapped with £10,000 fines under the new rules.

Assistant chief constable David Thorne wrote on Twitter: 'Rave at Banwen is over! South Wales Police, Dyfed-Powys Police [and] British Transport Police teams have done a fantastic job this weekend of clearing this huge area from the 3,000 strong illegal gathering. Thank you to all involved.'  

Locals voiced complaints about the illegal music festival after rubbish was dumped and ravers defecated over the site.

Elsewhere, rowdy revellers confronted a line of riot shield-wielding police officers in a Norfolk forest on Sunday night, after authorities tried to shut down their 500-person rave.

Crowds of police officers wearing helmets and hi-vis jackets moved in to break up the 'well-established and planned' all-night unlicensed music event in Thetford Forest.

Earlier, West Yorkshire Police said eight people were fined £10,000 after several parties across Headingley and Burley on Saturday and into the early hours of Sunday. 

One man was fined £10,000 for a Headingley house party. Another gathering in the same area lead to four people being slapped with the enormous fee, Sky News reports.

Two DJs were fined £10,000 each in Burley; and Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers received the first £10,000 fine in London for an illegal gathering after he organised a march claiming coronavirus is a hoax.

The 73-year-old meteorologist led more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally in Trafalgar Square on Saturday.

Mr Corbyn, the older brother of the former Labour leader, was seen being hauled off by officers after the event and his Twitter account has since confirmed he was slapped with the colossal fine and 'held for ten hours.'
