Jurgen Klopp has insisted the impending £25million arrival of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich will not impact the future of any Liverpool player amid Georginio Wijnaldum's links to Barcelona.

The Premier League champions are poised to announced the completion of a four-year deal for the Spanish midfielder on Friday.

After completing a medical, Thiago will put pen to paper on a four-year deal and will wear the vacant No 6 shirt for Klopp's side.

Liverpool are set to confirm the £25m signing of the highly-rated Bayern Munich midfielder

Many thought Thiago's arrival on Merseyside would spell the end for Wijnaldum, who is wanted by new Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman and out of contract next summer.

But Klopp insists that is not the case, saying: 'If it (signing Thiago) happens it has no impact on anybody's future in a negative way.

'Nobody has to leave. I can say that. No impact.' 

Wijnaldum had ‘positive’ discussions with Klopp after returning from international duty last week and while Liverpool would look to command a similar fee from Barcelona as Bayern want from Thiago, the situations are not linked.

Klopp holds Wijnaldum in the highest regard but Thiago has different qualities to Liverpool’s other midfielders and the manager believes he will add another dimension to their play. 

Liverpool will pay Bayern a minimum of £20m over the next four years — the length of contract Thiago will sign.

The move for Thiago is not linked directly to the future of Barcelona target Gini Wijnaldum

Should Liverpool win the Premier League or Champions League again before 2024, they will have to pay Bayern another £5m and there are other bonuses should he win any individual honours during his time at Anfield.

Klopp remained coy on any developments with Thiago's deal, which is expected to be announced on Friday.

The Germans added: 'It's not official until it's announced and I am not the announcer. 

'It looks quite promising. My hands are tied. For all the supporters it's worth keeping an eye on LFC channels over the day.

'I would prefer to speak about his impact after it's announced but the things I'll say if it happens are obvious. It is not something somebody has to discover.

'It's tricky for me. It's not announced, nothing is announced. That's all I can say.'

Liverpool have also contacted Watford to register their interest in Ismaila Sarr, the Senegal forward, who performed so well against them last season and is valued by the Championship club at more than £35m.
