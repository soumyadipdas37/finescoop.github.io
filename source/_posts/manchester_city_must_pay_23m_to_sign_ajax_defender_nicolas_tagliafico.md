Nicolas Tagliafico will cost Manchester City in the region of £23million should they firm up interest in the Ajax defender.

Pep Guardiola is hoping to add a left back to his ranks before Monday's transfer deadline, a move dependent on whether Aleks Zinchenko leaves the Etihad Stadium.

Tagliafico is understood to be on City's radar, although they are yet to make contact with the Dutch champions.

Ajax are resistant to losing a fourth senior player in the same summer but the 28-year-old is keen on a move to the Premier League.

Bayern Munich's David Alaba, who currently faces contract uncertainty at the Allianz Arena, is a player City have also held interest in.

An attacking full back, Tagliafico signed from Independiente two years ago and was impressive during Ajax's run to the Champions League semi-finals.

City have already spent more than £100m on defenders this summer after landing Nathan Ake from Bournemouth and Benfica's Ruben Dias.
