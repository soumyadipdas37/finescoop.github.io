Bachelor Locky Gilbert has so far rejected 21 women on the show, including blonde beauty Steph Harper. 

And on Friday, the 26-year-old special needs teacher showed Locky what he was missing with a bikini picture posted to Instagram.

But it was Stephanie's lengthy caption that stole the show, which contained several swipes at her former lover.

'It wasn't everything I wanted': The Bachelor's Steph Harper (pictured) took a swipe at Locky Gilbert after failing to get a rose this week on the show 

'Look if something doesn't bring you energy, inspiration or a goooood time. It doesn't belong in your life,' she captioned the post, followed by a winking face emoji.

The caption and emoji seem to suggest the 'it' Steph was referring to was actually a 'him' - Locky. 

Steph's caption, titled 'new beginnings', went into detail about her journey from being rejected on a national dating show to moving to Queensland from Victoria.

'Bach was a huge journey for me, one that I became very invested in. It wasn't everything I wanted but it was everything I needed,' Steph wrote. 

'I gave it my all and I've come away with absolutely no regrets! I didn't find love with a partner but after picking myself up and putting myself back together I've gained a lot of self-love. 

'I got to meet so many beautiful women who have forever spots in my heart now and I learned so much about myself in the process. I've since wandered up to Queensland and have started a new chapter.' 

The 26-year-old explained she spent two weeks in hotel quarantine in Queensland and is now free to go to the beach, which is where she took her photo.  

Last rose: Locky (pictured) gave his final rose to Bella Varelis on Thursday night, eliminating Steph and Maddy Carver in the process 

Steph was sent home from The Bachelor on Wednesday night along with fellow teacher Maddy Carver after they both failed to get a rose. 

Maddy and Steph's eliminations occurred after an intense showdown between Juliette and Locky during the show's cocktail party.

However, it didn't go according to plan and the 34-year-old stylist was immediately evicted from The Bachelor mansion. 

The remaining women competing for Locky's love include Bella Varelis, Irena Srbinovska, Izzy Sharman-Firth, Kaitlyn Hoppe and intruder Bec Cvilikas.
