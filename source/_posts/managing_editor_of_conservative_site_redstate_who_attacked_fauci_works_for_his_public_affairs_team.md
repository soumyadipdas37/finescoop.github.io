The managing editor of conservative website RedState, who published under a pseudonym multiple articles attacking Dr Anthony Fauci, has been revealed as a press officer working for Fauci's agency.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases confirmed on Monday that William B. Crews had resigned, after his alias was uncovered.

Crews was writing under the name Streiff, and, fervently opposed to COVID-19 guidance on face masks, called his boss an 'attention-grabbing and media-whoring mask Nazi'.

Crews' identity was first reported by Daily Beast.

'NIAID first learned of this matter this morning, and Mr. Crews has informed us of his intention to retire,' a spokesman told CNN. 

'We have no further comments on this as it is a personnel matter.' 

By Monday afternoon Crews had been removed from NIAID's internal directory. 

On his Twitter account, Crews describes himself as: 'Managing Editor at RedState.com, Former Infantry officer, CGSC grad, Army staff. Pronouns: F***/You.'
