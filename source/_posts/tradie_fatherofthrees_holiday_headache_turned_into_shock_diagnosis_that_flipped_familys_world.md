A builder's wife and children have been left devastated after he was diagnosed with a rare illness just hours after complaining of a headache during a family holiday.  

Rob Turner suffered 'severe pain in his head' while on a car trip with his wife Gabrielle and children Estelle, Frankie and Otis in Karumba in North Queensland on Thursday.

The father-of-three got out of his car and collapsed in front of his family before becoming paralysed.

He was airlifted to intensive care in Townsville Hospital where the family received earth-shattering news.

Doctors revealed Mr Turner had a rare bleed on the brain which would require surgery and an indefinite bout of rehabilitation.

Mrs Turner said the shocking news had rocked the family.

'It is overwhelming to think Rob has been a ticking time bomb since he was born and we didn’t even know,' she told 7News.

'One thing that is certain is that we will never take another day for granted.'

Mr Turner runs a small carpentry business in the Atherton Tablelands near Cairns and is a popular figure in his local community.

His family have relocated to Townsville to be by his side after the incident and are facing financial struggles now Mr Turner cannot work.

The family have endured dramatic health struggles before, with eldest daughter Estelle having urgent open-heart surgery when she was just four-weeks-old.

A GoFundMe has been started to help the family pay for Mr Turner's medical bills and help with family costs.

'Rob is a fighter and his condition is slowly improving, but there is a long and uncertain road ahead,' an update from friend Caitlin Francis on the GoFundMe reads.

'It is not clear how long it will take for Rob to recover, or what this will look like.'

As of Tuesday evening, the fundraiser has grossed more than $76,000.

Mrs Turner said the community support the family had received had been incredible.

'Rob would be blown away if he knew how this has affected everyone,' she said.
