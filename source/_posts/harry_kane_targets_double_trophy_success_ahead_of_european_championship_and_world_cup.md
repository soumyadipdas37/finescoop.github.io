Harry Kane recognises the next two years could define his career as England bid to win the European Championship and World Cup. 

The forward is yet to win a major trophy in his career and believes Euro 2020 - postponed until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic - represents a 'real opportunity' to claim silverware.

The World Cup then kicks off in Qatar in November 2022 and the England captain has stressed the significance of these two competitions. 

Harry Kane recognises the outcome of England's next two tournaments could define his career

'I am 27 and there are two massive tournaments coming up in two years and it is a real opportunity for me and a team to win something with England.' Kane said.

'In my head, I have many more years to come but these next two are really important.

'I have to perform and, in the last couple of years, I have been hindered by injury but I can get to the numbers I know I can with goals and assists.'

Kane scored six goals to win the Golden Boot at the 2018 World Cup but struggled to find such consistency after returning from Russia.

The forward suffered a more recent setback when he travelled to the Bahamas and subsequently missed the start of Tottenham's pre-season preparations due to the island being named on the quarantine list.

'It wasn't ideal but you have to adapt to it and get on with it,' Kane continued.

'But in training I've felt fine, I feel sharp, I'm ready to go, so I guess we'll just assess it game by game and see how I feel.

'Looking back now I don't think it's done me any harm having that extra week away, being refreshed with the family.

'I guess time will tell but I know one thing – I'm ready for the season, I'm excited for the season, I'm feeling as good as I have done for a while.

'I felt really sharp in the last nine games with Spurs and another few weeks rest and a couple of weeks quarantine has left me in a good place and I am itching to get back. My body is in a good place.'

England kick off their Nations League campaign against Iceland in Reykjavic on Saturday before travelling to Copenhagen to take on Denmark on Tuesday.
