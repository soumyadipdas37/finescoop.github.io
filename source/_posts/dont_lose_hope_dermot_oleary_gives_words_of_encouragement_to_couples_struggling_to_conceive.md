Dermot O'Leary has discussed the difficulties he and wife Dee Koppang O'Leary had in becoming parents, advising other couples to not 'lose hope'.

The TV presenter, 47, and his other half, 41, welcomed their son Kasper in June and Dermot told how his work getting cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant he got to spend 'special time' with the tot.

Speaking to The Sun's Fabulous magazine, Dermot gave words of encouragement to couples struggling to conceive after Dee previously admitted they had a 'rocky road' to becoming parents.

Honest: Dermot O'Leary, 47, has discussed the difficulties he and wife Dee Koppang O'Leary, 41, had in becoming parents, advising other couples to not 'lose hope'

Dermot said: 'Don't lose hope. Just keep going and you'll find resolution one way or another, whether it's through adoption or IVF or whatever.

'Because if you really want to be a parent and you want to bring a kid up in a loving, nurturing and supportive household, then you should do your utmost to do so.

'And I know it's very easy to say these things, because none of that is science. But there are always ways.'

Dermot added that one day, when Dee is ready, she will share their journey to becoming parents in the hopes it will give hope to other couples.

The X Factor host also discussed life during lockdown and said it allowed the pair to have a lot of time with their newborn while he otherwise would have been in America filming the judges' houses portion of the series. 

Dermot added that while the ongoing pandemic has been an 'unsettling' time, getting to spend his days with Kasper was the silver lining. 

The TV star admitted he felt anxious in the early days of the pandemic as Britain was moving towards lockdown but, like everyone, learned to adjust. 

Also in the interview, Dermot revealed he and Dee found out the sex of their baby early on but kept it a secret from friends and family. 

Encouragement: Giving advice to couples, Dermot said: 'Don't lose hope. Just keep going and you'll find resolution one way or another, whether it's through adoption or IVF or whatever'

In his Instagram post announcing Kasper's birth, Dermot penned: 'Welcome to the world baby Koppang O'Leary... We're delighted to announce that we've had a baby!

'A little boy born on Tuesday 23rd June 2020 (Sankthansaften / Midsummer for you Norwegians) at 8.19am, weighing in at 6lb 13oz.

'Enjoying the cuddles in the newborn bubble... cats yet to be 100% convinced. Lots of love, Dermot & Dee x.' 

Dermot tied the knot with Dee in 2012 after ten years together at St Mary's Church in Chiddingstone, Kent.

He added: 'Because if you really want to be a parent and you want to bring a kid up in a loving, nurturing and supportive household, then you should do your utmost to do so'

It proved to be a star-studded occasion with guests including Holly Willoughby, James Corden and Bear Grylls.

In 2015 Dermot hinted that he was ready to start a family with wife Dee, telling Fabulous Magazine: 'I definitely want kids, but I've got a very busy wife with a very busy life.

'It's not fair for me to say, ''I want kids now''. I do want kids with my wife, but I want them when we both think it's the right thing to happen.' 

Dermot and Dee met in 2002 when they worked for the same TV production company and got engaged in New York in December 2011.
