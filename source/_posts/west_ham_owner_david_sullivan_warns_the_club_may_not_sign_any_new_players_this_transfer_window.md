David Sullivan has warned West Ham may end the transfer window without any new additions.

Co-owner Sullivan delivered a downbeat update on the club's prospects of bringing in fresh faces before next month's deadline and about their lack of funds for this window.

And he claimed one problem is they have already 'chased the dream the last two years' under previous manager Manuel Pellegrini and director of football Mario Husillos and being left with 'a pile of players who haven't impacted the club.'

West Ham were hit by a backlash from their players, led by captain Mark Noble, supporters after selling academy product Grady Diangana to West Brom for £18million.

They attempted to justify the sale with a promise that the money would be reinvested with manager David Moyes hoping to bolster his defence.

Among their targets is Burnley's James Tarkowski who they have so far failed to prise away. They have also made a bid worth up to £33m for St Etienne's centre back Wesley Fofana, who has also been targeted by Leicester.

'I cannot say for sure we are going to sign anybody. As each day passes, I get more depressed,' Sullivan said, in a talkSPORT interview that was not well-received by club insiders or supporters.

'You can't pay double what you value a player at. We haven't got the money. The club will go bankrupt. These are difficult times and we have to be sensible.

'We have a number of bids in for a number of players, but teams don't want to lose them; key players at decent sized clubs, outside the UK. So whether we get any of these players I do not know.'
