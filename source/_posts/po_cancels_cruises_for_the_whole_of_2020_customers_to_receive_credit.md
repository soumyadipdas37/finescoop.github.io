P&O Cruises has cancelled all its 2020 sailings.

The holiday group has extended the suspension of sailings until early next year due to coronavirus.

The UK’s largest cruise line said the decision was taken due to ‘evolving restrictions on travel’.

Land ahoy: P&O Cruises has extended the suspension of sailings until early next year due to coronavirus

All Caribbean cruises are cancelled until the end of January 2021.

Sailings to and from Southampton are suspended until various dates throughout February 2021, apart from those involving ships Arcadia and Aurora which were already cancelled until the spring. 

The firm had previously cancelled sailings until November 12. 

President Paul Ludlow said: ‘With evolving restrictions on travel from the UK, unfortunately it is necessary to cancel these itineraries.’ 

Customers affected will receive credit for a future sailing worth 125 per cent of the cost of their original trip. They can also request a cash refund.
