Shay Mitchell's been working hard to promote her Beis travel brand as of late.

But the 33-year-old actress proved her range as she took center stage on a new Revlon commercial filming in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The raven haired beauty flaunted her toned figure in pistachio colored shorts and a white cropped top while on set.

The Pretty Little Liars alum teamed her casual look with black Nike slides as she was spotted on set downtown. 

She left her dark locks down in loose curls flowing down her back as she donned a full glam makeup look with her cheekbones accentuated through contour. 

Shay is a brand ambassador for the beauty giant and was spotted working with a filming crew on the streets.

Shay has been enjoying an easy coronavirus lockdown. While she's been anchored in LA, the star has taken small trips to see her family in Canada since she gave birth to daughter Atlas just eight-months ago.

She shares her little one with partner Matte Babel. And while the pair are going strong the actress said that she's in no rush to walk down the aisle.

Talking to ET last month, she said: 'A lot of people ask, it's never been something I really cared for,' she said of the prospect of marriage.

'And I love weddings, love weddings. I can watch them all day long. I love attending, I love being a part of my friends' [weddings], anybody's to be quite honest.

Hard working: Shay is notoriously a hard worker, as she worked practically up to the day she gave birth to her daughter Atlas eight months ago and vowed she wouldn't take  maternity leave

'It's just not something I care for for myself and it's something that Matte and I have spoken about,' she explained. 

The Dollface actress clarified that she was leading the way on delaying an engagement, though Matte didn't seem to mind.

'He's been like, 'You sure?' And I'm like, 'Yeah, we work so well right now.' It's great and this dynamic just works for us.

'It may not always be the correct way but it works. That's how I sort of have to go, you know, that's how I do it,' she added.

Taking her time: Shay revealed to ET that an engagement isn't on her mind at the moment. 'A lot of people ask, it's never been something I really cared for,' she said
