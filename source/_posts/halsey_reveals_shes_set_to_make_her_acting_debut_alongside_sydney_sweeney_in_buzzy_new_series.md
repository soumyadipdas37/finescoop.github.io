They first teamed up on the music video for her song Graveyard last year.

In the images, the Without Me songstress posed in a lovely sheer brown two-piece set from the label Inamorata by Emily Ratajkowski, with her dark hair done in cornrow braids.

Sydney complemented her friend in an orange two-piece set from the same fashion label, at one point sporting retro Seventies-style specs.

The actress, most known for her role as delicate and sensual teen Cassie Howard in the hit HBO series Euphoria, also held a video camera in one frame, which Halsey posed in front of with her lips pursed in a kiss.

The pair of beauties also lounged on a purple love seat with Halsey holding an art book about American artist Donald Judd.

In her caption, the Edison, New Jersey-born diva identified several key players involved in their new project, including writer-director Annabelle Attanasio and Big Little Lies director Jean-Marc Vallée, who's set to co-produce The Players Table.

It was announced some weeks ago that Sweeney was involved in the project both as star and producer, through her nascent production company Fifty-Fifty Films.

The new series is based on Jessica Goodman’s bestselling debut novel They Wish They Were Us, following a secret society of students at an exclusive Long Island prep school embroiled in the death of a friend three years prior.

Halsey and Sweeney met and hit it off on the set of the music video for hit track Graveyard, which went on to be nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. 

The news comes after last Friday's report that Halsey was has started a relationship with actress Cara Delevingne, three months after their respective exes G-Eazy and Ashley Benson got together.
