A man in California was killed Tuesday after being run over by his own work van as he tried to stop it from being stolen from his driveway.  

Jose DeJesus Berrelleza, 33, died after running to stop the theft as he was getting ready for work at 6.20am but fell to the ground and was run over by the van. 

He was talking to his father when he noticed the van being taken away from his home in the 100 block of South Melinda Circle.  

Three suspects were found in the van later in the day about 1.5 miles from Berrelleza’s home and arrested, according to the Los Angeles Times.

A GoFundMe set up in Berrelleza's honor has raised almost $27,000 as of Friday morning

'On the early morning of Tuesday, September 22, 2020 Jesus was outside talking with his Dad as usual before they both parted their way to work,' said a GoFundMe set up in his honor. 

'It was their quality time together when these individuals took him from us. He was only 33 years old. He was a strong and hard working individual always looking out for his family, especially his daughter. He had lots of plans for them.

'The best memories she will cherish were their wild camping trips. Jesus was adventurous and was teaching his daughter to be adventurous and brave just like him,' it adds. 

Berrelleza was talking to his father when he realized the van was being stolen and ran out

'An 8-year old that will no longer build new memories with her Papa. Her Papa is no longer here to provide and fight for her. Jesus was hard working and dedicated to his family. 

'He will forever be missed and we will forever hold him close to our hearts. We ask for your support to please share his story to help fight for justice.' 

As of Friday morning, the GoFundMe has raised almost $27,000.   

Anaheim police say the suspects, all Anaheim residents, did not know the victim prior to the incident. 

They were unsure who was behind the wheel when Berrelleza was hit.
