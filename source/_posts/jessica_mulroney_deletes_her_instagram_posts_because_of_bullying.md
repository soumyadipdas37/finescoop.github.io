Jessica Mulroney has revealed that she sometimes deletes Instagram posts because she's 'tired' of looking at the amount of 'bullying and hatred' she's had to put up with for three years.

The stylist, 40, from Toronto, penned the comment  just one week after she deleted a throwback snap of one of her twin sons at Meghan Markle's wedding, after initially posting it a week earlier amid reports of a fallout with the Duchess of Sussex, 39.

The recent Instagram post reads: 'People often ask why I delete certain posts. The amount of bullying and hatred I've had to put up with for three years...I'm tired of looking at it. Be kind. Be gracious. 

'We are grown ups...stop acting like teenagers. Real women don't put down other women.'

Jessica Mulroney shared a snap of one of her twin sons, Brian, at Meghan Markle's, 39, wedding two weeks ago, but deleted the snap the following week

The stylist first shared the sweet image of her son on Instagram two weeks ago, writing: 'When I feel dark and grey, I see this and it all goes away.'

She later amended the caption, changing it to: 'I see this and pure joy.'   

The post was thought to be to be a further attempt from Jessica to show she remains good friends with the former actress - who now lives with Prince Harry, 35, in Santa Barbara. 

But the mysterious disappearance of the photo from her Instagram page added fuel to the fire of rumours of a rift between the pair.

Jessica, who was emblazoned in a race row earlier this year leading to the Duchess of Sussex to reportedly cut ties with her, has since deleted the image from her Instagram page

The Duchess was reported to have cut ties with Jessica in the wake of the controversy, with a source telling the DailyMail.com at the time she was left 'mortified' by the scandal and informed her close friends she felt she could 'no longer be associated' with her.

'Meghan is absolutely mortified that she's been dragged into this complete mess. She said Jessica is in no way a racist, but the way she handled the situation [with Sasha] was tone-deaf and heartbreaking,' a close friend of Meghan's said at the time.

'Meghan said friends reflect friends and because of what's at stake she can no longer be associated with Jessica, at least not in public. 

'She has to do what she has to do in order to preserve her dignity and her own reputation,' the source added, admitting that they 'wouldn't be surprised' if the controversy was the 'beginning of the end of their friendship'.

But earlier this month Jessica shut down the rumours, branding a commenter's suggestion on one of her posts that she had been 'dumped' by Meghan 'fake news'.
