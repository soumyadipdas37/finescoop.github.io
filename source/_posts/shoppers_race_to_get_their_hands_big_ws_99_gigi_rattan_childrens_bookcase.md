A statement announcing the launch of the range reveals it was inspired by desert colours and natural materials, bringing a sense of laid-back bohemian spirit to homes across the country. 

Amid the continuing coronavirus crisis and a year of unprecedented challenges, the department store sought to create pieces to 'enhance happiness and overall well-being' for Australians.

To achieve this, product designers collaborated with internationally renowned psychologist Dr Tim Sharp, best known as 'Dr Happy'.

'The last few months have been tough for families and caused massive disruption to most of our lives. We are spending more time than ever together in our homes, and it's fair to say some areas of our lives have been a little neglected,' Dr Sharp said.

'From the lighting of a room to ornaments and furniture, there are numerous ways the space we live in affects our happiness, which in turn leads toward better health and improved well-being, ultimately resulting in emotional benefits for the whole family.'

The spring homewares range is available online and in Big W outlets nationwide.
