She appeared makeup free, and wore a blue cap over her locks which were pulled into a bun. 

Bambi was enjoying a refreshing drink and making a phone call, captioning the image simply, 'business'. 

In July, it was revealed that Bambi has found love in the arms of a hunky Australian actor Thomas Cocquerel.

 Happy together? In July, it was revealed that Bambi has found love in the arms of a hunky Australian actor Thomas Cocquerel (pictured) 

The model, who split from her fashion designer husband Dan Single three years ago, is reportedly living with her new man, 30, in a beachside apartment in Bondi. 

While the couple have kept their relationship mostly out of the public eye, they were spotted looking very amorous that month as they strolled down the Bondi promenade arm-in-arm.   

Sydney-born Thomas has appeared in a number of local and international productions, including One Mile To You, In Like Flynn, Otherlife, Celeste, and Kidnapping Mr. Heineken.

He has also appeared in several television shows, including Australian drama Love Child and American series The 100. 

Bambi split from her Dan in 2017, one month after he fell 'feet first' from a bedroom window at the Hotel Grand D'Amour apartment in Paris. 

A month later, previously supportive fans turned on him, labelling him 'pathetic' for using fundraising website Go Fund Me to ask for $250,000 to cover hospital bills.
