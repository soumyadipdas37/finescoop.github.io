Formula One is set to stage the biggest sporting spectator-event of the Covid-19 era with 30,000 fans expected for the Russian Grand Prix.

Just days after it was announced that the UK Government had abandoned plans to bring fans back to sporting arenas, tens of thousands of spectators will be admitted to Sochi’s Olympic Park this weekend.

Russia has exceeded one million Covid-19 cases and 6,431 new infections were reported on Wednesday.

Tens of thousands of spectators will be admitted to Sochi’s Olympic Park this weekend

The F1 season has taken place behind closed doors, but 3,000 spectators were admitted to the Tuscan Grand Prix earlier this month. 

Although 30,000 will be admitted through the gates over three days in Sochi, the majority will be in attendance for Sunday’s race.

Lewis Hamilton will be bidding to match Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 victories.
