Netflix is allowing nonsubscribers to watch several movies and shows for free, including popular hits like Stranger Things and Bird Fox, without having to create an account with the streaming giant.

Anyone using a desktop or Android browser can start streaming a select few pieces of content free of charge, though the service is not yet available to those with iOS browsers.

Netflix is offering just the first episodes of series like Stranger Things, Elite, When They See Us, Love Is Blind, Our Planet, Boss Baby, and Grace and Frankie.

But viewers can watch the entirety of select films including Netflix originals like Bird Box, Murder Mystery, and The Two Popes.

The free sampling, which will be available in all of the more than 200 countries where Netflix is streaming, was first reported by the website OnlyTech.

Netflix told Fox Business: ‘We're looking at different marketing promotions to attract new members and give them a great Netflix experience.’

Netflix has been one of the beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic as the service has added millions of subscribers in recent months.

In the first half of 2020, Netflix added 25.86 million subscribers - the most ever for a six-month period.

That’s almost as many subscribers that joined Netflix in all of 2019.

Last week, Netflix’s stock price reached an all-time high after announcing the news.

As of around 3pm on Monday, Netflix was trading at around $530 per share.

Just before the pandemic in early March, Netflix was trading at around $380 per share.
