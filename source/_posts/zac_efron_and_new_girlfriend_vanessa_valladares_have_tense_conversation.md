Zac Efron has been enjoying a new romance with Australian waitress Vanessa Valladares for the last two months.

And while things appear to be going well between the two so far, there may be some issues brewing around Zac's upcoming work commitments in America. 

According to an onlooker, the couple were overheard at a café having a serious conversation about their future together.

The Hollywood hunk, 32, will need to return to the States soon to begin filming his next project, and Vanessa may not be able to go with him due to the current coronavirus travel restrictions.

'They were first talking about how they enjoyed their trip to Thredbo,' the onlooker told Daily Mail Australia.

'Zac then mentioned having to travel back to America eventually for work commitments, although he wasn't sure when he would have to go back,' they added.

'It sounded like there was a little bit of stress and tension between them over the fact that his girlfriend may not be able to go with him due to the strict border rules.'

Zac currently has two movies in pre-production, including a remake of the classic comedy Three Men and a Baby for Disney+.

'They mentioned that once Zac leaves he won't be allowed back into Australia because he's not a citizen, but his girlfriend also isn't allowed to travel to America so they'd effectively be separated until COVID-19 restrictions are eased,' the onlooker said.

'They also seemed to be a little bit worried by the number of COVID cases in America compared to Australia.'

Who magazine reported earlier this week that Zac was introduced to Byron Bay local Vanessa, 25, through her boss at the café where she worked as a waitress.

Vanessa was working at the Byron Bay General Store café and the Light Years restaurant when she met the High School Musical star in July.

'They were introduced by her boss,' a source told the publication. 'Lucky girl!'

Meanwhile, another source told People that the couple 'are having fun' at the moment, but they're not ruling out the possibility of a serious relationship.

'Zac met Ness earlier in the summer,' the insider said. 'You can tell that they are having fun. She spends a lot of time at this house.'

While the pair have been spending most of their time in Byron Bay, they recently enjoyed a few days at the Thredbo ski resort in the NSW Snowy Mountains.
