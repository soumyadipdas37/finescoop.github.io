Leeds have announced the signing of Diego Llorente from Real Sociedad.

The 27-year-old defender has joined in a deal worth up to £20million and signed a four-year deal at Elland Road. 

Llorente, who will wear the No 14 shirt, has become the second Spain international to join Leeds this summer with the club having already secured Rodrigo from Valencia.

The defender spent the early part of his career at Real Madrid, but only made three appearances for the first team. 

Instead he often played in youth squads or out on loan at Rayo Vallecano and Malaga.

He joined Real Sociedad in 2017, and has since made 88 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals in that time. 

More to follow.
