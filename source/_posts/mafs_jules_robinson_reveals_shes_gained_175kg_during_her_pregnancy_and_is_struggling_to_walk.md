Married At First Sight star Jules Robinson has revealed she's 'struggling to walk' after gaining 17.5kg during her pregnancy.

The 37-year-old shared a series of photos and a post about her journey to Instagram on Wednesday, ahead of the arrival of her first child with husband Cameron Merchant.

'As the end is near...well actually the start of new beginnings. I think back to when my bump was so little, but to me it was so big,' she wrote.

'Fast forward to photo three and 17.5 kilos heavier and yep the struggle is real. I can only just walk by night, it's more of a slide,' she added.



She also said the most important thing is her 'growing baby is health as that's all that matters'.

Jules continued to say that she's looking forward to getting back to fitting into all her dresses after giving birth.

'I will do just that, with no pressure on my self or my body... I look forward to feeling fit and strong but most importantly becoming a healthy and happy mum to my little one,' she said.

Jules is currently 39 weeks pregnant and expecting her little one any day now.
