Lil Nas X won't be just a rapper and singer for long — soon he'll be a published author.

The 21-year-old Old Town Road singer revealed Tuesday on Twitter that he's set to release his first children's book.

The new book, C Is For Country, is being published by Random House and will hit shelves in January 5, 2021.

Nas boasted about the book in a tweet that featured the front cover.

'i’m dropping the best kids book of all time soon! C IS FOR COUNTRY, out January 5, 2021 from @randomhouse,' he wrote. 'I can't wait to share it with you all.' 

The cover features a cowboy dressed in a purple outfit almost identical to the one Nas wore to the Grammys earlier this year.

The character brandished an acoustic guitar in one hand while his trusty pony Panini reared up on its hind legs.

Young readers can expect to see 'Lil Nas X... and Panini the pony on a joyous journey through the alphabet from sunup to sundown,' according to the publisher's website.

Reader will also 'Experience wide-open pastures, farm animals, guitar music, cowboy hats, and all things country,' according to the statement.

Fans of the rapper will be familiar with Panini as the name of one of his songs, though the original doesn't involve a pony.

Fans of Nas (real name: Montero Hill) are likely more excited about the prospect of new music coming from the multi-platinum artist, who boasts the record for the longest-running number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.

Back in July he shared a short video of himself lip syncing to one of his upcoming songs, which he revealed was named Call Me By Your Name, after the novel and its Oscar-winning film adaptation.

So far, he hasn't revealed much about the album, but he said it was 'almost finished' and he announced more song titles including Don't Want It, One Of Me and Titanic.
