Cassie just wrapped a very big week when it comes to some of life's milestones. 

The 34-year-old singer celebrated both her birthday and a one year engagement-anniversary to her celebrity fitness trainer husband Alex Fine, 27 over the weekend. 

On Monday the brunette beauty took to her Instagram to share another blessing she has in her life, the couple's nine-month-old daughter, Frankie Stone Fine, who she gave birth to in December.

In a sweet Instagram story, Cassie holds Frankie in her arms as the two pretty ladies wear mommy-and-me matching daisy bathing suits.

The Me & U singer looks lovingly at her daughter, as Frankie gently grabs her mother's bikini top. She captioned the image, 'My angel baby.'

For her day in the sun, Cassie kept her jewelry minimal only wearing a simple gold chain and some diamond earrings. 

Cassie announced her pregnancy with her ray of sunshine back in June of 2019, just six months after she and her then boyfriend Alex became official. Their romance came fresh off the heels of her public breakup with boyfriend of 11 years, Sean 'Diddy' Combs. 

After revealing their baby news in June of 2019, the Riverdale trainer proposed to Cassie just two months later in August. The couple wed in early October of 2019, opting for an intimate Malibu ceremony. 

Fast love: Cassie and her now husband Alex dated for less than a year before it was announced the couple were pregnant with their first child together. Shortly thereafter the pair wed last summer in Malibu

New mom: Cassie announced her pregnancy in June of 2019 with then boyfriend Alex Fine. Within two months the couple were engaged to be married before saying 'I do' in October 2019

Frankie Stone: Though the relationship between Alex and Cassie progressed quickly,the couple seems to be loving the life they have created for their little family

In a sweet tribute to her husband, Cassie reposted their wedding video to celebrate a year being engaged to her best friend and now father to their child. 

Cassie wrote 'Happy 1 year Anniversary! One year ago today I got to marry my best friend....It’s hard to believe that a year has gone by. It feels like a minute, but it also feels like I’ve known you forever. I love you beyond what my wildest dreams could have ever measured. You and Frankie are my world! I can’t wait for this day every year'

Though their relationship progressed quickly, Cassie and her Alex seem to be loving the life they have created for their little family. Recently the celebrity trainer even helped his bride lose 30 pounds after she gave birth to their daughter. 

Speaking about her struggle to get her motivation back, the singer said, 'Alex spent those months in quarantine with me trying to drag me out of my slump to workout because he wanted me to be happy again, but more often than not I didn’t budge. I finally started working out 2-3 times a week and I’ve gradually moved up to 5-6.' 

Almost Home: Alex has his own fitness website where he shares workouts and also sells athletic clothing, called Almost Home. Back in July Alex shared Cassie's fitness regimen that helped her lose 30 pounds after giving birth
