She's following in the footsteps of Sarah Jessica Parker and Sutton Foster in a brand new series about 'a bold woman, unafraid to take on the world.'

And Lily Collins can be seen in the enticing and fashionable new trailer, released Tuesday, for Netflix series Emily In Paris – which sees the Abduction star taking on the City of Light.

Conceived by Sex And The City creator Darren Star, Emily In Paris starts where that groundbreaking HBO series left off – in the French capital, where Collins's Emily is hired by a Parisian marketing firm to 'provide them with an American perspective'.
