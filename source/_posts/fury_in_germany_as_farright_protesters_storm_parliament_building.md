An attempt by far-right demonstrators to storm Germany's Reichstag following a protest against the country's Covid-19 restrictions has been condemned by senior officials.


Hundreds of protesters breached a security barrier and raced up the steps outside Berlin's parliament building late on Saturday before being stopped and dispersed by police.


Some of those involved had held the flag of former imperial Germany, which is used by the Reichsbürger far-right group.


Germany's president Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the use of Reich flags and right-wing provocations was 'an unbearable attack on the heart of our democracy.'


'We will never accept this.' he said.

Mr Steinmeier said people had the right to express their anger about the coronavirus restrictions and to question them publicly, including with demonstrations.


'My sympathy ends where protesters allow themselves to be used by enemies of democracy and political agitators,' he added.


Police used pepper spray to drive back the protesters, who earlier in the day had participated in a large rally through the capital. 


About 300 people were arrested in front of the Reichstag and following an incident at the Russian embassy, police said.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer added: 'The Reichstag is the domain of our parliament and the symbolic centre of our democracy. 


'It is unbearable that troublemakers and extremists misuse it for their own purposes.'      


Berlin's top security official, Andreas Geisel, praised three officers who had stood alone against the protesters outside the Reichstag until reinforcements arrived.


But opposition parties criticised the police's failure to station sufficient officers around parliament despite public warnings from far-right extremists that they planned to try to enter the building.


Robert Habeck, the co-leader of Germany's Green party, called for a thorough investigation into the incident.

The earlier demonstration, called by the Querdenken 711 movement, had seen around 38,000 people turn out to protest against the nation's lockdown measures


'The fact that Nazis with imperial war flags try to storm the Bundestag recalls the darkest period in German history,' he said.


'An incident like on Saturday evening must not be allowed to happen again.


'I expect interior minister Horst Seehofer to decisively combat right-wing extremism at all levels.'


The earlier demonstration, called by the Querdenken 711 movement, had seen around 38,000 people turn out to protest against the nation's lockdown measures.


The group believes the preventative regulations infringe on the rights and freedoms set out in Germany's constitution, the BBC reported.   


The protest was initially banned but later allowed to go ahead on the condition those taking part adhered to coronavirus measures including social distancing and wearing masks. 


Germany, which has seen 9,297 deaths due to coronavirus, relaxed lockdown measures in April. 


Citizens do, however, face a minimum £45 fine if they are seen not wearing a face mask. People are required to wear masks on public transport, in shops and in some public buildings such as libraries and schools.


Despite the protest, opinion polls show overwhelming support for the Covid-19 measures imposed by the German government.
