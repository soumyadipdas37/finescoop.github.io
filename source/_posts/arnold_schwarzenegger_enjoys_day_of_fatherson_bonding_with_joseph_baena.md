They share a love for working out.

And Arnold Schwarzenegger and his son Joseph Baena enjoyed another day of bonding on Thursday.

Arnold, 73, and his son, 22, were spotted bike riding through Santa Monica, California, together.

Interestingly, while the pair sported face masks to protect themselves from coronavirus, they were not wearing helmets.

The duo appeared to be riding at a leisurely pace, avoiding any out-of-the-ordinary movements.

Arnold kept his eye on the road while pedaling his way down a cobblestone road and an intersection by the beach.

The former Governor of California and his son were perfectly dressed to pedal their way through the grey coastal community.

Let's get this show on the road: Joseph wore a disposable face mask, blue sweatshirt, and Vans slip-on sneakers

Arnold stayed warm beneath a red down jacket, while wearing a pair of midnight blue shorts to efficiently pedal his bike around.  

He also wore a black face mask from UNKNWN, the fashion line LeBron James is a co-founder of.

Joseph wore a disposable face mask, blue sweatshirt, and Vans slip-on sneakers.

Careful now: The duo crossed an intersection by the beach 

Walk down memory lane: Last week, Arnold shared a snap from his 12-mile bike ride, posing by the Gold's Gym where he filmed the 1977 docudrama, Pumping Iron

Throughout quarantine, Arnold has been regularly spotted going on bike rides with various members of his family.

In addition to providing exercise, the bike rides have literally been a trip down memory lane for Arnold.

Last week, Arnold shared a snap from his 12-mile bike ride, posing by the Gold's Gym where he filmed the 1977 docudrama, Pumping Iron.

'I love stopping on my 12 mile bike rides to enjoy some of my fantastic memories,' he captioned the image. 'When I ride by the original Gold's where we shot Pumping Iron in 1975, I can almost hear the weights clanging around and smell the sweat.

'I can feel the joy of the friendships I built here. It's so important to remember where you came from, and all of the people who helped you along the way.'

Like his father, Joseph is an avid bodybuilder who shares snaps from his grueling weightlifting workouts on his Instagram account.
