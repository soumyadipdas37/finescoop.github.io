Four men have been arrested on suspicion of raping a 19-year-old woman in an alleyway last Saturday evening.

The men, aged 37 years, 31 years, 25 years and 20 years, were detained by detectives investigating the stranger rape in Southsea, Hampshire.

Three of the suspects have since been released pending further inquiries while the 31-year-old remained in police cells today.

A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary said that the young woman told officers she had been raped in an alleyway at about 10pm on Saturday evening.

'At this time detectives are not linking this report to any other ongoing investigations,' said the spokesman.

Detective Inspector Emma Crute said: 'We are continuing to carry out inquiries and I am still keen to hear from any residents who may have heard or seen something that could assist our investigation.

'This incident took place on a busy Saturday night at the start of a bank holiday weekend and we believe there would have been a lot of people out and about in the area at the time.'

The police spokesman said that anyone with information was asked to call 101.
