Barcelona are close to completing the signing of Ajax right-back Sergino Dest.

The La Liga side have made an £18million bid for full back Dest which could end Max Aarons' hopes of a dream move to the Nou Camp.

Barcelona looked as though they were losing the race for Dest to Bayern Munich but have made a fresh approach according to Mundo Deportivo, after their attempts to sign Aarons on loan were rejected by Norwich last week.

The Canaries are holding out for a £20m bid for their star right back and were not prepared to entertain Barca's offer of a loan without an obligation to buy. 

USA international, Dest, is also wanted by Bayern after impressing in the Eredivisie last season.

The 19-year-old made five assists in 20 appearances and looks to have a bright future.

If the offer for Dest is accepted it would end Max Aarons' hopes of a dream move to the club

Barcelona have moved for Dest after Wolves completed the signing of Barcelona right-back Nelson Semedo for a club-record fee that could rise to £37million. 

The Premier League club announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the defender has left the Nou Camp for Molineux, posting a video of the 26-year-old taking in the stadium for the first time. 

He is the eighth client of super-agent Jorge Mendes to arrive at Molineux, while he brings the number of Portuguese stars in Nuno Espirito Santo's squad back up to 10 following the sale of Diogo Jota to Liverpool.
