Britney Spears just doubled down on her fight for more control of her conservatorship and has seemingly thrown her support behind the Free Britney movement.

The 38-year-old's attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported on Thursday. 

The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers.

Using her voice: An attorney for Britney Spears filed new court documents in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her conservatorship case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported on Thursday

Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, according to TMZ. 

The outlet added that the Toxic singer said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye. 

'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote.

'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a "joke" as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public,' the document stated.  

In August, Britney's dad Jamie called the Free Britney movement 'a joke' in an interview with PageSix.

'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' he said. 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'
