Last week, Caitlyn chimed in after news broke previously of the impending conclusion to E!'s reality phenomenon Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

The father of Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who herself had been on the show, reflected in an Instagram video and on her new YouTube channel that she is 'sad' to see the show go, a program which covered 'a great time' in her life.

The septuagenarian athlete has appeared in over 150 episodes of the show focusing on his blended family with ex-wife Kris, from 2007 up until their divorce in 2015 and subsequent gender transition. 

She went on to star for two seasons on the E! spin-off I Am Cait in 2016. 

Caitlyn revealed in an interview with an Australian TV show that she had not been given advance notice that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be coming to an end after 14 years and 20 seasons.

Caitlyn went on to declare: 'The girls and Kris have have done just an amazing job with the show and keeping it going for this long. But everybody is in a different place now and I think it's time to move on. But what a run.'
