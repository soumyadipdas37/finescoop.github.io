West Brom striker Kenneth Zohore will hold talks over a loan move to Sheffield Wednesday on Monday.

Manager Slaven Bilic is prepared to let the £8million signing from Cardiff City leave with the Dane failing to have the desired impact at the Hawthorns.

Zohore had interest from Italy and Turkey also but is open to joining Garry Monk at Hillsborough if terms can be agreed.

Bilic wants to add greater firepower to his attack to help survive in the Premier League. They have interest in Watford striker Andre Gray and are among ten clubs showing interest in Liverpool's Rhian Brewster.

Sheffield United, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa have been pushing for the England U21 international with Liverpool still to make a decision. They would want over £20m plus clauses if they sell while any loan move would involve penalty payments if he did not play.

West Brom will sign 36-year-old former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on Monday and are in the running for Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher.
