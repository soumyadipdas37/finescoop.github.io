Team Greece secured an early lead with their entrée featuring perfectly cooked prawns, while Team Vietnam's Rice Paper Rolls unravelled with undercooked Morton Bay Bug. 

Team Vietnam evened the score with a perfect main dish of Pork Belly with Bitter Melon Soup, scoring 30/30. 

Meanwhile, Team Greece lost some points in the main by not resting their lamb after a stressful cook.

Thanh added: 'Our experience on Plate of Origin has been extraordinary, it reminded us that food is a universal language.'
