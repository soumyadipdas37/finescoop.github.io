She's been treating herself to brief breaks from her typically busy schedule as she adjusts to life in the US.

And Dua Lipa appeared in great spirits as she packed on the PDA with her boyfriend Anwar Hadid during an al fresco dinner date in New York City on Wednesday evening.

The singer, 25, stood out in a bright graphic T-shirt and a powder blue jumper as she enjoyed the company of her model beau, 21.

The loved-up couple kissed and cuddled as they caught up over some street food, before they puffed on cigarettes outside the eatery.

Cutting a stylish figure, the Break My Heart hitmaker teamed her colourful look with wide-leg denim jeans and chunky black trainers.

The musician added a touch of girly glamour to her edgy appearance as she carried her essentials in a leather handbag, and accessorised with gold jewellery.

Her raven locks were worn in a straight style, while she nailed vampy chic in the beauty department with winged eyeliner and dewy foundation. 

LA native Anwar, who was seen carrying their new rescue pooch Dexter, opted for an all-black outfit during his romantic evening.

The outing comes days after Anwar became an uncle, following news his sister Gigi had given birth to a baby girl with boyfriend Zayn Malik.

It was reported last month that songstress Dua has upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to her man.

The Sun reported the brunette has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK.

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end.

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic.

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.

Congratulations! The outing comes days after Anwar became an uncle, following news his sister Gigi had given birth to a baby girl with boyfriend Zayn Malik (pictured)
