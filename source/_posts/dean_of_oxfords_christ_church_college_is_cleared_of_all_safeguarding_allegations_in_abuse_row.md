The latest attempt to oust an Oxford college dean failed yesterday after he was cleared of all safeguarding allegations.

A Church of England investigation found that the Very Reverend Professor Martyn Percy had acted ‘entirely appropriately’ in handling abuse allegations.

He had faced four complaints made to the Church’s National Safeguarding Team in which he was accused of mishandling historic abuse allegations reported to him by former students.

Professor Percy, dean of Christ Church college and its cathedral, said his exoneration meant a line had been ‘firmly drawn’ under questions over how he dealt with historic cases.

It followed internal complaints against the dean in 2018, which led to his suspension and the commissioning of an independent tribunal, The Times reported.

Professor Percy was exonerated and reinstated a year later. But last year, a vote of no confidence was tabled against him. He lost but remained in post.

The Bishop of Huddersfield, Dr Jonathan Gibbs, the lead safeguarding bishop, said yesterday: 'An independent investigation into allegations that the Dean, Martyn Percy, failed to fulfil his safeguarding responsibilities has concluded the Dean acted entirely appropriately in each case.

'The National Safeguarding Team (NST) followed the House of Bishops guidance when the four separate allegations were referred earlier in the year relating to the Dean, a senior office-holder.

'At no point was there any allegation or evidence that the Dean presented a direct risk to any child or vulnerable adult.'

Professor Percy posted on Twitter: 'Thank you to everyone for their support and prayers. It is good to have a line firmly drawn under this.'

He has taken the college to an employment tribunal which is due to be heard in public next year.

Christ Church college said that the church's ruling showed there had been 'no breach of the Church of England's protocols'.

'Safeguarding is of the utmost importance at Christ Church, and it is our obligation to report such concerns appropriately,' it added.
