It was the ultimate speed battle between man and nature as Felipe Massa took on a peregrine falcon, the fastest animal on planet Earth.  

Former F1 driver Massa, who has switched to the electric Formula E series for the coming season, attempted to outrun the bird of prey in Saudi Arabia. 

The peregrine falcon is capable of speeds of up to 217mph while diving for prey, making it the fastest creature in the world.

In the race, Massa drove the electric racing car through the desert with a lure attached, attempting to evade the claws of the falcon. 

It is the second time an FE car has raced a notoriously quick predator - last year, reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne took on a cheetah in South Africa, and narrowly won.

Fans demanded a rematch against a different creature, and after social media feedback, the peregrine falcon was chosen to compete against the former Ferrari racer. 

Massa managed to shake off the bird and complete the course with the lure unscathed

However man once again triumphed, as Massa managed to shake off the bird, and complete the course with the lure unscathed. 

The Brazilian, who will race for the Leonardo Di Caprio-owned Venturi team in FE this season, said: 'It was an incredible experience for me to race against the fastest member of the animal kingdom - it's not something I will forget in a hurry.'

The 2018-19 FE season starts on Saturday December 15 with the Ad Diriyah ePrix n Saudi Arabia, with Massa involved for the first time after ending his F1 career with Williams.

He said: 'I'm looking forward to returning to Ad Diriyah and to start racing. It'll be my first race in Formula E and I'm eager to get behind the wheel again. I've missed racing and this series has shown to be one of the most competitive out there.'
