sassy Klum: Heidi Klum dropped a surprise for her Instagram followers early on Monday morning. The German supermodel turned TV host posted a photo where she was completely naked behind a sheer curtain in a tricky game of is-this-going-too-far? with Instagram which has rules about showing private parts

Heidi was behind a beige sheer curtain with no clothes on and her chest visible as her hair was partially up and her arms spread out.

Behind her was a balcony with vines growing over the rail and a bag of fertilizer propped upside down. The balcony looked onto a swimming pool and had a nice view of surrounding trees.

According to the help page on Instagram nipples are not allowed: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content.... It also includes some photos of female nipples.' 

In high spirits at the start of the week: 'Mondazzzze ❤️,' wrote the America's Got Talent star in her caption

Klum has posed naked many times in the past for monthly magazines. Klum has posed nude for GQ, Allure and Maxim.

In 2017 she as part of a new collection of nude images shot by British photographer Rankin.

The model said she is more confident in her body now, after four pregnancies, than she ever was in her twenties.

Speaking at Naomi Campbell’s Fashion for Relief gala in Cannes, she told the Mail: ‘I figured, "why not?" Some friends of mine have said, "Well, you're turning 44…why now?"

That just rolled out of bed look: Her hair was partially pulled up with tendrils over her shoulders

'And I said, "Why not now?" We should be celebrating a woman's body, it doesn't matter what age they are.

‘I have posed naked before but I've just never showed it to everyone. I feel more confident now than when I was in my twenties.

‘I think when I was younger I was more shy and I've grown into myself.’

Miss Klum’s new book, Heidi Klum by Rankin, is released today and includes intimate naked shots of the model taken by Rankin over the past 10 years.

In 2016 Klum described herself as a ‘nudist’ and said she had come to enjoy being naked as a child.

She explained: ’I grew up going to nude beaches with my parents, so I'm a nudist. I have no problems with nudity at all.

'When I go to the beach, it's in a very remote place where there are not a lot of people, and I like to go topless.'

The former Victoria's Secret model has two sons, Henry, 14, and Johan, 13, as well as a daughter Lou, 10, with ex-husband, singer Seal, 56.

She also has a daughter, Leni, 16, with ex-partner Flavio Briatore. She dated art dealer Vito Schnabel, 33, then moved on to Tom.

This comes after she filed a request for an emergency court hearing seeking to force her ex-husband Seal to allow her to take their children to Germany with her in October. 

While he expressed concerns about the kids traveling to Europe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Seal has now agreed to allow Klum to take them with her, People reported Thursday.

Settled: The model reached an agreement with ex-husband Seal allowing her to take their kids with her to Germany for Next Top Model filming in October after she requested an emergency court hearing to force him to permit it

In return, Seal will get expanded visitation with the children both before they leave and upon their return, according to the publication, as well as being able to see them while they are in Germany if he so wishes. 

Klum is going to Germany to film a new season of the country's Next Top Model reality show.

In her previous court filing, she explained that the series is normally filmed in the USA but the German cast and crew are not permitted currently to enter America due to the pandemic. 

Klum and Seal, 57, married in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2014

Family: Klum has agreed to let Seal gave expanded time with the kids (pictured in 2019) before they leave and upon their return as well as allowing him to visit them in Germany

Klum married German guitarist Tom Kaulitz, 30, in February 2014. 

In legal documents obtained by TheBlast.com on August 20, the German model and TV personality explained that the children did not want to be parted from her for the three-and-a-half months she's contracted to be in Germany but that Seal had not signed off on the trip.

Instead, she stated, he preferred the children to remain in Los Angeles, where he also resides.   

The new agreement he has reached with Klum states that should the coronavirus crisis escalate to the point where the US decides to shut down its borders, Klum must 'immediately make arrangements in an effort to return home with the children before the borders close.'
