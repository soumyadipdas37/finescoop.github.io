She was left devastated after being brutally dumped by Locky Gilbert during The Bachelor finale on Thursday, but Bella Varelis said she's since moved on, with some cheeky encouragement from her mum, Kim.

During an interview with The Kyle & Jackie O Show on Friday, the 25-year-old Bachelor runner-up confessed the shock advice her mum gave her after her heartbreaking split with Locky.

'My mum actually did say to me, she was like, "The way to get over someone is to get under someone else." And I was like, "Mum! You shouldn't be saying that to me!"' Bella revealed.

Confessing she's since hooked up with other guys, she laughed: 'I've had some fun! But I haven't gotten around Sydney.'

It wasn't the only wisdom Kim imparted on her daughter, telling a heartbroken Bella that Locky, 31, simply was 'not your person'.

Bella admitted she was apprehensive about watching the show's finale, but was glad she did, because it gave her 'closure' on her relationship with Locky.

She said she watched the emotional episode with her mum by her side, and revealed they 'had a bit of a sleepover'.   

'It was really sweet! So, I didn't wake up with a boy, I woke up with my mum. Not how I planned it,' she added.

Bella admitted she was shocked that Locky didn't choose her, and said their relationship was filled with 'passion' and they had an 'electric connection'.

'I wasn't going to sit there and sell myself to him,' she added, speaking about their split. 

'Looking back last night, I was kind of like, "I deserve someone who knows they want to be with me. I don't want someone who's going to question it up until the very last second."'

Throughout the show's climatic finale, Locky repeatedly admitted he was torn between Bella and winner Irena Srbinovska, telling both women he loved them. 

'I've had some fun! But I haven't gotten around Sydney,' she laughed, confessing to hooking up with other guys since her split from Locky
