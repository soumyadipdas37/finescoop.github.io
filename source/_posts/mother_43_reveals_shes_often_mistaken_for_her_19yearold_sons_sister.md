A 43-year-old mother has revealed she's often mistaken for her son's sister due to her youthful appearance which makes people think she's less than half her age. 

Marcela Iglesias, from Los Angeles, is regularly asked if she's a teenager, and is told she doesn't look old enough to be her 19-year-old son Rodrigo's parent.

The flattered mother-of-one, who admits her teenage son used to get embarrassed by strangers' assumptions, keeps up her age-defying looks thanks to $1,000-a-year Botox sessions, stem cell therapy and lip and cheek filler.

The flattered mother-of-one admitted that her teenage son (pictured as a baby with his mother) used to get embarrassed by strangers' assumptions

She said: 'When we go out together to concerts or shopping - people think I am part of his gang. They can't believe I am his mother.

'I am flattered, it is a massive compliment. My son used to get embarrassed when he was young but he loves it now.'

Explaining why she believes people don't think she's old enough to be a parent, Marcela said: 'I guess it is because I am not a typical mother. I am trendy and fashionable.

'We sometimes share clothes, I have some unisex jackets which look great on him,' she added.

In a stem cell facelift, doctors take stem cell- enriched tissue from fatty areas like the stomach or inner thigh and inject it back into the face. 

Growth factors can also be added to help foster the existing cells to regrow and rebound into fresher-looking skin.  

Doctors may also use a centrifuge to separate the skin cells and add them back into the fat before grafting. 

Marcela confessed that she often doesn't act her age and is always catching up with her teenage son's friends. 

'Rodrigo says I don't look like a "normal" mother,' she admitted. 'I am a little crazy and extreme but Rodrigo doesn't mind. I don't act my age.

'I love hearing what the younger generation have to say, because they are our future - so I always catch up with my son's friends.

'I find that people forget how to live their life and worry too much with age, but I do my best to live life to the full.'

Despite spending $1,000 per year on Botox, Marcela hasn't had any plastic surgery - but she has had filler in her lips and cheeks to maintain her youthful looks, as well as stem cell therapy.

Marcela said: 'I started getting Botox and fillers in my thirties. I get it to maintain and enhance my natural looks.

'I have also had stem cell therapy which meant I was injected with 30 million stem cells. It is to repair and generate healthier and new cells.

Marcela and her son (pictured together when Roderigo was a baby) have a close bond and similar interests

'But I have never had any other cosmetic procedures - I definitely think less is more. I am not against surgery, but I do think if you get too much - it can make you look older.'

She added: 'However, I would be open to a face lift in the future if I need one. I also lead a stress-free life and quit smoking which is a key ingredient to looking younger.

'I lead a healthy and balanced lifestyle, which is always good for your appearance.'

Marcela and her son have a close bond and similar interests, with the mother adding: 'We are incredibly close and always together. We go shopping a lot together because he gives great fashion advice.

'Our bond is more like siblings rather than mother and son so it is not surprising that others are mistaken.'
