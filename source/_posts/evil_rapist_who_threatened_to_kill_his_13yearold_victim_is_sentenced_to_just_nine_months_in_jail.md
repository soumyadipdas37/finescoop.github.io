An evil rapist who sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl in a park and threatened to kill her if she called police has been sentenced to just nine months behind bars. 

Craig Anthony Mclean, 30, from Gympie, Queensland, preyed on a young teenager for a year from July 2018.  

The relationship initially started with months of 'hugging and kissing' before he raped her in late 2019 at a local lookout when she refused his advances, The Courier Mail reports. 

The girl reported the incident to police and he was charged with two counts of indecent treatment of a child under 16, one count of having carnal knowledge with a child under 16, and one count of possessing child exploitation material.   

Craig Anthony Mclean (pictured), 30, from  Gympie, QLD, was sentenced to nine months behind bars last week for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl from 2018 to 2019

Mclean tried to take his own life twice in the hours before his sentencing hearing at Gympie District Court last week.  

He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and three months in prison with the remainder of the term to be suspended once he serves nine months. 

The court heard the girl had told McLean she was not ready for sex in November 2018, and ran away from him during an encounter later that year when he reached beneath her bra and pants after she told him to stop. 

The pair met again a few months later in a park and had sex on a bench, exchanging sexually explicit photos into 2019. 

Mclean convinced the girl to meet him at a lookout, promising nothing would happen between them, but slowly began touching her despite her resistance, the court heard. 

When he ripped open her pants and she threatened to call the police if he did not stop, he told her: 'I will take your life if you call the police'.

She fought back until he stopped and he eventually dropped her home, with the girl then reporting the incident to police the following day. 

The court heard Mclean attempted to take his own life twice the morning of the sentencing hearing

He was charged after voluntarily attending the local police station in November 2019, and released on bail on the condition he did not use social media, which he then breached several times.  

He was arrested in January for threatening to kill anyone who reported him to police and placed in custody before being released on bail again in August.

The morning of last week's hearing, he was rushed to hospital after trying to take his life in a park before making a second attempt later that day, the court heard. 

The judge said Mclean's behaviour through out the course of the case's proceedings had demonstrated 'substantial self-interest' rather than remorse for his victim. 

Mclean was placed on a 15-month good behaviour bond for using a carriage service to harass and a six month sentence, to be served concurrently, for breaching a previous suspended sentence.
