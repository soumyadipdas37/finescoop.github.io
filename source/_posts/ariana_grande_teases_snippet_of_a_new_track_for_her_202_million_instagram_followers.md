The God Is A Woman singer previously teased: 'I'm obsessed with her. I love her.

'I was able to work with her earlier this year on this song that I want to save for whenever it's time again, to drop. But I love her so much. I love her personality. I love what she brings to the table musically,' Grande said of the Boss B*tch singer.

'She's just such a breath of fresh air. I think she's brilliant and so talented. And she produces, and she does everything herself. I love that. It's fantastic.'

And specifically about their collaboration, Ariana confirmed that it's something she's been sitting on for some time now. 

'We did this song together towards the end of last year and I love it so much.

'I remember when I first wrote it and sent it to her, she was in the shower and she was like, "B**ch, I love this. I'm in the shower,"' Ari recalled.

'And I was like, "Shower. You can call me back."'
