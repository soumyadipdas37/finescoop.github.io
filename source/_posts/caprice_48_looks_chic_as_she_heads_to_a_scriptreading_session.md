It comes after Caprice will take on a singing role in the film, The Gift, for the first time since her lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical. 

A source said: ‘Caprice has landed a leading role in an upcoming Christmas film called The Gift. 

'She is really excited but also slightly nervous because she has a singing part. It is the first time she has sang in about 15 years, since her theatre days when she starred as the lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical. 



'She actually has a good singing voice!'

They added: 'She saw the final script today at a meeting with the director. Acting is something she wants to focus more on in the future and Caprice always tells pals that it is a great creative outlet for her'   

Caprice has spent lockdown at her London home with her millionaire husband, Ty Comfort, and six-year-old sons, Jett and Jax. 

In June, she was shocked to learn that she tested negative for coronavirus antibodies, despite her family contracting the virus. 

Caprice recently enjoyed a family getaway to Ibiza where she was seen showcasing her stunning figure in a collection of bikinis.
