Michael Cohen says President Donald Trump believed Russian leader Vladimir Putin was behind the sale of his languishing Palm Beach Mansion that saw him pocket a $54million profit.

Trump bought the mansion in 2004 for more than $41million dollars and had trouble selling the sprawling 62,000-square foot property.

In 2008 it was finally purchased by Russian fertilizer king Dmitry Rybolovlev, for $95million, nearly double when Trump paid for it, leaving Trump pocketing an over $50million profit.

Cohen said Trump told him he believed the real buyer was Putin in the sale that took place before his presidency.

Trump bought the mansion in 2004 for more than $41million dollars and had trouble selling the sprawling 62,000-square foot property. In 2008 it was finally purchased by a Russian fertilizer king Dmitry Rybolovlev, for $95million, nearly double when Trump paid for it

'I don’t know what he was thinking….He believes that all of the Russian oligarchs are basically pawns of Vladimir Putin, he believes he controls all of them,' Cohen said on The Rachel Maddow Show last week.

Cohen detailed Trump’s belief that Putin secretly funded the deal in his new book Disloyal: A Memior, which was released on September 8. 

Cohen, the disbarred lawyer who served as an attorney for Trump from 2006 to 2018 was sentenced to three years in jail in 2018 for tax evasion and campaign finance violations.

In May he was released early due to concerns regarding the pandemic to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest. 

'Trump is keen on this power and whether its Putin, Mohammed bin Salman, Kim Jong Un, it’s the power that he’s so involved with and so in search of, that this is exactly what he believes,' Cohen said of Trump on the show.

'He believes that Putin controls all of Russia and all of its wealth and anything, like the purchase of this home, had to be with the permission of Vladimir Putin,' he added. 

The 'dodgy' Palm Beach mansion deal reportedly was investigated in the Mueller report into Trump but its findings weren’t released in the final report.  

Cohen says that Trump has a genuine admiration for the Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his power. Cohen said: 'He believes that all of the Russian oligarchs are basically pawns of Vladimir Putin, he believes he controls all of them'

At the time of the sale Rybolovlev (above), who made a fortune in fertilizer potash, said through a spokesman: 'This acquisition is simply an investment in real estate by one of the companies in which I have an interest'

At the time of the sale Rybolovlev, who made a fortune in fertilizer potash, said through a spokesman: 'This acquisition is simply an investment in real estate by one of the companies in which I have an interest,' according to the Seattle Times.

He noted that Rybolovlev didn’t have any plans to live in the US despite buying the massive property and the ownership of it was subsequently transferred to a trust.

Since then the Palm Beach mansion has been demolished, divided into three lots and sold.

Cohen says that Trump has a genuine admiration for the Russian leader. 

Cohen writes in his book that Trump praised Putin in 2016 'because he assumed he would lose and wanted to make sure he could borrow money from Russian sources for his real estate empire.'

He added that Trump praised Putin during his 2016 campaign because he wanted to borrow money from Russian oligarchs for his real estate empire.

As revealed in court records, Trump had dispatched Cohen to try to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, a 120-story building in the Red Square that would include a free penthouse for Putin.

Trump’s relationship with Russia has faced scrutiny time and time again in his election and presidency.

Cohen writes in his book that the Trump campaign didn’t need to conspire in the Russian election interference effort, all Trump had to do was sit back and reap the benefits.

'What appeared to be collusion was really a confluence of shared interests in harming Hillary Clinton in any way possible, up to and including interfering in the American election — a subject that caused Trump precisely zero unease,' Cohen writes in his book.
