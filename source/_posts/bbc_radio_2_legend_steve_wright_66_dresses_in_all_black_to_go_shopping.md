He's been a prominent feature on the BBC radio schedule since the 1980s.

He kept his personal items in a black satchel, and he looked relaxed as he walked through a supermarket before later taking a taxi home.

The star has previously spoken openly about his weight struggles.

In 2010, speaking to The Daily Mail, Steve revealed that he was on a mission to shed one-and-a-half stone in order to be more comfortable with his body shape; a goal weight of 12 or 13 stone. 

Steve, who has been 18 stone at his peak weight, had at the time already lost the same amount of weight by cutting chips and crisps.

He said at the time: 'I've been eating healthily and I've lost about one-and-a-half stone. But I want to lose another stone-and-a-half at least...

'I'm not there yet but I'm getting there. I've cut out chips, crisps and I no longer eat chocolate.' 

He also explained that he had been walking a lot around the West End, sometimes strolling a couple of miles to Regent's Park, but admitted that sitting down for his regular show had lead to his former weight gain.

Exercise: Steve also explained that he had been walking a lot around the West End, sometimes strolling a couple of miles to Regent's Park

'When you get to my age,' he added. 'You get that paunch and I also sit down all day for my work. So exercise is the key – but eating right is also important.'  

The star has two children, Tom, 29, and Lucy, 22, from his marriage to ex-wife Cyndi. The pair divorced in 1999. 

The DJ joined the BBC in 1980, previously presenting the Saturday night slot and breakfast shows on Radio 1.
