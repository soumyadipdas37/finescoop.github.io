He confirmed his relationship with model Brooke Meredith last Friday after they were spotted celebrating his 42nd birthday together.  

And Dr Chris Brown had fans wishing he was still on the market on Monday morning as he paraded his muscular physique at Clovelly Beach, Sydney. 

The hunky veterinarian was spotted emerging from the water wearing nothing but a pair of skimpy blue-and-red board shorts. 

Welcome to muscle beach! Dr Chris Brown, 42, paraded his muscular physique while enjoying a shirtless dip at Clovelly Beach, Sydney, on Monday 

With droplets falling from his Adonis frame, the The I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! host looked refreshed and alert as he strode from the shore. 

After drying off, Chris picked up his shoes and towel, slipped on a pair of tortoise shell sunglasses and began making his way home. 

The sighting comes days after the Studio 10 star was spotted strolling with his model girlfriend Brooke, dispelling rumours the pair had split after less than six months of dating.

In August, Woman's Day claimed that Chris was back on the market after cryptically hinting at his split from the 29-year-old model on Instagram.

'Over the last few months there's been no more dependable partner in the pandemic than a face like this,' he wrote alongside a photo of his cat. 

However, Friday's sighting confirmed the pair are still very much an item.

Meanwhile, Chris is reportedly gearing up to film the upcoming season of I'm A Celebrity, following rumours the Channel 10 show will return in 2021 despite low ratings.  

According to TV Tonight, the new season will be filmed in Australia due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.  

The show will reportedly be filmed in Murwillumbah, in northern New South Wales, at a campsite normally used for the UK series.
