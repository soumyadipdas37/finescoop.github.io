Ronald Koeman has told youngster Riqui Puig that he is not part of his first team plans at Barcelona, according to Spanish outlet RAC1. 

Barcelona's new boss left Puig out of the squad for Saturday's Joan Gamper Trophy match against Elche.

Reports say that Koeman told the midfielder that he does not fit the right profile for his style of play, and that he should look for another club.

Puig was first called up to Barcelona first-team training in 2018, and was hailed as a wonderkid by some fans.

When Lionel Messi took him under his wing in those early training sessions, it looked like he was destined for a future at the club.

He has made 15 appearances for the first-team, not scoring any goals, but providing three assists. 

However eyebrows were raised when previous boss Quique Setien didn't pick Puig to play in the Champions League in August, despite blocking him from playing for the B side.

Puig was lauded as a bright future talent when he arrived, but may be on his way out the door

Now this new setback involving Koeman means it appears Puig will be leaving the club he has long been a fan of. 

Puig has faced a large amount of competition for a midfield role in the team, even from his fellow youth squad members. 

However, the 21-year-old's contract runs until 2023, so it remains to be seen whether he will stick around to try and convince his manager of his worth, or whether other clubs will come knocking for his services.
