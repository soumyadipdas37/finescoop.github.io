Students at one of Australia's most exclusive all-girls schools could be banned from sitting final exams after plans for vulgar muck-up day 'Scavenger Hunt' were leaked.

Students at Pymble Ladies College, on Sydney's north shore, encouraged each other to 'swallow a goldfish', 'streak down a highway' and to even 'have sex with someone's dad' as part of a graduation challenge.

Many of the challenges in the document believed to be associated with the $33,000-a-year school were sexual or criminal in nature.

Students would be split into teams and would gain points for every task they could prove they had completed. 

Graduating students at elite private girls' school Pymble Ladies' College (pictured), on Sydney's north shore, allegedly created a vulgar muck-up day challenge 

Some of the alleged challenges by the students at Pymble encouraged girls to 'have sex with someone's dad' and 'eat someone's vomit'

A spokesperson for the school said students would face punishment for carrying out the muck-up day plan, 7NEWS reported.  

'We are horrified and disappointed that any student would have their name associated with what was apparently a competitive list between students at a number of schools,' they said.

'Students have been advised of the consequences.'

One of the alleged tasks challenged students to 'do cocaine off someone's body', to 'get arrested' or even apply for a job at a brothel. 

The God Tier of challenges asked Year 12 girls to get a tattoo and tell their parents how they lost their virginity

Sending a 'group photo' to specific teachers, inking a 'PYMBLE' tattoo or getting a face piercing was worth 100 points. 

The 'God tier' level of challenges also included 'ring parent and explain in depth how you lost your virginity' and 'meet up with someone' from LGBTQ dating app Grindr.      

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Pymble Ladies College for comment.

A similar scavenger hunt was also organised as part of a muck-up challenge for the elite Shore School on Sydney's lower north shore. 

The 'official rule and challenge book' - created by students in a PDF document - revealed they planned to meet between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday at Waverton Park for the series of 'treacherous' challenges.

The school leavers would then be split into teams of five or six before carrying out a series of tasks to compete for points.  

The rule book stated all participants from the $33,000-a-year school were required to chip in $10 and the team who gathers the most points would be awarded the total cash prize.   

Before starting the challenges, the groups would be required to finish a case of 30 beers in 15 minutes.

The competitors would then be given seven hours of 'hunting' from 6pm to 1am. 

There were more than 150 challenges listed in the scavenger hunt rule book and the tasks range in difficulty.   

Students from elite private boys' school Shore, in Sydney's lower north shore, also attempted to complete a controversial challenge named the 'Triwizard Shorenament' (pictured)

The school is among the top ranked in New South Wales and regularly features impressive Year 12 results

One challenge called the 'Pakistan Sacrifice' read: 'Eat two laxatives and a Phaal Curry (spicy curry) from Lavender Bay Curry. 

'Warning: Will be s***ing all night and probably will want to die.'

Another challenge was dubbed the 'trifecta spit' which included a 'spit roast', spitting on a homeless man and jumping off the Spit Bridge.

For 10,000 points, students could 'get on a plane to Melbourne'.  

There were more than 150 challenges listed in the scavenger hunt rule book and the tasks ranged in difficulty. The 'Beta' difficulty (pictured) was deemed the easiest for competitors, with five to ten points up for grabs for each task
