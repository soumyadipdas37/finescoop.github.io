Captain Tom Moore asked for a can of Coke, a Dairy Milk bar and 'six blondes' in his dressing room when he appeared on TV with Piers Morgan.

The Good Morning Britain host, 55, spoke to the 100-year-old war hero, who raised £32million for NHS Charities Together, for the new series of his ITV chat show Life Stories.   

Morgan said the interview, which Captain Tom reportedly welcomed after the pair swapped numbers and spoke regularly, was his 'greatest' episode of all time.

Speaking about the show, he told the Sun: 'He asked if he could come on the show, and on his rider was a can of coke, Dairy Milk chocolate bar and six blondes.

'He told me the number of blondes was "variable". He's a real ladies' man. He said to me, "Let me put it like this; I'm not allergic to girls".

'A lot of women would like to have a cup of tea with Captain Tom - he's an unashamed ladies' man, in the nicest possible way.'

Morgan previously revealed Captain Tom is 'even more charming in real life' after interviewing him for Life Stories, which will air on Sunday night.

Last week, he shared a picture of them backstage on his Instagram page, writing: 'The great man! Backstage with Captain Sir Tom Moore before our Life Stories chat. 

'First time we've met in person and he's even more charming in real life. Should be a brilliant interview.'

He also posted a photo of the centenarian in the interview seat writing: 'In the hot seat. What a life, what a story. Captain Sir Tom Moore.'  

In a behind-the-scenes video, the host pans the camera around the Life Stories film set before stopping at Captain Tom telling viewers that this was going to be 'a very special show'.  

A TV insider said the GMB host was 'in awe' when he finally met his hero Captain Tom in person for the first time. 

The source said: 'Like the rest of the nation, Piers was in awe of Sir Tom's fundraising.  The campaign really took off after Tom appeared on Good Morning Britain, so Piers feels great pride in what Tom achieved.

'In the dark days of lock-down, it was everyday heroes, not celebs, who brought joy to the nation.

'So while it's normally scandalous figures who make the best episodes on his show, Piers knew Tom's extraordinary, inspiring story would be a big draw

In April, Piers Morgan donated £10,000 to Captain Tom Moore's 'magnificently inspiring' fundraising campaign for the NHS while he was live on Good Morning Britain.  

The then 99-year-old was walking laps of his garden to raise money for the NHS and eventually raised £32 million.

Captain Tom Moore was posted to India during the Second World War where he fought in the Arakan Campaign of 1942 to 1943 

The GMB presenter said: 'Captain Tom Moore, thank you for serving your country. I'm so glad that we were able, through the brilliant NHS, to serve you back and keep you going.

'Good luck - I want to get you over the line today. Here's what I'm going to do, Tom, I'm going to put £10,000 of my own money into your fundraising today and I hope that encourages everyone watching at home to do the same.' 

Morgan called for a knighthood for Captain Tom in April, before the war veteran received the honour from the Queen at Windsor Castle in July.
