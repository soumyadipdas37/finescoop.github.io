A Los Angeles English teacher was forced to flee her home after receiving numerous death threats for wearing an 'I Can’t Breathe' T-shirt during one of her virtual class sessions.
The teacher at El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, California wore the shirt in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and included instruction about racial injustice in her teaching, which the school allowed.
But a parent upset with her class allegedly shared a photo of the teacher on social media along with her e-mail address and invitations to harass her.
She was bombarded with threats last week that forced her to leave her home with her daughter in fear of their lives. 
Protests and rallies in support of the teacher unfolded outside the school last week.

An angry parent shared an image of her on Twitter wearing the shirt along with her e-mail address, leading her to receive threats and hate messages
Scott Blodgett is one of the parents upset with the teacher's curriculum that covers the civil unrest unfolding across the country. 'I just want my daughter to go to English class and learn about English,' Blodgett said
The photo was later shared by Elijah Schaffer, the podcast host of YouTube's 'Slightly Offens*ve', on his Twitter account, which led the teacher to receive hundreds of emails and threats
'I can’t afford to go to a hotel and I can’t go home. My daughter’s a ninth-grader starting at this school. We can’t stay in our home,' the teacher said to CBS Los Angeles.

Blodgett said he has been accused of trying to get the teacher fired but said that wasn’t his intention, calling the death threats against her 'horrible'.   
The teacher says she has since filed a restraining order against Blodgett and two other men.
She defended talking about racial injustice in her curriculum, stressing the importance of 'having authors of color, children of color writing, talking about being black in a biased world.'
On Thursday students and locals came out to El Camino Real Charter High School to support the teacher and the Black Lives Matter movement
Students were seen holding Black Lives Matter signs and a poster that said 'Walk Our Talk', in support of the teacher's effort to teach racial injustice to her students
These locals held a sign that said 'Teaching Social Justice = Student Success'
The school had permitted the teacher to include instruction about racial and social injustice in her classes following a string of instances of police brutality and national protests.
The Los Angeles Unified School District also said the school is an independent charter and can develop instruction on these topics as long as they follow state guidelines. 
The school has also voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement and the teacher.  
El Camino’s executive director David Hussey said administrators reached out to the teacher to 'help her and support her as best as we can.'
'The start of the school year with distance learning has been stressful and traumatic enough, but now this teacher has the stress and trauma of being attacked and harassed with hate speech and threats,' Cecily Myart-Cruz, the president of the United Teachers Los Angeles union said on behalf of the teacher. 
'This is absolutely unacceptable,' she added.
