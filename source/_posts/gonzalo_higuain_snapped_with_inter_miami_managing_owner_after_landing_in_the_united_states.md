Gonzalo Higuain has been pictured with Inter Miami's managing owner Jorge Mas as he closes in on his move to the club.

Higuain has arrived in United States, with Juventus having terminated his contract a year early to allow him to secure the move.

Mas posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Higuain accompanied by the caption: 'A warm welcome to Gonzalo Higuain, a world class striker and champion.'

Higuain had his contract at Juventus terminated a year early in order to allow him to leave

Higuain's brother Nicolas was in Italy on Tuesday to hold discussions over the former Argentina international's future.

Once his move to Inter Miami is finalised, the 32-year-old is poised to link up with his former Juventus team-mate Blaise Matuidi.

Inter Miami, owned by David Beckham, secured a 2-1 victory over Atlanta United this week.

Higuain scored 66 goals in 148 appearances for Juventus, winning three Serie A titles and two Coppa Italias. 

During his time at Juventus he had spells on loan at AC Milan and Chelsea.
