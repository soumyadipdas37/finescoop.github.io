A netball star player was verbally abused and spat at by fans of an opposing team while heading out for dinner. 

West Coast Fever midcourter Verity Charles, 29, was with her fellow teammates in Brisbane, on Saturday night, when she was targeted by a group of women. 

The four women were reportedly wearing Queensland Firebirds jerseys - Charles' former team in 2014/15.

They ganged up on Charles with one calling her 'disgusting' and another spitting on the ground in front of her.

Charles' club confirmed the incident occurred and thanked fans for their support. 

'The incident that took place between one of our players and four members of the general public on Saturday night is very disappointing,' the Fever club said in a statement.

'West Coast Fever continues to provide all the support that our players need to continue to live in the Queensland hub safely.

'The club would like to thank the Queensland Firebirds who reached out to offer their support.'

The Firebirds chief executive Catherine Clark apologised to Charles following the incident.  

'Let me be absolutely clear, this behaviour will not be tolerated by our club,' she told The Australian. 

'Those involved should be ashamed of themselves. The person wearing a Firebirds shirt should hand it back.

'You clearly do not share our values. You are not welcome at our club.' 

Charles took to Facebook Live on Sunday and also thanked her fans for their positive messages (pictured with husband Nathan)
