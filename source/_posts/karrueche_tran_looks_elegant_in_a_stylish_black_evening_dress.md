Karrueche Tran and Meagan Good led the celebrity arrivals as personal stylist EJ King threw a lavish birthday party in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. 

The pair were on had to celebrate with an array of guests at the Beverly Hills event, with Instagram posts suggesting the party went on into the early hours.

The model and actress added to her look with a pair of strappy black heels, while a highly distinctive box-shaped handbag rounded things off 

In accordance with current safety guidelines she wore a protective face covering outside the venue, but was easily distinguishable rubbing shoulders with her fellow guests - among them close friend Meagan.  

In complete contrast to Karrueche's glamorous look, the actress, 39, opted for a comparatively relaxed black T-shirt and matching leggings.

Crossing paths outside the venue, the pair appeared delighted to see each other as they chatted before making their way up to the rooftop party. 

Taking to Instagram with husband DeVon Franklin earlier that day, Meagan praised celebrity stylist EJ's 'humility and kindness' in a sweet birthday video.
