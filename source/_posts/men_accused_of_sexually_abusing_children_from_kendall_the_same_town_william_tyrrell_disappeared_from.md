Two men who allegedly sexually abused children as young as one from the same town William Tyrrell disappeared from will be hit with 250 extra charges.  

Timothy Luke Doyle, 26, and Steven Garrad, 21, allegedly committed most of the offences at Kendall, along the New South Wales mid north coast, Port Macquarie Local Court heard on Thursday. 

Kendall is the same town that three-year-old William Tyrrell disappeared from in September 2014.

Daily Mail Australia does not suggest Doyle or Garrad were in any way involved in the disappearance of William Tyrrell. 

Doyle and Garrad were arrested at Kendall and the nearby coastal town of Old Bar in June, Daily Telegraph reported.

Police seized a laptop as well as other electronic items during the raids. 

Garrad already faces six counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years - with the youngest child being a one-year-old.

The offences allegedly took place between 2017 and 2020.

He also faces one count of possessing child abuse material.

Doyle faces two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years, two counts of produce child abuse material and two counts of possess/control child abuse material using carriage service.

Court documents allege a video was also made at a mid-north coast childcare centre.

Both men are being held in custody and will front court in October.

Garrad and Doyle were arrested as part of a wider police sting known as Operation Arkstone.

Seven other people from New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have been arrested because of it. 

'We are continuing to try to identify other children who we suspect were preyed on by individuals in the alleged network,' AFP Assistant Commissioner for ACCCE and Northern Command Lesa Gale said.

'It is heartbreaking to think of any child being sexually abused, but it strengthens our resolve to hunt down perpetrators and bring them to justice.'
