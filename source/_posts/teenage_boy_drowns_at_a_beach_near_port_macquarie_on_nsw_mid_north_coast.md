A 17-year-old boy has tragically drowned at an unpatrolled beach on the New South Wales mid north coast. 

The teenager got into difficulties while swimming with his family at Diamond Head, about 40km south of Port Macquarie at about 1pm on Wednesday.

Police pulled him from the water and started CPR, before paramedics arrived  on the scene and took over. 

Sadly, he was unable to be revived and died at the scene.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.
