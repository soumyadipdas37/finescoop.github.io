Her stratospheric rise in Hollywood has come at the expense of extensive physical comparisons to fellow Australian actress, Margot Robbie.

And their likeness is so uncanny that Samara Weaving has now revealed that she is regularly approached by excited fans who believe they're meeting the Oscar-nominated actress.

'I've tried saying, "No, it's not who you think it is," but because I also have an Australian accent, people still think I'm Margot and that she's being really rude. Now I just stand there like her, ' the 28-year-old star told WHO Magazine.

Samara also said she was once approached for a photo by a young Margot fan who thought she was finally meeting her idol.

'I didn't have the heart to tell her I wasn't her, so I just stood there and tried to copy her [Margot's] smile,' she recalled.

When asked if she was annoyed at the constant comparisons to the blonde bombshell, Samara said: 'Are you kidding? No, it's flattering. I love Margs. She's the best!'

Samara is currently filming her new Hulu series, Nine Perfect Strangers, in New South Wales' Byron Bay.

Samara revealed: 'I've tried saying, "No, it's not who you think it is," but because I also have an Australian accent, people still think I'm Margot and that she's being really rude. Now I just stand there like her'

It is based on the 2018 novel by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.

Despite her soaring public profile, Samara recently told The Daily Telegraph channelling her emotions into characters helps alleviate her anxiety disorder.

Flattered: When asked if she was annoyed at the constant comparisons to the blonde bombshell, Samara said: 'Are you kidding? No, it's flattering. I love Margs. She's the best!'

'Oh, I am still terribly awkward. I have general anxiety disorder, so that's never really going to go away,' she said.

'But I am very grateful that I have an outlet for that, which is my job, so I can use these emotions. Sometimes it's a way to escape that, and it's very helpful for me.

'So that nervous, shy child I think is always there, but I have developed tools and methods to cope with it.' 

Samara first gained public recognition for her role as Indi Walker on the Australian soap, Home and Away.
