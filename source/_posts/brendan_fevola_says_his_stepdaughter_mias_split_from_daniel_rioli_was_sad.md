Brendan Fevola's stepdaughter, Mia, split from Richmond Tigers star Daniel Rioli in February after two years of dating.

And on Sunday, the former AFL  star, 39, said Mia's break up was 'sad' because Daniel was 'part of our family'.

'He was part of our family for a long time, and lived with us for a long time. It was sad to see him go,' Brendan told the Herald Sun.

'He was so good with our kids. Before lockdown, Daniel would take them bowling, or to the movies. The kids loved him, and they still do. He grew up with them.'

Brendan went on to say him and his wife Alex are both still in regular contact with the Richmond Tiger's star.

'I still text Daniel every week to say good luck with the game. Alex texts him before every game, too,' he said.

'Daniel and I are no longer together; however, we still love and care for each other very much and remain the best of friends,' she wrote on Instagram.

Daniel, 22, also addressed the split on his own Instagram account. 

'Hey guys, I know everyone is wondering what's going on with Mia and myself and I hate to say this but we are no longer together,' he wrote.

'But we both love each other and still remain close as best friends and hopefully you guys can respect that.' 

Mia is the eldest child of Brendan's longtime partner, Alex.

The former footy star adopted Mia as his own daughter after he married Alex in 2005, and they have remained close even during times when the couple were separated.

Aside from Mia, Brendan and Alex share three daughters, Leni, Lulu, and Tobi.
