Her story: In an open and honest Instagram post, the Love Island star recalled the changes she's made in her life both physically and mentally and how it's helped her for the better

'This exact date last year I was seriously low and clasping at straws to find ways to get myself feeling better. To look back at where I was then and where I am now, it’s almost like I’m looking at two different people. 

'Not even just physically, but mentally I know how far I've come. I had the worst anxiety, falling asleep thinking about death every night, zero purpose, zero motivation, in denial about my relationship with alcohol, food & most importantly, myself.

'My life has been turned absolutely upside down - and for the better.' 

Speaking further about her experience, Alexandra continued: 'All I wanted to do was strive to be the best version of myself. It’s been hard - I won’t sugarcoat it. 

'The maintenance has been hardest part. Learning to trust myself whilst being in lockdown with minimal distractions, moving away from home, sick family members, wanting to raid the cupboard out of boredom, lack of human connection... 

'Constantly having to remind myself WHY I started. Eventually the new habits I’d made have become a LIFESTYLE and I’m so proud of the person I’ve become. 

'The fact I’m able to inspire others achieve the best version of themselves just fills me with so much joy & so incredibly rewarding - it’s the best part.'

The social media star went on to inspire others to follow her lead and step out of their comfort zones and added that though she's 'never' be 'perfect', she always gives her 'best'. 

Disappointing: However, Alexandra later revealed on Instagram stories that she had received some negative criticism from her post, branding the backlash 'toxic' and '2 dimensional'

She continued: 'It’s ok not to have everything figured out... just taking that first step is what matters. Having the courage to step outside your comfort zone might be the best step you’ll ever take!!!  

'It’s taken a lot of graft, patience, learning, understanding, trust, strength. But ultimately, the end goal has been worth every second. I am only just getting started. I’m not perfect, I never will be. But I will always give my best. And that’s good enough for me.

'Once you find out your ‘why’ things become a little clearer. Believe that you can. Trust yourself. Commit to yourself. YOU DESERVE IT!

'I can’t wait to continue this journey with you and give you everything I’ve got - knowledge, workouts, motivation, giggles.'

Alexandra's heartfelt post was met with a plethora of comments from fans who praised her for sharing her story.

Shock: She went on to say that her post was documenting not just her physical change, but her mental one too, stating that in the past she dreamt about death
