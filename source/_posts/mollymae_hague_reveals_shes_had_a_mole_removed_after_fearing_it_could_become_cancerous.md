Molly-Mae Hague has revealed she had a mole on her leg removed after fearing it could become cancerous.

Following the procedure, the Love Island star, 21, took to Instagram Stories to post a snap of her bandaged scar, explaining she decided to have it removed after getting multiple doctors' opinions about whether it could become cancerous.

Earlier this month Molly-Mae tearfully recalled her cancer scare after visiting a doctor three times to have her mole examined, but reassured fans it turned out to be non-cancerous.

Scary: The Love Island star, 21, took to Instagram Stories to share a snap of her scar following the procedure, after getting several different doctors' opinions about the mole

Molly-Mae shared a snap of the bandage on her leg, writing: 'So this is what I've been up to today...

'Some of you may remember me talking about the mole that was here a few weeks ago on my story. 

'Not going to go into too much detail until I have my results back next week but this just goes to show how important getting different doctors' opinions is.

'So relieved to have it gone, I'll keep you all updated. I just need to share this because I can't stress the important of this situation enough.'

Scary: Three weeks earlier the star tearfully told fans about her recent cancer scare after noticing the mole on her calf

In the post Molly-Mae also included a snap of the original mole on her leg to show the true extent of the procedure.

Three weeks earlier the star tearfully told fans about her recent cancer scare after noticing the mole on her calf.

Molly-Mae added that it was her mum Debbie who first noticed the mole while she was in the Love Island villa, before pleading with her fans to get any unusual marks checked out.

Candid: In a series of videos she posted to Instagram Stories, Molly-Mae admitted she'd been moved to tears after watching a Stand Up To Cancer segment about Emily Hayward

In a series of videos she posted to Instagram Stories, Molly-Mae admitted she'd been moved to tears after watching a Stand Up To Cancer segment about Emily Hayward.

Emily died in June 2018 after being diagnosed with skin cancer seven years earlier when she was just 17, and documented her battle with the disease on a YouTube channel.

Molly-Mae then told her followers she'd found a similar mole on her calf when she was in the Love Island villa last year.

She explained: 'And I actually found a mole on the back of my calf about a year or so ago and had it checked, obviously I'm so blessed that mine wasn't cancerous, but it just made me so upset that like ''what does she do to deserve that? Who deserves that?''

'It is just the worst thing in the world. It's just to comprehend for families that have to go through it, how much of a struggle it must be for people who actually deal with cancer. It just broke my heart watching that.'

Concern: Molly-Mae then told her followers she'd found a similar mole on her calf when she was in the Love Island villa last year

Molly-Mae went onto urge her followers to get any unusual moles checked out, and shared a snap of the one she'd noticed on her calf.

She said: 'Get your moles checked out people!!! It is so unbelievably important. I've had this checked three times now by different consultants just to be sure.

'This just appeared out of nowhere for me and my mum actually noticed it when I was on Love Island through watching me on TV...' 

Close call: After reassuring fans that her mole turned out to be non-cancerous, she urged them to get any unusual marks checked out 

Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. It happens after the DNA in skin cells is damaged (typically due to harmful UV rays) and then not repaired so it triggers mutations that can form malignant tumors. 

Around 15,900 new cases occur every year in the UK, with 2,285 Britons dying from the disease in 2016, according to Cancer Research UK statistics. 

Causes

Treatment 

This can be done by removing the entire section of the tumor or by the surgeon removing the skin layer by layer. When a surgeon removes it layer by layer, this helps them figure out exactly where the cancer stops so they don't have to remove more skin than is necessary. 

The patient can decide to use a skin graft if the surgery has left behind discoloration or an indent. 

This is needed if the cancer reaches stage III or IV. That means that the cancerous cells have spread to the lymph nodes or other organs in the body.
