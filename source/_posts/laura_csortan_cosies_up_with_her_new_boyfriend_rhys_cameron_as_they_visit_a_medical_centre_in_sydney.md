Laura Csortan was spotted with her rumoured new boyfriend, Rhys Cameron, four years after splitting from her three-year-old daughter Layla Rose's father.

The model, 43, wrapped her arms around her new man as the pair visited a medical centre in Sydney's Rose Bay on Thursday.

The couple wore face masks as they arrived to the clinic, just one week after Laura revealed she needs to have surgery on her hand after a 'glass shattered and wedged itself in a ligament'.

Last week, Lauren revealed she needs surgery after glass shattered in her hand while doing housework. 

'Proof that housework is bad for your health. Recently while cleaning up at home a glass shattered in my hand while washing up and has wedged itself in a ligament causing my finger to lose full range of motion,' she wrote on Instagram.

'Anywho... here I am now being super COVID safe at the hospital to have surgery on this hand, Pfffft screw you house work, yo dangerous, I quit (ha, I wish),' she said.

In July 2017, Laura hit back at The Sunday Telegraph over false accusations she was dating celebrity accountant Anthony Bell, and that he was the father of her only child.

Laura took to Instagram, slamming the publication for its 'cruel insinuation' she was in a relationship with Anthony.

'I woke up this morning to the most hurtful and cruel article. No mother, let alone a single mum should be put through an insinuation like this just because they support a friend unconditionally,' she wrote at the time.

'Layla's father is presently living overseas and does not wish to be dragged through the media. Nor is it anyone's business,' she added. 

Anthony has also made it clear the claims were false, telling The Daily Telegraph: 'There is absolutely no truth to that rumour.'

Laura has always refused to reveal the identity of her daughter's father, saying 'he doesn't want to be involved'.
