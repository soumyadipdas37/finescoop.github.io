Her golden brown hair was tied back into a bun and secured with a polka dot scarf.

She carried a black Louis Vuitton bag in her hand and she decked out one wrist in a slew of bangles.

To complete her fashion forward ensemble, Ashley slipped her feet into a pair of cheetah print pumps.

Tisdale slipped her 5foot3inch frame into a white maxi dress that featured a subtle ruffle design towards the bottom.

Her signature tresses were styled into a myriad of soft waves that perfectly framed her face for the sweet snapshots.

Christopher, who happens to be successful composer, tenderly held onto his wife of six years as they posed prom style for one shot.

He kept in theme with the white color scheme, but gave his look a rocker edge by donning a pair of black trousers.
