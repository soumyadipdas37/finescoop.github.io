As an 11-year-old already deep into his tennis development, Felix Auger-Aliassime was taken on a trip from his home in Quebec City to sample the US Open.

As luck would have it, the night session he got to experience back in 2011 featured Andy Murray, 12 months before he would win the singles event.

Murray was heavily freighted then with the expectation that he would become a Grand Slam champion, which is not entirely different for the 20-year-old Canadian, who sits at No 21 in the rankings.

Felix Auger-Aliassime will represent a hugely difficult opponent for Andy Murray at US Open



Many judges believe that, when they meet in the second round, we will be seeing a past World No 1 up against one of the future.

Much will depend on how Murray can physically rebound from the sapping four hours and 40 minutes it took to come back and defeat Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka, a huge test of the medical technology that is holding his hip together.

Another factor will be how the younger player can get his head round facing someone who left a lasting impression on him on that evening in New York nine years ago.

'I was just a kid,' recalled Auger-Aliassime. 'We got tickets for Arthur Ashe Stadium and Andy was playing Feliciano Lopez in a night match. I got to see him there in the third round. That was a big memory of mine, I was actually here.

'It's crazy to feel there's not going to be me as a kid in the stadium watching, it's actually going to be me playing, it's a nice feeling. I watched the whole of his recovery. It's good to see him playing good again and healthy. It's an honour for me to face up with a guy like Andy.'

Having seen off Nishioka and persuaded locker room attendants to let him use what is meant only to be an emergency ice bath, Murray pronounced himself happy enough with his physical condition.

'I felt way better today at the end of that match than I did when I played Bautista Agut in Australia,' said Murray, referring to his previous Grand Slam match, the five-set epic in early 2019 which threatened to be the last of his career. 'I'm not sitting here with my hip throbbing and aching. I'll be able to sleep fine tonight.

'It was emotional after the match finished. To look at my phone, see messages from family and friends, the team and stuff. They're the people who have seen me go through everything, seen the tough times. I don't know how many of us actually believed I'd be back winning matches like that.'

Murray believes 20-year-old Auger-Aliassime will go on to have an 'excellent career'

Auger-Aliassime is in the vanguard of the unlikely surge in tennis talent coming out of Canada. It also produced last year's women's champion Bianca Andreescu, 2016 Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic and another potential major winner in 21-year-old Denis Shapovalov.

The theme running through them, as it so often does in tennis, is that of coming from families where at least one parent has moved to their country in pursuit of a better life and opportunities.

Auger-Aliassime's father, Sam, is originally from Togo and his mother is a school teacher in Quebec. When he reached the world's top 200 having just turned 17 he was the youngest male player to do so since Rafael Nadal. Murray has been duly impressed.

'He's a top, top young player. He'll have an excellent career for sure. He's been really good since he was very young. I think physically he's a fantastic mover, good athlete.

'He hits a big ball but he's had some struggles with his serve at times. That's something I'll look to capitalise on.'
