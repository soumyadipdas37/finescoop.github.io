Eoin Morgan declared himself in the form of his life after inspiring England to their highest T20 run-chase on home soil with a superb 66 off just 33 balls against Pakistan.

His team won by five wickets, knocking off their target of 196 in the last over as Dawid Malan finished unbeaten on 54. 

But it was Morgan who stole the show, giving England a 1-0 lead going into Tuesday's series finale.

Asked if he was hitting the ball as sweetly as he has ever done during his 14-year international career, Morgan replied: ‘Definitely, and the numbers back that up in the last two years. I have experience and I’m more comfortable with the roles that I play.

‘Before I became captain, I didn’t feel that comfortable with jumping up and down the order, but now that it’s my decision I feel more at ease.’

Since the start of the 2019 summer, Morgan’s T20 stats are astonishing: 465 runs at 58, with a strike-rate of 185, with almost as many sixes (32) as fours (36). 

‘It’s just nice that I’m feeling good and it’s actually replicated in the numbers as well,’ he said.

Morgan admitted he was still unsure of his best XI ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup in India, but was relaxed about the prospect, especially with players from the Test bubble set to be named on Monday for the 20-over and one-day series against Australia, starting on Friday in Southampton.

The likes of Jos Buttler, Jason Roy – who is missing the Pakistan series with a side niggle – Jofra Archer, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood are all in the mix for what could be a pair of 14-man squads. The T20 series begins in Southampton on Friday, before the 50-over games in Manchester.

But, with the selectors – including Morgan – due to meet on Sunday night, he would not be drawn on Joe Root’s chances of playing his first T20 international since May 2019, despite a lively 64 off 40 balls for Yorkshire against Derbyshire at Headingley.
