The Austin, Texas born beauty has been spending plenty of time riding horses as of late, as she's taken to Instagram with posts documenting her fun time outdoors.

In one post, she stood in front of a fence where multiple horses were walking around, writing, 'sans saddle.'

In another she, she posed alongside a horse and posted a play on words, writing, 'eques-twins.'

Heard remains immersed in her legal fight with ex-husband Johnny Depp, as the stars have been at odds since their 2016 parting.

In control: The Austin, Texas born star's equestrian form was tip-top on the fall day

After Depp, 57, launched a $50 million defamation suit against her in Fairfax County, Virginia, Heard countersued him last month for $100 million claiming in court docs he 'controlled and/or manipulated' a 'smear campaign' aimed at her that involved social media, People reported.

Heard said in court docs that Depp and his reps 'orchestrated a false and defamatory smear campaign' aimed at her reputation.

'This stream of false and defamatory accusations against Ms. Heard is all an attempt to ruin her life and career, simply because she was a victim of domestic abuse and violence at the hands of Mr Depp,' her legal team said.
