Eddie Redmayne has confirmed filming has resumed on the third Fantastic Beasts movie. 

Production on the next instalment of the wizarding fantasy was hit by a delay in 2019,  but the actor, 38, revealed on Sunday that production has begun once again.

The star, who plays the leading role of magizoologist Newt Scamander, said the cast and crew are being tested for the virus 'frequently' while working on the follow-up to 2018's Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.  

They're back! Eddie Redmayne confirmed on Sunday that Fantastic Beasts 3 has resumed production as he revealed the cast wear masks and are tested 'frequently' for COVID-19

Eddie admitted he was concerned that filming with masks would impact their 'creativity', but insisted everyone has been 'working at the top of their game'. 

He explained to CinemaBlend.com: 'It's interesting because we've started shooting now. We're two weeks in, and again, it's a whole new process. It's a whole new normal. 

'Testing frequently, masks. And I wondered, actually, whether the masks would affect creativity, in some ways.'

Saying his concerns were 'ignorant', as he continued: 'What is really reassuring is that it is a different process, but it still feels like it's fizzing and that everyone is working at the top of their game.'

Dan Fogler, who plays Jacob Kowalski in the Harry Potter spin-off, claimed earlier this year that the third film is 'bigger' than the last two movies put together and they didn't want to 'rush' it.  

He said at the time: 'Yeah, we start in the Fall. The movie is going to be gigantic! The reason we were given is that the movie is bigger than the first two combined.

'They needed more time to prep and they didn't want to rush anything so they pushed it back.'  

The plot is expected to focus on the complex relationship between Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) and Dumbledore (Jude Law). 

'New normal': Eddie explained, 'It's interesting because we've started shooting now. We're two weeks in, and again, it's a whole new process... Testing frequently, masks'

David Yates will direct the film, with J.K. Rowling, David Heyman, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram producing once again. 

Award-winning author Rowling revealed back in June last year that she had started penning the script for the next Fantastic Beasts instalment. 

She tweeted: 'I've just finished the fourth Galbraith novel, 'Lethal White', and I'm now writing the screenplay for Fantastic Beasts 3.' 

There are set to be five movies based on Scamander. The first movie in the saga, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came out in 2016.
