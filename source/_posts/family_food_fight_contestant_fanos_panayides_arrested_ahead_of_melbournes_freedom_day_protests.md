Former Family Food Fight star Fanos Panayides has been arrested in Melbourne as police crackdown ahead of protests planned for this weekend.

On Wednesday, The Age identified the 38-year-old as one of two men charged the previous day, with incitement for allegedly encouraging others to take part in a prohibited anti-lockdown protest in the CBD.

Panayides is a leader of an online group called 99 Unite, who are spreading dangerous conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic and are urging followers to reject COVID-19 tests.

Panayides often goes live on social media to share his dangerous and misleading theories.

'I'm going to run some facts by all the muppets out there who think they are doing the right thing and the government is taking care of them,' he added, before claiming the flu was more deadly then COVID-19.
