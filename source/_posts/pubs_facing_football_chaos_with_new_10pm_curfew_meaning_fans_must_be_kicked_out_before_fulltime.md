Pubs are set for chaotic scenes when having to kick out football fans watching matches before full time, in compliance with new curfew rules. 

The government have introduced a mandatory 10:00pm closing time for pubs across Britain in a bid to restrict the spread of coronavirus, a move that has baffled and enraged many.  

Liverpool's big game against Arsenal on Monday night kicks off at 8:15pm and will therefore finish after 10:00pm. 

Fans watching in pubs will be kicked out before games are over to comply with curfew rules

Liverpool's clash with Arsenal on Monday night is a big fixture fans could miss the end of

Those wanting to watch the game at a pub will miss what may be dramatic closing moments of the match as they are thrown out before the conclusion. 

With no fans able to attend games inside the stadiums, pubs have increasingly been the option for fans to gain a sense of community and watch their teams. 

Kick-offs have been staggered to allow for spectators to watch more games, meaning the last matches kick-off later than in the past. 

If there are dramatic closing stages of the game, there could be chaos in pubs 

Strict new rules that were enforced in the north east from Friday for their contained lockdown hint at what is to come. Pubs were taking last orders at 9:30pm with all customers out by 10:00pm. 

The new curfew rules set to take effect from Thursday will penalise those without a subscription to Sky or BT Sport as they will not be able to watch the games.  

On Thursday, Liverpool take on Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup and Manchester City meet Bournemouth. Both games kick off at 19:45pm and fans watching in pubs could well miss the final stages if the matches go to penalties.
