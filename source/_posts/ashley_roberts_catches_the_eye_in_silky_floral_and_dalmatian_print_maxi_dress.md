The blonde beauty showed off her incredible physique in a matching two-piece while posing for the playful image. 

Referencing her birthday and Britain's unseasonably warm September weather in an accompanying caption, she wrote: 'Ring Ring: Alexa says it’s 30 degrees and my birthday hunni’s. Thank you for all your lovely messages!!!'

Earlier that day Ashley admitted she had been spoiled with cakes, champagne and cards from her extended family at Heart Radio after turning up for her role as showbiz correspondent.
