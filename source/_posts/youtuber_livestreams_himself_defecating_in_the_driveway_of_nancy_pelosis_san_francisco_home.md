A YouTuber appeared to defecate in the driveway of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home in a video livestreamed over the weekend. 

In the footage that was recorded on Saturday, the man identifies himself as  Armando as he walks through a few San Francisco streets in search of the Democrat's home. 

Once he finds her residence, he set up a camera across the street and walked over to her driveway. 

Armando then saluted his viewers, pulled down his pants and squatted in the driveway.

After a few seconds, Armando stands to his feet and wipes his buttocks before walking away and leaving behind what appeared to be feces. 

'That was for President Trump,' Armando is heard telling his viewers. 

The video, which is titled 'Poopalosi', was shared on the YouTube star's page and has more than 20,000 views as of Monday morning. A short time later, Armando shared another livestream titled, 'I'm gonna need a lawyer.'

In that video, Armando claimed that he was detained by the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police at the request of the Capitol Police department. 

'It was scary, man,' he said in the second video. 'They asked me about Kamala Harris, and about how I joked on the stream that if she lived in San Francisco I'd sh*t on her house too. They weren't f**king playing.'

According to the New York Post, a Twitter account claiming to be that of Armando apologized for the incident. 

'@SpeakerPelosi I know you may not ever see this but I want you to know, I meant no foul harm yesterday when I did what I did. I’m not proud of it at all and I just would like for you to know that. I have no ill will against you or anyone in an elected officials position,' the now deleted tweet reads. 

According to Armando's YouTube page, he is an aspiring filmmaker who has backpacked across the US.
