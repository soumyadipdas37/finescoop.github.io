He was seen at the end of August for the first time in months looking completely unrecognisable as he deals with his health issues.

And Ozzy Osbourne was seen again on Friday as he chatted to pals outside a home in Beverly Hills.

The Black Sabbath rocker, 71, cut a dapper figure in a smart grey coat, while he leaned on his cane for support amid his battle with Parkinson's disease.

Ozzy appeared in good spirits as he mingled outside the house, sporting a stylish grey coat with black leather sleeves.

The now grey-haired rocker at one point leaned on a wall for support amid his low-key outing.  

The Prince Of Darkness is known for his long mane of dark brown hair, but -as seen in the end of August- he's currently grey-haired and tied his hair back in a ponytail. 

Ozzy went public this January with his Parkinson's battle, after being diagnosed with the disease in February 2019.

He announced in February that he was canceling the North American leg of his No More Tours II concert gigs, owing to an excruciating neck injury. 

What's more, he suffered a fall last year and required spinal surgery, ultimately scrapping his tour dates for 2019. 

Ozzy was meant to hit the road again this year, but scrapped the North American leg of his tour so that he could seek treatment in Switzerland - only for the coronavirus lockdowns to leave him confined to his home and unable to travel to Europe. 

Although Ozzy has not been seen out in public in months, he did appear with his family on Celebrity Watch Party with a finale that aired July 23rd.

The reality show is a take-off of the UK show Gogglebox and offers a glimpse at celebrities in their homes watching and reacting to TV.  

Prior to that, he was seen in January, looking a little more like his old self, when he attended the Grammys with a walking cane alongside his daughter Kelly.

Despite his recent health crises and reduced mobility, the father-of-six and former reality star has repeatedly declared that he will never abandon showbusiness or rock and roll.

'You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I'll f***ing do an encore. I'm the Prince of Darkness,' he said . 

The Black Sabbath rocker admitted he has found it tough staying at home throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as he opened up about his mental health.  

Speaking on The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, he said: 'When I am in a room on my own, it is a bad f****** place. Our heads are our worst enemies in times like this because people are locked up and worried about this pandemic.'

They need to unload because if you do not unload, you'll get depressed. My therapist suggested that I start meditating again. I am on this new antidepressant which is working wonders.'  

As for his Parkinson's diagnosis, the rocker shared that he is making progress, explaining: 'I'm feeling better every day. It's so slow. I go in the swimming pool for an hour every day. I work out every day ... It catches up with you in the end'.

'I've got no complaints. I've had a great career. I had a great time. And I ain't done yet ... As soon as I get back on my feet I'll go out. I can't wait. Pandemic or not, I can't wait ... I will be happy as well. If my life ended on a stage, so be it. That's the place I belong.'
