Abigail Spencer looked effortlessly chic, as she ran errands in a breezy Meghan Markle-inspired olive green dress on Wednesday. 

Bearing a striking resemble to her longtime pal, the 39-year-old actress was seen chatting away on her phone in a belted frock, which emphasized her trim waist. 

While strutting around Brentwood in a pair of chic black sandals, the raven-haired beauty kept a fringed suede purse on her shoulder.

The Timeless star accessorized her classic ensemble with tortoiseshell sunglasses and her lengthy dark brown hair styled in bouncy waves. 

Despite covering the majority of her face under a face mask, Spencer appeared in high sprits and completely recovered from her broken wrist. 

She underwent surgery in May, after her attempt at performing a back handspring for a coronavirus relief video led to a painful injury.
