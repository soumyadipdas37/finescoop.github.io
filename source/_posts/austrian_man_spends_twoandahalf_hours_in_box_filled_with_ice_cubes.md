An Austrian man has beaten his own record for the longest full body contact with ice cubes.

Sportsman Josef Koeberl managed to stay for two hours, 30 minutes and 57 seconds inside a custom-made glass box filled up to his shoulders with ice cubes.

More than 200 kilograms of ice cubes were needed to fill up the box, after Mr Koeberl stepped inside wearing nothing but swimming trunks.

In order to fight the 'wave of pain' caused by the freezing temperatures, Mr Koeberl says he was trying to focus on positive emotions.

'I'm fighting the pain by visualising and drawing on positive emotions so I can dampen this wave of pain,' Mr Koeberl told reporters. 'That way I can endure.'

Mr Koeberl is planning to beat his own record one more time — next year in Los Angeles.

His team said that his personal record is also the current world record when it comes to exposing the body to ice for as long as possible.
