He confirmed last month that he will welcome migrants to come and live in his Surrey mansion.

And Gary Lineker looked relaxed as he enjoyed a low-key outing near his London home on Sunday.

He stepped out after confirming that he has offered up his London home for migrants to live in after they cross the Channel -  calling out a Tory MP who accused him of virtue signalling.

In mid-August Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, 53, slammed the Match of the Day host for discussing the record number of migrants who have arrived in the UK on boats this year. 

But Lineker kicked him into touch after announcing online he had offered to house some through the charity Refugees At Home after being asked by one Twitter user about it.  

It came after an interview with Talk Radio, where host Mike Graham asked Anderson what he would say to people like Lineker, who 'like to virtue signal on social media talking about how we should be a welcoming country'.

 Anderson joked the former professional footballer could email him his address 'and I will make sure that's available for the next boat of illegal immigrants to come and live in.' 

Gary then revealed he has been in touch with charity Refugees at Home to offer to host a refugee or asylum seeker in his five-bedroom property.  

At least 4,375 migrants have reached the UK by small boat so far this year - including some 825 this month.

Lineker, who is worth an estimated £28million and is the BBC's highest paid sports pundit, lives in a luxurious five-bedroom home in Barnes, south west London.

Refugees at Home connects those with a spare room to refugees and asylum seekers in need of somewhere to stay.  

Anderson went on to slam the pundit as 'the liberal left', claiming Lineker seeks popularity by sharing the 'right messages' online.
