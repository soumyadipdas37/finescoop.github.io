Pep Guardiola revealed that Manchester City will be without both Sergio Aguero and Aymeric Laporte for their season curtain-raiser at Wolves.

Laporte only returned to training on Friday following self-isolation on the back of a positive coronavirus test.

Aguero's knee injury means he is undergoing sessions alone and yet to link up with the rest of Guardiola's squad.

It leaves City without two of their best players for a trip to Molineux against a Wolves team that did the double over them last term.

'Riyad (Mahrez) came back (from self-isolation) four days ago and today was the first day Aymeric is coming back,' Guardiola said.

'Riyad will be available, Laporte not yet. Aguero has not made one training session with us.'

Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling are Guardiola's options through the middle and Laporte's absence at the back could mean a debut for the £40million summer signing.

Ake might have been joined by Lionel Messi as the Argentine attempted to engineer a way out of Barcelona. City had been cautiously optimistic of landing Messi before his exit was blocked.

Guardiola added: 'I don't have to explain anything. Leo explained it quite well, his feelings. I don't have anything to add. He is at Barcelona, a club I love.'

City could yet be busy in the transfer window before it shuts on October 5 as they hunt for a centre half, with the futures of a number of existing players up in the air.

Guardiola suggested the next fortnight could be busy at the Etihad Stadium. 'Since day one, when I arrived here, I am more than satisfied on what I had. I know the club do absolutely everything to do their best for all of us,' he said.

'If it happens then it'll happen, we could move someone – because sometimes the player decide to leave. I'll never complain about this (transfers). I'm a lucky person to have these players.'
