Sydney publicist Karen walked down the aisle while The Voice star Prinnie Stevens sung Ellie Goulding's single How Long Will I Love you.

 'It's the day we wanted, [it was] perfect,' she told WHO magazine.

The couple had planned to wed on April 9, but they had to postpone their plans due to the coronavirus restrictions.

Bruce and Karen started dating in 2017, 12 months after he divorced from his ex-wife Stacey Woods after just one year of marriage.

After first meeting at a mutual friend's birthday party,  the couple moved in together after six months of dating.

Bruce proposed to Karen while the couple were holidaying in Cuba in June 2019, and he announced the happy news on Instagram.

Meanwhile, the lifeguard, who owns Chapter One eatery in Bondi, announced he had split from partner of three years Stacey in March 2016.

He said at the time: 'We tried to work on things but it was all over when she finally told me she just wasn't in love anymore.'

'I think if she was in love with me, she fell out of love.' 

Bruce also confessed to Woman's Day, he 'regrets' giving his former flame a second chance after she left him at the altar in December 2013.

'I regret going through with the marriage now - but I made that decision to take her back and marry her so I have to stand by that,' he told the publication.
