Along with her co-host Piers Morgan, she's been off TV screens since July, enjoying a well-earned rest. 

And, on Monday, Susanna Reid shared a bare-faced selfie to Instagram as she prepared to return to Good Morning Britain after her summer break.

The presenter, 49, admitted she was looking forward to having her 'glam squad' back after weeks of going make-up free, as she displayed her natural beauty in the snap.

Susanna, who looked stunning in the stripped back photograph, wrote alongside: 'Last bare-faced day of the summer! 

'Tomorrow the Glam Squad is back... and I am SO looking forward to seeing them. See you tomorrow @GMB.'

It comes after Susanna and Holly Willoughby, 39, led the daytime hosts sharing snaps from their time in lockdown ahead of their return to work in September, since taking a step back from their respective shows in July.

ITV's leading ladies joined the likes of Piers Morgan, Phillip Schofield and Lorraine Kelly in a promotional video as they 'adjust to a new normal' before they make a comeback to screens on September 1 amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Teasing fans what they've been up to during the COVID-19 crisis, Loose Women’s Christine Lampard, Andrea McLean, Nadia Sawalha, Brenda Edwards, Stacey Solomon and Judi Love also feature in social media posts.  

'We’ve had a hair cut', Susanna said, while Piers and Holly added: 'And a pint. We've been reunited with loved ones' as they detailed their time away from their work duties.

During the break, Good Morning Britain has been hosted by Kate Garraway, Ben Shephard, Adil Ray, Ranvir Singh, Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher, and Christine and Andi Peters filled in for Scottish presenter Lorraine's eponymous show.

Meanwhile, This Morning was fronted by Ruth Langsford, Eamonn Holmes, Rochelle Humes, Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond.
