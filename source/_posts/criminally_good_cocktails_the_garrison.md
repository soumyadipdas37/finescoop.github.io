Can't wait for Peaky Blinders to return to TV? Get your fix with these tipples inspired by the Birmingham gangsters.  

To make The Garrison cocktail, pour gin, syrup, lemon juice and liqueur into a shaker filled with ice. Mix and strain into a cocktail glass

The Garrison pub is bought by Thomas for his brother to run. The barmaid who works there, Grace Burgess (Annabelle Wallis), is both tart and sweet, like the flavours in this cocktail. 

She catches Thomas's eye, and even though she's working undercover with the police, she falls in love with him. 

For 1 glass – Preparation: 5 minutes

Pour the gin, syrup, lemon juice and liqueur into a shaker filled with ice. Mix and strain into a cocktail glass.

Garnish with a blackberry.
