Chris Jordan has backed Jofra Archer to bowl even faster after England unsettled Australia’s batsmen with raw pace during Friday night’s T20 heist in Southampton.

Archer kickstarted Australia’s remarkable collapse of six for 50 in eight overs by dismissing the tourists’ captain, Aaron Finch, with a delivery timed at 93mph, and then yorked the dangerous David Warner for 58. 

With Mark Wood touching 95mph at the other end, the Australians began to panic – and ended up losing by two runs.

‘Jofra really looked like he was enjoying himself out there,’ said Jordan, who had been presented with a special cap by Archer before the game to mark his 50th T20 appearance for England. ‘I started to tease him when he touched 92mph whether he could touch 95.

‘You only had to see how the Aussie batters were reacting to the ball: it messed up their feet movement. Jofra and Woody put on a show, going through their repertoire, bowling quick and really unsettling batsmen. 

‘It means they had to take a risk against Rash [Adil Rashid], because they didn’t feel they were getting anything off Jof and Woody.’

England were planning to unleash their two quickest bowlers again today as they look to clinch the three-match series at the earliest opportunity against the top-ranked side in T20 cricket. 

And if they are yet to find a solution to their lack of wicket-taking prowess in the powerplay, they are overflowing with options at the death.

‘Over the last few years especially, a lot of the talk has been about the batting line-up and how phenomenal it is,’ said Jordan. ‘But it was nice that the bowlers bailed the batters out, and Tom Curran’s final over was brilliant. He held his nerve and stayed as calm as possible.’

With characteristic modesty, Jordan played down his own contribution after conceding just four singles in the 19th over, and running out Ashton Agar. 

But he has become an integral part of the T20 side in the six and a half years since his debut, and now has more wickets in the format (61) than any England bowler apart from Stuart Broad (65).

In a game of the finest possible margins, he also played his part with the bat, taking 10 off the last over of the England innings from Pat Cummins, including a pull for four off the final delivery.

The morning after the night before, Cummins was still trying to work out how Australia had thrown away victory when they needed only 39 from 35 balls with nine wickets in hand.

Pat Cummins claims Australia should have won the T20 match given the position they were in

‘For 80 or 90 per cent of the game, we played really well and we were on top,’ he said. ‘It is a shame, and something we have to try and get better at. It has happened a few times and I am sure every one of us will review it in our own way. 

‘For sure, we should be winning just about every game when we are in that position.’

Meanwhile, Jordan welcomed the presence of today’s game on the BBC – the first time an England-Australia match will have been broadcast live on a terrestrial channel since 1997.

‘It’s brilliant,’ said Jordan. ‘It’s a different audience, there might be people who haven’t watched cricket before and there might be people who haven’t had Sky for a while and might have had to watch highlights.

‘The more people we can get watching the game, the better it is for our cricket. There have been some phenomenal games and last night was a thriller. Why not? Let the whole world see it.’
