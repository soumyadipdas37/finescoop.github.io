He returned to Australia three years ago after chasing the Hollywood dream for 25 years. 

And Cameron Daddo, 55, looked very different to his years as a fresh-faced aspiring superstar when he appeared in a new trailer for Home And Away on Monday.  

Looking every inch the smouldering silver fox, Cameron sported a shock of white hair and a matching beard in the trailer.

The star, who kicked off his performing career as a model at the age of 18, now boasts the mature, rugged complexion commonly displayed by Hollywood veterans such as George Clooney.   

Cameron joined the cast of Home And Away in May, playing Evan Slater, the estranged father of Ryder Jackson (Lukas Radovich). 

He left the series in June when his character died from asbestosis, weeks before it was confirmed Cameron would return to the franchise as Evan's secret twin brother Owen.

Monday's trailer shows Owen's shock arrival at Summer Bay, and a glimpse at his fledging romance with his dead brother's widow. 

Of playing two different roles, Cameron told Woman's Day magazine: 'Fortunately, I had some time between playing the two characters. I was able to put Evan 'to bed' and then create the backstory of Owen.' 

'Thankfully, I never played the two at the same time. Now that would have been fun!' he added.

The actor described Evan's death as 'bittersweet' in a recent interview with Digital Spy. 

'I was happy at the beginning that it was going to be a short run, then about 10 weeks in, I wanted to stay because it's so good,' Cameron said.

'I was like, 'Do I have to die? Can we find a cure?' It was bittersweet.'

Cameron and his wife Alison Brahe moved to LA in 1992 in search of Hollywood success. 

While Cameron managed to land small roles in shows such as Models Inc., The Mentalist and NCIS, his goal of a stable Hollywood career never materialised.

The couple, who share three children: daughters Lotus, 24, and Bodhi Faith, 14, and son River, 20, returned to Australia in 2017.
