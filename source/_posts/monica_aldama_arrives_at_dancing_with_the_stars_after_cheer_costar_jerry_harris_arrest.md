Monica Aldama was spotted arriving to work at the Dancing With The Stars studios this Saturday in Los Angeles.

The 50-year-old, who rose to fame as coach on the Netflix reality show Cheer,  made sure to wear a mask as she arrived to the set.

Her latest sighting comes a day after she publicly shared her reaction to the child porn arrest of Cheer star Jerry Harris.

'My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I am devastated by this shocking, unexpected news,' she wrote.

'Our children must be protected from abuse and exploitation, and I'm praying hard for the victims and everyone affected. Please respect our privacy as our family mourns during this heartbreaking time.'

Harris, 21, was arrested by the FBI this Thursday in Chicago and charged with producing child pornography.

Federal court records say he stands accused of trying to get an underage boy 'to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself.'
