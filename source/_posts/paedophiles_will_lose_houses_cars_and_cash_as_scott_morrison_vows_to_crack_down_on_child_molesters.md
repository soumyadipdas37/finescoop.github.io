Child sex offenders will lose their homes, cars and all other assets as federal police are cracking down on the crimes by confiscating property.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton revealed groundbreaking new crime laws on Sunday that will see police take assets of criminals who make money through exploiting children.

'If a sex offender is found to be profiting or seeking to gain from the exploitation of children, they can expect to have their bank account, their home or even their car seized,' he told New Corp.

'We are going to target those who profit from an abhorrent trade in child abuse.'

The Australian Federal Police revealed the 'dark web' servers crashed due to a high demand from Australians who watch children be abused online.

Australians are paying as little as $35 to impoverished parents in poverty-stricken countries to film themselves raping and torturing their own children.

AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw on Sunday promised to 'go after the assets of paedophiles who cash in on the abuse.

'It is truly sickening that offenders are profiting from the abuse, degradation and misery of children,' he wrote on Sunday. 

Mr Kershaw said he would be using the 'full force of the law' to lock the offenders away and 'strip them of their assets'.

'We will never give up in our fight to rescue the victims and unleash maximum damage to those who do our children harm,' he said.

The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) will now be targeting paedophiles with a new and 'aggressive stragety'.

CACT will follow online money trails by using police, lawyers, financial investigators and forensic accountants.

'If a child sex predator is profiting or seeking to gain from the exploitation of children, their home, their car, their bank accounts and other assets are at risk of being seized by CACT's team of litigators, financial investigators, forensic accountants and analysts,' Mr Kershaw wrote.

'The CACT is highly skilled at what they do, and are relentless and determined in their pursuit for justice.'

On Sunday the AFP revealed the surge in photos and videos of child abuse viewed by Australians had crashed internet servers.

'Australian law enforcement officers observed sites hosting online sexual abuse material crashing since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increased volume of traffic,' AFP Assistant Commissioner Lesa Gale said. 

Dark web forums saw traffic more than double on forums with child sex material during Australia-wide lockdowns this year. 

Between July 2019 and May this year, the AFP laid 1078 Commonwealth Child Exploitation charges against 144 people.
