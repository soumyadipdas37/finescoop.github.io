She bared all for a good cause on The All New Monty: Guys & Gals on Sunday night.

And on Monday, radio presenter Ash Pollard took a stroll with her baby daughter, whose name she is yet to reveal, near her home on the NSW Central Coast.

The 34-year-old, who welcomed her firstborn on Friday, shared a sweet photo to Instagram of herself pushing her baby in a stroller.

She posed in compression tights and a puffer jacket, and also wore a face mask.

'How do the influencers do it?' she wrote in the caption, adding that her daughter's pram was her 'new wheels'.

'You don't see them rocking compression stockings. Need new gear to reach MILF status,' she added.

Just hours earlier, viewers had watched her strip off on The All New Monty to raise awareness of early detection and prevention of cancer.

The burlesque show had been filmed at Sydney's Enmore Theatre in March, at about the same time she discovered she was pregnant.

She was joined on stage by the likes of showbiz legend Patti Newton, Home and Away star Sam Frost, singer Danielle Spencer and model Erin Holland.

The pair have been together for two years, and Ash announced her pregnancy to her boyfriend live on stage while filming The All New Monty.

Monday's post comes after Ash announced the birth of her first child on Friday.

She shared a black-and-white image of herself cradling the newborn, who was seen grabbing Pete's finger while lying on Ash's chest under a blanket.

'She's here! #Obsessed,' the former reality star wrote in the caption.
