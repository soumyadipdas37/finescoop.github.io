A student from an elite Catholic school was held face-down and sexually assaulted with a carrot on a school rugby trip, a court heard.

The boy from Trinity College, in Perth, was then tormented in the months after the assault by his alleged attackers on social media.

Schoolboys allegedly taunted the victim with pictures of carrots and giant radishes as well as a cartoon of a carrot with his faced on it labelled 'carrot man.'

A doctored magazine cover was also designed by a student featuring a band called 'the carrots' with the single 'Uranus' which was a 'forceful change to the music industry,' reported ABC news. 

The series of events allegedly took place during a school rugby tour to Japan in April 2017.

On the same school trip an anaphylactic child allegedly went missing at the Singapore airport on route to Japan.   

The claims were made during a trial for two of the supervising teachers Ian Francis Hailes and Anthony Paul Webb at Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday.

Both teachers were dismissed after the school trip, and stand accused of failing to make a mandatory report of suspected child sexual abuse.

They pleaded not guilty to the charges during the court appearance this week. 

However the schoolboys accused of sexual abuse are not facing criminal proceedings because of difficulties prosecuting alleged crimes by juveniles from another country in Japan. 

Mr Hailes gave evidence during the trial on Thursday, telling the court he wasn't aware of the sexual assault until months later.

The school trip involved 28 students ranging from years ten to 12 with three teachers present to supervise. 

On each day of the trip students would participate in a 'fines session' where they would be punished for any misdemeanors they committed.

The victim told the court he used one of these sessions to tell the two teachers about the attack, saying: 'I would like to nominate everyone in my room last night. You know what you did.'

He also detailed how the trip was rife with physical violence that resulted in hotel guests lodging noise complaints about the school group. 

Another student who gave evidence told the court he was threatened he would 'be the next' to get the carrot.

But Mr Hailes told the court he had not heard what the victim said, but when he spoke with Mr Webb later understood the incident to involve bullying.

The maths teacher said he was told the boy had a carrot 'put in his pants'.

He said it wasn't until September that he was told an alleged sexual assault had taken place by the school's acting principal Peter Norman. 

The court heard the victim was continually bullied about the incident in the months after the trip (pictured: a text message exchange between students references the alleged attack) 

But between April and September the court heard how the victim was continually bullied by other students both inside and outside the school.    

The allegations come amid recent revelations of bad behaviour at boys' schools.

Shore School, in Sydney's lower north shore, went into damage control after a muck-up day document circulating among Year 12 students was leaked to the public on Tuesday.

Titled the 'Triwizard Shorenament' - a reference to Harry Potter - students were encouraged to participate in a range of illegal activities such as spitting on a homeless man, breaking into Taronga Zoo and taking drugs.
