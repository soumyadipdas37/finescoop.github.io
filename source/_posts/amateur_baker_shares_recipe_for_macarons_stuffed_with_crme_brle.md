An amateur baker has developed a recipe for macarons stuffed with crème brûlée, the iconic French dessert made from vanilla custard and caramelised sugar.

The decadent treats, which were posted anonymously in an Australian Facebook group on Tuesday, can be made with a handful of simple supermarket ingredients like cream, sugar and cornflour, an oven and a piping bag.

Their unique flavour has been hailed as 'very impressive' by a string of home cooks, with many branding the creation an 'awesome' fusion of their favourite desserts.

How to make the crème brûlée filling

The custard filling must be refrigerated for two to three hours, so it's best to make that first.

This can be done by heating a quarter cup of milk and a half cup of cream in a small saucepan right until boiling point, and beating three egg yolks, a quarter cup of sugar and a generous tablespoon of cornflour in a bowl while it warms.

Once fully heated, the cream mixture should be poured into the egg mixture in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.

Then returned to the stovetop on a medium heat and warmed for three to five minutes, again stirring constantly.

Crème brûlée is a dessert that consists of a rich vanilla custard base topped with a hardened layer of caramelised sugar, typically served slightly chilled in individual ramekins.

The earliest known recipe appears in French chef Francois Massialot's cookbook 'Cuisinier royal et bourgeois', which was published in 1691. 

The title 'burnt cream' was used in the English translation, but the dish then vanished from the French culinary scene until the 1980s when it became a 'symbol of the decade's self-indulgence and the darling of the restaurant boom'.

The rebirth of crème brûlée has been credited to New York chef Sirio Maccioni who served it at his midtown Manhattan eatery Le Cirque during that decade.

Once the liquid has thickened into a soft custard, it should be strained through a fine sieve and mixed with vanilla paste for flavour.

You can tell that the custard is ready when it coats the back of a spoon without dripping off.

Leave it to cool at room temperature before spooning it into a piping bag fitted with a plain round nozzle and refrigerating for at least two hours.

How to make the macaron shells

With the filling complete, the shells should be started by sifting one cup of almond flour and two cups of powdered sugar in a large bowl, mixing well until fully combined.

Three egg whites should be beaten in a separate bowl with one teaspoon of cream of tartar then added on top.

Once the egg turns white, it's time to slowly add the sugar, mixing vigorously until stiff peaks form in the mixture.

Flour and a quarter cup of sugar should then be tipped in and folded gently until the mixture gathers a dense, lava-like consistency.

Once this has been achieved, load the mixture into a piping bag and squeeze small discs onto a baking tray covered with grease-proof paper. 

For the shells:

1 cup almond flour

2 cups powdered sugar

1/4 cup sugar

3 egg whites (large eggs room temperature)

1 tsp cream of tartar

For the custard filling:

1/2 cup double cream

1/4 cup milk

1/4 cup sugar

2 large egg yolks

1 1/2 tbsp cornflour

1-1 1/2 tsp vanilla paste or extract

These discs will rise and expand in the oven, creating the shells you need to sandwich the crème brûlée between.

Bake the discs at a searing 300 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes until cooked but barely brown, then cool on a wire tray before matching shells into pairs of similar size.

Finally, the custard filling should be spooned onto one side of the shell and topped with a dollop of caramel sauce which can be bought ready-made from all leading supermarkets.

The caramelised topping can be achieved by sprinkling sugar over one side of each pair of shells and burning it gently with a kitchen blow torch.

Photos of the macarons have drawn delighted responses since they were shared online, with comments including 'delicious', 'looks great' and 'very impressive'. 

'Those are beautiful, I bet they taste amazing,' one woman said.

A second described the sweets as her 'two favourite desserts combined'.
