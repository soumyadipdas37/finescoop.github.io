Pixie Lott proved her summer wasn't entirely wasted on Thursday as she gave fans an update on her latest overseas holiday with model Oliver Cheshire. 

The singer has made the most of relaxed travel restrictions by jetting to the Greek Islands with her hunky fiancé, and she appeared to be completely won over by their breathtaking scenery as they took to Instagram.

Sharing a flurry of images with followers, the happy couple documented their travels across the stunning Kefalonian coastline and luxurious stay at the Emelisse Nature Resort in Fiskardo.
