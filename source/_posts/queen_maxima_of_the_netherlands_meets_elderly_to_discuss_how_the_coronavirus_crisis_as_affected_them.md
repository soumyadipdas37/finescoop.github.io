The Dutch mother-of-three looked radiant in an autumnal dress with long sleeves and an intricate floral motif in brown, black, blue, yellow and white. 

The outfit perfectly framed her curves, with a large statement black belt highlighting her small waist. 

She paired the dress with sensible black leather boots  and kept her accessorises to a minimum, donning only a golden ring on her right hand, a bracelet made of fabric on her left wrist and large black hoop earrings. 

She carried a black cardigan with her in case she needed to wrap up from the September chill.

Zormies provides help to informal carers looking after their loved ones. The services offered span a wide range of activities, such as grocery shopping, and can help informal carer by taking over the care of their loved ones when they need it.

Wearing a pristine powersuit, the Dutch Queen spoke with the centre's staff, who hoped to combat loneliness in Rotterdam by offering several activities. 

The Queen and her husband faced criticism when they were pictured ignoring social distancing rules during their holiday on the Greek Island of Milos in Greece. 

A picture emerged on social media of the couple, who were holidaying with their daughters Princess Amalia, 16, Princess Alexia, 15, and Princess Ariane, 13, posing alongside an unidentified restaurant employee, less than one metre apart.

They took to Twitter to apologise for not practicing the 1.5 metres apart guideline imposed by The Netherlands, in addition to not wearing face masks.

The family had been on holiday for a few weeks and they were praised for their swift action in apologising for their lapse in judgement.
