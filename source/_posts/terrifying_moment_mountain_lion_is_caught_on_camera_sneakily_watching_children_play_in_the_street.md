Talk about a close call. 

A person looking for their cat outside of their California home was shocked to discover a mountain lion scoping out some kids riding their bike nearby. 

The brief clip, filmed in Pacifica on September 19, shows the large predator watching the kids from behind the camera person's first yard gate.

It stares at the kids before noticing the camera person, who screamed at the children and told them to run inside. 

It runs toward the camera before making a quick turn, jumping over the fence and hiding under a nearby truck.

The clip ends showing the large feline hiding under the vehicle as the kids hurry to get inside.

The camera person shared in the video caption that the mountain lion was chased 'off into the side yard and back hill.' 

The cat-lover's own little kitty did eventually come back home a 'few hours later.'
