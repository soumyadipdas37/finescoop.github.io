The Bachelor's Bella Varelis was dumped by Locky Gilbert on the dating show's emotional finale on Thursday night.

And on Friday morning, the aspiring influencer appeared visibly upset whilst discussing the heartbreak on Studio 10.

In photos taken on the set of the talk show, the 25-year-old appeared to wipe away a tear while being interviewed.

While she seemed emotional in behind-the-scenes photos, the brunette beauty was far more composed during the official interview that went to air.

While chatting to hosts Sarah Harris and Tristan MacManus, Bella was measured and mature as she wished Locky and Irena Srbinovska the best in their relationship.

She also confirmed that she's back on the dating market, but is more focused on 'loving myself' than finding a man.
