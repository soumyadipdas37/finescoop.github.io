A candid photo of Elvis Presley holding his baby daughter is one of a collection of never-before-seen images of the King of rock 'n' roll to have been unearthed.

The eight pictures were taken in the late 1960s and early '70s.

One shows Elvis in a sharp blue suit clutching new-born Lisa Marie Presley in 1968.

Other photos are of him riding a horse, holding a bottle of beer while wearing a garish yellow shirt and being driven in a car in Las Vegas dressed in his famous white jumpsuit.

One of the unseen polaroid pictures going up for auction, with 2-8-68 handwritten on the rear, shows Elvis wearing a striking blue suit and holding a young Lisa Marie Presley, his only daughter who was born in February 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee 

The series of photographs were taken in the late 1960s and early 1970s and include this shot of the singer in a garish yellow shirt casually holding a beer. The photos were in a storage lockup for many years before being bought by a British collector

Four of the eight images going up for auction this month show Elvis Presley riding a horse on his ranch in Memphis which are understood to have been taken by an associate of his and have only been viewed by a handful of hardcore Elvis fans

The four other images have only viewed by a handful of hardcore Elvis fans and depict him riding horses on his ranch in Memphis.

It is believed they were taken by an associate of Elvis who worked with him in the music industry.

The photos were placed in a storage lockup for many years before being bought by a British collector.

Now in his advancing years, the unnamed collector has decided to sell them with Omega Auctions of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside.

The collection is expected to fetch up to £600.

A spokesman for Omega said: 'There are four polaroid photographs which, as per their nature, are unique so will all certainly be unseen and unpublished.

'They came from a gentleman who bought the contents of a storage lockup.

'In the lockup there were numerous others items of music related memorabilia that had clearly come from somebody that worked in the music industry during the seventies.

'The chances are that whoever's lockup it was may have taken these photos.

'They are in excellent condition and there is always a big market for unique items of music memorabilia that people have not seen before.'

When the photographs were taken Elvis would have been aged in his early 30s.

The sale takes place on September 8.
