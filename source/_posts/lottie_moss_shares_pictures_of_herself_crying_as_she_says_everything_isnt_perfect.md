She's known for her super glam posts on social media, but Lottie Moss decided to post some content that was a little more 'real' on Instagram on Monday night. 

The model, 22, shared a couple of pictures of herself crying after watching a 'lame' film as she urged her followers to remember that 'everything isn't always perfect.' 

Enjoying a little 'me-time', the evening seemed to be a pleasant one as she indulged in a relaxing face mask while at home, writing 'self-care' over the snap. 

'It's OK to be a bit lost in life': Lottie Moss shared pictures of herself crying on Instagram on Monday after watching a 'lame' film as she says 'everything isn't always perfect'

Glam: She usually posts lots of glam pictures on Instagram but wanted to show more of the real side of her  

Then sobbing, she wrote': I shouldn't watch sad films.' 

She then cried harder and penned: 'It's OK to not be OK sometimes. It's OK to cry at lame films and it's OK to be a bit lost in life.

'Everyone's lives look so amazing on Instagram and I'm here to remind you that everything isn't always perfect.' 

'I shouldn't watch sad films': Dressed in a cosy hoodie, Lottie struggled to keep her emotions in check 

Self care: She had been treating herself to a face mask before her feelings got the better of her 

Lottie had been isolating in the Cotswolds with her family during the lockdown after being unable to fly home to LA but is now staying in London. 

Recently, Lottie fuelled dating speculation when she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during a recent holiday.

In videos and pictures shared to Instagram, Chris, 27, can be seen putting on a cosy display with the blonde, and even proceeds to drape his leg over her.

Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April. 

It came after Lottie was linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury.
