Aldi has recalled on Jack 'N' Jill Wooden Block Sets (Farm, Jungle and Ocean

Aldi has urgently recalled a popular children's toy over fears kids could choke to death. 

The supermarket giant has issued a recall on Jack 'N' Jill Wooden Block Sets (Farm, Jungle and Ocean).

The affected products were sold at ALDI stores in NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, ACT, and WA from June 10 to September 9. 

Small magnets may detach from the blocks and fall off, which poses a risk of choking, suffocation or death for young children.

Consumers should immediately stop using the products and return them to the nearest ALDI store for a full refund. 

'ALDI takes product quality and safety seriously,' the chain said is a statement on Facebook. 

'We apologise for any inconvenience.'
