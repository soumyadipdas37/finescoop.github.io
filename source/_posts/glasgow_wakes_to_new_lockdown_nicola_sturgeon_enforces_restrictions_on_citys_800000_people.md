Glasgow is waking up to new lockdown restrictions today following a spike in coronavirus cases.  

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move after 66 new positive tests were recorded in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area yesterday.

Restrictions on visiting other households now apply to people living in Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire.

Exceptions were given – on top of emergency circumstances or providing care to a vulnerable person – for extended households which were established during lockdown.

This includes people who live alone, couples who do not reside together and parents who live alone with children under 18.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move after 66 new positive tests were recorded in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area yesterday

Under the new rules - which also apply to West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire - residents are no longer allowed to meet up with other households indoors

Indoor visits to hospitals and care homes will be limited to 'essential-only' to protect the most vulnerable



It is expected the measures will be in place for two weeks, however the Scottish Government will review them after one week

Ms Sturgeon said: 'I have just chaired a meeting of the Scottish Government's Resilience Room (SGoRR) which met to discuss the rising number of new Covid-19 cases across Scotland but particularly the rising number of cases in recent days in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.

'Over the past two days, we have seen 314 new cases in Scotland and 135 of these in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.



'If these numbers continue or – and this is the fear – they rise further, then more people will fall ill from Covid-19 and more people will enter hospital and intensive care.'

She added: 'Transmission appears mainly to be happening inside people's homes and between households, rather than in pubs and restaurants.

'Having carefully considered the data and consulted with local public health officials, local authorities and Police Scotland – all of whom were involved in the resilience meeting discussion that has just taken place – I can therefore confirm this evening that we have decided to take the following action.

'From midnight tonight, if you live in local authority areas of East Renfrewshire, the city of Glasgow or West Dunbartonshire you should not host people from other households in your home and you should not visit someone else's home – no matter where that is.'

It is expected the measures will be in place for two weeks, however the Scottish Government will review them after one week.

Meanwhile, indoor visits to hospitals and care homes will be limited to 'essential-only' to protect the most vulnerable.

Outdoor visits to care homes will be permitted for up to three people from a maximum of two households, in line with current guidance.

Schools and nurseries will remain open, and plans for the opening of colleges and universities remain in place.

Ms Sturgeon added: 'I understand this will not be welcome news for people living in Glasgow, East Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire but it is necessary to help us limit the spread of Covid-19.

'Acting now gives us the time and the space to protect people and get more control over the virus.'
