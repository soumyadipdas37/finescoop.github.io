Kim Kardashian is revealing the secrets to wearing the right undergarments.

In new video clips posted to her Instagram Stories on Sunday, the 39-year-old reality star showed fans a new clay-colored underwear ensemble from her SKIMS line, that she claims is great for when you want your body to look 'snatched.'

'I wanted to show you guys my go-to shapewear, when I wear something underneath,' she explained in the video, while posing in her underwear.

She explained: 'I love this shapewear bra, if you don't want to wear an underwear bra, but you need something that snatches you, that is so supportive, then this bra is the best.'

'And the shapewear brief just snatches you and makes you feel really secure, because sometimes you can't wear a thong, especially if you're wearing a sheer something and you need to show like a full bottom,' she continued. 

Meanwhile, it was revealed over the weekend, that Kim's husband Kanye West is keen to purchase another ranch in Wyoming.

The Bound 2 rapper is reportedly interested in purchasing the Double Doc Ranch in Cody, Wyoming after visiting it the other day. 

The ranch, which operates as a horse breeding and training facility, is already home to three horses owned by the Kardashian-West family, TMZ reports. 

Kanye's wife Kim previously revealed he wants to move to Wyoming but her law studies mean they can't just yet.

Telling all: Kim gave fans a little impromptu tutorial on Sunday afternoon

Kim must remain a resident of California so she can sit the state bar exam there in 2024. She said at the time: 'I know that my husband wants to move to Wyoming, but I love California.'

'Honestly, the sky, the air, everything is different in Wyoming. I love it. It's a happy place for me, and my sisters, we all want to get a ranch there. We just did a cattle drive down there. It's been amazing.'

However, she is currently based in Los Angeles.
