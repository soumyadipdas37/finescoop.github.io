'I walked in, did my audition [and] the casting director looked at me and she was like: "That's great. Can you do that again, but this time sound more Latina?" '

America admitted she was confused by the remark and said to the director: 'Um, so do you want me to do this in Spanish?'

She said the director replied: 'And she was like, "No no no ... do it in English, but just, you know, sound more Latina," ' to which she said: 'I am Latina and this is what I sound like.'

America said the casting director then replied: 'Okay, sweetie. Thank you. Bye.' 

She said: 'I walked in, did my audition [and] the casting director looked at me and she was like: "That's great. Can you do that again, but this time sound more Latina?" ' (pictured in 2002)

The actress went home to tell her family about the incident, recalling that they were not surprised by what she told them. 

Her family said: 'They wanted you to speak in broken English. They wanted you to sound like a chola.'

"'What did you think was going to happen? They were going to have you starring in the next role meant for Julia Roberts?" And I was like, "Yeah." That is what I thought.'

She added: 'That realisation for me has fueled me to create more opportunity for little brown girls to fulfill their talent and their dream.'
