Incredible footage has emerged showing the moment brave guards launched into action to save inmates as a ferocious fire ripped through a women's prison. 

The heart-stopping moment happened at Mary Wade Correctional Centre at Lidcombe on June 12.

Officers Andrew Boan, Geoffrey Ronayne and Fraser Leavasa rushed to the cell block to find bright orange flames filling the room. 

Panicked screams could be heard from inside the cell as thick smoke started spreading throughout the building.

Mr Ronayne risked his life to rescue the two trapped inmates while Mr Boan extinguished the flames.

Moments later one inmate ran out of a cell before collapsing in the hallway. 

The footage shows Mr Leavasa performing lifesaving CPR on the collapsed inmate.

Others can be heard pleading for help as one of the officers helps to escort an injured inmate into the courtyard. 

Fire crews can then be seen rushing through cell block clearing the scene.

A makeshift triage centre was set up in the prison yard to treat the 50 inmates and officers affected by the blaze.

Mr Boan told 9 News it was 'human instinct' which prompted him into lifesaving action. 

'We weren't really thinking these are inmates, we were thinking these are two human beings that need to be rescued,' he said.

'The whole cell had gone up - it was like an inferno.' 

The trio were given bravery awards on Wednesday for their efforts.

NSW Corrective Services Commissioner Peter Severin said they put their own lives in harm's way to save two lives and prevent what could have been a significant fire.

It is alleged inmates used aluminum from their lunch trays to ignite the fire.
