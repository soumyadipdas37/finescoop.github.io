Makeup mogul Kylie Jenner is feeling grateful for her fans.

The 23-year-old brunette bombshell has found success yet again at the release of her most recently Kylie Cosmetics launch, the Sailor Collection, which hit the website on August 31.

Though the products have not yet sold out - which is often common by the day after a launch - Kylie took to the Kylie Cosmetics Instagram page to thank her shoppers for their business and encourage people to share their makeup looks.

Adorned in a white top and tiny anchor necklace, the social media maven posed with her face softly rested on her hands as she seductively stared into the camera. 

'Thanks for all the love on the Sailor Collection. I can't wait to see all your looks! xo, Kylie' she captioned the image. 

Kylie adorned her signature plump lips with her new matte lip kit and revealed a blend of her new eyeshadows on her lids.   

A few weeks before the product launch, Kylie teased her astounding 193M followers with snaps from a seductive sailor themed shoot on her Instagram story.

Often in advance of her launches Kylie takes to Instagram to walk her audience through the products as a marketing tactic. 

This direct to consumer strategy is incredibly smart but often deceitful as fans often operate under the pretense that they will look like Kylie if they buy her products. 

Though the stunning mother of one has opened up about her lip fillers in the past, the siren has remained otherwise mum when it comes to any other procedures she may have had. 

Last week Kylie found herself in hot water as she posted a series of snaps from a Paris trip with friends.

Though it was purported that she was there on business with her brand's parent company, Coty, many were outraged about the level of traveling the 'billionaire' has been doing since the pandemic began.

Recently the star had been the recipient of romance rumors that she and Travis Scott are back on again amid their quarantine co-parenting of two-year-old daughter Stormi. 

Since then Kylie has been linked to Madison Beer's ex Zack Bia who she vacationed with on two occasions during quarantine, and was also seen out with rumored ex, rapper PartyNextDoor in West Hollywood a few nights ago.
