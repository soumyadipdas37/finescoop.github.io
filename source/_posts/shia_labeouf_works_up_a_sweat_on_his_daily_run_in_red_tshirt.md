Shia LaBeouf was back and working up a sweat on Wednesday as he went for his daily jog. 

The actor, 34, appeared engrossed in his morning exercise wearing a loose-fitting red T-shirt and navy Nike running leggings. 

With his AirPods in, the Hollywood star listened to music as he worked on his fitness regime.

The eccentric actor is known to be incredibly committed to his film characters.

He tattooed his entire chest for his role as Creeper in the David Ayers film which was released on August 7. 

Meanwhile, Labeouf and Tax Collector director David Ayers recently found themselves in the line of fire after being accused of 'Cholo' cultural appropriation.

After a series of Twitter attacks, the director replied: 'Really important answer - Shia is playing a whiteboy who grew up in the hood. 

'This is a Jewish dude playing a white character. Also the only white dude in the movie.'

Though LaBeouf's role is supposed to be that of a 'whiteboy' who finds himself as a tax collector to a Latino drug lord, internet social justice warriors were quick to write about the casting decision.  

Shia was due to appear at the Fast Times at Ridgemont High virtual benefit for charity on August 21. 

The live table read included a cast of Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman among others. 

Unfortunately the star-studded event had to be rescheduled due to technical difficulties, though no date has been given at this time.
