Lily Allen has sparked engagement speculation once again, after she was spotted sporting a dazzling diamond ring while out in New York City on Tuesday. 

The Smile singer, 35, was seen strolling through the bustling metropolis alongside her actor beau David Harbour, 45, and her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven.

And as the star lowered her protective face mask to sip an iced drink, it was hard to miss the sparkling jewellery item, which was first seen last year, on her ring finger.

London-born Lily stepped out in casually cool style for the relaxed family outing, donning a blue crop top, teamed with cuffed jeans and white running shoes.

With her raven locks styled into an updo, the mother-of-two highlighted her features with a light and natural palette of makeup.

Also amid the selection of images shared were breathtaking scenery shots from their time sailing the welcoming azure waters off the Adriatic Coast.

Captioning the snaps, Lily wrote: 'Bye bye Croatia. We had the best time, will definitely be back. Special shout outs to our amazing crew on Nostra Vita and @goolets for sorting everything out for us so last minute. Trip of a lifetime for sure.'   

Over the past two weeks, the couple had been seen soaking up the sunshine during their break with Lily's daughters, who she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper.

Under new government guidelines, the singer will have to quarantine for 14 days upon her arrival back in the UK due to tightening travel restrictions in COVID-19 hit areas across Europe.

Lily has previously been open about her struggle with alcohol and substance abuse, saying she turned to it when she experienced trouble in her personal life. 

To mark the past 12 months of being tee-total, Lily posted bikini photos alongside one of the star looking noticeably worse-for-wear. Lily captioned the post: '1 year completely sober! So grateful for my health and happiness.'

It is thought Lily gave up drinking around the time she started dating David.

The couple were first spotted at the theatre in London last August and their relationship has gone on from strength-to-strength.

The mother-of-two previously took to Instagram to laud her new healthier lifestyle after she quit drinking. 

She told her fans: '9 months sober today! And the beginning of an ab is appearing. Very pleased!'

Lily revealed she had turned to the bottle when experiencing trouble in her personal life in an interview with Stereogum in 2018.

Singer Lily, who has bi-polar disorder, said: 'I think I'm a raging co-dependent and then when I feel like I can't cope, I abuse alcohol and drugs to plaster over some stuff, but I've never been somebody that craves a fix.'
