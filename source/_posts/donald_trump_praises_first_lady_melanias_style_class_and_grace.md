President Donald Trump has praised his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, for her speech to the Republican National Convention, and defended her from cruel criticism over her English pronunciation, noting it is not her first language. 

'They like her, they love her style, her class, her grace,' Donald Trump said when asked by Fox News host Laura Ingraham about Melania's appeal to female voters in an interview that aired on Tuesday.

'I thought she gave an incredible speech,' Trump added. 'And you have to understand, it's not her first language,' he continued, referencing critics who mocked the first lady over her accent. 

'How many people could come over and make a speech to the world, think of it, no think of it, she did an incredible job,' Trump said.

The president added that his wife will be participating actively in his re-election campaign, saying 'she'll be very much involved, she wants to see this be a victory.'

Melania won praise from some for her compassionate RNC speech last week, in which she told families affected by the coronavirus pandemic 'you’re not alone.'

However, others unleashed shocking criticism of the first lady, a native of Slovenia, over her accented English and ethnic background.

Actress Bette Midler apologized after tweeting that Melania 'can't speak English' and calling the first lady an 'illegal alien.'

Midler admitted she was 'wrong' to mock Melaniain social media posts she shared while watching the Republican National Convention.  

'A UGE bore! She can speak several words in a few languages. Get that illegal alien off the stage!' Middler had written in a tweet.

The First Lady spoke about her migrant background in her RNC speech, telling the audience that 'I was able to achieve my own American dream'.

The Slovenian-born former fashion model moved to the US in the 1990s and was granted American citizenship in 2006. 

'Growing up as a young child in Slovenia, which was under communist rule at the time, I always heard about an amazing place called America - a land that stood for freedom and opportunity,' she said. 

'As I grew older it became my goal to move to the United States and follow my dream of working in the fashion industry.

'My parents worked very hard to ensure our family could not only leave and prosper in America, but also contribute to a nation that allows for people to arrive with a dream and make it reality.' 

In her speech she also called for an end to what she called 'violence and looting' during the months of race protests after the death of George Floyd. 

'Instead of tearing things down, let's reflect on our mistakes. Be proud of our evolution and look to our way forward,' she said. 

'Every day let us remember that we are one nation under God, and we need to cherish one another.'
