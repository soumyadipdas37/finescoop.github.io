She was seen making a low-key arrival in Italy for Milan Fashion Week on Friday.

And Kendall Jenner put on a stylish display as she stepped out in the Italian city for an outing on Sunday morning.

The model, 24, showed off her slender figure in a black gown that had a turtleneck design and a daring thigh-split to show off her legs.

Wow! Kendall Jenner showed off her slender figure in a black turtleneck gown and a cropped cardigan as she stepped out during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday

Kendall added a chic touch to her look by wearing a dark brown cardigan that was cropped high to accentuate her slender waist.

She boosted her height in a pair of thigh-high lace-up boots, and she kept her personal items in a Louis Vuitton handbag.

The TV personality pulled her brunette locks into a messy bun and accessorised with a pair of black shades, while she wore a beige face mask amid the coronavirus crisis.

Earlier in the week, she was seen wearing a crop top and tracksuit bottoms as she arrived in the city alongside her pal and fellow model Hailey Bieber, 23. 

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in Hugo Boss' show on Friday.

Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian.

'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. 

In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  

'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked, prompting Kylie to reply: 'Absolutely.' 

Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. 

The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair colour.

Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image 

The photo appeared to have been taken at a restaurant, where Kim and Khloe sat at the table while their younger sisters posed beside them. 

Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.

Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  

Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling.
