A woman threatened to stab a worker at a KFC in California during a screaming rant during which she jumped onto the restaurant counter after she was allegedly refused service for not wearing a mask.

The Kentucky-fried fiasco shows a maskless woman becoming aggressive with a female employee in the KFC which is believed to be in the Fresno area.

Footage of the incident shows the woman then jumping onto the counter where she yells 'Gimme something to f---ing eat! I'm hungry!'

The woman then launches a largely unintelligible rant at a male employee during which she dares him to call the cops.

The unidentified woman also threatens to stab a female worker unless she gets 'something to eat' immediately.

In another video the woman clarifies her order of mashed potatoes and chicken despite staff telling her that she will not be served.

One employee tells the angry woman: 'I can't. I'll get fired.'

Despite the this staff member obviously working at the KFC the woman yells back at him: 'You don't even work here!'

Shortly after the woman kicks over a promotional sign as she walks up to the counter and climbs onto it, says Fox News. 

At this point she again demands to be told why she cannot get any food. A staff member tells her that it is because she is not wearing a mask.

The woman is abusive to the worker before she appears to threaten him with aggravation when he gets off work.

Largely ignored by the staff the woman gets off the counter and moves towards the door.

She is offered a spare mask by another customer but the woman then declares that 'she doesn't give a s***' anymore and states that the KFC's kitchen is disgusting.

No-one from KFC or Yum! Brands, its parent company, were available for comment on the videos. 

The footage was shared to TikTok and Facebook by a woman who said it took place in Fresno.

This is one of several fast-food meltdowns in recent months with most seeming to be due to customers refusing to wear masks. 

In a Taco Bell, in Bolivar, Missouri, a mask-free woman shouts at customers, uses racial language and claims to be 'Charlie f*****g Manson's daughter,' when she was denied service. 

Similar style outburst have also been reported at McDonald's and Burger King among other places.
