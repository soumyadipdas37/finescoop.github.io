A finance expert has shared the five 'holy grail' makeup products she swears by for a fresh, natural-looking complexion every time.

Canna Campbell, from Sydney, used five items in her 'minimalist' makeup routine to perfect her radiant look in just four-and-a-half minutes - but will last all day long.

'Sharing with you my favourite minimal makeup look. These are the products if I was stuck on a desert island I would take with me and I'd be very happy using these and creating this look for the rest of my life,' she said in her latest YouTube video.

'When I'm going to a special event or filming, I will put a lot more makeup on but if it's something like just an everyday or just weekend, I like to keep it fresh and natural. 'So these are the products which I absolutely love.'

Finance expert Canna Campbell used just five 'holy grail' beauty products for her natural look

She used just five items in her 'minimalist' makeup routine to perfect her radiant look in just four-and-a-half minutes - but will last all day

Giorgio Armani Neo Nude Natural Glow Foundation (shade: 5.5): $68

Fenty Beauty Cream - Butta Biscuit: $50

Westman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick (shade: Petal): $80

Maybelline Great Lash Mascara: $12.95

Lanolips 101 Ointment lip balm: $18.99 

After applying her serum, SPF50 sunscreen and moisturiser, she used a $68 Giorgio Armani 'Neo Nude Glow' foundation as the base.

'It's really important to have a really good base to then build upon to keep it nice and fresh and natural,' she explained.

'Giorgio Armani Neo Nude is incredible. I'm wearing the shade 5.5. It's supposed to be like a tinted moisturiser but I would actually say it's a little bit heavier than a tinted moisturiser but only marginally.

'You only need the teeniest tiniest amount and it goes a long way. It stays on all day, it is so light and dewy and of course if you want a heavier look, you can very easily just layer it up.

'This is unbelievable to the point where I could actually wear this and not need any other foundation. For me it just ticks so many boxes and it's not as heavy as a foundation. It's so light but it gives me that little bit more coverage than a tinted moisturiser would.'

Canna said her second favourite product is the $50 Fenty Beauty cream bronzer in the 'Butta Biscuit' shade. 

'I use it as a contour so I just dab it... I use the natural light to help me work out the contours... Dabble and blend around the hairline so it gives me a slightly bronze look without looking artificially tanned because I am quite fair skinned,' she said.

Next, she used the $80 Westman Atelier 'baby cheeks' blush stick.

'This is beautiful,' Canna said. 

'If you're a minimalist and you don't want too much makeup, this is a great investment. You can use it on your lips, you can blush and eye shadow. Really natural.'

Canna pointed out the three-month rule that applies to mascara so she never wants to be a fortune on the product. 

Beauty experts have said old products should be discarded after three months as there could be germs in the tube, putting you at risk of an eye infection.

She said her go-to products Giorgio Armani foundation, blush stick and Maybelline mascara

Canna said her go-to item is the classic $12.95 Maybelline Great Lash Mascara.

'Mascara lasts three months so I have an issue with paying too much for a really expensive mascara. But this is great because it's cheap, it's really good, it's a cult product... this goes back to the 80s,' she said.

To finish off her look, Canna applies the $18.99 Lanolips lip balm. 

'There's nothing that annoys me more than the sensation of having dry lips. I hate it,' she said. 

Canna added: 'So this is my fresh, clean, minimal makeup look. Something I would gravitate towards most days and it's so quick and easy to apply.

'I've used five products all of which neatly and tidily fit into a very organised, efficient makeup pouch of mine. Five products - a fresh, everyday, minimal makeup look.'
