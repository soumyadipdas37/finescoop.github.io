Her acting career never quite reached the heady heights of Hollywood, but Amanda Holden managed to pull off an impressive Sharon Stone impression on Wednesday. 

The presenter emulated Stone's notorious interrogation scene from 1992 thriller Basic Instinct in a selfie shared with her 1.5 million Instagram followers.

Fortunately mother-of-two Holden, 49, revealed significantly less than the actress's no-holds-barred character Catherine Tramell while striking a coquettish pose at London's Global Radio Studios.

Not bad: Her acting career never quite reached the heady heights of Hollywood, but Amanda Holden managed to pull off an impressive Sharon Stone impression on Wednesday 

Holden originally caught the eye earlier that morning after making her way towards the Leicester Square studio in an elegant black wrap dress with a belted waist. 

Amanda's breezy outfit ensured she commanded attention, and the presenter responded with a characteristically cheerful smile as she made her way inside. 

She added to her look with a pair of highly distinctive backless heels, while a black leather handbag and heavily tinted sunglasses rounded things off.

'Thank you to all the staff for looking after us so well... NOT an #ad ( thanks to John on the door for humouring me by taking this pic early this morning)'

Cliveden house is a popular spot for celebs and has hosted an array of famous faces over the years including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charlie Chaplin.

The property, once owned by William Waldorf Astor, was also the hotel where Meghan Markle stayed the night before her wedding to Price Harry in 2018.
