Locky Gilbert has incurred the wrath of former Bachelorette Angie Kent for 'liking' photos of bikini-clad reality stars on Instagram.

This week, the So Dramatic podcast busted Locky double-tapping racy photos of Love Island Australia's Jessie Wynter and Francoise Draschler, and Bachelor babe Elly Miles back in April. 

Responding to a compilation of screenshots showing Locky's likes, Angie wrote: 'I find it super disrespectful when dudes who have girlfriends go on cute little liking sprees of babes in bathers or lingerie.'

She continued: 'I mean sure, have a good old look and appreciate the magic that is the female chass, you’re only human.... but unless home girl is your girlfriend or ya best friend, how about you don’t go and double tap that? It’s not that hard.

'Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. Their big male egos would throw toys so far out of their prams... we’d never hear the god damn end of it,' she finished.

Locky's ex-girlfriend, former Love Island Australia star Jordan Cayless, responded to Angie's rant, writing: 'Couldn't of said it better myself!'

Additionally, the Bachie Funny Instagram account uncovered a TikTok video of a mystery brunette claiming that she was previously chatting to Locky on Instagram.

However, it's unclear when exactly the pair were talking and what the nature of their relationship was.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.  

Angie has been outspoken about The Bachelor franchise in recent months.

The reality star recently admitted that she was shocked to see Ciarran Stott and Timm Hanly's behaviour on the most recent season of Bachelor In Paradise.

'I don't know him. Timm was completely different to the person I fell for on [The Bachelorette],' Angie told The Kyle and Jackie O Show last week. 

'The Timm on Bachelor In Paradise was extremely different to the Timm I was seeing in the Bachelorette mansion,' she added.

Angie admitted she was also shocked to see how differently Ciarran Stott behaved on Bachelor In Paradise following his sweet-natured performance on The Bachelorette.

Ciarran established himself as the main 'villain' on Bachelor In Paradise thanks to his womanising behaviour.

Speculating on why Timm and Ciarran behaved so differently during his second appearance on screens, Angie said she believes it came down to 'the environment' and the male ego.

'[Timm and Ciarran had] just finished The Bachelorette, they've got their fifteen minutes, egos are huge, they're back with the boys,' Angie said, adding that being surrounded by a bevy of attractive women in Fiji also exacerbated the situation.

'I was like, "cool, this is what you're like when you're not locked down in The Bachelor",' she finished.
