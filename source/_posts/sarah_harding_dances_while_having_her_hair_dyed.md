The Girls Aloud singer, 38, posted a video of herself with foils in her hair while dancing to Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground on Saturday. 

Sarah shared her shocking diagnosis with fans on Instagram in August leading to an outpouring of support from an array of stars including her former bandmates.

She wrote: 'Hi everyone, I hope you are all keeping safe and well during these uncertain times. 

'I've not posted on here for so long, thank you to everyone who has reached out to check in on me, it really does mean a lot. 

'I feel now is the right time to share what's been going on. There's no easy way to say this and actually it doesn't even feel real writing this, but here goes.

'Earlier this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a couple of weeks ago I received the devastating news that the cancer has advanced to other parts of my body.'

Sarah continued: 'I'm currently undergoing weekly chemotherapy sessions and I am fighting as hard as I possibly can. I understand this might be shocking to read on social media and that really isn't my intention. 

'But last week it was mentioned online that I had been seen in hospital, so I feel now is the time to let people know what's going on and this is the best way I can think of to do so. 

'My amazing mum, family and close friends are helping me through this, and I want to say a thank you to the wonderful NHS doctors and nurses who have been and continue to be heroes. 

'I am doing my very best to keep positive and will keep you updated here with how I'm getting on. In the meantime I hope you'll all understand and respect my request for privacy during this difficult time. Sending you all so much love….xx.'

Moving: Sarah's bandmates Cheryl, Nicola, Kimberley Walsh and Nadine all shared their support for the star on Twitter following her shocking news







 





Supportive: She received an outpouring of support from stars on Instagram, including former bandmate Nadine Coyle 

After Sarah announced her diagnosis, pop stars Cheryl, Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle - who enjoyed more than decade of chart-topping success with Sarah in Girls Aloud - reached out to their former bandmate.

It came after Sarah disappeared from the public eye two years ago after achieving notoriety through her wild antics, explosive love affairs and a rehab stint in 2011. 

Posting on Twitter, Cheryl, 37, shared a single broken heart emoji, while Nadine, 35, insisted she will continue to support her old friend during the crisis. 

She wrote: 'I love you!! You have always been able to achieve miracles when needed!! I am here for the all ways & always will be!!!'

Kind: In her post, Sarah credited her 'amazing' mum Marie, her close friends and NHS staff with supporting her through her health battle (pictured in 2017) 

Clearly shocked by Sarah's diagnosis, Nicola tweeted: 'It goes without saying that this is blindsiding. @SarahNHarding you’re so loved and supported.'

Kimberley, 38, also sent her love to her former bandmate, writing: 'My heart is broken. You are so strong and brave and we are with you every step of the way.'

Girls Aloud - formed of Sarah, Cheryl, Nadine, Nicola and Kimberley - split in 2013, but were dogged by rumours of secret feuds within the band, with Cheryl, Nicola and Kimberley forming a notably closer bond.  

Sarah's post also sparked an outpouring of support messages from stars, including Steps' Ian 'H' Watkins who wrote: 'Sending HUGE ❤️❤️❤️ Stay Strong xx We're all behind you xx.'

TOWIE's Jess Wright also responded with a flurry of heart emojis, while singer Michelle Gayle wrote: 'Love you honey. xxx'

Bob Geldof's daughter Fifi wrote: 'Oh my angel... I'm so sorry to hear this awful news!!! Fight hard and look after yourself - please shout if I can help at all. Much love to you.'

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated?

What is breast cancer?

Breast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts.

When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an 'invasive' breast cancer. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.

Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare.

Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.

The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing. High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.

What causes breast cancer?

A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'.

Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics.

What are the symptoms of breast cancer?

The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign. 

The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.

How is breast cancer diagnosed?

If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray.



How is breast cancer treated?

Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.

How successful is treatment?

The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.

The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.
