Tarek El Moussa and his fiancée Heather Rae Young made another big commitment to each other by buying their first house together in Newport Beach, California.

But the 39-year-old Flip Or Flop star and the 33-year-old Selling Sunset fixture still have a lot of work to do on the home, which will need to be totally updated and restored.

That because Tarek originally bought the home with the intention of flipping it, only to decide it had the potential to be their dream home, according to People.

'Tarek originally bought it as a flip but then they decided to make it their new home,' a representative for the couple said.

On Tuesday, Tarek shared video to his Instagram Stories of him and Heather touring the new house, which the two plan to give a full makeover before moving in.

'It’s their first project together!' their rep continued. 'They have a lot they want to do with it and the house needs some work so they are going to continue to live in their current home until the new home is ready.'

In his Insta Stories, Tarek said the couple are already meeting with a designer to decide how to proceed with the new property.

'This is basically the blank slate,' Heather says of the bare home and its all-white kitchen.

The home has a spacious open floor plan, and just off the kitchen are the living room and dining room, along with a staircase up to the second floor.

The couple head upstairs to the open roof top, which features gorgeous views of the area and would be perfect for a barbecue or get-together.

Tarek calls the open space 'why we fell in love with this house' in his video. 'This is why we love this house: the ocean is right there,' he continues.

Although Tarek and Heather didn't seem fazed by it, the sky was filled with a grayish haze from wildfires raging near Los Angeles to the north.

Throughout the videos, Heather points out things they're already planning to change, like one fire pit that will be removed and another that will be updated, as well as a spot where they plan to install a hot tub.

The couple will have prime access to the hot tub thanks to a door going from their master bedroom upstairs to the balcony.

While Tarek and Heather work on fixing up their new home, they'll continue to live in their rented house, also located nearby in Newport Beach.

They've been living their together since the HGTV star sold off the home he bought with the intention of living with his children following his divorce from his Flip Or Flop costar Christina Anstead.

Heather and Tarek met on July 4, 2019, after mutual friends introduced them in Newport Beach, and they got engaged on July 25 this year.

Christina, who previously went by Tarek's last name, separated from Tarek in May 2016 following an incident with Tarek in which he had a gun and police had to be called.

The two filed for divorce in 2017 and it was finalized by early 2018.

Despite the divorce, the two have remained committed co-parents, and they continue to star on Flip Or Flop together.

In late 2017, Christina began dating English TV presenter Ant Anstead, and the couple were married in December 2018. 

On September 6, 2019, the new couple welcomed their first child together, Hudson London Anstead.
