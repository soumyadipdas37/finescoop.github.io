Jennifer Garner has been getting in plenty of family time, while quarantining with her three children, daughters Violet, 14 and Seraphina, 11, and son Samuel, eight.

But the 48-year-old actress took some time away from her brood on Monday afternoon to hit up a luxury spa in her Brentwood neighborhood.

Garner kept the majority of her famous mug concealed behind a floral print face mask and a pair of chic square sunglasses.

Her brunette hair was styled into a half up, half down hairdo and she had a pink bracelet and an Apple Watch fastened around her wrist.

The 13 Going On 30 star kept casual for her spa day in a plain grey tee and a pair of denim boyfriend jeans.

She slipped her feet into a pair of white sneakers that featured accents of powder blue and light pink through out.

Jennifer carried her cellphone in her hand and she kept the rest of her belongings in a large canvas bag that she had tucked under her arm. 

She was forced to walk through the spa's parking garage in order to reach its entrance.

After getting pampered, the actress headed home to her three children, whom she shares with ex Ben Affleck, 47.

Jennifer and Ben were married from 2005 until their divorce in 2018.

Affleck has been spending the majority of his time in lockdown with his girlfriend and Deep Water co-star Ana de Armas, 32. 

Though Garner spends most of her time focusing on her kids, the Alias star has also been indulging in some hangout sessions recently with actor pal Bradley Cooper, 45.

Garner's outing on Monday comes just three-days after the tragic passing of fellow actor Chadwick Boseman.

She happened to act alongside Boseman in their 2014 film Draft Day, which also starred Kevin Costner.

Boseman, who also famously played the title character in Marvel's Black Panther, died at his home in Los Angeles on Friday after enduring a four-year battle with colon cancer.

The actor, who was just 43 at the time of his death, never spoke publicly about his diagnosis, which progressed from stage three to stage four over the course of his battle.  

After learning of his death, Jennifer took to Instagram to pen a touching tribute and share a gorgeous portrait of the late actor.

'Loss after loss in 2020, but this one is specifically painful. An artist, a scholar, a gentleman. May your memory be a blessing, Chadwick,' wrote the actress in her post's caption.
