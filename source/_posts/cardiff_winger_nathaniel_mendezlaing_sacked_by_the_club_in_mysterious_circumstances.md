Cardiff City have dramatically sacked star winger Nathanial Mendez-Laing. 

The Championship club revealed on Wednesday afternoon that the player's contract had been terminated with immediate effect but the reason for his dismissal is yet to be disclosed. 

A club statement read: 'Cardiff City Football Club has, with immediate effect, terminated the contract of Nathaniel Mendez-Laing.



'The club will not be making any further comment on the matter.'

The player deleted all of his social media channels as speculation gathered pace as to the reason behind his breach of contract, which in turn led to his sacking. 

Manager Neil Harris had revealed previously that the player was not involved in pre-season because of 'personal reasons'.
