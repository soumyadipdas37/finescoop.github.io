The wife of Donald Trump's demoted campaign boss Brad Parscale fled screaming into the street in just her bikini - before telling a passerby: 'I think my husband just killed himself'.

Police raced to Parscale's Fort Lauderdale, Florida home Sunday afternoon after the Good Samaritan bundled Candice Parscale into her car and dialed 911.

As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after her 44-year-old husband began 'ranting and raving'.

Candice, 41, then buried her head in the stranger's lap and sobbed uncontrollably until officers revealed he was still alive and asked for his cell number so they could begin negotiations.

The witness, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told DailyMail.com she also noticed evidence of bruising on Candice's upper arms.

Police dispatch records reveal marksmen could see into the $2.4 million property where Parscale was sat shirtless on the floor with his dog, drinking beer and 'talking to himself'.

The chaotic scene ended without tragedy about an hour and a half later when he agreed to surrender and was involuntarily committed to a hospital by Fort Lauderdale police.

Well-placed sources told DailyMail.com Parscale is under investigation for the theft of campaign funds. 

A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home, including two rifles, two shotguns, five handguns and a small revolver. 

The witness, who just happened to be passing by the swank home, said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I noticed this woman coming towards me with virtually nothing on, just her bathing suit.

'She knocked on the window and says, I think my husband just killed himself. I said, Oh my God. Oh my God, come get in my car and I hung up on my friend and dialed 911.

'She was hysterical, she was hyperventilating, she nearly collapsed but I caught her and pulled her into the vehicle. She had her head in my lap and she was just sobbing. I was just trying to keep her calm.

'When she was in the car and we were on hold, I saw both her arms had bruises. She is just a tiny thing. She seemed so sweet and distraught.'

As the two women huddled in the vehicle, cops surrounded the property, stationing marksmen with shields in front of the driveway while approaching from the rear on boats.

A video obtained by DailyMail.com reveals Candice, by now wrapped in a white towel, peering over a line of police cars as officers call up her husband's cell and negotiate his surrender.

'The police presence was huge, they were being extra protective in case he started shooting. Once he answered the phone they knew he was alive,' the Good Samaritan said.

'I didn't see him come out of the house because they made everyone stand so far back. But it was over quickly, maybe an hour and a half to two hours. The police were very calm, very professional.

'The wife was sat on a gurney for a while and she seemed to calm down. There had clearly been some stress for a while and she just seemed relieved it was over. Her husband has got a lot going on, he's a mess.'

Trump and Parscale's relationship had been increasingly strained before his demotion, with the president annoyed by the publicity Parscale had garnered.

But the final straw appeared to be a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally that drew an unexpectedly low crowd of about 6,200 people after Parscale had bragged that more than a million people had requested tickets.

The president was said to be furious. 

Parscale, a political novice, ran Trump's digital advertising in 2016 and was credited with helping bring about his surprise victory that year.

His replacement, Stepien, has been in politics for years, working for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and serving as Trump's national field director in 2016.

The ousted Trump 2020 campaign manager retreated to his waterfront Florida home after being ditched, where he and his wife hosted friends for poolside drinks.
