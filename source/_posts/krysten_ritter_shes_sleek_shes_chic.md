It was a busy day of playing dress up for Krysten Ritter yesterday as the Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 actress hit the streets of New York City in one, two … and then three different outfits. 

The 31-year-old was a fashion watcher’s dream as she continued to enter then exit her downtown hotel in varied outfits, accessories and hairstyles. 

Variety is the spice of life: Krysten Ritter changed outfits, accessories and looks three times in a single day 

The day’s fashion show began with the raven-haired model arriving to her hotel room in a brown leopard-print sun dress with black mid-calf boots. 

Her long hair breezed down her shoulders as she pulled her purple luggage with one hand and sipped up the last of an iced drink with the other. 

Shortly later, she emerged with a sleek and chic new look. 

Is that how she stays so slim? Krysten Ritter sips on an iceddrink

Channeling the late Audrey Hepburn, Ritter had pulled her hair into a fashionable bun atop her head, which accented her stylish bangs. 

A tight black skirt, a gray halter top and gorgeous red pumps completed the gorgeous look. 

This was the outfit Ritter chose to go shopping in, hitting up some local boutiques and jewellery stores. An assistant helped her back to the hotel with her bags. 

Porcelain skin: Ritter, who avoids the sun, showed off her creamy white skin in this elegant yet revealing get-up 

With the sun ready to set over the skyscrapers of New York, Ritter emerged in her third, but final outfit of the day.

The Breaking Bad glamour gal had changed into a stunning blue tie-dyed dress, sleeveless but snug at the top with a loose and flowing hem that came to her ankles. 

Ritter carried a smart green and blue clutch as she waited outside for a companion to whisk her off for dinner at a sushi restaurant. 

The only question is: What will she wear tomorrow?
