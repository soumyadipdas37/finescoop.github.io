Ryan wrote: 'Meet the incredible icon-packed cast of Netflix's THE PROM. A group of true troopers who buckled up and finished shooting during COVID so we could give everybody an inspirational aspirational story that we all need right now.'

He continued: 'Christmas is right around the corner...' 

Meryl rocked red locks in the snap, along with matching lipstick and jacket as she posed alongside Ryan.

Nicole sat on the other side of Ryan wearing a green blazer and matching leggings, adding a black top and hat. 

Kerry beamed in a cream colored look with her hands crossed across her chest. 

The Prom, directed by Ryan, is about a troupe of 'self-obsessed' theater stars that arrive to a small town in Indiana to support a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to prom.
