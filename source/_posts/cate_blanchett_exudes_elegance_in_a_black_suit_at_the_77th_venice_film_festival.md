She is currently acting as the Jury President for the 77th annual Venice Film Festival.

And Cate Blanchett looked stylish as she was seen leaving her hotel to enjoy another day at the event in the Italian city on Monday.

The Thor: Ragnarok star, 51, put on an androgynous chic display during her outing as she donned a black co-ord suit that was embellished with silver and gold beads.

Cate completed her look by teaming the suit with a simple black button-up shirt, while she complemented her ensemble by wearing an array of gold bracelets.

Her golden locks were styled into a sleek bob, and she shielded her eyes with pair of chic shades and protected herself amid the coronavirus crisis by wearing a mask.

Cate's outing comes after she revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'. 

Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor. 

'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'

Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she added of her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.' 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It starts on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.
