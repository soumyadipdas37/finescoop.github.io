LOCKDOWN POUNDS LOST

I gained weight in lockdown, so I've cut out breakfast. I'm meant to have given up dairy and bread, too. After six weeks I have lost four kilograms, so am back to my pre-corona weight.

VIRTUAL WORKOUTS

Usually, I love to go swimming. Instead, at the moment I do a four-mile walk to work and back. 

At the weekend I video-call my friends on WhatsApp while we all do the same YouTube workout, called Miracle Mile, with Leslie Sansone. 

We've made exercise a social thing instead of drinking wine!

HIGH-TECH LIP BALM

My lips have got dry, so I invested in a more hi-tech lip balm, called iS Clinical Youth Lip Elixir (£52, skincity.co.uk). 

It contains cocoa butter, antioxidants and hyaluronic acid, so it's super moisturising, with a plumping effect. I wear it every day under my Mac lipstick.

NATURAL GLOW CHEAT

I've been having Botox twice a year, since I was 42, to soften my fine lines. I'm a great believer in facials. 

Once a month I get a HydraFacial (£150), which removes impurities from city pollution and helps to accelerate cell turnover. 

My skin glows afterwards. Then, in between, I do sheet masks at home. I love the AQ Skin Solutions Intensive Moisturising Repair Mask (£25, facethefuture.co.uk).

DIMINISH DARK CIRCLES

I've always struggled with dark circles under my eyes, but Skin Better Science InterFuse Treatment Cream (£110, perfecteyesltd.com) has made a big difference. 

It contains caffeine, vitamin C and peptides, which help to hydrate delicate skin and de-puff under eyes. 

Their AlphaRet Overnight Cream (£110), containing retinol, is also great for combating pigmentation if you have dry, sensitive skin. 

Retinol is usually drying, but this is an intensively moisturising formula.
