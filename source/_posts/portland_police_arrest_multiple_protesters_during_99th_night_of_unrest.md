Multiple protesters were arrested in Portland overnight after police declared an unlawful assembly during the 99th consecutive night of unrest in the city.

Chaos erupted outside the Portland Police Association building where a few hundred demonstrators gathered after marching from Kenton Park earlier Friday evening. 

Crowds arrived at N Lombard Street to find cops in riot gear as well as Oregon state troopers waiting outside. 

It marks the first time state police officers were back on the front lines after being withdrawn from the area early last month. 

Police warned protesters to stay off the streets and private property, threatening them with citations, arrest, the use of tear gas and crowd-control agents.

The encounter led to a face off with officers, with protesters chanting and tossing balloons, Oregon Live reported.

Just before midnight, about two hours after demonstrators arrived, cops declared an unlawful assembly and began moving in on crowds, pushing people out of the area.

Clouds of smoke filled the air as cops deployed smoke bombs and stun grenades to disperse crowds.

Police ran down the street, knocking people down and arresting those who they say were not following orders. 

As some people were being detained, they were pinned to the ground and blood could be seen marking the street pavement.

At least six people were seen being detained during the clash, according to Oregon Live.  

In a statement to Reuters, police confirmed they made 'multiple arrests tonight' but did not give a specific number.

'Officers will continue to make targeted arrests of those who fail to adhere to this order. The gathering at N Lombard St and N Campbell Ave has been declared an unlawful assembly', police said.   

Demonstrations in Portland, which started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, are reaching 100 straight nights of protests that have been marked by vandalism and violence.

These have at times turned into clashes between demonstrators and officers, as well as between right- and left-wing groups.

The slaying of a right-wing Trump supporter, Aaron 'Jay' Danielson, shot and killed after he came downtown last weekend with a pro-Trump caravan of pickup trucks further roiled things in the liberal city. 

The prime suspect in the shooting, self-described anti-fascist Michael Forest Reinoehl, was killed Thursday night by law enforcement.

Since Floyd's killing, nights of unrest that increasingly targeted a federal courthouse prompted President Donald Trump to dispatch U.S. agents to guard the building in July.

His Democratic challenger in the November 3 presidential election, Joe Biden, has accused Trump of stoking violence with his rhetoric.
