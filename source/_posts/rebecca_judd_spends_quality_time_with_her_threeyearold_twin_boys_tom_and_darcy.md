Lockdown measures just got extended in Melbourne. 

But WAG Rebecca Judd appears to be making the best of a bad situation as she enjoyed quality time with her kids on Tuesday. 

Taking to Instagram, the 37-year-old athletics wear designer showed herself doing creative activities with her twin boys, Tom and Darcy, three.

Tom let his famous mother know he was making a Bart Simpson-inspired puppet. 

Meanwhile, Darcy looked to be equally creative at the dining table. 

It comes after Bec wished her husband of 10 years, Chris Judd, a happy Father's Day on Sunday.
