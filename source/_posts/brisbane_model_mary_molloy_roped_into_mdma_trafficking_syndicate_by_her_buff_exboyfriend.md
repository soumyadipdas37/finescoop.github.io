A glamorous fitness model was roped into an elaborate drug trafficking syndicate by her muscle-bound ex-boyfriend, a court has heard. 

Mary Molloy was handed a three-year suspended sentence in April for her role in Jason Atkins' MDMA operation, which ran across Brisbane between 2016 and 2018. 

Fresh details of Molloy's involvement can be revealed after Atkins was sentenced to seven years jail at Brisbane Supreme Court on Thursday.

At the height of his powers, Atkins was making bank transactions of up to $200,000 while trafficking party drugs across the Queensland capital, the court was told, according to news.com.au.  

But when a stockpile of pills was seized by police from a house in Brisbane in 2017, his supplies dried up - and so too did his cash flow. 

Atkins enlisted his then-Instagram-famous girlfriend to help him recover drug money owed to him.  

He was worried he would not be able to meet his own debts and would face repercussions, the court heard on Thursday. 

'This resulted in him liquidating various assets, including a significantly valuable engagement ring that was in the possession of his partner,' crown prosecutor Michael Gawrych told the court. 

'He engaged her in assisting him in the trafficking business where she chased debts owed.' 

The pair - who had broken up before their arrests - were separately taken into custody in April 2018.

A year later Molloy pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including supplying and trafficking dangerous drugs and failing to properly dispose of a needle.  

Atkins pleaded guilty in March to trafficking drugs.

He was handed a seven-year sentence on Thursday, but will be eligible for parole in two years, with Justice Helen Bowskill taking into account his mental health and personal circumstances.

Defence lawyer Arjun Chhabra told the court Atkins was not a 'kingpin' in the Brisbane drug trade and had a difficult upbringing.

Atkins had struggled through bullying and a difficult home life, which caused him to develop depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts, the court was told.

Mr Chhabra told the court Atkins had attempted suicide twice before he was arrested in 2018 and was seeking treatment for his issues.

Justice Bowskill said the seven-year sentence was to send a 'message of deterrence' to the community.

'I cringe when I hear the word "party drug" being used. It might seem fun at some point in people’s lives but we see day in, day out in this court the misery and destruction being caused by drugs like these,' Justice Bowskill said.
