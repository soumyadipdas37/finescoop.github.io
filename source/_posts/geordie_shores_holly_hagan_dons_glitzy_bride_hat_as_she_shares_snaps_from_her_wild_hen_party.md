She announced her engagement to footballer beau Jacob Blyth in June last year.

And Holly Hagan looked every inch the bride-to-be in a white jumpsuit as she shared snaps from her recent hen do on Friday.

The Geordie Shore star, 28, flaunted her curves in the sheer number and donned a glitzy 'bride' hat at the wild celebration.

She put on a glamorous display in the crystal-adorned head-gear as she posed up a storm for the social media pictures.

Holly wore her honey tresses styled into loose curls and opted for a typically dramatic makeup look.  

Sharing the festivities on Instagram on Thursday, Holly partied with former cast members Marnie Simpson and Nathan Henry, who dressed up as her 'through the ages'.

Her close friend Nathan, 29, documented the event as he said: 'We are at Holly's hen party, and the theme party is Holly through the ages.'  

The reality star channelled the bride during her 'Gothic' phase between 2015 until 2017, while media personality Marnie, 28, honoured her love for unicorns by opting for a whimsical costume.   

The woman of the hour and her nearest and dearest let their hair down as they boogied to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's hit single WAP.

Another gal pal looked busty in a puffy black dress and a fiery red wig, similar to the influencer's appearance at the start of her time on the MTV show. 

Following in the footsteps of Nathan, Holly tried her hand at twerking to music played by their own DJ.

The duo later relished in a spot of karaoke as they belted the lyrics to Jennifer Hudson's 2008 track Spotlight.

Last May, Holly gushed about her three-year relationship with the sportsman in an interview with MailOnline.

The blonde beauty enthused: 'I've never been in a relationship with someone who has loved me back. It's the first time I've ever felt that.' 

Their romance has gone from strength-to-strength as she packed up and left her Teesside home to start her new life in Manchester last year.

Hinting at an engagement just weeks before the sweet moment took place, Holly added: 'I'm hoping for a ring, anytime now would be great. I'm just waiting for it.'

The TV star faced crippling anxiety two years ago when her toxic relationship with former co-star Kyle Christie came to an end. 

At the height of her mental health battle, she suffered from panic attacks, lost her confidence and self esteem - with the thought of even going to the supermarket being too much to handle.

'So when I got with Jacob I realised when you're with the right person, it's so easy you don't have to fight at all. It's the most natural thing in the world.

'I don't regret the relationship with Kyle because it taught me so much, I learned everything I know from that relationship. It only made me a stronger person.' 

Before her three-year romance with Kyle, 27, broke down in March 2017, Holly briefly dated fellow reality star James Tindale and X Factor star Frankie Cocozza in 2011.
