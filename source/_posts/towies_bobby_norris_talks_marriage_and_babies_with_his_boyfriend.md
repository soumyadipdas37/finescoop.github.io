They have been together for nearly a year. 

And things look to be getting very serious with Bobby Norris, 34, and his boyfriend Matt as they are seen to chat about having babies on Wednesday's TOWIE. 

During a swanky date in a skyscraper bar, the loved-up duo enjoy a frank conversation, during which Matt admits a family is something he's 'always wanted'.

Bobby opened the chat by saying: 'We're together for over a year now, which is incredible. Where is your head in terms of being a parent, getting married - is that something you see yourself doing?'

Matt then responded: '100%. Always have done, since I was little. I've always known that I've always wanted a family life. And I think, when the time's right, and when you're ready in every aspect to make that step, 100%. We'll go for it.' 

Aside from the happy family news, in April, Bobby decided to take a brief break from social media after facing homophobic abuse online.

The influencer admitted he signed off the platform after receiving both death and acid attack threats for being gay.

Speaking on FUBAR Radio, the media personality also touched on the impact of the Be Kind campaign as he claimed people have 'gone back to trolling' just months after Love Island host Caroline Flack's death.  

Gemma Collins BFF explained: 'It's so disappointing that something that's been set up to be a positive place gets tarnished with trolls that clearly get something out of it.

'There is that double edged kind of side to it where you don't really want to address it and give them the platform. But also… it's almost weird not to.'

'It's absolutely awful and vile. To the point where from the Saturday night to kind of like Monday morning I thought, 'I'm gonna take a break from social media, this is so full on''. 

While Bobby says he's got 'a thick skin', he shared his worries about others who aren't as mentally strong.

He said: 'I'm so aware there's many people out there that can't, who are affected by it so badly that it affects their mental health and they self-harm and it's awful that some people even take their own lives over it.'
