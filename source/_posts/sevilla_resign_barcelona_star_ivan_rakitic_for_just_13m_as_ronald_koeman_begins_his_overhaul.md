Barcelona have announced the departure of midfielder Ivan Rakitic to former club Sevilla for just £1.3million.

The 32-year-old had been earmarked as a player that could be moved on this summer in the wake of the club's 8-2 mauling by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals. 

He has linked up with the Andalusian side, who he left to join Barca for £18m in 2014. The deal could rise to £8m with bonuses. 

'FC Barcelona publicly expresses its gratitude to Rakitic for his commitment and dedication and wishes him good luck and success in the future,' the club said in a statement.
