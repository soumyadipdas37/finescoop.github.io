Barcelona's pursuit of Memphis Depay appears to have hit a major stumbling block after Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas claimed the club can't make an offer due to their finances being crippled by the coronavirus crisis.

The Spanish giants have been in pursuit of the Lyon winger this summer as they look to bolster their attacking line - with new boss Ronald Koeman hoping to reunite with Depay after coaching him with Holland.

However, Lyon's president has poured cold water over Barcelona's £28million move after claiming that Josep Bartomeu called him to say that they can't make an offer for Depay due to the financial fall-out from the coronavirus crisis.

Responding to an article over the pursuit of Depay, Aulas wrote on Twitter: 'The president of Barca told me on Sunday that Barca was suffering a lot from the Covid crisis and had no possibility of making an offer.'

Aulas' words have put Depay into limbo this summer, with Manchester United reportedly having no intention of using their buy-back option on the 26-year-old.

According to talkSPORT, United have no interest in pursuing a move for Depay after he endured a horrid two seasons at Old Trafford between 2015-2017.

United had buy-back and sell-on clauses included in the deal when Depay joined the French side for around £17m.

Depay has caught the attention of Barcelona thanks to his fine form in recent times for Ligue 1 outfit Lyon.

Since joining Lyon, Depay has shown much more maturity and has improved from his days at Old Trafford, scoring 57 goals in 140 appearances.

Depay made a fantastic start to the new season for Lyon scoring a hat-trick in their opening day 4-1 victory over Dijon while also netting in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat against Montpellier.

If Barcelona want to get their man, they will have to raise vital funds in the transfer market before it closes - with the likes of Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal on the brink of leaving.
