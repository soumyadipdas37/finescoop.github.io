Actress and comedian Nikki Osborne is relocating her family to Queensland amid Melbourne's poor 'quality of life'.

The 39-year-old I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! star will arrive in Brisbane on Monday with husband Jamie Starr and their children, after receiving a border pass.

In an interview with The Courier Mail on Saturday, the mother-of-two described life in Victoria under stage four restrictions as 'depressing'.

Nikki, who was raised in Queensland and has lived in Victoria for 15 years, had her national comedy tour cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.  

'It's really depressing down here. All our friends' businesses are going bust and all my industry mates can't work... it's depressing watching your kids staring at a screen or a wall,' she told the publication.    

Nikki and her family will spend two weeks in mandatory hotel quarantine, and from there she hopes to secure work on productions in Queensland.  

Victoria just announced a record 59 new coronavirus deaths - its highest daily total during the pandemic - but the number of new cases is falling.

Health bosses recorded 87 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, a marked drop compared to the 113 reported on Thursday.  

The latest figures come as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks.

While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked road map is 'out of date', Premier Daniel Andrews refused on Thursday to rule out continuing stage four restrictions.

'Everything is on the table,' Andrews said. 'It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.'

Fifty of the deaths announced on Friday were people who had passed away in aged care in July and August, after a federal and state government review of previous deaths in facilities across the state. 

According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date stage four comes to an end.  

Single people and single parents will also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.

According to the report, which was obtained by the Herald Sun, there are bigger changes coming from September 28, including the curfew being lifted and increased social gatherings.

But the Victorian Chamber of Commerce has denied there is a plan to extend stage four lockdown by two weeks - claiming it is out of date.
