Dancing With The Stars is just 10 days from the premiere of season 29 on September 14th.

So the celebrities and professional dancers were ready to give their all as they made their way to the LA rehearsal studio on Friday.

Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause, 39, lead the pack, looking lean as she arrived to practice wearing a mesh top and shiny, ribbed leggings.

The Netflix reality personality had her hair raked back into a high ponytail and carried a little, black handbag.

Chrishell's rumored dance partner Artem Chinvintsev, 38, arrived around the same time. 

The fiance of Nikki Bella was still in his street clothes, clad in jeans and a flannel unbuttoned to reveal his pecs.

Kaitlyn Bristowe, 35, flaunted her flat abs in an all black ensemble, teaming a tank top with matching leggings for a classic, sporty look.

It seemed like she might have been taking style tips from fellow contestant Carole Baskin, seeing as the former Bachelorette wore a leopard-print face mask and matching scrunchie.

Bristowe twisted her hair into a messy but chic bun and popped on a pair of amber sunglasses to finish the look.

Right behind was The Real hostess Jeannie Mai, 41, who tried to escape the LA heatwave wearing green bike shorts and a cropped, yellow bra top. 

She carried her things in a large, green bowling bag which looked like it could fit much more than the average purse.

White sneakers, sunglasses and a face mask rounded out Mai's look.

Meanwhile, Tiger King star Carole Baskin, 59, was on the prowl in a red leopard-print top and burgundy trousers.

The documentary stand-out/big cat advocate's mask appeared to be of her own making, featuring the viral star's catchphrase: 'Hey you cool cats and kittens' and whiskers on the front.

Anne Heche, 51, looked ready and rearing to go, making an entrance in a belly-baring ballerina-pink top and running shorts which revealed a sliver of a butterfly tattoo on her lower back.

Backstreet Boy A.J. McLean, 42, arrived incognito, hiding his entire face with sunglasses and a mask, pulling up the hood of his dark sweatshirt over his baseball cap for good measure.

The cast assembled amid reports of more personnel changes on DWTS, who decided to ditch hosts Erin Andrews and Tom Bergeron for Tyra Banks this season.

Now, Banks is hinting that judge Len Goodman may be taking a step back from the show due to coronavirus travel restrictions.

Talking about the judge's panel during a chat with Entertainment Tonight, the 46-year-old model said: ' 'Carrie Ann [Inaba] is definitely back, and Bruno [Tonioli], who I can't wait to vibe with because he is just as crazy as I am.'

'At the moment, we're trying to figure out how to incorporate Len Goodman because he is in England, and there's all these travel restrictions because of COVID-19. So we're trying to figure that out.'

Len has been with the show since 2005, only taking a brief hiatus during season 21 before returning for the next cycle. 

While Tyra wasn't sure about the situation, insiders told Us Weekly that the network is actively working to figure out how to include Len, even if remotely.

Season 29 of Dancing With The Stars premieres September 14 on ABC with a special two-hour episode to kick off the season.
