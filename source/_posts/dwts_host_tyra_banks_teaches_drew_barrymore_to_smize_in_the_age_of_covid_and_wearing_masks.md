Dancing with the Stars' new host Tyra Banks never realized how important her trademark 'smizing' move would be in the age of COVID-19, and she gave a tutorial on Thursday's episode of The Drew Barrymore Show.

The 46-year-old self-described 'Smize CEO' instructed the 45-year-old Golden Globe winner how to smile with her eyes while wearing a mask, which is mandatory in most public spaces.

'I created smizing really just about having an intense look and gaze in a photo, I never thought in a million years it would mean so much more and come to mean so much more and be so important today with us wearing masks,' Tyra marveled.

'How many times have you been out and about walking and you have on your mask and you think someone is being really mean to you or rude? It's not that they are, it's just that they are smiling with their mouth and not with their eyes so they just look evil. So it's important.'

First, Banks asked Barrymore to think of something that delighted her.

Drew replied that her two daughters - Olive, turning 8 on September 26; and Frankie, 6 - with ex-husband #3 Will Kopelman 'make me smize.'

'I want you to think about your daughters,' the two-time Daytime Emmy winner began.

The two-time Daytime Emmy winner said: 'Your eyes begin to squint, your mouth becomes slightly numb and all the energy comes up here and you're like, "Yeah baby"

Tyra added: 'A smize today means thank you or a smize means you go first or a smize means I'm going to be here during this difficult time you are going through right now. So it means so much and so it's so important to use these muscles here and not just the muscles here'

'Your eyes begin to squint, your mouth becomes slightly numb and all the energy comes up here and you're like, "Yeah baby." Now a smize doesn't just mean I'm fierce.

'A smize today means thank you or a smize means you go first or a smize means I'm going to be here during this difficult time you are going through right now. So it means so much and so it's so important to use these muscles here and not just the muscles here.'

Tyra was on the CBS-syndicated daytime talk show to announce the launch of her ice-cream brand SMiZE Cream with flavors like 'Breakfast All Day' featuring bacon, toasted waffles, maple syrup caramel.

'It is like all-natural super-premium ice cream,' Banks described.

Filling big shoes: Not everyone was a fan of the SI Swimsuit stunner replacing longtime hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews on the dance competition, which features Chicago P.D. actress Anne Heche (R)

Not everyone was a fan of Banks replacing longtime hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews on the dance competition - which features Tiger King star Carole Baskin, Backstreet Boy AJ McLean, and Chicago P.D. actress Anne Heche.

The SI Swimsuit stunner had to restrategize her 2020 after indefinitely postponing the May 1 debut of her 21K-square Glamour Shots-style theme park ModelLand inside Macerich's Santa Monica Place.

After 15 years on The CW and VH1, Tyra's original series America's Next Top Model has been off the air since April 10, 2018.

And though he'd never admit it, RuPaul Charles has Banks to thank for the overall format of his Emmy-winning hit VH1 competition RuPaul's Drag Race, which concluded its 12th season in May.
