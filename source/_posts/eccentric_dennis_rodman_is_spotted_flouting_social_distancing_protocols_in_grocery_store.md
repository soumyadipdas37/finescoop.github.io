Dennis Rodman has been spotted flouting social distancing guidelines as he went shopping in California. 

The former NBA star appeared to have forgotten about social distancing and mask protocol as he shopped in Whole Foods Market on Monday in Tustin, California. 

The flamboyant 59-year-old seemed to be in very high spirits as he chatted to fans and shook their hands while brandishing an unlit cigar and wearing his face mask around his chin. 

The source who shot the video told DailyMail.com: 'I was pretty shocked to see him there in public, in the middle of a pandemic without his mask on. It never actually covered his mouth.'

Rodman wore a red t-shirt from the line FTP or F*ck The Population T-Shirt Company. 

He paired it with blue track pants and his signature dark sunglasses and a baseball cap. 

With a cigar in one hand, he shook the hands of his fans with the other, all while his blue protective mask was below his chin. 

The fans around Rodman kept their masks on as they interacted with the NBA star. 

At one point Rodman went around to the people in the store and hugged them while saying, 'Give me love'.  

Rodman, who is a friend of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, is known for his eccentric antics. 

He even admitted it in ESPN's Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance when he said: 'I was shocked that the Chicago Bulls even asked me to come. I think I was a little too eccentric for them.'

It's unclear what color Rodman's hair was while he was at the grocery store as he wore a baseball cap, but he is known for having vibrant colors and designs including cheetah print,  bleach blonde and slime green.

Rodman, who has dated the likes of Madonna and Carmen Electra in the past, has been involved with social issues lately. 

In June, he pleaded with demonstrators to protest police brutality peacefully. 

Rodman condemned looters in a social media video at the time, saying 'we're human beings, not f***ing animals.'   

He weighed in on the demonstrations to protest the killing of George Floyd, saying that protesters were crossing the line into looting and rioting over Floyd's killing.

'Someone needs to come out and say, 'Hey, guys. Why are we looting? Why are we stealing? Why are we creating more issues?'' Rodman said in the video. 

'This is a bad, bad situation - but [if you're going to protest], protest in the right way. You don't have to go and burn down things, steal things.

'We're human beings, we're not f**king animals.'
