As Lionel Messi decides between staying for one more year at Barcelona, or staying on strike and stepping into a legal battle that could wreck his season, he knows there is no easy way out of this situation.

He can take to Instagram and tell supporters that he wanted to bring to a dignified end his 20 years at the club but it has not been possible so he will now stay until June 2021.

But it will still leave him with the onerous task of going back into the club's Joan Gamper training ground, taking the PCR coronavirus test, training in isolation while results are confirmed, and then finally becoming one of Ronald Koeman's players just two weeks after telling him he didn't want to play for him.

Lionel Messi is set to decide on staying one more year at Barcelona or continuing his strike

Messi has told the club he wants out but Barcelona are standing firm and plan to keep him

There would be an awkward reunion with team-mates who have remained almost unanimously silent since he sent his burofax to the club telling them he now considered himself a free agent.

The captain question will have to be answered. It will be one thing to pull the jersey on again, but the armband?

Ronald Koeman was already thinking about who might be his new fourth skipper. 

Barcelona have four captains and Marc-Andre ter Stegen was the favourite to join Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Sergi Roberto. Will Messi want to step back into the group of leaders?

Will he want to wear the armband and address his team-mates having made it clear in the last two weeks that he no longer wants to be at the club?

If Messi does return, he has serious questions to face over whether he should remain captain

Koeman has made no secret of his desire to only work with players who want to be at Barcelona. He said as much in his presentation. So where would this leave their relationship?

The Dutch coach knows that the crown weighs heavy. He has been a Barca legend who had to navigate the final seasons of his career.

But as a manager he has built a reputation as a disciplinarian who sees treating players differently according to who they are a weakness.

Koeman has talked about Messi finding his place in his new-look team. That's a big step back from every other coach's desire to build the team around the No 10.

There have been suggestions of a desire to 'do away with certain players' privileges'. Such whispers imply a culture of indiscipline and they smack of a crackdown on Messi being viewed at the club as 'a separate case' for all he has achieved. 

There would be an awkward reunion with team-mates should Messi decide to return

Things will never be the same again and even if Messi sees this as something he will do until June 2021 when he will leave the club this time with no blurred lines over his legal right to do so, it could be a long nine months.

Elections are next March and that could provide relief in as much as it removes Bartomeu and his board from the presidency.

But Messi will again be the face of the election with candidates vying to do their best by him.

He is tired of being accused of picking the players the club signs, and choosing who the manager is. 

In five months' time he will be the man picking the next president according to the enduring accusation that he dictates what happens at the club. It will be exhausting for him to just think about it.

Josep Bartomeu insists that Messi cannot leave the club for nothing and has a £630m clause

But think about it is what he will be doing on Wednesday. Is he so upset that he will gamble on the prospect of a legal battle forcing Barcelona to negotiate his transfer? Or does he give in?

Is there a possible third way whereby he fights, but fights nicely, saying to Barcelona: it's not you it's me, telling them the 8-2 to Bayern destroyed him and he should be allowed to leave for their good as well as his. Or does he just give in?

Judging from TyC's story in Argentina on Tuesday night it now looks extremely tough for him to be able to leave – at least without spending the season in court instead of on the pitch - but it will be no easier to stay and make things work after all that has taken place.
