Just because she's in quarantine doesn't mean she can't make a fashion statement.

Vanessa Hudgens served serious amounts of look in a tiger print Gucci sweatshirt and orange tie-dye sweatpants.

The actress, 31, was spotted rocking the fierce look while out with her pal, GG Magree, in Los Angeles on Monday.

Now that temperatures have cooled down in LA, Vanessa was significantly more covered up in comparison to earlier days.

In addition to her long-sleeve top and sweats, Vanessa wore a black hat, sneakers, and face mask.

The High School Musical star braided her long, brunette tresses into two, allowing them to dangle over her chest.

She injected another pop of color with her long, neon yellow nails.

GG followed close behind in a white crop top, black biker shorts, and face mask over her complexion.

Though they had their faces covered, there was no hiding their inner happiness.

The women beamed with joy as they strolled across the parking lot, even sharing a warm embrace inside the store.

At one point, the women were seen driving inside Vanessa's white Bentley convertible. 

Vanessa and GG have become thick as thieves in recent days, with the women spending plenty of time together during their frequent outings.

But GG isn't the only friend in Vanessa's life.

The actress also has her beloved dog Darla, whom she recently paid tribute to on National Dog's Day.

'Happy #nationaldogday I can’t imagine my life without Darla. #adoptdontshop,' Vanessa wrote on Instagram, along with a sweet video of her pooch.
