In May, he opened up to People about the challenges of expanding a young family.

'In a weird way, I think we're looking forward to the challenge,' he said. 'The whole experience of having a child is like none other. It's a rush of emotion and love that can hardly be explained.

'We're looking forward to experiencing that again and then just knowing we're going to be finished. This is our family, and let's grow together.'

He noted of having a young family, 'We do have more challenging days hey definitely keep us busy and are nonstop entertainment for us. 

'At times we would enjoy a little bit of alone time, but for the most part we are having a lot of fun.

He said of quarantining together, 'It's an experience that we would have never had - being at home with the family this long - so we're really just trying to make the most of it.'
