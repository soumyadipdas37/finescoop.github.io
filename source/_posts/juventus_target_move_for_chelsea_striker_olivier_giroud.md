Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud has emerged as a potential target for Juventus.

The Italians champions agreed to release Gonzalo Higuain on Thursday but are struggling to reach agreement with Luis Suarez of Barcelona or their alternative Edin Dzeko of Roma.

Juventus have also considered a return for Everton's Moise Kean but Giroud brings experience and a proven goal scoring record.

Though no offer has been made, he is on Juve's list of options as they strive to add a striker over the next few days.

Giroud, 33, scored his 40th international goal for France this week. 

He signed a new contract at Chelsea earlier this year after seeing potential moves to Inter Milan and Lazio fall through.
