Joe Rogan fans have been left disappointed after the outspoken comedian's podcast back catalog was noticeably missing controversial episodes featuring the likes of InfoWars host Alex Jones and comedian Chris D'Elia, who has been accused of sexual misconduct.

The Joe Rogan Experience arrived on the music streaming service Tuesday, potentially taking listeners from the likes of Apple and Google where previous episodes are available.

However, social media users and even past guests whose episodes were missing suggested Spotify had censored the clips and wondered whether Rogan's $100million deal announced in May meant his non-politically correct style would change.

'If they left these podcast out just think about how many guest he can't have on without spotify's approval, so much for free speech Joe,' one fan wrote.

Interviews featuring the likes of InfoWars host Alex Jones (pictured) were not initially available but Jones said in a video that he spoke to Rogan who said the  interviews will be uploaded later

Others said Rogan was 'dead to me' if he didn't address the issue and claimed he had 'sold out.'

Rogan had previously reassured fans that the show will be exactly the same and it was just a licensing deal, 'so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.'

However the missing episodes prompted social media users to confront the brand online as they suggested Rogan may have had no idea himself that certain interviews were missing.

'When can we expect to see the full library of @joerogan's JRE Podcast on your platform? Some eps are missing,' one fan tweeted Spotify just minutes after the September 1 switchover began.

Spotify's customer care account managers seemed to believe it was down to a user glitch with one social media manager replying, 'Sorry for the confusion! Could you DM us your account's email address? We'll take a look backstage.'

Another replied: 'Can you tell us more about what's happening exactly? We'll help out.'

Rogan switched to the streaming service as part of a $100million deal that started Tuesday but some fans said he had 'sold out' when they saw missing clips

Blogger Mikhaila Peterson, the daughter of controversial professor and public speaker Jordan Peterson, said that her episode being left out was worse than getting demonetized from YouTube

However her August 2018 episode was added after she went on a Twitter rant on Tuesday

After others chimed in with accusations of censorship, the Spotify Cares account responded that it would pass along their 'input to the team for review.'

Some fans called it a 'huge fail' from Spotify and threatened to boycott the brand, noting that it was too much of a coincidence that the episodes missing happened to be some of the most controversial.

One includes where Joey Diaz joked about coercing female comics into performing oral sex. An episode featuring marijuana activist Tommy Chong was also missing.

Eagle-eyed fans also pointed out that podcasts featuring right-wing figures such as Owen Benjamin, Stefan Molyneux, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes and Charles C. Johnson hadn't been uploaded.

Blogger Mikhaila Peterson, the daughter of controversial professor and public speaker Jordan Peterson, said that her episode being left out was worse than getting demonetized from YouTube.

'At least they didn't shut down my channel. However this is COMPLETELY different,' she tweeted on Tuesday.

Others were missing, including one in June with Chris D'Elia (left) who said he had never 'knowingly pursued any underage women at any point'

As others wondered whether the missing episodes were a stunt to generate a buzz about the switchover and demand for the interviews, Peterson tweeted: 'Is it censorship? A mistake!? Was it Joe's decision? Is it censorship!?'

Day one of the programming on Spotify kicked off with a five-hour-long marathon cast with actor Duncan Trussell.

Shortly after she asked whether she was 'making a fuss for no reason,' noting that it was only the first day of the deal, Peterson told followers that 'Alex Jones says these episodes will be uploaded at a later date and it is not censorship.'

Her episode is now streaming on Spotify. 

However others were missing, including one in June with Chris D'Elia who said he had never 'knowingly pursued any underage women at any point.'

Several women have recently claimed he exposed himself to them including actress Megan Drust, Laura Vitarelli, and another woman who has asked to remain anonymous for personal reasons.

Jones said in a video addressing the controversy that the podcast is currently in a 'no man's land' while they continue to migrate episodes until the end of September when it will exclusively be on Spotify.
