Summer is officially behind us as parts of the UK recorded the coldest September night on record, the Met Office confirmed.

Large waves battered the coastline around the UK and chilly temperatures gripped the nation.

The village of Katesbridge, in Northern Ireland's County Down, fell to a teeth-gritting -3.7C (25.3F) - a new September minimum temperature record for Northern Ireland. 

Katesbridge is reportedly well known for often recording Ireland's highest and lowest temperature due to its geography.

East Anglia, the south east of England and Yorkshire experienced a cold and cloudly weekend with rain and strong northerly winds, while the rest of the country enjoyed blue sky and crisp, autumnal weather.  

Parts of the UK hit highs of 26C (77F) this time last week, so the colder temperatures on their way next week are a clear departure than from the warmer temperatures the UK experienced this summer.  

Meterologist Tom Morgan, of the Met Office, said: 'For most parts of the country the weekend will end on a sunny but rather chilly note.

'I'm afraid there is no indication of any warm weather returning. 

'We can sometimes in October get temperatures in the 20s, very occasionally. 

'But these coming weeks look quite cool and temperatures are below average for the time of year. 

'It's been really quite noticeable in the last week how temperatures have plummeted and we've gone from what felt like summer this time last week to definitely autumn at the moment.

'We've had some quite cold nights and that's going to be the same in coming nights,' he added.

Temperatures are set to rise into the high teens on Monday and Tuesday this coming week, with forecasters suggesting areas in the south east will experience balmy highs of 18 or 19C (66F).

For most parts of the country the weekend will end on a sunny but rather chilly note, with temperatures set to fall to around 14 degrees

But the Met Office warned it is only a shortlived return to average temperatures. 

'By Wednesday we're going to see low pressure dominating, bringing spells of rain for all areas and temperatures will be back down to around 14 to 16 degrees if we're lucky,' added Tom. 

Waves battered the British coastline this weekend as gusts reached up to 40mph.

The Met Office warned that giant waves breaking on the shore are likely to lead to further coastal erosion.  

'It's still very windy today but we're not seeing winds anywhere near as strong as we have a couple of days ago. 

'On Friday we had gusts of 67mph on the most exposed parts of Nofolk and Lincolnshire. 

'But it is still gusting at about 34 to 40 mph on the coast in East Anglia and Kent today. Those will ease down markedly in the next 24 hours or so. 

'Those are unusually strong winds for September for that part of England. 

'It's all down to an area of low pressure sitting in the north sea, and that area of low pressure was causing a strong northerly flow, bringing winds all the way down from the Arctic. 

'Bringing a cold pool of air with it, but also causing the waves to crash on shore onto the beaches leading to some coastal erosion and large waves.'
