Health Coach Eloise, 37, (pictured) has been single for six months 

ELOISE, 37

Dating Past?

I was married to a guy I was with for seven years, but we divorced as we realised we were living more as friends. I came out later in life, at 30. I was attracted to women in my teens, but had my first son at 17, so focused on being a mum.

I use dating apps, but prefer to meet people organically.

Pre-date nerves?

Single for six months, two sons aged 20 and 14.

CURRENT ROLE

Yoga and health coach.

WOULD LIKE TO MEET

Someone who is emotionally intelligent and charismatic, with varied interests.

I thought I would be nervous as it’s so unusual to go on a blind date these days, but I’d read Bethany’s description and all of my friends agreed she sounded like the person for me. Also, as a former lawyer, I’m used to meeting new people.

Now I’m a yoga teacher and a vegan (I know, cliché). For the date, I picked a lovely vegan restaurant in North London, which was half-way between both of us.

First Impressions?

Bethany arrived before me and was already at our table when I got there. It’s rare I keep someone waiting! She was instantly friendly and warm, but I knew straight away there was no romantic attraction for me.

Easy to talk to?

Bethany works with dogs and puppies and it sounds like a dream job. I loved hearing about the animals she looks after, and how she helps owners gently realise that having a puppy is like having a child.

My mum has two rescue dogs and I’d love to have one myself, but that would be hard for me right now.

We also talked about where we have travelled. We’ve both been to Thailand and I’ve lived in Cambodia. It was a really lovely way to spend an afternoon.

Embarrassing moments?

None.

Did sparks fly?

For me, unfortunately, definitely not. The spark is either there or it isn’t. I’d like to keep in touch with Bethany, though.

What do you think she thought of you?

I think she liked me and I hope we stay in touch as friends.

Would your friends like her?

They absolutely would, Bethany would get on with anyone.

BETHANY, 35

Dating Past?

The last person I dated was much younger than me. She was a chef and I was cabin crew for Virgin Atlantic at the time — it was fabulous because I got paid to travel the world, but neither of us had much time for one another.

I’ve had my heart broken a couple of times, but I always give myself time to recover.

Pre-Date Nerves?

I was a little nervous because I haven’t been on a blind date in ages, but my friends were reassuring and reminded me that I’m very chatty. They told me not to forget to let her speak!

Single for two years, no children.

CURRENT ROLE

Freelance dog walker.

WOULD LIKE TO MEET

Someone who is funny and who appreciates family values. When I go on family holidays, I’d like it if she could come, too.

First Impressions?

I arrived 15 minutes early. I hate being late and I always like to scope out the other diners. I was wearing jeans, ankle boots and a silk shirt, and Eloise was wearing a black dress with a leather jacket and trainers. She is really beautiful, with icy-blue eyes.

Easy To Talk To?

It was like we’d known one another for years. We’ve both been through recent career changes: I’m hoping to study veterinary medicine, while Eloise has left law and is a yoga teacher and health coach. She is also studying Buddhism.

I’m in Alcoholics Anonymous and have been teetotal since the start of the year. There is a lot of cross-over in the teachings and beliefs of both.

Embarrassing Moments?

None. We’d agreed to share some starters and, fortunately, both mentally picked the same three.

Did Sparks Fly?

Yes, I think so. I’d definitely like to get to know Eloise and see what happens. We exchanged numbers and I messaged her the morning after our date — but then I worried I was coming across as too keen!

What do you think she thought of you?

I hope she thinks I’m funny. I was trying to be friendly and easy to talk to.

Would your family like her?

Yes, they’d love her. She’s warm and puts you at ease straight away.

LIKED? That we laughed a lot.

REGRETS? None.

COFFEE OR CAB? Coffee

LIKED? Bethany was really friendly.

REGRETS? None.

COFFEE OR CAB? Coffee.
