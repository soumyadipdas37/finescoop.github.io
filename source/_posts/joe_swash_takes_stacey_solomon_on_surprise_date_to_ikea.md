'You get me. Even though you instantly regretted your decision when you saw the Fejka section. I made myself a nice bouquet. Grabbed a basket I definitely don't need and a giant pack of Daims. And now we are off to get some dinner...

'I'm guessing it'll be a McDonald's the way this nights going. Thank you bub. Happy Friday everyone... I hope you're all ok! Love you lots, always.'
