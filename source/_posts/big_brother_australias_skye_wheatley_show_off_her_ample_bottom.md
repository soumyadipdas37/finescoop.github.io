Skye Wheatley is no stranger to showing off her incredible figure. 

And on Thursday, the former Big Brother star was flaunting her ample derriere in an Instagram photo. 

The 26-year-old dropped her orange workout tights and turned her back to the camera to reveal her g-string.

The very revealing pose left little to the imagination, and the blonde beauty pouted for the camera. 

She added a matching crop top to the outfit, a pair of white socks and sneakers, as well as wearing her hair in a ponytail. 

Skye wrote in the caption: 'Home workout in my favs' referring to her workout gear. 

Supersized: Last week, Skye had fans questioning whether she's gone too far, after debuting an extremely inflated pout online

Last week, Skye had fans questioning whether she's gone too far, after debuting an extremely inflated pout online. 

The mother-of-one uploaded a TikTok video of herself immediately after getting her lips tattooed - a procedure which often causes the lips to swell up for a short period of time. 

Skye explained in the video that she wanted to fool her boyfriend Lachlan Waugh into thinking she'd permanently engorged her lips with filler.

Oh my God': Lachlan looked completely horrified after noticing Skye's new lips

'Hey guys, so I just had my lips tattooed and I'm going to try and get Lachy's reaction when he comes home. I's going to be so gold!' she giggled.

'He's going to freak!' she continued, wiping away drool from the centre of her mouth.  

The video cut to a shot of Skye approaching Lachy in the living room.  

Lachlan looked completely horrified after noticing Skye's new lips, before she revealed the gag. 

Pranked! 'Do you like the new lips?' she teased, prompting Lachlan to bluntly retort: 'No, no I don't'
