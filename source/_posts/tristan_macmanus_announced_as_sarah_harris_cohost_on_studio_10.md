Tristan MacManus has been announced as Sarah Harris' new co-host on Studio 10.

The Dancing With The Stars judge, 38, will appear on the revamped program as of September 14.

It comes after regular Studio 10 panelists Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were axed from the network last month.

Tristan and Sarah will be joined by news reporter Narelda Jacobs, entertainment reporter Angela Bishop, and contributors Denise Drysdale, Jono Coleman and Craig Bennett. 

Joe Hildebrand revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show this week that he has been offered 'a new role' and is in talks with the network about 'what that might be'. 

Tristan said of his new role in an official statement: 'Although people know me as a dancer, I think my mouth usually works better than my feet do.

'This opportunity came out of the blue and I'm really excited to be working with Sarah and learning from her,' the father-of-two continued. 

Tristan shares his two children, daughter Echo, four, and son Oisín, one, with actress wife Tahyna Tozzi.  

Last month, Channel Ten made 25 employees redundant, including Kerri-Anne, Natarsha and weatherman Tim Bailey.

On a recent episode of Studio 10, Kerri-Anne, 66, fought back tears as she acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic had made it necessary to tighten the budget.   

She also thanked her friends and colleagues for their support. 

'I just know I'm back on the "lazy Susan" of television. Yeah, it's very, very tough for a lot of people,' she said on-air.
