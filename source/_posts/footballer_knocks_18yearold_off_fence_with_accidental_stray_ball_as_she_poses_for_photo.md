A Northern Irish teen chose a beautiful spot to pose for a picture - but didn't study her backdrop close enough to notice the football game going on behind her.

Aimee McFadden, 18, and her friend Mia Scullion decided to stop to for a sunset photoshoot in Lurgan, Northern Ireland one evening.

They set up their camera and balanced themselves on a fence, without considering the football pitch behind them.

The pair strike a pose, balancing precariously with one foot in the air, and smiling for the camera.

Behind them, the footballers kick a ball around, until a poor kick sends an accidental stray ball flying towards Aimee. 

It hits her full force and boots her right off balance, legs flailing in the air, as she desperately tries to cling onto the fence with one arm.

She falls to the ground but seems unharmed and bursts out laughing along with her friend Mia.

The hilariously fail was caught on camera as the embarrassed footballers hung their heads in shame.
