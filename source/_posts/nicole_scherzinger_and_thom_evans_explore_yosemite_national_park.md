Nicole looked sensational in her coordinating sporty two-piece which made the most of her taut abs and perky cleavage as she beamed. 

She was feeling playful during the trip as she jumped into the air for the camera while waving her hands around and pulling the impressive stance. 

The stunner wore her hair in loose lengths as she cosied up to Thom,  who went for a simply white tee with shorts for the trip. 

Clearly loving life, Nicole added a caption on the duo of striking pictures reading: 'Never stop exploring and trying new things #yosemite'.

According to reports, Nicole is trying for a baby with her handsome beau Thom after less than a year of dating. 

The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.

A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies.

'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.

'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'

Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives at the time, who are yet to comment.
