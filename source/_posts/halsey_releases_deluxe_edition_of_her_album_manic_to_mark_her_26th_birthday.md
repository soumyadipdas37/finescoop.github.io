'I really was born at 9:29am on nine twenty-nine,' the biracial, bisexual, and bipolar belter wrote. 'You think I'm lying but I'm being dead serious. Okay, I'll prove it.'

The camera then pans over a pink-lit room that features a rocking horse, a baby's crib, stacks of books, and various other furnishings throughout it.

A video of Halsey's family photos being tossed into a pile is then projected on top of the items in the little girl's bedroom before the video, itself, overtakes the screen.  

The audience is first treated to video footage of a much younger Halsey posing on the porch of her house in a white baptism dress, before launching into a full on montage.
