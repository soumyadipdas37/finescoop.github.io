They've been through their share of tough times, but Beau Ryan and his wife of eight years, Kara, were the picture of happiness in a photo shoot for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar Magazine on Saturday.

The 35-year-old Amazing Race host featured alongside his wife in a series of stunning photos for the publication.

In one photo, Beau stood behind Kara with a protective arm draped over one of her shoulders, as the 35-year-old loosely held his hand.

They were both dressed casually in complimentary ensembles, with Beau opting for dark trousers, which he paired with a white T-shirt.

Meanwhile, Kara was dressed in dark grey stonewash jeans, teamed with a dark blue denim shirt, which she wore tucked in and slightly unbuttoned, showing off a hint of cleavage.

It's a sign of happier times for the longtime couple, who began dating when they were just 20. 

Doting dad: Beau told Stellar Magazine that he has grown as a person since becoming a dad to daughter Remi, seven, and son Jesse, three

Beau was at the centre of an alleged cheating scandal in 2015 with former children's entertainer Lauren Brant.   

But five years on, the former footy star has moved on and devoted himself to being a father to his two children and a husband to Kara. 

He told Stellar Magazine that he has grown as a person since becoming a dad to daughter Remi, seven, and son Jesse, three.

'Having kids changes everything because you learn to put other people before yourself, which I never used to do when I was younger,' he admitted. 

He added: 'I'm sort of used to coming last now. Whether it's food that's left over or a chair to sit on, you're the one who misses out. It's just what you do.' 

Although neither Beau or Lauren addressed the cheating allegations publicly, he issued a public statement at the time on The Footy Show, saying he wanted to 'apologise to all of the people who have been hurt recently'.
