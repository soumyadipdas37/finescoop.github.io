She became a dog mom to her poodle mix puppy Oliver back in July. 

And Olivia Culpo clearly enjoys taking her furbaby around town with her as she was spotted with the puppy in hand on Friday. 

The 28-year-old donned a chic look in a black and white knit mini dress she she wore over a long white collared shirt as she stopped by Magpie's in Tarzana.

The former Miss Universe title holder teamed the dress with edgy knee-high black combat boots. 

She carried the copper-colored puppy in one hand and a small black handbag in the other. 

Culpo beamed a bright smile as she exited her car to head in for a sweet treat. 

The model looked glamorous as she left her brunette hair down in a straight style, parted in the middle, and put a bubblegum pink color on her lips.

She documented her first meeting with Oliver when she went to pick him up at LAX International Airport in Los Angeles in July.

The Rhode Island native brought all kinds of doggy toys and items to help make his transition to his new home easier.

'Really hope I'm not missing anything,' she captioned one clip. 

Culpo eventually appeared outside the airport with Oliver in his carrier, which she unzipped the top so her followers could get a view of his copper-colored head.

Details: She shared a snap of her outfit to her Instagram stories, holding a golden drink

Match made in heaven: She has kept fans up to date on her and Oliver's adventures to his first bath to daily nap times, since adopting Oliver in July

After plenty of excitement at his new home, that included a walk on his leash and his first meal, the cute puppy passed out on his dog bed. 

She has kept fans up to date on her and Oliver's adventures to his first bath to daily nap times. 

Culpo revealed last month on her Instagram Stories that she suffers from endometriosis.

'It was something that I was nervous to share because I really didn't know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are,' Olivia told People last week in an article.

'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods. They're not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility,' she added.

The Miss USA 2012 and Miss Universe 2012 winner was diagnosed last year with endometriosis, in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus.

She noted that endometriosis can be 'very difficult' to diagnose and advised women to get their egg count checked and to make sure their painful periods aren't affecting either their ovaries or eggs.
