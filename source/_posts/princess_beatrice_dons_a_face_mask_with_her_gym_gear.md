Princess Beatrice appeared in good spirits when stepping out for a food shop in west London.

The Queen's granddaughter, 32, carried a bag of organic groceries to her car while sporting low-key gym gear and a face mask, yesterday. 

Her appearance is the second time she has stepped out in public since she tied the knot with husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a secret ceremony on July 17.

Beatrice sported a comfortable-looking navy jacket along with matching leggings, while adding a splash of colour with a vibrant blue handbag. 

Meanwhile she ensured she stayed comfortable with a pair of casual white trainers. 

The royal wore her red hair in a relaxed flowing style over her shoulders, and ensured she stayed safe during the trip by wearing a medical grade mask. 

She carried her phone in one hand, and clutched a bag of organic groceries in another.
