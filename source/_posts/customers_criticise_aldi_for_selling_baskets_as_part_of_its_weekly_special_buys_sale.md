Aldi customers have criticised the supermarket for selling $10 shopping baskets as part of its upcoming Special Buys, arguing they should supply them for free like every other grocer.

The German-born retailer will launch the collapsible 'Shopbox' with handles on Wednesday September 9, and they'll be priced at $9.99 with 'Aldi' emblazoned on the side.

At present Aldi shoppers have to insert a $2 coin into their large one-size-fits-all trolleys to unlock them from the pack, and there are no smaller carrier options.

'Selling? WTF seriously? They should be free like other supermarkets,' one person wrote on Facebook in response to the sale.

'If you aren't going to give baskets generally then supply smaller trolleys as an option - they are too big to navigate,' said another.

Others called it reprehensible that the supermarket was trying to make money off a 'simple need'.

But some did like the idea of the basket, saying they could just load up their groceries in it instead of sectioning everything into bags for the boot of the car.

'Own your own shopping basket and carry your groceries easily and safely from the store to your home or car,' the Aldi website read

It fits inside a regular shopping trolley if you wanted to store delicate fruit and vegetables in it and it's able to carry 15 kilos worth of groceries. 

The basket will also collapse flat when not in use so it can be stored - something regular supermarket baskets don't do. 

On the same day Aldi will be selling kitchen gadgets like oven gloves, nylon utensils, Sistema storage containers and egg cups

An Aldi spokesperson told FEMAIL: 'We are working away to reduce our reliance on single use-plastic, having committed to eliminate a quarter of all plastic packaging by 2025.  

'We know customers are looking to do the same, not just when picking up their groceries but in their everyday actions.

'We've never offered free-of-charge plastic carrier bags, avoiding 40,000 tonnes of plastic entering the environment. Our customers are no strangers to bringing their own bag or grabbing a cardboard box off the shelf. 

In next week's Special Buys range, we're excited to offer customers a new reusable way to carry their groceries with the collapsible shopping basket.'

There will also be traditional German cooking ingredients like pretzels, sauerkraut and whole pickled gherkins.
