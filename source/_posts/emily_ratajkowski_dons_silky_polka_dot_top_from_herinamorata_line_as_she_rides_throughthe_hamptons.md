When she's not working on her clothing line, the brunette bombshell and her husband have spent a lot of time frequenting the beach or riding their bikes around the upscale beach town.

The couple started off their quarantine in NYC before fleeing to their Los Angeles abode. After a couple weeks, the model and her Uncut Gems producer husband opted to split time between their city loft and a Hamptons property.

Emily and Sebastian have been married since February of 2018. Though the courthouse wedding came as a shock to most of her fans she had reportedly been vetting Sebastian for over a year before the pair took things to the next level.
