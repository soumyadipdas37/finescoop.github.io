Beyonce has sent her love and support to one of her young fans currently battling brain cancer with a stunning bouquet of flowers.

The 39-year-old megastar had a large white floral arrangement delivered to Lyric Chanel along with a personal note from the Queen herself telling the girl 'you are a survivor'. 

Lyric shared photos of the flowers, the card and a sweet thank you video to Bey on her social media account on Sunday.

'When the Queen Bey sends you flowers,' Lyric's mom posted to her daughter's popular Instagram page. 'Thank you so much @Beyonce Lyric was so shock to get mail from you and she said Beyonce is the Best!!!' 

Adding: 'We love you so much and she hopes to one day meet you.'

Lyric, who could give Bey a run for her money in the style department, looked every bit a star in her own right wearing a matching aqua and lavender Nike ensemble.

The young queen smiled from ear-to-ear infront of the floral arrangement while holding up the card sent by the Grammy winner. 

'I was so moved to see how these lyrics inspired you, not nearly as much as you inspired me,' Beyonce wrote in the message. 'I can't wait to meet you one day and I'm so happy you're home safely. You are a survivor. God bless, B.'

Queens: The note included a line from Love On Top, one of Lyric's favorite songs by Beyonce

The card began with a line from Love On Top: 'Honey, Honey, I can see the stars all the way from here, I can feel the sun whenever you're near.'

The hit tune is one of Lyric's favorites and she recently shared a throwback video singing it when she was little more than a toddler.   

'I was so moved to see how these lyrics inspired you, not nearly as much as you inspired me,' Beyonce wrote in the message. 'I can't wait to meet you one day and I'm so happy you're home safely. You are a survivor. God bless, B.'

The feeling is mutual with these two stars and in her thank you video, Lyric echoed Queen Bey: 'Beyonce thank you so much for these flowers I love you and I can't wait to meet you!'

Wow! The oversized bouquet included orchids, roses and hydrangeas

Since being diagnosed with brain cancer/Anaplastic Ependymoma, Lyric has undergone four separate brain surgeries.

A GoFundMe has been set up to help cover the costs of Lyric's care and so far has raised nearly $76K.

Despite her medical hurdles, Lyric's strength has not waned and she knows she's a queen just like her idol.

In a video her mom said she was so shocked that Beyonce had sent the gift but Lyric knows her worth. 

'You know why? Cause I'm a queen,' the starlet in training said. 'She says she only gives things to queens and I'm a queen.'
