James and Daniel walked hand-in-hand past the paparazzi before the actor lifted his co-star up into his arms to pose for snaps together.

Nowhere Special is an upcoming 2020 internationally co-produced drama film, written, directed, and produced by Uberto Pasolini.

James, who plays window cleaner John, dedicates his existence to his three-year-old son after his mother left them soon after she gave birth.

But when John is given just months to live, he sets out to find a perfect family for his little boy once he is gone. 

Smile and wave! Meanwhile, his co-star Daniel wore a white grandad collar shirt with a pair of black jeans and brown leather shoes

Aw! The actor, 35, put on a sweet display as he carried Daniel Lamont on his shoulders while strolling the length of the carpet

Earlier this week, James was spotted making a low-key arrival at the film festival. 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on Wednesday 2 September and ends on the 12 September. 

James, who recently starred in the BBC drama The Trial Of Christine Keeler, has been hotly-tipped as the latest actor to play James Bond.

The Sun claimed bookmaker Ladbrokes has suspended betting on the star being the next man to portray the fictional secret agent.

Amid frenzied speculation about who will be the next to play Bond, with stars including Richard Madden and Idris Elba being linked with the role, a source told the publication both sides were trying 'to get a deal signed off'.

'Producers wanted a Brit and James ticks all the boxes - tall, strapping, physically fit and, of course, looks great in a dinner jacket.

'Everyone is hoping to get the deal confirmed and signed off, with an announcement in the summer.' 

James, meanwhile plays the titular character Gareth Jones in his drama film Mr. Jones, which was released on February 7.

The movie tells the true story of a Welsh journalist who travelled to the Soviet Union in 1933 and uncovers some unpleasant truths about an international conspiracy.

James also starred in Little Women, alongside the likes of Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, and Meryl Streep earlier this year.
