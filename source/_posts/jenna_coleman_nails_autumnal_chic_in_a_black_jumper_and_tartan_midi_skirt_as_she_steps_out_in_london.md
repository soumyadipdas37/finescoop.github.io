She often showcases her incredible sense of style on many a red carpet.  

And Jenna Coleman proved she could nail off-duty chic just as well as she stepped out in a stylish ensemble while out and about in London on Thursday.

The actress, 34, dressed for the autumn weather in a cosy black jumper and a red and blue tartan midi skirt as she ran errands in the capital.

Jenna teamed her skirt and jumper combo with a chunky pair of black zip-up boots, and kept her jewellery to a minimum with a simple pair of white earrings.

The former Emmerdale star left her brunette tresses loose for the day while her make-up was kept minimal as she also slipped on a floral face mask.

The beauty appeared lost in her thoughts as she ran errands during the low-key outing while carrying her keys and mobile in her hand.

It's been a tumultuous time for Jenna as earlier this month, she and her ex, fellow actor Tom Hughes, 35, were pictured moving out of their London home.   

The couple shocked fans when they split in July - having been a couple - on and off-screen - for four years.

But things seemed to be made final as the Victoria stars dealt with matters at their former shared property.

The actress and her Victoria co-star fell in love on set while playing the lead roles of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the ITV period costume drama. 

But they are thought to be keeping things amicable between them. 

An insider told The Sun that the pair have since met up in an attempt to keep things 'as friendly and civil as possible.'

The source said: 'They are trying to salvage a friendship but obviously these are trying times, and it's not easy. 

'Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. There was no third party involved.  

'Jenna's career is going from strength to strength, she's being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she's still young.'
