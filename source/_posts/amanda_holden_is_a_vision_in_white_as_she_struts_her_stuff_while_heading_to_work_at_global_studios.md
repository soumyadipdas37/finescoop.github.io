Amanda oozed elegance in the chic number which was perfect for the end of summer climes descending on the capital.

The Britain's Got Talent judge recently spoke on the show's controversy regarding Diversity's dance performance about Black Lives Matter and police brutality.

Ofcom complaints have soared to 23,308 over the performance which featured a portrayal of a policeman kneeling on Ashley Banjo's neck.

On Good Morning Britain this week, Amanda said: 'It is extraordinary. I think the number of negative complaints means this conversation is right and fundamental and should continue to happen.

'What hasn't really been highlighted is the fact that we were inundated with overwhelming positive response, hundreds of thousands of them. 

'As BGT family, and Diversity is very much part of that family, and Ashley is doing a phenomenal job on BGT, we stand by him and stand by that performance 100 per cent.'

The star added of Ashley Banjo: 'He sends out positive vibes to both the haters and the lovers of the piece that they did. He is saddened by negativity.' 

Presenter Piers Morgan, 55, reiterated his support for the routine saying: 'If you can't handle that without feeling the need to never watch BGT again or to complain to Ofcom, there's something wrong with you. 

'You, you're the problem! You're part of the problem.

'By the way, if you don't like me saying this, then don't watch us either. Don't watch Good Morning Britain. Because I agree with Ashley Banjo and Diversity. And if you can't handle it Britain, wake up.'
