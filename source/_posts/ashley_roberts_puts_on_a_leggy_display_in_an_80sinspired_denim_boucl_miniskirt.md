She has an enviable work wardrobe that most women can only dream of. 

And Ashley Roberts debuted another stylish ensemble as she left Global Radio studios after recording her Heart FM show in central London on Thursday.

The former Pussycat Dolls singer, 38, exuded glamour in an 80s-inspired denim bouclé co-ord as she sauntered out to her car.

Ashley put on a leggy display in her statement two-piece which featured a denim waistband, cuffs, and puff sleeves. 

Her outfit was adorned with decorative gold buttons which complemented her gold rimmed sunglasses.

The broadcaster teamed her two-piece with a spotless white T-shirt and grey patent stilettos. 

The radio host added a designer touch with her cream leather YSL handbag.

She styled her blonde locks in an elegant low ponytail and opted for a natural make-up look. 

Ashley revealed last month that she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future.

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29. 

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. 

'It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'
