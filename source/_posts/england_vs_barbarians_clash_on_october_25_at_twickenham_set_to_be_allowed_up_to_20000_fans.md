Up to 20,000 supporters are set to be allowed into Twickenham to watch England take on the Barbarians on October 25. 

The game takes place a week before Eddie Jones's side face Italy in their rearranged Six Nations finale and fans will be able to attend, pending government approval. 

The RFU have outlined a number of safety measures that will be put in place with less than 25 per cent of the stadium’s total 82,000 capacity in use on the day. 

Eddie Jones's side are set to play in front of up to 20,000 fans in their clash with the Barbarians

- Above normal staffing levels for the crowd size in order to manage social distancing and safety measures

- Mandatory use of face coverings by spectators except when in assigned seats or eating or drinking

- All tickets for the match will be digital and, with the exception of accompanied children and those with accessibility requirements attending with a companion 

- Each mobile ticket will need to be on a separate device

- One way systems to manage crowd movement

- Assigned entry gates to minimise the build-up of queues

- Extensive queue lanes outside the stadium, on Rugby Road and Whitton Road to manage socially distanced queues

- Hand sanitisers will be provided throughout the stadium

- External toilet provision will be the same as an 82,000 capacity match, despite the reduced spectator numbers

- The cleaning and waste collection regime will be significantly increased
