Jack Fincham has revealed he is missing his baby daughter Blossom. 

The Love Island star, 29, who announced he had become a father in January after a brief relationship with friend Casey Ranger, took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a sweet throwback snap of his little girl, eight months. 

It comes after Jack flouted social distancing rules at the weekend by posting a slew of pictures of his partying with a marquee-full of people in Kent.

Jack captioned the sweet photo of Blossom in a white baby-grow with a pink hair ribbon: 'Miss my baby. The time will come. Love you Blossom.'

It's unclear why Jack isn't seeing Blossom and fans soon flooded the comments asking the reality star, with some suspecting the pair were taking precautions after Jack partied with a crowd of people amid the coronavirus pandemic.

One wrote: 'Ah why haven't you seen her?', while another follower queried: 'Oh no are you not seeing her :( so sad xxx'.

A third chimed: 'Ah can you not see her? She's your double.'

One fan said: 'Just seen online he was in a packed bar yesterday so I think the mum is protecting the baby obviously because of Covid.' 

MailOnline has contacted Jack's representatives for comment.

It comes after Jack deleted a string of Instagram posts, uploaded on bank holiday Monday, featuring him and a marquee-full of people flouting COVID-19 rules.  

The television personality decided to film the event and upload around 10 Instagram Stories on Monday afternoon and evening, as he and his friends attended the BBQ and disco held at The Swan in West Malling, Kent.

But clearly realising that doing this incriminated all involved - making them eligible to be fined £10,000 under the newly enforced rules for mass gatherings - Jack removed the evidence on Tuesday.

Neither Jack's representatives nor The Swan pub replied to MailOnline's request for comment on Monday evening.

The pub has also removed all traces of the event from their Facebook page, which had previously advertised the party with a picture of a marquee and balloons and details of the food, drink and music. 

The Swan charged revellers £120 each for the pleasure - promising to adhere to social distancing and the pandemic public safety guidelines.

Evidence: Jack not only attended the event, but filmed himself and all the attendees, plastering it across his social media accounts

It posted the following message ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only.  

'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point.

'We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe.'

Yet Jack's social media posts saw him kissing an unknown brunette woman on the cheek while they partied under the marquee, hugging his friends as they drank and dancing with a mass of people as night fell.

The ex-reality personality flouted COVID-19 rules, along with the other attendees, who were all seen crammed into the event despite the 2m+ rules that are still in place in England.
