She's been setting hearts on fire wearing an array of eye-catching bikinis ever since jetting off for a post-lockdown break in Ibiza. 

And on Wednesday, Demi Rose showed her cosy side as she posed for a series of sexy snaps from the comfort of her bedroom. 

The Birmingham-born model, 25, took to Instagram to showcase an oversized pink and orange tie-dye hoody that offered just a glimpse of her famous curves.

Hair today: The social media celeb ran her hands through her raven tresses as she revealed the graffiti-style pattern on the front of her top

In two of the shots she lay on her side, running her hands through her raven tresses as she revealed the graffiti-style pattern on the front of her top. 

Demi posed for the snaps in what appeared to be her bedroom, sprawling on a kingsize bed with burnt orange sheets. 

Floor to ceiling windows gave a view of sun-dappled pine trees, the view from her lavish villa.

Change of expression: Demi offered just the hint of a smile as she captioned the album, 'My two moods'

Demi offered just the hint of a smile as she alluringly captioned the album, 'My two moods'. 

Despite her contented appearance here, Demi has recently lamented being marked after being stung by a jellyfish. 

Turning to her Twitter followers, she penned that she was disappointed she couldn't enjoy a peaceful swim without jellyfish surrounding her. 

Demi added: 'It’s Jelly season over here in ibiza and it’s just impossible to swim without getting stung'.

Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling.

Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.

Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.

Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.'

Ouch! Despite her contented appearance , Demi has recently been lamenting how it is currently jelly fish season in Ibiza
