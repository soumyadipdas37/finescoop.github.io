Rebel Wilson and her boyfriend Jacob Busch made their red carpet debut on Wednesday, as she graced her first red carpet since shedding more than 40 pounds. 

As they attended Prince Albert's Planetary Health Gala together, the Pitch Perfect actress, 40, and Busch, 29, looked happy in love with their arms wrapped around each other.

Donning a cleavage-baring gown, the star showed off her incredible weight loss and aimed to bring back Hollywood glamour with her blonde tresses in loose waves.

In the group shot, the lovebirds, who were introduced by a pal last year, stood close together and smiled softy at the camera. 

While the Isn't It Romantic star and Busch, 29, held back on any public displays of affection, they are reportedly 'officially boyfriend and girlfriend.'  

'He's a gentleman, has very old school manners and treats her well,' a source told People of their relationship dynamics. 

Despite initially isolating in Australia amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Wilson eventually joined Busch's quarantine in Los Angeles.
