The Voice Australia will air on Seven for the first time next year, after Channel Nine chose not to renew its contract.

And it seems the end is nigh for celebrity coaches Delta Goodrem, Guy Sebastian, Kelly Rowland and Boy George. 

According to Woman's Day magazine, sources claim it's 'highly unlikely' that Seven will keep the four current coaches - with Delta Goodrem reportedly being replaced by Ricki-Lee Coulter. 

'Ricki is in a good spot to replace someone like her': Channel Seven is reportedly considering axing Delta Goodrem (left) from The Voice and replacing her with Ricki-Lee Coulter (right) when the show returns next year 

'[Delta] no doubt wants to be at the helm of the show - she's very passionate about it - but Ricki is in a good spot to replace someone like her,' a source claimed. 

'She's already a Seven talent, thanks to her hosting gig on Australia's Got Talent and she fits perfectly with the network's push to make the show local and familiar,' they added.  

The publication also claimed Seven has approached singers Lorde and Tones And I to join the 2021 coaching panel - likely replacing international stars Kelly Rowland and Boy George.

It comes amid reports Seven is set to axe Nine's international stars as part of a 'cost-cutting measure'. 

'One of the big changes Seven plans to make is how much is being spent on judges,' a source close to The Voice reportedly told The Daily Telegraph. 

'They believe Nine was simply paying too much for a bunch of B-listers.'     

New coaches? The publication also claims Seven has approached singers Lorde (left) and Tones And I (right) to join the 2021 coaching panel 

Too expensive? Delta, who is rumoured to earn between $1million to $2million a year, is out of the network's price range, according to The Daily Telegraph 

Long-serving coach Delta, who is rumoured to earn between $1million to $2million a year, is also out of the network's price range, according to the publication. 

The Daily Telegraph claimed Seven is 'in talks' with American R&B star Usher, while other replacements include Kylie Minogue and homegrown talent, Jessica Mauboy.    

Meanwhile, Sonia Kruger, who previously hosted the singing competition and is now over at Seven, has been confirmed to host the series in 2021. 

Any truth? It is claimed Seven is 'in talks' with American R&B star Usher (left) and Kylie Minogue (right)
