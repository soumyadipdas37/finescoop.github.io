Google released its next generation Pixel smartphone that is an affordable 'high end' device that takes aim at Apple’s iPhone.

The firm held its 'Launch Night In' online where it unveiled the Pixel 5 that starts at $699, along with a budget version, Pixel 4a 5G, for $499 – both are at least half the price of the Cupertino company’s handsets.

With the reduced price comes some sacrifices, the Pixel 5 has a less powerful processor and display than competing devices.

However, the firm notes both devices are water resistant, include reverse wireless charging, support 5G networks and have a longer battery life.

Along with the smartphones, the event also introduced a $100 Nest Audio speaker, a new Chromcast and the firm’s new streaming service, ‘Google TV.’

Google released the first generation Pixel smartphones in 2016 that were deemed to have the camera of any other handset on the market.

However, it seems that the tech giant has struggled to make a big splash into the market, but the new affordable 'high-end' model- may be the stepping stone it needs.

The Pixel 5G and Pixel 4a 5G are designed with a new ultrawide lens, along with the standard rear camera.

Both also come with Cinematic Pan that Google says ‘gives your videos a professional look with ultrasmooth panning that’s inspired by the equipment Hollywood directors use.’

Pixel 5 also have all-day batteries that last up to 48 hours using Extreme Battery Saver, which automatically limits active apps to just the essentials to save power. It also boasts an edge-to-edge screen with a pin hole at the top that holds a camera

One thing these smartphones can do that Apple’s and Samsung’s devices can’t is wait on the line when you call a toll-free number and are put on hold.

‘Built on the smarts of Duplex and Call Screen, this new feature lets you go back to enjoying the things that matter to you, and Google Assistant will notify you once someone is on the line and ready to talk,’ Google shared in a statement.

‘And Hold for Me works on your device, so the entire call is private to you. Goodbye endless hold music, hello more free time.’
