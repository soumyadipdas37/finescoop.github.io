Laura Anderson continued to hit back at trolls on Saturday as she shared another makeup-free snap after sparking controversy with her 'changing face' earlier this week.

It comes as the newly-single Love Island star, 31, appeared on BBC Breakfast earlier in the day to discuss the proposed air-brushing ban.

Tory MP Dr Luke Evans has drawn up a Bill which would mean celebrities would have to label images which have been digitally altered to change how they look.

Laura discussed the proposed ban, which claims edited photos on social media are 'fuelling a mental health crisis' and creating a 'warped view' of beauty.

During the interview, the reality star admitted that despite the fact she edits her own Instagram photos, she would be in favour for the Bill.

She said: 'At first, I wasn't 100% sure but now, honestly, I am all for it. I think it's great that we have choices, we all have our reasons for why we edit.

'Sometimes I edit just to save me some time. I ask friends why they edit, if they're not doing professional brand posts or things, they say it's a confidence thing.

'I think we have to respect everyone's confidence journey, as long as we're honest about it.

'I know if I could see "edited", it would maybe stop me from editing as much. I think that's something positive in the future. I do think we over edit right now.'

Prior to her interview, Laura shared yet another defiant makeup-free snap after sparking controversy with her 'changing face' earlier this week. 

In the picture, the reality star looked radiant as she showed her bare skin and styled her honey coloured locks into a high ponytail.

Hitting back: It comes after the star shared another makeup-free snap earlier this week and 'purposefully put no filter on'

'I didn't even recognise her!' Love Island fans claimed Laura looked 'unrecognisable' as she reunited with her co-stars for socially-distanced filming  on Tuesday (R in 2018)

Laura pouted to the camera and penned: 'Always go to bed with a dream and wake up with a purpose.' 

It comes after the star shared another makeup-free snap earlier this week and 'purposefully put no filter on'.

Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George, said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.

'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse.

She said: 'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.' 

'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. 

'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'    

 Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.

One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! 

Peace: Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George (pictured), said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.'

Another typed: 'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!,' while a third chimed: 'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)

Another follower referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   

The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018. 

TV star previously told The Sun: 'I went for a place that I know does a natural look. I know there's a lot of young people that follow me and I don't want to promote anything like that as it's a dangerous topic really.







Stunned: Under the image shared to Jack's Instagram, social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance 

'People have to feel good [inside] before they do all that I believe that but for me it's something I wanted to do for a really long time and I came out and just did it as I was thinking about it while I was in there.

'It's a touchy subject and I get that and I would never want to promote that to young girls, but I still want to live my life for me. It's hard, but I'm nearly 30.' 

It's been a tough week for Laura as she announced she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom Brazier on Thursday just days after moving back to Scotland.    

Despite initially intending for hunky Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.

'I got so much abuse': 'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse'

The split appears to have been sudden, as Laura last posted a picture with the trainer just six days ago, a day before announcing she'd left London. 

Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north. 

'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.' 

Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.    

It's OVER! It's been a tough week for Laura as she announced she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom Brazier on Thursday just days after moving back to Scotland
