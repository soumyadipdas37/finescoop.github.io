Tyron Woodley made a statement at his UFC Vegas 11 press conference by answering 'Black Lives Matter' to every question.

The former welterweight champion takes on long-standing rival Colby Covington, who has previously shared his support of American president Donald Trump, on Saturday. 

The two fighters held separate press conferences with Woodley turning up wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt and a hat with the words 'Make Racists Catch the Fade Again', in the same style as the 'Make America Great' cap made famous by Trump.

Covington, in contras, wore a similar red cap with the words 'Keep America Great' at his press conference. 

The first reporter asked Woodley whether he was disappointed it wasn't a joint press conference, with the fighter replying: 'I'm just excited that Black Lives Matter.'

Throughout the three-minute conference, Woodley's issued a variety of similar responses ranging from 'I just think that Black Lives Matter,' to 'I hope they realise Black Lives Matter.'

Woodley gave an interview to ESPN earlier this week and confirmed he would wear Black Lives Matter shorts for his fight against Covington.

He also said he would like to see UFC do more to support the movement and highlighted the work of the NBA, who allowed players to wear certain messaging on the jerseys during the play-offs.

Three play-off games were also postponed in August because of a player boycott  after black American Jacob Blake was shot by police in Westconsin.

'I wish the UFC would do a little bit more; I’m really not happy with that,' Woodley said in the interview.

'I had a long conversation with Dana White about it when the riots happened at Ferguson. I wanted them to utilise me to show a positive spin.

'Let’s go give back. Let’s go do seminars with these kids. Mixed martial arts is an affordable martial art that they can do. Start doing seminars, bring some of these guests in and have them talk to the kids about life and what martial arts and the discipline has given to them.' 

The Black Lives Matter movement has taken centre stage in the sporting world in recent months after George Floyd was killed by police in Missouri in May.

Naomi Osaka raised awareness during the US Open by wearing a mask to honour Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police officers who burst into her apartment in March.

Osaka, who went on to win the Grand Slam, recognised a different black American in each round with the aim of highlighting racial injustice in the United States to bigger audience.

Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also paid tribute to Breonna Taylor at the Tuscan Grand Prix by wearing a t-shirt calling for the arrest of the officers who killed her.

Hamilton was facing an investigation for the 'political' t-shirt but the FIA confirmed on Tuesday that no action would be taken.
