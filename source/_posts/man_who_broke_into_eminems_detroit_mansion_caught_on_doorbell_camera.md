Matthew David Hughes, 27, has been charged with first-degree home invasion and malicious destruction of property after he broke into Eminem's home in a gated community in Clinton Township, just outside Detroit, in the middle of the night on April 5. 

The intruder charged with breaking into Eminem's mansion and allegedly threatening to kill him in April was previously captured on a doorbell camera trying to break into one of the rapper's former homes last year.  

Matthew David Hughes, 27, has been charged with first-degree home invasion and malicious destruction of property after he broke into Eminem's home in a gated community in Clinton Township, just outside Detroit, in the middle of the night on April 5. 

Police say Hughes used a brick to smash a window of Eminem's mansion while the rapper was sleeping after slipping past his security. 

Authorities say Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, woke up when his security alarm went off and found Hughes in his home. 

The rapper initially thought the intruder was his nephew. 

Hughes, who police say was unarmed, is alleged to have told the rapper that he was there to kill him.         

Hughes was also arrested in June last year for trespassing on two Michigan properties, including one of Eminem's former homes. 

Doorbell camera footage from that incident - taken outside a mansion in nearby Rochester Hills - showed Hughes trying to enter the home in search of the rapper.

Eminem no longer owned the home at that point and is believed to have sold it two years prior.

Hughes was filmed initially trying to open the front door. He was caught on camera peering into the home before noticing the doorbell 

At one point, he appeared to ring the doorbell and then calmly waited outside the door. The homeowner later told police in that incident that Hughes was 'looking for his brother, Marshall'

The homeowner later told police in that incident that Hughes was 'looking for his brother, Marshall'. 

Hughes was told to leave but was later found hiding in the property's gatehouse. He was subsequently arrested for breaking and entering and sentenced to 90 days in jail.   

The footage re-emerged this week as Hughes faced court over the most recent incident stemming from April.   

Clinton Township Detective Dan Quinn testified on Wednesday during a court hearing that multiple angles of security footage showed Hughes on the premises for 'quite some time' before he climbed through the smashed window. 

The rapper, who has a net worth of $210 million, woke at about 4am on April 5 after hearing his security alarm go off when Hughes allegedly smashed a window. 

When he went to investigate, Eminem told police he found Hughes standing in his living room.   

The officer who responded to the scene that night, Adam Hackstock testified that he arrived to find Hughes wrestling with a security guard outside the mansion. 

The officer testified that Eminem told him he had woken up and found Hughes standing in his home.  

'When Mr Mathers asked him why he was there, he was told by Mr Hughes that he was there to kill him,' Hackstock said on the stand. 

Hackstock said that Eminem told him he escorted Hughes out of the home through a TV area, game room and basketball court.

He shouted for his security who detained Hughes until officers arrived. Hughes was taken into custody that same day.

Hughes appeared in Macomb County District Court on Wednesday. He is being held on a $50,000 cash bond and the judge denied a request by Hughes' attorney to reduce the bond

Eminem is well-known for his 2000 track 'Stan' which tells the story of an over zealous fan who becomes a stalker named Stanley 'Stan' Mitchell. 

The influential song is where the term 'stan culture' comes from, describing dedicated fans of famous stars, who refer to themselves as 'stans.' 

The song is a cautionary tale to fans about taking everything your idol says literally. 

In the lyrics, Eminem reveals how the character Stan starts writing him several letters, over three verses, where he becomes more obsessive and angrier when he doesn't get a reply from the star. 

Authorities have previously said they believe Hughes wanted to meet the rapper face-to-face.  

Authorities have said Hughes is homeless and his court-appointed attorney had initially sought a competency hearing for him, which Hughes declined. 

'In my opinion, I think there´s some sort of mental issues involved here,' defense attorney Paul Glanda said outside court on Wednesday in reference to his client. 

Hughes is being held on a $50,000 cash bond and Judge Jacob Femminineo Jr denied a request by Hughes' attorney to reduce the bond.

The judge ruled there was probable cause to move forward with a trial.

He scheduled a September 28 arraignment in Macomb County Circuit Court.

Eminem was not in court on Wednesday.
