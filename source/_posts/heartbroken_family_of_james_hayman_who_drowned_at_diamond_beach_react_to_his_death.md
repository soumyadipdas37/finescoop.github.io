The grieving family of a teenage boy who drowned in rough surf at an un-patrolled beach have remembered him as a 'quiet sort of kid' who aspired to become a chef.

James Hayman, 17, was swimming at Diamond Beach near Hallidays Point, about 104km south of Port Macquarie, at 1pm on Wednesday when he suddenly vanished. 

His father, Peter Hayman, almost lost his own life after jumping into the surf in a desperate attempt to find James.

'It's very difficult. We're still trying to come to terms with it…we're quite distraught,' James' grandfather, Paul Hayman, told The Daily Telegraph.  

'He was a quiet sort of kid really, and he was in to cooking. I think he wanted to go in to becoming a chef when he finished school. That was one of his big aims.'

Police eventually found James and pulled him from the water and started CPR before paramedics arrived and took over.

He was unable to be revived and was declared dead at the scene. 

Police said it was 'reasonable to assume' that James' death was caused by either strong tides or a rip.  

Mr Hayman suffered injuries from water inhalation during his rescue attempt and is recovering in hospital. 

His wife Melissa and youngest son Tom, remain by his side waiting for him to be discharged.

Paul said the family holidaying with some family friends and it was not a 'frequented area'.  

He recalled the beautiful moments when James was growing up and stayed with him and his wife Helen. 

'We saw them quite a bit. They would stay over at our place sometimes … they've always been fairly close.' 

James' tragic drowning on the mid north coast was the third this week.

Steven Pearce, CEO of Surf Life Saving NSW, said that it was a tragic start to the school holidays.

'This is a heartbreaking incident, and our thoughts are with the boy's family at this time,' he said. 

'Please, if you're heading to the beach these school holidays or this coming long weekend, swim at a patrolled location and always swim between the red and yellow flags.
