Aubrey Plaza has been on break from her leading lady duties, since she began quarantine with partner Jeff Baena. 

But the comedic actress has been making it through with some virtual appearances and her daily walks.

She masked up and kept it cute Saturday in a faded pink tie-dye t-shirt, as she took her dogs Frankie and Stevie out for a walk in her Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, during a break from isolation.

The 36-year-old complemented the top with some skinny jeans, which hugged her toned legs, and a pair of white sneakers.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of round tortoiseshell sunglasses, a silver necklace and a white face mask.  

Plaza recently reunited with her Parks and Recreation costars for a virtual town hall, benefitting the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.

She answered frequent voter questions about mail-in ballots: 'I don't want to be a negative Nancy... But a lot of people forget to include a [copy] of a photo ID... 500 people in Madison sent in selfies.'

The Delaware-born actress previously joined her Parks and Recreation costars back in April for a virtual reunion episode, benefiting Feeding America.

She starred as snarky intern April Ludgate on the workplace comedy, which ran from 2009 to 2015 on NBC. 

Plaza told Variety: 'A long, long time ago, [April Ludgate] was based off of me in real life. It’s a very personal character, so to be asked to get back into that mode 10 years later, it brought up a lot of things.

'It really was just about trying to remind myself how that character evolved over the years. It was fun, but it was also a daunting task.'

The reunion special also featured Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O'Heir and Retta. 

Plaza can also be seen starring alongside Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Davis, Dan Levy, Clea DuVall and more in the LGBTQ holiday rom-com Happiest Season, which premieres November 25.
