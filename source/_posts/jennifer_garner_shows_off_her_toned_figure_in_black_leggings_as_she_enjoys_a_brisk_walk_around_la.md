Jennifer Garner put her hard work at the gym on display, as she headed out of the house in a pair of form-fitting black leggings on Friday. 

As she enjoyed a walk around her Los Angeles neighborhood with a female pal, the 48-year-old Golden Globe winner dressed to highlight her lean and muscular legs. 

Staying cautious of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, she kept her nose and mouth covered under a white floral face mask.

The mother-of-three paired her sporty ensemble with a black tank top, a grey baseball cap and blue sneakers. 

She opted to tie a white sweater around her waist, which further emphasized her fit physique. 

As the duo chatted away on their stroll, they kept some distance between them and appeared in high spirits.

While Garner appeared vigilant about keeping her facial covering on properly, her friend kept her respective mask lowered under her chin. 

Her outing comes days after it was reported that the actress felt her ex-boyfriend, John Miller, 'brought her back to life' after the end of her marriage to Ben Affleck. 

Garner and Miller dated for two years before calling it quits in early August.

John 'became someone very significant,' proving 'that there were men who could be trusted,' a source told Us Weekly, earlier this week. 

The insider noted that he made Jennifer 'feel beautiful, confident and sexy.'

The lovebirds are reportedly still friends following their split, the outlet's source said.

Jennifer and John had conversations about marriage 'but Jen couldn't see herself married to him' and 'couldn't commit.'

The source revealed that 'he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her,' and 'was devastated' since he 'was ready to propose.'

John, who is the CEO of CaliGroup, was previously married to Caroline Campbell; they share two children. 

The way they were: 'Jen says John brought her back to life,' according to the source, although 'it just wasn't meant to be;' Jennifer and Ben picture at the 85th Annual Academy Awards on February 24, 2013

An additional source told Us Weekly: 'John and Jen are in similar places in their lives and can relate to raising kids after a divorce,' adding: 'They're on the same page and understand where things stand.'

Jennifer and Ben, 48, in 2004 and married on June 29, 2005, in Turks and Caicos; they announced their separation in June 2015.

They filed for divorce in April 2017 and it was finalized in October 2018; the stars have been co-parenting their children: Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, eight.
