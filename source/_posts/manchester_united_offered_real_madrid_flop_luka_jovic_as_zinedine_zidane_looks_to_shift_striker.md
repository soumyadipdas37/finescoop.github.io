Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Luka Jovic on loan from Real Madrid.

Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane is happy to let Jovic go and the 22-year-old has been offered to a number of clubs around Europe.

Jovic joined Madrid from Eintracht Frankfurt for £55m last year but he has managed just two goals in 28 appearances and has been hampered by niggling injuries.

The 22-year-old has failed to make his mark since arriving in the Spanish capital for £55m

Tottenham discussed the possibility of signing him during negotiations to sign Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon but ultimately opted against it.

United's main forward target remains Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho but, with finances restricted, they are exploring other options in case they fail to prise the winger away from Germany.

Watford's Ismaila Sarr has been discussed but is unlikely, Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic is an option on loan while they have also been offered former Paris St Germain striker Edinson Cavani who is a free agent.

Talks are ongoing over a deal to sign Porto left-back Alex Telles while United midfielder Andreas Pereira is expected in Rome ahead of a medical with Lazio on Wednesday.

AC Milan are also in discussions about a deal for full-back Diogo Dalot.

Meanwhile, United defender Max Taylor, 20, is training with Kidderminster Harriers as he awaits news on a prospective loan move.
