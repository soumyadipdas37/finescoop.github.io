The new poster for the latest James Bond movie, No Time To Die, was finally unveiled on Tuesday evening, after the film's release was delayed by seven months.

Shared on the official James Bond Twitter and Instagram accounts, the poster shows franchise star Daniel Craig, 52,  looking debonair in a classic black tuxedo.

Getting into character as the suave agent 007, the actor stares menacingly at the camera as he totes a small pistol, while the film's title is set in gold lettering.

Captioning the image, the promotional team wrote: 'Man on a mission. Check out the new poster for #NoTimeToDie, in cinemas this November.'

It was also revealed that a new trailer for the highly anticipated film will be released on Thursday, though the exact date of the film's release remained notably vague.

The poster comes after it was alleged that the film's release date is set to change once again, after the COVID-19 crisis led the launch to be delayed by seven months. 

Alteration: It has been claimed that the film's release date is set to be changed once again, after the COVID-19 pandemic  stalled the James Bond film's launch by 7 months

It was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the pandemic, before being brought forward to November 8. 

According to a recent report from The Sun, it was being considered whether the film's release should be moved yet again over fears of losing money at the box office.

It was claimed that the continued increase in COVID-19 cases in the US meant film executives were concerned about how many people would be able to see it.  

A source told the publication: 'There are secret talks about what to do. Having No Time To Die earning less than half a billion would be deemed a disaster no matter the circumstances.'

MailOnline contacted EON productions for comment at the time.

In June, No Time To Die's official Twitter account confirmed that its release date had been moved forward by two weeks.

The tweet read: 'The return of old friends in NO TIME TO DIE. In cinemas 12th November UK, 20th November US!'

The upcoming movie will mark Daniel Craig's last-ever outing as the iconic character., which the actor insisted he was 'fine' about.

He said: 'I'm really... I'm OK. I don't think I would have been if I'd done the last film and that had been it. But this, I'm like... Let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm fine.'

The actor also insisted he isn't too worried about his post-Bond career.

Changes: In June, the film's official Twitter account for the project confirmed that its release date had been moved, to two weeks earlier than originally planned 

He said: 'I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.'

Daniel was more involved in the writing of the new movie than he has been in the past, including having Phoebe Waller-Bridge brought on board to tweak the script. 

Producers are also reportedly planning a spin-off based on the spy's recently-discovered daughter, penned by the Killing Eve' scribe Phoebe.

Sources claimed bosses have approached her to pen a franchise documenting how the offspring of 007 becomes an agent herself.

It comes following reports that Bond is set to to have daughter in the long-awaited film No Time To Die.
