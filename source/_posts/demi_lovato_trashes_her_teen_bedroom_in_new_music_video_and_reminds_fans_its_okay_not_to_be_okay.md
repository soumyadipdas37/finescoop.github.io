Demi Lovato and Marshmello partnered up for an inspiring music video for their new track, OK Not To Be OK, to support suicide prevention and mental health education. 

The powerful ballad, released on Thursday, is packed with lyrics that serve as a reminder to let go of feelings of self-doubt and not succumb to negative thoughts. 

In the video, the two-time Grammy nominee wakes up in a suburban bedroom, filled with plush pillows and collages, before running to see her teenage self in the mirror.

While the 28-year-old self stares into the mirror, the reflection shows a younger version of herself looking back with butterfly clips in her hair and a pink t-shirt. 

Additionally, the reflection shows Lovato rocking bangs, reminiscent of her days on Disney Channel, and colorful Silly Bandz around her wrists. 

The rubber bracelets may be a nod to a 2008 incident, when her publicity team claimed red marks and 'indentations' on her wrist, at a red carpet event, were caused by wearing 'tight' bracelets, not self-mutilating.

The Confident hitmaker, who previously revealed she suffered from suicidal thoughts at just 7-years-old, sported a dissatisfied reflection and begins to trash her bedroom. 

After throwing everything off her desk, she kicks a shoe box on the floor, as she sings about tackling self-acceptance accepting. 

'Don't get lost in the moment or give up when you're closest, all you need is somebody to say, it's okay not to be okay,' she sings in the chorus.

Making peace with herself: After winking at the camera, she and her childhood self can be strutting down the sidewalk with beaming smiles and surrounded by butterflies

She, then, throws off her duvet cover and bedding, before she stares at the camera, sitting on, a white chair with a smile. 

'All you need is somebody to say It's okay not to be okay,' the performer croons, while wearing a dramatic hot pink eyeshadow and a lime green long sleeve.

Dancing: Her younger self has a bit of a wardrobe change, as she now wears a purple bucket hat

Marshmello, who also woke up in his childhood bedroom next to a Game Boy and other Nineties nods, can be seen rocking out on a keyboard, before going for a bike ride.

'We are excited to be teaming up with Demi Lovato and Marshmello on this project to break the stigma around mental health on world suicide prevention day,' said Hope For The Day Founder and CEO, Jonny Boucher in a statement.  

Lovato, a longtime mental health advocate, has long been open about her struggles with substance abuse, disordered eating and mental illness.

After the video's release, she asked her followers to take 'a moment today to check in with yourself and your loved ones.'

Her openness is what prompted Marshmello to join forces with Lovato for their mental health anthem.

'I think a lot of people, about negative feelings and negative thoughts that are affecting them are kind of scared to bring it up, scared to talk about it,' the DJ told ET.  

He continued: 'When in reality, they’re scared because maybe the person won’t relate or the person won’t understand, when in reality most of time the person that you could bring it up to, will most likely has felt like this or will understand or can relate as well. So I think it’s very important to talk about it.'
