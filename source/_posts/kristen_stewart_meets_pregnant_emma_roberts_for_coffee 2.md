Emma Roberts officially confirmed she and partner Garrett Hedlund are expecting their first child, a baby boy, yesterday.

And the Scream Queens actress, 29, made time for friends that Sunday, seen meeting up with fellow star Kristen Stewart, 30, at a Starbucks in LA.

Roberts seems to be keen on connecting with close ones lately, snapped out after her A-list aunt Julia Roberts, 52, congratulated the Nerve actress on her pregnancy.

Emma and Kristen were both casual for the outing, donning simple leggings for the coffee break.

Despite the warm weather, Roberts decided to keep on a well-tailored jacket which concealed her burgeoning belly. She completed the look with sunglasses, her favorite croc-skin YSL purse, checkered slip-on sneakers, and of course a mask.

Kristen, on the other hand, went for sporty chic in Adidas trainers, their iconic tri-stripe leggings, and a cropped t-shirt.

The Twilight talent had her hair raked back into a messy half-ponytail, showing off her natural color as she appeared to be growing out a previous bleach job.

The actresses were joined by two friends. After getting their drinks the group gathered in the parking lot for a quick hang out. Emma was tickled by whatever Stewart had to say, flashing her sparkling Roberts smile during the chat.

The actress completed her laid-back ensemble with the ‘C’ medium bag by Celine.

The handbag is designed with textured black leather, gold-tone hardware and a chain shoulder strap for a luxe style that will never go unnoticed.

It seemed like Emma was over-the-moon after announcing her happy baby news with some stunning portraits of her and her love on Instagram that same day.

Miss Roberts was flooded with well-wishes from friends, family, castmates and fan, even getting some love from very private aunt Julia Roberts, who is the younger sister of Emma's actor dad Eric. 

The Pretty Woman actress joined the likes of Jamie Lynn Spears, Awkwafina and Lea Michele, taking to the Instagram announcement to write 'Love you' with a series of kissing emojis.

Emma's Scream Queens co-star Lea - who recently gave birth to her own baby boy Ever Leo - also chimed in, writing: 'You will be the greatest mama! I love you Em! Boy moms together.'

Back in July, it was reported that Emma knows the sex of her baby, but hasn't picked out a name yet and wants to keep things 'private for now'.

An insider said: 'They know the sex of the baby but are keeping it private for now. They haven't picked out any names yet.'

The news comes after it was recently reported Emma and Garrett were 'surprised, shocked and happy' to be expecting a baby together.

Another source added: '[They are] surprised, shocked and happy at the same time, and so are their families.'

Emma was first rumored to be expecting a baby in June, and just a few days later, the news was seemingly confirmed by her mother Kelly.

When one fan asked on Instagram if Emma was pregnant, Kelly simply replied: 'Yes!!' And when another said she would make 'an amazing grandmother', she responded: 'Thank you so much! Very excited.'

Emma and Garrett were first romantically linked in March 2019 when they were spotted holding hands in the Silver Lake neighbourhood of Los Angeles.
