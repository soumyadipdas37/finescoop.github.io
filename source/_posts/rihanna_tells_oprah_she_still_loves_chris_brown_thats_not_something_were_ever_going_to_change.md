Rihanna says she is still in love with ex Chris Brown, 12 years after her attacked the starlet and threatened to kill her during a violent argument while driving around Los Angeles.

The talent talked about mending her relationship with Brown during an appearance on Oprah's Supersoul Conversations podcast, where she admitted she'll always have feelings for the X singer, who she now considers a close friend. 

'We've built up a trust again, and that's ... we love each other and we probably always will.' Rihanna, 32, told O. 'That's not something we're ever going to change. That's not something you can shut off, if you've ever been in love.'
