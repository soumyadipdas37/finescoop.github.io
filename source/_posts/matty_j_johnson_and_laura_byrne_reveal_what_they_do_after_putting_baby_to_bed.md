Matty 'J' Johnson, 32, and Laura Byrne, 33, regularly speak about being first-time parents. 

And now the fun-loving pair have revealed what they get up to after they put their daughter, Marlie-Mae, one, to bed for the night. 

In footage posted to Matty's Instagram, the couple proved they're partial to a dance with children's supergroup, The Wiggles. 

Get busy: In footage posted to Matty's Instagram, the couple proved they're partial to a dance with children's supergroup, The Wiggles.

'It's time for bed,' he told Marlie-Mae, before sitting down to watch the TV. 

He then appeared to get entranced by the song Vegan Hot Dog with him doing the dance moves in his living room. 

At that moment, Laura walks in and recognises the song and says: 'Oh, Vegan Hot Dog' as the pair dance in their living room.  

'Vegan Hot Dog...gets me every time,' Matty captioned the clip.

The skit comes after the young parents rejoiced in enjoying a child-free night at upscale restaurant Catalina At Rose Bay last month.   

Taking to Instagram, Laura showed the couple cosied-up together as the sun set on the harbour behind them. 

'The faces you make when Nana comes to babysit,' she wrote in the caption.

Matty also shared a photo of himself making a funny face as he embraced a beaming Laura. 

'This is what [Laura] gets when she asks for a nice photo,' he joked in the caption. 

The Bachelor couple's date night out comes after Laura revealed she was offered money to marry an Italian student so he could get his permanent visa and stay in Australia.

She explained on her podcast Life Uncut that an ex-boyfriend had asked her if she would consider marrying one of his friends so he could continue living in Australia. 

'This Italian guy had approached my ex-boyfriend at the time and was like 'hey, how would you feel if I pay you a certain amount of money, and I marry Laura to get permanent residency?' 

She recalled that her boyfriend asked how would she feel about doing it, 'I was like, 'not good, not good,'' Laura said, laughing at the absurdity of the situation. 

Fortunately, she never followed through with the offer, as marrying someone in order to get permanent residency carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $100,000 in Australia.
