She was living the high life in Monte Carlo with her new boyfriend, Jacob Busch, earlier this week.

And Rebel Wilson's life of luxury continued on Wednesday as she and her toyboy lover flew by private jet back to the U.S.

The actress, 40, shared an Instagram Story from their stopover at Shannon Airport in Ireland, and wrote in the caption that they were 'stretching their legs'.

Living the high life! On Thursday, Rebel Wilson shared an Instagram Story video of herself and new boyfriend Jacob Busch in Ireland as their private jet stopped over at Shannon Airport following their recent red carpet debut in Monte Carlo

She dressed for comfort during the long-haul flight in a grey jumper with black leggings and sneakers, while Jacob opted for a blazer, jeans and loafers.

The pair hammed it up for the camera, with Anheuser-Busch heir Jacob doing high kicks as the Pitch Perfect star preened. 

The comedian also posted a clip of herself telling her followers: 'Hey we're in Ireland!'

She turned the camera around to show Jacob waving and also revealed a glimpse of their private jet.

'Just stopped over just for like 30 minutes,' she boasted. 'So just stretching our legs here in Shannon, Ireland.'

Back on the jet, Rebel showed off their mid-flight snack consisting of panna cotta, chocolate-covered strawberries and tarts. 

She also shared a glimpse of the pilots in the cockpit.

Rebel and Jacob made their red carpet debut at the Planetary Health Gala in Monaco last week.

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser.

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of $13.4billion.

The pair's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for Jacob, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59.

Meanwhile, Rebel continues to impress her social media followers with her incredible body transformation.

Back in January, she declared 2020 her 'year of health', and has so far lost at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).

According to People magazine, Rebel's remarkable transformation is partially down to following the Mayr Method diet plan.

Blue beauty! At the start of the year, Rebel declared 2020 her 'year of health', and has so far lost at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone). Last month, she showed off her slimmed down physique in a tight blue wrap dress on Instagram (left). Pictured right in May 2019  

'It's an approach that eliminates food intolerances, reduces sugar, encourages eating whole foods slowly, boosts the immune system and reduces inflammation,' a source said.

'She exercises with a personal trainer up to six times a week, goes on walks and is trying to up her protein intake nutritionally.'

Her personal trainer recently shared her workout routine with E! Australia.

During a typical week, Rebel does a combination of HIIT workouts, mobility, weights and resistance, and has just one day per week of rest.
