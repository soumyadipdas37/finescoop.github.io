Kate is a well-known animal lover and in addition to Ingrid has two cats, Clive and Willow, and a Pomeranian dog named Myf. 

During lockdown, Kate has been amusing her fans with her antics with her pets, often sharing amusing videos with her furry friends. 

Meanwhile, it's been reported that Kate has been getting serious with beau Goody Grace, 23, with whom she was first romantically linked back in April, when they were spotted holding hands while out for a walk.   

A source told HollywoodLife: 'They actually have a lot in common. Kate is a free spirit and she appreciates that Goody is talented. He’s really mature, and they can have deep conversations but also can be really playful and goofy at the same time.

'She just enjoys being with him and she loves him for who he is. He treats her with complete respect and what else could a woman ask for in a partner.'

They took a big step back in July, when they publicly dropped the 'L' bomb to each other on her 47th birthday.

'HAPPY BIRTHDAY I LOVE YOU,' he commented on her Instagram post, to which she responded: '@goodygrace I love you [kiss face emoji].'

It came after she clapped back at a troll who criticized their age gap in an Instagram comment earlier in the month.

'Why do you keep dating guys that could be your children?' he asked, to which she quipped: 'Every relationship I have had has been solely to annoy you.'

She and Goody reportedly also have the stamp of approval from her daughter Lily Mo, 21, whom she shares with ex Michael Sheen, 51.
