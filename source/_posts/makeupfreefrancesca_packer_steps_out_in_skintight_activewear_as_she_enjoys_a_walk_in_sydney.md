She's the niece of billionaire businessman and casino baron James Packer.

But on Wednesday Francesca Packer-Barham, 25, proved she's just like the rest of us as she enjoyed a morning walk through Sydney's Royal Botanic Garden.

The brunette beauty wore comfortable black and white patterned sport tights and a white crop top for the outing.

Francesca's outing comes after she reportedly set a new record, spending more than half a million at a recent jewellery auction.

Earlier this month, Private Sydney claimed she was the mystery bidder of a stunning diamond ring, which went under the hammer by auction house Leonard Joel. 

The brunette beauty reportedly dropped $575,000 for the emerald cut diamond.

Her stunning new sparkler weighs in at 17.34 carats and surrounded by a band with a pavé-set of brilliant-cut diamonds.

The publication also reported Francesca's big spend broke the previous record spent on jewellery, which was $450,000.

That record sale was of a beautiful 8.19 carat heart-shaped diamond necklace, back in 2011, according to the Sydney Morning Herald at the time.

Francesca's lavish splurge on the ring comes after she purchased a $16million penthouse in Sydney's Darlinghurst.

The apartment, designed by Australian-Austrian architect Harry Seidler, features five spacious bedrooms and five bathrooms.

It also boasts extravagant views of the harbour and luxurious fittings, including Cote D'Azure marble and designer lighting.

The selling point of the penthouse is undoubtedly its balcony, which offers stunning 360 degree views of Sydney Harbour.
