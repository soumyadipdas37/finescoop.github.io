The author of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's biography Finding Freedom has told how he is 'grateful' that it is still 'riding high' as a bestseller a month after its release date.

The controversial biography written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand has raised eyebrows for its gushing praise and intimate knowledge of the Duke, 35, and the Duchess of Sussex, 39 - but the Duke and Duchess of Sussex claim they were not interviewed and did not contribute to the book.

Taking to Instagram, royal correspondent-turned-author Omid addressed his 22, 000 followers and penned: 'So grateful to see Finding Freedom still riding high on The Sunday Times bestseller list almost a month since release. Thank you again for the continued support.'

To those asking for more language options, the list is growing (15 and counting!) and we'll have more details soon...'

It comes after the book was declared a bestseller with 31,000 copies sold in the UK in the first five days of its release, according to figures from data provider Nielsen Book.

The book has also topped Amazon US and Amazon UK best-sellers charts.

The biography offers a window into Meghan and Harry's lives during their time as senior royals, and is full of details on their shock exit from the royal family.

It addresses the alleged rift between brothers Harry and William, as well as the relationship between their wives.

Omid went on to reassure those asking for more language options, that 'the list is growing' - with 15 and counting! (pictured)

Scobie said that while they did not interview the couple, 'many' friends gave them insights - providing 'a lens to the couple through their friends and their circle of aides'.

The royal commentator gave several high-profile interviews to publicise the book in the week since its release.

But royal expert Katie Nicholl said the authors may be the 'only winners' from the publication of Finding Freedom.

Writing in Vanity Fair, she asked if the book was 'worth it for Harry and Meghan' before adding: 'The irony of Finding Freedom is that, locked down in their rented mansion in LA, the Sussexes have less freedom than they did when they lived in Windsor.'

Meanwhile she added that the book's authors write that the monarchy had lost two of its greatest assets.

She concluded: 'They, perhaps, might be the only winners in this rather sad story.'

The book had reached number one on Amazon's Top 10 New York bestseller in 24 hours list on the day of its release for pre-order.

Meanwhile in July, 14 days before its release, the biography also topped the media giant's bestsellers list as royal fans rushed to pre-order their copy.
