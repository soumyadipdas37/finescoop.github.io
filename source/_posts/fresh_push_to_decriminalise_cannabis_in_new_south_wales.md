New South Wales Labor MP Rose Jackson has called for cannabis to be decriminalised saying it would be an 'economically sensible' move

Calls for cannabis to be decriminalised are growing with one MP saying the drug is no more addictive than booze or tobacco. 

New South Wales Labor MP Rose Jackson told parliament on September 23 legalising the drug would be 'economically sensible'.

She argued that the state should follow in the steps of Joe Biden in the US, contradicting Opposition Leader Jodi McKay. 

'Over 33 countries have decriminalised or legalised cannabis and if Joe Biden wins the US election all of America will have decriminalised cannabis,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  

Meanwhile, Ms Mckay told The Daily Telegraph the NSW Labor Party 'does not support decriminalisation of recreational cannabis use'. 

Ms Jackson said it was an 'unbelievable waste' of police and corrections resources to enforce prohibition on the drug. 

'It is no more addictive or harmful than alcohol or tobacco and may in fact be less harmful,' she said.

Ms Jackson told Daily Mail Australia she has supported the cause from the start of her political career. 

'At the very least we should be having a public conversation about decriminalising cannabis,' she said.

'Millions of Australian's have tried cannabis at least once and I reckon it is a conversation a lot of people want our leaders to start having.'  

Ms Jackson said she believed cannabis was no more addictive or harmful than alcohol or tobacco and NSW needed to be 'on the right side of history' (stock picture)

The MP said overwhelming public support for the idea could not be ignored.

'Let us get New South Wales on the right side of history and decriminalise cannabis in this state,' she said.

Her comments came after US presidential candidate Joe Biden pledged to overhaul cannabis prohibition if we won the US election. 

'It is New South Wales that is lagging in not even conducting a public conversation about this issue,' she said. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms McKay's office for further comment.  

Drug Free Australia also slammed the MP's comments and said cannabis was as dangerous as tobacco and increased the risk of psychosis (stock picture)
