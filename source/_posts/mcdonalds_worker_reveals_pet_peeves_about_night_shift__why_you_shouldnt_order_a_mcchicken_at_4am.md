A McDonald's worker has shared her pet peeves about working alone on night shifts, and explained why customers can't get a McChicken at 4am. 

TikTok user fuzzjacq revealed the biggest issues staff face during the early hours, from being abused to dealing with overheating soft serve machines that spew out hot liquid.

She begged customers to be patient, wait their turn and said if they do their orders will be delivered fresh.

Speaking on the video titled 'I talk fast' the worker set the record straight, telling customers she has a lot to do and people need to follow a few basic rules.

The clip starts with her staring straight down the camera and saying: 'Things night shift workers at McDonald's would really like you to take into consideration'. 

TikTok user, fuzzjacq (pictured) shared the video on Tuesday and revealed she receives abuse from customers and asked them to not call her 'lazy '

Her biggest tip to customers was not to order a McChicken at 4.30am because the breakfast menu starts at 4am and there is nothing she can do about it. 

She then told viewers: 'If I ever tell you that I can't do a shake or a sundae because the machine is in heating it means the machine is in heating and spitting out hot liquid. 

'I can not serve that to you. Please order something else, can I get you a frappe?'

The fast food worker also spoke out about being abused by impatient customers.

'I actually have a lot of jobs and detailed cleaning that I need to get done, I don't stand around all night doing absolutely nothing.

'Please do not tell me if I'm being lazy if I'm in the middle of a job.'  

The quick-talker revealed being told to wait 'in park' is a good thing, because takeaway customers will have their order delivered fresh to their car. 

She finished by pleading with people to wait their turn patiently if they turn up to the burger restaurant at night and the cashier window is empty. 

'I am the only one on the floor so I may not be able to get to the window very quickly, I might be serving someone on counter, I might be doing something else, but please just wait at the cashing window.'
