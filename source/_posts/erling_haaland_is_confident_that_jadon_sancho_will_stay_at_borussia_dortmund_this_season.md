Erling Haaland is confident that Jadon Sancho will stay at Borussia Dortmund despite interest from Manchester United.

Sancho has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford throughout the transfer window but a deal has so far failed to materialise. 

United have been unwilling to match Dortmund's £108million asking price for the England international.

Haaland told Viaplay Fotball: 'I think Sancho has been very good throughout the whole pre-season.

'He will be an important player for us this season.'

Asked specifically about the links to United, Haaland said: 'That is not something that I am involved in.

Sancho is the subject of interest from Manchester United but a deal hasn't been reached

'Those in charge are responsible for that. I am not going to comment too much on that.

'But if he stays, I'll be very happy because he is both a good friend of mine and a hell of a player.' 

Sancho has scored 35 goals and provided 44 assists across 100 appearances for Dortmund and is a player of huge importance for Lucien Favre's side. 

Earlier this week Sancho was amongst the scorers as Dortmund commenced their DFB-Pokal campaign with a 5-0 victory away to Duisburg.

Dortmund start their Bundesliga season on Saturday with a home game against Borussia Monchengladbach.

Haaland, meanwhile, scored 16 goals in 18 games last season after making the switch to Dortmund in January.
