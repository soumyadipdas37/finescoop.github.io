Caroline complemented the look with a low scoop vest and added a boost to her statuesque frame with patent black criss-cross heels. 

She slicked her hair back into a low bun and accessorised her stylish outfit with gold hoop earrings. 

Caroline kept her make-up understated and toted a cream silk bag with metallic detailing.

Through her blog, Caroline has partnered with companies like Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and Valentino. 

As she took a seat in the socially-distanced audience, the blonde beauty donned a black face covering. 

Tan was also a predominant feature for Max Mara's upcoming collection.  

Milan is only one of the four fashion capitals that is hosting the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

The city are hosting 23 shows over the next five days- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks. 

Paris has 20 scheduled shows planned next week but coveted guestlists have been reduced dramatically, in keeping with strict socially distancing guidelines.  

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus. 

Back in February, Georgia Armani cancelled his show in Milan as the virus began to sweep through the country.
