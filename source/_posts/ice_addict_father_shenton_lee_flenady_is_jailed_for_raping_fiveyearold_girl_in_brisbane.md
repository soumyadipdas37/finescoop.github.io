An ice addict father who repeatedly raped a five-year-old girl and made a sick collection of photographs of his abuse has been jailed for nine years.

Shenton Lee Flenady, 42, sexually abused the girl - who was not his daughter - for a year and told her not to tell anyone, Brisbane District Court heard.

Police would later find a sick haul of more than 2,000 child exploitation images on four of his online accounts, Quest Newspapers reported.

Flenady, who the court heard has 'many children' of his own, pleaded guilty to a raft of child sex offences.

Judge Paul Smith said Flenady's sexual abuse was 'brazen' and that he used 'violence to discipline her, which explains her silence'.

'This was a vulnerable child who had not yet reached her sixth birthday when the offending began,' the judge added.

The child rapist's defence lawyer Colin Reid said his client was addicted to meth at the time of the rapes, was sorry and was studying the Bible in prison.

Flenady was jailed for nine years and will not be eligible until he has served half of his sentence.
