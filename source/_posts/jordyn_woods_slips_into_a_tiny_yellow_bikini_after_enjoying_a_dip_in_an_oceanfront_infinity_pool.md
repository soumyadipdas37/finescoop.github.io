Jordyn Woods started giving her more than 11.6 million Instagram followers a number of envy-inducing glimpses at her pre-birthday festivities over the weekend.

And on Tuesday, the 22-year-old model put on a very busty display in a plunging, yellow two-piece, after posing on a float in an ocean-front infinity pool.  

While soaking up the sun, she paired her tiny bikini top with a matching marigold sarong, which hugged every inch of her toned frame, and a pair of Chanel slides.

As she leaned back in a plush lounge chair, Woods kept her eyes closed and propped her right arm over her wide-brimmed hat. 

While flashing her sun-kissed legs, the 5ft9in beauty appeared to be enjoying her tropical getaway, at an undisclosed location, ahead of her birthday on September 23. 

She cheekily captioned the image, 'b***h I am a job.'

Earlier in the day, she shared an idyllic shot of herself sporting a form-fitting swimsuit, which matched the exact pattern of her $250 Versace pool float. 

As she hovered above the water overlooking the sea, she sported a pair of black sunglasses on top of her pulled back tresses. 

'By the time they realize your worth, you’ll be worth more,' she captioned her slideshow, just weeks after it was confirmed Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson have romantically rekindled.

At the beginning of 2019, Woods blamed her alleged kiss with the NBA player on being 'blackout drunk' and nothing more than a 'stupid' drunken mistake, an insider told TMZ.

The cheating scandal, which also came as a betrayal to her former best friend Kylie Jenner, ended her relationship with the Kardashian-Jenner family.    

More than a year after the fall-out from the indiscretion, she is 'working' and 'had a stint on a TV show.'

A source furthered noted to People, 'She's not doing too, too much, but is staying busy.'

After the scandal came out into the public, the model was quick to appear on Jada Pinkett-Smith's red table talk to speak about what had gone down from her side. 

During her appearance on the Facebook series, she admitted kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'  

She also broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denied being that the reason Khloé and Tristan's split.

Tristan, who shares a two-year-old daughter with Kardashian, has never publicly addressed his side of the cheating scandal.
