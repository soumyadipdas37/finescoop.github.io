Adding some further glamorous details, Chloe opted for heeled biker boots and a beige fedora hat.

The Goodman sisters appeared to make the most of their shopping trip as they held several carrier bags from Givenchy to Moschino. 

Lauryn welcomed her son Junior with former flame, and England footballer, Kyle Walker in April.

While Chloe gave birth to daughter Isla in May with her footballer fiancé Grant Hall. 

Last month, Lauryn took a swipe at her ex Kyle on Instagram, after the footballer, with whom she shares son Junior, said he is a 'role model'.

She also appeared to throw more shade at the sportsman when she thanked her sister Chloe for sending her bespoke necklace.  

The TV personality appeared to take a jab at 30-year-old Kyle's current drama with fiancée Annie Kilner, 27, amid claims she had a fling with a toyboy when they had split.

Taking to Instagram, Lauryn shared shots of a necklace bearing the initials KW that had been sent to her by her sibling, along with the caption: 'Not my circus.' 

She wrote: 'Thank you Auntie @chloe__goodman for this bespoke @burtandgurtlondon @markjeweller necklace. It's honestly amazing and brought tears to my eyes.

'Junior is so loved and has been the greatest gift to have ever happened to me. I gave birth to my best friend. For those of you who are asking why it doesn't say JW or Junior. KW are his true initials .. x'

The term 'not my circus' is short for 'not my circus, not my monkeys', which means it's not my problem or none of my business. 

Lauryn also accused Kyle of 'stalking her' on social media and acting like their son 'doesn't exist'.

Her post came after ex Kyle is said to have been left devastated after his model fiancée Annie allegedly admitted to a fling with a toyboy during their explosive split.

The Manchester City footballer and Annie broke up in March 2019 after she discovered he had been unfaithful with Ex On The Beach reality star Laura Brown. 

Kyle and Annie have three children together, and during their split, he fathered a child with Lauryn Goodman - a son who she refers to as Junior, six-months-old - following a whirlwind romance. 

The on-off couple rekindled their romance in June where he is said to have proposed to the mother of three of his children.
