Vogue Williams has revealed Skepta is on her 'laminated list' and she was annoyed at his rumoured romance with Adele. 

A 'laminated list' is detailed on Urban Dictionary as: 'A list of the top 5 people, usually celebrities, with whom you could have sex with without repercussions, if the opportunity arose, regardless of whether you were in a relationship or not.'

Chatting on their Spencer & Vogue podcast, Spencer, 32, poked fun at Vogue, 34, for her love of the grime genre of music before she made her big reveal.

Vogue explained the stark difference in the couple's music taste, as she said: 'So Spenny and I have very, very different taste in music and I went into the bedroom the other day and he is blasting James Blunt...

'Squealing along in the shower [laughs], so that’s what I’ve heard from the bedroom. You know what though, you give me so much s*** when I’m listening to my own music, and I just leave you', before Spencer then branded her music 'c**p'. 

As the former MIC star teased her saying: 'Honestly if you met these grime artists, they would literally be like “oh god, another one who thinks they’re cool', 

Disgruntled Vogue responded: 'That’s unfair because you’re saying Skepta, who’s on my Laminated List, would not fancy me, and that’s a bit mean.'

After many months of romance over a relationship between Skepta and Adele, Vogue then admitted she's upset over their rumoured romance.  

Vogue asked her doting husband: 'Do you reckon Skepta would want to, I’m not going to say go out with me, that’s a bit far, do you reckon he would deffo kiss me?' 

He then responded: 'I set myself high goals, so that others are jealous', to which a tickled Vogue went on: 'That’s good, I was kind of annoyed with Adele for a while because she was going out with his'. 

Uh oh! After many months of romance over a relationship between Skepta and Adele, Vogue then admitted she's upset over their rumoured romance

Elsewhere in the podcast, the couple sparred over who is more recognisable - leading to Spencer claiming prisoners liked him.

He said: 'Prisoners love me. I get approached quite often by people who’ve served time and apparently Made In Chelsea is a mega hit in jail and because I was a bit of asshole on Made In Chelsea, I’m their favourite, so there.' 

Vogue hilariously hit back: 'I don’t want to be known for something like Made In Chelsea anyway, I’m like trying to get away from you'.
