Lee Johnson always ensured Bristol City were in the Championship play-off conversation - in the past three seasons at least - but they never quite got themselves into the top six.

While it’s early days yet, there are more and more signs of encouragement that his former assistant Dean Holden might finally get them there.

There was some criticism from the Robins fanbase when owner Steve Lansdown decided to look within Ashton Gate when appointing Johnson’s successor, especially when more prominent names like Steven Gerrard and Chris Hughton had been linked.

But Holden couldn’t have done any more this season as he quickly places his stamp on a team that should be good enough to be in the promotion shake-up once again.

They had an impressive hold on this contest and claimed a deserved three points at what is traditionally one of the trickier Championship away venues. It is now four wins from four in this fledgling season in league and cup.

Nahki Wells scored on the stroke of half-time to give just reward to an opening 45 minutes of Bristol dominance. The way they shut down the contest after half-time was equally impressive and Andreas Weimann capped a fine afternoon’s work by adding a late second.

By contrast, there are alarming signs that Stoke face a depressing re-run of last season’s relegation strife. They may have shocked Wolves in the Carabao Cup but they’ve also scored just once in four matches.

Worse still, the Potters didn’t muster a single shot on target and manager Michael O’Neill doesn’t have to search too far to diagnose the malfunctions within his team.

The Northern Irishman looked thoughtful as he chewed gum in his technical area, mulling on a dearth of creativity and probably little change of rectifying it now on the club’s shoestring transfer budget.

When 33-year-old Steven Fletcher, a free signing after his release by Sheffield Wednesday, is your only summer acquisition in attack, there’s every chance of a long season in prospect.

Sam Vokes was ineffective in the first-half, while Jacob Brown faded. Fletcher replaced Vokes at half-time but also received scant service.

Had there been Stoke fans present, there would surely have been vocal discontent at such a toothless performance with Weimann’s 89th-minute clincher sparking a mass rush for the exits.

‘We are aiming to be at the top end of the Championship,’ said Holden. ‘Covid has changed the world and part of the message to the players is that when s*** hits the fan, we find solutions to the problems.

‘You might not be able to get together and have social gatherings so we had to find a way to get a spirit going.

‘We saw that today in the performance, we had control of the game. We created chances and were clinical when we got them and I don’t remember Stoke having a chance at our goal.’

O’Neill had spoken about wanting to turn the bet365 Stadium into the kind of forbidding place that used to throw the likes of Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal off their stride. But there was little evidence of that here.

‘In the current climate, it’s hard to gauge home form in an empty stadium,’ he said.

‘We didn’t start the game well, we were slack in possession and not brave enough at times. We lost a really poor goal before half-time and gave ourselves a bit of a mountain to climb.’

That goal by Wells was a superb improvised finish after Chris Martin had knocked down Jack Hunt’s long diagonal into the box. Despite having his back to goal and keeper Adam Davies looming, Wells swivelled and hooked the ball into the top corner.

It was the least the visitors deserved with Weimann, Martin and Hunt also having first-half chances.

Stoke rarely threatened an equaliser after the break and Weimann sealed it from close range after nicking the ball off Danny Batth for Antione Semenyo to tee him up.
