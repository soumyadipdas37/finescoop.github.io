Pierre Gasly has described his shock victory in the Italian Grand Prix as 'unbelievable'.

Lewis Hamilton looked on course to secure another win but he was penalised for entering the pit lane when it was closed.

That enabled Gasly to secure an incredible victory for AlphaTauri as he won a Formula One race for the first time. 

Pierre Gasly has described his shock victory in the Italian Grand Prix as 'unbelievable'

'Honestly, it is unbelievable,' said Gasly, who was dropped by Red Bull last year. 'I cannot believe what is happening right now. It was such a crazy race.

'I have been through so much in the space of 18 months. I struggle to realise this. I have got no words.'

Gasly, who was dropped by Red Bull last year, remarked that he has 'been through so much'

Gasly became the first French winner since Olivier Panis triumphed for Ligier at Monaco 24 years ago. 

24-year-old Gasly was delighted to achieve such a feat. 

He said: 'I always said that is one thing I need to change but I never expected it to happen with Alpha Tauri.'

Carlos Sainz said he was happy to finish in second place despite having a chance of winning

Gasly was closed down by Carlos Sainz of McLaren but managed to fend off the danger. 

Sainz felt that he was a little unfortunate but was still pleased to finish second. 

Sainz added: 'It was a bit unlucky with the Safety Car but we did a good job to recover and I am very happy with second.'
