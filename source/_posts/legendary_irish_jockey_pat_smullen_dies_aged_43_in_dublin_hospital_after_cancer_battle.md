The world of racing was in mourning on Tuesday night after the death of nine-time Irish champion jockey Pat Smullen was announced at the age of 43,

Smullen, who had been battling Pancreatic cancer since March 2018, died in St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.

Smullen, a 12-time European Classic winner, enjoyed a long association with trainer Dermot Weld and their wins together included the 2016 Derby on Harzand.

Smullen was initially given a clean bill of health last year and threw his weight behind organising a racing legends race at the Curragh which raised over â‚¬2.5million for a cancer charity.

However, he suffered a relapse in recent months and his condition deteriorated last week. He leaves behind his wife Frances and their three children Hannah, Paddy and Sarah.
