They have forged a close-knit and wholesome friendship among a sea of feuding woman on The Bachelor.

But even Bella Varelia and Irena Srbinovska's relationship came under strain, as an explosive new trailer shows the best friends coming to blows over leading man, Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert.

A fuming Bella, 25, shockingly tells 31-year-old Irena that she 'doesn't trust her anymore', who in return echoes similar sentiments about their rapidly deteriorating rapport.
