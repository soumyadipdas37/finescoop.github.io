Kelly — who's real name is Richard Colson Baker —  sported a grey T-shirt with floral print pants and white Converse trainers.

He carried his-and-hers pink and black badanas in his hand and swept back his signature platinum blonde hair.

Megan went for an equally casual look with a pair of distressed black jeans, a denim jacket and white-and-black Vans sneakers.
