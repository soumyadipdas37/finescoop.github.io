Candice Brown has reportedly signed up to celebrity dating app Raya, two months after announcing the breakdown of her marriage to Liam Macauley. 

The 2016 Bake Off winner, 35, has created a glamorous profile, with photos linked to her Instagram account on the invite-only dating app, according to The Sun. 

Candice joins a host of stars looking for love on Raya, including the likes of Normal People's Paul Mescal, Alfie Boe, Drew Barrymore and Matthew Perry.

MailOnline has contacted Candice's representatives for comment. 

The brunette beauty alleged venture back into the world of dating comes after her estranged husband Liam's profile was spotted on the dating app Bumble. 

Last month, Liam's profile could be seen on the popular app where women must message men first.

His foray into the world of online dating came just five weeks after he jetted off to Mykonos, Greece with mother-of-one Micah Taffurelli, days after confirming the end of his marriage but has since denied he is in a relationship with her.

On his Bumble profile, the tree-surgeon, 34, said he is 'looking for a relationship and wants children someday', reports The Sun. 

Liam also says that he is a 'great plus one' because he is 'Scottish, 6ft 2ins and has a pug called Dennis'.  

He also added that a non-negotiable factor for him in choosing a partner is that 'you have to like dogs'.

MailOnline contacted representatives of Candice for comment at the time.

Liam told MailOnline last month how his relationship with Candice collapsed under the pressures of fame as the TV cook's career took off after winning Bake Off in 2016. 

Candice's ex told how he had struggled with being thrust into his wife's showbiz world after she won the Channel 4 show and appeared on Dancing On Ice.  

He confirmed he had moved out of the flat they shared with their three dogs Dennis, Albus and Sybil above the gastro pub she runs with her brother, The Green Man in Eversholt, Bedfordshire.

Speaking of their marriage split, he said: 'There is nobody else involved. We have just sadly decided it wasn't working.'

Candice first met Liam in the bar where he worked while studying for a degree, back in 2012.

After five years of dating, the couple announced their engagement in October 2017, just over a year after she first appeared on Bake Off.

Their relationship came under strain just days after becoming engaged when Candice was pictured kissing Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood, 54, on the cheek during a night out.
