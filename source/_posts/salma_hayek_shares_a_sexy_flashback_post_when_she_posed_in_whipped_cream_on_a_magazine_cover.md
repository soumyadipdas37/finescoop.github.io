She turned 54 years young this week and is still every bit the ageless beauty she was when she first came on the scene in Nineties films such as Desperado.

And Salma Hayek continued to reflect back on her earlier years on Thursday when she shared a funny throwback to a magazine shoot she participated in way back in 1996.

It was for Los Angeles Magazine's restaurant issue, and for the cover the Frida star posed in nothing but whipped cream... and 'a cherry on my head'. 

Remember when: Salma Hayek reflected back on her earlier years on Thursday, when she shared a funny and enticing throwback to a magazine shoot she participated in back in 1996

Hayek looked like a confection in the image, as she brought one cream-covered finger to her lips while holding a whisk in her other hand. 

'In August 1996 I was on the cover of Los Angeles Magazine,' the Oscar nominee explained in one slide of the gallery. 

'They were paying homage to Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass album "Whipped Cream & Other Delights" for the Restaurant Issue, so they dressed me up in whipped cream, and even added a cherry on my head.' 

Flawless: Salma turned 54 years young this week and is still every bit the ageless beauty she was when she first came on the scene in Nineties films such as Desperado

In the throwback gallery: Hayek explained that the image was for Los Angeles Magazine's restaurant issue, and for the cover the Frida star posed in nothing but whipped cream

In the next slide, however, Hayek pointed out a glaring omission from the cover of the issue.

'Too bad they didn't even mention my name on the cover...' she wrote, next to another image of herself in the whipped cream getup.

And sure enough, while the cover mentions Julia Child, Mario Puzo and 'The biggest movie ever! Starring Bruce, Sly & Arnold', there is no reference whatsoever to the talented actress who graces the page. 

To mark the occasion of her actual birthday: Salma posed in a glorious yellow swimsuit and skirt combo in front of a seaside view of Greece on her Instagram on Wednesday 

But the day prior, on her actual birthday, there was nothing but positivity and joy on the Fools Rush In star's Instagram.

To mark the occasion, Salma posed in a glorious yellow swimsuit and skirt combo in front of a seaside view of Greece.

'I am very grateful and proud for every single one of my 54 years,' the From Dusk Till Dawn actress wrote in the caption. 

'Thank you for all the birthday wishes, especially to my fans who made a special account for my birthday. What a gift! @salmahappybirthday ✨' 

As for film work: Salma is set to appear in next year's The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, in which she'll reprise her role from 2017's The Hitman's Bodyguard

The fan account to which she referred had prepared its feed to present various tribute to the half-Mexican, half-Lebanese American film star from various fans.

And as for film work, Salma is next slated to appear opposite Angelina Jolie in the net big Marvel Cinematic Universe entry, The Eternals, which is due in theaters next February.
