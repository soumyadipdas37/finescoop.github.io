She was recently revealed as the BBC's new highest paid star following her £1million pay rise. 

And Zoe Ball was keeping up with her fitness regime as she went for a run in Sussex on Sunday morning.

The radio presenter, 49, opted for a laid back look for the outing, sporting a black jumper and a matching pair of knee-length leggings.

The broadcaster also sported a pair of hot pink trainers while she tucked her sunglasses into her jumper. 

Carrying her phone in her hand, Zoe let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders for the day.

The star wore a pair of headphones on her run which was likely near to her new £1.5million Sussex mansion.  

It comes after Zoe was revealed to be the BBC's new top earner, knocking Gary Lineker off the number one spot.

Success: Zoe was recently revealed as the BBC's new highest paid star following her £1million pay rise

The Match of the Day star, 59, is understood to have signed a new five-year contract - and a nearly 25 per cent pay cut from £1.75million down to £1.35million. 

Responding to the news, Gary sarcastically tweeted: 'Oh dear. Thoughts are with the haters at this difficult time.' 

Radio 2 presenter Zoe is now earning £1.36million despite losing nearly a million listeners after the corporation pledged to tackle the gender pay gap.

They have been trying to level up the pay of male and female stars to repair damage to the corporation’s reputation and reduce discord among staff.

Equality issues led to the BBC handing out a settlement to former China editor Carrie Gracie in 2018 and then earlier this year losing an equal pay tribunal case to Samira Ahmed.

Critics have blasted its decision to reward its staff with a total 3.5 per cent salary increase even after it announced plans to slim down its operations following the pandemic.

In July, the BBC announced a huge shake-up of regional TV news and local radio in England which will lead to 450 job cuts.

Changes will see one instead of two presenters fronting 6.30pm regional TV news bulletins as the corporation looks to make £25million in savings.

Other detractors have pointed to the BBC's shocking push to strip 1.5 million pensioners of their free TV licences as the BBC seeks to capture younger audiences in its war with Netflix.

BBC director-general Tim Davie defended Zoe's huge pay rise after she shed nearly a million listeners in the first year in her new role, saying it was a 'punchy' market.

'Zoe is absolutely a broadcaster at the top of her game. She's delivering over eight million listeners,' he boasted. 'I think we're getting incredible value.'

Asked about the likes of Gary Lineker still earning more than £1million, Mr Davie said he would expect 'people to come to the BBC at a significant discount to what they'd get in the open market'. 

But he added: 'We will invest in very limited situations in particular markets to ensure we have got the best talent.'

Gary been the firm's highest-paid firm since 2018 - when Chris Evans, the previous spot-holder, left.

Earlier this month Zoe splashed out an estimated £1.5million on a country mansion built by a Russian aristocrat.

The six-bedroom property, which was created by Baron Vladimir de Wolff in the 1920s, has a swimming pool, tennis court and acres of gardens.

Pay packets made through BBC Studios, the broadcaster's commercial arm and responsible for the likes of Strictly Come Dancing, Antiques Roadshow and Doctor Who, are not disclosed in the new accounts.

The BBC previously opposed the publication of salaries as a 'poacher's charter', but then-boss Lord Hall later said he welcomed the 'transparency'.

The salaries are being published amid questions about how the BBC will be funded in future.

The licence fee model is guaranteed until December 31 2027, the end of the current charter.

Decriminalisation of licence fee evasion could also be on the cards - but the BBC has warned that switching to a civil system would cost the broadcaster more than £200 million a year.

The BBC began means-testing the free TV licence for over-75s in August, having previously delayed its introduction because of the pandemic.

It came as it emerged last night that the BBC had given pay rises to more than 700 female employees since the start of its equal pay scandal.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that at least 84 women were given pay increases through formal processes between July 2017 and March 2020. During the same period, 608 women received a pay revision or increase through an informal pay enquiry.
