Ricky Gervais and his partner Jane Fallon were seen out and about in London on Monday after the author revealed they previously lived in a brothel.

Their outing came shortly after Jane, 59, discussed their living circumstances while trying to make ends meet before becoming famous on Loose Women.

Ricky, also 59, kept things casual while stepping out with his other half, as he wore a long-sleeved polo shirt with a pair of tracksuit bottoms and trainers.

The comedian shielded his eyes from the sun with a pair of shades and sported a smattering of subtle, as he strolled along beside his longterm love. 

Meanwhile, Jane also opted for a low-key look as she wore a pair of gym leggings and a zip-up top, with a second jumper tied around her waist.

She finished the sporty look with a pair of trainers and wore her hair swept back into a bun.

Just a few weeks ago, Jane detailed the couple's lives before Ricky became famous, and spoke about how she feels about going from having no money to being rich.

She said: 'It's kind of weird. Apart from living in a beautiful house, I try to ignore it.

'As long as it gives you pleasure and make use of it, that's fine. But I think to some people it just becomes a prison.'

'As long as it gives you pleasure and make use of it, that's fine. But I think to some people it just becomes a prison.'

She went on: 'We went through a few years when we had absolutely no money. We lived about a brothel. It was horrendous.

'I had many many Saturday jobs. I worked in a book shop, but all sorts of different shops. I was a chambermaid in various hotels. I loved that job. It was quiet, you were on your own.'

The comedian achieved mainstream fame the following year with his BBC television mock documentary series, The Office in 2001.

Jane, who was promoting her new book Queen Bee, also detailed what lockdown life has been like for her and Ricky, as she admitted to finding it difficult with the comedian being around so much. 

'He's like a Fisher Price toy, making random noises all over the place,' she claimed.

'I need complete silence when I work. It's hard when the two of us are at home. I have to take myself into another room.' 

The couple have been together since 1982 but previously told The Times they decided not to marry because 'there's no point in us having an actual ceremony before the eyes of God because there is no God'.

Ricky added they decided not to have children because 'we didn't fancy dedicating 16 years of our lives. And there are too many children, of course'.  

Earlier this year, Ricky revealed the third series of After Life will be the last of the hit Netflix sitcom.  

Two series of the dark comedy have been released so far, both to widespread acclaim from critics and viewers.

But earlier this year Ricky told The Mirror: 'I've already made my mind up there won't be a fourth series.  

'And you do put those things out there to make you remember as it's tempting but... there's an old saying that "to lead the orchestra, you've got to turn your back on the audience".

'That's true. The audience think they want another one, but they're not sure. So you've got to be careful.'
