Barcelona have decided not to pursue their interest in signing Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez.

The Argentinian striker has been strongly linked with a move to the Camp Nou this year and is valued at around £90million by the San Siro club. 

However, given the financial uncertainty at Barcelona, the Catalans have been unable to meet Inter’s asking price and have subsequently withdrawn from the transfer race. 

Barcelona have decided to give up on signing £90million Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez

Despite pulling out of a deal with Inter, Barca will continue to look to fill the void left by Luis Suarez - who completed a £5.5m to Diego Simeone's side after being told by Ronald Koeman he was no longer required at the Camp Nou. 

Martinez would have been an ideal replacement for Suarez, having scored 14 goals in Serie A last season.

Although Barca will still look to replace Luis Suarez, who was sold to Atletico Madrid for £5.5m

If Barca boss Ronald Koeman signed Martinez he would not have the funds to purchase others

Barcelona knew that if they met Inter's asking price, they wouldn't be able to strengthen in other areas prior to the deadline of October 5. 

Ideally, Koeman would like to add depth at centre-back and right-back before the summer window closes. 

Martinez did have a £101m release clause in his contract but that option expired in July.

Inter are now asking for a minimum of £73m for their striker and will refuse to accept additional players as part of the deal, according to Calciomercato.

Given Martinez's move to Barca is now off the table, he is likely to agree news terms at Inter 

As a move to Spain is now off the table, Martinez looks set to stay at the San Siro for another season. 

Martinez's contract is due to expire in 2023, but it seems likely that the striker will agree new terms with the club.

While Barca have been linked with Lyon forward Memphis Depay, who Ronald Koeman managed at international level, as an alternative option for their forward line.
