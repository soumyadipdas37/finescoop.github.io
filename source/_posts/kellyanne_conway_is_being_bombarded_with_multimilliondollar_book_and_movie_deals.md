Jerry Oppenheimer is a New York Times bestselling author and two of his thirteen books have been bestselling, headline-making biographies of the Kennedy family – The Other Mrs. Kennedy, and RFK Jr. and the Dark Side of the Dream. 

Within a day of Kellyanne Conway's surprise decision to leave the White House, the outspoken blonde once called 'The True First Lady of Trump's America,' was being bombarded with multimillion-dollar book and movie offers, according to insiders.

The heads of the major book publishers were preparing what insiders say will be the biggest advance ever for a Trump tell-all – 'well over $15 million,' and Hollywood producers are 'going to war for the film rights,' revealed a high-powered insider.

A top New York publishing source says, 'Millions are on the table for Kellyanne - at least $15 million and maybe more -- because her story has it all.

'There's her powerful insider status as ultra loyal counselor to America's most controversial president – his chief political advisor, and how her position tore apart the fabric of her family life, and why she's leaving one of the most powerful inner-circle political positions to mend it with her husband and rebel daughter. It's blockbuster material!'

Conway confirmed the news of her departure from the White House on Twitter, saying she was leaving 'gratefully & humbly' last week and it didn't take long for the cash offers to start rolling in 

Conoway praised Donald Trump as a champion of women in her speech to the Republican National Committee on Wednesday 

If Kellyanne inks a deal worth close to $15million it will be considerably more than other Trump players who have cash in their chips. James Comey got a reported $2million advance for his book - John Bolton the same. Trump's predecessors fared better with Barack Obama getting an astounding $65 million.

Kellyanne's story, as a leading New York and Washington, D.C. literary agent who has handled many of the big political books told DailyMail.com, 'is one for the masses – Republican or Democrat, man or woman. Everyone can relate to how a down-to-earth woman with immense power fights to save her family life. It's a once in a lifetime story and book deal, with immense big-screen potential.'

And a top Hollywood producer declares, 'The Kellyanne story is a ready-made-for-the-screen reality show. It has all the elements – powerful loyal Trump wife vs. powerful Trump-hating husband, and woke teenage daughter who wants a divorce from her broken politicized family who goes on social media to denounce them both. It's the box office smash we've been waiting for. Just like Kellyanne said in her resignation, the film's title is already engraved – ''Less Drama, More mama.'''

According to that source, movie rights 'will be worth millions more to Kellyanne on top of the millions she gets from the publishing world, so all told, along with other affiliated rights, she should could easily cash-in with close to $50million. Talk about a golden parachute!!!'

As one of President Trump's most visible, outspoken and longest-serving advisors, Kellyanne, who will be 54-years-old next November when she hopes to see President Trump elected for a second term, made her surprise announcement on Twitter on the eve of the start of the Republican National Convention, stating that she was stepping away from her White House role to spend more time with her family – husband and four teenage children.

'This is completely my choice and my voice,' she told millions of Twitter followers, and the media. 'In time I will announce future plans. For now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.'

She added that she and her husband 'disagree about plenty but we are united on what matters most: the kids.'

In an interview last week with Fox News's Martha MacCallum prior to Kellyanne's speech at the Republican National Convention, the just-resigned presidential counselor declined to say what her future career plans are - and wasn't asked whether a book deal might be in the works.

'I will announce my plans in the future,' was all she would say. Instead, she noted, 'I have to invest in leisure wear and hover over my kids as they hover over their computers during school from home.'

And she credited her career success to Donald Trump, calling her inner-circle job a 'blessing not a burden,' a job she noted she started when she had just turned 50-years-old. 

'Just like Kellyanne said in her resignation, the film's title is already engraved – ''Less Drama, More mama''' a top Hollywood producer said due to the fact that her daughter Claudia has been outspoken against her mother and Trump 

Conway's family has come into the spotlight as both her 15-year-old daughter Claudia and husband George (pictured) are vocal anti-Trump advocates 

Her husband George also confirmed the news of his stepping back from his high-profile role running the anti-Trump group

In her formal resignation, she said, 'Our four children are teens and tweens starting a new academic year, in middle school and high school, remotely at home for at least a few months.

'As millions of parents nationwide know, kids ''doing school from home'' requires a level of attention and vigilance that is as unusual as these times.'

Meanwhile, her future plans may already be set in stone, as it didn't take very long after her announcement shot across social media for the publishing and movie worlds to come knocking.

Conway is a veteran in publishing, having co-written a book in 2005 about 'the ways in which women are reshaping American society and paving new ground for future trends'

'Kellyanne's being literally barraged with piles of money to tell her story in print and on the big and streaming screens,' a Conway family insider told DailyMail.com. 'It's going to be pro-Trump all the way, but her insider stories of life working beside the president will make all those other so-called Trump tell-all books, most of them pure fiction, look pale by comparison.'

Conway would join a tall list of former Trump employees who have made a hefty check from writing about their time with the president, including former FBI director James Comey, National Security Advisor John Bolton and personal fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen. 

With the proposed blockbuster book on the horizon, it would not be Kellyanne's first publishing effort.

In October 2005, a decade before she joined the Trump White House, she co-authored a well-received book entitled, 'What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Line to Change the Way We Live.'

The 336-page book, which had an advertised 40,000 first printing, evaluated, 'the ways in which women are reshaping American society and paving new ground for future trends, revealing how an increasing number of women are choosing to remain unmarried, work in non-traditional jobs, and have children later in life.'

Considered a staunch republican, Kelleyanne's co-author was described as a Democratic Party strategist.

A dozen years later, when she was at work with President Trump, a Kindle book was published by a comedian entitled, 'The Kellyanne Conway Technique: Perfecting the Ancient Art of Delivering Half-Truths, Fake News, and Obfuscation – With a Smile.'

Meanwhile, Kellyanne's non-traditional role as counselor to President Trump publicly tore her family apart, according to accounts.

Her husband, George T. Conway III, a prominent conservative lawyer, became an avowed and outspoken Trump critic, causing what sources assert was much friction within the family, especially with their children.

But along with Kellyanne's announcement last Sunday, her hubby announced on Twitter that he had decided to separate from advising the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, and also take time away from his Twitter account where he regularly critiqued Trump and members of the president's team.

Claudia took to TikTok to tell her followers about her family problems and speak out against her mother's job  







Claudia, who has previously called Trump 'a f**king idiot' and asked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to 'adopt her', has become an outspoken critic of the president and her mother's role in the administration on social media, which Hollywood producers say it perfect drama for the big screen

The political friction in the Conway family, however, was made widely public on Tik Tok and other social media by Kellyanne and George's woke, left-leaning pretty daughter, 15-year-old Claudia Conway, with 600,000 social media followers. She has described herself as a 'radical agnostic liberal/leftist.'

And even though her mother and father are now trying to build bridges with the Conway children, Claudia, who earlier was 'officially pushing for emancipation,' continued her Tik Tok rants, claiming her parents, 'didn't even talk about it with any of us…they just tweeted about it as if this is going to change anything and make me not emancipate myself.'

In her emancipation proclamation, which she tweeted a day before her mother and father's announcements, Claudia declared, 'Buckle up because this is probably going to be public one way or another, unfortunately. Welcome to my life…'

But, she, too, said she was planning to take a break from her constant Tik Tok postings and focus on her emotional well-being.

'Words are not enough to express my love for my following. You are all amazing,' the teen Trump-trasher declared. 'Thank you for the support and love. May you feel my love and peace back. I am taking a break to process the recent news and to stabilize my mental health.'

The Conways and Trump have been friends for many years, a friendship that began long before his presidential run, back when he was still a real estate developer, and when Kellyanne was a pollster and political consultant and pundit.

For some seven years in the early 2000s, the New Jersey native, the daughter of a trucking company owner who abandoned the family when she was just a child, lived in Trump World Tower, and conducted private polls for him when he considered running for New York governor in 2013.

Sources say heads of major book publishers were preparing what insiders say will be the biggest advance ever for a Trump tell-all

Hollywood producers are 'going to war for the film rights,' revealed a high-powered insider, as they estimate she could make $50million from deals

She served as Trump's last campaign manager during his first successful run for the presidency, and has been one of his fiercest defenders in the media, often appearing on the Fox News Channel and sparring with hosts on Trump's despised CNN.

In late 2019, an opinion writer for The New York Times wrote a column, asking, 'Can this Twitter marriage be saved? With the headline, 'Why We Can't Stop Watching the George and Kellyanne Conway Show.'

But that's exactly what has the publishing world and Hollywood so all-a-twitter that they are going to be pushing millions of dollars at her.

As a renowned publishing house executive told DailyMail.com, 'Until Donald Trump pens his memoir, Kellyanne Conway's book will be THE Bible of the Trump presidency, that's the way we see it and it will be worth every million we spend to acquire it!'

Kellyanne Conway is set up to make millions off lucrative book deals if she decides to write a tell-all on her time as Donald Trump's confidant. 

She joins a tall list of former Trump employees who have made a hefty check from writing about their time with the president, including former FBI director James Comey, National Security Advisor John Bolton and personal fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen.

Some of the first Trump books from early on in his presidency came from journalists, beginning with Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury and Bob Woodward's Fear, which sold more than two million copies. 



Then in trickled the disgruntled former employees who were either fired or resigned and signed deals to tell their personal experiences in the White House.  

White House Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, who served for just 11 days released Trump: The Blue Collar President and Omarosa Manigault Newman, former assistant to the president, wrote Unhinged. 

John Bolton's book titled The Room Where It Happened, has sold more than a million copies since it was released this summer. 

Bolton was reportedly paid a $2million advance for his book.  

Meanwhile, the best-selling of all Trump books so far comes from none other than family - his niece Mary L. Trump. 



She has written Too Mich and Never Enough: How My Family Created The World's Most Dangerous Man.   

The book reflects its title and gives a harsh critique of President Trump. Her book has sold over $1.3million copies and has gone into its 20th printing. 

James Comey, former F.B.I. director, reportedly was paid a $2million advance for his book A Higher Loyalty.  

First Lady Melania has not escaped the scrutiny either, as her former friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff has now written a book titled Melania and Me.  

In it, she tells how Melania laughed during the 2016 campaign after the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape came out and revealed Donald Trump saying he liked to grab women 'by the p****.' 

Still to come is the president's former personal fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen's book, Disloyal, which will hit shelves on September 8. 

The New York Times reported that in the last four years, there have been more than 1,200 titles about Donald Trump, compared to around 500 books about President Barack Obama and his administration during his first term, according to an analysis by NPD BookScan.
