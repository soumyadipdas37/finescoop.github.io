Australian homewares retailer Adairs has collaborated with a mother-daughter artist duo for its latest range of quilts, sheets and lamp shades - and the stunning buys are already flying off shelves. 

Lauren Jarrett and Melissa Greenwood, who create art under the name Miimi and Jiinda, have produced a series of bright and bold pattern sets for the luxury store that pay homage to their Aboriginal roots.

The signature hallmarks of their distinctive designs are expressed in the $199.99 organic cotton bedlinen, $39.99 eucalyptus and bergamot candle, $199.99 printed table lights, $29.99 makeup bag and $19.99 lunchbox.

'When the opportunity came up to collaborate with Adairs, we immediately said yes. We have personally always been big fans of the brand and their quality products,' Melissa said.

'As our business expands, we feel collaborations of this nature are the perfect way to share our story and culture while showcasing our art to the wider population.'

Each of the designs in this collection is inspired by the Gumbayngirr land they live on and the stories passed down through generations.
