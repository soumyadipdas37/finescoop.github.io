A former footballer killed a 'devoted' married couple after his truck was involved in a crash on the M56, a court has heard.

Ex-Barnsley FC striker Steven Bennett admitted his careless driving caused the deaths of Richard and Angela Wong after he was involved in the multi-vehicle accident last September. 

Mrs Wong, 56, was pronounced dead at the scene near Warrington and Mr Wong, 62, died in hospital three days later. 

Five others suffered minor injuries in the crash. 

Bennett, 28, appeared at Chester Crown Court on Friday where he denied two charges of causing death by dangerous driving in connection with the incident.

However, he admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving.

The former footballer, who made a handful of first team appearances for Barnsley FC during their 2010/11 Championship season, will stand trial in August next year.

Mr and Mrs Wong's son and daughter paid tribute to the 'devoted' couple in the wake of their deaths last year.

In a statement, their children said: 'Angela and Richard were loving parents and grandparents, as well as a loving brother and sister.

'They were a devoted couple who had been married for 37 years and were well loved by all those who were fortunate to have known them - they touched the hearts and enriched the lives of everyone who knew them.

'Our parents leave behind two children, two grandchildren and an extensive family and group of friends who are all devastated by their sudden loss - they will be truly missed by everyone who knew them.

'We are forever grateful to have had them as our wonderful parents - we love them very much and they will be forever in our hearts.'

The M56 near Warrington, Lancashire, remained shut for 12 hours following the incident at 5:30pm before reopening at around 5am the next day.
