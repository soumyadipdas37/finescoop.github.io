Luna Atkins (pictured) had been at home only hours when she died in the bedroom tragedy. An inquest heard her parents Philippa Atkins, 34, and James Atkins, 35, had a 'celebratory glass of prosecco before retiring to bed'

A three-day-old baby died after her parents fell asleep while she was being breastfed by her mother in bed, an inquest heard.

Luna Atkins had been at home for only a few hours when she died in the tragic bedroom incident. Parents Philippa Atkins, 34, and James Atkins, 35, had a 'celebratory glass of prosecco before retiring to bed'.

Recruitment company worker Mrs Atkins began breastfeeding Luna at around 9.30pm but both exhausted parents fell asleep.

But her mother woke four hours later to discover Luna was 'unresponsive' and was declared dead by paramedics 50 minutes later.

Luna was born two weeks premature on May 9 at 37 weeks by emergency Cesarean section.Â 

She was discharged from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff two days later around 5pm after doctors decided she was strong enough to return home with her parents.

A statement from police given to the inquest said: 'Luna was breastfed at around 9.30pm. Both parents fell asleep while she was feeding.

'Mum woke at around 1.30am on May 12 to find Luna unresponsive. CPR was commenced by family and paramedics who attended.'

Luna was declared dead at around 2.20am at their home in Roath, Cardiff.

Parents Philippa Atkins, 34, and James Atkins, 35 (pictured together on their wedding day), had a 'celebratory glass of prosecco before retiring to bed', an inquest heard.

A post-mortem examination was carried out but the cause of death was recorded as 'unascertained'.

At the short hearing in Pontypridd, coroner Graeme Hughes said: 'It remains for me to pass on my own condolences to Luna's family'.

A final hearing is scheduled to take place on July 27 next year at 10am.

Heartbroken mother Mrs Atkins is now fundraising to help other children - and described Luna as 'our beautiful baby' and 'our perfect little girl.'

She said: 'Luna has taught me life is too short and too precious! We owe it to her to fill the world with more music and more joy.

'So if you ever think you can't, look up at the moon, and my baby will show you that the world is good and you are loved!

Keen runner Mrs Atkins is now planning a half marathon in honour of Luna and other children by raising money for the Martha's Dancing Heart appeal to raise money for the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust

'I got to carry Luna for 9 months, and hold her for nearly 3 days. I knew my daughter and she was good! She has given me the strength to believe in myself and strive to make the world a better place.

'Whatever you have been through, I am always here for you as you are there for me. As things start to go back to 'normal' let's strive to make it better.

'Let's laugh more and sing more. Let's never forget the tragedies of the last few months, and let's remember those we have lost in the best possible way.'
