Channel Seven star Larry Emdur and his wife Sylvie have quietly put their two Bondi investment properties on the market.      

Despite the COVID-19 recession having an impact on the Sydney housing market, The Morning Show host, 55, decided to list the properties on the back of his real estate agent son's recent success in the suburb. 

Jay Edmur set a building record with the $1.36 million sale of a two-bedroom apartment located on Ramsgate Avenue in North Bondi, and now he is hoping to do the same for his father.

'[Larry's] had Bondi investments for 30 years and he’s looking to do other investments down the track rather than one-bedroom or two-bedroom units,' Jye told Realestate.com.au.

'So we’ve got them on the database and we’ve got some who missed out on Ramsgate Avenue looking, and a few others have been through.'

The first property listed is a one bedroom apartment located on Brighton Boulevard.

Back in February, Larry and wife shelled out $1.1 million for a holiday home in Berowra Waters, New South Wales.

They purchased the luxurious property as a getaway from their current home in upscale Bondi. 

'The magical bay is much quieter than Bondi,' Larry told The Daily Telegraph this Sunday.

The property is only accessible via a boat, and boasts sweeping views across the river and national park.  

It features two large bedrooms, with the main featuring a full bathroom, walk-in robe and a large balcony, along with a large open plan living area. 

Larry and Sylvie have amassed a large property portfolio around Sydney in recent years.

They sold his impressive Dover Heights clifftop mansion for $11.5 million to celebrity Anthony Bell in November, 2017.

In June of that year, the pair nabbed a $3.09 million three-bedroom apartment in The Rocks.

The couple shelled out a further $1.08 million for a three-bedroom, one bathroom unit in affluent Bellevue Hill, earlier this year. 

Plenty of room! The home offers a lot of space with spacious, light-filled living areas and a gourmet kitchen
