Britain's Got Talent judges Alesha Dixon and David Walliams are left awestruck as contestant Belinda Davids blows them away with a stunning rendition of Whitney Houston's track I Have Nothing. 

In an exclusive clip of the ITV talent show, which is set to air on Saturday night, Alesha, 41, and David, 49, are visibly mesmerised as the South African singer belts out the ballad.

Dressed to impress in a sparkly red dress, single mum Belinda is in it to win it as she gives it her all during the next round of semi final performances.

While Alesha, who wowed in a ruffled black number, could barely take her eyes off Belinda.

The performance, which featured BGT guest judge Ashley Banjo, has now become the second-most complained about television moment of the decade, but a spokesperson for the government-approved regulatory body has confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken.

The representative said: 'We carefully considered a large number of complaints about this artistic routine, an area where freedom of expression is particularly important.

'Diversity's performance referred to challenging and potentially controversial subjects, and in our view, its central message was a call for social cohesion and unity.

'Any depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation – but rather a message that the lives of black people matter.'

Troupe leader Ashley reacted to the news on Instagram as he shared the statement and penned: 'Creativity is always a leap of faith. All I did what was what felt right and I'd do it 100 times over... Sending love to everyone that stood by us'.

The routine, which narrated the death of black man George Floyd beneath the knee of a white police officer, divided fans after it aired during the live show.
