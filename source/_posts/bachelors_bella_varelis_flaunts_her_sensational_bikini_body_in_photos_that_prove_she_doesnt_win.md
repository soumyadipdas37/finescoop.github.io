She's meant to be keeping a low profile ahead of The Bachelor finale that airs this week. 

But on Wednesday, villain and finalist Bella Varelis once again disregarded the unspoken rule as she enjoyed a beach session with co-star Bec Cvilikas in Sydney. 

The 25-year-old marketing consultant showcased her incredible figure in a bronze bikini as she soaked up the sun at Balmoral Beach - an outing that all but confirms she doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart on the show.

Cheeky! The girls made sure to put their best assets on display

Last week, the girls were spotted enjoying a day out at Sydney's Bondi Beach, after having moved in together. 

The outings all but prove that neither Bella or Bec win Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor Australia.

Bachelor finalists are encouraged to keep a low profile while their season airs, but they chose to top up their tans at paparazzi hotspots.

And they made no effort to hide their friendship on both occasions. 

Fans are convinced that Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler.

Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale.

However, it's important to note that some former Bachelor winners have remained friends with their co-stars.

Favourites: As of Tuesday, Irena is the bookies' favourite to win ($1.27), Bella is tipped for runner-up ($3.50) and intruder Bec is expected to place third ($7.50)

Meanwhile, after arriving into The Bachelor mansion as Locky's 'angel', Bella has quickly turned into the villain on the show.

Fans turned on the brunette on Wednesday night after she accused her former best friend Irena Srbinovska of 'lying'.

The marketing consultant told the other women, Irena, 31, has 'manipulated her way through the show'.

As of Tuesday, Irena is the bookies' favourite to win ($1.27), Bella is tipped for runner-up ($3.50) and intruder Bec is expected to place third ($7.50). 

The Bachelor finale begins Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
