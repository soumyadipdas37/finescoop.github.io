Has the winner of The Masked Singer Australia been leaked just five days before the grand finale?

The latest betting odds from Sportsbet suggest that someone involved in the production has let slip the result.

The last episode was secretly filmed in Melbourne and Sydney on Tuesday night, and the current odds point to a clear winner.

As of Wednesday morning, the Queen is the favourite with odds of just $1.30.

The Bushranger is tipped for second place ($4) and Frillneck is most likely to place third in the competition ($7.50).

The Queen's extremely short odds suggest some degree of insider knowledge that she wins the celebrity guessing game.

It's possible an insider leaked the result overnight, causing a surge in bets that resulted in the Queen's odds being slashed significantly.

The majority of viewers are convinced that the Queen is singer Kate Miller-Heidke.

This is because the cryptic clues align with Kate's career and personal life, and The Queen's powerful voice matches that of the classically trained songstress.

Evidence: Tellingly, one particular clue ('I'm 13 times a bridesmaid but never a bride') matches how many times Kate has been nominated for an ARIA award without winning 

Makes sense! Another hint about the Queen's desire to 'rule the world' seemingly alludes to her performance at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019

Tellingly, one particular clue ('I'm 13 times a bridesmaid but never a bride') matches how many times Kate has been nominated for an ARIA award without winning.

Another hint about the Queen's desire to 'rule the world' seemingly alludes to her performance at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019.

The Bushranger is believed to be either Jessica Mauboy or Bonnie Anderson.

Singer and actress Bonnie was briefly 'outed' as the Bushranger on her Wikipedia page last week, but the rogue edit was swiftly deleted.

The Masked Singer's grand finale was filmed under strict lockdown conditions on Tuesday night.

Host Osher Günsberg, and judge Jackie 'O' Henderson filmed their segments from a Channel 10 studio in Sydney, while fellow panellists Dave Hughes and Dannii Minogue remained in Melbourne, according to TV Blackbox.

The fourth panellist, Urzila Carlson, is believed to have Zoomed in from New Zealand.

Production at Melbourne's Dockland Studios had been suspended last month after COVID-19 outbreak on set, and the entire cast and crew went into self-isolation.

Channel 10 and Warner Bros. allowed Osher, Jackie and Urzila to return home after two-week quarantine period on compassionate grounds, hence why they filmed their segments remotely.

Jackie revealed on her KIIS FM breakfast show on Wednesday morning that filming had wrapped at about 3am and she hadn't slept.

The finale of The Masked Singer will air Monday, September 14 on Channel 10
