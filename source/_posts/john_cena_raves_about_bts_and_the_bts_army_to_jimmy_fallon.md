'When something becomes a thing, it's open for criticism,' Cena began. 'I love what this band has done, because they're this massively popular thing and they've been so globally popular for so long, I was like, "OK, I should really know about this.'

Cena added he was 'originally drawn' to the group because, 'there are rappers in that crew and they use, on some of their intro tracks and bookend tracks, these sick a** boom bap beats and they actually rap.'

He added that he was initially interested in the music itself, but then he became interested, 'in what the music stood for' since they advocate 'self-love' and not being afraid of failure.

Cena said the group is trying to 'shatter all the stereotypical difficulties and uncomfortable situations we all go through, and they're catering to an audience that is living that, young people.'

He added that their fans, known as the BTS Army, have stepped up in other ways, including after the group donated $1 million to Black Lives Matter.

'They were like, if they can do it, we can do it. Fans, who were already coming out of the pocket to support artists, came out of pocket more to support charity, and this isn't the first time they've done this,' Cena said.

Cena added that the group 'resonating enough through the television' to get fans to give back to a worth cause is, 'work, that's purpose, that's f***ing changing the world. That's impressive.'

He added that even if you don't like BTS' music, 'how they conduct themselves as human beings and the message they send to the world, that's something special.'

BTS also performed in their second night of BTS Week on Fallon, performing the song Home from album Map of the Soul.
