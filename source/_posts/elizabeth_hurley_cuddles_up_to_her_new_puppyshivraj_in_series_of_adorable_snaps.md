She has just adopted a new Labrador puppy named Shivraj.

And Elizabeth Hurley was delighted to show off the recent addition to her family on Monday, as she shared a series of sweet snaps to her Instagram page.

The model, 55, couldn't contain her glee as he cradled her young pooch, before holding the puppy up in the air before trying to plant a kiss on him.

The mother-of-one cut a glamorous figure in a pretty purple blouse, which boasted puff sleeves and cold-shoulder detailing.

She enhanced her striking features with a full coat of make-up, including a subtle smokey-eye with winged liner and a slick of lip gloss.

Elizabeth held the pup in her perfectly manicured hands, and simply captioned the image: 'Puppy love!'

On Sunday, her son Damian Hurley suggested their beloved dog Ava no longer commands his unwavering attention after showing off the new puppy.| 

He gave the unnamed dog its social media debut by sharing three separate posts, among them a short video, with his Instagram followers.   

Damian, 18, was seen grinning uncontrollably while cradling the puppy as he walks shirtless through a large open field.

The teenager also offers fans a close up of the dog's face, while a brief clip captures Damian's pooch as it attempts to leap through the tall grass. 

Collectively captioning the updates, he wrote: 'Puppy heaven!' 

No stranger to giving followers a insight into his home life, the young model frequently shares snaps of family dog Ava being showered with affection. 

The floppy-eared pet had been a regular fixture on his Instagram account as he isolated at home with mum Liz at their Herefordshire estate during the UK's nationwide lockdown.

Damian's latest posts come after details of his late father Steve Bing's will emerged, among them the claim that he had disinherited his two children, Damian and Kira Kerkorian, due to it being drawn up before their births.

The multi-millionaire committed suicide aged 55 in June, jumping from his 27th floor apartment in Los Angeles.

Steve, who received a $600million inheritance from his grandfather when he turned 18, had his will drawn up in 2001 - before he knew Kira had been born and while Elizabeth was pregnant.

Kira, 21, his daughter with former tennis star Lisa Bonder, is said to be fighting for control of his estate that was valued at just $337,000, according to documents obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com.

Although Bing notes Elizabeth was expecting a child, he declares in his will: 'Whether or not such child is mine, it is my intention not to provide in this Will for such child (or any other child as to which I may be the father) in this Will or for the offspring of any such child or children, whether now living or hereafter born.' 

Bing later formed relationships with both Damian and Kira, even fighting for them to be included in their grandfather's trust last year.

Prior to his death, Bing had an estimated net worth of $590 million, according to various reports. While his estate was valued at $337,000 - his properties were not included in that evaluation.

Last year, Steve's father Peter Bing had tried to block Kira and Damian from being beneficiaries of his trust, claiming they were love children and should be excluded.

Steve jumped into the legal battle for his children and successfully fought the case, ensuring Damian and Kira would be beneficiaries.

In a tribute posted on Instagram about Steve's death, Damian's mother Elizabeth Hurley revealed that she had been rebuilding her friendship with Bing over the past year.

'I am saddened beyond belief that my ex Steve is no longer with us. It is a terrible end,' she wrote.

'Our time together was happy and I'm posting these pictures because although we went through some tough times, it's the good, wonderful memories of a sweet, kind man that matter.

'In the past year we had become close again. We last spoke on our son's 18th birthday. This is devastating news and I thank everyone for their lovely messages.'
