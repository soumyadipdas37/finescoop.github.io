I had one caller on BBC 5 Live on Saturday night bashing Paul Pogba, and another saying Harry Maguire must go and that Manchester United should sign Virgil van Dijk! 

It’s all doom and gloom right now, but it’s funny how a signing or two can change the mood at a club.

Look at Tottenham and Jose Mourinho. This time last week you’d think the end of the world was near after their 1-0 home loss against Everton.

Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon's arrivals have lifted the negative mood around Tottenham

Now, they’ve signed Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid, beaten Southampton 5-2, Harry Kane has shown his versatility and suddenly there’s a buzz! Chelsea fans are ecstatic about their spending, though unhappy about Sunday's game. 

At Arsenal, they’re relieved Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has signed a new deal. 

At United, however, spirits seem low. They had a flat pre-season then faced a stubborn Crystal Palace and lost. 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer dropped Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Mason Greenwood to the bench when fans want them to start. 

But it’s too early to write off United’s season. The window is still open, and a lot can happen in a week.
