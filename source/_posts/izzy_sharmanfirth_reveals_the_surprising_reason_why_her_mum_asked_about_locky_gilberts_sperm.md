Bachelor viewers were left stunned after Izzy Sharman-Firth's mother asked Locky Gilbert for his sperm during Wednesday's episode.   

But on Thursday, the 29-year-old, who was eliminated later that episode, revealed why her mother asked the hunky 31-year-old to donate his sperm. 

In an interview with News.com.au, the reality star explained that her mum made the crude comment in jest.

'Mum’s a bit of a wildcard,' Izzy admitted to the publication. 

'She told me she meant it in jest, and I think she was a bit self-conscious because it came across as though she wasn’t joking.' 

Izzy added: 'I definitely don’t want Locky’s sperm … Mum just has a very dry sense of humour.'

'We just wondered... This is probably a little, tiny bit out there, but, you know, I've always said to Isabella, if she doesn't really find a man and she feels like a baby, is there any chance, as a consolation prize, just a little bit of sperm...' Izzy's mum (pictured) asked

The then hopeful, Izzy had taken Locky home to meet her two mums, when one of the women decided to ask the former Survivor star to donate his sperm. 

'We just wondered... This is probably a little, tiny bit out there, but, you know, I've always said to Isabella, if she doesn't really find a man and she feels like a baby, is there any chance, as a consolation prize, just a little bit of sperm...' she asked.

Fans had plenty to say about the outrageous interaction, which left Locky momentarily dumbfounded.

'If Izzy wants to know where it all went horribly wrong, perhaps go back to the moment where mum brokered Locky's sperm as a potential consolation prize,' tweeted one viewer.

'Izzy, will you accept this sperm?' wrote one person, while another shocked viewer wrote, 'These two women didn't come to play... they are in a sperm hunt'.

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
