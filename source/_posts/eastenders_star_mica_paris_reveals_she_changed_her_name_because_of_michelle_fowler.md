However there have been tough times as well. In 2001 her brother was shot dead after his girlfriend rejected his killer’s advances.

In July, Mica revealed how she was 'overwhelmed with sadness' and broke down crying after visiting a tiny cellar once used to hide slaves who were on the run.

The singer went to the Slave Haven Underground Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, while filming her BBC documentary, The Gospel According To Mica. 

She explained how being at the emotional location made her feel 'angry' and reflect on the racism her ancestors had suffered.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Mica said: 'Afterwards, I felt overwhelmed with intense sadness and anger. I couldn't help but cry.'

Mica added: 'It did make me ­angry. It made me realise what my ancestors had gone through and the racism they suffered and how it was no different for me.

'It's like a Jewish person going to visit Auschwitz. It was no different at all.'
