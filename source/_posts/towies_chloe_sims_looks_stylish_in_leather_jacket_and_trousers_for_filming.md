The stars, who have been close friends for years, had a falling out eight months ago with Chloe telling Pete she no longer wanted him in her life.

On Sunday night's episode, Chloe had a socially distanced gathering with Olivia Attwood, James 'Diags' Bennewith and Liam 'Gatsby' Blackwell and opened up about their argument.  

Speaking about lockdown, she said: 'It's a terrible thing for a lot of people but there has been some positives. 

Confident: Ella commanded attention in her yellow and red patterned top and stylish blue jeans 

Casual: Nicole Bass joined the others as she took her dog for a walk in the park wearing a black sports bra and baggy green trousers

Drama: Nicole's outing comes after she was spotted having a heated row with co-star Amber Turner last week

'It brought the families closer together and it’s actually showed me who’s important in my life. "Best friends" who didn’t really give a s**t. 

'Me and Pete stopped speaking. We had a falling out since the end of January. It wasn’t nasty, it was quite calm but I didn’t want to have people around me who aren’t 100pc. I just said, "I can’t have you in my life anymore."'

Chloe did not elaborate on what the argument was about or why she had decided to stop speaking to Pete, 31.

Olivia said: 'I'm surprised he didn’t reach out to you during lockdown. He’d normally check in, especially on you, but there you go.'

Chloe replied: 'He made me question if I even knew him at all.'

Later in the episode, Olivia met with Pete and took the opportunity to hear his side of the story.  

Recalling their falling out, Pete said: 'We had a barney and the last thing she said to me was we didn’t need to talk so so be it.  

Cut off: The TOWIE stars, who have been close friends for years, had a falling out eight months ago with Chloe telling Pete she no longer wanted him in her life 

'We’ve been close for so many years and this was the first time we’ve disagreed and I’ve thought, "you know what she doesn’t want me in her life." It’s the longest we’ve ever gone without talking.'

Pete admitted he would like to patch things up with Chloe but he worries that their friendship is now beyond repair.  

He said: 'What does worry me, if I do reach out to her and she says f**k off, it’ll hurt me. Do I want to save the friendship? Of course I do. Do I think it can be saved? No.' 

TOWIE airs on Sundays at 9pm on ITVBe.
