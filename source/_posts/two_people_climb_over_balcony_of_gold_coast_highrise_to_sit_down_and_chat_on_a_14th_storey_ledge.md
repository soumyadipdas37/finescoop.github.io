A couple have bizarrely climbed over a 14th floor balcony on the Gold Coast to sit on the ledge of the building and have a chat.

The pair made the dangerous move on Sunday morning at the Wyndham Hotel in Surfers Paradise.

Terrified onlookers saw the pair climb the balcony and sit themselves up on the ledge.

They then remained on the ledge where it looked like they were having a chat, 7NEWS reported. 

Thinking the worst, witnesses called police but by the time they arrived the two people had disappeared.

It is not yet known whether the pair were paid guests of the hotel or if it is being used as a mandatory hotel quarantine location. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Queensland Police and the Wyndham Hotel for comment.  

Queensland recorded four coronavirus cases on Sunday and health officials are desperately warning three million people to be on high alert.

Three of the new cases are from a Forest Lake home in south-west Brisbane and the other is from Ipswich.  

Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young urged residents with symptoms to get tested, especially those in South East Queensland.

More than 3.5 million people live in the region, which stretches across the east coast and covers Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast.

'They might have been where one of our cases has been,' she said.

'Anyone who lives in that southeast corner should think of themselves as a casual contact.'

A casual contact is someone who has had brief face-to-face contact or been in the same closed space for less than two hours with a person who has coronavirus.

Queensland has extended its health restrictions, limiting the number of people who can gather at the Gold Coast and Darling Downs regions.

No more than ten people can gather in Brisbane, Ipswich and Logan without a COVID-19 safety plan, following an initial outbreak at a youth detention centre.

It was extended south to the Gold Coast from 8am Saturday after two Pimpama residents linked to the cluster were diagnosed with the virus. 

The new rules will also come in to effect in the Darling Downs from 8am on Monday, after health alerts were issues for The Southern Hotel and Queens' Park Markets in Toowoomba.
