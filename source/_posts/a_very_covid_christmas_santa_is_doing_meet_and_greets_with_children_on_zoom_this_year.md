Santa will be interacting with children and their families over Zoom this Christmas as the pandemic shuts his Australian grottos.

Rather than visiting the man in red at shopping centres, families will be able to bring him into the safety and comfort of their own home online. 

Zoom Santa links will be offered to those who book a spot online, but the 12-minute one-on-one sessions cost $199 and video recordings are available.

For the first time due to the coronavirus crisis, Santa will be interacting with children and their families over Zoom

The initiative comes from Straight Down The Line Promotions, which has been providing Santas for 25 years across Australia for a whole range of memorable experiences.

Numbers are limited so families should book their Zoom chat with Santa via the Zoom Santa website or Facebook page. 

Shopping centres will also have the chance to have Santa at the centre in a COVID-safe environment by streaming him live.  

Santa will be speaking directly to excited children from his workshop at the North Pole, offering a magical experience the whole family will be talking about for years to come

Children will have the opportunity to interact with the big man himself in shopping centres through a webcam, microphone and large screen TV, as well as have their photo taken via the screen. 

Straight Down the Line Promotions will provide all electronics including the TV Screen, audio, webcam and access to Santa of course, shopping centres only need to provide WIFI.  

Shopping centre management teams are also urged to line up their Santa chats to avoid missing out.
