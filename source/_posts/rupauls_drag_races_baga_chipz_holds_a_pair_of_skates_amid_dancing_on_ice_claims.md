She was seen attending the first batch of auditions for the ITV competition series over the summer.

And Baga Chipz continued to add fuel to claims she's set to join Dancing On Ice as she meet up with professional skater Hamish Gaman and last year's finalist Saara Aalto. 

The RuPaul's Drag Race UK star, 30, held onto a pair of skates as she engaged in a lively conversation with the athlete, 37, and the musician, 33, who she recently collaborated with on their new track When The Sun Goes Down.

Turning heads, the performer stunned in a sequinned puffball dress, complete with a dramatic skirt and balloon-style sleeves.

The drag queen added a pop of colour to her appearance with her choice of footwear as she sported a pair of hot pink heels. 

A curly wig complemented her features, which were enhanced with dewy foundation, glittery eyeshadow and nude lipgloss.

Saara, meanwhile, looked equally glamorous in a bedazzled pink bodysuit, teamed with matching gloves and a cape.

Highlighting her curves, the Finnish artist boosted her frame in thigh-high heeled boots.

Her former skating partner Hamish, who wore a bandage on his finger, cut a smart figure in a navy T-shirt, indigo jeans and boots.

While Baga's status on the show has yet to be confirmed, Myleene Klass was announced as the first celebrity set to take part in the 2021 edition, just one week after she announced her engagement to the father of her one-year-old son Apollo, Simon Motson.

The radio presenter, 42, took to Instagram over the weekend to share the exciting news saying she's 'up for the challenge' and wants to make her daughters 'proud'. 

She told her fans: 'Guess who won't be holding the coats at the side of the rink anymore! I am so, SO excited to be joining the cast of Dancing On Ice.

Line-up: Myleene Klass has been confirmed as the first celebrity set to take part in Dancing On Ice 2021, just one week after she announced her engagement to Simon Motson 

'My girls have always wanted me to do this but I've always been too scared someone will skate over my fingers! 

'Anyway, I want to make them proud and show them I'm up for a challenge when completely out of my comfort zone but most of all, I want a bum like Jlo!'    

Jason Donovan has also been linked to the rink, while Denise Van Outen is said to have signed a deal worth around £40,000 to appear on the series. 

According to the Daily Star, Denise 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month.

A source told the publication: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'

The mother-of-one is a natural performer after reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012 and playing Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway and in the West End.

Another celebrity who is said to have signed on the dotted line is Rebekah Vardy, who allegedly scored a £50,000 deal for the show.

The WAG, 38, is in the midst of a £1 million court battle with Coleen Rooney, 34, and is now said to have set her sights on the reality competition show, according to a report from The Sun on Saturday.

Dancing queens: Denise Van Outen and Rebekah Vardy are also said to have signed up to the next season, scooping £40,000 and £50,000 respectively 

A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'She'll bring star quality to their line-up and interest from footie fans. Of course viewers will be watching for any references to Wagatha Christie. 

'She feels ready to return to the limelight. She can't live under a shadow forever and wants to remind people she's a fun mum.'

The source added that Rebekah's footballer husband Jamie will be on the sidelines to support her.

The Sun also reports that Olympic sprint legend Colin Jackson, 53, has also signed up for the show after proving he's got rhythm back on Strictly Come Dancing in 2005.

Back in July, Coronation Street's Sally Dyvenor and Real Housewives of Cheshire star Dawn Ward were among the TV stars pictured arriving for auditions at an ice rink in Manchester.

They joined WAG Tanya Bardsley, Hollyoaks' Carley Stenson, Celebrity Gogglebox's Mark 'Bez' Berry and Emmerdale's Samantha Giles.

Other stars arriving included Corrie's Sally Whittaker, Alex Fletcher (Brookside), West End star Jodie Prenger, Jake Canuso (Benidorm), and Emmerdale's Joe-Warren Plant and Alex Lincoln.

The upcoming season of Dancing On Ice will be a tough gig for the stars to land, however, as they are also completing against the likes of  Made In Chelsea's Olivia Bentley, TOWIE's Billie Faiers and Love Island's Luke Trotman. 

The trio were seen attending the first batch of auditions alongside former footballer Wayne Bridge, Olympians Denise Lewis and Mark Foster and darts player Fallon Sherrock.  

Fellow reality stars vying for a spot also reportedly include Love Island's Dr Alex George.

Singer Toyah Wilcox is also said to have tried out along with comedian Rufus Hound, This Morning star Lisa Maxwell, Tattoo Fixers star Stephen 'Sketch' Porter and vlogger LadBaby. 

No more: The professional skater line-up will also look a bit different next year as (L-R) 2019 winner Alex Murphy, Alex Demetriou and Brianne Delcourt will not be returning 

Even though the show won't kick off for four months, producers seem keen to form their line-up so the stars would have time to learn basic skating skills over winter.

The professional skater line-up will also look a bit different next year as producers decided not to renew the contracts of 2019 winner Alex Murphy or Alex Demetriou, whilst Brianne Delcourt quit the show after moving to Canada with husband Kevin Kilbane. 

Dancing On Ice bosses are reportedly now keen on setting a new precedent by introducing their first black professional skater. 

In an effort to promote equality and support black, Asian and ethnic minority groups, sources have revealed ITV are making a concerted effort to increase diversity within their cast.
