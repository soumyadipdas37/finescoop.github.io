During her appearance on the show, Vogue discussed her experience of giving birth during the pandemic.

The presenter, who shares seven-week-old Gigi and son Theodore, two, with Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, 32, revealed: 'The only bad thing I would say is not being able to go and see family.

'My sister hasn’t met her and neither has my brother. That’s the only thing. 

'It’s been quite nice other than that because we’ve got to spend so much time together as a family. It’s been a good transition for Theodore.'

Moving on: Waiting around for filming to begin, the Irish presenter seemed to be in good spirits as she brushed off her recent incident with body-shaming trolls

Waiting around for filming to begin, the Irish presenter seemed to be in good spirits as she brushed off her recent incident with body-shaming trolls.   

The broadcaster garnered much adulation when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.

However, the TV star returned to the image-sharing platform to reveal she had also been subject to some 'awful' comments for appearance.  

Bold: Host Steph McGovern turned heads in a vibrant cherry red trouser suit that she teamed with a plain white T-shirt and fresh trainers 

Leggy lady! Miquita Oliver also opted for a scarlet number as she rocked a red floral mini dress that she teamed with black loafers 

Ladies in red: The pair laughed away together on the set before filming began for the show 

The Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!

'I hate the term "snapping back" it’s not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it’s important. My body is different to other people’s, I didn’t do anything specific.

'I’ve only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I’m breastfeeding and it’s important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.

 

Statement: Vogue recently hit back at trolls after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi

'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I’m also VERY tall so there’s a lot more room for a baby.' 

Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I’ve trained since I was 16, for me it’s a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.

'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'
