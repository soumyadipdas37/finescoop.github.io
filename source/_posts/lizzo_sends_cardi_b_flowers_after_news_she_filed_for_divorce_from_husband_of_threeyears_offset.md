Cardi shared how the Truth Hurts singer reached out in a quick clip on her Instagram Story, posting video of flowers and sweet note she was sent.

'Isn't Lizzo the nicest person in the world?' the I Like It rapper, 27, told fans as she showed off the fresh bundle of blooms.

'Look what she sent me!' Cardi squealed.

She was truly touched by the gift, telling fans Lizzo 'is just a beautiful a** person. I just love her, so much.' 

The Juice artist's message to Cardi celebrated her accomplishments instead of wasting time on drama.

'Flowers for a flower!' it read. 'Congrats on all of your successes this summer—know you are loved and are love.' 

The singer - full name Melissa Viviane Jefferson - promised another treat for Cardi soon, adding: 'P.S. I'm sending you something good this week. Love, Lizzo!'

Though Cardi and Lizzo have yet to collaborate on music, both were featured as dancers in Hustlers.

The Bodak Yellow songstress also recently revealed she wanted Lizzo to be in her racy WAP music video but their schedules just didn't match up. 

Lizzo has been keen on supporting the women on her industry. 

In July she also reached out to Megan Thee Stallion with love after she was shot in both feet, allegedly during an argument with Canadian rapper Tory Lanez.

Details about Cardi and Offset's divorce emerged after TMZ obtained documents filed in Superior Court, Fulton County, Georgia on Tuesday.

Cardi, 27, married the hitmaker, 28, in a secret ceremony in 2017 and they share daughter Kulture, two.

In the documents Cardi - real name Belcalis Almanzar - said the relationship was 'irretrievably broken' amid claims he 'cheated throughout the relationship.'  

Offset's infidelity appears to have been the breaking point as a source told People: 'Offset has pretty much cheated the entire time but Cardi looked the other way because of the baby. She also didn't want to be embarrassed. But she's had enough.'

The court documents state that 'there are no prospects for a reconciliation' and that the relationship is 'irretrievably broken.'

However, the documents add that Cardi hopes the divorce 'will be settled by agreement of the parties', according to E! News.

News of the split was first reported by Hollywood Unlocked.  

As well as details of the alleged infidelity, in Cardi's divorce filing, she stated she 'is seeking primary physical custody as well as legal custody' of the couple's child.  

New reports have claimed she is softening her approach to seek a joint custody agreement. 

The Bronx-born recording artist is also seeking child support, although TMZ states the exact amount is unclear.

With the incredible success of her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy, Cardi's assumed net worth is around $24 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, while 28-year-old Offset's fortune is estimated at $26 million.  

Despite what appeared to be an amorous relationship on social media, Offset's last appearance on his wife's Instagram was on August 20 when she shared a clip from his video, Need It. 

Cardi previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018 just five months after the birth of their daughter. 

After she declared they 'grew out of love' and were 'not together anymore, Offset publicly pleaded with her to give him another chance. 

In a lengthy post on his Instagram, he wrote: 'We're going through a lot of things right now, a lot of things in the media. I want to apologize to you Cardi. I embarrassed you. I made you go crazy.'

Sorry: In December 2018, Offset (pictured in January) declared on Instagram: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize.... For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband'

He went on: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize. You know what I'm saying? For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband.'

He added: 'I'm trying to be a better person..... I apologize to you Cardi. I love you.' 

Offset, who's real name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus, has three children with other women: Kalea Marie Cephus, Kody Cephus and Jordan Cephus. 

Cardi's divorce filings indicate that she and Offset have been living separately for some time.

The rapper also requested that Offset cover all of her attorney fees and legal costs throughout the divorce proceedings.

The two apparently don't have a prenuptial agreement, so Cardi is requesting that all assets earned during their marriage be split, as well as any debts accrued during that time.
