Gareth Bale is back on the Tottenham training pitch as he looks to make his return to action after the international break. 

Bale is still awaiting his first game for Jose Mourinho's side after rejoining the club last month but he has stepped up his rehab after picking up a knee injury playing for Wales.

The 31-year-old looked happy to be back on the grass and tweeted: 'Working hard' alongside photos of him being put through his paces by the club's trainers.

The forward is looking to get fit to make his Tottenham debut after the international break

Bale watched Spurs' Carabao Cup victory over Chelsea from the stands on Tuesday and Mourinho confirmed that he would miss the clash with Manchester United on Sunday.

However, he is hopeful the forward will be available to face West Ham on October 17.  

'He is working very hard, very committed, very professional, very happy but not yet ready.

The Welshman looked happy to be back on the grass and tweeted that he is working hard 

'I believe the two weeks of internationals can be important weeks for his last phase of recovering and fitness problem.

'Hopefully to play when we're back to the weekend after national teams. Let's see if it's possible to arrive there.'

Bale will also miss Wales' friendly against England next Thursday as well as the Nations League tie with the Republic of Ireland.

But Ryan Giggs believes the forward will be even better for his national side after ending his nightmare spell at Real Madrid to re-join Tottenham on loan.

'It doesn't matter what quality and experience he possesses, it's always better when you are playing, especially in the international arena when you have two games in a short space of time. 

'He's at a club he knows well with a very good manager and he's said himself it's like going back home.

'He will play more regularly than he did at Madrid. It's a good move for Gareth, it's good for Spurs and good for the Premier League in general, to have someone like that who we can watch every week.'
