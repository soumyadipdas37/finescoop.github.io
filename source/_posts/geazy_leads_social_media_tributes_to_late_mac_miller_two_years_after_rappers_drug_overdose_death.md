G-Eazy led the tributes to late rapper Mac Miller on Monday two years after his death at age 26 from an accidental drug overdose.

The 31-year-old Oakland, California rapper posted a photo of himself and Mac enjoying a pizza party together.

Mac stuck out his tongue as he held a slice of pizza in one hand and a box holding a half-eaten pizza in the other while G-Eazy leaned back and bit into a slice.

'Miss you brother,' G-Eazy wrote in the caption for his roughly 8.7 million followers along with a pair of blue heart emojis.

Pittsburgh native Mac, real name Malcolm James McCormick, died on September 7, 2018 in Los Angeles of an accidental drug overdose at his home.

G-Eazy wasn't the only one to remember the late rapper on social media.

Souly Had, Juicy J, Wale and Mustard also tweeted about Mac.

Many fans also said they were spending the Labor Day holiday listening to his music.

Mac was found unresponsive by his personal assistant at his home in the Studio City area and was pronounced dead by paramedics.

The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office ruled in November 2018 that he died from an accidental drug overdose due to a 'mixed drug toxicity' of fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.

A federal grand jury in October 2019 charged three men with scheming to distribute fentanyl-laced pills that caused the rapper's death.

Cameron James Pettit, of West Hollywood; Stephen Andrew Walter, of Westwood; and Ryan Michael Reavis, formerly of West Los Angeles, were charged in a three-count indictment.

Court documents alleged that Pettit sold the rapper counterfeit oxycodone pills laced with the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl that he ordered from Walter and were delivered by Reavis.

Mac dated pop star Ariana Grande, 27, from August 2016 to May 2018 and featured on her lead single The Way for her debut album, Yours Truly.
