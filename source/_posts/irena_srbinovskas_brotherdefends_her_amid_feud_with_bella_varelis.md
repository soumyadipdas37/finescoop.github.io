Irena Srbinovska's brother Igor has defended the nurse after her former best friend Bella Varelis called her a 'manipulative little b***h'.

Speaking to The Wash on Sunday, Igor, 29, said his sister is the 'most selfless person on earth' and would 'never put someone down'.

'People will always look to peg others down to prop themselves up, Irena has never and will never do anything to put someone down,' he said.

He continued: 'A tenth of her goodness hasn't been shown. She's the best person I know, most selfless person on earth.'

Igor went on to say he's 'extremely proud of Irena and how she's handled herself on the show'.

'Her reactions are a reflection of the person she is, and the way others have reacted are a reflection of the person they are,' he said.

Bella and Irena's feud began shortly after the contestants returned to the mansion after three and a half months of lockdown.

On-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from mid-March until the first week of July, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

During the first post-lockdown cocktail party, a furious Bella, 25, accused Irena, 31, of lying about the extent of her contact with Locky during self-isolation and called her a 'manipulative little b***h'.

'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.

'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women. 

An insider later claimed Bella had been under the impression that she was the only woman having 'lengthy' phone and SMS chats with Locky during self-isolation, when he was in fact having similar contact with several girls. 

'The real reason they fell out was that Bella couldn't accept the fact that Irena had also formed a close connection with Locky during lockdown,' they said.

'She was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close.'
