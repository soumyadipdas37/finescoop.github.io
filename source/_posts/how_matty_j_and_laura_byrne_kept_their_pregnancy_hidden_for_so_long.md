She showed off her rather prominent baby bump when she announced her exciting pregnancy news alongside her fiance, Matty 'J' Johnson, on Thursday night.

And it appears that Laura Byrne has been going to great lengths to keep the news under wraps.

The 31-year-old covered up her baby bump when she stepped out with Matty on Father's Day, just two weeks ago.
