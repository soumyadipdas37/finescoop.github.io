He is gearing up for the release of ITV drama Des, in which he plays notorious serial killer Dennis Nilsen. 

But David Tennant was on dad duty on Saturday as he took two of his five children for swimming lessons in London. 

The actor, 49, cut a casual figure in a black Beatles T-shirt and a baseball cap.

David teamed the look with mustard corduroy trousers, trainers and carried his children's essentials in a grey tote bag.

The former Doctor Who star was every inch the doting dad as he held their hands while they headed to the pool.

David and Georgia have five children; Ty, 18, Olive, nine, Wilfred, Doris and Birdie, 11 months. 

Georgia confirmed the arrival of her fifth child last year with a hilarious Instagram post, as she compared the birth to that of David's Good Omens co-star Michael Sheen's daughter Lyra. 

The actress became pregnant for the first time as a teenager after a fleeting relationship with a university student, which resulted in the birth to Ty at 17. He was later adopted by David in 2012. 

Ty revealed the name of his youngest sibling during an appearance on Lorraine in March, excitedly telling the host he wanted to give a shout-out to his family.

He said: 'Hi mum, I love you mummy. Hi dad, Wilfred, Olive, Doris, Birdie… I love you all. Sorry, I've always wanted to do that,' which led Lorraine to agree that he 'had all the family covered.'

During the interview, Ty also spoke of the moment he met his adopted dad on the set of Doctor Who when he was just five years old. 

The budding actor spoke of his close bond with the sci-fi superstar whom he calls his father, and why he would love to be the third Doctor in the family. 

David met Ty's mum when she had a guest role in the 2008 episode The Doctor's Daughter - and it was then when Ty met his TV hero.

'It was great, I was five when I first met my dad, my mum was working on Doctor Who at the time,' Ty said.

'I watched him on TV as the hero, and it was crazy how much your life can change.'
