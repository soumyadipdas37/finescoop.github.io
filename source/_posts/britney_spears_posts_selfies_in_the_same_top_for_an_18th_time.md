She previously defended wearing the 'same top 17 times' in repetitive posts because 'it's for Project Rose' – her purported photo project.

But Britney Spears was at it again Thursday, populating her feed with more photos from a weeks- (or months-) old shoot in which she wore the exact same strapless white and blue-specked top with her hair adorned with roses. 

The entertainer, 38, again acknowledged the redundancy in the caption, which then meandered into something about a 'thorn in your side'.

Deja vu: Britney Spears was at it again Thursday, populating her feed with more photos in which she wore the same strapless white and blue top with her hair adorned with roses

'"Just a Touch of Rose" ... the 18th post in this top !!!! You never know ... a rose could end up being a THORN in your side ✨!' the caption began.

'Sorry ... thought it was funny!' the ...Baby One More Time singer concluded. 

Perhaps, she meant the post itself was akin to a thorn in her followers' collective side, as they were again subjected to virtually the same photograph of Spears in that top standing under a tree in dappled sunlight.

Britney's latest post comes as the fate of her conservatorship and financial freedom has been the dominant topic among her droves of fans, not to mention friend Paris Hilton.

Here it is again: Britney posted another shot in the top on September 3rd, after multiple previous nearly identical shares

But as always, Brit again looked seemingly happy and carefree in another social media update on Wednesday, sharing a duo of Instagram selfies in which she modeled a patterned hand-stitched top from Morocco.

The post comes after the Womanizer songstress made a rare appearance out in public in Calabasas, California on Tuesday, as the #FreeBritney movement which she has endorsed rages on.

In her recent social media snap, Spears stood with her hands hooked into her khaki short shorts, as she modeled the lovely beige crop top which allowed for her toned midriff to show. 

The mother-of-two wore layered choker necklaces and had her blond hair back in an easy ponytail.

She had her head cocked as she smiled at the camera, revealing her pearly whites.

What's happening here: The second photo in the post revealed one of Britney's now-routine doe-eyed unsmiling selfies

Britney wrote in the caption that she is 'slightly obsessed' with the shirt, even though 'the colors are muted' and she normally prefers 'bright colors'. 

'Ps swipe right for another big eyes moment!' she concluded, referring to the second photo in the post, which revealed one of her now-routine doe-eyed unsmiling selfies.

The post comes after Brit's pal Paris, 39, chimed in on the controversy surrounding the singer's wellbeing and autonomy.

On Andy Cohen's SiriusXM show on Wednesday, Hilton said it was 'unfair' that her friend Spears 'has no control over her life whatsoever'. 

'I saw her this summer. We've had dinners. I saw her in Malibu,' the socialite detailed. 'I just love her so much and I just feel if you're an adult you should be able to live your life and not be controlled.

'And I think maybe that stems from me being controlled so much, so I can understand how that would feel. And I can't imagine, right now, if that was still happening to me,' Paris continued.

'And after working your whole life and working so hard... She's just this icon and I feel like she has no control over her life whatsoever and I don't think that's fair,' she added.

But when Andy asked if Paris specifically discusses legal matters with the Lucky pop star, she responded she doesn't 'bring up things like that.'

'[Britney is] so sweet and so innocent and such a nice girl,' Hilton gushed, instead.

'We just talk about happy things - music, fashion, fun things. I never like to bring up negative things or make people feel uncomfortable, so I've never talked about it with her.'

Yogini: Britney herself hasn't directly brought up any issues on social media, instead sharing innocuous posts displaying, among other things, yoga and dance routines

And while Britney herself hasn't directly brought up the issue on social media either, many fans have speculated that her seemingly innocuous posts – whether they display yoga and dance routines, a flowery photo project, or new fashions – betray a secret or encoded cry for help.

Nevertheless, the Make Me hitmaker often chooses to focus on positivity in her messaging, much like Paris, saying things like 'I think it is a good time to see all of the good that’s happening around us!'

But last week, Spears was reported to have again demanded more control of her conservatorship, which is still managed in part by her father Jamie, 68.

According to TMZ, Britney's attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke'.

The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers.

Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, as reported by TMZ.

'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote.

The outlet added that the Toxic singer said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye.

Britney shares sons Sean Preston, 14 and Jayden James, 13 with ex Kevin Federline.

The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans.

In spite of all this: Spears was reported to have again demanded more control of her conservatorship in court documents last week

Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Toxic crooner to be released from her conservatorship.

'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf.

Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception, has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate and a product of 'conspiracy theorists'.

The court document last week stated of Free Britney: 'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a "joke" as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.'
