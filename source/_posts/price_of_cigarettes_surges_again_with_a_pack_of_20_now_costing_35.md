Smokers across Australia have yet another reason to quit from today.

A 20 pack of cigarettes will rise to $35 a packet September 1, as the federal government's tobacco excise increases for the second time this year by 12.5 per cent.

That means a pack-a-day smoker will be shelling out about $12,500 a years for sparking up.

NSW Nationals MP Michael Johnsen who smoked for 40 years, told 3AW radio that more should be done to encourage vaping - an alternative he says is cheaper and safer.

'We hear the federal government want to ban it all together. I think rather than banning it, in NSW we should be taking the lead and the federal government should be coming along with us in terms of legalising, regulating and taxing it,' Mr Johnsen said.

'It should be used as a way for people that want to get off smoking, to transition out of smoking.'

A year's worth of vaping costs about $1000 in contrast, but at the moment laws around vaping are somewhat complex and all states and territories have their own legislation regarding the sale of e-cigarettes.

Under Australian poison regulations, the possession and use of nicotine for vaping is effectively banned.

But vaporisers and e-cigarettes can be sold without liquid nicotine by vendors.

A person can then legally obtain a prescription for liquid nicotine however most users obtain the highly addictive substance illegally.

'If you look at it in practical terms, rather than spend $12,000 - if they spend $1,000 on vaping or $2,000 because you taxed it - they'd be happy with that and they'd be saving a lot of money and we would be regulating it, so it would be a safe method and a very safe product,' Mr Johnsen said.

'We'd actually be helping the community become a lot healthier.'

The Australian government rakes in about $17billion dollars a year in tobacco tax.

This has led to a surge in black market tobacco trade as organised crime syndicates flood the Australian market with cheap smokes.

The illegal tobacco trade is worth about 600million dollars annually, according to the Australian Border Force.
