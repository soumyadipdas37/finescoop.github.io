Police are investigating whether officers may have played a role in a horror car crash that injured ten people and left a young mother fighting for life after she was flung from a maxi-taxi.

Tamika Wever, 24, suffered horrific head injuries when the taxi she was in was struck by another car at Edgeworth near Newcastle, 160km north of Sydney, on Friday.

She was on the way home from the pub with friends when a Holden Commodore packed with teens allegedly ran a red light and struck the taxi on Friday night. 

It has since been revealed that a police crew had driven past the Commodore and conducted an immediate U-turn to follow it moments before the horrific crash.

Police have now begun a 'critical incident' investigation to look into all circumstances surrounding the crash, The Daily Telegraph reported. 

The 17-year-old alleged P-plate driver of the Commodore is facing 15 charges after being subjected to a roadside breath test and allegedly returned a positive result.  

He was taken to hospital under police guard where he underwent mandatory testing.

The teen has since been charged with 15 offences, including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, negligent driving, driving while disqualified and failing to stop for a red light.

A recording of the Triple 0 call made on the night revealed the carnage paramedics faced when they arrived at the scene.  

'Maxi taxi on the side at least three possibly four persons inside. One person on the road breathing extremely shallowly and lost a lot of blood,' the operator said.

'We're gonna load and go. She's critical, heavily unconscious, with a big brain injury. Keep everyone coming for the other resources,' a male operator said after arriving.

Paramedics treated 11 people for various injuries who were all taken to John Hunter Hospital, with most of the passengers in the Commodore with minor injuries.

The taxi driver, a 46-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman suffered serious injuries while three further taxi passengers - men aged 28, 35 and 47 - suffered minor injuries.

A number of locals rushed to help after being awoken by the loud crash.

'Just kicked in the back window of the maxi taxi, got the other two guys out,' Nick Dupont told Nine News. 

He said the passengers from the Commodore appeared to be traumatised by the accident. One of them was only 14-years old.

Meanwhile friends and family members for Ms Wever are praying she will wake up.



'We all just want you to wake up please, your babies need you. we all need you,' she wrote.

'I held your hand today and kissed you, I told you how much we all need you and how much I love you. You are the strongest person I know and if anyone can do this you can.' 

While another friend revealed her devastation as she shared concerns she may not survive her critical injuries.

'The chances of Tamika's survival is extremely low... this is devastating,' she wrote.

Her cousin Charlii Croese wrote a heartfelt tribute on social media to her 'best friend and rock'

A GoFundMe has been set up by Ms Wever's family-friend Angie Smalley, who described the mother as a 'loving, kind, fun soul'.  

'Suffering severe brain injuries Tamika is fighting for her life …. she is in critical condition with injuries that horrendous I have been told not to expect to recognise my gorgeous friend's face when I go to see her,' Ms Smalley wrote. 

'Tamika is a young amazing mum, always putting her babies first, always smiling, she is funny with an absolute gentle soul that did not deserve this today.'

'Dylan, a hard working, loving fiance to Tamika was also injured in the accident and in hospital.

'Which means their three sons are being loved and looked after by their family members, not knowing why their mummy and daddy are not coming home to them and haven't been home for days.'
