A follower asked Louise 'What was the point you felt you wanted/needed to go on your self care / fitness journey?'

The MIC star replied: 'I was really REALLY unhappy for about 10 years, and I just couldn't shake my old habits.

'I was continuously blacking out and I couldn't see a way out. Then I was introduced to a new way of living... and was also taught to love myself!

'I learnt how to say no. Learnt a lot of new things and mainly the fact that I had a choice.'

London native Louise was encouraged to embark on a healthier lifestyle when she first started dating Ryan in 2016, and has since adopted her own love for fitness.  

Back in April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.

The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December. 

In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'At the beginning it wasn't that easy but we've had to make a really conscious effort to make some changes.

'We are actively working on our relationship now. For the first couple of years in a relationship you're still in that love phase, there are still new things to experience. 

'We've been together for four and a half years now and you do go through phases. You have to try a bit harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'  

'We are communicating more and having chats about what each other wants, so now we have set some boundaries.'

The pair had booked to marry at London's Kew Gardens in December 2019 but cancelled their plans, with Louise saying: 'It's just the bigger picture for myself and Ryan that we need to get to grips with first.'

Months later, Ryan revealed they had agreed on a venue in Ibiza for their wedding to go ahead in spring 2020 – but now Louise says they're still 'figuring out what it is we want' and their plans have come to a halt.

She said: 'No… actually, we haven't, we are still sort of figuring out what it is we want to do because we're so busy with the business.

'I am someone that really wants to have the best day ever and I want to be in the right space, I am just not sure exactly what I want yet.' 

All over: Meanwhile, Louise's younger brother Sam recently parted ways with ex girlfriend Zara after an 18 month relationship, amid claims she cheated on him last year

Meanwhile, Louise's younger brother Sam recently parted ways with ex girlfriend Zara after an 18 month relationship, amid claims she cheated on him while taking part in The X Factor: Celebrity last year. 

The Love Island star was reportedly having crisis talks with Sam in a bid to salvage their relationship.  

Their broken relationship is now reportedly 'hanging in the balance' as the pair have been unable to talk while Sam films The Circle with pal Pete Wicks, but Zara 'is fighting hard to get him back'.

The MIC star has taken some time away from Zara to film the Channel 4 program, The Circle, but that reportedly hasn't stopped her attempts to ask for forgiveness.
