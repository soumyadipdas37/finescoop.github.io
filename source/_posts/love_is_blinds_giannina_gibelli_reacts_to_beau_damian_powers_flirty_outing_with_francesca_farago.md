Love Is Blind star Giannina Gibelli has something to say about boyfriend Damian Powers' recent outing with Too Hot Too Handle bombshell Francesca Farago.

The Netflix star, 27, took to Instagram to hint at her feelings Sunday, almost a week after Farago, 27, was seen clinging to Powers' arm after dinner together at LA hotspot Eveleigh last Tuesday.

But Giannina didn't seem threatened by their friendship, sharing a sexy outfit shot while warning gossips to 'stay in your lane' in the caption.

While some commenters thought she was taking aim at swimsuit designer Farago with her caption, Gibelli made her target clear in a reply.

'I think we know who dis about,' wrote one follower, to which Giannina replied, 'There's no bad blood on any level, it's all good.'

'You tell them girl and when I say them I mean the media,' another fan wrote, earning an 'exactly' from the blonde beauty - who met Powers on the first season of Love Is Blind.

She proved that things with Damian were more than fine in an Instagram Story post which showed the food industry pro planting a kiss on her cheek while they were joined for their meal by friend/Love Is Blind insider Paria Sadighi.

No drama: Some commenters thought she was taking aim at swimsuit designer Farago but she made it clear rumor-starters were the thing irking her

'My dinner dates,' the glamorous Venezuelan/American wrote, adding a white heart emoji and tagging both. 

Powers tried to clear the air on Saturday, telling Entertainment Weekly that the pair were introduced by their mutual attorney, who arranged for the fellow Netflix reality stars and their friends to enjoy an evening in LA.

When the group was met with paparazzi during their exit, Farago clung to his arm for security. 

Powers told the outlet: 'Over the past week, I have been in LA with my attorney, Alex Ion, pursuing new projects and business ventures. Francesca and I both share the same attorney,' Damian explained.

'Alex arranged for both Francesca and I to meet with him for dinner at the Eveleigh in West Hollywood along with some of our other friends, including Mitchell Crawford and Raiane Macedo.'

'We all planned to leave the Eveleigh together in the same car. Francesca, Alex, Mitchell and Raiane all exited through a side entrance, while I exited through the main entrance of the Eveleigh,' he continued. 

'Upon exiting the Eveleigh, we were all greeted by paparazzi. Francesca grabbed on to me in an attempt to shield herself from the paparazzi as our entire group entered the car. 

'Francesca and I are not dating or romantically involved but remain friends,' he concluded. 

Farago seems to have her heart elsewhere, seen getting very cozy with Aussie model Casey Boonstra, 26, during their trip to Venice Beach last week.

Playing the field: Francesca has been linked to multiple people following her June break-up from her boyfriend Harry Jowsey, who she met on Too Hot Too Handle

Francesca and the beauty were seen holding hands and embracing each other, all while showing off their glowing smiles. 

Francesca has been linked to multiple people following her June break-up from her boyfriend Harry Jowsey, including YouTuber Tana Mongeau and Jersey Shore's Vinny Guadagnino. 

She met Harry and began dating during her stint on Netflix's Too Hot To Handle.

She stated at the time that he instigated the break-up because 'he couldn't do long-distance anymore.'

Harry confirmed as much in a follow-up video, though he claimed the split was for the sake of his mental health.

And Francesca, or Frankie, posted her own confessional YouTube video in June, in which she discussed the breakup as well and how she needed to 'move on'.
