A dog owner was savagely mauled to death by his own Rottweiler following an argument with his roommate.   

Dave Whitney, 59, was brutally attacked inside his home in Morley, 10km northeast of Perth's CBD, on Monday night. 

Mr Whitney, a former broadcast operator, was arguing with roommate Brody Gardner, 36, when his Rottweiler inflicted the deadly injuries, Nine News reported.

Emergency services were called to Mr Whitney's home (pictured) in Morley, 10km northeast of Perth's CBD, on Monday night and tried to save the dad after he sustained life threatening-injuries 

Emergency services were called to the Halvorson Road home at 8.10pm, responding to an animal complaint, and found the Perth father with life-threatening injuries.

Paramedics desperately worked to keep Mr Whitney alive but he died at the scene. 

Detectives from the homicide squad were called to take over the investigation and the Rottweiler was seized by an animal ranger.

The dog was later put down after it lunged at officers.  

Mr Gardner was questioned by homicide detectives after the attack and was released without charge. 

Mr Whitney's neighbours said they had complained about the dog to the local council and said the Rottweiler had attacked several children.

'He's attacked numerous children. It's heart-wrenching because we could have prevented some of this,' Danielle Marendaz said. 

Neighbours said Mr Whitney (pictured second from left) and his roommate were also attacked by the dog in April and had been rushed to hospital to receive surgery

Neighbours also said the Rottweiler had previously attacked its owner.

Both Mr Whitney and Mr Gardner were rushed to hospital in April and needed plastic surgery to address their injuries.     

'They got in an attack a couple of months ago and I had to take both of them to hospital.

'They knocked on my door and they both had gashes on their arms and legs and stuff, and they were in hospital for like three days,' Hailie Featherstone told ABC. 

Friends described Mr Whitney, who previously worked at channel Seven and Ten, as a 'gentle' and 'down-to-earth man'.

The investigation is ongoing.
