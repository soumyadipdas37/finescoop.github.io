A Utah dog uses a 'cheesy' smile to avoid getting into trouble.  

Kellie Rossi Larsen, of Logan, Utah, captured pet Nova's toothy grin on video after he was caught relieving his bowels on her carpet. 

'Nova, what is this?' Larsen can be heard saying in the video as the dog, Nova, tries to slink past her.

'What is this? Was this you? Did you poop in the house?' she asks as she alternates between showing the dog and the offending excrement in question. 

A Utah woman's dog, Nova, was caught on video making the 'cheesy' grin he uses when attempting to get out of trouble, in this case, pooping on the carpet

In response, Nova sits down and mugs for his owner, showing off all of his teeth in a wide grin.   

'We recently moved into a new house, and one of our three dogs, Nova, had a little accident in the house because everything is new and confusing,' Larsen told ViralPig.

'When Nova thinks he's in trouble he does that cheesy smile to try and get out of it.'
