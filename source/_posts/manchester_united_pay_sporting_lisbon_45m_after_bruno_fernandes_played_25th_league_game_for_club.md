Manchester United reportedly paid Sporting Lisbon £4.5million after their dramatic 3-2 win over Brighton as an add-on clause was activated in Bruno Fernandes' contract.

Fernandes scored a last-gasp penalty in the 100th minute of the thrilling match at the Amex Stadium on Saturday, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side picked up their first points of the season on the South Coast. 

The 26-year-old arrived in January via an initial £45million deal rising to £66.7million if all the add-ons are met. United paid Sporting £2.74million after qualifying for the Champions League on the final day of last season.

And according to Portuguese news outlet Record, Fernandes made his 25th Premier League appearance for the Red Devils which cost United another £4.5million. 

Fernandes has made a significant difference since arriving at Old Trafford in January, scoring 13 goals in 25 appearances for Solskjaer's side and producing for the Premier League giants in big moments.

That was clear to see in the tense victory over Brighton, which saw the Red Devils come from behind to claim all three points. 

Fernandes started the match by giving away a penalty himself - clipping the heels of promising right-back Tariq Lamptey to allow Neal Maupay to open the scoring.

While United were unlucky not to be further behind in the match, as Brighton hit the woodwork five times in total with Leandro Trossard hitting a hat-trick of attempts against the frame of the goal, they pulled level through Lewis Dunk's own goal just before the interval. 

Brighton saw a given penalty cancelled out by VAR in the second period before Marcus Rashford's superb solo goal put United in front for the first time in the match but Brighton looked like they had snatched a point when Solly March headed home in injury time at the far post.

But the drama was not over yet as Harry Maguire headed the ball onto Maupay's arm and while Chris Kavanagh blew the full-time whistle seconds later, the official checked VAR to spot the offence and gave the penalty which Fernandes dispatched.

Rio Ferdinand praised the Portuguese midfielder for his composure to slot the penalty, telling BT Sport: 'This man is ice cold in these situations.

'He changed his run-up a little bit there from his usual hop, skip and jump thing. The pressure was on but he calmed himself down and went back to basics.'

Fellow BT Sport pundit Joe Cole added:  'We could see that while all the melee was going on, Bruno was the coolest man in this building. It was a great penalty.'
