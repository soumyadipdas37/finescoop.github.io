Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has thanked London mayor Sadiq Khan for his letter of support for his campaign to end child food poverty - and vowed that he is 'more determined than ever' to eradicate the problem.

The 22-year-old Manchester United and England striker has formed a task force along with some of the UK's biggest supermarkets and food brands designed to address the issue after persuading the Government to extend free school meals over the summer during lockdown.

His campaign has earned him widespread plaudits and an award from the Professional Footballers' Association, and now London's Mayor has thrown his weight behind the initiative.

Liverpool fan Khan joked that it was tough to be complimentary of a United player but praised the work Rashford has done.

In the letter, Khan wrote: 'As a child, I benefited from free school meals. Life would have been much harder for my family if we didn't have them and I know how important they are.

'Your campaign, as well as the tireless efforts of charities and campaigners, many of whom we work with here in London, meant hundreds of thousands of children received the vital support they desperately needed over the summer holiday.

'But our fight to end child poverty doesn't stop here. Every child should have the right to healthy, affordable and sustainable food no matter what their circumstances or where they live.

'I will continue doing everything within my power to end the pandemic that is food poverty and support the most vulnerable children in our society so that each one of them can fulfil their potential, as you have done.

'Thank you once again for your inspiring work and best of luck in the future (apart from when you are playing at Anfield!)'

Rashford reposted Khan's post on Twitter, writing: 'More determined than ever, thank you for your kind words @SadiqKhan.'

He added: 'I do what I do for Liverpool as much as anywhere. Children all over the UK are crying out for our help. This is much bigger than me, than football, than politics. It’s time we all started listening, instead of clouding our views will allegiances and rivalries.'
