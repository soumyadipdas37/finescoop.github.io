Carrie Underwood forgot to mention her family at the Academy Of Country Music Awards in Nashville on Wednesday evening.

When the 37-year-old blonde beauty accepted the Entertainer of the Year award - which she split with Thomas Rhett - she left out husband of 10 years Mike Fisher and their kids Jacob and Isaiah out of her speech.

'I'm a dummy,' said the Cry Pretty crooner later while in the press room.

An honest mistake: Carrie Underwood forgot to mention her family at the Academy Of Country Music Awards in Nashville on Wednesday evening

Mike who? When the 37-year-old blonde beauty accepted the Entertainer of the Year award - which she split with Thomas Rhett - she left out husband Mike Fisher and their kids Jacob and Isaiah out of her speech; seen in 2019

The star was dressed to the nines as she held her trophy. 

'First, I want to say that I’m a dummy for not mentioning my husband or my children in my acceptance speech,' she began.

'You would think after this many years of seeing other people do speeches and giving some of my own, I would think of people that are important to me, so I’m sorry!'

She added, 'But I do love my children and my husband.'

Uh-oh: 'I'm a dummy,' said the Cry Pretty crooner later while in the press room

The former TV star did remember to thank God.

'Thank you, God, so much. All glory, glory to God. Thank to the ACM not just for this, but for putting me in such incredible company. I am more than happy to share this with Thomas Rhett and to have my name mentioned with his and Luke [Bryan] and Luke [Combs] and Eric Church. I am beyond honored. Thank you, gushed Underwood.

Then she gave a nod to her work team.

'You guys, hold on. [Concerts] will happen again. Just hold on!' she said of lockdown. 

During the show the of American Idol winner of 2005 paid tribute to Dolly Parton, Patson Cline and other queens of country as she performed a medley of hits.

She dazzled in a red floral gown, as she marked the 95th anniversary of the historic Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, where she took the stage.

She prefaced the song, speaking to the empty audience: 'Patsy and Loretta, Martina and Barbara, Reba and Dolly. These strong voices mean so much to me and to all the other female artists who stand on their shoulders.

'They are some of my heroes, and I am so honored to stand alongside them as a fellow member of the Grand Ole Opry. It's my pleasure to pay tribute to these legendary ladies as we celebrate the Opry's 95th anniversary.'

Carrie launched into Cline's Crazy, before transitioning into Loretta Lynn's You Ain't Woman Enough, Barbara Mandrell's I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool and Why'd You Come in Here by Parton.

She also squeezed Reba McEntire's The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia and Martina McBride's A Broken Wing into the medley.
