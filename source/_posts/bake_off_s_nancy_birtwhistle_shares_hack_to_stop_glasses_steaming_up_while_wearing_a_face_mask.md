Bake Off star Nancy Birtwhistle has shared a simple yet effective tip for stopping glasses from steaming up while wearing a face mask.

The grandmother-of-eight, who won the fifth series of the popular baking show, regularly shares household hacks on her Instagram page.

Yesterday she revealed a clever way of preventing spectacles and sunglasses from fogging up when wearing a protective face covering.

Sharing a video - appropriately set to the song Steamy Windows by Tina Turner - Nancy demonstrated how it works.

Bake Off star Nancy Birtwhistle has shared a simple yet effective tip for stopping glasses from steaming up while wearing a face mask, which involves putting a drop of dish soap on the lens and rubbing it in

Explaining in a comment that she uses 'eco friendly washing up liquid that has no harsh chemicals', Nancy squeezes a drop onto one lens.

She then rubs the detergent into the glass using her finger before wiping any residue with a cloth.

Nancy then puts the glasses on, while donning a stylish black and white polka dot face mask, to put it to the test.

Miraculously the side which had dish soap applied to it remained clear, while the other fogged up in seconds.

Many of Nancy's fans commented on the post, thanking her for sharing the handy tip. 

One wrote: 'As someone with terrible vision who works in healthcare and needs to wear a mask for long hours you are saving my life right now!'

Another commented: 'Thank you for that Nancy. You are an absolute genius.'

'Oh my goodness, that's amazing! Does it look smudgy though?' one asked, to which Nancy replied: 'No - wipe it on with the finger and off with a cloth. Try it.' 

Last month the 2014 Bake Off winner shared an eco-friendly way to shift grass and food stains from clothing in as little as two hours.

Taking to Instagram, Nancy showed off her 'genius' cleaning hack - which simply requires cold water and distilled white vinegar - in a series of short videos.
