Britons have flocked to beauty spots and the beaches as temperatures hit 70F (21C) today before soaring to 87F (30C) next week.

The UK will see a north-south split in terms of weather over this weekend - the last before more stringent coronavirus restrictions come into effect.

The Met Office has issued a weather warning for western Scotland where as much as 150mm of rain could fall in hilly areas, while temperatures could go as high as 77F (25C) in south England and increase further into next week.

Boris Johnson will bring in the so-called 'rule of six' from Monday in England meaning groups of more than half a dozen cannot meet socially, while lockdown will be imposed in the West Midlands from Tuesday.

Parts of Scotland will be hit by torrential downpours that could bring almost a month's worth of rain in just one day, with a yellow weather warning in place from 6pm on Saturday to Sunday evening.

But the south of the country will have a largely fine and dry weekend with long spells of autumn sunshine, according to the Met Office.

Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said the 'tropical continental air pushing up from a southerly direction in combination with light winds' will see temperatures of up to 25C on Sunday and then 29C (84F) by Monday.

The top temperatures expected on Tuesday could hit 31C (88F) and remain into Wednesday, but there is the possibility of some thunderstorms mixed in.

'It definitely feels like one last blast of summer even though we are, meteorologically speaking, in autumn,' she added.

The September heat follows on from an August heatwave which saw temperatures top out at 34C for six days running last month.

The September warmth follows on from an August heatwave which saw temperatures hit 93F (34C) for six days running last month.

The highest temperature ever recorded in September was 96.08F (35.6C) on September 2, 1906, but they 'don't look like they're going to come anywhere close to that in this current hot spell', the forecaster said.

The warmest September day of recent years was September 13, 2016, when 93.9F (34.4C) was recorded at Gravesend, Kent - the warmest day of that year.

After a sunny Saturday across the nation, the evening will bring the wet weather to parts of western and north western Scotland 'for what looks like at least 24 hours'.

A yellow weather warning is in force for the region through Saturday and Sunday, advising that there could be floods and communities cut off as 150mm of rainfall is expected. The average rain in September is 155.9mm.

Cornwall, Devon and Dorset will be bracing for a fresh influx of tourists as sunseekers flock to the sandy beaches in the South West.

Yet local MPs and police appear to be welcoming holidaymakers, with calls for people to be vigilant and stick to social distancing rules.

MP for East Devon Simon Jupp told MailOnline: 'I'm really encouraged by the continued low level of cases of coronavirus in Devon and the South West, despite the number of visitors which provided a much-needed cash-flow into our economy.

'It's still as critical as ever that people take personal responsibility to keep themselves and each other safe – hand washing, covering your face in certain indoor settings, and getting a test if you've got symptoms.

'The new restrictions are easier to understand and easier to enforce. We should all play our part to help beat the virus.' 

MP for North Devon Selaine Saxby added: 'Cases remain low in North Devon this week, and our tourism and hospitality businesses are looking forward to seeing visitors as they have since lockdown eased.

'The vast majority of our visitors have been very compliant with the guidelines. Outdoors transmission remains low, and most travel to my constituency to enjoy the great outdoors.'

Gatherings of more than six people either indoors and outdoors, at home or in a pub will be illegal in England from Monday. A single household or support bubble that is larger than six will still be able to gather.

Covid-secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality settings can still hold more than six in total. 

Education and work settings are not affected by the new rules. Weddings and funerals can also still go ahead with a limit of 30 people if conducted in a Covid-secure way.
