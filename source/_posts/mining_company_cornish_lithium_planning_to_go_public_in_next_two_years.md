Cornish Lithium said this week it had found 'globally significant' deposits of the green metal

A mining company that has found world-leading reserves of lithium in Cornish hot springs is planning to go public in the next two years.

Cornish Lithium said this week it had found 'globally significant' deposits of the green metal that could create hundreds of jobs and revive the county's mining industry.

The firm has previously raised £1.7million on crowdfunding site Crowdcube, as well as securing cash from other private investors. 

But it also plans a stock market float, likely on AIM. Founder and chief executive Jeremy Wrathall said the company was 'actively thinking about how to go public'.

Lithium is in incredible demand and is best-known for its use in electric car batteries.
