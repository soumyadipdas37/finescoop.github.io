Katie Price has revealed that Harvey was 'chuffed with himself' on Monday after looking at a college as she shares a heartwarming picture of her eldest son. 

The former glamour model, 42, posted a picture of a beaming Harvey Price, 18, to her Instagram and described how proud he was after visiting the further education centre.  

Harvey has multiple disabilities including blindness, Prader-Willi syndrome and ADHA and was rushed into intensive care in June experiencing extreme chest pains.

Earlier this month, Katie revealed Harvey, who does not have a relationship with his biological father, Dwight Yorke, wanted her boyfriend Carl Woods to be his dad.

In an Instagram video, Katie asked: 'Harv, what do you want mummy and Carl to do?' to which the teenager responded: 'Be with mummy and Harvey and Carl... your daddy.'

As Katie asked Harvey: 'Do you? Do you love Carl that much?' he replied, 'Yes mum.'

As she added, 'You're so cute', Harvey went, 'I know, tell me about it.'   

Katie dated Harvey's biological father Dwight, 48, from 2000-2001, and has criticised the footballer for his alleged lack of contact with Harvey. 

In her 2016 book Reborn, the mother-of-five insisted Dwight was unwilling to accept the limitations of his son's disabilities.

In June Harvey was rushed to intensive care after he had trouble breathing. 

He experienced extreme chest-pains and a soaring temperature and was thought to be at risk of organ failure. 

Katie recalled seeing eight doctors crowding around him in the resuscitation room and said she was 'terrified' by the horrific ordeal.

Harvey was discharged from hospital in July ten days after he was rushed into intensive care.  

Due to Harvey's complex needs, he lives in residential care, but has been home with Katie amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Katie is also mother to son Junior, 15, and daughter Princess, 13, with ex-husband Peter Andre and son Jett, six, and daughter Bunny, five, with estranged husband Kieran Hayler.
