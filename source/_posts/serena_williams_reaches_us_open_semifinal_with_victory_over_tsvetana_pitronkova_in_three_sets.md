Serena Williams booked her place in the US Open semi-final with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Tsvetana Pironkova.

The six-time champion dropped the first set in the last eight tie with the unseeded Bulgarian claiming an unlikely 6-4 win.

Prionkova then broke Williams in the first game of the second set but the American fought back and found the break at 3-3 to give her the advantage for a 6-3 win and force the match into a deciding set.

A ruthless third set for Williams saw her break early on before her comfortable serving and another break in the seventh handed her the victory and progression to the semi-final.
