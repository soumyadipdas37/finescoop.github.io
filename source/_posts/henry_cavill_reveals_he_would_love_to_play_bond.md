Henry Cavill has revealed that he would 'absolutely jump at the opportunity' to play James Bond after Daniel Craig is set to step down after the film No Time to Die.

The Witcher star, 37, described how he would 'love to play Bond' if producers Barbara Broccoli and Micheal G. Wilson were interested in him taking on the role. 

Henry, who stars as Sherlock in the Netflix film Enola Holmes, auditioned for the part of Bond aged 22 and is understood to have come close to landing the role of 007. 

New chapter? Henry Cavill (pictured in 2019), 37, has revealed that he would 'absolutely jump at the opportunity' to play James Bond after Daniel Craig is set to step down after the film No Time to Die

Speaking to GQ, he said: 'If Barbara [Bond producer Barbara Broccoli] and Mike [co-producer Michael G. Wilson] were interested in that, I would absolutely jump at the opportunity.'  

'At this stage, it’s all up in the air. We’ll see what happens. But yes, I would love to play Bond, it would be very, very exciting.' 

Henry lost out on the role of Bond to Daniel Craig when he did a screen-test for the role.

The test involved him walking out of a bathroom wrapped in a towel where he had to re-enact a scene from the era of Sean Connery who played Bond from 1962 to 1983. 

Speaking to Men's Health in 2019, Henry said: 'I probably could have prepared better. 

'I remember the director, Martin Campbell, saying, ‘Looking a little chubby there, Henry.’ I didn’t know how to train or diet. 

'And I’m glad Martin said something, because I respond well to truth. It helps me get better.' 

MailOnline has contacted the production company of the James Bond film series, Eon Productions, for comment.

The bets are off! Betting has been suspended on Tom Hardy (pictured in 2015) becoming the new James Bond as fans are convinced he will be named as Daniel Craig's replacement

Earlier this week betting was suspended on Tom Hardy becoming the new James Bond following reports he has been named as Daniel Craig's replacement.

Speculation has reached fever pitch in recent days amid claims the actor, 43, had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition.

All bets on who will be the next Bond are off, after Hardy's odds were slashed from 6/1 to 1/1, amid the swirling rumours about the spy franchise's new lead. 

Rumour mil: Speculation has reached fever pitch in recent days following reports the actor, 43, had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition

The Venom star has been one of the bookies favourites to take over the role since the market opened in September last year, when he was 9/1 to be cast as Bond.

When the bookmakers market closed, James Norton was the second favourite actor to bag the part at 9/4, followed by Idris Elba (11/2), Sam Heughan (6/1) and Richard Madden (7/1).   

Oddschecker spokesperson Callum Wilson: 'For years we've heard speculation about who will replace Daniel Craig as James Bond, and finally it seems that English heart-throb Tom Hardy is the man for the role. '

Next in line? The movement seems to have shifted following a report from the Vulcan Reporter , in which it claims Hardy is next in line for 007

'The versatile Hardy would certainly be a popular choice – and attracted 54% of all bets in the 24 hours before the market was suspended.'   

The movement seems to have shifted following a report from the Vulcan Reporter, in which it claims Hardy is next in line for 007. 

Tom has been one of the bookies favourites to become the next 007 in recent years, and rumours have been circulating he will step into Craig's shoes after his fifth and final film, No Time To Die.

New bond? All bets on who will be the next Bond are off, after Tom's odds were slashed from 6/1 into 1/1, amid the swirling rumours about the iconic part

The Vulcan Reporter claims that Hardy had been offered the role after a successful audition, while bookies odds on the star have now been slashed in half.

The publication reports producers had planned to unveil Tom as James Bond in November- the same month No Time To Die was due to be released. 

However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the Vulcan Reporter state the announcement will now be made later this year or early 2021.

Earlier this week bookies have slashed odds on The Peaky Blinders star from 8/1 to just 4/5 in the past 24 hours after a flurry of bets.

Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: 'A flurry of bets over the past 24 hours suggests the cat is out the bag and it's Tom Hardy that'll soon be replacing Daniel Craig as 007.' 

The Taboo star has made no secret about wanting to be the next 007 - but has previously refused to talk about the part in fear it will get him blacklisted. 

Speaking to the Daily Beast, the heart-throb admitted: 'If I mention it, it's gone.

'You know, there's a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting, and in the fellowship of my peer group, that if you talk about it you're automatically out of the race.

'So I can't possibly comment on that one!'
