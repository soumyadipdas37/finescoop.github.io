England's long-awaited return is finally over as Gareth Southgate's men take on Iceland in their first Nations League clash this evening.

The Three Lions will be targeting a strong start in Group B after the lengthy wait for their first international clash of the year - and a host of uncapped players, including Phil Foden, may feature at senior level for the first time.

Southgate will be wary of suffering another shock defeat to Iceland after the humiliation at Euro 2016 with Denmark still to come on Tuesday.
