A Tennessee man has been charged with reckless homicide, more than two years after he allegedly kicked a pregnant woman in the stomach during a dispute, leading to the death of her unborn baby. 

The Shelby County District Attorney's Office on Tuesday announced the indictment of 29-year-old Cedric Mingo. He also faces additional domestic assault charges.   

Mingo, from Whitehaven, initially was charged with assault, but additional medical information led to the homicide charges, according to Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich. 

Cedric Mingo, 29, has been indicted on charges of reckless homicide and domestic assault in the death of a woman's unborn baby 

Investigators said the incident took place on March 9, 2018, when Mingo punched a pregnant woman in the face during an argument and kicked her in the stomach after she fell to the ground. 

The unnamed victim, who was seven months pregnant at the time, later began having unspecified difficulties and lost the baby in April. 

Weirich's statement did not say whether Mingo and the woman had been in a romantic relationship.  

Online arrest records show Mingo was arrested a year ago in Texas on an unrelated assault charge. 

Social media posts indicate that Mingo has a young daughter and a son.
