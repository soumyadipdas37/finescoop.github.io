Four years ago, he tried to give AFL WAG Rebecca Judd a kiss on the cheek live on air - which she awkwardly rejected.

And on Thursday, sports presenter Tony Jones made a surprising confession on 9News Melbourne's Unmasked series.

'I am insanely shy. I'm actually really shy,' he revealed to co-hosts Peter Hitchener and Jo Hall.

Surprising admission: Channel Nine sports presenter Tony Jones confesses he is 'insanely shy' after AFL WAG Rebecca Judd rejected his kiss live on air

Unfortunately, Tony's admission was met with sighs from his co-hosts, Peter turned to Jo for input, and she said: 'I'm not surprised by that.'

'Well, I'll tell you what, you cover it very well,' Peter followed up.

'Well, I could not ever walk into a party on my own or anything like that... I am insanely shy,' he reiterated.

Jo backed him up by saying that he believed he could have the same confidence, like when they emcee a function.

Tony explained that being on stage doesn't worry him, explaining: 'It's the fact that I can't just go up and speak to somebody. I can't do that.'

In August 2016, the sports presenter had a very awkward encounter with Rebecca Judd on her final day on Nine News Melbourne before going on maternity leave. 

Tony said 'Good luck, Bec!' before leaning in to try and give the AFL WAG a peck on the cheek.

At that moment, the WAG instinctively pulled away and yelped, before bursting into fits of giggles.

Realising he had just been rejected on camera, Tony crossed his arms and grumbled, 'OK, good, this is going well,' as his face turned red.
