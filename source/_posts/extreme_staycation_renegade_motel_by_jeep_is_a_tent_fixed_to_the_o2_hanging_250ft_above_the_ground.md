London is home to some of the world’s most luxurious places to stay – and now one of the most extreme.

Behold the ‘Renegade Motel’ – a hanging tent fixed to one of The O2’s lofty yellow pylons nearly 250ft above the ground that adventurous staycationers can apply to stay in for free.

The not-for-the-faint-hearted accommodation is being offered by Jeep to celebrate the arrival of its new Renegade 4xe plug-in hybrid – and motel guests will be given one to drive to The O2.

Upon arrival, they will get a sneak peek of where they’ll stay that night while they enjoy The O2’s roof-walk experience, Up at The O2.

They will then dine in The O2 before heading up to their Renegade Motel ‘room’ for ‘the most epic Motel stay ever’.

The experience also includes breakfast, the services of a 24-hour concierge, and a few other extras ‘inspired by the new Renegade PHEV’ - a Wif-Fi hotspot, Amazon Alexa connectivity and a portable power supply charged by the hybrid Renegade.

A rain cover and ‘a couple of very warm sleeping bags’ are also supplied.

And the strategy should nature's call need to be answered?

Jeep said the nearest toilet is back in the main O2 building and that it takes about five to 10 minutes to get safely back down from the ledge and pylon. However, a cliff camping expert will be on hand 24/7 to help guests navigate the journey.

Damien Dally, country manager Jeep UK, said: ‘Jeep has always been known as a brand that enables its drivers to fulfil their outdoor adventures. With the launch of our Renegade 4xe plug-in hybrid we now have a car that makes urban exploring even more accessible. No Congestion Charge, no ULEZ, just adventure.

‘By suspending the world’s first urban cliff camping Motel on The O2 roof, we’re giving Britons a unique opportunity to see and enjoy London from an exhilarating new vantage point.’

Following the launch of the Renegade Motel, Jeep will introduce Renegade ‘Roof Top’ Motels - where guests stay in a pop-up rooftop tent (pictured)

Steve Sayer, VP and GM of The O2, added: ‘We’re thrilled that Jeep has chosen our venue for the first-ever urban cliff camping Motel and we’re really looking forward to seeing it suspended from one of our iconic yellow pylons. The guests are in for a real treat and will experience some amazing views of London during their stay in the Renegade Motel.’

Following the launch of the Renegade Motel, Jeep will then be introducing Renegade ‘Roof Top’ Motels ‘in a select number of UK city locations’.

But this time the experience will be a bit tamer, as the accommodation will come in the form of a TentBox portable pop-up tent that sits on the roof of the Renegade. 

For this competition experience, each winner will be given a Renegade 4xe to drive to a chosen location, where another car will have been set up with the tent already laid out, along with plenty of home comforts. 

Renegade Motel stays are being offered on either September 18 or 19. Two lucky winners will be randomly selected for the thrilling experience.
