Tottenham fans were left frustrated in their attempts to watch their side's Europa League qualifying tie against Lokomotiv Plovdiv after seeing television pictures disappear.

The second-round qualifying tie in Bulgaria, broadcast on subscription channel Premier Sports, frequently cut out during the first half on Thursday for fans watching in the UK.

Fans vented their anger over the coverage of social media before the broadcast disappeared completely with eight minutes to go before half-time.

One fan tweeted: 'I don't know what's worse. The performance or the Premier Sports channel.'

'We are sorry for the picture break up on the game,' it read.

'There is an issue with the host broadcasters satellite uplink that is affecting all international takers. We are working with the supplier to resolve.'
