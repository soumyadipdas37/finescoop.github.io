A desperate mum managed to land a huge payout after investigating her daughter's horror car crash. 

Amateur detective Nancy spent almost four years looking into Alicia's accident at Launching Place, east of Melbourne, after her daughter's car collided with a tree. 

Police said the 19-year-old was the only person involved in the crash and she had lost control around a bend before she was cut from her car and airlifted to hospital.  

Nancy said her 'mother's intuition' told her something else prompted the crash, A Current Affair reported.    

Single mum Nancy spent four years investigating her daughter Alisha's (Alisha pictured in hospital) horror car crash after police ruled the 19-year-old was the only driver involved 

Alisha suffered a traumatic brain injury and couldn't remember the accident but she told her mum someone else was involved.   

'I had a gut feeling that there was a red car involved. But the first thing I remember for that day is getting staples in my head,' Alicia explained. 

This prompted Nancy to begin her sleuthing and she returned to the crash site multiple times to try and figure out what happened.   

'I had to find the answers, for Alisha's sake, because she kept blaming herself and I wasn't going to have her live the rest of her life thinking that it was her fault,' Nancy said. 

The mum also posted in a local community page on Facebook to find any witnesses or the mystery caller.   

'I wanted to say thank you to the person that rang me and to try and get any information I could. I just wanted every little bit of information I could so I could keep putting the puzzle together,' she explained. 

A family member of the man in the red car reached out to Nancy and she managed to speak to the driver over the phone.  

Nancy investigated the details surrounding the crash (Alisha's car pictured) at Launching Place, east of Melbourne, and discovered another driver caused her daughter to swerve 

The man told Nancy that Alisha over-reacted to him swerving around the bend and then crashed into the tree.  

He later refused to give a statement to police and told Nancy he had the right to remain silent.   

The mum also received a tip about a customer at Fast Freddie's Tyre Service, in Healesville, speaking about the crash on the day of the accident.    

She managed to speak to a man named Jurgen who turned out to be the mystery caller about Alisha's crash. 

Jurgen told Nancy he spoke to the man in the red car and the driver confessed he had been looking at his phone and swerved when he came around the bend.   

Nancy urged Jurgen to make a statement about 'the final piece of the puzzle' and he reported the other driver to police. 

Alisha was eventually awarded a six-figure compensation from the Victorian Transport Accident Commission since another driver was involved. 

The 19-year-old plans to use the payout on further rehabilitation and establish a wildlife charity with her mum.
