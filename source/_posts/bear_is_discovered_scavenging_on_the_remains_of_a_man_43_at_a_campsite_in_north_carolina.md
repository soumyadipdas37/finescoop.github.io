A bear has been put down after it was found scavenging on the remains of a 43-year-old man at a campsite in North Carolina.

Rangers at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park identified the man as Patrick Madura from Elgin, Illinois.

Hikers discovered an unoccupied tent and human remains scattered close to Hazel Creek Trail on Friday evening, the Charlotte Observer reported.

When law enforcement rangers rushed to the site they saw a black bear 'actively scavenging on the remains' and euthanized it.

'Our wildlife biologists, who are experts in human-bear conflicts, believe that once a bear has scavenged on the remains of humans that they pose a real serious risk of doing that behavior again,' the park's spokesperson Jamie Sanders said.

'We never want bears to associate people with food.'

The cause of Madura's death is unknown and Hazel Creek trial has been closed off for investigation.

The National Parks Service describe black bears as 'dangerous and unpredictable' animals which hikers should not get within 150ft of.

There are thought to be around 1,500 black bears in the Great Smoky Mountains, males weigh 250 pounds, while females are just over 100 pounds.

The park covers 800 square miles of the southern Appalachian Mountains.
