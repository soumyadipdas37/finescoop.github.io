Hundreds of Trump supporters gathered in Oregon City, Oregon on Monday afternoon at the start of a pro-Trump convoy, before driving to Salem and scuffling with counter-protesters.

The caravan was organized a week after a member of Patriot Prayer, a pro-Trump militia, was shot and killed at the end of a similar caravan.

Aaron 'Jay' Danielson, 39, was shot and killed by Antifa supporter Michael Reinoehl, 48, on August 29, as BLM and pro-Trump sides clashed in Portland. Five days later Reinoehl was shot and killed by police investigating Danielson's killing. 



On Monday afternoon another caravan was organized - this time deliberately avoiding the tumultuous city of Portland, and heading south from their meeting point to Salem. 

Members of the Proud Boys pro-Trump group waited for the caravan to arrive in Salem, the state capital.

Supporters of Black Lives Matter were also present, waiting outside the Capitol.

Journalism students from South Salem High School, on the ground to witness the scene, said that both sides were armed - the Trump supporters with 'lots of weapons' including guns, bats, batons, knives and bear spray. 

The BLM side was armed with baseball bats, and both sides stood on opposite sidewalks, hurling insults and chants at each other.

The Proud Boys fired paint balls at one BLM protester; at least two of the pro-Trump group were arrested. 

It was unclear if any of the BLM counter-protesters were detained. 

Pro-Trump agitators used fire extinguishers on their rivals.

One BLM supporter was seen cowering beneath a shield as a man kicked him. The man then began punching the BLM protester, raining down blows from a standing position as the BLM activist curled up on the floor.

As he was punching him, another man was seen pointing a paintball gun in their direction.

Chemical irritants appeared to have been used, and one man was pictured having his eyes and face doused with water.

A heavy police presence was seen on Salem's usually-peaceful streets. 

As dusk fell members of BLM appeared to have left the scene, and an uneasy calm returned, with the flag-waving Trump supporters left chatting on the grass in front of the Capitol. 

The earlier caravan was organized on Facebook, and intended 'to show our support for our great President Donald J. Trump and keep the momentum for Trump alive in Oregon.'

Participants were told to be ready at 1pm at Clackamas Community College in Oregon City.

After an address by organizers, they set off in a convoy heading south on the 205 South, to Interstate 5 South.

'Follow the flags on cars,' the organizers posted.

Participants were told to end the 30 mile route at Woodburn, turning off the Interstate before they reached Salem.

Most did, at 3pm, but some headed into Salem city center to join the Proud Boys and their violent confrontation. 

By 6pm in Salem crowds were beginning to disperse.

Only around 100 people were left, and were heading home - honking their horns and waving their flags as they went.
