Prince Harry has a £100million Netflix deal, an £11million mansion with 14 bathrooms and Hollywood stars falling over themselves to be his friends, but is he starting to miss his former life? 

For I hear he invited one of his oldest friends to visit his home in California. 

'Court jester' Guy Pelly, who's known Harry since they were children, was joined on the visit by his wife, Elizabeth Wilson, and their three-year-old daughter, Willow. 

'They were kindly invited by Harry and Meghan,' a source tells me. 

Prince Harry (pictured alongside Meghan Markle) has a £100million Netflix deal, an £11million mansion with 14 bathrooms and Hollywood stars falling over themselves to be his friends, but is he starting to miss his former life?

'Despite what's been said about Harry losing touch with his old friends, he was keen to see Guy.' 

Pelly does have more in common with Harry than most of his old friends as Lizzy is also a member of the 'American wives' club'. 

She's from Tennessee and is an heiress to the Holiday Inn fortune. When she married Pelly in Memphis 2014, their wedding led to the end of Harry's two-year romance with actress Cressida Bonas. 

Cressida expected Harry to pay her airfare because she didn't have the money herself and felt that as Guy was his friend, not hers, the request seemed reasonable enough. Harry refused, there was a spat and they split.

Perhaps urbane former nightclub boss Pelly could act as a peacemaker between Harry and Prince William? He does share an unshakeable bond with the royal brothers. 

He organised William's stag night and is known for such antics as shimmying 40ft up a marquee during a Prince's Trust concert, stripped to his boxer shorts. 

And William asked Pelly to be godfather to Prince Louis in 2018. Pelly, who has never spoken about his friendship with the royals, declines to comment. 

This will leave you breathless! Fifty Shades Of Grey author E.L. James saw her fortune rise to £65.7million last year. 

The BBC cameraman's daughter, 57, paid herself a dividend of £3.5million — or £9,500 per day — a pay cut of 50 per cent compared with 2018. 

Newly published accounts for Fifty Shades Ltd, which channels royalties from her erotic books and film adaptations, show it made £6.3million in 2019, as opposed to £11.25million the year before. 

Born Erika Mitchell, the novelist set up the business in 2012 and runs it with husband Niall Leonard. 

Harriet Clapham (pictured) is fast becoming an influential figure in the art world

The smart set's talking about... Sotheby's chairman's arty new squeeze 

Often seen hobnobbing with the likes of Damien Hirst and sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor, Harriet Clapham is fast becoming an influential figure in the art world. 

And she's certainly made an impression on colourful Sotheby's chairman Harry Dalmeny. 

I hear that enchanting Harriet, who runs an art advisory business, is being courted by Lord Dalmeny following his split with society model Martha Sitwell last year. 'They're very serious about each other,' a friend tells me. 

Scottish property developer's daughter Harriet is a graduate of Sotheby's Art Institute and has worked at the Gagosian Gallery in Mayfair. 

To celebrate her turning 31, Harry, 52, threw her a party at his family's stately home, Dalmeny House, on the Firth of Forth in Scotland, which she described as 'the most perfect birthday weekend'. 

The Old Etonian, who has five children with his ex-wife Caroline, is known for his flair, once sporting a suit for an auction which was cut away to reveal suspenders to honour what would have been Queen singer Freddie Mercury's 65th birthday.

With foreign travel plans subject to sudden disruption, the Earl of Portsmouth is struggling to find someone to join him on a week-long horse ride across the Dolomites. 

So the twice-married earl, Quentin Wallop, 66, has taken the unusual step of advertising for a companion on the trip to Italy later this month. 

He took the drastic measure, he tells me, because all his riding friends are either 'busy, nervous of precipitous terrain or are in countries currently under lockdown'. 

Heiress Irene Forte was treated to a surprise party in London 

Big day delayed but hotel heiress Irene still has her hen-do! 

Forced to postpone her wedding because of the pandemic, Irene Forte was determined to mark the occasion nevertheless. 

The 31-year-old daughter of hotel tycoon Sir Rocco Forte was due to marry tech whizz Felix Winckler, 40. 

But with her plans scuppered, she was treated to a surprise party in London instead. 

'I was meant to be getting married in Sicily next weekend,' Irene, pictured right at the celebration, tells me.

'So my five closest friends threw me a very sweet surprise dinner/mini hen-do.'

He's the heir to Blenheim Palace and a £100million fortune, but the Duke of Marlborough's son is busy thinking about the next generation. 

I can reveal that the Marquess of Blandford, George Spencer-Churchill, 28, has become a father after his wife, interior designer Camilla Thorp, 32, gave birth to a daughter on Thursday night. 

'Everyone is delighted,' a member of the family tells me. 

The source declines to say where the baby was born. Insurance broker George's kinsman Sir Winston Churchill was born in a bedroom at Blenheim. 

The couple's daughter, who has not yet been named, won't inherit the family estate and fortune because of male primogeniture, which dictates it must go to the oldest son or closest male heir. 

X-Files Gillian shows off her new squeeze

Things must be getting serious for Sex Education star Gillian Anderson and The Crown scriptwriter Peter Morgan. 

For, in that modern rite of passage, the actress, 52, has posted online her first photograph cosying up with the celebrated screenwriter, 57, with whom she’s been living since the start of lockdown.

The picture was taken at the newly reopened Spring Restaurant in Somerset House, which Anderson praised as ‘the tastiest in London’. 

It’s good she’s keeping him well fed. Morgan once reacted furiously when his then wife, Lila, served him their children’s leftover fish fingers for supper. 

Lila recalled: ‘Peter took one look and said: “I am neither five years old nor a f * * * * * * P penguin.”’

£5m Brucie bonus for Strictly star’s widow 

Just a few months after I disclosed that Sir Bruce Forsyth’s widow, Wilnelia, had sold their beloved marital home for £5.5million, the former Miss World winner has secured a huge ‘Brucie bonus’. 

I can reveal that Lady Forsyth has been paid more than £5.1 million after the former Strictly host’s business, Bruce Forsyth Entertainments Ltd, was shut down. 

She was left in sole control of the company which managed his earnings. 

Newly published documents show she was paid an initial £4.75million in cash last December, which was topped up by a further £350,000 from a U.S. bank account two months ago.

TV legend Sir Bruce died three years ago aged 89 and Wilnelia, 62, will continue to receive royalties from his life-long show business career. 

Hard Rock gambles on The Ritz Club 

Here's some news that will shock the billionaires who used to enjoy rolling the dice at The Ritz Club. I can reveal that the owners of London’s most elegant casino have sold their gambling licence to the Hard Rock Cafe. 

The club, which was housed in the basement of The Ritz hotel, hosted stars such as Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, but it was closed before lockdown, leaving members ‘devastated’. 

The revamped casino will not reopen in the same location. 

Instead, it will be in the basement of the nearby Hard Rock Hotel, which opened last year. 

The Ritz hotel was sold by Daily Telegraph owners Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay to a Qatari investor for £750million in March. 

(Very) modern manners

What should you do when you want to fly first class but your partner doesn’t? 

Prince Andrew’s pal Caroline Stanbury, 43, was faced with this dilemma when she boarded a flight to Greece with her new Spanish toyboy, Sergio Carrallo, 25. 

The star of reality show Ladies Of London was able to sip champagne and nibble caviar in a first class cabin on the United Emirates Airlines flight from Dubai, while the former Real Madrid footballer travelled economy because he didn’t want to fork out £2,000 for the upgrade.

Insisting that Sergio isn’t bothered, Caroline, who separated from her financier husband, Cem Habib, last year, tells me: ‘It’s not his priority — he honestly doesn’t care. He thinks I am ridiculous.’
