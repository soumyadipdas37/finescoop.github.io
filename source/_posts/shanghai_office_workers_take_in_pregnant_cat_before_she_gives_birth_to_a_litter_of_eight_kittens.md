Shanghai office workers rescued a stray pregnant cat and gave her refuge inside a meeting room in their building, where she then gave birth to eight kittens. 

Employees of design consultancy Holmes & Marchant opted to take in the cat after she was seen meowing at people who walked past their building.

The feline then gave birth to eight kittens a few days later and the heartwarming tale was documented on Bored Panda by one of the employees, Angela Sy. 

Photos show the cat both before and after she gave birth, while other shots show the kittens after being born and as they got bigger.

Writing in her post, Angela revealed the mother cat first appeared outside her office building and 'rubbed her face on anyone who gave her attention'. 

Her colleague Yvonne, who first saw the cat, said it was like 'she was asking for help for her babies and herself'. 

The employees decided to take the cat in and name her Boba 'because she was so round'. 

They made her feel at home in a spare meeting room by preparing a litter box, food and a bed for her.

Angela wrote: 'She was very friendly to everyone and seemed content that she had a safe place to give birth.'

Angela said that the employees came into the office after a stormy night and Boba had given birth

She said that after a storm one night, the employees came to work and found that Boba had given birth to eight kittens - four boys and four girls.

Among the litter were five tabbies, two gingers and one calico. 

Even though the mother was exhausted from her ordeal, she still fed and cleaned her litter, Angela said.

The employees named this kitten Oat and said it is 'energetic and silly' 

Angela said that Boba was 'very friendly' while she waited to give birth and seemed 'content' that she had found somewhere safe

The employee said her colleagues come and visit the kittens and their mother and find it 'impossible' to get work done when they do

After around two weeks, Angela said the kittens began to open their eyes and after three weeks all of them had done so. 

Each of the kitten was given a name - with the two gingers being named Pudding and Milk Topping and the smallest one being given the name of No Ice (translated from Mandarin). 

After three weeks of life, the kittens started to eat on their own and at four weeks they learned to use the litter box. 

At around the same time, Angela and her colleagues moved the cats to a bigger meeting room so they could all roam more freely. 

The plan now is for Boba to be spayed so she cannot have any more kittens and then try to find someone to adopt the mother with at least one of her offspring.

The employees named this kitten Grass Jelly (translated from Mandarin) and said she was the 'biggest of the bunch'
