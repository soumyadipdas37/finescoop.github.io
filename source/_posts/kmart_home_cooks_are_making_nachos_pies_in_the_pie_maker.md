Home cooks are making loaded nachos pies in their $29 Kmart pie maker - complete with mini tortillas and mince, topped with cheese, guacamole and sour cream.

Many Australians have shared pictures of their tasty creations on social media after using the budget gadget to whip up the Mexican-inspired meals in just minutes.

One mother said she turned tortilla wraps into mini cups so she could fill them with cooked mince beef with nacho spice mix, topped with cheese.

Once the bases have crisped up and the cheese have melted, she added guacamole, salsa and a dollop of sour cream.

'Not sure if anyone has made these before and excuse the messy pie maker, this was the third batch. I cut out circles from tortilla wraps and added nacho mince to them and a sprinkle of cheese on top,' she said.

'Once they were cooked we added guacamole, salsa and sour cream... Not everyone's going to like the idea but the kids loved them.'

Many responded to thread, saying they have been creating similar nachos pies at home, with their own ingredients such as wonton sheets used as the base.

'Wonton nachos what a winner,' one woman said.

To make her wonton version, she placed two sheets of wonton in each plate of the pie maker, then added grated cheese, cooked beef mince with taco mix, topped with more cheese then cooked for eight to 10 minutes until golden brown. 

'Then add guacamole and sour cream on top [to serve]! So easy and delicious,' the woman said.

Another woman said the nachos pies were a huge hit at dinner after she added a side of corn chips.

'Base was a mini tortilla, with a standard mince and taco sauce mix with tomato pasta sauce mix. Top with mozzarella and add corn chips on the side.

One home cook created 'nachos open top pies' using leftover spaghetti bolognese.

'I used leftover spaghetti bolognese with red wine and fennel seeds, added kidney beans and taco seasoning and put short crust store-bought pastry as bases,' she said.

'Then I added cheese on top of pies in the pie maker, topped with corn chips, sour cream and avocado dip (homemade guacamole would be better). Not super fancy but very easy to make.'

Hundreds of people were amazed at easy the meals are to make, while others said they couldn't wait to try it out themselves.
