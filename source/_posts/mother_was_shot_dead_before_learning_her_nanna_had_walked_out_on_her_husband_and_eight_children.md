Daphne Pearl Hampstead (pictured) left her Sydney home in 1958 and lived a secret life in Queensland until her death in 2007

The 'granddaughter' of a mother who abandoned her Sydney family and forged a secret new life in Queensland  for six decades was shot dead last year.

Megan Kirley knew Daphne Jones as 'nanna' and inherited a share of her home at Maryborough on the Fraser Coast when she died in 2007, supposedly aged 83. 

What Megan did not know was that Daphne was a widow six years older than she claimed and had walked out on her husband and eight children in 1958. 

Megan kept a poem given to her by Daphne on her fridge which began: 'Don't count how many years you've spent, Just count the good you've done.'

The mother-of-two posted the verse to Facebook five years ago with the caption: 'This was my beautiful nanna's poem - that's the essence xo.'

The poem, titled What to Count, was attributed to 'Daphne Pearl Jones' but she did not write it and that was not her real name. 

Last year, before Megan learnt of Daphne's secret past and her other family, she was killed on a semi-rural property at Karawatha, south-east of Brisbane. 

The 40-year-old's body was found at the Wembley Road address just after 3am on Saturday, February 9. She had been shot once in the head.

Megan Kirley kept a touching poem given to her by Daphne on her fridge which began: 'Don't count how many years you've spent, Just count the good you've done.' She posted the poem to Facebook five years ago with the caption 'This was my beautiful nanna's poem'

Three men and a woman have been charged with murder and another man with attempted robbery with violence whilst armed in company. 

All will face a committal hearing at Brisbane Magistrates Court on November 18. 

The poem on Megan's fridge ends: 'Count your deeds of kindness, the smiles not the tears; count all the pleasures that you've had, but never count the years.'  

Megan Kirley's links to Daphne are the latest twist in the extraordinary tale of a woman who was widely loved but managed to officially stay missing for 62 years. 

Daphne was born Daphne Pearl Jones at Cootamundra in the New South Wales Riverina on July 13 or 15, 1918, and married local boy Sidney Hampstead in 1936.

The couple eventually had eight children: Leslie, Patricia, Marcia, Daphne, twins Barry and Clifford, Helen, and Janet.

They lived at Cootamundra, Tumut, Grafton, Taree, Oxley Island and Muswellbrook where they worked as share farmers before buying their own farm at Scone. 

Megan Kirley inherited a share of Daphne's home (pictured) at Maryborough on the Fraser Coast when she died in 2007, supposedly aged 83. Megan did not know Daphne's real surname was Hampstead and she had walked out on her husband and eight children 49 years earlier

Two days after Daphne disappeared a letter in her handwriting arrived at his western Sydney home. 'My darling Sid,' the 39-year-old began the note. 'Oh darling what it is costing me to write this letter, you will never know.' The letter's words are reproduced in this image

Financial difficulties forced the family to move to a dairy at Bossley Park in Sydney's western suburbs in 1956. Two years later Daphne disappeared.

Deputy State Coroner Elaine Truscott outlined what was happening in the Hampstead home as she finally solved the riddle of Daphne's disappearance this week.  

'Daphne was a loving mother who enjoyed cooking and was apparently social and engaging,' Ms Truscutt found. 

'Daphne and Sidney are described to have had a loving relationship however Sidney was possessive and jealous and violent to Daphne.

'After leaving the farm in Scone and moving to Bossley Park the domestic violence became more frequent.' 

Shortly before dawn on May 10, 1958, Daphne caught a taxi from the farm carrying photographs and most of her clothes.

Two days later her husband received a letter written in Daphne's hand inside an envelope with a postmark from nearby Fairfield.

On Wednesday NSW Deputy State Coroner Elaine Ms Truscott (pictured right alongside former homicide detective Gary Jubilen) found Daphne Hampstead, Daphne Onslow, Daphne Shaw and Daphne Jones were the same person

'My darling Sid,' she began. 'Oh darling what it is costing me to write this letter, you will never know.

'I left work today, I just can't go on. I thought there was no love left at home for me at all. But I have realised how wrong I was over the last week. 

'I think it has been a week I shall never forget. I am going away for a while (by myself) don't worry about me, I will be okay.

'I know now I can always come to you for understanding I do wish I had known that before dear.' 

Daphne also sent a letter to her daughter Daphne Lillian asking her to look after her father and her younger brothers and sisters. 

Five years later Daphne somehow learned one of her twin sons, 19-year-old Barry, was critically ill in hospital and wrote him a letter postmarked from Wyong on the NSW Central Coast.

She expressed concern for her son but indicated she could not visit him, although she signed off 'from someone who loves you very much'. 

Sidney fell into heavy drinking and moved in with daughters Daphne Lillian then Marcia while Daphne reinvented herself.   

Daphne took the surname Onslow, took six years off her age and after possibly spending time in Papua New Guinea moved to Queensland. 

She lived with plantation farmer Roy Shaw from at least 1963 when the couple lived in Brisbane and she began using his surname. 

Roy Shaw died in 1972 and Daphne moved on with his close friend Raymond Jones whose wife Vona had died the same year. 

Following a 'celebration' of her relationship with Ray Jones in 1973 - the year her husband Sidney died - Daphne took his name and became stepmother to his daughter Diann.

The couple lived at several locations across Queensland before moving to Maryborough on the Fraser Coast in 2003, a year before Ray died of a heart attack aged 74.

Daphne spent her last years living in Steindl Street, Granville, an eastern suburb of Maryborough, until she died of cancer at the local hospital on November 2, 2007. 

All the while her whereabouts remained a mystery to her original Hampstead family.  

A 2012 coronial inquiry into Daphne's disappearance found she was likely dead but it could not be determined how or when she died.

One of Daphne's granddaughters, Donna Gough, hired private investigator Luke Athens (pictured), who solved the six-decades-long mystery in just '12 billable hours'

Daphne Lillian's daughter Donna Gough then hired private investigator Luke Athens, who within hours had worked out she had changed her name and age after moving to Queensland.

Daphne had never married Ray Jones but upon her death his daughter Diann and her husband Tyrone Green were listed as her next of kin.

Diann was one of five family members who originally inherited the brick house at Granville which was sold for $137,500 in November 2009. 

Another of those relatives was her 'granddaughter' Megan Kirley, who has shot dead last year.

Luke Athens put Donna Gough in touch with the Greens, who told her that Daphne disliked talking about her past but had a 'magnetic, charismatic personality'.  

The two families compared pictures of Daphne Hampstead and Daphne Jones and agreed they were of the same woman. 

The Greens had made statements to the coroner in which they said Daphne had talked of having twin sons but mentioned no other children.

'She was very guarded about her history,' Ms Truscott found.

'Diann reports that in 2006 she saw that Daphne was using a paper shredder and remarks that this was consistent with her experience that Daphne would destroy all things about her past.'

Mr Jones's daughter Diann and her husband Tyrone Green were listed as Daphne's next of kin when she died of cancer at Maryborough Hospital on November 7, 2007 aged 89

The Greens' daughter told Daily Mail Australia her parents did not wish to discuss Daphne's separate lives publicly. 

'Mum and dad aren't interested,' she said. 'They just want to leave it.'

On Wednesday Ms Truscott found Daphne Hampstead, Daphne Onslow, Daphne Shaw and Daphne Jones were the same person. 

'I note that the notice of Daphne's death exhibited in the newspaper indicated that she was the beloved wife of the late Roy Jones,' she said in her findings.

'Loved mother and mother-in-law of Diann and Tyrone, Ted, Esme (deceased) and Theresa (deceased). The loved Nana of 7 and Great nana of 10.

'Added to that she was the mother of eight and grandmother and great grandmother from her NSW family.

'I hope having the record adjusted to reflect that Daphne's death is properly recorded in some way brings a sense of completeness to both Daphne Pearl's NSW and Queensland families.'
