She has a whopping four directorial projects in the pipeline.

Yet Olivia Wilde, 36, managed to find some downtime on Wednesday as he frolicked on the beach with her fiancé Jason Sudekis, 44. 

Having a kick about on the sand, the pair looked in high spirits on the outing.

Olivia looked sensational as she slipped into a black halterneck one-piece with a scalloped edge by Marysia. 

The mother-of-two wrapped a striped shirt around her waist and accessorised with a beach hat and dainty gold pendant. 

Not present for the beach outing were the couple's son Otis, six, or daughter Daisy, three.

Olivia will no doubt be making the most of any family time as she juggles four major projects.  

The Tron: Legacy actress made her directorial debut last year with high school comedy Booksmart and has clearly developed a taste for working behind the camera. 

Her next project, Don't Worry, Darling - a psychological thriller about a 1950s housewife - is in pre-production.

The film has already generated a lot of buzz, with Harry Styles, Dakota Johnson, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine signed on to star.

Olivia will also direct Perfect, a biopic about gymnast Kerri Strug for Searchlight Pictures and an untitled holiday-comedy film for Universal Pictures.  

She was recently announced to direct an upcoming female-led Marvel film for Sony Pictures, which some believe will be a Spider-Woman movie. 

No character details have been revealed, but Olivia dropped a hint when she tweeted the news with a spider emoji.
