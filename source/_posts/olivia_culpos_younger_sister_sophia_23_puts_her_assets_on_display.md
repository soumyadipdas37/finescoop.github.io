Sophia Culpo is giving famous older sister Olivia Culpo a run for her money. 

On Monday the lookalike younger sister to model and former Miss Universe winner, Olivia, 28, was spotted enjoying her day at the beach as she stunned in a red bikini while in Venice, California. 

The 23-year-old aspiring model and influencer looked flawless as she descended upon the ocean with friends in an attempt to beat the Los Angeles heat.

Sophia looked fresh out of Baywatch as she put on quite the eye-popping display while dipping her toes into the water.

The brunette beauty sported a red high rise bikini as she enjoyed the pacific ocean, her tiny top rising up to reveal a hint of underboob and her flat stomach.

The former college student's skimpy bikini put her ample assets on display, the tiny bottoms hitting just above her hips as she flashed a bit of her toned backside.

For her day at the beach the stunner opted for a natural look, tying her short brown locks into a low bun as she rocked a pair of black sunglasses and enjoyed herself. 

Sophia made sure to keep a mask on hand as she tied a black face covering around her wrist to protect herself.  

The Rhode Island native recently relocated to California as she has been spending part of her quarantine in Los Angeles with her sister Olivia.
