Kepa Arrizabalaga wants to fight for his Chelsea future.

The £71.6million goalkeeper appeared to be heading for the exit this summer after he was left out of the squad for the FA Cup final and a Champions League clash at Bayern Munich. 

Chelsea have been linked with several goalkeepers over the summer including Edouard Mendy, Nick Pope, Dean Henderson and Jan Oblak.

But Frank Lampard has instead splashed out £136million on Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva.

Kepa is now convinced his best option is to stay put rather than seek a move from Stamford Bridge, according to the Sun.

The 25-year-old still has four years left on a £150,000-a-week contract and Chelsea would want to recoup at least £50m of their transfer fee back. This has put off clubs offering him a way out.

Kepa played 45 minutes of Saturday’s 1-1 friendly draw at Brighton.
