It's the most basic of parental duties but the mother of a Sydney five-year-old allegedly beaten to 'within an inch of his life' is accused of a hideous betrayal. 

Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal grim details of the case against a Cabramatta mum, 31, who was found with her injured son at home late last month. 

Court documents reveal the mother, who cannot be named, is accused of failing to get her son 'appropriate medical attention'.

That's after he had allegedly suffered 'significant and persistent physical harm and abuse' over a period of up to two months. 

The details of how police allege the mother let the boy down can be revealed as she was hit with a fresh charge on Wednesday of intentionally wounding the boy.

Her boyfriend, 20, has been accused of the same offence, with police to allege in court that he beat the child with a stick or wooden pole. 

The injured boy is pictured with his parents on his second birthday. The mother and father have long been estranged from one another

A picture, which a source said was uploaded years ago, has been leaked from the woman's social media pages. It prompted a friend to ask 'what's happened with his face?'

'House of horrors': Police were called to the mother's home in Cabramatta after a commotion on Friday August 28

As the mother was refused bail at court on Wednesday for the brief of evidence to be served, it can be revealed questions have been raised about the boy before.

A photo leaked to Daily Mail Australia from the woman's now-deleted social media pages shows the boy with several scratches or scabs on his head two years' ago. 

The picture prompted a friend to ask in Vietnamese 'what's happened with his face', but the mother did not publicly reply. 

It is not suggested that the marks were necessarily caused by abuse, neglect or wrongdoing.

The boy was found at his mother's red brick rental about 9.50pm on Friday, August 28 in a critical condition. 

He was taken to hospital where he was placed on life support. 

It took five days for the boy to wake up at Westmead Children's Hospital, with loved ones crowing that it was a 'miracle' he was alive.

'I couldn't imagine how (the father) would be if he lost him, he means the absolute world to him,' one source said.

Piles of water bottles, Red Bull and coconut drink were heaped together in the mother's yard

Police confirmed on Wednesday that the boy is still in the care of doctors, some twelve days after he was found. 

But he is in a stable condition, with the boy's father constantly by his side. 

The boy's father and mother have been estranged for some time, with both moving on with new partners in the past two years.

'I miss and love you so much', the father captioned a picture of his son on Facebook in 2018, after his relationship with the mother fizzled.   

Meanwhile, the boy's mother presented herself to friends as a doting parent who lavished her son with toys.

She described the child as her 'prince' on Facebook and said she hoped he grew up to be 'obedient and smart.' 

'You are all of my life,' she said.

The mother did not apply for bail at Liverpool Local Court on Wednesday and it was formally refused. 

She will return to court in October. Her boyfriend has also been refused bail.
