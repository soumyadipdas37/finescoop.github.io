Commander Kyle Gordon, the lead for the Met's firearms operations, said: 'Any operation where there may be firearms involved requires a lot of planning and a lot of specialist assets.

'As well as the local safer neighbourhood teams and officers that are leading this operation, of course we have our specialist firearms command involved, and a number of public order assets as well.'
