Britain is set for a last blast of summer with a heatwave which will see parts of the country bask in temperatures hotter than the Bahamas.

Temperatures in southern England could reach 29C (84F) on Monday and rise as high as 31C (88F) by Tuesday – exceeding the forecast 29C in the Bahamas on Monday and Tuesday. 

Further north, the West Midlands is set to reach 28C (82F), while 24C or 25C (75-77F) is expected in northern England.

It compares with a seasonal average daytime temperature of 18C (64F) for England and Wales in September.

A maximum of 22C (72F) is expected in southern areas and 18-19C (64-66F) further north today. 

Tomorrow, temperatures could reach 25C in South East England. 

In Wales, parts of Snowdonia are predicted to hit 25C (77F), and in Newcastle-upon-Tyne 23C (73F) is forecast for Monday. 

Temperatures in southern England could reach 29C (84F) on Monday and rise as high as 31C (88F) by Tuesday. A man jumps from the jetty into the sea in Brighton, on the south coast of England, amid an earlier heatwave in August

Bonnie Diamond of the Meteorological Office said there may be thunderstorms on Wednesday as cooler air attempts to move in from the west.

But she added: ‘Warmer weather could stay around for the rest of the week in the southern and eastern half of the country.’

It’s a different story in Scotland, where a washout weekend is expected. 

A weather warning has been issued for the western half of Scotland from this evening until the end of tomorrow, when up to 150mm (almost six inches) of rain is forecast.

The monthly average for September in that region is 155mm (6.1in).
