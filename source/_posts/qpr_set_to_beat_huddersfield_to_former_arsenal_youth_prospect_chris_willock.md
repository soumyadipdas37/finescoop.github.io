QPR have moved into pole position to sign Benfica's former Arsenal prospect Chris Willock.

Benfica accepted an offer from Huddersfield for the 22 year-old winger but they have been unable to finalise his personal terms.

QPR have now also reached a deal with the Portuguese club worth an initial £750,000, with further add-ons to come, and are hoping to agree terms with the player.

Benfica had accepted an offer from Huddersfield Town for the 22 year-old winger

Willock spent the second half of last season on loan at Huddersfield and they were keen to make the move permanent.

But the door remained open for his rival suitors, including QPR, who were also monitoring the situation while Huddersfield attempted to negotiate his contract.

Willock, who played for England from Under 16 through to U 20 level, made 14 appearances for Huddersfield, including eight starts, scoring twice. 

Willock started out in Arsenal's youth ranks before moving to Benfica in the summer of 2017

Willock is the brother of current Arsenal midfielder Joe, 21, and Gillingham midfielder Matty, 24, with all three starting out in the Gunners' youth ranks. 

Chris made two first team appearances in the League Cup in 2016 before being snapped up by Benfica the following summer, making 64 appearances for their B-team in Portugal's second tier, scoring 14 times and recording nine assists. 

Willock began last season on loan at West Brom before joining Huddersfield in January.
