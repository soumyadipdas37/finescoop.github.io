The Essex starlet received criticism for sharing a throwback picture with her ex-boyfriend last week, after some fans thought it was disrespectful, given he is now married to Michelle Keegan.   

Childhood sweethearts Lauren and Mark, became engaged on the reality show, after both starring since its inauguration in 2010, and they were a couple for 11 years before suffering an extremely acrimonious break-up in 2012. 

Despite leaving on bad terms, Lauren shared a slew of throwback snaps- including a red carpet picture with Mark- to celebrate the 10 year anniversary special of TOWIE.

The reality star took to Instagram to thank the famous show for providing her with meaningful 'memories' and insisted she's 'proud' of all her castmates.

Lauren wrote in the accompanying caption: '10 years ago changed my life we created a show called "the only way is Essex" I was 22 when I first started filming and what an amazing journey this has been !! 

 'I put my life on national television and we won a BAFTA - not a lot people can say that! You've seen me laugh, cry, engaged, break ups and make ups ! I've grown up on the screens and it was all real!

'Congratulations to all the OGs @towie these images are from google thank you for memories and well to all my costars im proud of you all and always will be.' (sic)

Following their split, Mark went on to tie the knot in a lavish ceremony with Michelle, 33, in May 2015.

Lauren previously branded their marriage 'weird' and claimed they don't speak to each other.

Speaking to Heat Magazine, she said: 'I saw them both in the gym. They don't talk it's really weird. I was like 'F**king hell, we weren't like that'. It's like they don't know each other. I can't go into that though. I'm just so glad that ain't me'.
