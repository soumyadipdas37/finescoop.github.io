He's going through a high-profile split from wife Megan Fox. 

And on Thursday, Brian Austin Green shared a snap to his Instagram of himself and his three kids riding in a car.

The arty snap was taken using the rear view mirror and in the caption, the former Beverly Hills, 90210 star wrote in the caption: 'Target run!!!'

''Target run!!!' Brian Austin Green, 47, shared a snap to his Instagram Thursday of himself and his three kids riding in a car as they headed to a store amid split drama with Megan Fox

In the snap, the three boys can be seen strapped into the vehicle with orange seat belts.

Green, like perhaps many a parent heading to Target with their young children, appeared to have a somewhat stressed look as he posed for the pic while at the steering wheel.

The 47-year-old shares Noah, who turns eight later this month, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four, with Transformers star Fox, 34.

The now estranged couple had started dating after meeting on the set of a TV sitcom in 2004. Following an on-off-on again engagement, the pair tied the knot in 2010.

Fox, 34, split from Green after meeting rapper Machine Gun Kelly, 30, on the set of the movie Midnight In The Switchgrass. 

They went public with their romance in May. 

The couple made things Instagram official with a black-and-white mirror selfie and Kelly posted it with the caption: 'Waited for eternity to find you again ...'

Fox took to her own Instagram, writing: 'Achingly Beautiful Boy... My heart is yours.

She later appeared as a crazy girlfriend in the music video for the rapper's single Bloody Valentine from his upcoming fifth studio album Tickets to My Downfall, which drops September 25.

In an Instagram Live video last month, Green appeared somewhat upbeat about his marital woes. 

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he explained.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he said. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'   

Green continued: 'I’m on my path doing what I feel I need to do to be happy and it’s not for a lack of love for the kids or lack of being responsible, it’s really important to take care of yourself. t’s important for us as parents to take care of ourselves. I wish her all the best and I wish myself the best as well.' 

Staying positive: In an Instagram Live video last month, Green appeared somewhat upbeat about his marital woes and didn't rule out the possibility of a reconciliation with Fox
