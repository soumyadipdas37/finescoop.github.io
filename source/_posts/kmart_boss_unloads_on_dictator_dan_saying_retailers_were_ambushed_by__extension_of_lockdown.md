The boss of Kmart has hit out at Premier Dan Andrew, saying retailers were ambushed by the 'massive extension' of Victoria's lockdown. 

Premier Andrews announced on Sunday that the state's strict shutdown would be extended by two weeks, with retailers barred from reopening until October 26 at the earliest. 

Ian Bailey, Managing Director of Kmart Group, said the retail sector had not been consulted on the plans and the 'extended forced closures' had left staff 'concerned and frustrated'. 

'The Victorian Government’s roadmap for re-opening the state economy took the retail sector and Kmart Group by complete surprise,' he wrote in a statement.

Ian Bailey, Managing Director of Kmart Group, said the Andrews' government did not consult the retail sector before imposing an 'extended forced closure' of its stores

Premier Andrews on Sunday announced that non-essential businesses would not be permitted to open until October 26  at the earliest

'We were not provided with any forewarning in relation to the massive extension to the continued closure of retail trading that was announced.

'Best case scenarios will see our stores closed in metro Melbourne for a minimum of 12 weeks. This is unprecedented for the Kmart Group – and retail trading – in Melbourne. ' 

He promised that the discount chain would pay its staff who 'through no fault of their own' are unable to work.  

Mr Andrews' 'roadmap to reopening' will see some restrictions ease from September 13, but only essential businesses, such as supermarkets, chemists, petrol stations and bottle shops are permitted to operate until October 26.

The strict outline dashed hopes that retailers with a COVID-19 plan would be allowed to open sooner. 

The politician aims to only have five or less new COVID-19 cases a day before reopening a state, a goal that has been slammed by fellow MPs, including the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, as being unrealistic.

'The plan that was outlined yesterday, I hope, is a worst-case scenario,' Mr  Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday. 

'Under the thresholds that have been set in that plan, Sydney would be under curfew now.'

Kmart has pledged to continue paying staff who 'through no fault of their own' are unable to work

Kmart Group, which also owns Target and Catch, has been paying all of its permanent staff their normal wages since Melbourne entered lockdown on August 2. 

Casual staff who regularly work 12 hours a week are being paid the equivalent of their regular hours.  

Critics of Premier Andrews have taken to calling him 'Dictator Dan' because of his hardline coronavirus restrictions. 

Mr Bailey urged the Victorian government to take a 'holistic approach'.

'We will continue to encourage the Government to support all businesses and individuals that have sacrificed so much during this pandemic.'

Kmart home deliveries and click and collect services will continue while stores remain closed.  

Step one: The first step will come in to place on September 13.

Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. 

Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.

Step four: The move to step four will come when there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on November 23.
