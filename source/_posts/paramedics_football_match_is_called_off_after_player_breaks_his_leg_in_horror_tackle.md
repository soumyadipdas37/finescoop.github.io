A 'brawl' between rival paramedic football teams ended when one of the players' legs was broken, it has been reported. 

The match between the West Midlands and North West Ambulance Services abruptly ended in the first half after a 'brutal tackle' on North West's Rich Thorpe.

Mr Thorpe's leg was broken - sparking 'half an hour' of chaos and ending the game in Ashton-under-Lyne in the 39th minute on Friday, reported The Sun.

A witness said: 'It looked like a brawl was going to kick off.

'The ref tried to calm them down but had to call it off. It wasn't a great advert for our emergency services.'

A Manchester medic tweeted: 'You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Breaking someone's leg, then kicking off.' 

A spokesman for West Midland's Ambulance Service denied there was a 'brawl' and said it was raising money as a gesture of 'goodwill' for its opposing team.

They added: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service’s Black Country FC played their first match of the Emergency Service Football League season against North West Ambulance Service GMFC on Friday in Manchester. 

'Sadly, a NWAS player sustained a serious injury in the first half and the match was abandoned. 

'The football team is in the process of raising money to donate to the NWAS player as a token of good will. The Trust wishes the player a speedy recovery.'

MailOnline has approached North West Ambulance Service for comment. 

Prison officers, cops and firefighters also compete in the newly launched league.
