Not even the most loyal and ardent fans of Question Of Sport could argue that it lies at the cutting edge of television.

Unthreatening and generous of spirit, perhaps a little worn around the sides, it sits in the schedules like a comfortable living room chair in which to slump.

During uncertain times like these such things have added value: the cheery enthusiasm of Sue Barker, the faux-cockney riffs of Phil Tufnell, Matt Dawson trying not to be too competitive.

Sue Barker says she it 'would have been tough' for her to walk away from A Question of Sport

What happened next?

The high-ups at the Beeb decided it was the latest target in the never-ending cycle of renewal, in pursuit of the younger audience it is forever trying to chase.

In this age of Netflix, Amazon, Apps, social media et al they may be a chimera anyway. 

Barker, trooper and outstanding professional that she is, will take it on the chin. Many will be relieved that she will continue to host Wimbledon, with her combination of credibility and affability. 

Yet there is bound to be a little hurt in there, too. 'I love the show so much they would have to remove me, it would have been tough for me to walk away,' she told Sportsmail on Sunday.

In the current political climate the corporation faces much graver issues than quiz show personnel, but it is still a risky time to be fiddling with such an established audience favourite. 

The carefully-crafted press release almost seemed to acknowledge that, in paying tribute to an outgoing trio who have been removed in one fell swoop: 'Together they have ensured A Question of Sport remains a firm favourite with the BBC One audience,' it read. 

This is no mean achievement, and it will not make life any easier for those who replace them. 

Some would say the Beeb have developed a disarming habit of making changes in sport for the sake of them, which baffles its devotees. 

While QOS qualifies more as light entertainment (as does SPOTY nowadays) serious fans are still smarting at the loss of authoritative voices such as Cornelius Lysaght, Alan Green, Garry Richardson and Jonathan Overend on the radio. 

Barker's departure is the latest example of the BBC's clamour to cater for a younger audience



Those bemused at their departures will not be the exact same constituency as those discomfited by the exit of Barker and her two captains, at this rather unnerving time in our history. 

There should also be some acknowledgement that everything needs freshening up in life at times, and that QOS does not having the pulling power that it once did. 

Its first episode back in 1970, presided over by David Vine with Henry Cooper and Cliff Morgan as captains, is an illustration. 

The guests on that day were distinctly A-list compared to those who can make it to the Manchester studio these days. They were Lilian Board (a hugely popular athlete who would tragically pass away later that year), George Best (enough said), Ray Illingworth (then England cricket captain) and Tom Finney (all-time great footballer). 

And, with echoes of the Beeb’s wider issues in sport, the overhaul will presumably not be able to compete with Sky’s rival League Of Their Own, with its bigger budget and more modern feel.  

So there will have to be some innovative thinking to make the changes work.

While the replacement line-up is not yet known it is sure to be younger and more diverse. It would be no surprise if a prominent role were to be found for the bright and amusing Sam Quek, former GB Hockey gold medallist. 

Whether the shake-up will salve the irritation of the programme’s loyal following remains to be seen.

With the nation’s tectonic plates already shifting due to Brexit and Covid, it might all be too much to take.
