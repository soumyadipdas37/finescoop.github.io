Rumours are swirling that The Veronicas will be on the judging panel for next year's season of The Voice Australia on Channel Seven.

But not all viewers are thrilled by the idea of twins Lisa and Jessica Origliasso, 35, replacing the current coaches on the program.

Fans flocked to Facebook earlier this week, begging Seven to consider other local singers for the 2021 series.

'It's gone from bad to worse!' Rumours are swirling that The Veronicas will be on the judging panel for next year's season of The Voice on Channel Seven - but not everyone is happy

'Who wants to see The Veronicas?' Fans flocked to Facebook earlier this week, begging Seven to consider other local singers for the 2021 series

Seven has confirmed that its version of The Voice Australia in 2021 will be a 'more efficient and cost-effective production' than the show produced by Nine.

As a result, it's believed next year's panel will not feature any international stars, and will instead consist solely of local musicians. 

When reports surfaced on Monday that Seven was potentially considering The Veronicas, longtime fans of the show were less than impressed.

'The Veronicas, seriously?' one furious viewer wrote, as others pleaded: 'Please not the Veronicas!'

'Surely they can do better': Angry viewers suggested there must be 'better options' available

'It's gone from bad to worse,' one viewer said of the proposed changes, as others insisted they felt sorry for longtime judge Delta Goodrem. 

Meanwhile, several commenters suggested there must be 'better options' available.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Veronicas and Channel Seven for comment.

Seven is yet to confirm what will happen to incumbent Aussie judges Guy Sebastian and Delta Goodrem.

Delta, 35, is the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, having joined the line-up for its debut season in 2012.

It was reported last month that Nine had 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'. 

Channel Seven's CEO, James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

Warburton already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.

 

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.
