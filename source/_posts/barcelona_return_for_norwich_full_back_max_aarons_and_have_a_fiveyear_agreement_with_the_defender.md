Barcelona have made fresh contact with Norwich over right back Max Aarons and have reportedly already agreed a five-year contract with the defender.

The LaLiga side are said to already have a five-year agreement with the 20-year-old defender

Norwich would reportedly accept a loan deal for this season as long as a permanent transfer was agreed for the end of the campaign.

Ronald Koeman is a fan of the 20-year-old after watching him in action last season and is now the Dutchman's preferred option with Dest set to join Bayern.

Aarons played in all 36 Premier League games for Norwich last season and covered more distance than Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold.

His passing accuracy in the final third was one of the highest among the league's full backs despite his side finishing the season bottom of the table.

The defender has played in both of Norwih's Championship fixtures this season which have included a draw against Preston and a victory over Huddersfield.

Aarons has also been linked with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen but it is understood his preference is to complete a move to the Nou Camp.
