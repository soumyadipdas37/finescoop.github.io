It has a hauntingly expressive violin solo that can make your hairs stand on end. And now the score for Schindler's List has been voted the nation's favourite film music. 

John Williams won an Oscar for his accompaniment to Steven Spielberg's 1993 film, about a German businessman who saved more than 1,000 Jewish people during the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler was played by Liam Neeson. 

The music also knocked Howard Shore's Lord Of The Rings score off the top spot.

Hans Zimmer's Gladiator came third in the poll run by Classic FM and Radio Times. 

When Williams, 88, first saw Schindler's List, he is said to have told Spielberg: 'You need a better composer than I am for this film.' Spielberg replied: 'I know. But they're all dead!' 

Andrew Collins, Classic FM presenter and Radio Times film editor, said: 'We have found your favourite film theme and it's as moving and mournful as any winner. 

'Williams doubted he could pull it off. He was wrong.' 

Italian composer Ennio Morricone had three entries in the top 20 – The Mission, Cinema Paradiso and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly – following his death in July aged 91. 

The music also knocked Howard Shore's Lord Of The Rings score off the top spot. Pictured: Schindler's List
