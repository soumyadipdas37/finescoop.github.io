They hold the titles of two of Hollywood's most favorite stars.

And Reese Witherspoon sent fans into a frenzy after sharing a fresh-faced throwback from 1996 with Paul Rudd to Instagram on Tuesday. 

The 44-year-old actress appeared to barely age a day — much like her counterpart — to which fans could barely believe their eyes.

'Wait a second... did Paul Rudd and I take the 'Selfie' in 1996,' she asked her 24million followers.  

With a swipe of cherry red lipstick and shimmering blue shadow, 20-year-old Reese smiled at the camera.

Paul, who would have been around 27-years-old in the photo, flashed a toothy smile next to the up-and-coming star. 

Poking fun at the selfie founder title, Reese did not mention that Paris Hilton has long claimed she invented the selfie in 2006. 

Obvious answer! Popular blogger Sarah Landry of @TheBirdsPapaya wrote: 'This is confirmation that Paul Rudd indeed has a time machine'

Lena Waithe noted that Reese was 'always ahead of your time' while Selma Blair joked: 'I'm in love with this relic fit for the smithsonian.'

They joined forces once again in 2010 to star in How Do You Know, which also featured Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson.
