Alexis Sanchez revealed he wanted to leave Manchester United after one training session following his move from Arsenal in 2018.

The Chilean endured a nightmare spell at Old Trafford, despite the Red Devils paying him around £560,000-a-week. He scored just five goals in 45 matches before moving to Inter Milan on loan for the 2019-20 season, a move which he made permanent last summer. 

And the 31-year-old, who confirmed an Manchester City fell through before he joined United, revealed that he asked to move back to former club Arsenal after just one day of training under Jose Mourinho.

'They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It had already been signed.' 

Sanchez recalled one moment at Manchester United when he was left out of the matchday squad by Mourinho for a game against West Ham in September 2018. 

It was an incredible fall from grace for the Chilean winger, who just nine months ago was one of the most dangerous attacking players in England's top-flight while at Arsenal.

The Chilean said: 'In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked. That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible. 

'To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playingin five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift, because I love what I do.'

Manchester United lost the West Ham game 3-1 and Mourinho was sacked just months later with the Red Devils languishing in mid-table. Sanchez then took the opportunity to speak to his successor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, about a move away.

Sanchez added: 'Then the next coach arrived, the current one, and I decided to talk to him. I told him that I needed to take a breather, and the opportunity to go to Inter. He told me that yes, there was no problem.'  

The winger, who scored 80 goals in 166 matches at Arsenal before moving to Old Trafford in a swap for Henrikh Mhkitaryan in January 2018, admitted the comments made by certain media outlets made him angry during his time at Old Trafford.

He said: 'Journalists spoke without knowing and it bothered me, it hurt. Former players spoke who had no idea of ​​anything that was happening inside the club and gave their opinion damaging you, that it was your fault.

'Since they had to blame one, they blamed me.' 

Sanchez ended the video by revealing he wanted his time at Manchester United to work out, but he has grown from the situation.

'I only have words of thanks to United for giving me the opportunity to defend the shirt,' said Sanchez. 'It bothered me that things did not go the way I wanted. 

'If the atmosphere had been more positive, it would have turned out differently. I tell it all now because I have already passed a period of learning as a player and a person. I would have liked to win everything.'
