Victoria has recorded just 37 new coronavirus cases and six deaths as the premier's top advisor calls for the state's strict lockdown to be eased.

The infections reported on Saturday mark the ninth day of double digit daily increases.

The additional fatalities take the state death toll to 716 and the national figure to 803. 

Paul Little, the chairman of Andrews' government's own COVID-19 Advisory Group, said the state's coronavirus restrictions created 'unintended consequences'.

'Most of the industry and community contacts I have spoken to recently agree that using a 'blunt tool' of minimising social interaction throughout Victoria has created many unintended consequences,' he told AFR Weekend.

'In my advisory capacity as chair of the Victorian COVID-19 Advisory Group, we supply real time intelligence from key community and business sectors and feed this information back into government strategic decision makers for further action.'
