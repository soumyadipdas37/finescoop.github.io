She's the self-proclaimed love coach who briefly appeared on Matty 'J' Johnson's season of The Bachelor.

And now Belinda 'Love' Rygier is eyeing a return to the spotlight as a relationship expert on the next season of Married At First Sight.'

The 37-year-old put her hand up for the gig after Dr Trisha Stratford announced her departure from the series on Wednesday.

Commenting on Trisha's retirement post, Belinda wrote: 'Good luck Trisha, what a journey you've been on!'

She added: 'Not to be insensitive, if you are looking for someone to step in I'm available.'

Back in 2018, Belinda revealed that she had considered applying for MAFS as a bride, but had changed her mind after seeing Davina Rankin's cheating scandal with Dean Wells.

In a blog post at the time, she wrote: 'After failing to find love on The Bachelor I considered applying for Married At First Sight myself as they do background and compatibility checks [and] someone is potentially going on there for love and I wouldn't have to get the whole hey wanna "netflix n chill" conversation. 

'I totally understand that Davina is there for herself, she deserves love, we all do, but there is self-love and there is sheer lack of compassion, self-awareness and being mindful of other people's feelings, and that is where I draw the line,' she added. 

Belinda recently hosted her own dating show on YouTube called Going Live For Love.

On Wednesday, Dr Trisha Stratford has confirmed that she has parted ways from Married At First Sight after seven seasons.

Daily Mail Australia first reported the news on Tuesday and revealed that producers have decided to shake things up by introducing a 'sex therapist' on the expert panel for the next season.

In a statement on the show's Instagram account, the relationship expert announced she was 'taking a step back from the series to focus on her writing, research and neuropsychotherapy'.

A production insider told Daily Mail Australia that the New Zealand-based therapist was notably missing during the second and third stages of castings last week. 

Instead, participants were introduced to an 'American female sex therapist' who asked each of the stars what they were hoping to find in a match.

The new season of Married At First Sight is set to begin filming soon and will air in early 2021.
