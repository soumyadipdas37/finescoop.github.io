The catwalk queen was spotted putting her runway body on full display as she left Blue Bottle Coffee in a black crop top and matching biker shorts.

This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim'.
