Coronation Street star Jack P Shepherd has proudly showcased the impressive results of his hair transplant after his thinning locks put strain on his mental health.

The 32-year-old actor - who has played David Platt on Corrie since 2000 - underwent his first transplant last year, when he admitted that his hair loss had taken a toll on his health to the point that he almost quit the soap.

Jack visited the Crown Clinic in Manchester in January 2019 and in December of the same year to undergo the hair transplant and has now proudly flaunted the incredible results with his moved hairline and thicker volume. 

Wow! Coronation Street star Jack P Shepherd has proudly showcased the impressive results of his hair transplant after his thinning locks put strain on his mental health

After undergoing the work, he has since shown the amazing results of his thickened thatch proving the work was very much a success.  

Last year, Jack made the surprise admission that hair loss made such an impact on his mental health that came close to giving up acting.

He wrote: '9 months it’s been since my hair transplant, I decided to get one as my hair was falling out and it was affecting my mental health to the point where I considered giving up acting and not being in the public eye. Thank you @drasimshahmalak @CrownClinicUK for everything.'

Jack had previously stated he was convinced to have a transplant after his hair loss became more noticeable on-screen.

He said at the time: 'I decided to have it done because my hair loss has really escalated in the last year, particularly at the front of my scalp. I remember seeing myself on screen and thinking: ''Oh my God, it is really falling out''.'

'One of my mates had a transplant and he looked so much better afterwards that I didn't recognise him. I was blown away by the improvement and he told me he wished he had done it earlier.

Jack added: 'I thought if I am going to do it, I should act now so that I can get the benefits for longer.

Removal: Follicles were removed individually from the back of Jack's scalp and then replanted by Dr Shahmalak in the balding areas around his temples and at the very front of his hairline

Hard work: The gruelling procedure is a lengthy but triumphant experience 

Hair loss is common, with approximately 25 per cent of men start to go bald by the time they turn 25, according to The American Hair Loss Association.

An estimated eight million women in the UK are currently suffering from a degree of hair loss, according to a study of 2,000 women by cosmetics giant L’Oreal. 

The most common type of hair loss can be triggered by life changing events such as moving home, a bereavement or pregnancy, leading to overall thinning of the hair.

Yo-yo dieting, the contraceptive pill, stress, eating disorders, drugs chemicals in water and modern pesticides in food have also been associated with hair loss.    

'I want to get my hair back to what it was like before so that I can style it at the front any way that I like. It would great to be in a position to have an Elvis quiff and really have some fun with my hair.'

At the start of Coronation Street's two week Christmas break last year, Jack had the same follicular unit extraction procedure as stars such as Wayne Rooney and Calum Best.

Follicles were removed individually from the back of Jack's scalp and then replanted by Dr Shahmalak in the balding areas around his temples and at the very front of his hairline.

Jack has been dating Hanni Treweek since 2017, following his split from fiancee Lauren Shippey after 15 years together.

Their tumultuous relationship saw Lauren throw the actor out of the house back in 2011 after he cheated on her and fathered another child Greyson - now eight - following a one-night stand.

The actor, who shares son Reuben and daughter Nyla with Lauren, cheated on her with sales executive Sammy Milewski during a one-night stand in 2010. 

It is understood that Jack does not have a parental relationship with Greyson other than to pay maintenance, according to The Sun.

Although Jack has never commented on his son publicly, he is known to support children’s charity Young Epilepsy.

Upon finding out about his infidelity, Lauren kicked him out of the house but he later managed to win her back after proposing to her with a £3,000 engagement ring.

After taking him back the pair went on to split years later.
