Ian Somerhalder appeared at the socially distanced premiere of his upcoming  documentary, Kiss the Ground, on Wednesday.  

As Hollywood events are being totally reworked in the wake of the coronavirus  pandemic, the 41-year-old actor and executive producer attended his first drive-in screening in an olive green t-shirt and dark-wash denim bottoms.

The hunky Vampire Diaries alum appeared in high sprits, as he posed for a number of solo shots, before he was joined by the film's director, Rebecca Harrell Tickell.

While the pair posed for a few shots wearing masks, which had the name of the Woody Harrelson-narrated documentary emblazoned on them, they eventually slid them. 

Despite strict CDC guidelines urging people to keep their mouths and noses covered in public spaces, the duo couldn't help but cheekily kiss the ground. 

Additionally, Somerhalder sported a wide grin, as he expressed his gratitude by placing his two hands together, in a gesture of appreciation.

The new Netflix documentary, which will be released on September 22, takes a closer look at climate control and ways we can change the way we treat our planet. 

Created by filmmakers Josh and Rebecca Tickell, Kiss the Ground aims to show viewers how to stabilize the Earth's climate, restore ecosystems, and replenish food supplies. 

'There's so much bad news about our planet, it's overwhelming. Truth is, I've given up,' the film's narrator, Woody Harrelson, told People last month. 'This is the story of a simple solution, a way to heal our planet. The solution is right under our feet — and it's as old as dirt.'

The outlet revealed the film's trailer detailed how 'destroying soil in agriculture has created an influx of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.'

'To cure our planet we need to cure our soil,' a title card reads, with an expert speaking about biosequestration. 

The star-studded documentary includes appearances from Patricia Arquette, Gisele Bündchen, Jason Mraz, David Arquette and more.
