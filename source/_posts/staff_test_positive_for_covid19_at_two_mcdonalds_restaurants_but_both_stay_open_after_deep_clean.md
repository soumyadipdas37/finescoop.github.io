Staff have tested positive for Covid-19 at two McDonald's restaurants but both have stayed open after a deep clean. 

Two employees who work at separate branches in Birmingham, one at Bordesley Green and another in Yardley, self-isolated after contracting the virus.

One worker tested positive last month and another last week, according to McDonald's.

A source told BirminghamLive: 'I was told that staff members have Covid at these restaurants and have been asked to quarantine.

'One of them - I'm not sure which - had worked two shifts before finding out they were positive. 

'So there may be a risk that the virus has been passed on. I've not been told anything else since so assuming no one has got it.' 

McDonald's said both branches were deep cleaned and all staff members were contacted.
