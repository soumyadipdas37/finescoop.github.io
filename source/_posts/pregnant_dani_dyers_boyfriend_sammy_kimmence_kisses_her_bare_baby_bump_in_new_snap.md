During a Q&A session, one fan told her she needs to bring out a maternity range, to which she responded: 'It's happening trust me. I've literally got 5 outfits, may 3 now the weather has changed. So I cannot wait for you all to see. Not long now.'

When another suggested she also put out a nursing range, the bubbly Essex girl said: 'You know what I'd actually love [to].

'Designing a maternity range is actually a dream because I never see a lot out there. Gonna see how this goes and if all is good defo will consider the nursing clothes.' 

Update: The star has been keeping fans updated on her pregnancy over the past several weeks

Elsewhere, the reality star also spoke candidly about her experiences with pregnancy, as well as her hopes of still being able to hold a baby shower as new COVID-19 pandemic regulations ban groups of more than six gathering.

On her potentially scuppered baby shower plans, the star revealed that she was remaining optimistic, explaining: 'I'm gonna send out save the dates just in case.

'The invites were too pretty so thought I'll send them out and hope for the best... if not there's always more celebrations! Maybe a welcome to the world party?' 

She started off the chat with her fans by admitting that her daily life in recent months has consisted of 'just eating, cleaning, watching Desperate Housewives and having Zoom meetings' amid the pandemic.

Physical changes: 'I'm really noticing the body changes,' she said. 'I've become really veiny! And I've started getting all the aches in my back and my hips'

And while her routine hasn't changed a great deal, she admitted that she's been seeing and feeling all of the differences in her body.

'I'm really noticing the body changes,' she said. 'I've become really veiny! And I've started getting all the aches in my back and my hips.

'I see the midwife Becky today and she has recommended I start some yoga. So definitely going to give that a try.'

She added: Our bodies are actually amazing ain't they. How they can create a little human really is something special.'

When a fan said that her own pregnancy as been 'a roller coaster of emotions', Dani enthusiastically agreed, admitting: 'OMG ain't it. For some reason on Sundays I'm so emotional. I really do cry at anything.'

As for other pregnancy symptoms, she said: 'Still get headaches but not as painful as they [were] before. I'm still so tired though. I do have days where I've got a lot of energy but by the mid afternoon I am so ready to sleep.

'I used to be able to clean the whole house in a day. Now everything is put on pause. But I love eating tomatoes again so I'm so happy about that.'  

Elsewhere, she spoke about how 'worrying' it is to be expecting her first child amid the global novel coronavirus pandemic – while also sparing a though for others.

Baby shower plans: She also spoke about her possibly scuppered baby shower plans, following new restrictions amid the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown

She said: 'You know what it is worrying, especially with the apparent second lockdown! But it upsets me more for people that are struggling more than ever

'It's not spoken about enough on the news on what people are going through and it upsets me to think people are losing [their] jobs, houses and we have no idea when this is all gonna be over! Just think it's been such a tough year for many people..

'I think it's been awful as well for people that haven't been allowed partners in scans etc, I couldn't have not had Sammy by my side which is why I paid for private scans but I know that's not the option for everyone!

'But I get so anxious and nervous I have to make sure he was there.'

In the meantime, the star plans to busy herself working on getting her baby's nursery ready, as she revealed: 'We actually are planning the baby's nursery.

'We have an exciting new chapter coming in out lives as well as the baby coming so makes it all even more exciting for us.' 

Earlier this month, Dani admitted she was becoming increasingly superstitious as her pregnancy progressed, while her boyfriend was desperate to discover the gender of their unborn child. 

She wrote: 'Happy Monday everyone. On way home from seeing our little one The build up to a scan is the most nerve wrecking/exciting thing, I kept seeing one magpie and it was really starting to irritate me I wanted to see 2!

'I’ve become too superstitious can’t believe we are almost half way... Sammy honestly in every scan has become more and more charming to the the lady who scans us so she will tell him what the sex of baby is ITS NOT HAPPENING!!

'Love you little one more and more everyday so glad you are healthy in there.' 

The previous day Dani revealed that she's started feeling her baby kick after worrying she wouldn't be able to due to having an anterior placenta.

The reality star took to Instagram on Sunday to explain that despite her placenta cushioning the baby she's started to feel movement at 19 weeks.

Speaking in her pink dressing gown and black framed glasses, Dani gushed that it was 'so lovely' to feel her child moving around.

She explained how she realised what the kicks were during a visit to a midwife after first assuming the movements 'were wind'.

Dani said: 'The other day i was standing by the sink and I felt this feeling in my belly. I thought "It’s probably wind Dan, stop overthinking".. but maybe it was the baby!

'Anyway, I go and see this lovely lady called Becky in Loughton who I love and adore and she’s a midwife. I go see her once a week in between my scans, she checks my blood pressure and stuff like that and the baby’s heartbeat.

'And yesterday there was a tiny kick and she went "did you feel that Dan?" So I have been feeling the baby! 

'And it's so lovely because at my last scan they told me I had an anterior placenta. 

'It's basically my placenta is at the front and cushions the baby so I might not be able to feel the kicks and movements so much... but I thought so long as the baby’s healthy stop stressing about that.'

Dani also wrote on her post that it would be lovely if her partner Sammy could feel their baby moving while in her tummy. 

Update: Taking to Instagram earlier this month, Dani explained how she first thought the kicks were 'wind' and she had been told at her last scan about the anterior placenta

The beauty ended her update by showing her support for other pregnant women who might have an anterior placenta and sweetly writing 'she was with' them.

In July, the reality star announced she was expecting her first child with boyfriend Sammy - just three months after they rekindled their relationship. 

'Little bubba can't believe you are going to be ours,' she wrote. 'Me and Sammy are so excited to start this next chapter in our lives, feel so lucky and grateful...2021.' 

 Dani also recently said that she has started to 'embrace' the changes in her body.

She wrote: 'I've really started noticing the changes in my body and I'm definitely embracing it.  

'Apparently at this stage I'm supposed to feel 'on top of the world' which I really hope for as the first few months have been really hard.' 

But Dani revealed it was a struggle to find suitable maternity clothes and said she only had a handful of outfits to choose from.   

She said: 'I'm so in denial that I don't fit into any of my clothes anymore. I can't find any nice maternity clothes, all very granny for me.

'I'm literally living in six outfits, I've got two pairs of jeans that I bought from Zara that are like a paper bag and four tight dresses, the ones that are really stretchy.  

'And I'm sitting here like, what am I going to wear today? I have to alternate my outfits cos I've literally got six that fit me.'

Dani has also been giving updates on the severe migraines she's been experiencing during her pregnancy, saying acupuncture had provided her with relief. 

 She said: 'I asked my midwife and it's completely safe, so far so good. I have another one next week. Spent less time on my phone/television (like the doctor said haha). Drinking a lot more water and noticed a difference.'
