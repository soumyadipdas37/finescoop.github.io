Coronavirus denier Pete Evans has seemingly admitted that the 'transformational practises' at his Byron Bay 'healing clinic' are bogus after providing a contradictory 'COVID Safe' disclaimer on the business' website.

The disclaimer is placed under the NSW health department guidelines, and registered businesses are required to 'show commitment to COVID Safety and keeping our community safe.'

The 47-year-old's Facebook page and his Evolve with Pete Evans podcast also feature a similar disclaimer.

The notice claims that conspiracy theorist Pete 'does not endorse' his own 'opinions and conclusions.'

Pete's harmful views have ranged from blaming the virus on 5G cell towers to actively encouraging his followers to go maskless in coronavirus-riddled Melbourne during their second lockdown orders.

Pete's wild views and conspiracy theories on the coronavirus pandemic cost him his lucrative $800,000-a-year job at Channel Seven in May.

Interestingly, the former TV star has still complied with the New South Wales government to register his business as COVID-safe.

Pete and his wife, Kiwi glamour model, Nicola Robinson, 42, are preparing to open their Evolve Health Labs clinic in Australia's hippie capital.

According to the company's Instagram account, the clinic will offer 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work' and 'cryotherapy'.

Meanwhile, the disclaimer on Pete's Facebook reads: 'The information on this page is general information and should not be used to diagnose or treat a health problem or disease.

In a similar message at the end of his recent podcast with  Professor Marc Cohen, it was said:  'Nothing in this podcast should be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any medical condition. 

'Neither Pete Evans nor any sponsor endorse any views, opinions and conclusions expressed or shared in this podcast.'

In June, Pete was invited on 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network.

The program has already faced criticism for choosing to interview Evans, giving airtime to his dangerous anti-vaccination and coronavirus conspiracy theories.
