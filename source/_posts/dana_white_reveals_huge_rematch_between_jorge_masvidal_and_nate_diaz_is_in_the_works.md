A rematch between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz is in the pipeline, revealed UFC president Dana White. 

A medical stoppage due to nasty cuts around Diaz's eye forced a stoppage and led to Masvidal winning the BMF belt in their highly-anticipated first encounter. 

'Gambred' has since gone on to lose in his title shot against Kamaru Usman on short notice, meaning now is an opportune time for himself and Diaz to run it back.

Dana White told ESPN: ''It's being worked on. That fight is in the works.

'[Masvidal] wants to defend [the BMF belt] against Diaz. They were the first two to fight for it, so he wants to put it up versus Nate again.'

It is understood that the rematch is being targeted for UFC 256 on December 12 later this year.  

It was a memorable but frustrating first meeting between Masvidal and Diaz at UFC 244 in Madison Square Garden last November. 

Masvidal was crowned the BMF champion and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson awarded the belt 

Dana White confirmed that the UFC are currently working on setting up the rematch 

Ringside doctors called a stop to the contest given the severity of Diaz's cuts despite the Stockton fighter's protestations. 

Masivdal had been dominating the contest up until that point but many believed Diaz would enjoy his strongest rounds later on when his superb cardio comes to the fore. 

Diaz, 35, has not stepped into the octagon since that defeat having fought twice in 2019, a victory against Anthony Pettis before the Masvidal TKO.
