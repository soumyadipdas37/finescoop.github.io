A seven-year-old girl was viciously attacked by a pitbull terrier running loose on a street in Argentina.

Jazmin, seven, was standing on a street in Buenos Aires with her mother on September 26 when the pitbull sank its teeth into her leg.

Horrifying CCTV footage shows Jazmin's mother desperately trying to free her child from the pitbull's vice-like grip.

The aggressive hound refuses to let go of the young girl, who is dragged across the pavement by the powerful dog, the video shows.

Jazmin, seven, was attacked by an aggressive pitbull while with her mother in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on September 26

The dog latched on to the seven-year-old girl's leg with its teeth and refuses to let go for almost two minutes, horrifying CCTV video footage shows

Crowds quickly rush over to assist the mother, with one man appearing to kick the dog and others desperately try to pull the dog away by its collar. 

But despite the dedicated efforts, the girl's leg remains tightly fixed in the animal's jaw for almost two minutes.   

The pitbull reportedly caused an exposed fracture in one of the girl's legs, but rapid surgical intervention meant she did not lose her leg.

Jazmin's aunt said: 'She is sedated and on medication. The doctors said she has a hip tear and that it is a long process [to heal].

A massive crowd came to the mother's aid as she desperately tried to free her daughter's leg from the pitbull, which was not wearing a muzzle

'My niece was shocked like my sister-in-law, both need a psychologist to attend to them. The baby does not want to eat, she is angry, she cries.'

The relatives have claimed that they had already identified the owner, who allegedly did not admit that the vicious dog belonged to him. 

The aunt added: 'He came yesterday and said that that was not his dog. But later we found out that he had abandoned the dog in the field because the dog had bitten my niece and he also wanted to sell the dog.

'We need him to come and face this and do justice.'
