She will star as Princess Diana in the next series of TV series The Crown and Emma Corrin is embracing the charitable spirit of the late princess – at least in the hair and fashion sense. 

The actress, 24, paired an Oxfam T-shirt with a pair of trendy high-waisted trousers while out at a London farmer’s market.

Emma – who stars in the show with co-star Josh O’Connor as Prince Charles – also clipped her hair off her face, which has been freshly styled for her new role by Sam McKnight – who was the Princess of Wales’s hairdresser for seven years before her death.

Speaking to Vogue magazine, Sam admitted ‘it felt weird’ cutting Emma’s hair to emulate his late client.

‘But then it was one of my first jobs after lockdown so I thought, “You know what? You’re thinking about this too much”,’ he added.

Who needs social media trolls when your own mother sends you nasty comments? 

Chart-topper Lewis Capaldi says: ‘She reads negative comments on Twitter and sends them to me. People saying I look like Meat Loaf. 

'I’m like, “Mum, stop doing it – you built up my self-esteem over years, and now you’re systematically destroying it!"'
