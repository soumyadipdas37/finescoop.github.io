Another blonde intruder is set to be in the running for Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor, and she is going to ruffle some feathers. 

A dramatic trailer for next Wednesday's episode of the reality series shows bombshell Bec Cvilikas' arrival into the mansion. 

In the teaser, host Osher Günsberg tells Locky's top nine that another girl has entered the competition via video link.

Sorry ladies! Locky Gilbert is left speechless as a blonde bombshell intruder makes her entrance on The Bachelor in latest teaser clip for next week's episode

'She's frickin amazing!' an excited Locky gushes in a piece to camera. 

'All the boxes are being ticked.'

And while the Bachelor is excited about the new arrival, fellow suitress Izzy Sharman-Firth describes the newcomer as a 'kick in the d**k'.

Last month, Daily Mail Australia published images of Bec attending a rose ceremony following hometown week, which was filmed in July. 

Five women were pictured on the grounds of the estate: Irena Srbinovska, Kaitlyn Hoppe, Bella Varelis, Izzy Sharman-Firth and Bec, who hasn't debuted on the show yet.

Bella and Irena's place in the top five isn't surprising, as they've both been tipped as favourites for weeks. 

Star on the rise? Last month, Daily Mail Australia published images from July 7, that showed Bec at the last rose ceremony before hometown week

Is that you, Bec? Footage first released more than three weeks ago showed the blonde enjoying a single date with Locky white water rafting 

Bec lives in Sydney, but hails from Queensland's Sunshine Coast. 

She has had a YouTube channel since 2013, and while it is void of content at the moment, it features a recent display photo.

While Bec joins the cast in an upcoming episode, she's already sneakily featured in promotional footage for the series.

The blonde appears to enjoy a single date with Locky whitewater rafting, and even shares a kiss with the former Survivor star while aboard the adventure raft.
