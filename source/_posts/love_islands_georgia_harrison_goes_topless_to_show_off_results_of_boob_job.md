She recently unveiled the results of her breast augmentation, which saw her boost her cup size from 32B to a 32C. 

And Georgia Harrison continued to showcase her enhanced chest as she went topless in a series of sizzling snaps shared to Instagram on Wednesday.

The Love Island star, 25, left little to the imagination as she covered her modesty with her hands while posing up a storm for her social media posts.

Showcasing her toned abs, the model was dressed in just a pair of denim joggers, which she styled with gold jewellery. 

The Essex native, who used a butterfly filter on her face, proved less is more as she opted for minimal make-up and wore her tresses in its naturally curly state.

Explaining why she decided go under the knife, the television personality told Closer Magazine: 'I'd see myself on TV wearing swimwear and think, "Oh, my boobs don't look good", and it made me feel very self-conscious.' 

Georgia went on to say she would limit what she wore, only opting for padded tops or tops with high necklines.

She detailed: 'I'm around 8.5st now, but when I was about 19 I was nearer 12st and my boobs were a lot bigger, I was working abroad and had a really unhealthy lifestyle, and I'd drink and just eat junk.'

'But when my weight dropped a bit, so did my boobs, it looked like there was space to fill. I also had a problem with inverted nipples that I wanted to fix.'

Georgia first found fame with a brief stint on The Only Way Is Essex in 2014, before becoming a household name with an appearance on 2017's Love Island.

The bubbly star then gained an American fanbase when she starred in series 33 of The Challenge in 2018, reaching the final and finishing in eighth place.

The Challenge saw reality stars from around the world come together to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges in the hope of the scooping prize money.

During her time on the show, she was involved in a tumultuous relationship with fellow Brit and Ex On The Beach star Stephen Bear, a storyline that dominated much of the series.

A year later, Georgia's quest for love continued as she signed up to Celebrity Ex On The Beach.

The blonde was previously in a relationship with Sam Gowland, who starred on the same series of Love Island as her and then went on to have an on-off relationship with Chloe Ferry on Geordie Shore.
