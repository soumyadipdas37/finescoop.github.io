Cops seized an array of weapons from Brad Parscale’s home last night, DailyMail.com can reveal.

The demoted Trump aide had ten firearms at his Fort Lauderdale mansion, according to police records released after Sunday afternoon’s standoff.

Uniformed and plain clothed officers entered the waterfront properly around 4:30pm and emerged carrying an assortment of boxes. One had a diagram of a rifle on the side and was marked: ‘This is evidence.’

Parscale’s parents Rita and Dwight spent a few minutes at the house earlier Monday before driving away in his truck. His wife Candice didn’t appear to be home all day and did not respond to requests for comment.

Police raced to Parscale's Fort Lauderdale, Florida home Sunday afternoon after Candice fled screaming into the street in just her bikini - before telling a passerby: 'I think my husband just killed himself.' The Good Samaritan bundled Candice into her car and dialed 911.

Uniformed and plain clothed officers entered the waterfront properly around 4:30pm and emerged carrying an assortment of boxes. One had a diagram of a rifle on the side and was marked: ‘This is evidence'

As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after her 44-year-old husband began 'ranting and raving'.

Candice, 41, then buried her head in the stranger's lap and sobbed uncontrollably until officers revealed he was still alive and asked for his cell number so they could begin negotiations.

Police dispatch records reveal marksmen could see into the $2.4 million property where Parscale sat shirtless on the floor with his dog, drinking beer and 'talking to himself'. 

The witness, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told DailyMail.com she also noticed evidence of bruising on Candice's upper arms.

Further reports made public on Monday confirmed Candice had revealed injuries to officers and told them she suffered them in an 'altercation' with her husband of four years, adding that he hits her.  

The chaotic scene ended without tragedy about an hour and a half later when  police body cam footage showed Parscale being tackled by a SWAT officer after he ignored five demands to 'get on the ground'.

Parscale was then involuntarily committed to a hospital by Fort Lauderdale police.

Brad Parscale's wife begs for help in 911 audio obtained by DailyMail.com, revealing her demoted Trump aide husband is 'pissed with the world'.

A passerby begins Sunday afternoon's call by saying she is in the street with Candice Parscale 'who thinks her husband has shot himself inside their house and she does not want to go back inside.'

As the caller explains what's going on, Candice cuts in to say: 'He cocked a handgun so I came out to the front.'

The caller is heard trying to console Candice, saying, 'it's ok, its ok, take a deep breath.'

Recovering her composure, Parscale's wife tells the operator: 'I was sitting in the back yard enjoying the weather.

'He, he is under a lot of stress right now, and he is pissed at the world and so he like walked out, cocked the handgun, ranting and raving about something, I don't know what.

'So I was like, OK, just chill. Stop. And then I got nervous and I went and I was sitting in the front yard, thinking, something is not right. And I saw him looking out the front window and I heard a loud, a loud noise … I heard a loud boom. Ten minutes ago.'

Asked what kind of weapon he was holding she replies: 'It was some sort of revolver, handgun, like a Glock, I don't know.'

The call then captures a conversation in which the passerby quizzes Candice about her injuries, asking her: 'Oh no, did he do that? Oh my gosh your arms, both your arms. Has he been hurting you?

The response is not audible.

The president announced in July he was replacing Parscale with longtime political aide Bill Stepien. 

Well-placed sources told DailyMail.com Parscale is under investigation for the theft of campaign funds. 

A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home, including two rifles, two shotguns, five handguns and a small revolver. 

The witness, who just happened to be driving by the swank home, said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I noticed this woman coming towards me with virtually nothing on, just her bathing suit.

'She knocked on the window and says, I think my husband just killed himself. I said, ''Oh my God. Oh my God, come get in my car'' and I hung up on my friend and dialed 911.

'She was hysterical, she was hyperventilating, she nearly collapsed but I caught her and pulled her into the vehicle. 

'She had her head in my lap and she was just sobbing. I was just trying to keep her calm.

'When she was in the car and we were on hold, I saw both her arms had bruises. She is just a tiny thing. She seemed so sweet and distraught.'

As the two women huddled in the vehicle, cops surrounded the property, stationing marksmen with shields in front of the driveway while approaching from the rear on boats.

A video obtained by DailyMail.com reveals Candice, by now wrapped in a white towel, peering over a line of police cars as officers call up her husband's cell and negotiate his surrender.

'The police presence was huge, they were being extra protective in case he started shooting. Once he answered the phone they knew he was alive,' the Good Samaritan said. 

'I didn't see him come out of the house because they made everyone stand so far back. But it was over quickly, maybe an hour and a half to two hours. The police were very calm, very professional.

'The wife was sat on a gurney for a while and she seemed to calm down. 

'There had clearly been some stress for a while and she just seemed relieved it was over. Her husband has got a lot going on, he's a mess.'

A Trump insider told DailyMail.com that Parscale went into a tailspin after he was demoted in July and replaced by his former number two, Bill Stepien.

It was widely reported that the President lost faith in Parscale after a much-trumpeted campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma drew a dismal crowd, relegating him to his previous role in digital and data strategy.  

The well-placed source said that just days later Trump ordered an audit of the spending of the Republican National Committee.

The probe appeared to be geared towards examining Parscale's handling of the campaign's money, the source said, putting the 6ft 8in aide under 'tremendous pressure'.

DailyMail.com published exclusive images of Parscale, his wife and several friends drinking beer and liquor by their pool days after his demotion.

Our source said such scenes were becoming routine for Parscale who was spotted stumbling out of bars in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his wife own three swish condos worth a combined $5 million.

Parscale's parents Dwight and Rita Parscale attempt to make an emergency visit with their son on Monday afternoon 

The couple have at least $300,000 worth of cars - including a 2017 Ferrari, a Range Rover and a BMW X6 - while public records suggest Parscale has owned as many as eight boats.

Their spending spree represents a remarkable turnaround for the college basketball standout who lost his family's company to bankruptcy in the mid-2000s but rebuilt his finances after working for Trump in various digital guises since 2011.

'The thing about what Parscale did with the finances of the campaign could actually be totally legal,' the source added.

'But Brad has tons of bills since his lifestyle picked up, and he sees the gravy train coming to an end.'

Police dispatch notes from Sunday's incident reveal police were alerted at 3:56pm when Candice told the passerby there had been a 'suicide attempt' inside their home.

'Male was ranting and raving about something. Heard gun cock and then a gunshot,' the notes read. 'Male was looking out the front window, walked away from the window and heard a loud boom.'

The witness added: 'The wife was sat on a gurney for a while and she seemed to calm down. There had clearly been some stress for a while and she just seemed relieved it was over. Her husband has got a lot going on, he's a mess'

'The police presence was huge, they were being extra protective in case he started shooting. Once he answered the phone they knew he was alive,' the Good Samaritan said

The witness, who just happened to be passing by the swank home, said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I noticed this woman coming towards me with virtually nothing on, just her bathing suit'

The report says the male was wearing just a white robe and carrying a revolver.

It says neither the caller, nor the wife could confirm whether or not Parscale had shot himself because Candice was 'too scared to go inside'.

'There are multiple firearms in residence. Husband is barricading himself inside,' the dispatch adds. 'Keeps hanging up on unites.'

Officers were able to 'get a visual' of Parscale, shirtless, wearing a black hat and 'sitting on the floor talking to himself'

They could not see what he had in his hands but were able to report that he was sat with his dog, arguing with someone over the phone and was periodically peering through the blinds.

The dispatch reports that Parscale walked out of his house to talk directly to negotiators before wandering back inside for a beer.

When he came back outside and sat on his stoop 'talking to himself' an order was issued to 'move in to grab him now'.

Moments after the order was issued Parscale ignored five demands to 'get on the ground' - but was dramatically tackled by a SWAT officer.

'Due to the subject disobeying my lawful commands coupled with the subject being substantially larger than I am, Subject approx 6`6' and wearing shorts with pockets that could easily conceal a firearm, I initiated a double leg takedown,' wrote Sgt. M. Moceri.

Further Reports made public Monday confirmed that Candice had revealed injuries to officers and told them she suffered them in an 'altercation' with her husband of four years.

'While speaking with Candace Parscale (sic) I noticed several large sized contusions on both of her arms, her cheek and forehead,' wrote Officer S. Smith.

'When I asked how she received the bruising, Candace Parscale stated Brad Parscale hits her. When asked if he made these markings today, she claimed he did not.

'I continued to ask if Brad Parscale physically assaulted her in any way today and she said no, but he did forcibly smack her phone out of her hand when she was attempting to call Brad Parscale`s father.'

Another officer, T. Skaggs, wrote in his report Sunday: 'I made contact with Candace (sic), who stated that Bradley has been stressed out for the past two weeks and has made suicidal comments throughout the week to shoot himself.

'Bradley did not make any suicidal comments today however Candace was concerned for his safety. Candace advised Bradley drinks and he 'suffers from PTSD'.

'While speaking with Candace I observed several bruises on both which she advised occurred a few days ago, during a physical altercation with Bradley, which she did not report.'

Candice told Officer Skaggs that Sunday's incident was sparked by a 'verbal altercation' after which Bradley loaded a firearm in front of her.

'Candace immediately fled residence and stated she heard a loud bang shortly after. Candace stated that they realized that Bradley did not shoot himself when they heard Bradley ranting and pacing around the residence and the dog barking franticly.

'However, they were concerned that Bradley might still try to shoot himself, due to him being in possession of several firearms and refusing to vacate the residence.'

The officer said he made contact with Parscale on a landline but he refused to come out.

A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home (pictured), including two rifles, two shotguns, five hand guns and a small revolver 

Records previously obtained by DailyMail.com reveal that the day after his birthday, Parscale bought himself a BMW X6 (right) crossover worth $78,300. Then in April, a pre-owned $146,000-Range Rover Autobiography (left) appeared in the driveway 

The turning point came when a friend who happened to also be on the police department came to the house and helped to talk him down.

'Bradley`s speech was slurred as though he was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and he seemed to be crying,' Skaggs went on.

'I continued to make landline with Bradley, who advised several times that he would not exit the residence without speaking to his wife Candace.

'With the assistance of Ofc. C. Wilson, Bradley was convinced to exit the residence and was placed into custody by FLPD SWAT personnel.'

Cops seized the ten firearms and also took photos of injuries on Parscale's body that had happened several days earlier, according to the report.

The Trump aide said he was not on medication and wasn't suffering from any medical illnesses but cops decided to detain him under Florida's Baker Act.

He can be held involuntarily for up to 72 hours while he is medically assessed.

There was no sign today of Candice at the couple's house, which is being guarded by three security officers.
