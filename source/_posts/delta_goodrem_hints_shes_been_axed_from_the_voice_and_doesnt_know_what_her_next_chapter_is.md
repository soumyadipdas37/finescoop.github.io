Her future on The Voice Australia's coaching panel has been in question since Seven acquired the franchise from Nine last month.  

But Delta Goodrem, 35, failed to deny rumours she's been axed when questioned on whether she will return in 2021 by The Kyle And Jackie O Show on Thursday.

Delta, who joined The Voice nine years ago, told the radio duo she's unsure about whether she will return to the show, explaining: 'I genuinely don't know what the next chapter is.' 

'I genuinely don't know what the next chapter is': Delta Goodrem, 35, hinted she won't return to The Voice during an interview with The Kyle And Jackie O Show on Thursday  

Hinting that the decision is still up in the air, Delta continued: 'Every season, at the end of [The Voice], I take stock of the year. I go, 'How do I feel as an artist about this next chapter? What do I want for my next chapter?' 

'And I'm truly taking it step by step [this year],' she added. 

However, later in the interview, Delta suggested that she may indeed have departed the franchise by insisting that she's currently enjoying focussing on her own creative pursuits.

'I'm really loving making my own music,' the Born To Try hitmaker explained, reminding fans that she plans to release an album by the end of the year.  

'There's so many layers to every decision I ever make, I've been in the industry my whole life,' Delta continued, adding that she feels 'really proud' of everything she's done with The Voice.

It comes amid rumours Delta, who is The Voice's longest-serving judge, has been boned by Seven due to a 'salary conflict.'

Making changes: Last month, The Daily Telegraph also reported that Channel Seven is 'set to axe coaches Boy George and Kelly Rowland' as part of a cost-cutting measure. Pictured left is Boy George, and right is Kelly Rowland

Delta, who is rumoured to earn between $1million to $2million a year, is out of the network's price range, according to the The Daily Telegraph last week. 

Last month, the publication also reported that Channel Seven is 'set to axe coaches Boy George and Kelly Rowland' as part of a cost-cutting measure.  

'One of the big changes Seven plans to make is how much is being spent on judges,' a source close to The Voice reportedly said.

It is claimed Seven is 'in talks' with American R&B star Usher, while other replacements include Kylie Minogue and homegrown talent, Jessica Mauboy. 

Big Brother host Sonia Kruger, 55, who previously presented the singing competition and is now over at Seven, is set to host the series in 2021.
