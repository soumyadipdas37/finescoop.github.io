James Rodriguez has arrived in the city of Liverpool ahead of the imminent completion of his move to Everton.

The Real Madrid playmaker is set to join the Toffees on a three-year deal, reuniting him with Carlo Ancelotti, who he worked under both at the Bernabeu and at Bayern Munich, with the fee reported to be around the £20m mark. 

The 29-year-old Colombian touched down in England last week and spent time at swanky Mayfair restaurant Babbo, which is owned by Arsenal stars David Luiz and Willian, late on Wednesday night.

The move from Real Madrid will see the Colombian reunite with manager Carlo Ancelotti 

 Rodriguez was spotted last week in London after flying in to seal his move to the Toffees 

Rodriguez will join up with the Everton squad upon completing his medical this week, and will be Ancelotti's second signing in a matter of days.

The Toffees completed the signing of Napoli midfielder Allan for a £21million fee over the weekend.

Meanwhile Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in 2014 from Monaco, has struggled to convince at the Bernabeu, having been sent out on loan for two seasons to Bayern Munich in 2017. 

Despite being handed chances to impress by Zinedine Zidane, it is now clear his future remains away from the LaLiga champions, and Goodison Park is set to be his next destination. 

Everton expect to confirm the capture of the Real Madrid midfielder in the coming days

Rodriguez has played under Ancelotti at both Bayern and Madrid, with a strong working relationship previously appearing to hold a great deal of weight for the Colombian. 

Similarly, Allan praised Ancelotti as he put pen to paper at his new club on Saturday. 

He told the official Everton website: 'It is a real pleasure to sign for Everton. I am immensely happy to be here.

'I hope, like I have done in my entire career, I contribute with my performances together with my team-mates and that I put in some great games, great performances and win important things.

'It is a club with a rich history in the Premier League, has real ambition and then there is Professor Ancelotti. He has done everything possible to bring me here.

'It is the size of the club and the name of the coach which means you don't think twice about coming to Everton.'
