Iain Stirling has revealed that he has dropped nearly two stone during lockdown after cutting down on craft lager.

The Love Island narrator, 32, shared that he has gone from 15st 9lbs to 14st after the closure of pubs during the pandemic forced him to overhaul his 'dangerously unhealthy' lifestyle.

Talking to Vicky Pattison on her The Secret To podcast, Iain revealed: 'I have lost one stone and 9lbs. I was 15st 9lbs last time I weighed myself, which was a while ago when I was on tour. Now I am 14 stone dead.'

Amazing: Iain Stirling has revealed that he has dropped nearly two stone during lockdown after cutting down on craft lager (pictured earlier this month) 

He added: 'It's because I've not got access to draft lager. I can't go to a pub. I've built one in my garden now but I didn't have any pubs I could go to.'

Iain, who recently appeared on Soccer Aid 2020, added that lockdown has made him revaluate his diet and admitted that his lifestyle was 'dangerously unhealthy' beforehand.

While he also revealed that fiancée Laura Whitmore's health levels have 'gone down' during lockdown while his have gone up. 

He said: 'I have not done anything healthy. It just shows you how dangerously unhealthy my lifestyle was before I went into lockdown.

'Laura's general health levels have gone down and mine have gone up. She was quite healthy before lockdown and I was really bad.

'Especially with gigging you go to places where there is just beer available. I would always have a couple and you are on the road so it's take away food and service stations.  

'So being at home I have cooked more. For soccer aid I started to do a bit of training but not anything mad.' 

The chat comes after Iain and Laura revealed that they've built a pub in the back of their garden.

Love Island host Laura, 35, took to Instagram earlier this month to share a snapshot of herself enjoying drinks with Iain, 32, and a small group of friends.

Iain took the snap, which showed their pals giving the thumbs up as they sat by the bar, which included a Guinness tap, glasses and bottle of liquor.

Captioning the image, Laura partially quoted classic sitcom Cheers, as she wrote: 'Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name and they're always glad you came... The Snug EST 2020.'
