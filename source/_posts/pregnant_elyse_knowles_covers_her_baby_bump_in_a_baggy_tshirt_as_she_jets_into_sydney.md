Elyse Knowles and her boyfriend Josh Barker jetted into Sydney on Saturday, four days after announcing they're expecting their first child together.

The couple were spotted arriving at Sydney Airport after enjoying a holiday in the Northern Territory.

Elyse, 27, covered her baby bump underneath a baggy beige T-shirt and loose matching coloured pants.

Josh and Elyse have been vacationing in the Northern Territory and during their trip, the pair announced they're expecting their first child together.

The model shared the joyful news to her Instagram page on Wednesday night. 

'And then there were 3 #babybarker,' she wrote alongside a gallery of images of the couple on holiday.

The announcement comes four months after Elyse and Josh bought a $2.3million beach house in Byron Bay.

Their new 1960s built property is located in the old part of Byron Bay town, just a short walk from the main beach and surrounded by tranquil greenery.

Last year, Elyse told Daily Mail Australia that the couple had moved to Byron Bay from Melbourne while chasing a more sustainable lifestyle for themselves.

Speaking at an event in September, the model explained she'd physically confront strangers that she would see littering in Victoria, before eventually leaving.

She explained: 'I just can't see it being left on the ground and when they're dropping rubbish, I think they need to be told off.'
