Alessandra Ambrosio showed off her assets in a barely-there nude bikini as she enjoyed a beach outing this weekend.

The 39-year-old supermodel put her chiseled midriff on display in the skimpy swimsuit while frolicking across the sand.

She demonstrated her enthusiasm for athletics with a spirited game of volleyball and could also be seen prancing about in the water.

Sometimes she wore her luxurious dark hair down and accessorized the look with a pair of gleaming aviator sunglasses.

The Brazilian bombshell also warded off the California rays in a wide-brimmed straw hat with a couple of massive tassels.

While prancing about in the waves however she evidently decided it would be more convenient to sweep her hair up into a bun.

'Ale,' as she is affectionately known to her fans, added a splash of dazzle to the look with necklaces including a medallion.

It appeared she had brought a couple of different pairs of shades to the beach as she also modeled a blue-green pair of goggles during her volleyball game.

Alessandra fired up her Instagram page that day and treated her more than 10 million followers to a few summery snaps.

She lounged in a cabana with a netted wooded canopy that complemented her flowing white lace trousers.

Emphasizing her cleavage in a frilly floral bikini top, she wore a flower in her hair and accentuated her screen siren features with makeup.
