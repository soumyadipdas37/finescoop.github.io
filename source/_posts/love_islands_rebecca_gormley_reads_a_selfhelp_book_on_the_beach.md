Flashing a hint of her toned abs, the beauty pageant queen's two-piece featured a low-cut bralet and matching running tights.

The influencer ditched her signature heels in favour of going barefoot, and carried her belongings in a black designer handbag.

Her glossy tresses were worn in two braids placed on her crown, while she highlighted her features in minimal make-up.

The media personality looked focused as she caught up on some reading during a rare appearance without her partner.

The brunette recently landed herself in hot water after she and boyfriend Biggs, 27, ignored quarantine rules. 

They jetted straight from a holiday in Spain to Scotland last month and brazenly posted about it on Instagram.

The couple had been holidaying in Ibiza, and should have quarantined for 14 days when they returned to the UK after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Earlier this year, their relationship seemed to be on the rocks last month when Biggs was accused of messaging another woman just days after he and Rebecca reunited following 10 weeks apart in lockdown.

The Glaswegian car repair specialist is said to have exchanged a series of messages with healthcare assistant Caitlin Fulton, who claims she learned of his blossoming romance with Rebecca when she saw pictures of them kissing.

'We'd been messaging back and forth after he followed me on Instagram and we'd talked about going away when lockdown ended, to a holiday cottage or a lodge somewhere in the UK,' she told The Sun. 

'He even left me a voice note saying that coming down to see me "sounded good". We were making plans as recently as Saturday.' 

Caitlin told the publication that she learned of Biggs' relationship with Rebecca when she saw photographs of them kissing in Newcastle.

'I was a bit shocked that he had a girlfriend,' she said. 'And obviously I would be shocked if that was my boyfriend messaging someone.'

The couple split up briefly before lockdown after she had a drunken sleepover with Love Island 2019 contestant Michael Griffiths.
