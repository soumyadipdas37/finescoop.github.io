She is expecting her firstborn child.

And Emma Roberts sat down in front of her mirror to snap a selfie in which she modeled a pink silk polka-dot dress on Saturday.

The 29-year-old niece of Julia Roberts teamed her 1950s chic ensemble with a pair of gleaming black leather Mary Janes.

Emma, who is expecting by her beau Garrett Hedlund, captioned: 'baby doll dress has a whole new meaning.'

That day she swung by her Insta Stories to post another couple of mirror selfies standing up in the same ensemble.

Emma revealed on one of the pictures that she was in a $450 spring prairie dress by Batsheva and her platform pumps were by Miu Miu.

She also tagged coiffeuse Kylee Heath and makeup artist Kara Yoshimoto Bua and the stylist sister-act of Brit and Kara Elkin.

The Scream Queens star officially confirmed in late August that she and Garrett were awaiting the arrival of their firstborn baby boy.

Emma posted a sweet Instagram album of herself sitting by the window with her 'two favorite guys,' Garrett and their incoming baby son.

Celebrities flocked to her comments to congratulate her, including her Scream Queens co-star Lea Michele and her Aunt Julia who wrote: 'Love you.'

The pregnancy was first confirmed in July by Emma's mother Kelly, who replied: 'Yes' on Instagram when someone asked if the Nancy Drew actress was expecting.

That month an Us Weekly source dished: 'They know the sex of the baby but are keeping it private for now. They haven’t picked out any names yet.'
