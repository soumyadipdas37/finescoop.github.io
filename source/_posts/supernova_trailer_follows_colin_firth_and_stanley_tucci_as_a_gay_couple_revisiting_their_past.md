Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci play a gay couple trying to visit places from their past... as one deals with early-onset dementia in the first trailer for Supernova.

Firth, 69, and Tucci, 59, play Sam and Tusker, respectively, who have been together for over 20 years, with Tusker diagnosed with early-onset dementia two years ago.

They travel across England in an old RV, visiting friends, family and places from their past as their relationship is put to the ultimate test in the trailer, via Variety.

First trailer: Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci play a gay couple trying to visit places from their past... as one deals with early-onset dementia in the first trailer for Supernova

Dementia: Firth, 69, and Tucci, 59, play Sam and Tusker, respectively, who have been together for over 20 years, with Tusker diagnosed with early-onset dementia two years ago

The trailer opens with Sam and Tusker in bed, with Tusker pointing above them stating, 'You have to find the three brightest lights there, that make the triangle.'

We see that they're looking at a celestial chart above them, as Tusker explains, 'And that's where the Milky Way is.'

Tusker is then seen driving the couple's old RV, telling his partner Sam, 'It feels good to get back on the road again, don't you think?

'But how about just exploring the outer regions of fifth gear?' Tusker asks, which causes Sam to laugh alongside him.

They arrive at their destination and greeted by some friendly faces, but Sam has a surprise party planned for Tusker, with Sam adding, 'I thought we'd have a party.'

Later they're in a very small bed, with Tusker claiming he's 'on the edge' but Sam falls off the bed, causing Tusker to laugh through his hands.

Tusker asks Sam if he had 'one wish in the world, what would it be?' and Sam says, 'I wish this holiday wouldn't end.'

Tusker asks Sam, 'So, can you tell, that it's gotten worse?' referring to his dementia, though Sam doesn't answer. 

During a family dinner, Tusker stands up and says he wants to make a speech, but after looking it over, he decides to let Sam do it for him.

Sam reads that Tusker is, 'slowly losing my ability to remember' adding he 'definitely wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this man next to me.'

Tusker tells Sam, while leaning on his shoulder, that he wants to be remembered, 'for who I am, not who I'm about to become.'

Tusker tells Sam that it isn't 'fair to you' to have to go through all of this with him, but Sam insists, 'it's not about fair, it's about love. I want to see this through, with you, to the end.'

The trailer winds down with a series of shots showing Sam tending to Tusker as his dementia gets worse. 

Tusker is heard in voice over saying, 'A wise man once said we will not starve for lack of wonders, but from lack of wonder' as the trailer comes to an end.

The film will have its world premiere at the San Sebastián International Film Festival on September 24, with the U.K. premiere will take place at the BFI London Film Festival on October 11.
