Sevilla and Bayern Munich fans have ignored warnings they would be entering a 'biological bomb' in order to attend the UEFA Super Cup final in Budapest.

Despite the match taking place in a coronavirus hotspot, 20,000 supporters gathered in the Puskas Arena to cheer their teams on but there are fears the game will become a 'super spreader'.

Images show little social distancing with fans crowded together, although there are more supporters from Spain present than their Bundesliga opponents.

Sevilla outnumber their German opponents after the Bundesliga side returned two thirds of their ticket allocation beforehand

German authorities warned Bayern fans about the dangers of travelling with the game taking place in a coronavirus hotspot

Sevilla fans were filmed partying on a plane on the way to the match while Bayern returned two thirds of their tickets after German authorities warned they would be entering a 'biological bomb', meaning there were more places available for local supporters.

Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Soder said: 'My stomach hurts thinking about the Super Cup.

'Budapest is a risk area. There is a high incidence of infections and we have to be very, very careful that we do not risk a football Ischgl.'

Bayern have offered fans travelling to Budapest free coronavirus tests until Saturday afternoon, two days after the game

Ischgl is a ski resort village in Austria where at least 6,000 people are believed to have contracted coronavirus. It has been dubbed 'Ibiza on ice' and has been used as a byword for anywhere that Covid-19 infections spiral out of control.  

Authorities in Hungary also raised concerns at the game taking place with the presence of fans. 

Gergely Karácsony, mayor of the host city, previously stressed that he would prefer the game to be played behind closed doors, and would have sought to do so had he been afforded the legal authority.

Bayern have offered fans travelling to Budapest free coronavirus tests until Saturday afternoon, two days after the completion of the game between the German and Spanish clubs, according to RTL.

The club have set up a testing area at the Allianz Arena, where returnees are able to get a free test and will receive their results by email. The 14-day quarantine period can be bypassed in the case of a negative test result.  

Leon Goretzka equalised for Bayern after Lucas Ocampos gave Sevilla an early lead as fans were able to celebrate both goals 

Video footage showing Sevilla fans partying on their way to Budapest emerged ahead of the game on Thursday afternoon

It follows from a recent surge in cases in Bavaria, which led to the abandonment of plans for fans to return to the Allianz Arena to watch Bayern demolish Schalke 8-0 in their Bundesliga season opener. 

Supporters have seen two goals in the game so far with Lucas Ocampos giving Sevilla an early lead from the penalty spot after David Alaba brought down Lukk de Jong. 

But Bayern equalised through Leon Goretzka after a cut-back from Robert Lewandowski.
