A bride has hit out at her future mother-in-law in a furious online rant after her fiance's mom secretly tried on her wedding dress and left it 'broken' and 'stretched out'. 

The unnamed 26-year-old bride, who is from the US, took to Reddit to vent her frustration with her mother-in-law-to-be, while admitting that she is now considering postponing her wedding after her partner's parent refused to replace her broken wedding dress. 

In the post, which was shared on the site's 'Am I the A**hole' forum, the bride detailed how her fiance took her dress from their apartment at his mother's request, and then allowed her to try it on behind the bride's back - before returning it with a broken zipper and 'stretched out' fabric.

The bride began her rant by explaining that her mom-in-law had been 'annoying her' about her choice of dress, recalling how she demanded to have input into the final design. 

'My future mother in law kept annoying me and sending me suggestions for choosing the right wedding dress, and said that she knew better and tried to get me to approve of wedding dresses that she chose and when she couldn't enforce her decision she demanded that I take her with me to buy my wedding dress so she could have an opinion,' the bride wrote. 

However, when the bride grudgingly invited her mother-in-law along on her wedding dress shopping trip, she said she was too busy to make it - so the soon-to-be newlywed went with her own mom instead. 

'I was able to find a really nice dress although it cost me a little over what I saved up for, but it was worth it,' the bride said. 'I made some changes to it and it was perfect, it arrived to my apartment at the end of the week, I made sure it was stored in a safe place so it doesn't get ruined.'

Having taken care to put her wedding dress away in a safe storage area, the bride was horrified when she returned to her apartment this week and found that the gown was missing - along with her fiance.  

'I called him immediately knowing that he must've taken it to show it to his mom since she continuously asked to see it and refused to have me send her pictures of it on Facebook,' she said. 

'I was so mad when it was confirmed that my fiance took it to show it to his mom,' the bride continued. 'He said he was gonna be home in 30 minutes after he went to the supermarket.'

When her fiance finally returned, after making his bride 'wait for longer' than he had promised, she found her dress 'buried underneath' the grocery bags, and soon discovered, to her horror, that the 'zipper was broken' and 'the dress itself was stretched out'. 

'I was like what the f**k happened to it, my mother in law must've tried it on, because it looked ruined, the straps were almost loose,' she recalled. 

The bride's fiance soon confessed that both his mother and his sister had taken turns trying on the gown - so she phoned her mom-in-law to demand an apology, and a new dress. 

'I was absolutely livid, she told me she did nothing wrong and that I was making a big deal out of it,' the bride revealed. 

'She said she'd get a replacement for the broken zipper, but I told her to pay for a new dress since it was stretched out and no longer fitting. She refused and said that I probably wasn't happy with my dress choice and wanted to her to pay so I could get a new one.' 

The furious bride-to-be added that her own mother has offered to pay for repairs to the dress, but she feels that the design is somehow tainted because someone else has worn it before her. 

'I yelled at [my mother-in-law] for trying it on and ruining it, [and said] that she and my fiance were responsible for ruining my dress so they should pay for a new one,' she said. 

'It's done, no longer fitting, the straps are in a horrible condition, my mom said she'd pay for fixing it but I just hate it now that someone else wore it before me.

'I'm mad at both of them and seriously considering postponing the wedding.'

The bride asked her fellow Reddit users for their thoughts on her fiance and her mother-in-law's behavior - with many people agreeing with her that she needs to think twice before going ahead with the wedding, while some even urged her to call it quits with her partner altogether. 

'Girl do you hear yourself?? Your fiance took your wedding dress without permission and allowed multiple people to try it on!' one user commented. 

'Do you understand how disrespectful and inappropriate that is? You not only have a bad mother in law problem, you have a HUGE fiance problem. Needless to say, id be doing more than postponing.'

Another chimed in: 'Seriously, who just tries on another woman’s unworn brand new wedding dress? And not only did the fiance not stand up for her, he was complicit. Serious, I would totally reconsider marrying into this family.'
