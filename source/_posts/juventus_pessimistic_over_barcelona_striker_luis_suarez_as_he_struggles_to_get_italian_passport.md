Juventus are 'growing pessimistic over completing a deal for Luis Suarez' due to issues with the Uruguayan securing Italian citizenship. 

The Turin club are at their maximum allotment of foreign players in the squad, which means Suarez has to obtain an Italian passport. 

The process is a slow one and Juventus are increasingly concerned that the red tape will take up too much time.

According to Goal, they are pessimistic about the deal being concluded, despite the fact that personal terms on a £9million-a-year deal have been concluded. 

Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman has no place for Suarez in his side but a fee has not yet been agreed between both clubs.  

Juventus begin the defence of their crown on Sunday against Sampdoria and Pirlo is understood to be considering alternatives to Suarez. 

Gonzalo Higuain's contract was terminated so the club are eager to arrange their striking options as quickly as possible. 

Andrea Pirlo is increasingly pessimistic about the chances of the Uruguayan joining 

Suarez wants to leave Barcelona and Ronald Koeman has told him he is not in his plans 

The situation with Suarez's passport application is a hindrance in this regard and Edin Dzeko might well join in the coming days. 

His move from Roma is dependent on the capital club signing Napoli frontman Arkadiusz Milik. 

Pirlo reiterated the urgency of signing a new forward over the weekend, saying: 'I need a striker as soon as possible. But the market is long. There will be time to be able to work until October 4.'

Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud has also been linked but dismissed that speculation last week. 

Suarez remains of huge interest to Juventus but it seems bureaucracy may yet scupper his favoured move and prevent him teaming up with Cristiano Ronaldo in an all-star attack next season.
