Kyle McFadzean scored a late winner to give Coventry their first victory since their promotion back to the Championship.

Coventry took the lead just after half-time as goals by Matt Godden and Callum O'Hare cancelled out Lyndon Dykes' opener from the penalty spot.

Yoann Barbet thought he salvaged a point in the 75th minute for Queens Park Rangers, but McFadzean's late winner meant the Sky Blues took all three points.
