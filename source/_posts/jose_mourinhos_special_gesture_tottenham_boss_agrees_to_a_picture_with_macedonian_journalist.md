Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho made a Macedonian journalist's day after agreeing to take a picture with him at his side's Europa League qualifier with Shkendija on Thursday.

Igor Aleksandrovic, a freelance reporter, was on the Zoom press conference previewing Spurs' trip but failed to ask a question in time and was upset at missing out on the chance to speak to Mourinho, who his late father had idolised.

Word made its way back to Tottenham's press team and Mourinho was brought back into the room for a chat with Aleksandrovic, who asked two questions about the game and then a very personal favour.

He said: 'Hello boss, this is the unique opportunity for me to ask you two questions and one favour. I have to ask you something on behalf of my father.

'First greetings to you from him, but he is now in heaven. One of the occasions when he was very sick he told me if I ever have the opportunity to see you, to ask for a picture with you because he always raised me like you when you are the head coach of any team, psychologically winning or losing - he has massive respect for you.

'If you allow me a picture of you I will frame it and put it in his eternal resting place. If the match goes good for you and your team will you allow me to do that?'

Mourinho was humbled by the journalist's story and promised a picture would be possible.

The Portuguese said, before answering the two football-related questions: 'Thank you so much. The picture has nothing to do with the result.

'The picture is done, let's do it. If you can meet us before the game, or maybe in the hotel is easier. If it's after the game, it's after the game. It's nothing to do with results.

'My pleasure to do the picture with you. And my honour to your father and respect that he feels so strong about me. I don't deserve that.'
