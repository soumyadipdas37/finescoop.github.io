Liverpool have reportedly informed Barcelona that they want £15million for midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum.

Recently-appointed Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman, who managed Wijnaldum when in charge of the Dutch national team, is eager to work with the 29-year-old again.

Barcelona had been hoping to sign Wijnaldum for £10million, but that doesn't match Liverpool's asking price, as reported by The Mirror.

Wijnaldum is into the final year of his contract at Anfield and is open to a move to Barcelona.

Barcelona have already brought in Miralem Pjanic but are seeking further reinforcements in midfield. 

Liverpool are interested in signing Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara, but are reluctant to pay the Bundesliga side's asking price of £30million.

Wijnaldum joined Liverpool from Newcastle in 2016 and has made 187 appearances for the Reds. 

Last season Wijnaldum played a key part as Liverpool ended their lengthy wait to win the league title.

However, he has yet to be offered a new deal and there is a possibility that he could depart before the closure of the transfer window.
