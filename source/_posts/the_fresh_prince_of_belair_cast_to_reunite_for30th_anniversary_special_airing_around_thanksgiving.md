The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air cast - Karyn Parsons, Tatyana Ali, Will Smith, Daphne Maxwell Reid, Alfonso Ribeiro, Joseph Marcell, and DJ Jazzy Jeff - will reunite for a 30th anniversary special set to air around Thanksgiving on HBO Max.

Marcus Raboy will direct the unscripted special about the fish-out-of-water NBC sitcom, which aired for six seasons spanning 1990-1996, is scheduled to tape on September 10 - according to Variety.

Sadly, James Avery - who played patriarch Philip Banks - passed away at age 68 in 2013 from complications following open heart surgery.

As for the original Vivian Banks, King Ester star Janet Hubert, she was mysteriously fired off the popular show after the first three seasons due to an alleged 'feud with network officials.'

At the time, Smith blamed the 64-year-old Daytime Emmy nominee's ego during a radio interview in which he claimed Janet called him the 'anti-Christ' and wanted it to be called 'The Aunt Viv of Bel-Air Show.'

'It's the 30th anniversary a Fresh Prince. And they want to start a war,' Hubert wrote on her public Instagram account on August 18.

'Well here is my challenge - we can either keep this war going for another 30 years but I'm not going to, or you can sit down with me and talk to me and not about me Mr. Smith then let's do it. Can you only sit and talk about your strange unsavory problems in front of the world?'

'Accept my challenge or shut up!' On August 18, the 64-year-old Daytime Emmy nominee challenged the 51-year-old Oscar nominee to 'sit down with me and talk to me'

The Julliard grad continued: 'Accept my challenge or shut up! Either you're telling the truth and the BLACK MEN of the cast are telling the truth or I'm telling the truth. And only YOU and I... and quite a few others, know the truth let's do this do YOU have the courage? #seeyouinseptember'

It's only been four months since the 51-year-old Oscar nominee last assembled Reid, Parsons, Marcell, Jeff, Ali, and Ribeiro for a reunion during the finale of his Snapchat series, Will From Home.

Before that, the same group gathered at Nobu Malibu in 2017 in honor of a British family, who bid the highest for lunch with the cast through Parson's charity, Sweet Blackberry Foundation.

And earlier this month, THR reported that Smith was shopping around a drama reboot of Fresh Prince based on Morgan Cooper's viral mock trailer, Bel-Air.
