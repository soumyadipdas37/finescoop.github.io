Yet Bella Thorne kept her woes in the past as she stepped out in an abs-flashing ensemble to celebrate her pal Pia Mia's birthday.

Bella looked sensational for the meal as she emerged with her pal, who was flouting coronavirus rules by going mask-free for the outing. 

The duo were sure to put on a stunning display as they both donned all-black.  

Her black trousers featured zips along the fronts of the leg which acted to lengthen her already impressive pins to perfection. 

Bella's red hair was worn in loose waves, while the birthday girl wore her extension-enhanced bleached tresses in tumbling lengths.

Both Bella and Pia have signed up to OnlyFans to capitalise off their sexy looks and become high profile members of the site. 

Bella caused controversy when she netted $1million in one day on the site, which led to ructions with sex workers who claimed she swindled users.  

OnlyFans is an online service that allows for public figures to charge fans a subscription to their site, where they often share content usually deemed too provocative for other social media platforms.

Much like others who run their own pages on the subscription service, Pia charges fans for access to her content in tiers – $14.99 for 30 days, $33.73 for 3 months and $62.96 for 6 months.   

Pia has also given her followers another opportunity to dent their bank accounts, as she's added an Amazon wishlist link to her profile – asking for everything from suitcases to lamps to LED strip lights.   

Since launching in September 2016, OnlyFans has reportedly paid out more than $1 billion to creators, according to the company. The service currently boasts over 50 million registered users and 700,000 content creators.
