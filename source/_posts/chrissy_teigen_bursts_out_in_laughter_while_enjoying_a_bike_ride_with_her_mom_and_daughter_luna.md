She is expecting her third child with husband John Legend. 

But Chrissy Teigen enjoyed a girls day on Thursday heading out for a bike ride in Los Angeles with her mom and daughter Luna, four. 

The 34-year-old model was spotted bursting into laughter as she enjoyed the fresh air.

The soon-to-be mother-of-three opted for a casual look in black biker shorts and an ultra cropped matching top. 

She teamed an unbuttoned white dress shirt over top and ankle wrapping leopard sandals. 

Chrissy tied her brunette locks up in a sleek and large high bun, while covering her eyes in large dark sunglasses.

The group rested for a minute on the sidewalk, staying on their bikes and Chrissy was seen bursting into laughter. 

Her mom Vilailuck 'Pepper' Teigen rode alongside her, while Luna pushed along in a small pink tricycle. 

The Sports Illustrated star and the musician recently announced they are expanding their family in his new music video Wild last month.

In the video, belter John tenderly holds the beauty as she rests her hands upon her baby bump. 

Chrissy went on to confirm the pregnancy herself in selfie videos showing off her already visible bump. 

She later revealed that the baby, who comes after she and John welcomed Luna and Miles through IVF, was conceived naturally and a surprise for the couple.

'It was a surprise. A little quarantine surprise, I guess you could say,' John shared with Craig Melvin while on the Today show. 'But we're very excited, and we’re grateful for all the well-wishes we've gotten from people all around the world. Thank you so much.' 

Chrissy and John married in 2013, after six years of dating, and welcomed Luna in 2016 followed by Miles in 2018, both through IVF. 

Last year, Chrissy said she wanted to wait a little longer before expanding their family.  

After a fan asked her on Instagram last year when she was going to have another child, Chrissy replied, 'Gonna try to wait a few years before trying again. These guys are exhausting!'
