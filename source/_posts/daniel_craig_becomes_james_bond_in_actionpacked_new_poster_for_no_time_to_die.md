A new poster has been revealed for No Time To Die, Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond, on Wednesday.

Shared by the franchise's Instagram account, it saw 007 go on a mission as he held an assault rifle and looked through the cross-hairs at potential enemies.

In the action-packed poster, the actor, 52, transformed into the iconic spy by wearing a tense expression as he set off on his task.

Exciting: Daniel Craig looked suave as he transformed into James Bond and went after enemies in an action-packed new poster for No Time To Die, which was released on Wednesday

Daniel looked suave in a dark blue jumper that he teamed with a white shirt and a pair of black trousers. 

Teasing what's to come for Bond, the caption said: 'The mission that changes everything. The new poster for @007 is here. In cinemas this November.'

The 25th film in the franchise finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. 

Leaving his seemingly happy live with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), Bond returns to the field to face Safin who is armed with a new dangerous technology that could impact the world.

A new action-packed trailer for the film was released earlier this month, and saw the spy risk is life when back in the field. 

In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.

The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change.

In the summer, it was reported that the film's release date was set to change once again, after the COVID-19 crisis led the launch to be delayed by seven months.  

According to a report from The Sun, it was being considered whether the film's release should be moved yet again over fears of losing money at the box office.

It was claimed that the continued increase in COVID-19 cases in the US meant film executives were concerned about how many people would be able to see it.

A source told the publication: 'There are secret talks about what to do. Having No Time To Die earning less than half a billion would be deemed a disaster no matter the circumstances.'

MailOnline contacted EON productions for comment at the time. 

The upcoming movie will mark Daniel's last-ever outing as the iconic character, which the actor recently insisted he was 'fine' about.

Soon: In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and November 20 in the US 

Look away now! The film sees Bond come to grips with villain Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek, 39, who viewers were told is concocting a plan that could kill 'millions' 

He told British GQ: 'I'm really... I'm OK. I don't think I would have been if I'd done the last film and that had been it. But this, I'm like... Let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm fine.'

The actor also insisted he isn't too worried about his post-Bond career, as he claimed: 'I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.'

No Time To Die is co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge who was brought on board to sprinkle magic on the script for the 25th movie in the franchise based on Ian Fleming's hit novels.

Trying to save him: In the trailer, 007 is told of the danger Safin presents by Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), who tells him that he is after 'revenge'

Meeting his match: '00' agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch) was also clearly a force to be reckoned with as Bond refers to her as a 'disarming young woman' after she attempts to shoot him
