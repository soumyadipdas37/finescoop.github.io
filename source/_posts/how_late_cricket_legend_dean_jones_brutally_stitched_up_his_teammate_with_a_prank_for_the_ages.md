Former Australian cricketer Damien Fleming has revealed the extreme lengths late legend Dean Jones would take to stitch up his teammates.

The cricketing world remains in shock and mourning after Jones died from a massive heart attack in his hotel lobby in Mumbai last week aged 59.

The dominant batsman's cheeky sense of humour has since been remembered by several Australian cricket personalities.

Former fast bowler Fleming recalled the way Jones would treat rookies coming into representative teams with an array of unique requests to keep them on their toes.

'He was just a 12th man’s nightmare,' the 50-year-old said on The Grade Cricketer podcast.

It's the 12th man's job to run equipment or refreshments on to the field at the request of players in the starting 11.  

'If he was not out you’d have to be watching every ball because he might want chewy, he had different gloves for different bowlers … then when he introduced the sunglasses he had orange ones for glarey conditions, he had black ones for light conditions,' Fleming continued. 

'If you didn’t get out there quickly, he’d have you throwing balls to him for a couple of hours after the day’s play. You had to be right out there.'

Fleming was subject to the usual ribbing of a young player by his experienced teammates as he moved through the ranks.

He'd had his bowling shoes taped to the dressing room ceiling and batting pads thrown in the spa, but didn't mind, as he was happy listening to heavy metal on his walkman watching the day's play.

But one day when his walkman stopped working with Jones at the crease, Fleming became worried. 

'I used to listen to my heavy metal, I’d watch every ball just knowing I’d need to be out there, especially if it was Deano,' he said.

'I press play on my cassette walkman, it doesn’t work. Press play again and it’s not working. I don’t care if you sticky tape my boots to the roof and put my pads in the spa, you don’t mess with my cassette walkman.

'I’m going to give the boys a spray and then I hear this, "Deano’s waiting, he wants something". And it’s like a heart attack thinking, "Oh jeez, what does he want?"

'So I grab some gloves, grab a bat, running out there - and you know how big the MCG is, normally the batsman would meet you halfway to help you out. But not this day. He’s making me run all the way to the pitch.

'I’m thinking, "S**t, I’m going to be throwing balls for bloody four hours here".

'I ran as fast as I can, get a couple of metres away, look up and he goes, "Hey champ", as he called everyone, "look up".

'And he threw the two batteries from the walkman to me.

'He did have a good sense of humour, Deano.'

Tributes have flowed for Jones since his death - including an outpouring of support for his wife Jane, two daughters Augusta and Phoebe and his 11-year-old son.

Jane Jones - who was married to the man affectionately known as 'Deano' for 34 years - said she was overwhelmed by the scale of response in the wake of his shock death of a heart attack in the lobby of an Indian hotel on Thursday.

'My girls and I are devastated and saddened beyond belief to hear of Dean's death in India,' Mrs Jones told The Age.

'My beautiful husband, the love of my life has lived his life with every bit of energy at his disposal, and he leaves an enormous gap in our lives which can never be filled.'

'He leaves us with so many wonderful memories that will last forever. At this challenging time, when our grief is so raw, we have drawn much consolation from the many messages of goodwill and support from so many people around the world.

'Given Dean's special love for the sub-continent, it was especially touching to hear so broadly from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. We are overwhelmed by the scale of the response to the news of his death and we will forever be grateful for that.'

Jones' daughter Phoebe said her family is 'broken' in an Instagram post mourning the loss of her father.

The tribute post was accompanied by a happy snap from her childhood.

'Our family is eternally grateful to Brett Lee for doing everything he could,' she said.

Phoebe thanked cricket fans across the world who put their bats out in honour of 'Deano'.

'We are overwhelmed with your outpouring of kind words, support and tributes,' she said.

'His legacy will live on in every life he touched.

'I just keep staring at my phone waiting for him to call and tell me this is just a bad dream.'

His other daughter, Augusta shared a series of pictures with her dad as a tribute.

'I cannot believe I am writing this. My heart is broken, My Dad. My Hero. The sweetest and most caring person you could ever meet,' she wrote.

'If only you could see now how many lives you touched. If only you could see now how loved you were.

'You held my hand through the toughest times this year, how will I do this without you?

'The heavens have opened their gates for another angel. Wait for me dad. Everything I do is for you. I love you Dad.'

Koby Dean Hamilton, 11, is Jones' son to Kerri-Anne Hamilton- the cricket legend's well documented former mistress.

A 'heartbroken' Ms Hamilton has posted moving tributes on social media and shared photos of Koby with his father.

She was back on Instagram on Monday morning to thank well-wishers for the many messages and gifts she and Koby have been inundated with as they mourn their tragic loss.

The show of support comes after Ms Hamilton was cruelly targeted by online trolls on her Twitter account on Thursday night, where she was called an 'irresponsible woman' and a 'DNA thief'.

'Overwhelmed, thanks to all who have reached out. Your messages of support, flowers, cupcakes, chocolates, wine, spinach & ginger Panadol, PS4 vouchers and beer drop offs have not gone unnoticed,' Ms Hamilton captioned a photo of some of the many floral tributes received.

'I am very lucky to have wonderful people around me. Koby and I feel loved and supported.'

Kerri-Anne Hamilton has also shared photos of her and Jones together in happier times

A day earlier, Ms Hamilton shared a heartwarming throwback photo of Koby spending some quality time with his father.

'If you know my son you've probably heard him say, 'do you know my dad is Dean Jones?' Proud is an understatement! He adores him and will no doubt live his life with a bat and ball his hand,' Ms Hamilton wrote on Sunday.

She also shared a heartbreaking photo of Koby kissing a golf ball with Deano 324 written on it.

'When I open my eyes will I see you again? #ripdad,' the photo was captioned.

Ms Hamilton also shared photos of the pair during their affair which lasted more than a decade.

'After 22 years the sparklers have gone out. Every time I saw him I had fire in my belly! His love for me, my love for him will never die. I adore you! I am heartbroken,' she wrote.

Ms Hamilton said Koby knew Jones 'loved him'.'
