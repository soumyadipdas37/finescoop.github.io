Olivia Culpo was summery chic when she was glimpsed out and about in Los Angeles this weekend.

The 28-year-old sensation was joined by her younger sister Sophia as she emerged from lockdown to go purse shopping.

Wearing her dark hair down in an attractive bob, Olivia slipped into a flowing white sleeveless blouse that perfectly suited the season.

The sizzling sensation, who was crowned Miss Universe in 2012, tucked the top into a fashionably torn pair of high-waisted jeans.

She cinched a belt around her trousers to emphasize her enviably trim waistline as she surfaced for her masked outing.

Meanwhile Sophia, who herself has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, flashed her toned legs in a pair of bike shorts. 

Sophia complemented the shorts with a stylish sweater and balanced on a pair of stilettos while ambling about with her sister.

As Olivia headed to her car that day she could be seen cradling her beloved puppy Oliver Sprinkles whom she adopted this July. 

Their latest sighting comes after Olivia announced on her Insta Stories last month that she suffers from endometriosis.

Recently she revealed in a People interview that she is 'trying to do the holistic route as of now' rather than a laparoscopy.

'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we'll see. It's a journey. Every month is different because I try different things every month. But I'll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone's different,' she said.

Olivia explained that her diagnosis 'was something that I was nervous to share because I really didn't know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are.'

She shared: 'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods. They're not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility.'

Olivia is currently dating NFL dreamboat Christian McCaffrey who recently flashed the flesh in a sizzling photo-shoot for GQ.
