Controversial former My Kitchen Rules judge Pete Evans is preparing to sit down for a tell-all interview.

The 47-year-old will discuss 'his beliefs, the controversy and his career' on The Ben, Rob and Robbo Show on Monday at 1pm.

The interview with the anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist will stream live on Facebook, Youtube and Twitter.

Evans has been involved in a string of controversies since being sacked by Seven earlier this year.

In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale'.

Among his false claims about the pandemic, he has previously declared he's immune to coronavirus and blamed the health crisis on 5G technology.

He recently endorsed conspiracy theorist David Icke, a Holocaust denier who was denied entry to Australia last year after protests from the Jewish community. 

It is not suggested that Evans endorses the views of Icke relating specifically to Holocaust denial or the Jewish people. He instead supports Icke's views on globalist conspiracy theories and media manipulation.

In recent years, Evans also has claimed the Paleo diet can prevent autism, that camel milk can supplement breastfeeding and osteoporosis suffers shouldn't eat dairy.

Divisive: Evans has been involved in a string of controversies since being sacked by Seven earlier this year for his extreme views. In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale' 

October 2014: Evans claims the Paleo diet can prevent autism

March 2015: His book is pulled from shelves due to its bone broth recipe for infants

July 2016: Evans claims vegan women should eat meat during pregnancy, advises against wearing 'normal' sunscreen, and claims Wi-Fi is 'dangerous'

August 2016: He says osteoporosis suffers shouldn't eat dairy

September 2016: Evans claims camel milk could supplement breastfeeding

April 2017: Evans campaigns against the 'mass fluoridation of public water'

December 2018: Evans reveals he looks directly into the sun

April 2020: Evans' ketogenic recipe book is slammed by health professionals and he is fined for promoting his 'healing lamp'

Evans' central belief is 'food is medicine' and that by following a Paleo diet, people can develop superhuman immune systems that can withstand all illnesses, including COVID-19.

There is absolutely no scientific basis for this. Following a particular diet does not make a person any less likely to contract the deadly respiratory virus.

Pete is now also planning to open his Evolve Health Labs clinic in Byron Bay.
