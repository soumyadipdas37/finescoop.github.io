The New York police department’s chief chaplain was mugged during his daily walk on the Upper West Side Tuesday morning.

Rabbi Alvin Kass, 84, said he was walking at Riverside Drive and West 107th Street around 5.45am when an individual approached him and said 'I’m hungry, I need food.'

The suspect began rifling through the rabbi’s pockets and grabbed some cash, but when they found Kass’ police shield, they dropped it and fled on foot, cops say.

The rabbi was not injured in the incident and no arrests have been made. Kass is the NYPD’s longest-serving officer, working for more than 54 years.

Kass was also attacked in the same neighborhood back in 2016 while exercising. He suffered minor lacerations to the face when he was pushed to the ground by an assailant.

New York City has seen a startling uptick in crime this year, which police say is due in part to the pandemic, staggering unemployment, and protests decrying police brutality and racism.

The crime wave has forced police departments to increase weekend patrols citywide.

The incident comes a day after New York Judge Phyllis Chu, 56, was punched in the face by a stranger on a Citi Bike as she headed to a downtown courthouse from the Staten Island ferry around 9.30am on Monday.

She said the attack was random and she suffered a swollen lip in the incident and was treated at a hospital.

Hours after Chu’s incident, in the Bronx two men, aged 26 and 28, were shot by an unidentified suspect. The younger man was shot in the chest; the older victim in the leg and arm.
