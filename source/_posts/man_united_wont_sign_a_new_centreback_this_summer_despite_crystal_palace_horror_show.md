Manchester United 'have no plans to sign a centre-back during the current transfer window' despite their defensive horror show against Crystal Palace.

Their first-choice central defensive pairing of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof looked vulnerable to Palace's pace during Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford.

With other options in that department including Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Axel Tuanzebe and Teden Mengi, United did not feel it necessary to prioritise another centre-back this summer.

Victor Lindelof struggled against Palace's pace on Saturday but there are reportedly no plans to sign anyone else in central defence before the window closes on October 5

And, according to The Athletic, those plans haven't changed despite Palace exposing a significant weakness in that area.

That's despite United reportedly being offered players who could potentially reinforce their defence.

Instead, United have concentrated on recruiting another midfielder, with Donny van de Beek arriving from Ajax for £35million, and a right-sided attacker.

However, negotiations over Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho have stalled with the clubs still in disagreement over the England star's £108m valuation.

Saturday's abysmal performance has heaped pressure on executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to invest heavily again to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team competitive despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

But it appears any further spending before the window closes on October 5 will be in other areas of the pitch and not the centre of defence.

However, it's possible a new left-back may arrive with United holding talks for Porto's Alex Telles, who would offer competition to Luke Shaw.
