She was trolled and labelled the 'villain' in last year's season of The Bachelor.

And now Abbie Chatfield has leaped to the defense of Bella Varelis when she was called the same during Thursday's episode of the show, after the brunette beauty turned on her best friend in the mansion, Irena Srbinovksa.

The former contestant, who vied for the heart of Matt Agnew last year, called the term 'dehumanising'.

'I don't like where this is going!' She was trolled and labelled the 'villain' in last year's season of The Bachelor . And now Abbie Chatfield has leaped to the defense of Bella Varelis when she was called the same during Thursday's episode of the show

'Like image on a TV show you're just being yourself, and then having an edited version of you out there and then getting called a villain,' she said.

'How dehumanising. How f***ing dehumanising. That's the main issue.'

Abbie said that trolling on social media 'spins a narrative', which easily influences others. 

It creates a character out of someone and I don't like it. I don't like where this is going,' she added.

Abbie instead suggested: 'We could just have normal humans in a normal situation, reacting in normal ways, perhaps there are certain things that are amplified.

'The good parts and the bad parts to create this juxtaposition of the good and the bad person, maybe?''

'You don't know her (Bella), she doesn't know about you or care about you, so stop commenting on her on a TV show. Newsflash - no one cares about you if you're a troll,' she ranted. 

Last year, Abbie said she was blindsided by her 'villain edit'  and that her loud, playful and sexually forward personality was misinterpreted by her fellow contestants.

'I never did anything mean to any of the women, beyond spilling the beans on the "dog c***t" saga. I never spoke of any other woman to Matt [Agnew], I never said anything insulting to any of the women and I certainly didn't make any of them feel the way that I felt. Yet somehow, I was the villain,' she wrote in an article for Whimn.
