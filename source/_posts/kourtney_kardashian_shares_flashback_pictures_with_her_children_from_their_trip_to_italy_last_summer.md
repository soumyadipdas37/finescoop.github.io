As summer in quarantine draws to a close, this reality star is feeling nostalgic for simpler times.

On Tuesday, the first day of September, Kourtney Kardashian shared a throwback gallery of images from her family trip to Italy last summer, showing her children Mason, Reign and Penelope enjoying various activities.

The Poosh founder, 41, also posted several stills of an idyllic beach town, which she geolocated as being in San Fruttuoso, Liguria, Italy.

'Until we meet again,' Kourtney captioned the sumptuous flashback pictures. 

In the cover image, the KUWTK star's youngest son Reign, now five, ran towards her in the crystalline waters with arms outstretched, with beachgoers, sunbathers and gorgeous Italian architecture serving as the backdrop.

Another snap saw Mason, ten, and Penelope, eight, seated at a table feasting on clams and pasta, respectively.

Kourt also made sure to take a snap of one of her own dishes, which looked to be a sinfully delicious plate of cheesy green pasta.

Other pictures showed the setting as a whole, which looked to be a teeny beach town rich with local flavor and culture.

The eldest Kardashian sister and her children were in that part of Italy in July 2019, and also spent time on a yacht.

They were reportedly also in in Corsica during the getaway, as well as Porto Cervo and Costa Smeralda off the coast of Sardinia. 

Kourtney's younger half sister Kendall Jenner was also spotted with the group at one point during the vacation. 

And although travel that far afield has proven more complicated for most this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, it isn't like Kourtney is sitting at home depressed.

The ex of Scott Disick was in fact seen just one day prior to posting the Italy pictures living it up with new bestie Addison Rae in Miley Cyrus's disco ball-filled Midnight Sky truck, which is currently doing the rounds in Los Angeles.
