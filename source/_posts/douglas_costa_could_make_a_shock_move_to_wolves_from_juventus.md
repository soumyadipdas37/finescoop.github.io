Douglas Costa could be making a surprise transfer to Wolverhampton Wanderers, according to Tuttosport. 

Agent Jorge Mendes, who also looks after Cristiano Ronaldo, is looking for a new club for Costa, who may not have much of a future at Juventus. 

He is currently looking to push forward a deal with Wolves, who just sold striker Diogo Jota to Liverpool.

The Brazilian striker's future at Juventus is uncertain under new manager Andrea Pirlo

This leaves a spot open for Costa, but Juventus will likely also be looking for another replacement before allowing him to leave. 

His future under new boss Andrea Pirlo is uncertain, having only played an eight minute cameo in their 3-0 win over Sampdoria in Juventus' first game of the Serie A season.

Since arriving at Juventus in 2018, Costa has made 102 appearances, scoring 10 goals and providing 21 assists.

Costa joining Wolves could provide Nuno Espirito Santo with a potent attacking force. Combined with Adama Traore, the pair would create some frightening pace down the flanks.  

Fiorentina's Federico Chiesa and Shanghai Shenhua's Stephan El Shaarawy are said to be potential candidates to replace Costa in Turin, with new the club looking to bring in more Italian talent. Alvaro Morata has passed his medical for a return to the Old Lady.

Manchester United are also thought to be in the hunt for Costa, having put in an initial bid of £27million last month.
