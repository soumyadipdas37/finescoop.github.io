Watford are in talks over a move for former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Sam Hutchinson.

The versatile 31-year-old is a free agent after his contract ran out at Hillsborough at the end of last season.

Hutchinson, who started his career at Chelsea, was hugely popular with supporters at Wednesday where he enjoyed a six year spell. 

Sam Hutchinson is currently a free agent after leaving Sheffield Wednesday this summer

He was a key figure in Wednesday reaching back-to-back play-offs under Carlos Carvalhal.

The midfielder also made 133 league appearances but was not offered a new deal as manager Garry Monk looked to bring down the age of his squad.

Hutchinson started out at centre back and also figured at right back before re-inventing himself as a defensive midfielder.

Watford have been talking to Swansea City about a move for their captain Matt Grimes and saw defensive target Alfie Mawson of Fulham join Bristol City on loan this week.
