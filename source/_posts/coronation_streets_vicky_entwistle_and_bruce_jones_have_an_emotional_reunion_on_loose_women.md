Vicky Entwistle and Bruce Jones had a tearful reunion on Loose Women as they saw each other for the first time in several years.

The actors, who played Janice and Les Battersby on Coronation Street, were close friends during their time on the soap and both were thrilled to see each other again.

Becoming emotional, Vicki said: '[It's been] years [since we've seen each other] – four years, maybe five. You look gorgeous still!'

Bruce replied: 'So do you, you look absolutely beautiful, you've never changed. I'm nearly in tears looking at you, the memories are flooding back.'

Vicky tearfully replied: 'I promised to myself I wouldn't cry – sorry!'

Bruce admitted: 'I owe Vicky so much. Thank you very much Vicky. I'm back, I'm top form!'

Explaining their on-screen bond, Bruce said: 'The first day we met, we gelled. It was such a great thing for me to have an actress of Vicky's standard. We just gelled and became The Battersbys.

'The pair of us were scared at first. When we read the first scripts, I thought we’re never going to get away with this, we’re going to be hated. 

'But we did it. We worked hard and we did it. Vicky got me through quite a lot of it. I just wanted to be an actor.

'The first two years we were hated...I think I even got told off by my mum. She told me if I did anything against Mr Ken Barlow, that nice man, don’t come home!'

Explaining why she had become emotional, Vicky said: 'I think just seeing his little face. We did have some great laughs.

'We used to get told off like you wouldn’t believe. They’d say "cut" and we’d be laughing our heads off over what we had to say or do – it was really outrageous. We were like, "We’re going to ruin this programme!" 

'We’d both separately been watching it for years. Then all of a sudden, he’s got to headbutt Curly and I’ve got to shout at everyone. We’re like, "No one’s going to like us!"  And to be honest, I don’t think they did!'

Asked if they’d consider a return, Vicky said: 'If they gave us the Rovers, Bruce, what do you think? Would you be up for running that with me?'

Bruce replied: 'So do you, you look absolutely beautiful, you've never changed. I'm nearly in tears looking at you, the memories are flooding back' (pictured in 2001) 

Bruce added: 'I would. But I’d only go back with you'.

Vicky replied: 'Yeah, I don’t want you to go back with anyone else!'

Bruce and Vicky joined Coronation Street in 1997, with Bruce leaving 10 years later and Vicky departing the soap in 2011.
