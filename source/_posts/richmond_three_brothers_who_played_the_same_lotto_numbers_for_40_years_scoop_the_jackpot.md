A trio of brothers who have been playing the same lottery numbers together for 40 years have won $511,000. 

The trio were one of ten division one prize winners in Saturday's TattsLotto draw. 

One of the brothers - from Richmond, Victoria - revealed the group played the same numbers every week.

'I don't remember why we chose these numbers exactly. All I know was 40 years ago we each wrote down numbers and selected a ticket to play. We've been playing ever since,' he said.

The man revealed he spent ten minutes double checking he hadn't made a mistake when he saw the win.           

'I checked the ticket a number of times before checking the website a number of times,' he said.

'I just wanted to make sure it was confirmed and re-confirmed before I told them.

'Once I realised it was true, I had the honour and pleasure of telling my brothers we were division one winners.'

He said it was a great feeling to call his two other brothers and let them know about the winnings.

Paul Vo and Loan Nguyen own the Winning Post in Richmond where the ticket was purchased.

It was the third division one entry they sold at their business in 2020, with others winning in May and Sseptember. 

The winning numbers were 28, 7, 36, 1, 42, and 22.

The supplementary numbers were 14 and 11.
