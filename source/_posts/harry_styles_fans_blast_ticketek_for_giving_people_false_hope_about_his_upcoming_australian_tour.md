Harry Styles is one of the only major touring artists not to have rescheduled their 2020 Australian tour dates amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But despite promoters hoping the tour gets the go ahead, it seems very unlikely with international and domestic travel restrictions still in place.

With Melbourne currently under one of the world's toughest coronavirus lockdowns, and the star required to self-isolate for 14 days upon his arrival, fans have blasted Ticketek for giving them false hope.

Anger: Harry Styles (pictured) fans have blasted local ticket seller Ticketek for giving fans false hope about his upcoming Australian tour

'The Harry Styles Australia & New Zealand tour is proceeding as planned and we are excited to welcome everyone to the events in November and December,' a representative for Ticketek wrote on Saturday.

'Can't wait to go and watch a cardboard cutout of Harry on stage for 90 minutes,' one fan sarcastically wrote on Twitter.

'What world do y'all live in where there isn't a global pandemic and no international flights until at least 2021,' a second added.









Not likely? With Melbourne currently under one of the world's toughest coronavirus lockdowns, and the star required to self-isolate for 14 days upon his arrival, fans have blasted Ticketek for suggesting the show will go ahead 

Meanwhile, a third chimed: 'As much as I want this to be true, I just don't see it happening and it breaks my heart.'

Others appeared to be angry that the ticket distributor suggested that there was a possibility the tour could be cancelled instead of rescheduled. 

'WTF 'cancellation' why not postpone? I can't go through the stress of getting tickets again,' one person wrote. 

Can he come? But despite promoters hoping the tour gets the go ahead, it seems very unlikely with international and domestic travel restrictions still in place

Harry is booked to play shows in Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth across November and December.

A statement posted to Ticketek's website reads: 'The Harry Styles Australia & New Zealand tour is proceeding as planned and we are excited to welcome everyone to the events in November and December. 

'The safety of fans, artists and staff is always our top priority and we will continue to monitor advice from the local state Government regarding mass gatherings. 

Uncertainty: Harry is booked to play shows in Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth across November and December 

'In the event of a cancellation, exchanges and refunds will be processed according to AU/NZ consumer law.' 

Harry is no stranger to Australian shores, having had played more than 30 stadium shows with his former band One Direction.

Former bandmate Louis Tomlinson was forced to postpone his first Australian tour in the wake of the pandemic which was due to take place in July.

Love on Tour begins in Mexico on September 29, before heading to Brazil, and Colombia before playing shows in Australia and New Zealand in November. 

Busy boy: Harry is no stranger to Australian shores, having had played more than 30 stadium shows with his former band One Direction.
