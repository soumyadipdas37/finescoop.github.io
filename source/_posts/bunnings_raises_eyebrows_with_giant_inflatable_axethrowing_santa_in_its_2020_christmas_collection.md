When you think of Santa Claus, you are likely to picture a jolly man with rosy cheeks quietly lifting presents from an enormous sack and leaving them under a tree.

So perhaps it's no wonder that Bunnings has raised eyebrows with a peculiar addition to its 2020 Christmas collection: an inflatable axe-throwing Saint Nick hurling weapons at a reindeer pinned to a rotating dart board.

The Australian hardware giant left many scratching their heads with the launch of the $129 outdoor decoration, which stands 1.8 metres tall and looks more appropriate for Halloween than the festive season.

At a store in Innaloo, nine kilometres from Perth CBD, a mother was overheard saying: 'I'm horrified, but want one.'

Bunnings has raised eyebrows with perhaps this peculiar addition to its 2020 Christmas collection: an inflatable axe-throwing Santa hurling weapons at a reindeer pinned to a bullseye

The unique piece - sold exclusively in Bunnings stores and not on the brand's website - is designed for the garden and comes with 18 LED lights which illuminate at night. 

But if an axe-wielding Father Christmas isn't quite to your taste, the retailer has plenty of other inflatable Santas engaging in a variety of activities which range from the traditional to the downright zany.

Options include Santa playing a saxophone, driving a forklift full of gifts, riding a shark and standing alone, watching the world go by.

They're all part of Bunnings 2020 festive range which was released in August to brighten the mood amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

The inflatable Santa is part of Bunnings special 2020 Christmas collection (pictured) which launched in late August to brighten the mood amid COVID-19

The collection – which is only available in select stores – includes pink reindeer, LED and fibre optic trees and giant Nutcracker soldiers that tower over a metre high.

A Bunnings employee from the Craigieburn outlet, 25 kilometres from Melbourne CBD, announced the launch with a Facebook photo that quickly went viral after it was posted on August 26.

'After the year we've had, bushfires and a pandemic (and our metro Melbourne folk still getting through), looking forward to seeing lots of seasonal lighting,' she wrote in the caption.

It's not clear which other stores are stocking the special collection, which does not appear online because it all items are promotional.
