Hundreds of students at Exeter University flocked to outdoor parties over the weekend prompting renewed fears that lives are being 'endangered'.

On Saturday night, September 19, pictures were captured of hundreds of students groups gathered outside Lafrowda Flats, a large block of accommodation on campus, from around 11pm until 2am.

On the same night, an officially socially distanced outdoor cinema event was held on campus, which again saw massive groups of students congregating close together, despite the government's new rule of six. 

Other reports have been shared of hundreds of students all tightly packed together on the streets of campus.

Exeter University has confirmed that socially distancing was maintained when the outdoor cinema event - a screening of Korean film Parasite - was held last night, Sunday, but has decided to cancel the same event this evening. 

An Exeter University student has defended the behaviour of students, but has voiced concerns over how large gatherings of students are being tackled on campus.

The student, who witnessed massive groups gathering outside Lafrowda Flats, on Saturday, said: 'Initially there were only two campus patrol people there and they were just walking on the outside of the huddle of people.

'About an hour later a campus patrol van came but again, it didn't seem as though there was any effort to break up the group. More and more people started arriving even though the campus patrol were there.

'I can understand why students are meeting outside in such big groups. I think we are all desperate to meet new people, make friends and have a freshers week which is at least similar to previous years and how we expected it to be pre-Covid.

'The opportunities that we have to meet people outside are limited to the people in our flats and for many people who are in flats of very few people who maybe share different interests, it can be an isolating experience.

'The campus patrol do not seem to have the authority to break up groups which encourages people to join as we realise that there is a likelihood that we will not be asked to stick to the rule of six.

'On the other hand, it is frustrating as all of our lectures are online and many of the clubs and societies cannot go ahead and yet people are mixing in huge numbers and nothing is being done about it.

'The university put up a marquee on campus a few days ago and they are playing music and films which gives students more opportunity to meet people in a safe environment with track and trace which will hopefully reduce the amount of people who are encouraged to break the rule of six.

'I think it is very easy to demonise students for breaking the rules without recognising that for most first years it is their first time away from home and it can be difficult if you don't know many people and are stuck in your room doing the occasional virtual yoga session or pub quiz online.'

The new academic year at Exeter University has begun today with lessons being held face-to-face and online.

A University of Exeter spokesperson said: 'Unfortunately, some of our students did not socially distance as required at an outdoor cinema event on Saturday night and, although the Sunday outdoor cinema night event worked well after we made some changes, we have decided to cancel this evening's film showing.

'We apologise to any students who were following the Covid-19 rules and anyone who was concerned by the lack of social distancing. We are trying to find the right balance between supporting student activities and the government guidance on Covid-19 but we will always prioritise the safety of our community.'
