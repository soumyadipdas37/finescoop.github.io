They recently revealed the band was reuniting and releasing a comeback album.

And Faye Tozer looked sensational as she headed to The One Show in London on Friday night to perform Steps' comeback single What The Future Holds.

The singer, 44, was joined by bandmate Lisa Scott-Lee ahead of the show with both women putting on a stylish display in purple mini dresses as they left their hotel.

Faye flaunted her toned figure in a satin mini dress which boasted a pretty floral pattern all over it.

Her frock also featured stylish puffed-sleeves and a high-neck line, with the star completing her ensemble with some white trainers.  

The blonde beauty tied her hair back into a sleek ponytail ahead of the show but was later seen with her locks flowing over her shoulders.

While Lisa, 44, also cut a fashionable figure as she left the hotel, wearing a chic purple dress with long sleeves and a ruched detail at the waist.

She added some extra height to her frame with a pair of black stiletto heels with a peep-toe detail.

The brunette styled her hair in curls and let them cascade over her shoulders as she strutted to the taxi waiting to whisk her off to the TV studios.

Although not seen leaving the hotel, the pair's bandmates Claire Richards, Ian 'H' Watkins and Lee Latchford-Evan joined them at The One Show.

After debuting the new song, Lisa took to Instagram to share her excitement about the band being back together and making music again.

Steps delighted fans last Monday when they announced they were reunited for a new album and nationwide tour in 2021.   

The group first announced the venture with a series of cryptic posts spelling out their iconic name, before confirming rumours they're set to join forces once again for a new album.

Wow! Lisa also looked sensational in her stage outfit, which included a corset style top and a pair of statement sparkly shoes

They also eased that their latest tour would be their 'biggest spectacle yet' as they join forces with stars including Sia to pen singles for the album.

The band first teased their new music by each tweeting an illuminated letter, which when put together spelled out their name.   

One post read 'One foot in the past...' as another completed '...one foot in the future', before another added: 'Tell me what the future holds Crystal ball.'

After their respective posts a snap showed the members together, as they confirmed their album would be released in late November.

The caption said: 'We couldn't keep it a secret any longer!! 

'Our new album What The Future Holds arrives on November 27th, and it's available to pre-order from 8am tomorrow!'

The band went onto gush that they couldn't wait to go back on the road for their tour.

They said: 'We will never forget the past with Steps, it's what made us, but we've got to look to the future too. We were so thrilled that the last album was a success and it gave us a new lease of life. 

Comeback: The band premiered their new single on BBC Radio 2, with their tour set to take place later in 2021 

Funky: Steps celebrated their comeback by releasing the video for their new single What The Future Holds on Friday

'Performing live has always been our favourite part of being in Steps – we had the most fun of our career on the last tour and we're already planning for the next one to be our biggest spectacle yet.  

'We're also thrilled to have Sophie Ellis-Bextor as our special guest on the What The Future Holds 2021 Tour – her catalogue is full of floor-fillers and she knows how to get any party started. 

'We are so excited for everyone to hear this new album and to come join us on tour.'

Since then Steps have announced their comeback single and shared the video to the catchy tune, What The Future Holds.  

And in a special nod to the past, the beloved pop group brought back their iconic hand moves for the futuristic video which sees them travel to an illuminated city.
