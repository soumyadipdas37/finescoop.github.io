Phillip Schofield's new Waitrose wine is 'only fit for the bin' and not even good enough to cook with, scathing customers have written in their reviews.

The £24.99 price tag has already been slashed to £19.99 for the 2.25 litre boxes of red and white Italian wines bearing the This Morning host's name.

'Only fit for the bin,' wrote one buyer of the red. 'No more palatable than fizzy Ribena.'

Another said: 'Avoid! We couldn't even drink it. Really awful product. Surprised he has put his name to it. Wouldn't even use for cooking.'

Another red drinker said: 'Avoid! We couldn't even drink it. Really awful product. Surprised he has put his name to it. Wouldn't even use for cooking.'

One star reviews for Schofield's white wine on the Waitrose website

The Benevento IGT Falanghina, a white wine from Campania, is described by Schofield as 'clean, with a hint of tropical fruit and just a thread of peach.'

But one reviewer said it was 'very strong white wine with a bitter after taste,' adding that it was 'overpriced.'

Schofield's white has an average of 2.4 stars out of five. 

The Nero di Troia red wine from Puglia is described by Waitrose as 'a real powerhouse red' and that 'just like a Trojan horse, hidden inside this humble box is a powerful, intensely fruity ruby red wine.'

But the £6.67-per-bottle plonk has an average of 2.9 stars out of five.

Schofield is among a raft of celebrities to have produced their own wines, including Brad and Angelina Jolie, Francis Ford Coppola and Cliff Richard.

In the last three months alone, Kylie Minogue has launched her new rosé collection, and actress Cameron Diaz and singer Post Malone have also unveiled their own bottles of pink.

Kylie's £9 Tesco wine has been an immense success and sold out three times since it launched in May to coincide with her 52nd birthday.

Meanwhile, BBC host Graham Norton sold just 12,500 bottles of his New Zealand white in its first year on the shelves in 2014, but total sales have now soared over 5 million.
