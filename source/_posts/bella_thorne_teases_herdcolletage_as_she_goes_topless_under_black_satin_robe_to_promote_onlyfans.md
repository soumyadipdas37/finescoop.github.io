Bella Thorne recently apologized to sex workers on OnlyFans, after her presence on the adult monetization platform caused some trouble.

But the former Disney Channel star is continuing to churn out some relatively mild content for the otherwise X-rated website.

She teased her décolletage Monday, as she went topless under a black satin robe, posting some sexy selfies to her Instagram Story to promote the $20 monthly subscription.

The 22-year-old went for old Hollywood glamour, wearing her red hair in a wavy updo with a dark red smokey eye.

She donned a pearl necklace, layered with a diamond necklace, a pair of pearl earrings and some jewels on her face. 

Bella launched her controversial OnlyFans last month, charging $20 a month, $51 for a three-month subscription or $102 for six months.  

She was reportedly the first content creator on the platform to earn $1million in their first 24 hours, after briefly crashing the site.

The Assassination Nation actress told the Los Angeles Times that she made $2million in the first week, and she's 'putting the earnings into her production company and toward charity.'   

Although the site is mostly for adult entertainers to monetize their work, Thorne tweeted: 'Also nooooo I’m not doing nudity!!!'

But she quickly stirred up controversy, when she charged $200 for nude photos, which weren't actually nude, prompting many users to complain and request refunds.

The site subsequently implemented some unwelcome changes, like capping payments at $50 for pay-per-view posts, as well as a hold that would require some international users to wait 30 days for their payout.

Many sex workers who rely on the platform for their livelihood blamed Bella for making their jobs more difficult.

The Babysitter actress later apologized on Twitter, writing: 'I wanted to bring attention to the site, the more people on the site the more likely of a chance to normalize the stigmas, And in trying to do this I hurt you.

'I have risked my career a few times to remove the stigma behind sex work, porn, and the natural hatred people spew behind anything sex related.' 

She added: 'I am a mainstream face and when you have a voice, a platform, you try to use you in helping others and advocate for something bigger than yourself. Again in this process I hurt you and for that I’m truly sorry.' 

A spokesperson for OnlyFans clarified to BBC: 'Spending limits are in place to protect all OnlyFans users and to allow them to use the platform safely. 

'The newly introduced limits on tips and paid posts is a change that has been in the pipeline for a while, and has not been implemented in response to any one creator or fan.'

Bella told Paper of her reasons for joining the site: 'OnlyFans is the first platform where I can fully control my image; without censorship, without judgement, and without being bullied online for being me.'

She also retweeted a journalist who claimed she joined as research for an upcoming project with director Sean Baker.

The Florida Project director subsequently posted a statement, revealing that the film would be in the 'far future' and nothing was concrete.

He wrote: 'I advised her team to consult with sex workers and address the way she went about this so as NOT to hurt the sex work industry. This has been the extent of my involvement.'

It came after the Famous In Love actress released her own nudes in June of 2019, after she was threatened by a hacker.

Bella posted the screenshots and a note to Twitter: 'F*** u and the power u think you have over me. I'm gonna write about this in my next book. Here's the photos he's been threatening me with, in other words here's my boobies.'
