England international Ainsley Maitland-Niles will prioritise regular first-team football as he agonises over his future at boyhood club Arsenal.

The 23-year-old made his senior international debut against Denmark on Tuesday night and now he’s had a taste of England action, the versatile midfielder is eager to remain at the forefront of Gareth Southgate’s plans - particularly with Euro 2020 just nine months away.

But Maitland-Niles knows he has to be playing regularly if he is to remain in the England fold for the forthcoming international matches.

With that in mind, the Arsenal academy graduate is ready to contemplate the heartbreaking decision of leaving north London to enhance his international chances.

Wolves, who have already had a £15million offer for Maitland-Niles rejected, are understood to be preparing an improved bid.

Maitland-Niles has a strong emotional attachment to the Gunners, who he joined as a six-year-old.

Wolves, managed by Nuno Espirito Santo, are preparing a new offer for Maitland-Niles 

Indeed, the ideal plan for the youngster would be to nail down a regular starting role in Mikel Arteta’s plans and sign a new long-term contract.

But there has been no concrete indications yet that will be the case.

And if that scenario is not forthcoming, then Maitland-Niles is prepared to make the gut-wrenching decision to push for a move elsewhere.

This weekend’s Premier League opener against Fulham could prove pivotal towards how Maitland-Niles views his future.

With Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney expected to be available, Arteta has a selection dilemma on his hands as he picks his wing-backs.

And starting Maitland-Niles on the bench is likely to compound the player’s concerns that he will not play as often as he’d like during the new season.
