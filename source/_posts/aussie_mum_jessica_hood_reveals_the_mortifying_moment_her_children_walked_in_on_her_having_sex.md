A mummy blogger has revealed the hilarious excuse her husband gave when their children walked in on them during intercourse. 

Jessica Hood, 31, from Melbourne, shared the excruciating moment she was caught 'mid-thrust' by her curious kids.

She published the dirty details to her 54,000 followers on her Instagram account 'House of Hoods'.

'Its 9.30pm on a Wednesday what could possibly go wrong?. Little bit of nookie never hurt anyone right?' she began. 

But within seconds everything changed and she heard the door creak and saw the hall light shining on her face.

Mother-of-four Jessica Hood said her kids walked in on her having sex with her husband at home

Ms Hood said her legs were 'sky high' when the children opened the door to her bedroom

At the time her legs were 'sky high' with her husband's 'pasty' behind blocking her from view.   

'I thought my heart couldn't race any faster during such an intimate moment but now I'm on the verge of cardiac arrest,' she said.   

In her panic Ms Hood said she froze in horror.  

'My mum instinct kicked in and I did what anyone else would do in a situation like that. I played dead,' she said. 

'I even threw a little bit of the tongue out the side of my mouth. Lost my dignity and any sense I had too during my most valuable time.

'Reaching around for a blanket Karl flew over me like batman with his cape, hiding any evidence of the act.' 

The young mum said she was hopeful they had been quick enough to cover up to avoid the kids needing 'therapy for life'.  

 Ms Hood and her husband Karl were caught in the act and were quick to make excuses for what they were up to

She told her fans she was so shocked she thought she going into cardiac arrest

Until the children asked what they were doing.  

'We are play fighting, I'm giving mummy a massage,' he husband said.  

But when the kids were told to go to bed, their muffled giggles could be overheard from the corridor. 

'I heard Lily walking off with Logan up the hallway , she * giggles * mum and dad were doing sex,' she said.

'Then Logan let's out a big laugh. Just wonderful! I've scarred my kids for life, either that or I've set them up for a life of 'blackmailing Mummy and Daddy'. 

The mother-of-four said she was hopeful her kids would forget the whole experience. 

'Tomorrow will be an interesting day. I plan to act like nothing happened and stick to 'story',' she said, adding 'if all else fails I could just play dead … right?'
