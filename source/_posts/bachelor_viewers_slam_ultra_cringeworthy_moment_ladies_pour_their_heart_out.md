Thursday night's episode of The Bachelor saw Locky Gilbert's final five suitors declare their love to him in a 'group challenge', after writing their musings down in a journal. 

While the segment may have been an innocent reminder of why they were all on the reality show, fans found the 'toast' too much to bear. 

'OMG who came up with this "challenge"? Ultra cringeworthy,' one fan tweeted. 

'I can't imagine saying any of this!' On Thursday, Bachelor viewers slammed the 'ultra cringeworthy' moment the remaining ladies poured their heart out to Locky Gilbert. Pictured: Irena Srbinvoska 

A second wrote: 'I don't know how I feel about this task. All the girls sucking up to ... oops I mean toast Locky!' before asking: 'Is it [loved-up emoji] or [vomit emoji]?'

'Do you think they got given a book of classic Facebook inspo quotes?' a third said.

'Imagining Bella about to do her vows,' another joked, referring to her lengthy toast.

Sorry! And while the challenge may have been an innocent reminder of why they were all on the reality show, fans found it anything but romantic. Pictured: Bella Varelis

'Do the girls watching also get champers? I feel like that would be the only way to get through these cringe fests,' added another.

Watching from home, one fan argued the challenge was anything but believable.

'These feel more like wedding vows then toast but...' they wrote. 













Not convinced: 'OMG who came up with this "challenge"? Ultra cringeworthy,' one fan tweeted 

In her toast, Bella revealed it was difficult to see other girls share their feelings towards Locky.

'I think it's just weird when you're so invested, you don't really want to see the guy that you like having that strong connection with someone else,' she began.

'I'm telling myself not to not overthink it and not to overlook it because I know how special and strong our connection is.'

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten 

Is she The One? Bella was one of the final five to pour her heart out to Locky on The Bachelor
