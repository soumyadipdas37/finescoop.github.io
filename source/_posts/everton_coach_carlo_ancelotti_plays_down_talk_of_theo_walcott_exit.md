Carlo Ancelotti has played down suggestions Theo Walcott could be set for a transfer-window exit from Everton, but insists he is unfazed at not picking the experienced winger.

The 31-year-old former Arsenal forward has not featured in the last three games and was left out of Ancelotti's squad as they continued their perfect start to the season with a fine 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday, not travelling to Selhurst Park with the rest of the players.

Walcott, who arrived from Arsenal in 2018, has made just one appearance for the Toffees this season, in the 3-0 Carabao Cup win over Salford City.

And the former England forward has been linked with a possible switch to Premier League newcomers Leeds.

With red-hot Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison and new signing James Rodriguez continuing to shine in attack for the Merseysiders, Walcott's chances of breaking into the starting line-up look slim.

But questioned on whether he could leave before the transfer window shuts on October 5, Ancelotti said: 'I don't think so. The problem is the competition is really high in this moment. Sometimes it can happen that a player, like Theo, is not involved.

'Unfortunately, this is the decision I have to take and I am not absolutely happy to take this kind of decision, to leave out a player like Walcott.

'A player who is professional, serious in training and always ready.'

Everton, who lie second on goal difference behind Leicester in the Premier League table with three wins from three, face West Ham in the League Cup on Wednesday and the match could provide Walcott with an opportunity.
