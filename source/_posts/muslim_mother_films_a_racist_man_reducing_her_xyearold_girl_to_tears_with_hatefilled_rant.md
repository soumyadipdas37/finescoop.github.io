Sickening footage has emerged online of a man reducing a little girl to tears after telling her Muslim mother to 'go back to Saudi Arabia'.

The unnamed elderly male was filmed by the victim launching a foul-mouthed Islamophobic rant after he allegedly spotted her wearing a hijab at a bus stop in Bexleyheath, south east London.

When she tried to ignore him, he involved the woman's young daughter and said 'your mum's wrapped up like a turkey' - making her cry.

Despite the child's obvious distress, he continued his hateful tirade and said Muslims did not belong in the UK before telling the woman to 'f*** off'.

The vile abuse was finally stopped when two bus drivers and a fellow commuter stepped in to defend the victims.

Video posted on social media yesterday shows the elderly suspect apparently waiting for a bus before spotting the unidentified victim with her little girl and approaching them.

He says: 'I believe it is Saudi Arabia. If you contradict the government they cut your head off. Would you like to live there, where they do that - cut your head off if you disagree with them?'

When the woman refuses to answer, he tells her little girl: 'Your mum's wrapped up like a turkey.'

The horrified mother then calls him a 'crazy man' to which he replies 'you what?' and walks towards her.

She tells him not to talk to her like that but he shouts in her face: 'Go back to Saudi Arabia. Muslims don't belong here. F*** off.'

A second clip shows the little girl sobbing while her mother hugs her and pleads with her to stop - while the abuser looks on remorseless.

A third clip shows the suspect being confronted over his actions by two bus drivers wearing high-vis jackets - as the little girl continues to cry in the background

Looking for support, he turns to another commuter and says: 'F*** me, she's talking and now here she's crying.'

But the man replies bluntly: 'Mate, you've made her girl cry.'

A third clip shows the suspect being confronted over his actions by two bus drivers wearing high-vis jackets - as the little girl continues to cry in the background.

One of the drivers accuses him of giving the victim 'a load of abuse' but he screams 'she shouldn't be here' before storming off mid-rant.

The Metropolitan Police and Transport for London have been approached for comment.
