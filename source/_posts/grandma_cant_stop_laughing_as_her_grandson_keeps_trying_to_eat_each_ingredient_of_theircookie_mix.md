Christy Hagedorn, from Indiana, shared the clip of her 24-month-old son Cade cooking with his 'Nana' on Facebook. The video has gone viral because Cade would not stop trying to eat all the ingredients for the cookiie mix 

In the video, the grandmother, known as Nana, had to keep a close eye on Cade to keep him from eating the food

People could not get enough of Cade's greedy dives for the baked goods. 

In the clip, the toddler could be seen wearing a chef's hat and white apron while his grandmother asked him if he 'was ready,' propping an empty red plastic bowl in front of him. 

The grandmother, known as 'Nana,' first instructed Cade to add the solid raw butter to the bowl. Soon after, the youngster could be seen plunging his hand into the bowl to taste some of it. 

With a chuckle, Nana had to intercept the bowl, while Cade settled for licking his fingers, full of creamy butter. 

At one point, greedy Cade tried to eat the butter his Nana had just poured into the mixing bowl  

The Nana could not believe that Cade would go back for more, even licking his fingers when she took the bowl away 

Later, Nana handed Cade an empty saucepan which she helped him fill with white sugar. 

Once again, after pouring the content of the saucepan in the bowl, the toddler dipped his fingers into the bowl to taste it. 

When it came time to pour brown sugar into the cookie mix, Cade went straight to the source and licked the brown sugar directly from the saucepan, before pouring it into the red bowl. 

Cade tried to eat butter, sugar, brown sugar and eggs in the short cooking video while his Nana tried to stop him as best as she could  

Caught between panic and laughter, Nana could be seen trying her best to keep her grandson from eating all the raw ingredients of the cookie mix. 

She moved on to showing him how to break the eggs into the red bowl. However,  Cade once again tried to get a taste of the action by catching some of the yoke on its tiny fingers. 

For the Nana, this was the last straw, Holding him with both hands so he would not eat more of the mix, she could not stop laughing as Cade gleefully licked his fingers once more. 

'We don't eat the eggs,' she could be heard saying, between fits of laughter. 

The video was shared on all popular social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Cade's Instagram page, managed by his mother Christy.
