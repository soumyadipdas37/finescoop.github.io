In the world of fast fashion, it's often easy to ignore old clothes that sit in your drawers and snap up brand new versions instead. 

However, Ireland-based online magazine MetDaan Fashion has come up 11 DIY home dyes - using ingredients you might have in your cupboard or fridge - that promise to breathe new life into tired garments.

The expert tips help people dye clothes using natural resources, including drawing out colours from herbs, spices and berries to get a hue that sticks to clothes. 

Here's how to do it:  

COPPER COINS FOR BLUE

Soaking copper pennies or cents in water releases a blue dye which can be poured over clothing to transform it.

Once added to the coins, the water will begin to turn blue and leaving them in there for as long as week can create a brighter colour. 

Once the water turns a deep blue colour, clothes can be left to soak in the liquid before rinsing it off when you've achieved your desired hue.  

Soaking a large collection of pennies in water will release a blue substance into the water and creates a dye which can be poured over clothes 

AVOCADO SKINS FOR RED

Instead of throwing away your avocado scraps, you can make a beautiful red dye for your clothes. 

First remove all the flesh and rub the stones with a damp cloth then boil the leftovers in a pan.

Once the red dye has been released, dunk your clothes into the mixture until you achieve your desired colour and rinse it in cool water before hanging to dry. 

Once boiled in water, avocado leftovers will release a red substance, making a perfect reddish dye

PURPLE GRAPES FOR PURPLE 

Place a bunch of purple grapes inside a pair of old tights and pour boiling water over them in a bowl or tub. 

The pigment from the grapes will be drawn out and create a purple clothes dye. 

Leave the clothing in the mixture overnight and wake up to find your rejuvenated clothes.

ROSEMARY SPRIGS FOR YELLOW 

Put your clothes in need of a makeover into a saucepan with some sprigs of the herb rosemary.

Once the mixture begins boiling, a yellow substance will begin to seep into the boiling water and dye the clothes. 

Clothes should be left in the liquid for at least 45 minutes to give a yellow tinge.

Once your timer goes off, turn the heat off, let it cool and strain it well.

In just half an hour your dye will have set in to your clothes and they will be transformed to a brand new wardrobe staple.

The easy natural dyeing process is perfect for turning your favourite discoloured white t-shirt yellow.

EUCALYPTUS LEAVES FOR ORANGE 

Removing the leaves from a eucalyptus plant and covering them in boiling water will release tannins - making an orange pigment.

In order to create your own deep red dye, boil the leaves for a few minutes and then turn down the heat to a gentle simmer for 50 minutes. 

To then make the ultimate red garment, leave it to simmer in the water for a further 50 minutes.

COFFEE FOR INVIGORATING JEAN COLOUR 

If your jeans have faded over time, leaving them to soak in coffee for half an hour can give them a much needed pick-me-up. 

As well as perking you up in the morning, coffee can also perk up jeans - with the darker the roast the better the finish. 

Once your favourite pair have been soaked for 30 minutes, rinse them off before placing them on a delicate cycle in your washing machine.

BLACKBERRIES FOR DEEP RED 

Crushing some blackberries and adding some water will release the colour from the fruit, making the perfect bottle of spray dark red dye.

Combining the blackberries and water and bringing it to a a low simmer for 20-30 minutes - ensuring it does not boil over or overheat - will make the deep red dye. 

Making sure to stir it every so often, allow the clothes to sit in the water for 1-2 hours or even overnight.
