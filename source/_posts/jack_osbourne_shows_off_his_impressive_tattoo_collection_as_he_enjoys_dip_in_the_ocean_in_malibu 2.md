Earlier this month, in an interview on Hollywood Raw with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn, Jack's sister Kelly revealed that back in 2017, she'd turned to her brother for help when she hit rock bottom. with her drinking. 

'I was a functioning alcoholic,' the 35-year-old admitted. 'Full blown functioning alcoholic. I kept my job; I kept my friends. What it was for me, what I reached a spiritual low where I was just so morbidly unhappy and lost and directionless and just broken in every way.' 

Kelly explained: 'I remember I picked up the phone August 8, 2017, and called my brother and I said 'I'm done, I need some help, can you come to get me? I don't want to be a fat drunk loser anymore; I want to be a skinny winner.' I was ready to work on myself and I did it.' 

As part of her new focus, she underwent gastric sleeve surgery and has since lost 85lbs.
