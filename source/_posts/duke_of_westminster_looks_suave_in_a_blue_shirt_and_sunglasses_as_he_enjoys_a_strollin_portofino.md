It's a playground for the rich and famous with luxurious yachts permanently docked in the harbour - so naturally Portofino is the ideal spot for Prince George's billionaire godfather, the Duke of Westminster.

Still enjoying a summer break, Hugh Grosvenor, 29, was spotted taking a stroll through the Italian village today, while doing some shopping.

The socialite, who inherited his title and estate from his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of Westminster, upon his death in 2016, looked suave in a blue shirt and sunglasses.

It is thought he is enjoying his Mediterranean holiday with several friends and his mother Natalia, who is also Prince William's godmother.

The duke teamed his low-key attire with a blue trousers and bright green trainers, while enjoying a shopping trip through the coastline village.

The family holidayed in the same resort in 2017 and 2019, which is famed for its harbour packed full of lavish superyachts.

Hugh became Britain's youngest billionaire after inheriting £9.3billion following his father Gerald's sudden death in 2016. 

Hugh also inherited 300 acres across London's Mayfair and Belgravia – two of the most expensive areas in the world – as well as estates in Oxford, Scotland and properties around the globe - including the 10,872-acre family estate at Eaton Hall in Cheshire.

He hit headlines earlier this year after pledging £12.5million to help the NHS in its fight against coronavirus.

The Duke donated £2.5million to the Health Service when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, but said he was so 'humbled' by the work of doctors and nurses he wanted to give another £10million. 

He donated most of his money to NHS Charities Together, to provide respite, rehabilitation and mental health assistance to NHS staff and their families.

Hugh is close friends with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the youngest of Prince George's godparents. 

His father Gerald Grosvenor had surgery to remove a tumour from his lung in July 2013. The operation was said to have been a success and he apparently made a good recovery. 

But Hugh lost his father three years later in August 2016 after he suffered a sudden heart attack while out on a country walk, aged 64.
