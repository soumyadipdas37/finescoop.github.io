Christine and Frank Lampard made the most of their quality time on Tuesday afternoon as the new Premier League season draws ever nearer. 

With Chelsea legend Frank returning to the Stamford Bridge dugout in less than a week, the couple made a joint appearance in London. 

Sporting a breezy patterned dress, Christine, 41, caught the eye as they climbed from their powerful Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon.

Joining his wife, Frank, also 42, looked relaxed in a short sleeved blue shirt and matching cargo trousers while pulling on his jacket. 

The couple appeared to be in high spirits as they took advantage of a rare joint appearance without their 23-month old daughter Patricia. 

While Christine continues her presenting duties with daytime shows Lorraine and Loose Women, Frank has been busy rebuilding the Chelsea squad with some big money signings ahead of their first game away to Brighton and Hove Albion.

The Chelsea coach has been married to Christine since 2015, and he recently told The High Performance Podcast that she offers him sensible advice about how to manage his team.

Frank - who also starred for Chelsea before he turned to coaching - said: 'She definitely coaches me. And I do throw a lot of things off Christine.

'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home [and ask].

'It's a different view, a different opinion.'

Let's go: Chelsea and England legend Frank was behind the wheel as they set off later that day 

Frank admits he values Christine's outlook on some of the situations he faces on a day-to-day basis, and the former England star is happy to approach his wife for tips.

He said: 'Sometimes, I go, "Christine, what do you think about this problem? I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday. But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?"

'And she goes, "Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them." And I'm like, "yeah".  I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'

Christine also ensures Frank doesn't become overly-obsessive about his coaching role.

He added: 'Christine has a bit of a joke with me at home when we're watching football constantly all the time.

'She does reflect on the fact that it's only kicking a ball ... She's almost like, you're becoming really, really intense about this, and maybe not seeing a bit of clarity in this instance.'
