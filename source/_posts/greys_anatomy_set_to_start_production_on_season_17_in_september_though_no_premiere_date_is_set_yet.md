ABC's long-running drama series Grey's Anatomy is gearing up to go back to work, with production now slated to begin in September.

Production has been on pause for Grey's Anatomy, and most other TV shows, though Variety reports filming on Season 17 may begin in Los Angeles as early as next week. 

ABC has not yet solidified a premiere date for Grey's Anatomy, but it is just the latest of several network shows to return, which could give ABC a decided advantage.

Other ABC shows such as The Goldbergs, A Million Little Things, The Good Doctor and Big Sky have been confirmed to return to production.

Grey's Anatomy cut its 16th Season short by four episodes when production halted industry-wide in March due to COVID-19.

While ABC hasn't confirmed when filming will begin, series star Ellen Pompeo herself teased filming could start soon in a tweet.

When a fan asked when production was starting, Pompeo stated, 'The plan is to start in a few weeks but don’t have an exact start date but @msdebbieallen is prepping!'

ABC had initially slated Grey's Anatomy in its traditional Thursday night 8 PM time slot for this fall, but that quickly changed.

The network revealed last week that the bulk of their fall schedule will be comprised of unscripted programming, including Leslie Jones' Supermarket Sweep.

Grey's Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff revealed during a TV Academy panel that the new season will 'address this pandemic for sure.'

'There’s no way to be a long-running medical show and not do the medical story of our lifetimes,' Vernoff said during the panel.

'I feel like our show has an opportunity and a responsibility to tell some of those stories,' she added.

Vernoff added that the show regularly brings in a panel of doctors to discuss their experiences each year, and the stories they told this year were unlike any other.

'“(The doctors) are literally shaking and trying not to cry, they’re pale, and they’re talking about it as war — a war that they were not trained for,' Vernoff said.

'And that’s been one of our big conversations about Owen (Kevin McKidd), is that he’s actually trained for this in a way that most of the other doctors aren’t,' she added.
