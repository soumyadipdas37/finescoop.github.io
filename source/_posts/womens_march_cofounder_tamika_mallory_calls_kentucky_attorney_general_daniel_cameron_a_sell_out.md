Tamika Mallory, the co-founder of the Women's March, has harshly criticized Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, comparing him to 'sell-out Negroes' who participated in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. 

Mallory spoke at a press conference in Louisville, Kentucky on Friday, where she blasted Cameron over a grand jury's decision not to directly charge officers in Breonna Taylor's killing. 

'Daniel Cameron is no different than the sell-out N**roes that sold our people into slavery and helped white men capture our people to abuse them and to traffic them,' she said. 'That is who you are Daniel Cameron.

'You are a sell-out, and you were used by the system to harm your own mama, your own Black mama,' she continued. 'We have no respect for you, no respect for your black skin because all of our skinfolk ain't our kinfolk and you do not belong to black people at all.'

'Daniel Cameron is no different than the sell-out N**roes that sold our people into slavery,' said Women's March co-founder Tamika Mallory at a press conference on Friday

Cameron is Kentucky's first black attorney general, and is considered to be a rising star in the Republican party. He was included on President Donald Trump's shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees, and praised by the president, who said he handled the Taylor case 'very well'.

On Wednesday, Cameron announced the grand jury findings in Taylor's March 13 death. She was fatally shot by police during a drug raid, after cops returned fire when her boyfriend shot at and struck one officer.

Cameron presented the evidence to a state grand jury, which found Taylor's shooting death justified. The grand jury indicted one of the three officers who opened fire for wanton endangerment, over alleged wild shots that entered a neighboring apartment. 

Mallory pointed out that Cameron announced the grand jury finding on September 23, the same date that in 1955 an all-white jury acquitted two defendants in the murder of Emmett Till, a black boy who was lynched in Mississippi.

On Wednesday, Cameron announced the grand jury findings in Taylor's March 13 death. The grand jury did not directly charge officers with her killing

'Now I don't know if it's just that Daniel Cameron is stupid or that he is very, very, very clear about history and made a decision to wait six months and come forward with this announcement, this garbage that we received on the exact same day that Emmett Till's family received the same results,' she said. 

A spokesperson for Cameron's office said that he understands that the outcome of the grand jury proceedings was not what protesters had hoped for.

'Regarding today's statements at the press conference, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but prosecutors and Grand Jury members are bound by the facts and by the law,' the spokesperson said in a statement. 

'Attorney General Cameron is committed to doing everything he can to ensure the integrity of the prosecution before him and continue fulfilling his ethical obligations both as a prosecutor and as a partner in the ongoing federal investigation.'
