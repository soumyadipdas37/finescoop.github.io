Last week, Mandy Moore revealed she is expecting her first child early next year with husband Taylor Goldsmith. 

And one week later, the actress was spotted stepping out solo while sporting a gorgeous floral patterned dress.

The 36-year-old covered up her midsection in the stylish frock, adding a coordinating red handbag for her Wednesday outing.

The dress featured burgundy and white tones with ruching along the torso and above her growing baby bump.

Mandy's frock also had puffy shoulders with delicate sleeves and a high-neck. 

She paired it with brown braided sandals with a red cross-body bag, adding vintage inspired sunglasses; the mom-to-be wore a mask with her brunette tresses loose in waves around her. 

The This Is Us star's outing comes just one week after she shared her baby news with her 4.3m Instagram followers - along with sweet maternity photos.

Mandy and her musician husband posed for the darling black and white photos - while he embraced her growing baby bump - for the Thursday post.

'Baby Boy Goldsmith coming early 2021,' she captioned the photos alongside a blue heart emoji. 

Mandy and Taylor, 35,  started dating in 2015, and announced their engagement in September 2017.  

The couple married in 2018 and will celebrate their second wedding anniversary this November.

She beamed a bright smile as her Dawes frontman husband placed his hand on her belly in a sweater over a light collard shirt and dark slacks. 

Back in 2017, Mandy told E! 'I want kids sooner than later,' as she discussed her breakout character Rebecca Pearson on the hit NBC show. 

'I was most concerned about was feeling maternal,' she said at the time of her character being a loving mother-of-three. 'Not having children myself. But being part of a project like this definitely makes my ovaries start kicking.'

Most recently, for the singer's 35th birthday in August, she wrote on Instagram 'I’m not sure what I did in a past life to deserve you but it must have been something big.' 

Adding: 'You are undeniable. Your inherent light, humility, grace, humor, and compassion are contagious and I feel lucky to get the chance to bask in your goodness with outstretched arms.'

She may have hinted at her then very early pregnancy as she continued: '2020 has certainly been a wild ride but I really can’t wait for what this next year will bring.' 

For her 36th birthday in April, Taylor equally shared his love for his wife. 

'To say I’m grateful would be the understatement of my life,' he wrote at the time on Instagram. He went on to call her 'the most incredible human being on the planet.'
