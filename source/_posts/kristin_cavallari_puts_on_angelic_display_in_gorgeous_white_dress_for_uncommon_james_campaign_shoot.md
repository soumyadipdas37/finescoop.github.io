Kristin Cavallari has had quite the year, as she divorces husband-of-seven-years Jay Cutler amid the cancellation of her show Very Cavallari.

But the reality TV personality is keeping herself busy, as she stays on top of her jewelry and apparel line.

She put on an angelic display Tuesday in a gorgeous white sleeveless dress, as she gave a behind-the-scenes look at the spring/summer '21 campaign shoot for her brand Uncommon James.

The 33-year-old donned a white sundress with a laced-up bodice and an ankle-length billowy skirt.

She struck some poses on an outdoor concrete staircase, showing some leg and a pair of worn white Chuck Taylor All-Stars.

Kristin gave a glimpse of the shoes in a Boomerang, writing: 'Big fan of the shoes for this shoot. Comfort.'

She later posted another Boomerang in the same shoes, as she modeled a white lace off-the-shoulder mini dress.

She recently opened up to Insider about co-parenting with Jay, 37: 'I don't have any advice because I think every situation is different. 

'But I think that Jay and I are navigating through it in the best way possible and we're figuring it out. Some days are good and some days are bad, but we're making the most of the situation and putting our kids first.'

Kristin and the retired NFL quarterback tied the knot in June of 2013, and they share sons Camden Jack, eight, Jaxon Wyatt, six, and daughter Saylor James, four.

She added that their kids are their first priority: 'They're the only things I care about right now. And so I'm removing any of my emotions or feelings and just thinking about them and putting them first.'
