Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho has told chairman Daniel Levy to begin negotiations over Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard, according to reports.

Academy product Lingard has made just two substitute appearances in the Premier League since February and was not named in United's squad as they lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace in their season opener on Saturday.

Lingard scored 13 goals in 48 matches under Mourinho during his best campaign for United in the 2017/18 season.

The forward is thought to have been unsettled by his lack of first-team opportunities at United

He went on to reach the 2018 World Cup semi-finals with England but has scored only five Premier League goals since then.

Discussions between intermediaries have begun after Mourinho urged Levy to make enquiries, ESPN says. 

Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg will reportedly rival Spurs for his signature, although Mourinho may need to move midfielder Dele Alli on in order to sign the 27-year-old.

27-year-old Lingard has been at United for 20 years and has scored a total of 33 goals for them

Tottenham have brought in Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid and are looking to add more firepower to support Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.

Kane and Son scored 42 of the club's 81 goals last season but misfired in the lacklustre 1-0 opening day defeat to Everton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last Sunday.

Lingard has scored 33 goals in 207 appearances for United and four goals in 24 senior international matches.

He has not been named in an England squad since being left out of the Euro 2020 qualifiers last October.
