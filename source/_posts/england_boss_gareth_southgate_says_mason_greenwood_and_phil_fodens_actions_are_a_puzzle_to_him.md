Gareth Southgate has revealed that he would have sent Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood home for their misconduct in inviting girls back to England's team hotel in Reykjavik even if the squad had not been living in a bio-secure bubble due.

The England manager described the pair's behaviour as 'unacceptable on any basis' after the  goal-less draw with Denmark, a disappointing spectacle that was completely overshadowed by the scandal that erupted on the eve of the game.

Greenwood joined Foden in offering a public apology on Tuesday, but both players will have to offer more than words to regain the trust of Southgate and the rest of the England management team.

Gareth Southgate has spoken out about Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood's antics in Iceland

Greenwood and Foden (pictured) broke protocols and have been fined after they snuck two girls into their hotel room in Iceland, breaking their covid-19 bubble

Southgate said: 'I do not really understand how players could have felt that behaviour was acceptable. That is a puzzle to me. 

'What is clear is that we are talking about a COVID breach. When we knew about that, we had to act quickly. 

'What has emerged since is that whether it was COVID or not, they would have been going home. Everyone has to be aware that is not going to be tolerated in an England camp.'

'It's been a pretty normal week, as far as I can see! I am resilient to it, really. I was determined to see that we came out of here with something. 

'We were not going to fold. We showed we were a team of men. We should not have been playing, frankly. I have to praise the effort of everyone. The last three weeks have been mayhem.'

Southgate says Foden and Greenwood actions were in Iceland 'were a puzzle' to the manager

Despite being disappointed with their actions in Iceland he said that they need help to rebuild. 

'I have spoken to both of them,' Southgate said. 'As I said yesterday they know what has happened is unacceptable. It was unacceptable on a COVID basis, but as I have learned more details it is unacceptable on any basis. Either way they would have gone home.

'They are young men that need consequences being there. But they now need support because they are everywhere in the press, everybody is wading in on them and they need help to rebuild. 

It is not certain whether the Manchester City and United stars will be called up in October

'The need to understand the expectations of being an England player and we have to help them on that process. That is going to take time and we need to build some trust. 

'But you have to help young people get back on their feet and that is important part of what we need to do as well.'

Southgate is unlikely to impose further disciplinary sanctions, but stopped short of promising an immediate return to the squad for next month's games against Wales, Denmark and Iceland.

'There is a lot of thinking and a lot of trust needs to be built first, but my mind-set is not to hurt these boys anymore,' he said. 

'They are going through that with their families, they are going through that with their friends and I don't need to add into that.'
