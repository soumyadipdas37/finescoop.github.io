Sarah Ferguson has announced she is 'so excited' to be releasing a 'fun' cookbook filled with recipes for the whole family to enjoy. 

The Duchess of York, 60, who has been staying at Royal Lodge in Windsor since the beginning of lockdown, revealed the news on her official Instagram page - before sharing how thrilled she is about the new venture. 

The royal will be collaborating with Laleh Mohmedi, the mother behind the viral sensation, Jacob's Food Diaries.  

The exact release date for the cookbook, called Fergie's Fun Food, is still unknown, though Laleh's social media says it will launch in 2021.

Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice's mother has been keeping children entertained amid the coronavirus pandemic with her Fergie and Friends YouTube series.

In recent weeks, she's been sharing glimpses of her cooking talents on her channel - including the likes of peanut butter toast-shaped bears and gingerbread men. 

Some of her best recipes, which she claimed will be easy to recreate, will be shared in the book, which is part of Serenity Press Duchess Collection.  

The book, Fergie claimed, will entertain both parents and children with fun recipes.

The Duchess of York said she was 'excited' to be working on the new fun food book with Laleh Mohmedi 

The royal will be collaborating with Laleh Mohmedi, a mother who rose to fame after sharing her son's whimsical snacks online.

Laleh created Jacob's Food Diaries which has since became a successful business, working alongside major companies such as Disney, Nickelodeon, Universal pictures and Jamie Oliver. 

Back in February, it was revealed that Sarah Ferguson had signed a seven-book deal with the publisher, and that her work would be aimed at a children audience. 

Sarah said she was 'so excited' about the news as she unveiled three of her upcoming children's books on Instagram.

The Duchess of York, who has written over 25 books over the years, revealed the children's stories earlier today, including one titled 'The Enchanted Oak Tree' and another called 'Genie Gems'.

After posting the covers on her Instagram, friends and family were quick to congratulate the Duchess, including Princess Beatrice's, 31, fiancé Edo who commented on the post with three yellow heart emojis.

Fergie has also read one of her children books during her Storytime with Fergie and Friends channel on Youtube, where she reads one children's book a day. 

The Budgie the Little Helicopter series - which charts the adventures of a little hero helicopter who rushes around rescuing people - became a lucrative creation for the duchess, and the books were turned into a TV cartoon. 

Fergie has also penned the successful Little Red series.
