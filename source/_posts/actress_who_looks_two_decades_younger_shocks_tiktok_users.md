Big reveal: In her TikTok video, which has been viewed 2.4million times, Tris is seen wearing a Barbie jumper with her hair pulled back in a half updo to reveal her unlined complexion

'I have always looked young for my age. When I was younger people would tell me I would appreciate that once I got older and it’s definitely a blessing. I don’t hate it. I’m thankful.'

In her TikTok video, which has been viewed 2.4million times, Tris is seen wearing a Barbie jumper with her hair pulled back in a half updo to reveal her unlined complexion. 

She faces away from the camera before turning around to smile as a subtitle reveals she is 40 years old. In the caption she jokes: 'In high school I looked like I was a kid.'

The revelation prompted widespread shock in the comments, with one fan writing: 'Why do I look older than you and I'm only 24?'

Another posted: 'No, you're not 40! You don't even look 30! Wow!'  A third added: 'No way. I thought you were 22!' 



'She's found the fountain of youth!' Fans could not get over how young Tris, pictured, looks  

A fourth TikTok user wrote: 'She must be hiding the fountain of youth! You're so beautiful'. 

Speaking to FEMAIL, Tris explained she thinks the key to looking younger is to start taking care of your skin when you are young - and to 'live as happily as you can'. 

She said: 'I started using anti-aging creams when I was 21. I think it helps tremendously to start early on taking care of yourself. I also always use sunscreen. 

'And I’ve never smoked or drank alcohol. I’ve tried a ton of different products but the one that’s made the biggest difference for me has been the Purity line from PHILOSOPHY. It’s super gentle on your skin but my skin has literally never been smoother. My skin loves it!

'I also believe even when times are tough you should do whatever you can to laugh. Even something as simple as watching a comedy can help boost your mood and I definitely believe your mood and keeping your stress down as much as possible helps me stay youthful. 

'Life is short! Live as happily as you can while you can and that happiness will radiate out.'

She added that her youthful appearance helps her professionally because she can be cast as younger characters. 

She said: 'I don’t think it’s hindered my acting career at all in fact, in many ways it gives me the advantage of having the looks to play a younger character, but the maturity And experience that comes in handy to play more challenging roles, and my agents are able to cast me in roles ranging anywhere from 20-30.'
