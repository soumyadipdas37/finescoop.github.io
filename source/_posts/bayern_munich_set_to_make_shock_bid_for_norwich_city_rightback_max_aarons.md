Bayern Munich are considering a bid for Norwich City right-back Max Aarons.

The European champions saw Ajax full-back Sergino Dest reject their advances over the weekend and opt for a move to Barcelona where he is due for a medical on Tuesday.

Barca had also approached Norwich over a deal for Aarons but their offer of a loan with the option to buy for £20million was rejected with the Championship side demanding a guaranteed fee.

Aarons had been lined up by Barcelona since June with former sports director Eric Abidal involved in negotiations. However, following Abidal's departure, and Barca's inability to agree terms with Norwich, Ronald Koeman identified Dest as his next best option.

Bayern had hoped to sign Dest but have always had Aarons on their list of options and are weighing up an offer.

The 20-year-old Aarons also has interest from Roma and AC Milan who have been discussing figures with Tottenham for Serge Aurier.

Bayern are in talks with Leeds United over a move for their midfielder Michael Cuisance

Meanwhile, Bayern are expecting further talks with Leeds United this week over a proposed move for their midfielder Michael Cuisance.

The talented 21-year-old was surprisingly left out of Hansi Flick's side as they lost 4-1 to Hoffenheim on Sunday which has raised expectation that they will listen to offers this week.

Leeds have been targeting a number of players for their midfield with Norwich City's Todd Cantwell another they admire.

They also want to add a winger with talks underway with Utrecht for Gyrano Kerk while Leicester City's Demarai Gray is also on their radar. 

Daniel James has told Manchester United he wants to stay and fight for his place. The Wales international is likely to take stock of his situation in January if he fails to get a run of games but he is expected to figure against Brighton
