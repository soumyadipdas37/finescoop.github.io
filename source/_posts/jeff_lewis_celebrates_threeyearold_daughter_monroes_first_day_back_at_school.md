Jeff Lewis celebrated daughter Monroe's first day back at school in a sweet Instagram photo on Thursday.

The toddler looked angelic as she posed outside wearing a yellow dress while holding onto a little cow doll and smiling brightly.

While Monroe, three, went to learn Jeff, 50, took a walk around the neighborhood with his on-again boyfriend Scott Anderson and their two dogs.

The Flipping Out designer and his partner were in sporty duds as they lead their pups around.

Jeff was still wearing a brace around his neck, as he continued to recover from surgery for the spinal cord condition.

Lewis was likely happy to have a bit of time on his hands while Monroe went to school.

Hopefully this school year will be less dramatic than her last.

Poor Monroe was actually expelled from her Montessori preschool last fall after her father Jeff criticized the school on his Radio Andy Show Jeff Lewis Live.

Then at her next school, Jeff claimed that his daughter was bullied by another toddler who pushed her down on the playground.

All the while, the Bravo house flipper and ex Gage Edward are still locked in a custody battle over Monroe.

Lewis and Edward separated in January 2019. Lewis announced they had officially split in February.

Last month the reality personality revealed that Edward served him with court documents requesting legal support, equal shared custody of Monroe along with a request to change her legal name from Monroe Christine Lewis to Monroe Christine Edward Lewis.

But Jeff told his listeners he doesn't think Gage can 'handle' 50/50 custody. 

'The reason, in my opinion, he wants 50 percent custody is because he wants maximum child support. If that is the case, let's sit down. I'll be far more generous if we could just sit down and work it out,' he said. 'But I'm fighting for the best interest of my child.' 

'Gage and I, I think we're coparenting fine together. I'm very careful, I never say anything negative about him [in front of Monroe]. I actually think he's a good dad. A really good dad!' he added. 'But I don't think he can handle any more than what he's got going on.'

'My child's with me 70 percent of the time. She's happy. She's well-adjusted,' he said.
