She celebrated turning 39 last week by sharing a racy bikini snap on her Instagram.

But it was back to the day job for Ashley Roberts on Monday, as she was spotted heading home from her daily stint reporting showbiz news on Heart radio. 

The Pussycat doll lit up the drab London day in a flattering all-cream outfit that dazzled onlookers.

Ashley's tight-fitting dress accentuated her enviable curves and showed off plenty of leg.

The When I Grow Up songstress wore her platinum tresses loose as she stormed along the pavement in stiletto heels. 

She accessorised her look with a smart Yves Saint Laurent handbag, and retro 60s-style shades. 

There was just a hint of a smile as the Don't Cha hitmaker walked along, before she got in her taxi to head home.

At this time a week before,  Ashley admitted she had been spoiled with cakes, champagne and cards from her extended family at the radio station after turning up for her role as showbiz correspondent.

The singer shared an Instagram video showing a caterpillar cake, a sumptuous-looking white chocolate creation, a bottle of Taittinger champagne and Hypnotiq fruit liqueur to kick off her day of celebrations. 

The star's birthday appearance came after she revealed she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future.

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine in July, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29.

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.
