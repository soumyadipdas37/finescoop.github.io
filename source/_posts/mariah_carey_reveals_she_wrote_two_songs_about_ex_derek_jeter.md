Mariah Carey isn't afraid to kiss and tell in her upcoming memoir, where she details her fling with former MLB star Derek Jeter, the end of her marriage to music exec Tommy Mottola and more.

The Heartbreaker songstress, 50, teased details about her book The Meaning Of Mariah Carey during a new Vulture interview, telling reporter Allison P. Davis how meeting Jeter helped her 'get past' her tumultuous five-year marriage to Mottola. 

Carey also revealed how her song The Roof was about her first kiss with the former NY Yankee, telling the site: 'I can never forget that moment.'

Vulture writer Davis was able to read Carey's tome ahead of their interview, giving her special insight into the Butterfly singer.

In the book, Mariah writes about meeting Jeter at a party near the end of her marriage with Mottola. 

After they hit it off, the pair began 'secretly' texting, leading to a rendezvous on the roof of his apartment, where they finally kissed. 

The moment was immortalized in her song The Roof (Back In Time), which features the chorus: 'Every time I feel the need / I envision you caressing me / And go back in time / To relive the splendor of you and I / On the rooftop that rainy night.'

Mariah said the memory is still burned in her brain, telling Vulture: 'Of course I do! I can never forget that moment.'

All-Star hunk: The Heartbreaker songstress, 50, said meeting Jeter helped her 'get past' her five-year marriage to Sony CEO Tommy Mottola, who she was still with when she met Jeter (above in 1996)

'I mean, it's not like it was some intensely deep, intellectually stimulating — again, it was a great moment, and it happened in a divine way because it helped me get past living there, in Sing Sing [her nickname for Mottala's house,] under those rules and regulations.'

The Roof wasn't the only track inspired by her romance with Jeter. 

Mariah also revealed her sensual R&B hit My All was about 'risking her life to have a night with Jeter in Puerto Rico,' according to the magazine.

The lyrics 'I'd risk my life to feel / Your body next to mine' were serious for the star, who said she truly worried for her well-being under former Sony CEO Mottola's watch.

Domineering: Mariah called ex Tommy Mottola like 'an oppressive humidity,' explaining how she felt like he had her every move monitored during their 1993 to 1998 marriage. They're seen in 1996 above

'He was like this oppressive humidity,' she told Vulture, after writing about how he monitored her with 'security cameras she says were always watching her and the security team she felt was reporting her every move.'  

Mariah and Mottola married in 1993 after starting their relationship during the production of her sophomore album Music Box in 1992 and 1993.

Their 20-year-age difference and professional relationship made for a tense dynamic, but Carey says she was more than generous with her portrayal of him in the book.

Not even the worst of it: Though she's candid about Tommy in the book, Mariah said she held back, telling Vulture 'I could have gone harder.' They're seen in 1996 above

'I could have gone harder,' she said.  'And I didn't. I give him credit where credit is due.'
