Kai Havertz has been training with his new Chelsea team-mates for the first time after sealing a record £89million move from Bayer Leverkusen on Friday. 

The 21-year-old attacking midfielder was this week unveiled as Frank Lampard's latest signing, and Blues coaches were putting him through his paces at Cobham on Saturday morning.

The German joins Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Xavier Mbuyamba, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva and Kai Havertz in signing for the Blues this summer, tking the club's spending to approximately £230m.
