She told her 12.6million Instagram followers: 'My boyfriend got me these balloons that said "congrats," but the wind blew them away.'

'I love you baby,' she laughed, as Reum, 39, attempted to pull the mylar balloons from a palm tree by the pool.

Paris also posted a video of silver cake, which was printed with the promotional image for the documentary and 'congrats' in white icing.

Shortly after, she posted another video without the robe, as she paced around the house with a heart-eye sunglasses face filter.

Paris said: 'Hey guys, I'm currently at home, freaking out. My movie is about to play in 20 minutes. You guys are literally about to see every deep, dark secret I've ever not told anyone in my life. So, um... yeah.

'Little nerve-racking, but I will be on live to answer your questions. So, swipe up, and This Is Paris starts in 19 minutes. Yas!' 

She's recently been sharing some of those 'deep, dark secrets' ahead of the premiere, including her experience with abuse at a Utah boarding school, as well as her past abusive relationships.

The House of Wax actress recently told The Hollywood Reporter of the film: 'I've been through a lot and I've been through a lot of very traumatic experiences that people can't even imagine. I've never discussed it with anyone, like literally no one, not my family, not my friends. 

'Things I talk about in this film are things that nobody knows. People, when they see the film, are going to see and I think understand me and how it shaped the woman that I am today because of those experiences that I went through.'
