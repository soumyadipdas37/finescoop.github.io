LeBron James has given his thoughts on Lori Loughlin's punishment for her role in the college admissions scandal.

With news breaking this week that Loughlin, 56, will be able to spend her two-month sentence at the prison of her choosing, James took to Instagram to air his feelings on the matter.

Posting a picture of the disgraced actress from a Vanity Fair article, the basketball player, 35, said in the caption that the situation made 'no damn sense to me.'

In response to the quoted headline which read 'Lori Loughlin will get to serve her two-month sentence at the prison of her choice', James wrote, 'Of her what!!???'

'I’m laughing cause sometimes you have to just to stop from crying!' he continued.  

'Don’t make no damn sense to me. We just want the same treatment if committed of same crime that’s all. Is that asking for to much??? Let me guess, it is huh. Yeah I know!!

'We'll just keep pushing forward and not expecting the handouts! STRONG, BLACK & POWERFUL!' he concluded, along with emojis for prayer hands, a raised fist and a crown. 

The post elicited almost 2 million likes within nine hours of being posted, and drew comments from famous contemporaries such as rappers T.I. and 50 Cent, who chimed in with the phrase 'Sounds about white'.

Page Six reports that Loughlin, along with her husband Mossimo Giannulli, have been granted permission to carry out their respective prison terms at lush his-and-hers California federal prisons that are low-security facilities offering everything from origami classes to lessons in accordion and ukulele.

'Cartoon drawing, crochet, leather craft and ceramics are also on offer,' the reports says of the Federal Correctional Institution in Victorville, along with career development support and much more.  

The prison is also within two hours of Loughlin's newly-purchased $9.5 million mansion in the Hidden Hills gated community just west of Los Angeles. 

Previously, the fallen star had expressed her deep fears of having to go to prison during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March of 2019, Loughlin, Giannulli along with some 50 other individuals – including actress Felicity Huffman – were charged with fraud- and bribery-related offenses in relation to the 'Varsity Blues' college admissions scandal. 

The pair paid $500,000 to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella into USC.

They pretended their daughters were star athletes, when they'd never rowed crew.

The TV star went on to be embroiled in a months-long legal battle, one in which she first tried to maintain her innocence.

In the interim, Huffman pleaded guilty to her charges and carried out her own prison sentence last fall in Dublin, California, serving just 11 days of a two-week sentence.

And this May, Lori pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail, leading to her being sentenced to two months in jail.

Both Loughlin and Giannulli hope to stagger their sentences to allow one parent to be home for their daughters.

They each have 90 days from their sentencing last month to report to prison.
