The owner of a bar attended by one of Queensland's accused quarantine dodgers claims she has cost his business $100,000.

Olivia Muranga attended Cowch Bar in Brisbane's Southbank the day after having a coronavirus test in June when she fell sick following her trip to Melbourne.

The 20-year-old along with Diana Lasu, 21, and Haja Timbo, 21, are accused of lying to authorities about where they had been on return to Queensland.

'That month of August, sales probably got affected, probably about $100,000 down,' Cowch Bar owner Arif Mendes told A Current Affair. 'It was very, very tough.'

Mr Mendes said he was forced to send five staff to isolate for two weeks after working on the day of Ms Muranga's visit, while another 15 required tests.

'So that was pretty tough for all of them trying to support them during that period - not only financially but with their mental health,' he said.

Mr Mendes said furious patrons hurled abuse at him following Ms Muranga's visit to his bar. 

'We had customers calling, mad at us, saying "hey, why didn't you tell us?" And there were people around us saying "were you there Arif? Don't come near us, don't go your local gym",' he said. 

Both Ms Muranga and Ms Lasu were diagnosed with COVID-19 after allegedly ignoring isolation orders and spending eight days in the public while infected.

Ms Timbo tested negative for coronavirus, while the 22-year-old sister of one of the infected pair turned in a positive test result. 

Authorities believed a man contracted the virus when he ate at a Sunnybank restaurant, also attended by one woman two days after her arrival in Brisbane.

His wife - who worked in a nursing home - later also tested positive.

Genomic testing was done in August to determine whether there was a link between the cluster sparked by the women from Logan, south of Brisbane, and one involving people connected to a Brisbane youth detention centre staff member who also tested positive.

Queensland's chief health officer Jeannette Young said last month the clusters were of the same virus strain although there was a 'missing link' between the two.

Health Minister Steven Miles later said the testing hadn't proved a solid link between the two.

The travelling trio appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday charged with one count of fraud and one of providing false or misleading documents.    

They are facing up to five years in prison and a $13,000 fine if convicted. 

The three women allegedly gave an emergency officer a Queensland border pass that contained false information stating they had not been in a COVID-19 hotspot in the previous 14 days, according to court documents.

They are also charged with fraud for allegedly dishonestly gaining a benefit of avoiding the mandatory 14 day self-quarantine at their own expense.

Lasu and Muranga's matters have been adjourned to October 28.

Timbo's case is listed again for October 21.

The three will not be required to appear in court if represented by their solicitors.
