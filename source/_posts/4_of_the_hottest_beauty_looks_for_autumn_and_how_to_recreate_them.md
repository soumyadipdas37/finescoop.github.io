With autumn officially here, we're sure you're already all over the updating of your new season wardrobe.

But what about your new season beauty?

The AW20 catwalks had some seriously strong beauty looks and considering that we could all do with cheering up as new restrictions are put in place, we thought we should take a look at some of the most fabulous.   

There's serious inspiration to be found so why not give these statement looks a go? Even if the only people who'll see them are those you live with! 

Shine on 

 Embellishment at Giambattista Valli, Halpern and Preen by Thornton Bregazzi AW20

The runways were literally sparkling in February and March this year.

At Giambattista Valli and Halpern, eyes were adorned with jewels, which certainly makes a difference from just a slick of mascara.

And at Preen by Thornton Bregazzi the models' foreheads (not a place we consider adding makeup to normally) had been livened up with a touch of gold leaf.

Shimmer and shine at Simone Rocha AW20

Simone Rocha's models had a similar effect applied to their eyelids but in a zesty orange and charcoal black. LOVE.

L-R: NYX Professional Makeup Face & Body Glitter (was £5.09, now £4.79) and NYX Professional Makeup Glitter Goals Liquid Liner in Quartzy (was £7.99, now £6.39) at Very

Who doesn't want to sparkle?

But we don't expect you all to start gold-leafing your foreheads.

Instead, why not invest in some face and body glitter?

NYX Professional Makeup's Glitter Brillants can be applied to cheeks, eyelids, foreheads and anywhere else you choose.

And the Glitter Goals Liquid Liner will create dramatic swoops of shimmer sure to catch the light.

Wing it 

Major winged liner at Valentino, Christian Dior and Rag & Bone AW20

Ah yes, winged eyeliner.

An absolute classic. Ditch the smokey smudged look and go for a clean, geometric line that really makes a statement.

Valentino had a bit of a 1960s Mary Quant vibe while at Rag & Bone the wings were white and very, very cool.

Extreme liner at Miu Miu AW20

And for a super extreme wing, can we direct you to the beauties on display at Miu Miu.

Stretching all the way to the temples, they're certainly a sleek way to turn heads. 

L-R: Revlon Colorstay Liquid Eye Pen Blackest Black (£6.99) and NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP White Liquid Liner (was £8, now £5.99) at Very

Fancy recreating this fabulously modern-retro beauty look?

Then grab a precise liquid liner like this one by Revlon and start practicing those swoops and clean lines. 

And anyone who loved that white winged liner can get the look too with NYX Professional Makeup's white liquid liner.

Gothic glamour

Gothic glamour at Anna Sui, Rodarte and Gucci AW20

We can't think of a better winter beauty trend than Gothic glamour. 

It doesn't mean you have to paint your face white like the Goths of the 1980s, you can just adapt these runway creations for the real world.

Start with a dark and moody lip as seen at Anna Sui and Rodarte, adding dark and moody eyes to keep things a little brooding.  

And we're loving Gucci's commitment to drama with this running mascara effect too. Now that really is moody.

Gothic glam nails at Valentino AW20

And extend the Gothic glamour to the rest of your look with some black polish on short 1990s inspired nails.

L-R: Illamasqua Antimatter semi matte lipstick ni Spectra (was £19.99, now £14) and Essie Expr Quick Dry Nail Polish in Black (£7.99) at Very

Oh how we love a rich, inky purplish-red lipstick.

And this one by Illamasqua really does the trick, while the Essie Quick Dry Nail Polish in black is perfect for looking ominous this season.

Ominous in a totally fabulous fashion way of course.

Be bold with colour

Flashes of colour at Dries Van Noten and Louis Vuitton AW20

If the Gothic look isn't your vibe then you might be better suited to the bright colour that was also in abundance on the AW20 catwalks.

At Dries Van Noten and Louis Vuitton, hair was sprayed with wash-out neon tint in a truly bold move. We particularly love it used on the parting at Vuitton.  

What a brilliant way to give your look a temporary update in a flash.  

Hot pink eyes at Matty Bovan AW20

And it wasn't just hair that got a dosing of hot pink.

At Matty Bovan's show, the models rocked fuchsia eyeshadow like it was a bandit's mask.

Ace!

L-R: NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Ultimate Shadow Palette (was £17.99, now £15.99) and Beauty Works Double Hair Set Clip-In Extensions in Mauve Metallic (£315) at Very

Brighten up your beauty (and your season) with this fantastically bright eyeshadow palette by NYX Professional Makeup.

And add some short term colour to your hair with some clip-in extensions in this stylish shade of mauve by Beauty Works.
