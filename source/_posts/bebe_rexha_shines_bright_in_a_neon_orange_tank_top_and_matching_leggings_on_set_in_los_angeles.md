While the pair have been linked together since March, Bebe recently went Instagram official with her new boyfriend, Keyan Safyari. 

In 2019, Bebe admitted to Nylon magazine that she's fluid when it comes to picking the perfect romantic partner. 

'I think I scare men. I feel like everyone's scared of me, guys and girls,' she said. 'Because I like to say things, and they're scared I'm going to say something about them. Sometimes I get nervous, and I say stupid things. I'll come off really hard. Guys especially, they can't handle me. I break every guy.'
