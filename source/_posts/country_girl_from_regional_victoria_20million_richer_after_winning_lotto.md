A self-described 'country girl' who has been playing the same Lotto numbers for 20 years will step out of lockdown in Victoria $20million richer.

The woman, from Gippsland in regional Victoria, won the division one prize in Tuesday's draw.  

'My heart is pounding,' she said after finding out she was the winner.

'We've been playing for a long time. I always play the same numbers. I've been playing them for about 20 years I'd say.'

She said the numbers included things such as her birthday but she had chosen some so long ago she had forgotten why. 

The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would remember this moment for the rest of her life.

However, she doesn't plan on retiring any time soon.  

“I don’t know what I’d do with myself if I retired! I’m a country girl through and through!” she laughed. 

“I’ve been working for the past 30 years, and I don’t think I could give it up that easily. I’m at work at the moment. I’ve got things to do! 

She said she planned to buy a new car and share the money with her family.
