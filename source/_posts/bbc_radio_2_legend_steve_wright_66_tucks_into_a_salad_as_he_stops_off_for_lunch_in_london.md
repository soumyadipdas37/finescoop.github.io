He's been a prominent feature on the BBC radio schedule since the 1980s. 

And, Steve Wright, 66, tucked into a salad as he stopped off at a restaurant for an al fresco lunch during an outing in London, on Tuesday.

Low-key: Steve Wright, 66, wrapped up in an all-black ensemble, which he topped off with a brown flat cap, during an outing in London, on Tuesday.

Sat al fresco, the presenter tucked into a fresh salad, which he appeared to wash down with a glass of red. 

At times during his pit stop, Steve decided to cover up with a face mask, and spent much time on his mobile phone.

After enjoying his lunch, the radio host carried large shopping bags as he strolled along the street. 

Walking through the grey streets in a pair of casual black shoes, the Steve Wright In The Afternoon presenter looked to be lost in thought.

The star has previously spoken openly about his weight struggles.

In 2010, speaking to The Daily Mail, Steve revealed that he was on a mission to shed one-and-a-half stone in order to be more comfortable with his body shape; a goal weight of 12 or 13 stone. 

Steve, who has been 18 stone at his peak weight, had at the time already lost the same amount of weight by cutting chips and crisps.

He said at the time: 'I've been eating healthily and I've lost about one-and-a-half stone. But I want to lose another stone-and-a-half at least...

'I'm not there yet but I'm getting there. I've cut out chips, crisps and I no longer eat chocolate.'

He also explained that he had been walking a lot around the West End, sometimes strolling a couple of miles to Regent's Park, but admitted that sitting down for his regular show had lead to his former weight gain.

'When you get to my age,' he added. 'You get that paunch and I also sit down all day for my work. So exercise is the key – but eating right is also important.'  

The star has two children, Tom, 29, and Lucy, 22, from his marriage to ex-wife Cyndi. The pair divorced in 1999. 

The DJ joined the BBC in 1980, previously presenting the Saturday night slot and breakfast shows on Radio 1.
