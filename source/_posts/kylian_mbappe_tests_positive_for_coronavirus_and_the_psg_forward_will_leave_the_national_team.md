Kylian Mbappe has tested positive for coronavirus according to French outlet Telefoot.

The Paris Saint-Germain forward will leave the France national squad and return home.

Didier Deschamps' side now are set to face Croatia on Tuesday night in the Nations League without their star man.

Mbappe is also set to miss PSG's fixtures away to Lens on September 10 and at home to Marseille on September 13.   

The World Cup winner has this week warned PSG that they must spend money on new recruits in order to win the Champions League next season.

The Ligue 1 champions fell short in the Champions League final last month in a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. PSG graduate Kingsley Coman score the only goal of the game, as Mbappe struggled to have much impact.

Whilst Neymar confirming that he will stay in the French capital is a big boost to their Champions League hopes next season, Mbappe believes there is still a need for more additions to their squad.

'Of course I am optimistic that we will win the Champions League. We have to because, if we don't believe it, no one is going to believe it for us,' Mbappe told Telefoot. 

'It's football and you have to get over it. Lots of teams lost a final and won the year after. Obviously, PSG grew up with this final. Before, we had this block of the quarter-finals, now we broke that.

'You have to recruit well, you have to buy players. I hope we will have good recruits and that we can restart the season with the aim of doing better.'
