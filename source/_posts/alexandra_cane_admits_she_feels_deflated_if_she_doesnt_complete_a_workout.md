Before heading to the gym, Alexandra revealed her reasoning for hauling herself to the gym despite not really feeling up to it.

She said: 'If I don't workout & leave it til later, so many things could happen during the day which drain me/leave me less motivated to go tonight.

'I need to get it done for my own mental strength and wellbeing. I wanna be able to relax this evening.'

Her story: In an open and honest Instagram post, the Love Island star recalled the changes she's made in her life both physically and mentally and how it's helped her for the better

'To look back at where I was then and where I am now, it’s almost like I’m looking at two different people. Not even just physically, but mentally I know how far I've come. 

'I had the worst anxiety, falling asleep thinking about death every night, zero purpose, zero motivation, in denial about my relationship with alcohol, food & most importantly, myself.

'My life has been turned absolutely upside down - and for the better.'
