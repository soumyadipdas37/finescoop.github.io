Off line: Only 135,000 smart meters were installed between April and June

Lockdown has heaped misery on the Government’s smart-meter rollout, as installations crept up by 0.4 per cent in three months.

Only 135,000 smart meters were installed between April and June, down from 980,000 in the first three months of the year, according to Government figures.

The drop was expected, as suppliers focused on emergency metering work due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus. 

Ministers had aimed to install the gadgets in all homes and small businesses by 2020, they then pushed the target back to 2024 due to technical issues. 

It was then extended to 2025 after lockdown put work on hold.

Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs at Smart Energy GB, says: ‘We expect installation numbers to rebound as restrictions are eased.’
