Chrissy Teigen has opened up about a scary racist incident that happened over a decade ago in Virginia with her husband John Legend.

The 34-year-old supermodel, whose mother is of Thai descent and whose father is Norwegian, spoke about the incident in a wide-ranging profile with Marie Claire. 

Teigen was with her husband John Legend in Fredericksburg, Virginia, as they were driving at night looking for Legend's godmother's house, when they were followed by two 'neighborhood-watch-type' men. 

Opening up: Chrissy Teigen has opened up about a scary racist incident that happened over a decade ago in Virginia with her husband John Legend.

Telling all: The 34-year-old supermodel, whose mother is of Thai descent and whose father is Norwegian, spoke about the incident in a wide-ranging profile with Marie Claire 

'We were in a nicer neighborhood at night, driving slowly, looking for John’s godmother’s home,' Teigen began.

'These two guys were in a pickup truck slowly tailing us, flashing their lights and trying to speak to us. When we pulled over, they were like, "What are you guys looking for?" and we gave them the address,' she added. 

The two men responded, "Get your asses out of here!" with Teigen stating they, 'proceeded to follow us all the way into her driveway.'

Nicer neighborhood: 'We were in a nicer neighborhood at night, driving slowly, looking for John’s godmother’s home,' Teigen began

Once they got to the home, Teigen added, 'they got out of the car and stared at us as we knocked on the door and went inside. It was a terrible, scary experience.'

Teigen explained through tears that incident was her 'first taste of seeing what happens to Black men every day.' 

'It was horrifying and could have gone wrong so quickly. I was sobbing afterward for hours, and I noticed John wasn’t emotional about it,' Teigen admitted.

Stared: Once they got to the home, Teigen added, 'they got out of the car and stared at us as we knocked on the door and went inside. It was a terrible, scary experience'

'Seeing that he wasn’t very thrown by it was really upsetting because he obviously had experienced it before,' she added.

While the incident happened in 2010, when Teigen and Legend were still dating, she believes it still would have happened today, which she blames on the current administration.

'People are very confident in their ways of being open about their racism because they have the backing views of the president,' Teigen added.

Experienced: 'Seeing that he wasn’t very thrown by it was really upsetting because he obviously had experienced it before,' she added

'It's become such a hurtful, weird presidency for so many Americans, and I’m going to fight to get this person out of office because I can’t live another four years with this kind of hatred boiling through America,' she added.

Teigen is expecting her third child with John Legend, who she dated for four years before he popped the question in 2011 before they tied the knot in Italy in 2013.

The happy couple share two kids, four-year-old daughter Luna and two-year-old son Myles.
