It has been fourteen years since she relocated from Australia to the bright lights of Los Angeles to further her acting career.

And on Tuesday, Tammin Sursok's thick American accent was hard to ignore as she appeared on Channel Seven's The Morning Show in Sydney via a live link from her home in the United States. 

The Pretty Little Liars star, 36 - who was born in South Africa before relocating Down Under at age four - sported a thick Stateside twang as she spoke candidly about homeschooling her children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sounding different: South African born Australian actress Tammin Sursok's thick American accent was hard to ignore as she appeared on Channel Seven's The Morning Show in Sydney via a live link from her home in the United States

The former Sydneysider spoke about dropping her eldest daughter Phoenix, 6, back to school with her teachers, while admitting that homeschooling curing the pandemic had been tough.

'I don't know what's happening in Australia, but I would say most of the schools are shut down [in America], so it's really up to us to figure out how to teach our kids.

'The difference is when your kids are at school, they're much more willing to listen to their teachers.

'But when it's their parents, they really don't want to do that when they're in their space at home. They know [home] is for playing, having fun, eating and swimming.'

Tammin shares daughter Phoenix and one-year-old daughter Lennox with filmmaker husband, Sean McEwen.

The former Home and Away's star accent has regularly been criticised over the years, and just last year the star was forced to defend herself.

In response to a follower who pointed out how 'goes in and out' of different accents, Tammin offered an explanation for her distinctive speech.

Tammin, who was born in South Africa, lived in Sydney for 15 years before relocating permanently to Los Angeles well over a decade ago.

She explained that her changing accent is simply down to having lived in various parts of the world for significant periods of time.

'I lived in Australia for 15 years and have lived in the USA for 14 years,' she wrote on Instagram. 'Now you can stop asking about it. Also I was born in South Africa!'

Born in Johannesburg, Tammin and her family immigrated to Sydney when she was just four years old.

In 2000, Tammin landed her first acting gig, playing Dani Sutherland in Australian soap Home and Away.

She stayed in the role until 2004, and was even nominated for a Most Popular New Female Talent Logie in 2001.

By 2006, Tammin had relocated to Los Angeles and is now best known for her roles in U.S. dramas The Young and the Restless, Hannah Montana and Pretty Little Liars.
