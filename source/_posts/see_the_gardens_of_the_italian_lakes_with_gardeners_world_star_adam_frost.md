With their spectacular backdrop of the Alps and a mild climate all year round, it’s no wonder Lake Maggiore and Lake Como have provided the inspiration for many authors, poets and painters over the years.

The charming islands dotted across the lakes are the home to delightful Renaissance villas with stunning gardens that flourish in the Mediterranean climate – and you’ll get to explore some of them on this wonderful eight-day tour.

Joining you to give his expert insight into the gardens will be the popular Gardeners’ World presenter Adam Frost.

He will join you for a boat trip to the islands of Isola Bella and Isola dei Pescatori on Lake Maggiore, founded in the 10th Century, and you’ll take a walk with him through one of its formal Italian gardens.

He will also join you for an exclusive talk and Q&A session about his life, award-winning garden design career, and TV presenting.

You’ll stay in the stylish town of Stresa, located on the edge of Lake Maggiore, which stretches from Italy into Switzerland. The lake features in Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell To Arms and was one of the American writer’s most-loved places to visit.

Italy’s best-kept secret: One of the country’s lesser known lakes, the charming Lake Orta, will be one of the highlights of your trip. The pebble-studded lanes and alleys –lined with food shops selling famous Italian produce – lead to the lake shore and romantic main square.

Magical rail journeys: Named after the so-called ‘hundred valleys’ it passes through, the Centovalli Railway features panoramic carriages so you can soak up the scenery as you journey through mountainside villages, wild woods and romantic landscapes.
