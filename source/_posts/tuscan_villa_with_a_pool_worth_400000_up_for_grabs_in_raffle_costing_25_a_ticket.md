A stunning villa in the heart of Northern Tuscany can be won in a raffle - with tickets costing just £25 each.

The traditional property, valued at £400,000, boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a swimming pool and substantial landscaped gardens.

Raffled by Jon and Annmarie Nurse from Dorset, the property is in a rural, unspoilt and tranquil area north of Lucca in the northern part of Tuscany, and is the ideal location for those wishing to get away from it all.

In addition to the fully furnished villa, all of the winner's transfer taxes and legal fees will be covered, and two paid-for flights to Italy from anywhere in Europe will be thrown in so contracts can be signed, with two nights in a hotel and car hire also included.

Only 20,000 tickets are available, meaning purchasers have a higher chance of winning than in other property raffles where ticket prices are as low as £1 with a high number required to be sold. 

In addition, £50,000 will be donated to The Children's Society, a national charity supporting vulnerable children in England and Wales.

The villa is located in Garfagnana - a peaceful location in the midst of the countryside, with plenty of pretty hilltop villages to visit, as well as National Parks, boasting rolling hills and mountains.  

The coast - Forte dei Marmi and the Cinque Terre - can be easily reached by car or train while the ski resort of Abetone takes around one hour 20 minutes by car.

There is a beautiful vaulted ceiling made from local chestnut wood, as well as an original arched feature windows.

The Tuscan retreat is completely furnished and will be ready for the lucky winner to move into if they want to live in it. 

Owner Jon said: 'This could be a truly life-changing opportunity to have your very own Tuscan retreat with a beautiful private pool – and it's yours to do what you want with it.

'You can live it in and enjoy it - imagine sitting in a nearby piazza sipping an Aperol and sampling the amazing food you get in the traditional restaurants. 

'Alternatively, you could rent this home out as a holiday home, or even sell it to give you a great nest egg.

'The funds generated from this sale will be put to good use – we know there's a shortage of good accommodation in the UK so we want to get involved and improve situations for people that need it.
