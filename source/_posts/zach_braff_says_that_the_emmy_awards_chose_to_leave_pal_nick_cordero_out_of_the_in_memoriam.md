Zach Braff just revealed the Emmys 'chose to leave' his close friend, late star Nick Cordero, out of their in memoriam segment.

The Scrubs star, 45, took to Twitter on Monday to express his frustration at the awards, writing: 'For those wondering: The Emmys chose to leave Nick Cordero out of the memorial montage.'

He continued: 'I had no idea one had to campaign to get their loved one in. We did. They passed.'

Frustrating: Zach Braff expressed his disappointment that close friend Nick Cordero was left out of the In Memoriam segment of this year's Emmys in a series of tweets on Monday. The buddies are seen in April 2019 above

Zach followed up by sharing a statement he said was from the Emmys.

'They did want me to pass along this note,' it read. 

'Those involved in the In Memoriam selection process are very aware of the sad passing of Mr. Cordero due to the coronavirus and we assure her that his name has been given every consideration for inclusion.

'With so many people passing in any given year, we simply cannot ensure that any one particular individual is included, nor do we release the names of those included prior to the telecast.'

Not happy: The Scrubs star, 45, took to Twitter on Monday to share his frustration at the awards

Their statement: Zach shared a statement her said was straight from the Emmys

Another absence: Zach also expressed his disappointment at Scrubs co-star Sam Lloyd not making the cut, even after his lifelong work as a television actor

While some commenters tried to point out that Nick was better known for his Broadway accomplishments than TV, the Garden State writer/director noted Cordero's credits on Blue Bloods. 

Zach was also disappointed by Scrubs co-star Sam Lloyd not making the cut, even after Lloyd's lifelong work as a television actor. 

'I should mention too, that they also left out Sam Lloyd,' Braff wrote. 'I would have never even considered "campaigning" for Sam because he had more TV credits than most actors I know.'

 Lloyd's IMDB credits him with 69 acting roles, most of which were from small screen appearances.

Off the list: Kobe Bryant, Kelly Preston and three-time nominee Kenny Rodgers were also left out of the tribute, which was set to a performance of Nothing Compares 2 U sung by H.E.R.

Cordero wasn't the only big name who was skipped during Sunday night's tribute, which was set to a performance of Nothing Compares 2 U sung by H.E.R.

NBA legend Kobe Bryant, actress Kelly Preston, and three-time nominee Kenny Rodgers were also left out. 

Cordero passed away on July 5 from COVID-19 complications after fighting for his life at a Los Angeles hospital for 94 days.
