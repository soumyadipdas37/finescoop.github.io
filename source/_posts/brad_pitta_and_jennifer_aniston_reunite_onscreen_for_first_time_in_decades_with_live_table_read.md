Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunited onscreen for the first time in decades Thursday with a risqué scene during a table read of Fast Times At Ridgemont High.

The 56-year-old actor took on the role of Brad Hamilton, originally played by Judge Reinhold, 63, while his ex-wife Jennifer, 51, played high school 'sex queen' Linda Barrett, portrayed by Phoebe Cates, 57, in the 1982 coming-of-age teenage dramedy.

Pitt and Aniston shared a screen together during the film's daydream sequence that takes place after Brad arrives at a pool party hosted by his younger sister Stacy Hamilton, played by Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts, 52.

Aniston wore a red bikini top over a white tank top for the scene during the live virtual table read and Brad brought a pirate hat for his character's fast-food restaurant employee costume.

'Hi, Brad,' Aniston's character Linda said to him during their first exchange.

'Keep it down, I've got some work to do upstairs,' Brad grumbled back as Stacy explained that he hates his work uniform.

Morgan Freeman, 83, who narrated the event by reading out selected scene headings and action, described how Stacy walked back to the house to get Q-tips after getting water in her ears, while Brad was in the bathroom undressed with 'arms pumping slowly'.
