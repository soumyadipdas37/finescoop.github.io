Gary Ablett Jnr's wife Jordan has uploaded a beautiful picture of their son months after revealing he was battling a rare degenerative disease.

Mrs Ablett took to Instagram on Wednesday afternoon to post a shot of Levi with a big smile on his face playing around on a bed.

'"I love each and every facet of you, my precious diamond." - Nanna,' she captioned the post, in honour of her mother Trudy who sadly passed away from her long term battle with cancer in August.

The family revealed Levi is fighting a rare disorder in July after Ablett played his 350th AFL match for the Geelong Cats.

The couple both took to social media to share the 19-month-old's diagnosis.

'We thank you for your love and support and want to emphasise just how grateful we are to be Levi's parents,' Ablett wrote.

'He is a true blessing to us and our family and we love him so deeply. Anyone who knows him knows how full of joy he is and how he always has a smile on his face.'

Ablett's post was followed with an open letter to Levi uploaded on Jordan's Instagram account.

'To our dearest Levi, words will never be enough to express just how full our hearts are of love for you,' the post reads.

'You've only been with us for a short while but you've already taught us more than some people learn in a lifetime.

'Although it has been a difficult journey and start to life, your diagnosis does not take away any ounce of our love for you.

Your joy is contagious and not even this disease is able to steal it from you. We pray for you every day and we will continue to take each day as it comes.

'You are so loved by all of the people in your world and you are and will continue to be a true miracle.

'We have no doubt that we are your parents for a reason, and we feel a strong sense of privilege to be entrusted with such a great and precious responsibility.

'We don't know what our future holds together but we do know that you'll never have to feel alone.'

Ablett posted an update of his brave son in August, showing the youngster being fitted with a medical boot.

'We got some special boots fitted for our brave boy yesterday,' the 36-year-old wrote alongside the photo.

'He’s a happy and determined boy who is showing our family there is so much to be grateful for.'

The trio had spent two weeks living with other AFL families in the hub at the four-star Mercure resort on the Gold Coast before heading home on Tuesday. 

Ablett is set to retire at the end of the season and will line up for the Cats against Port Adelaide in the first qualifying final on October 1 at the Adelaide Oval.
