A woman has revealed how she banished stubborn black mould from her outdoor patio roof in just minutes using a combination of two supermarket products. 

The woman, from Perth, said she mixed vinegar and dishwashing liquid with warm water before she used a broom stick to get rid of the fungus on the surface.

'No one else cares about how satisfying this is so I thought you all would appreciate it, scrubbed my patio roof today because the mould was getting to me,' she wrote in a Facebook group.

'I used vinegar and dishwashing liquid in warm water then scrubbed it with a broom.'

She shared a 'before' and 'after' transformation pictures showing the sparkling results, saying: 'It looks so much better after.'

The woman responded to the thread, saying she's aware a pressure washer could give her the same result - but she doesn't own one.

'Yes, I am aware a pressure washer does the same thing and would be my first choice to use that if I did have one but no I don't have one,' she said.

Her post was met with hundreds of comments, with dozens of people saying they now feel inspired to go remove mould from areas in their homes.

'I've been putting mine off for the last three months... might get onto it over the weekend,' one woman said.

Many described her transformation as 'great', and 'brilliant', while others said it was 'therapeutic' to remove the stubborn stains from their homes.

Others shared their own cleaning tricks and results, with many describing it as 'therapeutic' 

Others shared their own cleaning tricks and results, with one woman suggesting she used Glitz outdoor cleaner, which is sold at Bunnings for $9.49 for a two-litre bottle.

'Spray on and hose off, so much easier,' she said.

'My whole house has corrugated veranda around the back and it now looks like new again after 21 years of build up.'

Another woman said she used sugar soap wipes to clean the stubborn stains first before using a combination of water and detergent. 

'Mine was covered in fat and dirt from previous owner who had a barbecue under cover. I used sugar soap wipes first on worse parts, then broom with hot water and detergent... Finished with high pressure hose,' she explained.
