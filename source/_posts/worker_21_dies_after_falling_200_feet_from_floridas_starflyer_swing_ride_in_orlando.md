A Florida amusement park worker has died after falling 200 feet from the Orlando StarFlyer attraction, dubbed the world's tallest swing ride.

The 21-year-old employee was performing a safety check about halfway up the 450-foot-tall ride when he plummeted to his death just before 8am on Monday, the Orange County Sheriff's Office stated.

The worker struck a platform below the ride at ICON Park on International Drive in Orlando and went into cardiac arrest, according to first responders who were called to the scene.

At the time of the fall, the worker was ab out halfway up the 450-foot-high ride, billed at the world's tallest swing ride 

The man was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries, according to MyNews 13.

As of early afternoon, the name of the deceased has not been made public pending the notification of next of kin.  

The swing ride opened to the public in 2018. According to the description on the attraction's official site, StarFlyer has no age limit and no weight limit, and the minimum height required to go on the ride is just 44 inches. 

The ride is made up of 24 double seats that travel up and down and around the giant tower for 3-4 minutes.

'No other attraction combines safety and thrills like the Starflyer,' the website boasts.

John Stine, director of sales and marketing for StarFlyer, told Fox 35 that the attraction undergoes daily safety and maintenance inspections, which was the case this morning.

'It's a shock and we're saddened by it, anytime there is an injury or something of this nature. It's extremely sad. But we're holding up and supporting each other,' Stine said. 

The ride will remain closed while the local sheriff's office and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigate the fatal fall.
