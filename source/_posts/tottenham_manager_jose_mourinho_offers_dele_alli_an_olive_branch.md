Jose Mourinho has extended an olive branch to Dele Alli by hinting he may be involved in Thursday night's Europa League play-off.

Alli was left out of the Tottenham squads for the recent matches against Southampton and Newcastle United in the Premier League, then Tuesday night's Carabao Cup game with Chelsea.

The England midfielder has been linked with a move away from the north London club before the summer transfer window closes on Monday night.

But Mourinho has suggested Alli could be involved in Thursday's fixture against Israeli side Maccabi Haifa.

He said: 'I cannot confirm Dele's playing tomorrow but I cannot confirm he's not playing. We have still training sessions today, we have still decisions to make.

'The only thing I can say is he's being very, very professional. I have only respect for him. He's being very professional, particularly yesterday when the team was preparing for the game and he wasn't.

'It would be perfectly acceptable to have a lack of motivation, even a lack of professionalism for this training session, but it was exactly the opposite.Â 

Alli played in the Europa League against Shkendija last week and could be involved again

'He trained very hard yesterday. He has my respect and the respect of his team-mates so it's possible he plays tomorrow.'

Mourinho is certain to rotate his squad as they prepare to take the field again just 48 hours after their penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea.

Alli, 24, started Tottenham's opening league fixture of the season against Everton but was withdrawn for Moussa Sissoko at half-time.

He also started last Thursday's Europa League qualifier against Shkendija in North Macedonia, completing an hour of the 3-1 win.

Alli has been linked with a season-long loan move to Paris Saint-Germain but the two clubs would have to trash out a deal quickly with just five days of the window left.
