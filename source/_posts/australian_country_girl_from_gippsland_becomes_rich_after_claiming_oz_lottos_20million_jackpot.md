A self-described 'country girl' will be celebrating her $20million lotto win with a meal at the local pub.

The woman from Drouin in Gippsland, Victoria, became a multimillionaire overnight after scoring a winning ticket in Oz Lotto's Tuesday night draw.

But the humble Australian said she has no plans to stop working despite her new wealth.

'I don't know what I'd do with myself if I retired! I'm a country girl through and through!' she laughed.

'I've been working for the past 30 years, and I don't think I could give it up that easily. I'm at work at the moment. I've got things to do!'

She said she plans to share the money with her family, as well as splashing out on a few luxury items including a new car. 

She also revealed she was eager to celebrate once Victoria's regional restrictions lifted later tonight. 

'I'm looking forward to a meal at the pub to celebrate,' she said.

The Gippsland winner held the only division one winning entry nationally in Oz Lotto draw 1387, drawn Tuesday 19 September 2020, and takes home a division one prize of $20 million.

As well as winning the coveted division one prize, her entry also scored division three 7 times, bolstering her total prize to $20,027,765.85.

She revealed her shock at receiving the life-changing news after playing the same numbers for the past 20 years.  

'I marked the numbers with my birthday and things like that. I chose them so long ago now I don't know why I chose them,' she said.

'I play every week, and lately, I haven't had much luck. I'm always joking with the guy in the store that I never win anything.

'I guess I never won any smaller prizes because a big one was on its way! '

When asked how it felt to become an overnight multi-millionaire, the thrilled winner revealed it was just one of several life-changing moments she'd experienced.

'A few years ago a family member had a serious accident so I am very much aware of how your life can change in the blink of an eye,' she declared.

'This is another one of those life-changing moments but definitely a more exciting one. You really don't know what each day will bring.'
