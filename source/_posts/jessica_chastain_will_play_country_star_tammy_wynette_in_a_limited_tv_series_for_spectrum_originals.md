Jessica Chastain will be playing Tammy Wynette in a new limited series for Spectrum Originals and Paramount Network.

The series, titled George & Tammy, will tell the story of Stand By Your Man songstress Wynette's marriage to fellow country great George Jones.

As of now, an actor has not been cast in the role of Texas-born crooner George.

George & Tammy is being based off the book The Three Of Us: Growing Up With Tammy And George written by the couple's daughter Georgette Jones. 

It will follow the couple's tumultuous six year marriage, which inspired some of country music's greatest songs about heartbreak, including duets We're Gonna Hold On, Golden Ring and Near You. They were wed from 1969 to 1975.

Tammy's song Stand By Your Man is one of the best selling country singles by a female artist, cementing her title as the First Lady Of Country Music. Wynette passed away in 1998, with 20 number one songs to her name.

George & Tammy will be available exclusively for Spectrum subscribers for nine months before finding its way to ViacomCBS' forthcoming streaming service and Paramount Network.

Executive producers include series writer Abe Sylvia, Andrew Lazar, Josh Brolin, and Chastain herself.

David Glasser, David Hutkin and Bob Yari are executive producers from 101 Studios along with writer and executive producer Bryan Goluboff.

Katherine Pope, head of Spectrum Originals, said: 'I first read Abe's feature script a few years ago and couldn't get it out of my head — the examination of human frailty and redemption was so unexpected, given the glitz and glamour of the subject matter.'

'We all thought we knew who Tammy Wynette was, but there is so much more to her that we never saw. Jessica brings her incredible depth of intelligence, empathy and strength to peel back all the layers of this country superstar.

'It's an honor to work with this dream team — all the producers and our partners at 101 Studios and Paramount Network — we can't wait to bring this incredible series to our viewers.'

Before Jessica plays the D-I-V-O-R-C-E singer, she'll be seen as another legendary Tammy on the big screen.

Chastain stars as televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, set for release next year.
