The name's Loudon. Ella Loudon… 

The 27-year-old model and actress, whose father is James Bond star Daniel Craig, poses on a motorbike before roaring off into the wilderness, teasing her Instagram followers with the caption: 'Prior to the mud and putting on a helmet…'

Ella has obviously inherited her dad's sense of adventure.

Daniel Craig rode a similar off-road motorcycle during a high-octane action sequence as 007 in Skyfall

It's great to see former Pirelli model Christina Estrada back on the social scene, enjoying dinner with friends at swanky Mayfair restaurant Scott's.

My exclusive picture shows her smiling alongside Walid Abu-Zalaf, the publisher of Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds.

The 57-year-old supermodel was sporting an enormous sparkler on her ring finger, although she denies there is any romance between the two of them.

Christina made headlines in 2016 when she was awarded an astonishing £75 million in her divorce battle from the late Saudi billionaire Walid Juffali.

She had originally sought £196 million from Juffali when they separated after 13 years together, which she had claimed was required to meet her 'reasonable' needs.

She lives outside London with her daughter Sirina from her marriage to Juffali. The tycoon died from cancer shortly after the divorce hearing.
