 Ashlee Simpson and Christina Aguilera didn't let the COVID-19 restrictions stop their Halloween fun on Wednesday night.

The celebs and their families joined a host of stars at the friends and family opening of Nights of the Jack at King Gillette Ranch in Calabasas.

The annual event has been adapated for 2020 into a drive-thru Halloween experience, allowing guests to social distance and still enjoy all the spooky fun of the thousands of hand-carved and illuminated Jack O’ Lanterns.
