Showing off her natural beauty, Lady Amelia - who goes by Mel - opted for a lowkey make-up look, sporting light foundation and a gentle lashing of highlighter.

Ever stylish, the heiress sported a pair of brown Chelsea boots and finished her look off with a catwalk-ready deep red lip.

Meanwhile, pal Esther sported a matching pink mini skirt, with chunky sandals and oversized cream jacket.

Her appearance comes weeks after she joined her sister Lady Marina, 26, for a sun-soaked Scottish staycation amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
