Kelly Slater has been spotted catching waves in Bali on a near empty beach after managing to get round the island's strict travel restrictions.

The US born world champion is staying in Bali, enjoying stunning views and incredible waves.  

The 48-year-old shared phenomenal videos and pictures of him and fellow pro surfer Betet Merta catching massive waves at Padang-Padang Beach in Uluwatu.

The pair shared incredible footage of themselves riding massive waves on a near empty beach in Bali

At one point the pair were double-barrelling in a wave, almost colliding into each other, as a cameraman captured the amazing footage. 

'Double barrel with the king at Padang Padang @kellyslater,' Merta captioned the video.

According to Beach Grit, other people were also enjoying the popular holiday spot despite COVID-19 restrictions.

The publication claims that there is a way to get around the travel ban, a hack that was revealed in a simple WhatsApp message. 

The message claims that all tourists have to do is pay $1,700 for a 60 day Indonesian visa and book at least 10 days in Kandui Resort on the Mentawai Islands in Bali. 

The individual would also have to return a negative COVID-19 test to ensure the safety of workers and others. 

However travellers might struggle to find a flight heading to Bali during the worldwide pandemic. 

Despite having low cases of COVID-19, Bali is yet to reopen fully to international arrivals and decided against it due to several travel restrictions from other countries. 

Australians are unable to leave the country unless they have an exemption from the government. 

Bali's governor said there are still some 'red zone categories' in Indonesia which makes it a bit difficult to reopen the island as well. 

The country is also not accepting visas from international tourists until they can ensure all resorts, hotels, cafes, restaurants have a COVID-19 safety plan in place.
