Bayern Munich's return of supporters has been blocked mere hours before their season opener after authorities revoked the move following a spike in coronavirus infections in Germany. 

The Champions League winners host Schalke tonight as they look to defend their Bundesliga title once more at the Allianz Arena, after Hans Dieter-Flick's side romped home to victory last season.

There had been plans for 7,500 fans to attend the game this evening, as football attempts to bring supporters back to games amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Bayern Munich will not host 7,500 fans during tonight's season opener against Schalke

However, following a recent surge in cases in the country, authorities have opted against allowing the fans into the ground tonight, according to Bild. 

At the time of writing, Germany has 2,194 covid-19 cases, which is a big jump from the 927 cases confirmed on September 14.

That represents an overnight spike of 34 cases per 100,000 to 47.6 in the Bavarian capital.  

It was announced on Wednesday that the 7,500 fans would be allowed to attend the game, but by Thursday, authorities grew concerned that the move may have been made too soon.

The remainder of the 2019-20 campaign was played behind closed doors with the Bundesliga one of the first leagues to return amid the pandemic.
