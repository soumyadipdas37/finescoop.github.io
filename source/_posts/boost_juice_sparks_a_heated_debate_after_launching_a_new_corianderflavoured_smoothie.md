Australian juice chain Boost Juice has sparked a heated debate on social media after launching a new coriander and pineapple flavoured smoothie. 

The juice brand teased its customers - including those who are part of the 'I hate coriander crowd' - on Facebook after asking fans whether or not they like coriander. 

'Hate coriander? You can suck it,' the chain joked on Monday. And in a cheeky move, the brand also revealed it had purchased the 'I love coriander' domain name.

More than 1,400 people responded to the amusing thread, with hundreds of people expressing their 'hatred' over one of the world's most controversial and divisive herbs.

'Coriander makes my blood boil, there's nothing I hate more than coriander. It literally tastes like soap with the texture of grass and is vile and revolting,' one said.

Another woman wrote: 'If I could burn all the coriander on this planet, I would. Lost me on this one. Pretty sure it came from the pits of hell.'

Many insisted 'coriander is grown in the devil's garden' while some joked 'it's the real devil's lettuce'.

Dozens of people suggested the herb tastes like dishwashing soap or even vomit.

'I believe I'm justified in my hate of coriander, I'm one of the people who can taste soap too. I can't even walk past fresh coriander without wanting to gag,' one said.

Another woman wrote: 'Coriander tastes like vomit to me. I've tried so hard to love it, but really, I just can't no matter how I try. Just keeps on tasting like vomit.'

The debate comes as the juice brand unveils its smoothie range, including new flavours such as 'pineapple coriander twist' and 'pineapple lychee crush'

Scientists previously found up to one in seven people can experience the taste and smell of coriander completely differently, describing it as being like soap.

They found a set of genes related to smell and taste are responsible for this effect.

'It's literally genetics that determines if you can taste the soapy taste in coriander or not, so you can't really help not liking it when you can taste a gross taste others can't,' one woman explained.

Another said: 'Cool fact! Some people (like me!) have a genetic variation which makes coriander taste like soap. For that reason, I personally avoid it like the plague.' 

And one man added: 'I wish I knew what coriander tastes like to most people. Unfortunately I'm one of those people for whom it tastes like soap.' 

Many fans defended the divisive herb, with one woman saying: 'Coriander is the single greatest plant on the planet. 

'If the Prime Minister was coriander I bet we'd have flying cars, world peace and the Aussie dollar would be on par with British pounds... Curries, chutneys and ice cream. Is there anything that glorious herb can't do? I don't think so,' she said.

A second fan wrote: 'Finally the battle between good and evil is upon us! You hates are going down.'

And another added: 'Coriander is my single favourite thing. All salads should have coriander instead of lettuce.' 

One fan suggested: 'For all the coriander lovers, you might want to try making cilantro ice-cream. Seriously amazing. Google it and put your lock down time to good use.'

Meanwhile, one woman asked: 'I don't think I've ever had coriander. Is this another thing I'm missing out on in life?!'

The debate comes as the juice brand unveils its smoothie range, including new flavours such as 'pineapple coriander twist' and 'pineapple lychee crush'.

Many said they couldn't pluck up the courage to try the new coriander-flavoured smoothie.

'This is my worst nightmare. Imagine drinking a coriander smoothie,' one woman said, while another added: 'I mean if the world was ending and the only thing left to drink was a coriander smoothie... guess I'd be going thirsty.'

Some who already tried the latest creation said: 'Just tried it. Delish.'
