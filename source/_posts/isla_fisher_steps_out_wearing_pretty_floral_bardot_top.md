Australian actress Isla Fisher looked lovely when she stepped out in LA on Sunday. 

The 44-year-old wore a nude Bardot top which had a rose print running throughout, which she teamed with denim hotpants. 

She teamed her look with a pair of bright coloured pumps as she headed across the road, wearing her flame-red locks in an elegant up-do.

Isla added some further glamour to her look with a pair of gold drop earrings and a simple necklace.

She also made sure to adhere to safety rules by donning a mask as she stepped out, amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Isla found fame starring on Home And Away before landing roles in several Hollywood blockbusters, including Confessions of a Shopaholic and The Great Gatsby.

She currently has three films in post-production, Blithe Spirit, Godmothered and Unplugging - but fans will no doubt be keen to see if she's landed a role in the surprise Borat sequel.   

Isla has been married to comedian and filmmaker Sacha Baron Cohen, 48, since 2010 and back in 2016 they collaborated on his action comedy, Grimsby. 

Sacha's most famous film, Borat is now set to get a sequel - which has already been filmed and screened for 'a select few industry types,' according to a new report from Collider.

Cohen, 48, had previously revealed in 2007 that he was planning to retire both his Borat and Ali G characters, though it seems he had a change of heart. 

The sequel reportedly follows Cohen's Borat, who, after the release of the 2006 Borat film, thinks he's a huge movie star.

He tries hiding from the public, interviewing people while taking on different alter-egos along the way.

One source described the meta sequel as, 'Cohen playing Borat playing Cohen.'
