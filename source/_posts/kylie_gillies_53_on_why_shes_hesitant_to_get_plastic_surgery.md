She's known for her youthful and primped persona as co-host of Seven's The Morning Show.

And Kylie Gillies revealed to The Daily Telegraph's Confidential on Sunday why she's hesitant to get plastic surgery.

In favour of a 'try before you buy' approach, the 53-year-old said she's frightened of what the result may be.

When asked whether she would ever consider going under the knife, Kylie responded: 'Oh boy. Never say never... but I would be really frightened of how surgery would turn out. 

'I don't even like getting items custom made such as dresses because I like to try before I buy. I feel this would be the same for my face. What happens if you hate the result?'  

She went on to reveal how she's debated fixing her short-sightedness with laser eye surgery, but is too nervous, joking: 'You're stuck looking at this mug. Sorry.' 

End result: When asked whether she would ever consider going under the knife, The Morning Show co-host responded: 'Oh boy. Never say never... but I would be really frightened of how surgery would turn out' 

Kylie spoke about ageing in an interview with WHO magazine in September last year.

'Here's the thing, I don't walk around stressing over whether I'm about to get another wrinkle,' she said.

'I'm at a stage in my life where I feel quite comfortable in my own skin. For every extra line or crow's foot... guess what? It comes with a bonus offer... of extra knowledge, empathy, wisdom.'

The journalist added that while she's grateful to have a hair and makeup team for her weekday job at Channel Seven, the 'real' Kylie emerges on the weekend.

'That's the Kylie that you'll see running up and down the sidelines taking photos of her kids' AFL game and it's the mum you're going to see in the aisles at Woolies doing her groceries,' she said.  

Kylie lives in Sydney with husband Tony Gillies. They share two teenage sons, Gus and Archie.
