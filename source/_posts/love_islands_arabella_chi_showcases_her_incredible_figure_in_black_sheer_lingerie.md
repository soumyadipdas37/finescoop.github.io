She was soaking up the sun with her new man 'playboy' Morad Izemrane in Ibiza earlier this month.

And Arabella Chi set pulses racing as she shared a series of sizzling lingerie snaps on Instagram.

The former Love Island star, 29, looked incredible as she showcased her jaw-dropping figure in a black sheer set.

Arabella, who is back in the UK after spending the past few weeks in Ibiza, showed off her sun-kissed tan in the stunning snaps.

The model fixed the camera with a sultry stare while she styled her blonde tresses into loose waves.  

Alongside the post, Arabella wrote: 'Lil bit naughty lil bit nice'.  

Her sultry post comes after it was revealed last week that her new man is 'playboy' Morad Izemrane, who was arrested for allegedly stealing a Rolex from a woman he had a tryst with.

Arabella was first spotted packing on the PDA with Izemrane, 35, in Ibiza toward the end of August, just weeks after going public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.

And, as well as unveiling Izemrane's identity, The Sun has also reported that he was arrested for stealing a pricey timepiece from a woman he had a tryst with in a toilet.

According to the publication, he was arrested on accusations of 'affectionate theft' against the Italian woman when attempting to fly from Ibiza to Palma the next day.

The case against Izemrane - who previously dated Dutch model Estelle Cruyff, 41, who is the ex-wife of former Chelsea ace Ruud Gullit and niece of late soccer legend Johann Cruyff - remains as yet unresolved.

According to The Sun, the way Arabella and Izemrane met is just as astonishing, with a source saying: 'She was seeing a rich guy called Mark and they were out at a party when his friend Mojo turned up with a bottle of champagne.

'Later that evening she took off with Mojo in his Ferrari, leaving her boyfriend Mark behind. That's how they met. It was pretty shocking. They've been together ever since. Arabella likes a good time and hasn't looked back.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Arabella Chi for comment.

Her new romance may come as a surprise to fans, as things appeared to be hotting up with Josh just a few weeks ago.

Blonde beauty Arabella moved in with fellow Love Island alum Harley Brash, 21, in June following her split from Wes Nelson, 22.

The pair had been dating for nine months but were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their break-up.

Arabella appeared on the 2019 series of the ITV2 show and struck up a brief romance with Danny Williams, but was dumped from the island after just seven days.
