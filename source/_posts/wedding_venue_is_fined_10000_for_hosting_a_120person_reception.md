An events venue has been fined £10,000 after police found 120 revellers at a wedding party. 

Police were called to the venue at 4.45pm on Friday following reports of a wedding reception taking place at Stafford Park in Telford, Shropshire. 

The scenes came nearly a week after the Prime Minister set out a raft of measures designed to clampdown on the coronavirus, including slashing the number allowed to gather at nuptials to 15.    

Chief Supt Paul Moxley, of West Mercia Police, said: 'The majority of our communities are adhering to the new COVID legislation and laws and are acting very responsibly.

'It is therefore unacceptable that a minority of people are continuing to disregard the rules and as a consequence a £10,000 fine was given to the organisation hosting the wedding party in Telford today.

'It is believed that around 120 people were attending the event in Stafford Park, all of whom left the venue when we attended and spoke to them.

'Therefore no fixed penalty notices were given to the guests.

'We are taking a robust enforcement approach towards those who choose to intentionally break the law and in order to help suppress the virus and protect everyone, where people are clearly breaching the regulations they will be given a fine.'

Last Thursday police shut down Adelina's Bar and Kitchen in Swansea after dozens of guests were found crammed inside the venue for a wedding reception. 

A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: 'South Wales Police responded to a report of a gathering at the Adelina's Bar and Kitchen at approximately 7.10pm on Thursday.

'Upon arrival officers found large number of people in attendance at a private function.

'The function was shut down and all attendees ordered to leave.

'Further enforcement action by South Wales Police and Swansea Council is currently being considered.'    

A spokesperson for Adelina's Bar and Kitchen told The Sun they had only taken a booking for 25 people for the wedding reception .

They claimed to be unaware of bookings taken in other parts of the restaurant for the same party. 

In August, police also shut down a wedding reception at Waheed's Buffet and Banqueting Hall in Blackburn after more than 100 people gathered to celebrate a local lockdown-breaching wedding reception.
