Tottenham are primed to host Wales's ‘home’ match against England this autumn if fans are allowed to watch the emergency Autumn Nations Cup tournament.

On Thursday, the Six Nations unions finally confirmed they would run an eight-team tournament with Georgia and Fiji joining as guests. 

It is understood all 16 games will go ahead whether or not fans can attend due to the need to fulfil broadcast and sponsorship deals.

Spurs exploring the option of putting on November 28 clash between England and Wales

And while Twickenham will host three Tests — England v Georgia on November 14, against Ireland on November 21 and a ‘finals weekend’ match on December 6 — Wales’s home venue is still up in the air.

But sources have indicated to Sportsmail that Spurs are keen to stage the Wales v England clash and are exploring the option of putting on the November 28 clash. Tottenham play Chelsea away in the Premier League that day.

While talks between the Welsh Rugby Union and Tottenham are ongoing, it is unlikely a deal will be rubber-stamped quickly — as it depends whether the Government will grant permission for spectators to attend.

Wales have ruled out using the Principality Stadium, as it is still acting as a hospital, but will play at a regional ground if fans are banned.

Wales and England will feature in an eight-team tournament featuring Georgia and Fiji

If reduced capacities are allowed in England, the WRU could send Wayne Pivac’s Wales to multiple London football grounds for ‘home’ Tests against Scotland, in the Six Nations, England and Georgia as well as the ‘finals weekend’ game.

However, after the Government limited fan test events to 1,000 supporters, plans are uncertain.

As Sportsmail revealed in July, England and Wales are grouped in the Autumn Nations Cup with Ireland. Georgia also join Pool A after Japan pulled out. 

In Pool B are France, Scotland, Italy and Fiji.  Teams will play three pool matches then a placing game against the equivalent finisher in the other group, hosted at Pool A grounds. 

Georgia and Fiji will be based in Europe for the duration, and Sportsmail understands that, while England are considering a cricket-style biosecure bubble at The Lensbury in Teddington, Wales are to base themselves at their usual Glamorgan hotel and travel to games via multiple buses to comply with social distancing.
