We've seen her hiking, boxing and doing push-ups in the park during her 'year of health'.

But on Thursday, Australian actress Rebel Wilson was mixing her workout routine up by taking in an energetic game of tennis.

The 40-year-old, who is currently in LA, shared a post game image to her Instagram Stories.

'What a great afternoon of tennis with my bootch,' she captioned the post, which featured her Isn't It Romantic co-star Brandon Scott Jone.

The Pitch Perfect star then flaunted her newly slimmed-down physique by posing against a tree and in a blue Gucci sweater adorned with two tennis racquets.

'I'm always thinking,' she captioned the glamorous image of herself staring off into the distance.

In the picture, Rebel wore her luscious blonde locks in loose waves which cascaded over her shoulders and glam makeup with a full coverage foundation, smokey eyes and soft pink lip. 

After months of rigorous exercise and dieting, Rebel finally revealed her magic weight loss number last week.

The Australian actress revealed she is currently 83kg (13 stone, or 183lbs).

Green with envy! The Australian actress revealed she is currently 83kg and only a few kilos off her goal weight of 75kg 

'The blonde uploaded photos of herself flaunting her slimmed-down figure in a blue wrap dress, explaining in the caption that she's not far off her goal weight of 75kg (11.8 stone, or 165lbs).

'Thanks for all the love so far on my 'Year of Health' journey,' she wrote in the caption of her post. 

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead. 

She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'

Rebel has lost an estimated 18kg since the start of the year, after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

Before and after: Rebel has been on an incredible weight loss journey this year. (Pictured left in 2013 and right in 2020) 

'So for me 2020 is going to be called 'The Year of Health',' she wrote on Instagram at the time.

'So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she declared.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'
