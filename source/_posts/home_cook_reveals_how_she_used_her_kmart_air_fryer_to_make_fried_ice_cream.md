Posting to an Australian cookery group, mum Stephii was inspired by her parents who used to make the dessert when they owned a Chinese restaurant.

'Success! I made friend ice cream in the air fryer! It has a crunchy outside, followed by a soft sponge and an ice cream centre,' she posted on Facebook.

Stephii made the dessert by following a simple YouTube video and used four ingredients - eggs, ice cream, desiccated coconut and sponge cake.

The video begins by shaping the ice cream into a seven-centimetre ball using an ice cream scoop.

The sponge cake is then wrapped around the ice cream ensuring it is fully closed.

The ball is rolled in the egg wash followed by the coconut before being placed on a lined tray to be placed in the freezer for four hours. 

After four hours have passed, the air fryer was preheated for ten minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.

The ice cream balls were then sprayed with a small amount of oil and placed into the air fryer for four minutes.

Stephii added a chocolate topping with mint and sliced strawberries on the side.
