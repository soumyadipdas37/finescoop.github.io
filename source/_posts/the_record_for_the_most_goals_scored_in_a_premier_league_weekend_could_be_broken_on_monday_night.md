The record for the most number of goals in a single Premier League gameweek could be broken on Monday night, with just five goals needed to eclipse the all-time total in the modern era.

A whopping 39 goals were scored during Saturday and Sunday's action, which is just four behind the record for the most in a top-flight gameweek in a 20-team season - set in February, 2011.

Aston Villa host Sheffield United while Manchester City travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers in Monday night's Premier League action to round off the epic weekend.

Five goals are needed on Monday to break the top-flight record for most goals in a gameweek

39 goals have gone in so far this weekend, including seven in the Southampton vs Spurs game

Gameweek two of the 2020-21 Premier League season started in superb fashion as Everton thumped West Bromwich Albion 5-2, before Leeds triumphed 4-3 over Fulham. 

Saturday's action also saw Crystal Palace stun Manchester United 3-1 at Old Trafford, before Arsenal edged West Ham 2-1 in north London.

In total, Saturday's action saw 21 goals go in, which is record for a single day of Premier League football with a maximum of four games played.

On Sunday, Tottenham continued the spree with a 5-2 thrashing of Southampton at St Mary's, with four goals coming from South Korean forward Son Heung-Min.

Everton began the weekend in stunning fashion as they beat West Brom 5-2 on Saturday

Brighton picked up their first win of the season later in the day with a comfortable 3-0 victory at Newcastle, while Premier League champions Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-0 at Stamford Bridge. 

The weekend's top-flight goalscoring tally could have been even greater had Chelsea's Jorginho netted a late penalty, but Alisson saved his spot kick in west London.

The fourth match of Sunday saw a six-goal thriller as Leicester City beat Burnley 4-2 at the King Power Stadium. 

Leeds' 4-3 win over Fulham helped Saturday's action reach 21 goals - a record for a single day

The all-time record for most goals in a 20-team season weekend has stood for nearly a decade since Premier League clubs went crazy in early February, 2011.

The most eye-catching result was Newcastle's 4-4 draw with Arsenal at St James' Park, made even more special by the fact that the Magpies were 4-0 down to Arsene Wenger's side at half-time.

Everton also beat Blackpool 5-3 at Goodison Park, while Wigan edged Blackburn Rovers 4-3 in a thriller in Greater Manchester. 

That weekend is second-highest in the list of all-time Premier League weekend results as 53 goals were scored on the final day of the 1992-93 season. 

The record was set in February 2011, the same weekend as Newcastle's 4-4 draw with Arsenal 

However, 22 teams competed in a 42-game season back then with the top-flight reduced to just 20 sides in 1995. 

This weekend is on course to break the record for the most average goals-per-game across a single gameweek in Premier League history with a minimum of five games played.

So far, 4.88 goals have been averaged across the weekend's action, which is more than the 4.82 from May 1993.

Saturday: 

Everton 5-2 West Bromwich Albion

Leeds 4-3 Fulham 

Manchester United 1-3 Crystal Palace

Arsenal 2-1 West Ham

Sunday: 

Southampton 2-5 Tottenham Hotspur

Newcastle United 0-3 Brighton

Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool

Leicester City 4-2 Burnley

Monday:

Aston Villa vs Sheffield United (6pm)
