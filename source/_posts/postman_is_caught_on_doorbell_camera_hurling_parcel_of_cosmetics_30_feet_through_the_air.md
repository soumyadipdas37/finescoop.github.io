A postman has been caught on a doorbell camera hurling a parcel of cosmetics 30 feet through the air because he couldn't be bothered to ring the bell.

Homeowner Damien Cooke got a Ring.com notification on his mobile that someone was approaching his house in Margate, Kent, on Thursday morning.

The estate agent, 49, said the postman didn't ring the bell and instead threw the package - which contained cosmetics for Mr Cooke's wife - towards the door.   

He compared the worker to former Brit Olympic shot putt star Geoff Capes and added: 'It was the best throw I've ever seen. It must have gone about 30ft.'

Mr Cooke was a bit frustrated the postman didn't ring so he could have let him through the gate at the end of the garden path.

He said Amazon and other delivery workers have done that or just carefully placed it over the gate. 

Mr Cooke, owner of Cooke and Co Estate Agents, added: 'It had a few dents in it, but luckily nothing was broken.

'The slightly frustrating thing for me is it gives me a notification when someone is there.

'But he didn't even ring the intercom. He just threw it. He could have just placed it over the fence. I did email Royal Mail but I do not hold up much hope.

'I just want them to do that next time. And I don't want anyone to lose their jobs, particularly in this climate.'

He said although he found it funny, his wife was annoyed because it was her parcel. Luckily none of the products were damaged by the impact.

He posted the video on Facebook and said: 'Had a home delivery today from Royal Mail. Did not pay for Airmail but the delivery driver included it for free. Thanks not.'

Rob Brady said: 'He'll blame Covid mate, social distancing.'

Christopher Watkins quipped: 'Sign him up for the England cricket team.'

Kerry Head said: 'That's just pure b****y laziness.'

Royal Mail has been approached for comment.
