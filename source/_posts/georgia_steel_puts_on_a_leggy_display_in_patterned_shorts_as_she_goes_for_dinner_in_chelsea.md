Speaking on FUBAR Radio, she revealed she's in no rush to jump into a new relationship.

She explained: 'I'm a good believer in everything happens for a reason and I'm just rolling with it.' 

The former couple's whirlwind romance began in August 2019 when they met during the filming of Ex on the Beach: Peak Of Love, with the pair becoming engaged just a month later.

When asked if she's had many guys sliding into her DMs, Georgia said: 'I just want some time now to just focus on myself and I'm not really wanting to rush into anything. I'm just wanting to take every day as it comes!'
