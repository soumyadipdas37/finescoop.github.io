CNBC's Jim Cramer called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 'crazy Nancy,' to her face Tuesday morning, utilizing the nickname President Donald Trump has given her. 

'Sorry, that was the president,' Cramer immediately said after the slip. 'I have such reverence for the office, I would never use that term.'  

Pelosi laughed and said, 'but you just did, but you just did,' and then called Trump the 'master of projection.'

Pelosi said that Trump (left) gave her the 'crazy Nancy' nickname because he's the 'master of projection.' 'He calls other people crazy because he knows he is,' she said. Trump is photographed Tuesday with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) 

'Let me just say this, anything the president says is a proejction of his own insecurities. He calls other people crazy because he knows he is,' she said. 

'So anytime he says something you say, "Uh-oh, that's what he's thinking of himself,' she continued. 

Cramer tried to walk back his comments several times throughout the interview.  

'You know, I was being facetious when I used the term involving you,' he said. 'I respect you. Anyone who gives their life to public service and is speaker of the House should not be called that name.'

'I don't even want to use it again,' he continued.  

Pelosi waved it off, saying she had 'great respect' for the 'Mad Money' host. 

'Don't worry about that, she offered. 'Let that be your biggest problem today.' 

The speaker also said she saw no point in calling up Trump in order to get another coronavirus relief bill deal. 

'What is the point?' she asked Cramer. 'The president has sent his representatives and if he has confidence in them, than I do too.' 

She called out Trump for his deceptions and proclivity for lying.  

'So if you're talking to him you're almost wasting your time,' she said. 

Pelosi also pointed out that it had been under a year since she'd talked with Trump, having spoken to him last October and interacted with him at the early February State of the Union.
