She's been billed as one of the favourites to win Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart.

But Bella Varelis has well and truly proved she doesn't get the final rose during next week's finale.

The brunette beauty was spotted frolicking on Bondi Beach with fellow bachelorette Bec Cvilikas this week, after the pair moved in together. 

More pictures that spoil the end of The Bachelor: Bella Varelis was spotted on Bondi Beach with fellow bachelorette Bec Cvilikas last weekend 

The 25-year-old stood out on the sand in a high-cut hot pink bikini that accentuated her tan. 

It also revealed a very racy tattoo on her groin - a small heart design.  

Meanwhile, Bec flaunted her curves in a white retro-style floral bikini.

The two women were seen gossiping away during the beach outing, no doubt chatting about their time on the Channel 10 show. 

Later, Bella was greeted by her mother and stepfather who met up with the girls during their sun baking session. 

The brunette greeted her stepdad with a hug, and the group later went to local sushi restaurant Raw Bar.

Their day out all but proves neither win Locky's heart. 

 Bachelor finalists are encouraged to keep a low profile while their season airs, but Bella and Bec chose to top up their tans at yet another paparazzi hotspot.

And they made no effort to hide their friendship, chatting and laughing away as they put their towels on the sand.

Fans are convinced that Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler.

Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale.

However, it's important to note that some former Bachelor winners have remained friends with their co-stars.

Meanwhile, after arriving into The Bachelor mansion as Locky's 'angel', Bella has quickly turned into the villain of the show. 

Fans turned on the brunette on Wednesday night after she accused her former best friend Irena Srbinovska of 'lying'.

The marketing consultant told the other women, Irena, 31, has 'manipulated her way through the show'.

Bachelor fans flocked to Twitter to slam the brunette's behaviour and labelled her a 'hypocrite'. 

'If anyone's manipulating Locky now it's you Bella,' one person wrote.

'Bella has made one mistake that gets people sent home... b**chin about another person in the house!! Bye bye Bella, you used to be my favourite,' another said. 

Summer is almost here! The duo were taking advantage of the warm spring sunshine 

Another wrote: 'Has Bella never seen The Bachelor because this always happens and never ends well?'   

'Bella embarrassing herself more as the episodes go on,' one person commented.

'Oh Bella, right or wrong about Irena, it's absolutely not worth it,' another person tweeted.

'What did you expect Bella? It's The Bachelor... You are all there for the same reason,' another said.

Give away! Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale

During Wednesday's episode, Bella accused Irena of 'manipulating her way through the show'.

'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.

'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10

Beep beep: After the beach outing, Bella drove away in her cream Mini Cooper, with Bec in the passenger seat
