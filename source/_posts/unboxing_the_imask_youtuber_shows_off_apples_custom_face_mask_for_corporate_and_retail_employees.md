Apple has provided its staff with custom masks designed by engineers involved with developing the iPhone and iPad, which the firm says ‘is a superior mask for daily wear.’

The white face covering comes in a range of sizes and can be washed up to five times, along with being worn for eight hours before needing to be cleaned.

Unlike surgical masks, Apple’s version has an adapter to hold it on the back of the head or wearers can hook straps behind their ears.

There is a center piece, another that reaches under the chin and a third extends over the nose where the pinch point is - and a YouTuber said the design 'feels more sealed off than a standard surgical mask.'

YouTuber Jack unboxed the Apple made mask for a video on his channel ‘Unbox Therapy.’

He held up a white box that includes Apple’s must-have tagline, ‘Designed by Apple in California,’ along with ‘Assembled in China.’

‘We have what looks like a serial number, definitely an item number, a lot number, and production date,’ Jack said in the video.

‘So, just like everything else Apple, tremendously detailed stuff over here and an unboxing experience unlike anything you would expect for a reuseable face mask.’

The box includes five masks that are shipped to employees both in corporate and retail – the face coverings are not available to the general public

Jack pulled the mask out from the box and instantly noticed the difference between it and a surgical mask.

‘It looks cool that’s for sure,’ he said.

The face covering comes flat, leaving wearers to unfold the piece that goes on the chin and over the nose.

‘That’s a different fit than what you get out of a typical surgical mask,’ Jack said.

‘It feels very secure. As far as breathing is concerned, I’d say it is fairly comparable to [a surgical mask].’

‘I definitely feel more sealed off than a standard surgical mask.’

Apple has revealed the capabilities of the filter it uses, but Jack says it is ‘a pretty substantial filter.’

News about the tech giant producing its own masks surfaced earlier this month and told staff it was developed by the engineering and industrial design teams that are tasked with working on the iPhone and iPad.

According to Bloomberg, Apple conducted extensive research and testing for this project to find the best materials to filter the air properly.

Along with masks for its employees, the firm is developing face shields for medical workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.

In April, CEO Tim Cook announced the company had sourced 20 million surgical masks from around the world to help address a global shortage.

The plastic face shields can be assembled in under two minutes, Cook said, and ship 100 per box.
