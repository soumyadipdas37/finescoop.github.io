Wolves are set to sign Liverpool defender Ki-Jana Hoever for a fee of around £10million, Sportsmail understands.

The 18-year-old Dutch youth international has appeared four times for Jurgen Klopp’s senior side in the cups.

He became Liverpool’s youngest-ever player in the FA Cup when making his debut at 16 against Wolves last year.

Hoever - who joined the Reds from Ajax in 2018 - signed a new long-term contract last summer and it was thought he could head out on loan this season.

However, he is now set to join Wolves on a permanent deal after terms were agreed between the clubs.

Wolves sold right wing-back Matt Doherty to Spurs this summer and Hoever is seen as an option on the right and in the centre of the defence.
