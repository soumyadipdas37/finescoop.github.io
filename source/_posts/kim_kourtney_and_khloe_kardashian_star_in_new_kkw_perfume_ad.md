They're undisputed masters of illusion when it comes to their appearance on social media. 

Kim Kardashian unveiled a stunning new photoshoot on Tuesday, featuring herself and sisters Kourtney and Khloe to promote their new fragrance Diamonds II Collection from KKW Fragrances. 

However, it was Khloe, 36, who appeared to be stealing the limelight in the latest shots, as she once again showed off her ever-changing visage, while displaying her toned physique in a revealing blue satin gown.

The trio all posed in outfits reflecting the colors of the perfume bottles, with Kim, 39, in green and Kourtney, 41, in Burgundy. 

Khloe showed off her new bob hairstyle that accentuated her facial features, which do appear different from how she has been seen in the early days of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

The mother of True Thompson has certainly caused controversy when it comes to posting selfies on her Instagram account.

One for all: Each sister posed with a bottle of the new perfume from KKW Fragrances

She has been accused by fans of using altering apps such as FaceTune in some posts, as Khloe has been seen in similar clothes while looking completely different in scenes from KUWTK.

However, she has previously laughed off any criticism, and even joked earlier this year that she had undergone a 'face transplant' in an apparent bid to troll fans.  

Meanwhile Kim explained to fans about the fragrance saying: 'We collectively wanted the diamonds to be a bit more rich, sultry and sensual.'

'Each of the jewel tone colors ruby, emerald & sapphire are unique to each sister and have a symbolic meaning that we really gravitated to and found inspiring.'

'I've always loved the deep green color of an emerald stone and how it symbolizes love, prosperity and healing.'

'My scent itself is musky and rich but still has those sweet white floral notes that I naturally always go to. I can’t wait for you guys to smell how amazing these new scents are!'
