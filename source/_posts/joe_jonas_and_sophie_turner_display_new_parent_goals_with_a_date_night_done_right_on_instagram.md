They welcomed their first little bundle of joy in July, but have kept her under wraps. 

And new parents Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner remained coy on Friday, when Joe, 31, uploaded a fun clip to his Instagram Story showing 'date night done right' with his Game Of Thrones star wife, 24.

The brief snippet revealed the couple's preferences when it came to dinner and entertainment: A plate of salad next to a glass of red wine was seen before the camera panned to two screens showing sporting events.

On a laptop screen, the US Open women’s semi-final was playing, while the wall-mounted television screen displayed the first game of the NFL season between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans.

The table was set nicely, and a glass of ice water and even a bread basket were seen near the computer.

The caption over the clip read, 'Date night done right'.

The relaxed vibe gave Joe's 13m followers definite new parent goals, as the pair welcomed baby daughter Willa just two months ago, in July.

And while they have yet to introduce their daughter to the world, they were seen enjoying a sunny stroll last week, for the first time since becoming parents.

Joe and Sophie have also continued to share love for each other on social media, even if they're currently leaving their new little one out of the posts.

For Joe's 31st birthday on August 15th, Sophie shared a lovely black-and-white photo of the pair, with the caption 'Happy birthday to my love/bub/baby daddy'.

Turner and Jonas confirmed the news of their new arrival in a July statement that said they were 'delighted to announce the birth of their baby.'

'The couple is already obsessed and can't stop gloating about their new addition,' a source told Entertainment Tonight that month.

'With the pandemic, Joe and Sophie have been very cautious about who is around them and their little girl.'

Since news of the baby was shared, dedicated Game Of Thrones fans pointed out that the name Willa has a connection to the hit fantasy show.

Two minor characters appeared on the HBO ratings juggernaut bearing the name, including one who appeared in two episodes of season five as a wildling.

A different character called Willow was seen during season eight, gracing the screen as a servant in Winterfell.
