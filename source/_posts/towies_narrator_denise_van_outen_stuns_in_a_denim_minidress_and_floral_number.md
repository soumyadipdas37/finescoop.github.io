The wrap-over dress was embellished with a green daisy print and featured a material belt which highlighted Denise's slender figure.

Denise had made a quick change as she arrived to filming in her denim puffball minidress, silver sandals and a crocodile print handbag.

Essex girl Denise has strong associations with the show, narrating the reel at the beginning of each episode which states 'some scenes are created for your entertainment'.  

While the Masked Singer star filmed in her hometown, a group of the cast headed to Oxford to watch James 'Diags' Bennewith sky-dive. 

Amber Turner, 27, and Dan Edgar, 30, put on a loved-up display as they watched Diags, 29, take to the skies in a plane before doing his death-defying stunt.

Filming comes after TOWIE veteran Amy Childs criticised Mark Wright for snubbing the 10-year reunion and tells how the cast should remember 'where we have come from'.

The TV star, 30, explained how without the hit ITV show Mark, 33, and the rest of the TOWIE line-up 'would not be where they are now'. 

Amy, who joined as part of the original first series in 2010 aged 20, said that the cast 'owe' their success to TOWIE and told how 'the least we can do is celebrate that'. 

Speaking to The Sun, Amy, who starred as a qualified beauty therapist on the show, said: 'Mark is a friend of mine but I think we have to remember where we have come from.

'The show has achieved so much. It has given us all amazing opportunities and lives.' 

She added: 'It is a shame Mark has chosen not to celebrate and be a part of that. It is the least we can do.'  

The mother-of-two described how 'everyone loved Mark', who is married to actress Michelle Keegan, 33, and said she was 'shocked' he did not return given his status as the 'King of Essex'. 

Amy described how returning to the reality show 'feels like home'. 

It comes after Mark took part in annual charity game Soccer Aid as he played with the England team against the Rest of the World at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday.
