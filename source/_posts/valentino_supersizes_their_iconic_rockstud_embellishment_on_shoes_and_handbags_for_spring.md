While Americans were hunkered down at home amid the coronavirus lockdown, a report by RetailMeNot showed a 39% increase in consumer demand for shoes.

Studded accessories in the form of handbags, jewelry, flat sandals and high heeled footwear came down the catwalk, teamed with everything from billowy floral dresses to tailored shorts.
