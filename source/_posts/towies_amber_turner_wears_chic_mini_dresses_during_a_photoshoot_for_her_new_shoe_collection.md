She's used to turning heads with her impeccable style choices on TOWIE.

And away from the ITVBe show, Amber Turner continued to wow in the fashion stakes as she put on a leggy display while modelling footwear from her Envy Shoes collaboration. 

The 27-year-old looked incredible in a chic tan ensemble before slipping into a black midi dress during a photoshoot in Ealing, London on Thursday.

Amber appeared to be having a great time during the shoot as she flashed a dazzling smile before pulling off her best poses.  

In her personal life, Amber has been in an on-off relationship with her co-star Dan Edgar since she joined TOWIE  two years ago. 

But Amber and Dan have been stronger than ever after spending lockdown together.

The couple rekindled their romance in May last year after a brief split which saw the Lothario pursue a relationship with his co-star Chloe Sims, 37.

The blonde beauty previously talked about how Dan has become a 'changed man' since they gave their romance another go. 

Amber told The Sun: 'Sometimes you have to go through really low points in life, and Dan admits what happened was a real low for him. He lost me. I was gone and he wasn't in the best place.

'When you lose someone it makes you realise how much you want them and need them in your life, he's not someone in their mid-20s anymore, he's mature and serious about life.

'Obviously joking around, but he has had his mid-life crisis already. Now he's such a changed person. He's so happy and focused on his future. I'm excited for the future with him.'
