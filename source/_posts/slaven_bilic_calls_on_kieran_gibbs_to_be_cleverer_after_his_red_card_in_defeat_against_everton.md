West Brom manager Slaven Bilic claimed his defender Kieran Gibbs should have been cleverer in avoiding a red card following a clash with James Rodriguez at Goodison.

Gibbs was sent off shortly before half-time for retaliating after he had been pushed by Rodriguez — shoving the Colombian star in the face.

Bilic was also sent to the stands for confronting referee Mike Dean as they walked off for the interval and Albion, trailing 2-1 at the time, eventually lost the match 5-2.

West Brom manager Slaven Bilic (R) called on his player to be 'cleverer' after retaliating

‘Kieran made a mistake when James clipped him. He stayed on his feet and reacted. If he’d gone down, it would have been a yellow card for James and definitely not a red for him,’ argued Bilic afterwards.

‘He did the worst situation by not going down and then reaching with the hand. He didn’t give the referee any other option. He should have been a little bit more crafty and clever.

‘James was waiting and if you do that, it is a straight red. You can’t complain.’

Ironically, Bilic did complain at the time, loudly, to Dean when managers are not allowed to speak to officials until half-an-hour after the final whistle.

A straight red card is the automatic punishment though Bilic insists he was not abusive. ‘As a manager, I should be in a position to ask the referee what is going on. It was half-time, not like the game was going on, nobody was around,’ he said.

‘I didn’t swear. I asked him in a frustrated way but I didn’t cross the line,’ he said. ‘I told him if you want to kill us, kill us. That’s all.’

Bilic was also picked up by TV microphones shouting at Dean ‘Check the foul, check the foul’ — a reference to Everton’s first goal when West Brom believe their defender Darnell Furlong was fouled in the build-up.

Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti wants improvement from his team despite their impressive start to the season. ‘We weren’t able to control West Brom’s transitions in the first half,’ he said.

‘We were more in control in the second half but I have to be honest and say we had a great advantage with their red card. I think we had a lot of creativity in attack with the full-backs pushing up.’
