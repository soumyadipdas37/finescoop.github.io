Chrissy Teigen and John Legend celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Monday, with the couple getting a very special... and tasty gift from Kelly Clarkson.

Teigen, 34, took to Twitter on Monday, sharing a video of the massive pizza her and husband John Legend, 40, got from Big Mama's & Papa's Pizzeria in Los Angeles.

'Oh. My. God. @KellyClarkson I’m screaming your name like steve carell I’m dying!!' Teigen said, referring to Carell's infamous line in 2005's The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

The brief video Teigen shared showed her opening the massive pizza box, which Teigen actually thought would be fake.

'Oh my God. I for some reason thought it would be fake, but it is not fake,' Teigen said while laughing. 

She then showed her husband John Legend taking one piece as Teigen took one for herself, stating, 'Honestly this is the coolest thing ever.'

She then spoke seemingly directly to Clarkson herself, stating, 'I love you. Thank you so much,' as the video came to an end.

Clarkson also shared the video on her own Twitter account, stating, 'Happy Anniversary. I sent wine as well so it was a high/low kind of gift.'

Big Mama's and Papa's Pizza made a name for themselves in March 2014, when the Hollywood pizza place was picked by host Ellen DeGeneres to feed the hungry A-listers during the Oscars telecast.

The pizza Teigen and Legend were sent by Clarkson was their 54 inch by 54 inch Sicilian pizza, according to the Big Mama's and Big Papa's website. 

The enormous pie has 200 squares, feeding approximately 50 to 70 people, starting at $299.99.

Teigen and Legend recently listed their massive $24 million home in Beverly Hills, which got the attention of Selling Sunset star Jason Oppenheim.

Teigen wondered on Twitter if Oppenheim was a 'real' agent because her agents haven't heard of him, but he proved his worth by actually showing her home.

There is no word yet if the house has sold quite yet.
