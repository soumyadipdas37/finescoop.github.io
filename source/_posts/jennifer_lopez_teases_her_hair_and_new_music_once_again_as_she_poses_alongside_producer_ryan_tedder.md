Jennifer Lopez fired up her fans when she took to social media to tease new music on Saturday. 

The superstar entertainer, 51, took to Instagram and shared a couple of selfie photos showing herself, with 1980s-era teased hair, posing next to in-demand songwriter and producer Ryan Tedder.

'Can u feeeeeel it... new music just around the corner!! @ryantedder,' she wrote in the caption, which is no less than the third time she has promoted upcoming music since June.

In one of the snaps, JLo flashed a sassy look by puckering up her lips dressed in a black tank top.

Her blonde-brown tresses were teased back in a messy style, a la 1980s Madonna, as some strands of hair fell in front of her eyes.

There's another selfie that looks nearly identical, with the exception that Lopez traded her pucker for a big beaming smile.

Tedder maintained his own pucker in both pictures, along with bulging eyes, while wearing a black sweatsuit jacket and black baseball cap.

The news of new music got an overwhelmingly positive response from a slew of her 130 million Instagram followers, although some appeared to be growing impatient on her delivery of new songs.

'Omg omg omg omg!!! Love it,' one follower wrote, while many others wrote simple but excited comments like, 'Can't Wait For New Music' and 'YASSSS QUEEN.'  

Another fans wrote: 'Okkkkk I am very very readdddy,' as some people took their need for new music a little farther.   

'Jen stop playing with us. It's been forever and I still don't have a Spanish album,' one commenter shared, while another posted, 'You're playing with our emotions.'

In July, JLo teased that she and Maluma were making music together by sharing a couple of photos of the pair in the studio.

Lopez wrote in the caption: '? Pase lo que pase ‘toy pa’ ti ... ? Are you ready? ?? @Maluma ??.'

Several weeks earlier she fired up her social media fan base by posting a snap of her singing in a recording booth and another of her sitting back on a couch, seemingly in the same studio. 

'It’s summertime and we’re cookin’ up something muy caliente,' she captioned the images with emoji of fire and two eighth notes.

Although The Hustlers star has not released a full studio album since A.K.A. in 2014, she has dropped a string of standalone singles in the proceeding years.

The Lopez-Tedder duo had previously worked together on Do It Well, a song produced and co-written by Tedder that appeared on her sixth studio album, Brave (2007). 

He has also written and produced for such other massive stars as Paul McCartney, Adele, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, One Direction, Maroon 5 and Camila Cabello.

Aside from his collaborative work as a producer, Tedder is also the lead vocalist for the pop rock group One Republic.
