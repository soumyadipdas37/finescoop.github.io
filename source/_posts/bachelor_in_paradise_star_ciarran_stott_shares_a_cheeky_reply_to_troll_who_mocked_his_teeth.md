Ciarran Stott has shared a cheeky response to a troll who mocked his teeth online. 

On Sunday, the British-born Bachelor in Paradise star made a TIkTok video addressing the cruel comment. 

The 25-year-old first showed the comment on screen, which read: 'Without the tattoos and badly bleached blonde hair you are still just an ordinary British guy with bad teeth'.

Ciarran then popped up, flashing his very white smile for the camera and propping his lips open with his finger to flaunt his perfectly straight gnashers. 

In a show of defiance, the reality star's smile dropped off his face, and he raised his middle finger at the person who made the comment. 

In addition, the star, who originally hails from Bolton, Manchester, added the caption: 'Pearly whites up in here!'

Last week, ladies man Ciarran set his eyes on new Bachelor intruder, Bec Cvilikas.

The English lad has been checking out the 25-year-old's Instagram page, liking one of the bombshell's bikini pictures from back in February.  

In the photo, Bec flaunted her pert derriere in a g-string leopard print bikini bottoms paired with a white top as she soaked up the sun.   

Ciarran's apparent Instagram stalking was first noted by Instagram account Bachiefunny, who wrote alongside their post: 'Didn't take long'.

That post was liked by Ciarran's Bachelor In Paradise ex Kiki Morris, who also commented 'Mate' with a laughing emoji.   

Ciarran hooked up with several woman during his stint on the Channel 10 dating show. 

A love triangle quickly developed between Ciarran, Cass Mamone and Abbie Chatfield, but he eventually fell for Jessica Brody. 

He later turned his attention to Kiki, and the couple vowed to give their relationship a go outside of the show, but the pair broke up shortly after filming wrapped.
