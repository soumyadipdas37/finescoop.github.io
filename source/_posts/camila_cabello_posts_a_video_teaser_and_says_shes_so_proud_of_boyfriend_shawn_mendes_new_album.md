They are a musical power couple who've collaborated and duetted in the past.

And Camila Cabello had some sweet words of encouragement for her love Shawn Mendes on Wednesday, when she re-shared a snippet of his beautiful video teaser for his new album Wonder.

Cabello, 23, included a touching tribute to her Senorita beau on Instagram, alongside the clip which showed Shawn, 22, lying on his back and playing a piano above.

The news came as a delight to fans, who had speculated that the pair may have broken up, as they haven't been pictured together lately.

'the world could use some magic, beauty, and Wonder always, but especially right now,' the Cuban-American songstress wrote. 

'@shawnmendes what a gorgeous gift to the world. He's crafted this album with every last bit of his soul, his spirit, and his essence with the purest of intentions.  

'My love, I'm so proud of the person you are and I’m so excited for people to see and hear your heart,' Cabello concluded, adding a ❤️emoji. 

He doesn't need to see the keys: The video teaser showed Shawn lying on a mattress underneath a piano, which he played absentmindedly while singing in a falsetto

Camila's share comes after Shawn posted a longer clip to his own Instagram, which informed his fans that his new single Wonder drops Friday.

It will be followed up by an album of the same name, coming out in early December.

Wonder is already the young musician's fourth studio album, coming out two years after 2018's hit record entitled Shawn Mendes.

The video teaser showed the In My Blood crooner lying on a mattress underneath a piano, which he played absentmindedly while singing in a falsetto and staring off into space.

Soon, he got up and went to a window, where he is silhouetted by dreamy light bursts before the camera zooms and transports the viewer to a distant beach as a pair of birds fly overhead.

The video was accompanied by the image of a handwritten note by Shawn, which said in part: 'I know it's been a really scary year for everyone so I'm sending buckets of love to all of you x

'I wrote and album. It's called "Wonder". It really feels like a piece of me has been written down on paper and recorded into song,' Mendes added.

Camila, meanwhile, is currently hard at work on the film set of her Cinderella reboot, opposite Idina Menzel and Billy Porter.

The Havana singer also recently took to her Instagram to celebrate the birthday of her 'prince' in the new film, who is being played by actor Nicholas Galitzine.

Cabello also included a 'spoiler alert' next to the image, which showed her and Nicholas making funny faces at the camera: 'it's quite a different take on the story'.

'Can't wait for u guys to see us be this stupid on the big screen,' Camila also shared.

Galitzine is also set to appear in the upcoming horror sequel The Craft: Legacy.
