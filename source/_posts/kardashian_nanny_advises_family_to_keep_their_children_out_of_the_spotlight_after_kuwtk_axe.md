A former nanny to the Kardashian-Jenner family has urged Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob and Kylie to keep their children out of the spotlight after they announced they're ending Keeping Up With The Kardashians' 14-year run.

Pam Behan lived with the famous clan from 1991 until 1996 after looking after Caitlyn's sons with Linda Thomspon - Brandon and Brody. 

The Minnesota-born carer admitted she wasn't 'surprised' to find out that sports star Caitlyn, 70, heard they were pulling the plug on the series 'on the news' as she claimed her ex-wife Kris, 64, was 'incredibly controlling' and 'ran the show'.

'I’d like to give them advice to say, make it about them right now, while they're young. I know I wouldn’t want my child in the spotlight 24/7, every move', Pam said in a new interview with The Mirror.

The nurse - who is set to write a tell-all book called Malibu Nanny - also alleged matriarch Kris 'was the driving force' behind their stardom as she 'thrives being in the limelight'.

She added: 'Your kids are young once, only once – make it about them. And then there are always crazies out there who could kidnap them. You have to be so careful and protect them at all costs, that’s part of it. They chose to get into this life but their kids were born into it. I guess, and hope, that’s one reason they’re getting out.' 

Poosh founder Kourtney, 41, shares Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five, with ex Scott Disick, while businesswoman Kim, 39, has North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, 16 months, with musician Kanye West.

'Kris was controlling': The Minnesota-born carer admitted she wasn't 'surprised' to find out that sports star Caitlyn, 70, heard they were pulling the plug on the series 'on the news' 

Khloe, 36, welcomed baby daughter True with on-off partner Tristan Thompson two years ago, and her younger brother Rob, 33, has Dream, three, with former stripper Blac Chyna.

Model Kendall, 25, has no children, and make-up mogul Kylie, 23, shares her only child, daughter Stormi, with hip-hop star Travis Scott. 

Former Olympian Caitlyn recently admitted her fellow KUWTK castmates didn't tell her about the decision to cancel the series beforehand. 

Confessing she wasn't shocked by the news, Pam said she finds it 'unfair that she has been pushed aside' and insisted the reality star was the 'last to find out about anything' as Kris was 'incredibly controlling and ran the show… quite literally.'

She also reflected on her time with the family as she claimed Kourtney was 'standoff-ish for a long time', Kim was 'sweet', Khloe was 'open and honest' and Rob was a 'great, self-disciplined kid'.    

This is not the first time Pam has spoken out about the media personalities, as she once said Kris 'pushed her kids into fame' and 'wasn't easy to work with'.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for the Kardashian-Jenner family for further comment.
