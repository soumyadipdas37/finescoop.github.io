Meanwhile Georgina and Ronaldo had been isolating with their family - Cristiano Jr, 10, Ronaldo's twins Eva and Mateo, three, and their daughter Alana, two, after relocating from Portugal to Turin in northern Italy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family isolated together in Madeira, after three of Ronaldo's team-mates - Daniele Rugani, Paulo Dybala and Blaise Matuidi - were among the first Serie A players to test positive novel coronavirus.

They returned to Turin at the start of May and were required to spend 14 days at home in self-isolation as per government rules for international arrivals. 

They have since enjoyed a luxury family getaway on a superyacht where they visited the likes of Portofino and St Tropez.

In January, Georgina sparked speculation that she'd tied the knot with her footballer beau when she referred to him as her 'husband' in a gushing post celebrating her 26th birthday.  

Sharing a snapshot of herself and Ronaldo posing with their children, Georgina wrote: 'Happy 2️⃣6️⃣ for me, very happy. I can't ask life more. Just a lot of health for my family and me and to always enjoy them. 

'Thank you all for your congratulations, flowers and therefore love ✨ And Thank you to my husband for giving me the best of life, our children. I love you.'

In Spanish, 'marido' is often used to describe a common law husband, while 'esposo' is more commonly employed as a description for a legally wed male.

When contacted by MailOnline, representatives for Ronaldo declined to comment.

For his part, Ronaldo shared the same snapshot on his own Instagram account, alongside the caption, in which he shared that he 'love[s] [her] so much'.

The Portuguese sportsman wrote alongside the heartwarming image: 'Congratulations my love! I wish you a very nice day! You are a great woman and an excellent mother for our children. I love you so much honey!'
