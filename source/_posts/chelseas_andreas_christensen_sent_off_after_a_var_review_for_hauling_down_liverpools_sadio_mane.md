Andreas Christensen has been sent off against Liverpool after bringing down Sadio Mane who was through on goal.

Jordan Henderson's long ball caught out the Chelsea defence with Christensen bundling Mane to the ground before he could knock the ball past the on-rushing Kepa Arrizabalaga.

Referee Paul Tierney originally gave the Blues' defender a yellow card but that was upgraded to a red after the official was advised to check the pitch-side monitor by VAR.
