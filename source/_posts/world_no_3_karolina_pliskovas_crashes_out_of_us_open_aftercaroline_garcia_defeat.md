The women's US Open draw was prised open further on Wednesday night when top seed Karolina Pliskova was ousted from what is already a depleted field.

Only three of the top ten were left when she was beaten 6-1 7-6 (7-2) by France's Caroline Garcia, maintaining the Czech's status as the best player not to have won a Major title.

Six of the world's top 10 players were already absent from the behind-closed-doors tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The big-serving Pliskova, world No 3, would surely have fancied her chances of breaking her duck this year on speeded-up courts at Flushing Meadows.    

Pliskova's departure left Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka as the highest ranked contenders left. 

Garcia, who has won seven tour titles said after the match: 'I knew I had to go for it and believe. I stayed calm and got over the line.' 

She will face No 28 seed Jennifer Brady next in the third round following her upset victory over Pliskova.
