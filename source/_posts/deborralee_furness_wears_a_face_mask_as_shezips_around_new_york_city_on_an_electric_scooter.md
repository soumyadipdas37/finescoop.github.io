Deborra-Lee moved to New York with her husband Hugh in 2008, and they currently reside in the trendy West Village. 

In July, Hugh revealed he was homesick for Australia after a lengthy lockdown in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Deborra-Lee and the couple's children had initially been in Melbourne when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March.

But they returned to the U.S. just four days later in order to keep the family together.

Meanwhile, Hugh is said to be contemplating a move back home to Sydney's Bondi Beach, where he owns a $6million property.

'Hugh has privately considered a move back for years, but he never followed through with it because he has such a good life in the States,' a source told New Idea.

He is reportedly missing having the beach at his backdoor and feels attached to the laid-back lifestyle in Australia.
