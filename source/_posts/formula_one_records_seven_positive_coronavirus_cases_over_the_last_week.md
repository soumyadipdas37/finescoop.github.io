Cases of Covid-19 have been increasing in recent weeks in the United Kingdom, where seven of the 10 Formula 1 teams, and other organisations such as the broadcast crew, are based.

The authorities have not released details of individuals who have tested positive for the virus.

F1’s lead presenter, Will Buxton, confirmed via his social media pages on Thursday that he has not travelled to this weekend’s Russian Grand Prix after testing positive.

All F1 personnel undergo tests for Covid-19 every five days.
