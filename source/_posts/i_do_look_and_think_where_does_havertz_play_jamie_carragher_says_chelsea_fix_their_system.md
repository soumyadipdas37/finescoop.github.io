Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Kai Havertz fits into Chelsea's system after another quiet match in front of goal in the German international's early Blues career.

The 21-year-old played 45 minutes of the Blues' 2-0 home defeat to Liverpool on Sunday before being hauled off at half-time as Frank Lampard brought on a defender following Andreas Christensen's red card. 

Havertz, who joined the Blues from Bayer Leverkusen for £89million during the summer, was also unmemorable on his Chelsea debut against Brighton on Monday and Carragher is struggling to see where the young German will play this season.

The ex-Liverpool defender told Sky Sports: 'I do look and think, where does Havertz play? Where does he fit into a 4-3-3? 

'He almost looks like a number ten and we don't see them as much in football now. Where he played today, I don't think that suited Chelsea.' 

Havertz has played on the right wing in both of his Premier League matches as a Chelsea player even though he earned his Premier League move after impressing through the middle in Germany. 

He scored 38 goals in his final 87 matches for Leverkusen and mainly played as either a centre-forward or an attacking midfielder, also known as 'number 10'.

Jamie Redknapp believes that Havertz is more of an attacking midfielder and sees his Chelsea future in that position, though claimed fans need to be patient if they want to see the best of the German international at Stamford Bridge. 

The Sky Sports pundit claimed: 'You've got to give Havertz time. We have to be careful. We're judging a player. You've got (Christian) Pulisic and (Hakim) Ziyech to come in (as well). 

'I think Havertz is a number ten. With the three they played in midfield today, you need a bit more craft. 

'Are we sitting here and questioning Havertz, he's been here two minutes?'

Fellow pundit Ashley Cole, a former Chelsea defender who now works for the west London club in the youth set-up, added that one of Mateo Kovacic or Jorginho will have to be scrapped if Havertz does make the transition to attacking midfield. 

'New players coming in, it's a process. The new players will have time to gel. Kai Havertz trained four or five days.

'If you want to shift Havertz in a number ten position, then somebody's got to go. Perhaps Jorginho or Kovacic.'
