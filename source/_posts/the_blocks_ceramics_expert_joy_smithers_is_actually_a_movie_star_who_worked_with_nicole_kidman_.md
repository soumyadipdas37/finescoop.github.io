The Block contestants attempted to hone their pottery-making skills on Tuesday night's episode.  

But it was a familiar-looking face hovering in the background that really caught viewers' attention - The Block's ceramics expert Joy Smithers, 57. 

Despite being an accomplished pottery designer, Joy is also an accomplished actress with an extremely impressive resume. 

Did you recognise her? The Block's ceramics expert Joy Smithers, 57, (pictured) is actually a former movie star 

One of her most notable roles was in the 1989 Australian mini-series Bangkok Hilton, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving. 

She also played a member of the Vuvani trube in the 2015 blockbuster Mad Max: Fury Road - which starred Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. 

As for Joy's small-screen appearances, the actress famously spent two decades playing Summer Bay resident Bridget Simmons on Home And Away. 

Who could forget? One of her most notable roles was in the 1989 Australian mini-series Bangkok Hilton, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving. Pictured in Bangkok HIlton with Nicole Kidman

In 2013, Joy turned her back on acting and launched her now-famous pottery brand Batch# Ceramics.    

'I love acting but this was a process of sitting down and thinking to myself, what makes me happy?' she told The Sydney Morning Herald of her decision to change career paths. 

'And for me that is ceramics, it is a passion I have held true since my teenage years,' she added. 

'Using my face to sell the brand would be a bastardisation': Despite being a household name, Joy said she refuses to leverage her fame to promote #Batch.

'For me labelling my brand 'Joy Smithers Ceramics' or using my face to sell the brand would be a bastardisation of something that has been so spiritual for me since I was 13,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald.

Following her appearing on The Block, Joy posted to Instagram about how much she enjoyed her clay throwing session with the teams.  

'This is a career highlight for me because I love The Block! It's the best comedy and the best drama,' she began. 

'Working with the teams was very funny as no one had any experience working with clay before – they tried to do Ghost but it was more like a scene from Amityville Horror!' joked Joy, calling the challenge a 'clay catastrophy'.
