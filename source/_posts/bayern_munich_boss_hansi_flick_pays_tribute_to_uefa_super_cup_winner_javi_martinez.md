Bayern Munich boss Hansi Flick has paid tribute to the ever-reliable Javi Martinez after the Spaniard came off the bench to score the winning goal in the UEFA Super Cup final.

With the game in extra time, Flick sent on the 32-year-old to shore up his defence but it was his contribution at the other end of the field that made the crucial difference, heading in Bayern's second goal and ultimately winning them the final. 

It was Martinez's first goal since April 2019 and could well be his last as he looks to bring the curtain down on his trophy-laden eight-year spell with the club, having been linked with an emotional return to Athletic Bilbao this summer.

And while questions remain over Martinez's future, Flick decided to focus on the here and now, praising the versatile veteran for his late contribution at the Puskas Arena.

'Javi scored the goal and won us the game. Sometimes football writes these stories – this is a beautiful one,' head coach Flick told Sky.

'On Wednesday there were reports that he was in Bilbao, yet tonight he scored the winning goal.

The Bayern Munich boss insisted that 'you can always count' on the experience Spaniard

'You can always count on him, whenever he comes on he always gives 100 per cent out there and has the experience and mentality to win games like he did today, that was the key,' Flick added.

'As for his future, it is not the most important thing right now, it is something he has to decide for himself.'

Flick has used Martinez sparingly since taking over as Bayern coach last year but is not the only coach to struggle to find a role for the player, who can operate as a defensive midfielder and a centre back.

He has only started more than half of Bayern's league campaigns on three occasions, while he missed almost all of the 2014-15 season after rupturing knee ligaments.

'I always want to give 100 per cent for Bayern and I showed that today,' Martinez said.

'Even if I only play 10 or 15 minutes, I try to help the team and I did that today with my goal.

'Now I want to celebrate with the team and my team mates. As long as I am in Munich I will give all I have for the team and defend this shirt.'
