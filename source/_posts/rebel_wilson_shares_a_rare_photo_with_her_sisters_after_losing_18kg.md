The Pitch Perfect star, 40, posed with her rarely seen mother and sisters in the snap.

Rebel has two sisters, Liberty and Annaleise (who also uses the name Annarchi), and a brother, who goes by the name Ryot.

The star has declared 2020 her 'year of health', and has losing at least 18kg so far.

Shrinking: Rebel showed off her cleavage and slimmer frame as she met a pooch, in a photo shared to Instagram (pictured) earlier this month

Earlier this month, she drew attention to her shrinking frame while posing a photo shared with her 8.6 million Instagram followers.

She revealed a glimpse of cleavage and her slimmed-down waist in a white top and black pants, as she posed at her home in Los Angeles. 

Rebel added a chic red cardigan and white loafers to the look, and swept her blonde locks into a sleek high ponytail.

Blue beauty! Last month, Rebel showed off her slimmed down physique in a tight blue wrap dress on Instagram (left). Pictured on the right in May 2019  

She was wearing minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine through.

'I made a new friend today x thanks Aunty Hilary,' Rebel captioned the photo, which showed a friend's dog resting its paw on her leg.

Rebel recently returned to Los Angeles, after spending several weeks in her home city of Sydney, Australia. 

Impressive: The Pitch Perfect star embarked on a healthy lifestyle which has seen her lose a staggering 18kg. She only just returned to the US, after spending time in Sydney
