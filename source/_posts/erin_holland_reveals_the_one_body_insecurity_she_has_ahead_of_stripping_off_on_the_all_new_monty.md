She's set to strip off on Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals later this month.  

And now model and singer Erin Holland has revealed that baring all didn't come easy. 

The 31-year-old told The Daily Telegraph that she's felt insecure about her 'flat chest' her whole life, but found doing the show was 'liberating.'

'I'm actually really self-conscious': Erin Holland candidly revealed this week the one body insecurity she has ahead of stripping off on The All New Monty

'I am actually really self-conscious about the fact that I am flat chested,' Erin told the publication. 

She added: 'I couldn't care less about getting up in front of people and performing but showcasing the part of my body that I dislike the most was definitely the hardest part.' 

The former Miss World Australia added that despite being insecure about her chest, she has no plans of getting any cosmetic enhancements.

Erin also revealed to the publication that her fiancé, cricketer Ben Cutting, was slightly shocked that she would be taking part in the burlesque show.  

She said: 'He was like, "But that is for me." But it is for a good cause.' 

The couple were supposed to tie the knot back in June, but were forced to postpone their special day because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Erin's candid admission about her body insecurity comes as she prepares to strip off for Channel Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals.

She will do a burlesque alongside the likes of actress Sam Frost, entertainer Patti Newton, Russell Crowe's ex wife Danielle Spencer and Olympian Leisel Jones.

But in this year's iteration of the charity strip show, the ladies will be joined on stage with male celebrities including actor Samuel Johnson, former Home and Away star Orpheus Pledger and comedian Paul Fenech.   

The All New Monty: Guys and Gals will air Sunday, September 13 at 7pm on Channel Seven
