Flaunting her killer physique, mother-of-four Kim stunned in a grey running top and matching cycling shorts, favouring Lauren's number.

In 2018, the model welcomed comparisons to the businessman from fans, stating in her Now! magazine column: 'It's a massive compliment, of course, when people say we're similar.

'I think she is absolutely amazing but I'm not trying to be her. Yes, we both have big booties and we like a pout and a selfie but that's about it really.'

'It's a compliment': In 2018, the Instagram sensation revealed she's flattered by comparisons to the reality TV icon, 39, as they 'both have big booties and like a pout and a selfie' 

Just last month, the TV personality hit out at social media users who praise Kim for uploading a racy picture while slamming Lauren for her sizzling shots.

The brunette told The Sun: 'Kim posts a topless selfie and she's a feminist. I post a bikini picture and get called an attention seeker. It's double standards. There is no need for it. 

'And calling me a bad role model? I just laugh. I'm Kate Middleton's favourite TOWIE star, so I must be doing something right.

'I'm like a rock star, so I've got haters. These people aren't happy. I look at them and think, you must be so deeply unhappy in your life to be making so much of an effort to comment on mine.'

'I just can't have that in my life': Earlier this week, Lauren revealed in this week's New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame

Earlier this week, Lauren revealed in this week's New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. 

She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.

'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me. 

'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".' 

The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.

Lauren recently broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.

Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. 

Declaring she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she insisted she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.
