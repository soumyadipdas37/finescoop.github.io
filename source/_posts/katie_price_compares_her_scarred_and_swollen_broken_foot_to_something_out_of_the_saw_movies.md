Katie Price has compared her broken feet to 'something out of the Saw movies'.

In her latest YouTube video, the former glamour model, 42, is seen taking her daughter Princess, 13, for a day at the spa.

Katie broke both her feet while on a family trip to Turkey a few weeks ago, and asked Princess to explain to the camera what they look like beneath their bandages.

'It's literally like from her heel down to there is like a massive scar like outside the skin,' was Princess' graphic explaination.

Painting a further picture, Katie admitted: 'It looks like something out of the movie Saw.'

Saw is a 2004 torture porn horror film in which a man has to slice off his own foot in order to escape a trap, set by a serial killer.

The film launched a super-successful franchise of movies that were released every Halloween for seven successive years, all with similar themes of civilians having to go through acts of violence - to themselves or to others - in order to survive a 'game'.

The franchise made a comeback in 2017 with eighth film, Jigsaw, and a ninth is set for release in 2021, titled Spiral. 

Katie, meanwhile, was seen enjoying a lunch date with her Love Island star boyfriend Carl Woods at Mayfair's swanky Novikov restaurant on Tuesday.

She is recovering from the surgery she underwent earlier this month on her feet, and was spotted as Carl pushed her along in her wheelchair. 

Katie is also getting around on a scooter. She is currently in the middle of a two year driving ban.

A source told MailOnline: 'Katie will be able to claim back a bit of independence. The scooter has been given a total make over by Robbie at Valetmagic...

'He reached out to Katie offering his team to work their magic, putting a smile back on her face will certainly be speeding up her recovery.'

The star added to The Sun: 'I won't be breaking any speed limits on this - that's for sure.' The scooter has been customised to Katie's standards and features a 'Pricey' registration plate. 

Katie recently revealed she was stepping out of the spotlight on Thursday on medical advice as she has been told to 'rest in order to heal'.

Amid the social media hiatus, Katie appeared in a promotional fake tan video shared on her Instagram on Sunday evening - with her representatives confirming this was a pre-scheduled post. 

They said: 'I can confirm that Katie has not returned to social media.  Katie's team posted the Instagram and this was not posted by Katie herself.

'It was  filmed prior to her hiatus.'
