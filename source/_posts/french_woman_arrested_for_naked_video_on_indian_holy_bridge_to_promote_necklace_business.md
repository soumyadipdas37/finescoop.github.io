A French woman has been arrested for filming herself naked on a holy bridge in India to promote her necklace-selling business.

The 27-year-old now faces charges under India's internet law and up to three years behind bars if found guilty.

'She told us she sells bead necklaces online and the shoot was aimed at promoting her business,' R.K. Saklani, head of the police station, said. 

But the woman said she posted the video to raise awareness of harassment that females experience in India.

Authorities detained Marie-Helene on Thursday after she allegedly posted footage of herself on the Lakshman Jhula in Rishikesh. 

The footbridge over the Ganges river was made famous by the Beatles in the 1960s and remains a draw for backpackers and yoga practitioners.

'Maybe in France these things are not considered objectionable,' Saklani said.

'But Rishikesh is a holy place and the Lakshman Jhula is the place where (Hindu gods) Ram, his brother Lakshman and wife Sita crossed the Ganges.'

Police identified Marie-Helene by her first name only and said she had been in Rishikesh since March - just before its nationwide coronavirus lockdown was imposed.  

The woman apologised on Sunday and said 'I am sorry my actions hurt the local community'. 

'I was lacking awareness on cultural specificities,' she added. 

Marie-Helene told AFP though that no-one else was around when she carried out the stunt, and she did it to raise awareness over harassment in India.

'I chose to partially uncover on Laxman Jhula because each time I crossed the bridge I felt I was being harassed.

'My Indian sisters and fellow female travelers surely have experienced the same,' she wrote.

'The main goal was to help oppressed Indian women to access education and to leave abusive marriages or situations, where there are no other options or help.'

The French woman had also taken naked pictures inside a hotel room, Saklani added.

Police were alerted after the footage and photos were posted on social media.

The woman has been released on bail and the case could take months to complete, the officer said. 

Her mobile phone was seized as part of the investigation.
