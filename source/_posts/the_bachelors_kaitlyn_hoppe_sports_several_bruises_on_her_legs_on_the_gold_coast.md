She is one of the breakout stars from this year's season of The Bachelor.

And the 26-year-old personal assistant turned heads for a different reason on Sunday as she stepped out on the Gold Coast with friends.

The blonde bombshell sported a number of bruises on her legs while arriving at the Burleigh Pavilion beachfront bar.

A number of purple marks were visible on Kaitlyn's knees, shins and calves as she paraded her trim pins in a stunning floral mini dress.

The bruises didn't seem to bother her, however, as she beamed with happiness while chatting to a female pal.

At one stage, she was spotted texting someone on her phone, possibly arranging to meet up later in the evening. 

Ouch! A number of purple marks were visible on Kaitlyn's knees, shins and calves

Kaitlyn looked every inch the reality TV debutante in her thigh-grazing frock, which she paired with strappy nude heels. 

She styled her long blonde hair loosely, and opted for a glossy makeup look and lashings of dark mascara. 

Last month, a heated argument between Kaitlyn and co-star Roxi Kenny stunned viewers of The Bachelor.

A jealous Roxi, 29, became furious after discovering that Kaitlyn had kissed leading man Locky Gilbert at the cocktail party.

At one stage, she said within earshot of Kaitlyn: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.' 

'That's classless. She's Gold Coast trash,' she added.

'This little silly b***h over here is saying she packed on with someone. It's disgusting. The b***h is a sl*t!'

As things became heated later on, Roxi labelled Kaitlyn 'Malibu Barbie gone wrong', before screaming over and over again that she was 'trash'.

Meanwhile, Kaitlyn repeatedly held her hand up in front of Roxi's face and told her to 'go cry', which only aggravated her further.

Viewers had plenty to say about the dramatic confrontation, with many fans picking sides on Twitter.

'Both Roxi and Kaitlyn were out of line tonight but I'm team Malibu Barbie, what a crack up,' tweeted one viewer.

'Mmmm kind of on Roxi's side, Kaitlyn is being horrendous,' another added.  

Hot stuff: Kaitlyn is a real estate agent and an Instagram model. She once partied at the infamous Candyshop Mansion in 2018 wearing lacy lingerie

Another sarcastic fan wrote: 'I'm with Roxi... what was Kaitlyn thinking kissing the guy whose romantic attention she is trying to secure?'

Meanwhile, one disgruntled viewer claimed the only losers in this situation were the fans who had been subjected to the argument.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10

Lucky girl! Kaitlyn was awarded a one-on-one date with Locky on episode two of the show after entering the series as an intruder
