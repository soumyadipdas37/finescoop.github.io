One of Britain's first gay fathers has welcomed his second daughter, with his eldest daughter's ex-boyfriend via surrogate today. 

Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, 50, who is originally from Manchester, is engaged to his bisexual assistant Scott Hutchison, 25, who previously dated his 20-year-old daughter, Saffron, for several months. 

The couple announced earlier this year they were expecting a baby together in October, but this morning revealed that their baby daughter has come a month early. 

Barrie revealed they feel 'totally blessed' that their daughter Valentina Willow Drewitt-Barlow has arrived, sharing an adorable video of the newborn to his Instagram.

He penned: 'Welcome to the world out beautiful daughter - Valentina Willow Drewitt-Barlow x our girl is almost a month early but she is perfect. We feel totally blessed x I love you Scott x'.

The post racked up nearly 600 likes in just four hours, with friends and family hailing the newborn 'beautiful' and wishing 'all the best' for the couple.   



Last month, Barrie proposed to his daughter's ex-boyfriend - while on holiday with them both. 

The romantic moment took place on a motor yacht near the Croatian island Hvar. Barrie had decorated the boat with candles and rose petals as well as laying out a bottle of champagne.

Barrie's post racked up over 3,000 views and over 200 likes, with several users congratulating the pair and hailing them the 'perfect couple'.  

Barrie followed up the post by sharing pictures of himself posing with both Saffron and Scott, hailing his daughter 'his everything'.  

Barrie and his former partner Tony, 55, hit headlines in 1999 when they became the first same sex couple to be formally registered as parents. Their surrogate gave birth to twins Aspen and Saffron.

The fathers, who are worth £40million and live in a £6million 10-bedroom mansion in Florida, went on to have three more children.

Barrie has said Scott, his PA of seven years, became a 'shoulder to cry on' when  former partner Tony, who is now in remission, was in hospital during cancer treatment in 2018

The couple previously announced they were expecting triplets, but in April shared a scan photo revealing just the one baby girl is on the way

The pair, who made their millions through ventures including a surrogacy agency and medical research firm, became civil partners in 2006 and married in 2014.

But Barrie previously told how they 'slid into a platonic relationship' after Tony was diagnosed with cancer in 2006.

He said Scott, his PA of seven years, became a 'shoulder to cry on' when Tony, who is now in remission, was in hospital during treatment in 2018. 

Last year Barrie announced that Tony remained his 'true love' but they had ended their 32-year relationship. 

Meanwhile Saffron has said she is 'not bothered' by her father and ex's relationship, provided they are happy together.

Earlier this year Barrie revealed he is expecting a baby girl with his daughter's ex-boyfriend via surrogate, with Barrie's ex Tony agreeing to be the baby's godfather. 

Their surrogate, Marie, is from San Francisco and has previously worked with the couple for their agency, the British Surrogacy Centre. 

The couple transferred three blastocysts (embryos) - two girls fertilised by Scott and one girl fertilised by Barrie. 

All three men and the Drewitt-Barlow's children still live together in their Florida mansion, which has separate wings.
