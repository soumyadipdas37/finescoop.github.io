Royal Mail is issuing a set of stamps to mark the 100th birthday of popular children's character Rupert Bear.

The eight stamps feature the artwork of Alfred Bestall, who wrote and illustrated more than 270 Rupert stories.

The set is made up of four pairs of stamps, each pair featuring two illustrations from one of Rupert's adventures - Rupert's Rainy Adventure (1944), Rupert And The Mare's Nest (1952), Rupert And The Lost Cuckoo (1963) and Rupert's Christmas Tree (1947).
