Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham revealed that former FBI Director James Comey will testify in his probe of alleged FBI misconduct just weeks before the November elections.

Graham, a Trump loyalist who has been probing the FBI's 'Crossfire Hurricane' investigation that kicked off the Russia probe, announced the development on Fox News host Sean Hannity's program.  

"The day of reckoning is upon us when it comes to Crossfire Hurricane,' he said.

Graham said Comey had agreed to come voluntarily, without need for a subpoena. He indicated an ongoing push to bring in former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, like Comey another top target of President Donald Trump's.    

'I appreciate Mr. Comey coming before the committee and he will be respectfully treated but asked hard questions. We are negotiating with McCabe; we are hoping to get him without a subpoena -- time will tell,' said Graham.

Graham said Mueller, who like Comey also delivered blockbuster testimony in Congress last year, won't be coming. 

'Mueller has declined the invitation to the committee to appear to explain his report," Graham said. He said Mueller 'says he doesn't have enough time." 

Graham said the committee has also invited former FBI lawyer and investigator Peter Strzrok, another Trump target, to testify.

Democrats have blasted the probe as a partisan exercise. Trump has continued to fume that the Obama administration 'spied' on his campaign. 

Meanwhile, U.S. attorney John Durham continues his probe of alleged FBI misconduct. Last week, a top aide, Nora Dannehy, resigned in what colleagues told the Hartford Courant was a move influenced by pressure to take action before the elections.

Graham made additional cryptic comments on Hannity's show earlier this week, following disclosures that devices belonging to Mueller's team had been wiped before they could be analyzed.

'You think you are mad about the phones being wiped?' Stay tuned. We'll talk in about 10 or 12 days and we'll see if there is something else you can get mad about,' he said.

t is unclear if he may have been referring to Comey's testimony or some other development.
