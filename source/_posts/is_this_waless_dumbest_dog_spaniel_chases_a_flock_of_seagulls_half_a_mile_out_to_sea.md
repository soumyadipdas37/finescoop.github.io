A spaniel has been rescued by a lifeboat after chasing a flock of seagulls half a mile out to sea.

The dog ran away from its owner and into the sea off the coast of Rhyl, Wales, just before 9am on Monday morning.

Rhyl coastguard launched a lifeboat 11 minutes after the call was made and filmed the moment it picked the tired pup out of the water.

The dog was found off the new SC2 waterpark site to the west of the town, reported North Wales Live. 

Its owner was told to stay on the beach and not attempt to rescue his stricken dog.  

The dozy dog ran away from its owner and into the sea off the coast of Rhyl, Wales, just before 9am on Monday morning

Footage filmed from the lifeboat and posted on the RNLI Twitter page showed a rescuer tell the dog 'you're not supposed to be this far out'.

He then whistled and said 'come here', encouraging the dog to paddle closer to the boat.

The video cuts to the moment the dog was close enough for a rescuer to pull it into the vessel.

He said: 'Come here. What are you doing?'

Once the dog was inside the boat, the team radioed to tell the coastguard the dog was on board. 

At the end of the video the dog's owner held tightly onto the spaniel's collar as he thanked the team that rescued it

Martin Jones, RNLI Coxswain for Rhyl's RNLI Lifeboat, said: 'There was initial worry the owner would attempt to rescue the dog, but on the coastguard's advice, remained on the beach, keeping the dog in sight.

'We are so happy the animal and it's owner are reunited.'
