The son of a bashing victim has slammed public prosecutors after two Irish tradies were acquitted of his father's murder and allowed to return home despite agreeing to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.

Nathan Kelly, 23, and Christopher McLaughlin, 25, agreed to plead guilty for manslaughter following the death of cancer patient Paul Tavelardis who was left bloodied and beaten in Summer Hill, in Sydney's inner west, on December 29, 2018.

The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the plea, which would have led to a prison sentence, and pursued the more severe charge of murder which on Monday they were found not guilty of.

On Monday, the pair was released from custody and flew home to Donegal in Ireland - a move which sparked fury in the pensioner's son Bradley Tavelardis.

'It pains me to think that as a society, Australia has decided that if you are drunk you are no longer accountable for your crimes,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 

'The bare fact remains that my father, a 66-year-old man who suffered from leukaemia, was beaten by two physically fit men in their early 20s and subsequently died from the ­related injuries.' 

Prosecutors had argued the flatmates had repeatedly hit the pensioner after he fell to the ground - a claim denied by both men.

The victim survived in hospital for nine days before he died.

Paul Tavelardis spent nine days on life support after the brutal attack on December 29

Mr Tavelardis said seeing the extent of his father's injuries and deciding to turn life support off was the most harrowing moment of his life. 

Kelly and McLaughlin offered the guilty plea on the basis of excessive self-defence, claiming the victim tried to break into their ute and attacked them with a pole when they approached him.

Mr Tavelardis rejected the claim and explained that his father, who had $90,000 in his bank account at the time of the assault, was 'not a thief' and had no reason to start stealing cars as a senior citizen. 

He said to have all charges dropped was 'inconceivable'.

Kelly and McLaughlin spent more than 20 months on remand and have since had their working holiday visas revoked.

Over the three-week trial, the jury had heard the two men had been drinking heavily throughout the afternoon and evening before the 12.30am incident.

After lying down in Summer Hill railway station and stumbling around the suburb, they got in a car and loudly drove laps of the suburb.

On their return to Grosvenor Cresent, where they also lived, the two men said they found Mr Tavelardis trying to break into Mr McLaughlin's ute.

Both men's barristers said, after a short conversation, the older man struck out at Mr Kelly with a metal pipe.

In earlier evidence, the court heard one witness who watched the bashing yelled out for them to stop, to which one of the men responded 'I don't care'. 

A neighbour recalled hearing a loud scream of 'fear' and peering out his window to see Mr Tavelardis run around his car with a large item in his hand towards the tradesmen.

But the other men began viciously beating him, the neighbour told the jury.

Police arriving on scene a minute later found Mr McLaughlin standing in the middle of the street, with bloodied knuckles, fingers and ankles.

In a later police interview, Mr Kelly lifted his top to show a welt on his back where he said Mr Tavelardis had struck him on the back. 

Mr Kelly had been kicked out of the pub before the attack while McLaughlin was described by a witness as 'blind drunk' about 11pm.
