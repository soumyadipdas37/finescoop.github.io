Kyle Sandilands and his girlfriend Tegan Kynaston have taken their relationship to the next level. 

Less than a year since they debuted their relationship, the pair have moved into a $5000-per-week mansion in Sydney's affluent suburb of Woollahra, according The Sunday Telegraph. 

Located a few minutes drive from radio co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson's mansion, the sprawling, three-storey home boasts extreme privacy and lavish interiors.  

It's getting serious: Kyle Sandilands and his new girlfriend Tegan Kynaston (pictured) have moved in to a $5000-per-week three-storey Woollahra mansion, reports claim 

Kyle and Tegan's love shack! The ultra-private home is set on almost 1094sq metres and boasts seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, and a large outdoor swimming pool

Built in 1923, the extravagant home boasts seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, and a large outdoor swimming pool. 

It boasts a grand marble entrance leading into a large foyer with bevelled glass windows and a wide staircase. 

The property, which is set on 1094sq metres, also features a marble powder room and an under-stair mudroom.

The Woollahra property has been meticulously renovated for living and entertaining while maintaining its grand circa 1910 stately character and privacy.

The home's elegant decor is world's away from the Mosman mansion once shared with Imogen Anthony - which included animal skin rug and a life-size giraffe statue. 

Kyle began dating personal assistant Tegan just under a year ago, after splitting from his long-term girlfriend Imogen Anthony. 

The radio titan announced his shock split from his girlfriend-of-eight-years on The Kyle and Jackie O Show in November last year.

He told listeners the couple 'haven't been living with each other' for months and their relationship had simply 'run its course'.

'We haven't been with each other for quite a few months now. Unfortunately it's run its course,' he said.

Tegan is the director of communications for Sandilands' company, King Kyle Pty Ltd, and was previously the radio star's personal assistant.

The couple went public with their romance on New Year's Eve, when Tegan shared a picture of herself kissing Kyle on the cheek in front of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. 

Two months earlier, she had denied rumours she was dating her employer.
