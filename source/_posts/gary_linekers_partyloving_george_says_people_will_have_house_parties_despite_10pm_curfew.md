George Lineker, the party-loving son of Match of the Day host Gary, has sparked controversy by rubbishing the Government's 10pm curfew, saying people will 'defo have house parties' to ensure they can continue socialising late into the night. 

The 28-year-old eldest son of the former England star tweeted his frustration at the latest nationwide laws designed to try and curb a second wave of coronavirus hitting the UK. 

George slammed the decision, asking for a 'good explanation' as to why restaurants and bars will have to close their doors at 10pm and suggesting the country should just 'crack on' and leave the hospitality industry to bounce back.

Son of Match of the Day host Gary vented his frustration over the new 10pm curfew for hospitality, asking for a 'good explanation' on Twitter





He wrote: 'Anyone give me a good explanation why it benefits having a 10pm curfew? 

'It’s like you have dinner at 8 and then get kicked out at 10 cos the virus might be in the restaurant then and not before. 

'If you wanna do something about the time, don't let people in a venue after 10. Idiots.' 

When Twitter user @mrjohn12345678 offered his version of why the decision had been made, saying: 'Data suggests people drink more after 10pm and therefore lose sense of social distancing etc', George replied, saying: 'everyone will be on the streets p***** at 10.'

A frustrated Lineker suggested that people will 'defo have house parties' when the shutters come down in bars and restaurants and admitted he would 'love a rave'. 

He added: 'Damage done from another lockdown will be worse than the coronavirus damage. Let’s crack on.' 

George's comments garnered plenty of support though, with people agreeing that the curfew is unlikely to affect the way people visiting pubs drink, suggesting they'll find another venue at 10pm

One Twitter user suggested George should 'grow up' but plenty agreed that young people will just find another way to party.  

@RebeccaRowds wrote: 'A 10pm curfew will surely just increase the chances of house parties with little social distancing?!'  

@BigEyedView added: 'People will just start earlier and drink faster to ensure they are suitable p****** by the time they leave. Means the “huggers” will be hugging at 9 instead of 10. Also expect “few drinks back at mine” to go through the roof.'

Last week, George's uncle, Wayne Lineker was criticised online after revealing a bizarre list of criteria for his future girlfriend - which includes 'giving up her career, having no children, being able to cook and loving R&B'.

Wayne, pictured, added: 'You must like older men but only me...You have to be a worldly and above 30 (OK, 28 or 29 could work) but not my age as that would just look weird'

The list (above) was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked criticism on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands

Gary Lineker's brother Wayne (pictured centre, surrounded by women) has revealed his bizarre criteria for his future girlfriend - which includes 'giving up her career, having no children, being able to cook and loving R&B'

The list was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked outrage on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands - such as 'loving the gym and having body definition' and not being the same age as him because 'that would just look weird'.

'Truly unprecedented levels of creep exuding from Wayne Lineker these days,' one unimpressed Twitter user wrote.
