David Clark, who taught at Richmond School in North Yorkshire for 23 years, was trampled to death by a herd of cows yesterday

A popular deputy head teacher has been trampled to death by a herd of cows while walking his dog.

David Clark, who taught at Richmond School in North Yorkshire for 23 years, died yesterday afternoon in a field on the outskirts of the town.

Emergency services including the police and Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) were called to the scene. 

It is believed the married father had been walking his dogs at around 6.30pm when he was charged by a herd of cattle that trampled him to death.

Pupils at the school, which has just returned after the coronavirus lockdown and the summer break, were upset when his death was announced in a message to parents this morning.

Tributes to 'good guy' Mr Clark were led by headteacher Jenna Potter, who said in a statement today: 'Dave Clark was the 'heart and soul' of Richmond School. 

'He was an enormous character, a brilliant school leader and simply a lovely man who enriched the life of everyone he came into contact with, just by being himself and doing what he did every day.

'Dave was always the person we looked to to deal with difficult issues and he was a master at that. He never let students get away with being anything other than their very best, never giving up on them, even when at times it felt as though they wanted to give up on themselves. 

'All of this, Dave did with a smile and a level of kindness and care that is seldom seen.

'Outside school, Dave was a keen sportsman. He had grown to love the Dales and would often be seen cycling, walking and spending time on the moor during the beating season.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Clark was educated at Jordanhill College in Glasgow and was a keen cyclist, swimmer and rugby coach 

'Our students and their parents have been lucky to have known and been helped by him. We have been privileged as a staff to have worked with him and will continue working in the same way in his memory.

'Above all, Dave was a family man. Our thoughts are with Dave's wife, his children and wider family at this difficult time.' 

'Dave was killed as a result of an accident as he walked his dogs in the countryside.

'Dave worked at Richmond School for 23 years and was the heart and soul of the school, taking such pride in his very important work.

'Dave was not only an admired colleague, he was also a much loved friend and member of the local community and I know that many of you, as parents, will have very fond memories of being taught by him.' 

One parent said that all four of his children had known Mr Clark over the years and spoke very highly of him.

Another said: 'He was really popular, one of the good guys. It's just incredibly sad. He'd been there forever - even when pupils had left he remembered their names and would ask how they were doing.'

His local cycling club paid tribute to him on Facebook, saying: It is with immense sadness that we learned today that one of the club's most respected and long standing members, David Clark passed away due to a tragic accident. 

'David was walking with his dogs on the outskirts of the town, off the town's Hurgill Road, on Monday evening when the incident happened. 

'Our thoughts are with David's family and friends who must be devastated and within the club there is deep sadness and shock.'
