A Canadian cancer sufferer was left in tears after twice being turned away from her local bingo hall for not covering her breathing hole with a mask.

Elaine Arbeau, 67, from Whitby, Ontario, planned on going to the Delta Bingo in Pickering earlier in August.

Arbeau has suffered from various types of cancer over the last 20 years, and now relies on a hole inserted into her neck to breathe, her son explained on Facebook.

She cannot breathe if she covers the hole.

'My mom doesn't go out much unless its to play at a casino or bingo hall these days for her enjoyment with her friends,' wrote her son, Joe Gilbert. 

'With Covid happening she was home bound for 6 months before they opened up a bingo hall. Not to play bingo yet the machines were available. Like most people she too was excited to go play and see her friends again.'

However, on arriving at the bingo hall she was turned away by the manager for not covering up her breathing hole with a mask.

Gilbert said his mother was escorted out of the building by Lucy, the operations manager - bursting into tears when she left.

Feeling bad, Lucy then tried to invite her to return, but Arbeau, humiliated, left.

Arbeau got in touch with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, who said that she should be allowed to enter, regardless of the breathing hole. 

On Saturday, Gilbert said, she tried again - but was once again refused entry.

This time his mother captured the incident on camera, as the manager on duty explained that she could not enter the bingo hall, and passes on the phone number of the head office.

Joe Gilbert, Arbeau's son, said no one in his mother's condition should have to suffer the humiliation of being turned away  

Arbeau was once again left in tears.

'My poor mom has no voice so I'm hoping by getting this out there many people will join me to give her one,' said Gilbert. 

'This should never happen to anyone in my moms position.' 

Cam Johnston, the CEO of Delta Bingo, told CTV News Toronto on Sunday that he will take a 'hard look' over the case. 

But he said people who cannot wear masks should not be visiting their establishment at this time.

'I'll make a judgement shortly,' Johnston said. 

'But we would prefer that people who are unable to wear masks do not attend. I think it's best for them.'

Johnston told the station that he empathizes with Arbeau but said safety has to be his 'number one priority at this time.'

'We're trying to protect everyone but my first concern and first obligation is the health and safety of all our customers and staff,' he said.
