An Australian tradesman has been called a 'champion' after offering his support to anyone struggling with mental illness during the COVID-19 crisis.

Jack Nile, from Huskisson on the NSW south coast, posted a video to his Elite Lawn and Garden Care Facebook page last week.

The 23-year-old gardener shared a powerful message to Australians having a hard time in the fallout of coronavirus.

'I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to say that if you’re going through a rough patch in your life, especially given the circumstances of people not being able to work and what not, you are not alone – you don’t have to bottle things up inside,' he said in the video.

Gardener Jack Nile (pictured) posted a video on Facebook to inspire his followers to open up about their internal battles

'My door is always open and I'll always pick up the phone and have a chat.' 

Mr Nile said it is not weak to speak out about your personal issues.

'If you need to vent to anybody or just have a yarn I am here if you want to speak to someone without the feeling of being judged,' he captioned the post.

'No judgement here. I will always listen.'

The video has more than 5,000 views, with several comments praising Mr Nile's offer to the community.

'You’re the best Jack. Always going above and beyond. Keep doing what you’re doing!' one comment reads.

'You're a champion! The world needs more people like you!! Thanks for being you,' another says.

Mr Nile said he became aware of the depths of mental health struggles after spending four years in the army. 

He told Yahoo News Australia he wanted to be able to help people after watching some of his former colleagues lose their way.

Mr Nile offered his support to anyone suffering from mental illness and reminded his followers he is available for a chat if they need

'When they got out of the army they felt like they were alone and their life was going downhill,' he said.

Mr Nile said he received hundreds of messages from a wealth of friends and followers after his video went viral on Wednesday.

He hoped his video would inspire others to get the courage to open up about their internal battles. 

'People can see they’re not alone and are more obliged to speak up,' he said.
