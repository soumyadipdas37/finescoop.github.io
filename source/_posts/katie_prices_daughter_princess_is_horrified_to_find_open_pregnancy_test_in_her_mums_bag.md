Katie Price's eldest daughter Princess was horrified after discovering what she believed was an open pregnancy test in her mum's bag.

During Katie's latest YouTube video 12 Hour Hair Transformation, the teen, 13, confronted the former glamour model, 42, on why she had the kit.

Katie had asked her daughter to help rub her feet with cream after breaking her ankles earlier this year during a freak accident. 

What is this! Katie Price's eldest daughter Princess was horrified after discovering what she believed was an open pregnancy test in her mum's bag

While looking for the products, Princess pulled out the test and asked: 'One thing, why is there an open pregnancy test? I brought it just to show you that it's open.'

Brandishing the 'pregnancy test', Princess confirmed: 'An open pregnancy test!'

Katie's boyfriend, who she has been in a relationship with for four months, seemed equally shocked and said: 'What? Let's have a look at that. That's interesting, where did you you find that?'

Explain! During Katie's latest YouTube video 12 Hour Hair Transformation, the teen, 13, confronted the former glamour model, 42, on why she had the kit

However he soon explained: 'These aren't pregnancy tests. They're ovulation kits.' 

Katie then admitted she had already used one after Princess revealed that there was one missing from the open pack.

Carl told Princess: 'It means that you could have a brother or sister if it's a smiley face.'

Katie added: 'That means you have to have sex when you see a smiley face.'

It would make sense that Katie had bought ovulation kits after revealing last week that  she and beau Carl have decided to take things to the next level by trying for a baby and moving in together.

She also started dropping some strong hints that she's ready for marriage.

Speaking on new YouTube channel The Adventures Of Katie And Carl, the couple discussed their plans after she purchased an ovulation kit.

While holding onto the box Carl told his girlfriend he was 'glad that you got it. It's actually kind of cute that you got it.'

After getting over the initial shock of seeing the kit and blurting out 'for f***s sake', the hunk appeared keen on the idea of trying for Katie's sixth child, telling her that they weren't getting any younger.

Carl said: 'If we're going to make a baby then we need the ovulation kit. I'm 31 - I'm getting older. You're 42 - you're even older.

'So we need to know, don't we? I don't want to be an old dad. Do you want to be an old mum?'

Oh boy! After looking a little shocked at first, Carl soon got onboard with the idea and mentioned that they weren't getting any younger

Katie, who turned to the camera and laughed as her cheeky beau referenced her age, joked: 'I already am - but I'd like to be older.'

Carl then went on to say: 'It's a really good idea, Kate. Did you get this today [the ovulation kit]? And why did you buy this?'

Katie, who later revealed they've 'talked about a lot of things', replied: 'For the same reason you said, because of our discussions we've had.'

He said: 'Our discussions about having kids. This is important because if you're coming to move in, we're taking steps.'  

Katie also dropped some heavy hints that she's ready for marriage number four during the video.

Big commitment: Katie also surprised her boyfriend with a Wedding Day Yankee Candle, dropping a not so subtle hint that she was ready to exchange vows

Bold: After giving Carl his cheeky gift, Katie agreed that if it had been a leap year she would have already proposed to her boyfriend of three months

After presenting the ovulation kit, Katie handed another bag to Carl which contained a Yankee Candle called Wedding Day. 

Laughing at the find, Carl said: 'If it was a leap year, would you have asked me to marry you already?'

Not pausing for a second, Katie responded: 'Yes, without a doubt. Because I know you're the right one.'

And it seems Carl has been a fan of his girlfriend's for some time as he revealed the four things he wanted Katie to bring to his Essex home were mostly Jordan related.  

Loved-up: The couple explained that they'll be moving in together at Carl's Essex home but still staying at Katie's abode when she has all of her five children

While unpacking their car Carl held up the 2004 Jordan calendar which he said 'all blokes will know to be an essential item'.

As well as the throwback calendar from Katie's glamour model days, two huge canvas pictures of the star were also brought into their new home,

Carl said: 'I don't want to date Jordan, I just like to look at her. 

'It feels like I'm 15 again, had them all [the calendars], just different versions. Now I feel like I've gone back again and I've again got Jordan on my wall.'

Katie then asked her beau 'how does it feel having the person in the pictures living with you?' to which an enthusiastic Carl replied: 'I'm over the f*****g moon.'

Happy: After chatting about trying for a baby and marriage the pair shared a sweet kiss and got on with moving in Katie's belongings 

Explaining their home set-up, Katie said she still has her house and will stay there when she has all her five children with her.  

Talking about the move in, Carl joked: 'This is where I sign my life away, because she'll be here 24/7 now.' 

Katie and Carl have been dating for four-months now and it was claimed on Monday that they beauty is 'rushing through' her divorce so she's free to marry again.

A source told The Sun: 'She's asked her team to rush it through, whatever it takes... She's keen to end the marriage so she's free to marry Carl if he proposes.'

The model married husband number three, former stripper Kieran, in 2013 and the pair share children Jett, seven and daughter Bunny, five. They split in May 2018.

'Essential': One of Carl's must-have-items of Katie's to be moved into the house was her Jordan 2004 calendar, which he said he had other year's versions off as a teenager

Throwback: A huge canvas of Katie's face was carried up the stairs by Carl in his Essex home

During their marriage Katie accused him of cheating with her best friend of 20 years, Jane Pountney, as well as sleeping with pal Chrissy Thomas and nanny Nikki Brown. 

Kieran said in March that their divorce was close to being finalised, but it is thought proceedings slowed when Katie went to The Priory.  

A representative for Katie confirmed that the star is set to sign her divorce papers this week, but denied she was 'rushing the process'.

They added that the mother-of-five is 'excited' about what her future holds with new beau Carl. MailOnline has also contacted Katie's representative for a comment.
