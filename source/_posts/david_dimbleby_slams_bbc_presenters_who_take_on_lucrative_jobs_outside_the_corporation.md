David Dimbleby appeared to take a sly swipe at Naga Munchetty as he slammed BBC presenters who take on lucrative jobs outside the corporation.

The 81-year-old, who hosted political debate show Question Time for 25 years, also criticised Boris Johnson's attacks on the BBC as he raised concerns about its future.

It comes amid reports that Downing Street is looking to axe the TV licence fee and instead fund the BBC through viewer subscriptions. 

David Dimbleby has slammed Boris Johnson's attacks on the BBC as 'frightening and dangerous' amid concerns about the corporation's future

Mr Dimbleby told The Times: 'If you present the news you shouldn’t go off and earn 20 grand for chairing a paint conference.'

He added that hosts should not be using social media in order to boost their public profile. 

'I've never tweeted... anything that dents the feeling that you are trying to be as objective and dispassionate a possible is just wrong.'

Naga Munchetty was recently rapped by corporation bosses after appearing in a business interview series for NatWest.

The BBC Breakfast presenter, who earns up to £195,000 per year, hosted webinars for the banking giant weeks after she was rebuked for fronting a paid corporate video for car maker Aston Martin.

She already appears to have antagonised new director general Tim Davie, who has launched a radical shake-up of the national broadcaster to dispel accusations of partiality.

The BBC previously told MailOnline Munchetty has been warned the gig 'could be seen as a conflict of interest and will be kept in mind for future editorial decisions.'



The 45-year-old is the latest in a slew of stars at the corporation including Huw Edwards, Greg James, Mishal Hussain and Jon Sopel, who have topped up their hefty salaries with payouts from oil companies, banks and car giants.  

Mr Dimbleby did also not pull his punches when it came to speaking about Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 

The veteran broadcaster said: 'I am very dismayed by the Johnson attacks on the institution. I think they are crowd-pleasing. I think they are quite dangerous. I don't think they will work.' 

'Margaret Thatcher always had it in for the BBC but she wasn't trying to destroy it… A lot of people who support Johnson also quite like the BBC. I don't know what is going on in his mind. I think it's quite frightening.'

Turning his attentions to the Prime Minister's chief aide Dominic Cummings, he said: 'All prime ministers have had gurus, but I find this Cummings thing deeply offensive… that whole business about Barnard Castle was really offensive.' 

'There is something obnoxious about him,' he added. 'He's like a machine gun. Remember the Battle of Omdurman. 

'The army just massacred a whole row of people on top of the hill and you feel like that at the moment.

'It's not that easy to dismantle things, shrinking the BBC, getting rid of all the senior people in the civil service, attacking the judiciary. 

'It is the Bash Street Kids but to what end?'

His claims come after Downing Street signalled a new onslaught on the BBC with a threat to scrap the television licence fee and turn it into a subscription service. 

The 81-year-old also described the Prime Minister's chief aide Dominic Cummings as 'a machine gun' prepared to 'massacre' British institutions 

Mr Dimbleby said: 'All prime ministers have had gurus, but I find this Cummings thing deeply offensive…that whole business about Barnard Castle was really offensive'

A senior source said the broadcaster could be forced to sell off most of its radio stations in a 'massive pruning back' of its activities.

The source told The Sunday Times that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was 'really strident' on the need for serious reform. 

The paper said that the number of BBC television channels could also be reduced, the website scaled back and stars banned from cashing in on well-paid second jobs.

The attack will be seen as a further escalation of the hostilities between No 10 and the corporation, with many Tories still angry at its coverage of last year's general election.

The Government is already consulting on proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, and ministers have suggested it could be abolished altogether when the BBC's charter comes up for renewal in 2027.

JON SOPEL, £245,000-a-year BBC salary: Jon Sopel, 60, is paid up to £245,000 a year in his role as the broadcaster's North America Editor, covering all aspects of US news including politics, policy and business.

But the presenter last year sparked a conflict of interest row after accepting tens of thousands of pounds from the biggest bank on Wall Street.

Mr Sopel boosted his pay by speaking at a string of JP Morgan events – despite it posing an apparent conflict of interest. 



Jon Sopel presided over two sessions at JP Morgan's Global Markets Conference in Paris in 2017 – which included an interview with Mr Dimon. And in 2016, Mr Sopel appeared at JP Morgan's Board Summit in New York.

And in 2016, Mr Sopel appeared at JP Morgan's Board Summit in New York, where he interviewed a former president of the European Commission about what Brexit 'means for global business'.

Sources say he was paid around £35,000 for the Paris conference. He is thought to have received around £20,000 for the New York event.

He is also known to have hosted other JP Morgan events. Mr Sopel's agent Mary Greenham said: 'He has done events for JP Morgan and the BBC are aware of this.' 



Earlier in 2019, he spoke at an event by Philip Morris International, the world's biggest tobacco company. 

Mr Sopel lives in Washington with his wife, but keeps a four-bedroom house in Hampstead worth more than £2million and a £1.2million flat in London's Belsize Park.

MISHAL HUSSAIN, £255,000-a-year BBC salary: The Radio 4's Today programme presenter, 47, took part in at least 10 functions and in January appeared at the Oslo Energy Forum.

Ms Husain moderated the event - which she has also been apart of at least five times previously - but it is not known how much she was paid.

However other BBC stars are listed on speaking agency websites as being able to charge between £10,000 and £25,000 to attend corporate events.

At the forum Ms Husain moderated discussions on topics such as 'climate action in a world of cherished entitlements'.

As well as the three-day Oslo Energy Forum appearances, Ms Husain has attended a conference staged by Equinor, Norway's state-controlled oil company.

HUW EDWARDS, £495,000-a-year BBC salary: Huw Edwards has raked in an estimated £400,000 in speaking fees in the last five years.

The News at Ten anchor has fronted at least 16 events since the start of 2014, and commands fees of up to £25,000 a time. 

He is also thought to have hosted numerous other events over that period – but the BBC does not make the engagements public or keep a central register so the extent of his moonlighting work is unknown. 



Mr Edwards does not tend to accept money from firms that could be a conflict of interest. He also undertakes charity events for free. However, he has fronted a series of events for railway firms, regional law societies and insurance brokers.

In 2019, he hosted the National Rail Awards in London and also fronted events for the Birmingham Law Society, the Women's Institute and Thames Valley Business Magazine.

He also hosted the British Insurance Brokers Association conference where Boris Johnson revealed his ambition to be Prime Minister. 

According to JLA, one of the speakers' agencies which has him on their books, he charges between £10,000 and £25,000. 

The BBC said that none of the events broke its impartiality rules.

GREG JAMES, £229,999-a-year BBC salary: Radio 1 DJ Greg James was paid £100,000 by oil giant Shell to front an online campaign which plugged the company's 'green' credentials. 

The 34-year-old, who broadcasts to around 5.6 million listeners each Monday to Thursday, fronted a five-part series for Shell called The Great Travel Hack.

The Top Gear-style programme followed two teams of competitors racing from London to Istanbul while using environmentally friendly vehicles.

Sources close to the PR campaign claimed that James was paid £100,000 to feature in the videos, which have been watched 81 million times since Shell uploaded them to its YouTube channel last October.

KAMAL AHMED, £209,999-a-year BBC salary: In February, the editorial director of BBC News apologised for accepting a £12,000 payment for speaking at a banker's conference, adding that he will not be taking any money from organisers. 

Kamal Ahmed is understood to have received £12,000 for a 40-minute appearance at the Aberdeen Standard Investment's conference, days after telling 450 of his colleagues that their jobs were being cut.

Ahmed – who is listed on the Speakers Associates website in the £10,000 to £25,000 per appearance category – took part in a panel discussion hosted by Steph McGovern, his former BBC colleague who now works for Channel 4.

He came under fire both publicly and within the BBC for his £12,000 fee for the event and subsequently sent an email to colleagues apologising.

Ahmed said in his email that he was asked 'some months ago' to talk about 'economic issues' by the investment firm and that he was not asked to talk about anything related to the BBC.

He is the previous Economics editor at the corporation. 



Ahmed, who earns between £205,000 and £209,999, was one of four senior BBC bosses who sat on bar stools as they announced the job cuts.

He drew criticism after he turned up for the 'bloodbath' announcement wearing a black T-shirt and casual trousers.
