Back on? Stacey Hampton and Michael Goonan [pictured] continued to fuel rumours of a romantic reconciliation as they put on a flirtatious display during a trip to the hairdressers on Monday.

Kyle decided to ring the exes after a called named Monique claimed to have seen the exes getting flirty on the Gold Coast.

'Are you banging that Michael again?' the 49-year-old radio host cheekily asked Stacey.

The blonde replied: 'No, we're just friends and we're civil. He had a fun time. He was hooking up with multiple girls while we were on the Gold Coast!'

When asked if she was one of the 'multiple girls', Stacey reiterated they were merely friends.

Businessman Michael confirmed Stacey's claims when asked by the radio hosts straight after.

Speaking of her relationship status with Michael, the blonde replied: 'No, we're just friends and we're civil. He had a fun time. He was hooking up with multiple girls while we were on the Gold Coast!'

Discussing Stacey's claims that he was 'hooking' up with other women, Michael said: 'Look, I dunno. If you're single, you're single! I was just having a bit of fun. Gotta make the most of being on a reality TV show [sic]'.

When addressing his current relationship with Stacey, he gushed: 'Stacey's one hell of a wing-woman.

'We're just good friends. She's not that stupid [to get back with him],' he added.

Despite confirming they were not together, the pair couldn't resist sharing a flirt during a trip to the hairdressers.

Ever the gentleman, Michael paid for Stacey to get her locks done at the salon. 

Confirmation of their relationship status comes after a source told Daily Mail Australia about Michael's secret hopes to reconcile with Stacey romantically.

'They're good friends now, but Michael wants her back,' the source said this month.

Michael previously made a public appeal on Instagram for her to give him another chance - as mates.

'Wanna be my friend again?' Michael previously made a public appeal on Instagram for her to give him another chance - as mates.

Earlier this month, Michael shared a throwback photo of the former couple in happier times and wrote: 'So publicly Stacey. Wanna be my friend again?'

The millionaire's plea to Stacey came after his break-up with fellow Married At First Sight star KC Osborne in July.

KC blamed their break-up on Michael's unwillingness to change his 'playboy' ways.
