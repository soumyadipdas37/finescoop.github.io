The mother wore a pair of matching sparkly stilettos and held a bunch of flowers she had been gifted by a young royal fan upon her arrival. 

She teamed her look with an elegant white blouse and swept back her blonde hair in a chic bun, while opting for a natural makeup look. 

The royal couple appeared to smile at other guests as they entered the grand venue this evening, before taking their seats near the front of the stage.  

The mother-of-four was joined by her husband  King Philippe, 60, with whom she shares children Princess Elisabeth, 18, Prince Emmanuel, 14, and Prince Gabriel, 16 and Princess Eléonore, 12.

Philippe cut a sharp figure in a double breasted jacket paired with matching suit trousers teamed with an orange tie and baby blue pocket square, while wearing an understated black face covering. 

The initiative for creating the piece came from the Belgian choir and was commissioned by the City of Ghent, who has dedicated the year 2020 to celebrating Jan van Eyck, a Dutch painter. 

The composition was inspired by the altarpiece The Adoration of a Mystic Lamb by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck, located in St. Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent. 

The concert took place under the baton of the world-famous Belgian conductor Philippe Herreweghe and the choir will also be celebrating its 50th anniversary with this concert.
