April Love Geary was chic to the hilt when she enjoyed a Los Angeles stroll this week with her two-year-old daughter Mia.

The 25-year-old blonde bombshell slid herself into a tight black cocktail dress and slung on a matching leather Yves Saint Laurent bag.

Her latest outing comes amid a swirl of rumors that she is pregnant with her third child by her dashing fiance Robin Thicke.

Off she goes: April Love Geary was chic to the hilt when she enjoyed a Los Angeles stroll this week with her two-year-old daughter Mia

April and her beefcake pop star, who is 17 years her senior, are already the proud parents of two-year-old Mia and one-year-old Lola.

Less than two weeks ago Us Weekly reported that the dynamic duo are now awaiting the arrival of their third little pride and joy.

Last month April swung by her social media to brush off the internet trolls who have criticized her for her figure after she had two children. 

'Just letting you know that I'm not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was "so much more attractive" when I was skinnier,' she said.

'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' April added cheekily. 

Robin also has a 10-year-old son called Julian Thicke whom he shares with his ex-wife, actress Paula Patton. 

April, who joked on her 23rd birthday that Robin was 'gonna have to swap me out for a younger chick soon,' has been with Robin since 2014.

Robin married Paula Patton in 2005 after dating her since they were teenagers, and they brought Julian Fuego into the world in 2010.

After they separated in February 2014, Robin waged a public campaign to get Paula back, including an album named Paula with a lead single entitled Get Her Back.

Despite his efforts Paula filed in October 2014 for a divorce that was ultimately finalized the following March.

Paula and Robin waged a rancorous custody battle over Julian - one that they settled weeks before April told the world she was pregnant with Mia.
