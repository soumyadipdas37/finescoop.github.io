For years, Margaret Thatcher’s portrait has been the only one of a woman to adorn the famous yellow staircase at 10 Downing Street.

But yesterday, it was finally joined by a photo of Theresa May, the country’s second woman prime minister.

For years, Margaret Thatcher’s portrait has been the only one of a woman to adorn the famous yellow staircase at 10 Downing Street. But yesterday, it was finally joined by a photo of Theresa May, the country’s second woman prime minister

Portraits of former prime ministers line the staircase chronologically, so Mrs May is positioned next to her predecessor David Cameron. Once a PM is out of office, his or her photo is added to the No.10 wall

Once a prime minister is out of office, his or her photo is added to the wall, then all the other pictures are shuffled down the staircase. 

Art historian Simon Schama once said in a documentary on Downing Street: ‘Where you might have in other great houses of state, even in the White House, huge portraits, larger than life size, here [in the UK] we have modest engravings and photographs of the ghosts of Downing Street.’
