Thiago Alcantara may yet remain a Bayern Munich player rather than move to Liverpool or Manchester United. 

The gifted Spaniard has been heavily linked to both Premier League rivals and there is an expectation that he will leave Bayern having helped deliver the Champions League as his parting gift. 

But Thiago has now insisted that if a suitable offer is not put on the table he will be happy to remain at Allianz Arena. 

Thiago Alcantara admitted he would be happy to stay at Bayern, following Spain's 1-1 draw with Germany on Thursday night in Mercedes-Benz Arena

The Bayern star was instrumental in the club beating PSG in the Champions League final 

Speaking after Spain's 1-1 draw with Germany in which he played the full 90 minutes, the 29-year-old told ZDF: 'I only think about the game against Ukraine. Afterwards, we will see. 

'Bayern is my home and I am happy to be there.'

Hansi Flick previously expressed his desire to keep hold of Alcantara, who proved his worth again with brilliant performances in the Champions League when football resumed. 

And no doubt Bayern fans will take heart from the midfielder appearing to open the door to a prolonged stay. 

Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp are the front-runners for Alcantara but United are also keen 

Alcantara's contract at the club expires at the end of the upcoming season and they are asking for a transfer fee of £27million from prospective buyers. 

Liverpool are still front-runners for his signature but are only likely to make a move if one of the current midfielders departs. 

Georginio Wijnaldum is of interest to Barcelona and could be replaced by Alcantara but Jurgen Klopp is otherwise likely to be inactive in the market. 

United signing Donny van de Beek is not thought to mean the Old Trafford club will end their interest in the Bayern star. 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also thought to be interested in bringing Alcantara to Old Trafford
