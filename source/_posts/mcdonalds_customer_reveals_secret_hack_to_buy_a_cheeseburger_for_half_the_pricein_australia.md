A McDonald's customer has revealed a sneaky hack for buying a cheeseburger for half price.

Josh Garlepp filmed his journey through a McDonald's drive-thru in Perth, Western Australia, and posted it to TikTok on Sunday. 

In the video, he asked a restaurant employee whether he could add a slice of cheese to his hamburger, valued at $1.50. 

McDonald's cheeseburgers are priced at $3.55 - more than double the cost of a hamburger - but the only difference between the two is a single slice of cheese.

In the video, he asked a restaurant employee whether he could add a slice of cheese to his hamburger, valued at $1.50

'Sorry I'm not allowed to do that,' the worker responded,

'Can I get cheese on the side then?' he asked.

The staff member agreed and gave the social media user an extra box cheese on the side for an extra 20c.

Mr Garlepp revealed he paid $1.80 for the DIY cheeseburger, saving $1.75.

The footage then showed the social media user eagerly putting the cheese on his burger while The Voice by John Farnham played in the background.

Former McDonald's employees flocked to the comments section and revealed they hate being asked to serve cheese on the side.

'People used to order this and I'd put the box on the heat mat and make sure the cheese was so melted it couldn't be out on the burger purely out of spite,' one ex worker wrote.

'I had a customer abuse me and then try this so I put the cheese in the microwave before I gave it to them,' another shared.

One baffled user accused Mr Garlepp of being 'tight' with money.

'Umm okay CEO of BHP,' he replied.

'It all adds up. I bought a Porsche and a Porsche jet ski (very rare) with the savings.'

But other users were excited by the prospect of using the money saving tip.

'Not all heroes wear capes,' said one person.

'Australians need to be more like you,' another wrote.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted McDonald's for comment.
