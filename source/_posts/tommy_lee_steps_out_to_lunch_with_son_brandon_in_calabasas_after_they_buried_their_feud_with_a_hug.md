Tommy Lee was pictured stepping out to lunch with his 24-year-old son Brandon at the Calabasas Commons this weekend.

The 57-year-old Motley Crue drummer showed off his arm tattoos in a T-shirt that read: 'PLEASE EVOLVE.'

Their friendly public sighting comes two years after they buried their feud with an Instagram hug - in the months following an alleged physical fight between them.

Tommy shares Brandon and a 22-year-old son called Dylan with his ex-wife Pamela Anderson with whom he famously starred in a sex tape.

Brandon and Tommy hugged out their differences in an Instagram picture posted in December 2018, eight months after their alleged altercation.

Tommy posted the picture and captioned it simply: 'I love you son,' leading Brandon to comment: 'Love you dad.'

They allegedly went went toe-to-toe in March 2018, resulting in injuries severe enough to warrant a hospital trip for the drummer.

Tommy went off about the fight on Twitter at the time, writing: 'My fiancée [Brittany Furlan] and I were in bed when my son busted into the room and assaulted me. I asked him to leave the house and he knocked me unconscious. He ran away from the police. THAT’S the truth.'

The LA County Sheriff's Department confirmed that they responded to the incident at Tommy's home at the time of the alleged altercation.

After the incident, Tommy Lee posted a photo of swollen and bloody lips as evidence of the attack.

It was captioned: 'My heart is broken. You can give your kids everything they could ever want in their entire lives and they can still turn against you

Brandon responded shortly thereafter, telling People: 'I’m devastated at the events of the last several days that have been a result of my father’s alcoholism.'

He claimed: 'I’ve worked tirelessly organizing an intervention and it’s incredibly upsetting that it never came to fruition.'

'I wanted my dad’s hopeful sobriety and recovery to be a private family matter but, as a result of his accusations on social media, I feel forced to speak out. I have and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as needed. I love my father and just want to see him sober, happy and healthy.'

Tommy served six months in custody in connection with domestic violence after he pleaded no contest to felony spousal battery in 1998.

Prosecutors in the case said that the rock star had attacked Pamela as she was holding a then-infant Dylan.

Tommy was also married to actress Heather Locklear from 1986 through 1993, and Elaine Bergen from 1984 through 1985.

His engagement to Brittany Furlan culminated in a wedding on Valentine's Day 2019 and the duo are still married.
