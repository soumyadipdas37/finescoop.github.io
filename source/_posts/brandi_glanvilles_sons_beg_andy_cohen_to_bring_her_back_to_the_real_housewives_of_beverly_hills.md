Brandi Glanville left the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills in 2015 after just three seasons, but has made frequent appearances as a guest on the hit Bravo show over the years.

And Brandi, 47, recently enlisted the help of her two sons, Mason, 17, and Jake, 13, to convince executive producer Andy Cohen, 52, to bring her back as a full time cast member.

Mason told Cohen on the most recent episode of the Brandi Glanville Unfiltered podcast that Brandi 'deserves' to be brought back because her drama with Denise Richards was central to last season's storyline.

The confrontation regarding the possibility of Brandi's return to the RHOBH was first initiated by the reality star, herself, before her sons gave their two cents to Andy.

'What's the excuse now?' asked Glanville after explaining to Cohen that his prior assumption that the series' stars 'didn't like her' was no longer true.  

'I don't know the answer to that. You're not on an island, but you're not exactly friends with any of the women,' he replied. 

She then told Andy that she has formed a frequent texting relationship with RHOBH star Kyle Richards and also happens to be 'very close' with Richards' sister Kim.

'I would say you're as close to being back as you've been in a long time,' admitted Cohen, just before Mason chimed in on the conversation.

Mason first informed Andy that him and Jake's father, Eddie Cibrian, 47, who allegedly wanted his sons off of the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, has had a change of heart.

'Now that we are allowed to be on the show, are you gonna give my mom a second chance?' asked Mason to Andy point blank, to which Andy replied: 'And you want your mom on the show why?' 

'Because she deserves it. You kind of milked her for everything this season to make some views and stuff and she hasn't gotten even half as much as the other Housewives,' explained Mason.



Deserves it: Mason told Cohen on the most recent episode of the Brandi Glanville Unfiltered podcast that Brandi 'deserves' to be brought back because her drama with Denise Richards was central to last season's storyline

He added: 'I feel like she should be compensated. She's the best woman I've ever met.'

Mason was referencing to the alleged affair between his mother and Denise Richards, who recently quit the series after just two seasons earlier this month, and how it played a central role in the season 10 plot. 

Andy, shocked by Mason's candidness, told the 17-year-old that he '[made] really good points.'

While Mason was grilling Andy, Brandi's youngest son Jake was busy at school and unable to confront Andy on the podcast.

Plea: Brandi's youngest son Jake filmed a video for Andy that Brandi, eventually, shared to her Instagram Story

Just a question: 'I was wondering if you would do the right thing and give my mom her job back like you said you would?' asked Jake

So, the 13-year-old filmed a video for Andy that Brandi, eventually, shared to her Instagram Story. 

'I was wondering if you would do the right thing and give my mom her job back like you said you would?

'Because she was like the main focus of the whole season and like get her money back so we can move out of this place and get her what she deserves,' concluded Jake. 

Andy has yet to reply to Jake's passionate plea and he has not brought up the subject of Brandi's potential return on any of his social media pages.
