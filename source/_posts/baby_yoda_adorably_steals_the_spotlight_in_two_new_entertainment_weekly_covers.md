Aww! Baby Yoda has stolen the spotlight in two new Entertainment Weekly covers featuring the stars of The Mandalorian

The green creature peeks over the edge of the satchel with a curious and super cute expression. 

With his innocent features, The Child - affectionately known as Baby Yoda amongst fans - has become the breakout star of the series.

'Last season, the Child was on set and we weren't sure with the puppet if we would even use much of it — and it turned out, we used a lot of it ,' executive producer Dave Filoni explained to EW.

'But in season 2, he was the biggest thing on the set. There was a total shift around him. Everybody liked him before, but he wasn't quite the celebrity that he was in season 2. This time, he was quite a big deal.'

'Even as a puppet, you can't walk by the Child without having an interaction, because it's so very sweet and innocent,' said Giancarlo Esposito, who plays Moff Gideon.

Season two of the smash hit Star Wars spin-off will be returning of Disney+ on October 30.   

Some of the famous names being lined-up to join the much-anticipated second season include Timothy Olyphant, Rosario Dawson, Michael Biehn, Temuera Morrison and Katee Sackhoff. They will join Pedro Pascal as The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda.

Good timing: 'We were lucky enough to have finished photography before the lock down,' he said of the production timeline,' creator Jon Favreau said in July; seen in 2019

The Mandalorian is currently nominated for 15 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.   

In June series creator and head writer Jon Favreau confirmed during a virtual panel for the ATX Television Festival that the show would debut its second season in October.

'We were lucky enough to have finished photography before the lock down,' he said of the production timeline, according to Collider. 

'Thanks to how technology-forward Lucasfilm and ILM are, we have been able to do all of our visual effects and editing and post production remotely through systems that had been set up by those companies for us,' Favreau, who also serves as executive producer and showrunner, added.

The acclaimed Iron Man director also gave a glimpse into what fans can expect in the much-anticipated season two.

'We are building what people loved about the first season,' he said of the upcoming season that will debut on Disney+.

'It doesn't feel like the next season, it feels like we are continuing.'

Bonafide hit: The western-inspired sci-fi epic Star Wars spin-off earned monstrous popularity with its eight-episode first season

Favreau continued: 'As we explore partnering with new filmmakers and having new characters and going deeper with the characters we already have, it's really been very fun and fulfilling and I hope people are having as much fun seeing it as we are having making it.' 

The western-inspired sci-fi epic series earned monstrous popularity last year thanks in part to the cute little alien called The Child, or 'Baby Yoda' as he's come to be known across social media channels.

During he ATX Television Festival, Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed episode four titled Sanctuary, revealed her two young children inspired that soup sipping Baby Yoda moment.

The Jurassic World star, 39, said her kids, Theodore and Beatrice, were always asking about Baby Yoda during filming of the first season. 

'My kids were on set pretty much every day. Even before we came to set, when it was the storyboards for the episode,' she explained.

'My [then six-year-old] daughter would come into the editing room and whenever Baby [Yoda] wasn't on screen, she would lean over to me and be like, where's Baby? Where's Baby? Where's Baby?’
