The Duchess of Sussex nailed a summer chic look as she chatted to famous feminist and activist Gloria Steinem for Makers.

Meghan Markle, 39, teamed a pair of pinstripe pants by Anine Bing $250 (£220) with a classic white t-shirt as she sat down with the activist, 86, for a conversation about women's rights, representation, and the importance of voting.

The royal completed her look with a $356.00 (£270.67) wide-brimmed 'serena' straw sunhat by Janessa Leone, which featured a pinched crown and felt ribbon with chin strap, and a pair of Stella McCartney vegan leather sandals, which are currently discounted to ($346) £263.  

And it wasn't long before royal fans took to the comment section to praise her outfit of choice.

'The hat. So Californian! Love this whole look really,' enthused one, while a second agreed: 'Oh I just love this look on her! So effortlessly glamorous.'

A third added: 'Killing this look. Love it!' while a further commented: 'Love love love this look.'

Meghan accessorized with her trusty Monica Vinader friendship bracelet and a Cartier bracelet she's owned for years.

The Anine Bing's 'Ryan' pants are made from herringbone-jacquard woven with sharp contrasting stripes.  





Royal fans were quick to take to the comments section, with one writing: 'Killing this look. Love it' (pictured)

The online product description reads: 'They sit flatteringly high on the waist and have pressed pleats that enhance the straight-legs.'

Meghan Markle appeared overwhelmed with excitement at points during her 'backyard chat' with Gloria, 86, which was filmed last month for Makers Women, a women's empowerment platform that will stream the Q&A in full on Wednesday. 

However, in a short teaser clip that was posted on social media on Tuesday afternoon, viewers got a glimpse at Meghan and Gloria together, looking totally at east while relaxing in wooden deck chairs in a lush yard.

At one point, the pair are even joined by Meghan's beloved dogs, black Labrador Pula, and rescue beagle Guy, who happily wandered into the camera shot during the chat, and lay down at the Duchess's feet while she continued chatting with Gloria.  

During the conversation, the mother-of-one - who moved back to the US with Prince Harry and their son Archie in January, expressed her joy at being back in her home country. 

'Meg, welcome home, I'm so glad that you're home,' Gloria said to the Duchess at the start of the clip, prompting Meghan to respond: 'Thank you. Me too, for so many reasons.'
