It actually was not so long ago that a very young Valencia fan, Ferran Torres, hung around the gates of Ciudad Deportiva de Paterna waiting for David Silva. An autograph, a picture, anything to add to his bedroom shrine to the club in the quaint little town of Foios.

Now he is a Manchester City player - and one who owns Silva's iconic No 21 shirt. There are still occasional reminders that romance does sometimes exist within football.

Torres did not have to ask for Silva's property this time as the pair headed in opposite directions, Silva back to Spain with Real Sociedad, Torres to the North West for an initial Â£21million from the Mestalla. City offered him the opportunity to take over his childhood hero's shirt and the answer was swift.

Ferran Torres wants to make history at Man City just like his childhood hero David Silva did

'It is a huge honour to inherit his number, just for what it means here,' Torres said. 'I have really good memories of watching him. I remember looking for David Silva above the rest after training sessions. I will try to give my best to be part of the history of this club. I will try to follow David's steps.'

The electric right winger is not short on confidence then. Pep Guardiola will hope his attitude, a fearlessness of what lies ahead, translates into giving City the sort of explosive counter-attacking edge they lacked last season.

Torres is ready to go, fresh from a Spain debut and first international goal on the back of a pre-season boot camp in Portugal with personal trainer, Alberto Pardo. He arrived in England on Monday, opting to live alone to begin with, concentrated on mastering the language and exploring the city. Sister Arantxa, six years his senior and closest confidante, is a FaceTime away.

'I think this is the best place I could be,' Torres said. 'When I spoke to Pep he told me to come to Manchester, that my arrival would be important for the team and that he envisioned the club as a great place for me. From that point, to be honest, I was absolutely convinced to come. With Pep I can reach my full potential.'

SIlva won four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and five League Cups with the Etihad outfit

Torres should excite supporters, the sort of flamboyant forward who will get bums off seats once crowds return. A nutmeg enthusiast, a mesmeric dribbler. Someone who loiters in space and waits for that precise moment to motor. The sort of characteristics that shone in Leroy Sane when he came here at exactly the same age, 20.

Torres can play right, left or even as a false nine and wants to present versatility to a team that will play every three days in this truncated season.

Privately, his target is double figures in both goals and assists during his first campaign in England and there are familiar faces to help him settle. Eric Garcia has come through the Spain ranks, Rodri is now an international team-mate too.

Torres admires fellow Golden Boy nominee Phil Foden, also 20, after competing against him over the years. He has told friends of relish at the prospect of them becoming mainstays together. While that is for the future, he understands the present obstacles of earning a place.

'City is one of the best clubs in the world and being here is always a challenge,' he said. 'Every window, if the situation is not good in one position, the club can find someone in the market. It's a challenge for me to play at a high level and for the rest of the team too, so that they do not look for a replacement.

'My first impression (of the squad in training) was to look up to them and be aware that I have to learn. In the pitch they are going to make you a better player, but from my side I know I also have to do my job and rival them.'
