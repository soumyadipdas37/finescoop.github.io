Shape Up Britain volunteer Chris Shutt used to snore the night away on a regular basis — though he was blissfully unaware of it himself.

The same could not be said, however, for his long-suffering partner Liz, 51.

‘Liz tells me that she’d often have to nudge me awake at night so I could turn over,’ he confesses.

But fortunately for both Chris and Liz, restless nights are becoming a thing of the past after Chris lost 1st 10lb on my Fast 800 diet in just eight weeks.

As I discovered, the size of your neck is a good indicator of whether you snore. If you are a man with a neck size of 17in or more, you will almost certainly be a snorer. For women, it is 16in or more

‘Liz is now happy to report that I’ve stopped snoring,’ says the 61-year-old engineer from Sheffield. 

‘And I’ve noticed that my sleep quality is better. I’m not waking up as groggy in the mornings.’

Chris was one of 30 volunteers from two communities at opposite ends of the country who jumped at the chance to overhaul their weight and health in a ground-breaking experiment for our Shape Up Britain challenge.

In total, they lost an astonishing 39st 8lb and 9ft 8in from once bulging waistlines. 

Chris alone shed 5in from his middle, but it’s his new neck measurement which proved life-changing once his head hit the pillow. In eight weeks, he lost an inch off his neck, which went from 17in to 16in.

As I discovered, the size of your neck is a good indicator of whether you snore. If you are a man with a neck size of 17in or more, you will almost certainly be a snorer. For women, it is 16in or more.

That’s because fat around your neck narrows your airway, which then partially collapses and vibrates when you are asleep, making that loud snoring sound.

Before I slimmed down, my snoring could be heard all over the house, and I had a neck measurement of just under 17in.

At the time I didn’t think much of it, but looking back I realise it was a clear sign that I was overweight, and unhealthily so as it turns out.

I’d been putting on weight gradually from my mid-20s to my mid-50s, but I didn’t think it was a real problem because I didn’t look particularly overweight. So when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2012, I was shocked and horrified; I hadn’t seen it coming.

But it turned out that my slightly flabby tummy meant I was carrying a lot of visceral fat (the unhealthiest type), which doesn’t just sit around your waist but also clogs up your liver and pancreas, and is linked to an increased risk of serious diseases.

This is partly because visceral fat behaves in a metabolically different way from the type of fat you can see — for instance, that on your thighs — as we saw earlier this week. In particular, it affects the effectiveness of your immune system, making it harder for your body to deal with attacks from viruses such as Covid-19.

Unwilling to treat my diabetes with medication, I decided to change my lifestyle. I discovered intermittent fasting, lost 1½ st — and got rid of my diabetes. (This also led, in time, to me developing the Fast 800 diet).

When I lost weight, my snoring stopped, too, much to my wife Clare’s relief.

Drinking alcohol before bedtime interferes with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep — the most mentally restorative phase — causing you to wake early.

Several of our volunteers indulged in a few extra glasses in lockdown, and were desperate to break the cycle. ‘I became anxious about going to bed,’ says Rachel McGarty, a 51-year-old teacher from Rotherham.

But after swapping ‘a bottle of wine three nights a week’ for soda water with lemon and following the Fast 800 diet, she’s lost 1 ½ stone. ‘Now I’m waking up feeling refreshed,’ she says.

‘The plan has made such a difference to my sleep,’ says 67-year-old Jackie Mosley, from Chudleigh, Devon, who lost 11 lb. ‘I used to wake up at 2am. Now I sleep from 10.45pm to 7am.’

Her neighbour Victoria Bateman, 35, who works in hospitality and lost 1st 1lb, agrees: ‘I’d never slept straight for eight hours before — it’s incredible!’

There’s evidence that nutrients in a Mediterranean-style diet feed the good bacteria in your gut, which help improve your mood and relax you before bed.



Snoring affects both men and women, though it is more common in men as they tend to store excess weight around their necks. This constricts their airway at night, when they’re asleep and their body is relaxed.

It can also lead to a far more dangerous condition called sleep apnoea, where you stop breathing for short periods of time while you’re still asleep.

Often people with sleep apnoea don’t even know they have it — though symptoms include feeling ‘groggy’ (as Chris put it), difficulty concentrating and a dry mouth the next day.

Untreated, it can also lead to a higher risk of serious conditions, including heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.

In Devon, another of our Shape Up Britain volunteers Stephen Brown, a 43-year-old general manager of a holiday park, and his wife Kelly are also enjoying the novelty of silent nights now he’s lost weight.

‘Now I sleep so well — and my wife says I no longer snore which can only be good for marital harmony,’ Stephen says, after he, too, lost an inch off his neck, which went from 15in to 14in.

Snoring was not the only sleep problem for our plucky volunteers —several were also sleeping badly due to anxiety and low mood.

Anyone who’s suffered the misery of poor sleep knows how debilitating this can be — and lockdown was a low point for many of us.

A number of our volunteers found themselves trapped in an unhappy pattern of poor sleep fuelled by snacking on cakes and biscuits and grabbing unhealthy ready meals, plus a lack of exercise.

Although it is tempting to have a late-night snack, this is a bad idea because your body will find it harder to process food late at night.

Eating before you go to bed means your body has to start up the whole business of digestion just as you want everything to calm down and get ready for sleep. Ideally, you want to stop eating three hours before bedtime.

Today’s recipes are suggestions for suppers that are nutritious but not too heavy. There are also some ideas for puddings which are not too sweet. The important thing is that the balance of nutrients should ensure longer, deeper sleep.

As our volunteers discovered, a low-carb Mediterranean-style diet rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, good fats and protein has the extra benefit of offering a more restful night’s sleep.

‘Life-changing’, ‘a complete shift in lifestyle’ and ‘a revelation’; these are just some of the many compliments our volunteers had for our recipes and our challenge.

We hope that their stories, and our mouth-watering series, have inspired you to join them in transforming your own weight and health.

If you make a start today, in just eight weeks’ time you too could be slimmer, fitter and sleeping more soundly for the first time in years.

Our volunteers took part in the Fast 800 online diet programme, which provides recipes, advice, exercise plans and access to online coaching. They were also given Fast 800 shakes to complement the recipes.

Before they began, they were given comprehensive assessments at Bupa Health Clinics to check blood pressure, diabetes risk, heart rhythm screening, lipid profile, weight and body mass index, for instance. 

They were then reassessed after eight weeks. Dr Arun Thiyagarajan, medical director of Bupa Health Clinics, says the Daily Mail volunteers’ weight loss was ‘impressive’ but stressed they needed to keep up their new habits for the best results.

Healthy Vegetarian Lasagne

Preheat oven to 180c/160c fan/gas 4. Place baking paper over a baking tray and arrange aubergine slices in a layer on top. Brush the slices with 1 tbsp of olive oil on both sides. Cook in the oven for 30 minutes, turning halfway.

Meanwhile, place a saucepan over medium heat. Add the remaining olive oil, onion and garlic and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion has softened. Add the chopped tomatoes, chilli flakes and apple cider vinegar and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season to taste.

Place the ricotta cheese, nutmeg and two-thirds of the basil in a bowl and mash with a fork to combine.

Arrange a layer of aubergine at the bottom of an oven-proof baking dish (use about a third of the aubergine). Spread a third of the tomato and onion mixture over the aubergine. 

Cover with half of the ricotta cheese mix. Repeat the aubergine/sauce/cheese layer again. 

Top the second layer with the remaining aubergine and cover with the remaining sauce.

Heat a pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil, garlic, ginger and onion and cook for 3 minutes, or until the onion turns soft.

Once the onion has softened, add the turmeric, garam masala, and chilli flakes and cook until fragrant. Use a splash of water to stop the mix sticking and cook down again. 

Add lentils to the pot with 2 cups of water and bring to the boil. Turn down to a simmer. Cook for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the dhal has thickened and the lentils have softened and are cooked through. 

Add a splash more water if they need to cook for longer. Stir through the spinach and season to taste.

Divide the mixture over two plates, then squeeze some lemon over your meal and top with fresh coriander.

Cook's Tip: Parmesan cheese contains rennet and is not vegetarian. Instead, use a hard cheese made with plant-based rennet.

Although I found the first four days of following the Fast 800 programme tough, by day ten I’d adapted and was sleeping better.

When you are used to broken nights, it’s the most incredible thing to sleep for a straight eight hours. That had never happened before and it felt great.

I never wanted to be that person who could only live in leggings. But when you are big, tailored clothes, fitted dresses and nice jeans can feel so uncomfortable, even if you can get them in your size, that you just stop bothering.

There’s a lovely, blue lace dress in my wardrobe which I bought from French Connection about 15 years ago when I was a size 12 — and when I started the plan, that became an emblem. I am determined to get back into it.

Aside from wanting to look nice, I have medical concerns about my weight.

I suffer from a condition called sinus tachycardia which causes an abnormally high resting heart rate.

Although doctors haven’t said it is serious, it’s very uncomfortable when your heart suddenly starts pounding wildly for no apparent reason. I’ve been taking beta blockers to control it.

The astonishing thing is, I haven’t had any episodes of racing heart since losing weight — so I haven’t had to take any medication, which feels so uplifting. Have I cured myself? It’s incredible to think so.

I’ve also found my mood has improved and I wonder if the fresh food I am now eating has played a part.

As I was doing the Fast 800 online programme for my husband, we could plan what we were going to eat each day at the start of the week.

That really helps you to resist temptation and not grab something unhealthy for supper.

The recipes don’t involve loads of ingredients, which I like. 

Take the tomato and cannelloni bean soup — so simple to put together but so filling and satisfying. In fact, I’d often take it into work for lunch.

As for that French Connection dress, I’m almost there!
