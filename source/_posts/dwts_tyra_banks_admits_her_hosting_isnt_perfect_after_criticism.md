Tyra Banks made her debut as host of Dancing With The Stars earlier this month, on the show's season 29 premiere. 

And fans of the long-running celebrity competition series were immediately full of criticism, as they mourned the replacement of veteran hosts Tom Bergeron, 65, and Erin Andrews, 42. 

After remaining quiet about the initial backlash on social media, the 46-year-old supermodel shared a video on TikTok, about pushing through her mistakes.    

Speaking up: Tyra Banks defended herself as the new host of Dancing With The Stars after facing criticism on Tuesday night's episode and the show's season 29 premiere 

'Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing with the Stars... and, it wasn't perfect,' the TV host said in the video. 'Yeah, I had a lot of fun but I messed up, I said the wrong words, but the thing is I kept going.' 

Then, Banks compared herself to contestant Skai Jackson, who made a noticeable fumble during her samba with partner Alan Bersten on Tuesday.   

'She got back up and she kept going, and because of that she's here for another week,' Banks said. 'So the message is: I messed up this week, Skai messed up this week, but we're gonna keep on going and going.' 

'Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing with the Stars... and, it wasn't perfect,' the TV host said in the video (pictured on Tuesday's episode) 

'Forgive yourself when you mess up and keep going,' Banks urged her more than 1.3 followers on the video-sharing app.

The former America's Got Talent host has undergone two weeks of trolling on Twitter, with many viewers describing her hosting as 'awkward.' 

On Tuesday night's episode, many pointed to an exchange with Bachelorette alum Kaitlyn Bristowe.

After performing on an injured ankle, Banks asked how Bristowe was feeling, to which the podcast host joked that the 'cortisone helps' and she was 'doing okay.'

After remarking not wearing heels during the performance helped, Banks asked to see her shoes. 

The request led to an awkward silence, before Banks abruptly said, 'Okay, let's get scores.'

Awkward: Fans were confused by the awkward moment between Banks and Bristowe

Issues on set: It was unclear if Bristowe simply did not Banks or if she did not have time to respond 

Fans were confused over the moment, with one Twitter user asking why 'nobody' can hear Tyra, even after she 'repeated herself three times.' 

Meanwhile, another noted the similarity to last week, when Tiger King's Carole Baskin simply did not respond to Banks' question about whether she 'tapped into her inner tiger' during her performance. 

'Carole Baskin not responding to Tyra was just so awkward for TV, I can’t,' one viewer tweeted last week.

After her debut, a flood of DWTS fans desperately begged for the reinstatement of former hosts Bergeron and Andrews, who were shockingly canned in July. 

Bergeron had been with the Dancing With The Stars franchise since it launched in 2005, while his former co-host Andrews joined the show in 2014.

In an interview with Extra earlier this month, Andrews revealed that her and Tom's unexpected dismissals from Dancing With The Stars 'was a surprise' and that hers came via phone call. 

Loss of heart: One Twitter user declared that replacing Tom and Erin with Tyra 'replaced the heart of the show'

Though there was never a direct reason given as to why the pair were axed, Valerie Bruce, general manager of LA Productions, stated that Dancing With The Stars was being taken 'in a new creative direction' for season 29.

She also offered her, 'sincere thanks to Tom and Erin, whom we will always consider part of the Dancing with the Stars' family.'

The pair were let go just days before DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Tyra Banks would be taking over their hosting gig.

'Can Tyra please be the first one sent home?' wrote one fan, referencing to the series' nerve-wracking weekly eliminations.

Another Twitter user declared that replacing Tom and Erin with Tyra 'replaced the heart of the show.'

'Nothing against her, but it just sounds so off when you hear her voice instead of Tom Bergeron's. On a year where people WANT comfort of the familiar... it's just a really poor decision,' they explained.

Even worse: One clearly unimpressed DWTS viewer labeled Tyra as the 'most hated woman on DWTS this season,' above the polarizing Tiger King star Carole Baskin

On blast: 'Who ever came up with putting Tyra on this show needs to be fired,' mirrored another

The Tyra show: Devout Dancing With The Stars viewers accused Banks of making the show 'all about her,' due to her frequent comments and her eye-catching ensembles worn during the premiere episode

Many fans on Twitter aggressively attacked the higher-ups at Dancing With The Stars for 'firing' Tom and Erin.

'The person who fired Tom Bergeron and replaced him with Tyra Banks needs be run out of town. She's awful,' one wrote.

'Who ever came up with putting Tyra on this show needs to be fired,' mirrored another.
