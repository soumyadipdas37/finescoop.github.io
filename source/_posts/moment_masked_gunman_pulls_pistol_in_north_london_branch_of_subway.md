This is the moment a masked gunman pulled a pistol in branch of Subway before losing his nerve and fleeing empty handed.

The CCTV footage was recorded at the store in Neasden, London, on Sunday at 8.05pm.

The hooded assailant can be seen touting a gun and firing shots toward the employees before eventually fleeing back out the door.

In the clip, one customer can be seen standing next to the counter finalising his order as a hooded figure walks through the door.

The suspect, who is dressed all in black, keeps his head bowed and his hood up as he loiters just inside the entrance.

He paces up and down while waiting for the first man to leave before reaching inside his pocket in blue latex gloves to pull out a gun.

The man then points the gun toward a female member of staff and tries to usher her toward the till.

She makes a movement off screen as the assailant shouts: 'No, no, no, no, no. Do you want me to shoot? I'll shoot.

'If you're pressing the button, I'll shoot. Get the money.'

The Subway worker remains calm as the man holding the gun repeats his demand. 

'Get the money. Do you think I'm joking? Get the money,' he says.

The woman begins to speak before the would-be robber fires a shot over the counter.

He raises his voice once again before firing off a further three shots.   

The unidentified male then tucks his gun back into the front of his waistband before edging toward the door while still shouting: 'Get the money.'

Subway and the Metropolitan Police have been contacted for comment.
