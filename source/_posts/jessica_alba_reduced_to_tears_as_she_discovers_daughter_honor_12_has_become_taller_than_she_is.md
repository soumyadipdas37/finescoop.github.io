'The moment you realize your number 1 baby is taller than you,' Jessica wrote in her caption for her 18.4 million Instagram followers.

Along with their eldest, Jessica and her husband Cash Warren share nine-year-old daughter Haven and two-year-old son Hayes. 

Amid the coronavirus pandemic the family are hunkering down at their Los Angeles home which according to Architectural Digest cost $10 million.

The parents of three recently appeared on The Skinny Confidential Him & Her podcast where she discussed how marriage and motherhood have changed her.

Jessica shared that 'I really value the person that I've become in learning how to navigate the world with a partner, with Cash, and then also being a mom to my little people who have taught me, you know, leaps and bounds how to just evolve and try to be more thoughtful, active, conscious person.' 

Jessica and Cash spontaneously decided to get married at a Beverly Hills courthouse one day in 2008 while she was heavily pregnant with Honor.

Cash, who is the son of Hill Street Blues actor Michael Warren, met Jessica while assistant directing her critically savaged 2005 hit film Fantastic Four.

Although she rose to fame as an actress Jessica is also the founder of the consumer goods brand The Honest Company, which she launched in 2011.

During a 2018 interview with InStyle she shared that 'I feel like my purpose in life was to create Honest, and everything led me to that.'
