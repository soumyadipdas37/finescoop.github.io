Less than a month after it was revealed The Voice would be moving from Channel Nine to Channel Seven, it's been reported Mariah Carey will be replacing Delta Goodrem.

According to a report by The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, the 50-year-old superstar is in negotiations to replace the show's longtime judge.

Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton is reportedly in the process of 'wrapping up negotiations' with Mariah.

Meanwhile, Delta, 35, has appeared as a judge on the long-running singing series for all nine seasons, and is the show's only original judge. 

In late August, it was revealed The Voice would be moving from Channel Nine to Channel Seven, leaving its former network furious.  

'Unfortunately due to the age of the show and declining demographic profile, The Voice had become by far the poorest financial performer on our slate,' Nine said in a media statement at the time. 

The added: 'We wish Seven well in their quest to revive yet another Nine show.'  

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Seven for comment.

More to come.
