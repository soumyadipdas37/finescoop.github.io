New Jersey police have been called in to break up a huge crowd of revelers gathered together for an event held by a group of YouTube pranksters. 

The Nelk Boys - a Canadian trio who boast 5.7 million YouTube subscribers - encouraged fans to show up outside a Seaside Heights home for the launch of their new clothing merchandise on Monday evening. 

Footage shared on one of the prankster's Instagram accounts shows hundreds of people cheering outside the residence. 

The attendees were not following social distancing guidelines and most were not wearing face masks, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

New Jersey police have been called in to break up a huge crowd of revelers gathered together for an event held by a group of YouTube pranksters known as The Nelk Boys 

The Nelk Boys were seen popping champagne as they celebrated the launch of their new merchandise range. The group encouraged fans to head down to their rental house to celebrate the event 

Under current rules in New Jersey, outdoor gatherings cannot exceed 500 people and social distancing must be practiced at all times. 

As night fell, the crowd grew larger and more rowdy, sparking serious concerns.  

The Nelk Boys had been staying at the 'Jersey Shore House' - the residence made famous by the MTV reality show which ran from 2009 until 2012.  

Another video posted by the group to their Instagram shows the landlord ordering them out of the house as the situation outside became increasingly chaotic. 

'Get your s**t and get outta here, guys. It's time to go,' the landlord can be heard telling them. 

Aerial footage captured by NBC shows police cars trying to break up the crowd, which had spilled onto nearby roads, blocking traffic.

There are no reports of any arrests,  

Last week, YouTube temporarily demonetized The Nelk Boys' account after video surfaced of them hosting a rowdy party at Illinois State University. 

A company spokesperson accused the popular pranksters of 'creating a widespread public health risk'.

'These creators were encouraging large groups of people to actively disregard social distancing guidelines from local health authorities that were put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, creating a widespread public health risk,' they stated. 

The Nelk Boys are a group of popular YouTubers who hail from Canada. They have previously hit headlines for hosting events that violate COVID-19 guidelines
