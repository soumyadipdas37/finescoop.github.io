Malin's ex Tom Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3 after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

In the new snap, Malin wore a dark grey bikini from the brand Re.Born, and styled her dark hair in a sleek bun while enjoying her day at the spa.

Fellow Love Islander Kady McDermott liked the picture and her other social media followers poured in with positive messages.

The sister of Love Island's Anna Vakili, Mandi, complimented the beauty and said: 'You are A LOT.'

The spa outing comes after Malin recently put on a defiant display in navy lingerie on Instagram as she told fans she had 'finally realised my worth' after having her 'confidence stripped'.

The caption appeared to refer to her ex Tom, 29, who was jailed ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in Instagram posts last year.

But her ex-boyfriend from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Malin and Tom had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter, Consy, was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief.

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety. The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
