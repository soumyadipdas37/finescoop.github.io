This is the chilling moment a woman recorded a stranger harassing her on the street before he groped her breasts, according to police.

The 30-year-old filmed the clip as she walked through Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens, at around 7.05pm on Saturday.

The suspect smirked and waved at the woman, who was walking alone, before he allegedly began shouting: 'Where are you going?'

The police have now released the woman's own cell phone footage after asking for the public's help in identifying the man.

The 30-year-old woman filmed the stranger (pictured) after walking through Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens, at around 7.05pm on Saturday 

In the video, a man can be seen wearing a beige button-down shirt, black jeans and sneakers as he walks down the pavement with a brown leather satchel across his body. 

He crosses the road before stopping outside a clothes shop to turn around and face the woman.

The man smirks and waves toward the camera before even doffing an imaginary cap in her direction. 

He then strolls back across the street toward the woman once again which is where the video ends.
