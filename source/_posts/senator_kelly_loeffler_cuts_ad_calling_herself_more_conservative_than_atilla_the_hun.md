The race to appeal to President Donald Trump's conservative base took an unexpected turn back 1,500 years as appointed Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler cut a campaign ad that calls her more conservative than Atilla the Hun.

The ad features a pair of Georgia voters discussing Loeffler including a ranking that calls her the 'most conservative senator in America.' 

'Yep - she's more conservative than Atilla the hun,' the man in what looks like a husband and wife pair responds.

The ad then cuts to a grunting Atilla the hun seeking to bark orders at his scribe - with obvious comparisons to Trump's stances. 

"Fight China -- got it," says the scribe. "Attack big government -- yeah."

"Eliminate the liberal scribes ... uh oh," he says, looking nervous at an attack with rings of Trump's slams on the 'fake news' media. 

"More conservative than Attila the Hun,' says a narrator, as an image flashes of Loeffler seated with Trump aboard Air Force One. 'Kelly Loeffler: 100% Trump voting record,' it says. 

'It's true,' Loeffler wrote as she tweeted out the light-hearted video.

Loeffler was appointed to fill the seat of Sen. Johnny Isaakson, but must face the voters in her state's 'jungle primary' in November

The ad may have confused Atilla, known by the Romans as the 'Scourge of God,' with Genghis Khan, whose Mongol warriors invaded China

The ad drew notice across political Washington Monday, then drew a brutal counter-attack from Collins, whose campaign didn't have to dig deep for the opposition research file on Atilla the Hun, whose rule in the 400s terrorized the Romans and other ancient peoples across Europe and Asia.

'Fact Sheet: Atilla the Hun,' Collins campaign wrote. 'Favored Post Natal Abortion. Killed Thousands of Christians. Pagan Religion. Polygamist.'

There was even more dirt in the Atilla the Hun file. 'Nicknamed Scourge of the Gods by Romans for his Attrocities. Killed His Own Brother.'

The counter-stroke featured Loeffler's face plastered on a presumed painting of Atilla.

Adding to the oddity of the ad, there are indications Loeffler's camp may have confused the historical figure with Genghis Khan, whose Mongol warriors lay waste to parts of China and other areas. 

Georgia has a 'jungle primary' for the seat, pitting Loeffler against Collins, a conservative House Republican, as well as Democrats. If no candidate gets a majority, the race heads to a runoff.
