The cast of Gogglebox Australia have slammed Ellen DeGeneres' apology following allegations that her show harboured a toxic workplace.

Last month, the comedian kicked off the 18th season of her talk show by telling her audience she was 'taking responsibility' for the scandal while also squeezing in a few jokes.

But during Wednesday night's episode of Gogglebox, the cast lashed out at the 62-year-old for the 'awkward' comedic undertones in her monologue.

'She's obviously not really sorry!' Gogglebox stars have blasted Ellen DeGeneres' 'awkward' apology over her workplace bullying scandal on Wednesday

Millie Dalton explained: 'It undermines the meaning of the apology when you're just cracking jokes.' 

'I feel awkward, I feel awkward watching it... I don't know if I buy it. Actions speak louder than words,' Chantal Bakac added.

Matty Fahd agreed: 'This is super awkward, knowing everyone is watching and hating you, then you have to get up there to apologise and you're obviously not really sorry.'

Matt Dalton also wasn't impressed by Ellen's apology and said: 'She's not addressing the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of workplace complaints about her being nasty. When not one but 300 people complain, maybe there's a smell there.' 

Allegations: Over the last few months, multiple staffers from The Ellen DeGeneres Show stepped forward to accuse the 62-year-old and her senior executives of perpetuating a 'toxic work environment'

Over the last few months, multiple staffers from The Ellen DeGeneres Show stepped forward to accuse the 62-year-old and her senior executives of perpetuating a 'toxic work environment'.  

As she addressed these reports last month, she also squeezed in a few jokes. 

The allegations against Ellen include that she oversaw a workplace which fostered racism, sexual misconduct and bullying. She has apologised to staff privately in a conference call.

Reaction: Matt Dalton also wasn't impressed by Ellen's apology and said: 'She's not addressing the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of workplace complaints about her being nasty. When not one but 300 people complain, maybe there’s a smell there'

APRIL: Ellen staffers' complain about how they've been treated during the pandemic in a Variety report which said producers left them 'high and dry'

JULY 16: BuzzFeed publishes an article alleging a toxic environment including claims that; 

JULY 31: A second BuzzFeed article alleging more misconduct, this time of a sexual nature 

AUGUST: Executive producers Ed Glavin and Kevin Leman, and co-executive producer Jonathan Norman are all fired

SEPTEMBER: Former household staff speak out, saying Ellen treated them 'like nothing' and lay traps like matchsticks to make sure they were dusting 'every inch' of her home 

The show also faced additional accusations of sexual misconduct when dozens of men and women accused Kevin Leman, Ed Glavin and Jonathan Norman of harassment, misconduct or assault.

The program's parent company, WarnerMedia, launched an investigation after a handful of employees went public with their grievances. 

Leman and Norman denied the claims. They and Glavin were promptly suspended while Warner Bros. launched the investigation.

Having her say: On the new season of her talk show, Ellen addressed reports that she treated staffers with little or no respect while also squeezing in a few jokes
