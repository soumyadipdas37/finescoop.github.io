A mother-of-two successfully cleared her name after being wrongfully issued a speeding fine

A mother-of-two who fought a speeding fine and won has urged other drivers who believe they had been incorrectly penalised to take it up with authorities. 

Renae Morrisey was sent a $233 infringement notice and docked three demerit points after a speed camera snapped a photo of her car on a busy Queensland motorway. 

Ms Morrisey was falsely accused of travelling 113km/h in a 100km/hour zone along the Cunningham Highway at Ebbw Vale, outside Ipswich.

But when she looked at the photograph of her car, she discovered a major error.

'There were two cars in the picture and I know I wasn't speeding,' she told Nine News.  

When she contacted Queensland's Road Safety Camera Office they confirmed her suspicions.

A large green circle identifying the speeding car was actually pointing to the other car's number plate.

The fine also identified the guilty driver was travelling in lane number two, when she had been travelling in lane one.

After making the phone call she had the fine revoked. 

The mother-of-two is urging drivers to dispute any penalties they believe were wrongfully issued, with most believing the only way to fight them is through court.  

Andrew Wiseman of Wiseman Lawyers said the first thing to do is pick up the phone.

'Contact the camera office, if you're of genuine belief it's not you or there's an error,' he said.

'A lot of the time, common sense will prevail.' 

Anyone hoping to overturn an infringement will need to contact transport authorities within 28 days of receiving the fine.

After the 28-day period drivers will have to appeal any infringements before the courts.
