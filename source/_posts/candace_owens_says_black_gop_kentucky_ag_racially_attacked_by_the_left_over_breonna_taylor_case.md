Candace Owens has said that black Republican Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has been 'racially attacked by the left' since announcing the grand jury decision in the Breonna Taylor case.

Cameron, 34, revealed on Wednesday that no murder charges would be brought against the Louisville police officers in connection with Taylor's death.

But this has now thrust him into the national spotlight and made him the target of abuse, Owens told Tucker Carlson Tonight.

'For me, it's absolutely infuriating to watch. I've been on the receiving end of the same sort of attack,' the author and activist said. 

'Here's what's so fundamentally wrong and backwards about it... if you actually look at what they are saying and what the deeper implications are here, it's there is a right way, a correct way and a wrong way to be Black. 

'Ironically, that's the very definition of racism and it's coming from the liberals who like to say that they see racism everywhere but they can't recognize it when it's coming out of their own mouth.'

She added that Cameron 'did the right thing by ignoring the various pressures coming from culture and the mainstream media and for that you are seeing him being socially lynched and stripped of his identity because he acted professionally and rationally. 

'This guy should be commended by both sides and instead he's being attacked racially by the left,' she said.    

Cameron, who is the commonwealth's first Black attorney general, is also the first Republican to hold the position in more than 70 years. 

Earlier this week, a Kentucky grand jury brought charges against one of three officers involved in the raid on Taylor's apartment that saw her shot dead by police in front of her boyfriend on March 13.

Officer Brett Hankison, who was fired in the aftermath of the shooting, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment, Cameron said at the news conference.

The charges stem from Hankison's bullets travelling into a neighboring apartment when he and two other officers opened fire.

They do not relate to the shooting death of Taylor. 

Charges of wanton endangerment are brought when a person is found to have recklessly engaged in conduct, without concern for human life, that puts a person at risk of death or serious injury.  

'A person is guilty of wanton endangerment in the first degree when, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person,' state law says. 

Wanton endangerment in Kentucky is a class D felony and can bring up to five years in prison. 

Hankison, who was indicted on three counts, could potentially face up to 15 years.
