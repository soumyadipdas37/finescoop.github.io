The future of British tech giant Arm is hanging in the balance as MPs prepare to debate its controversial sale to a US rival. 

Arm, which makes chips used in almost all of the world's smartphones, is set to be snapped up by US firm Nvidia in a £30billion deal. 

But employees fear the sale could put thousands of British jobs at risk, destroy Arm's business model and take a key technology asset out of Britain's control. 

Debate: MPs will discuss the deal after Daniel Zeichner, the Labour MP for Cambridge where Arm is headquartered, secured an adjournment debate

Today MPs will discuss the deal after Daniel Zeichner, the Labour MP for Cambridge where Arm is headquartered, secured an adjournment debate.

Zeichner said: 'The Government have been painfully quiet about the acquisition so I am pleased a minister must to come to the dispatch box to explain themselves.' 

Zeichner wants the Government to secure commitments that Arm will not fall under US rules which control where products are exported to. President Trump has used these rules to block exports to China, and experts fear Arm could become another pawn in the US-China trade war. 

Zeichner added: 'I find it bizarre that the Government would want to give away such powers.'
