In 2016, Orlando Bloom caused shockwaves around the showbiz world when he was pictured enjoying a naked paddleboarding session with now-fiancée Katy Perry. 

Yet fast-forward four years and it seems the new dad, 42, who welcomed his first child with Katy, 35, last month, has become more bashful. 

The star took a break from dad duty on Monday as he headed to the beach with some pals in Santa Barbara while sporting a very covered up ensemble for a session on his fancy E-surfboard which markets for between $10,000 and $15,000.

During his venture into the ocean, Orlando, with hydrofoil E-board in hand, eagerly headed into the salt water to take his toy for a test drive.

The Pirates Of The Caribbean star had a look of pure bliss on his face as he manned the board with a bluetooth remote control in his hand.

Before he hit the surf, Orlando was every inch the cool customer as he pulled up to the beach in his blue vintage Ford truck, while wearing a cowboy hat.

He kept comfy in a plain white tee shirt and a pair of black board shorts that featured a yin and yang symbol on one leg.  

Orlando retrieved an American flag beach towel, a white rash guard, and his expensive surfboard from his truck before making his way to the water. 

His surf outing comes just days after Katy was granted a restraining order against her alleged stalker William Terry.

William is believed to be homeless and living in a silver Buick sedan, as he's recently been harassing Katy and her family.

According to court documents filed by the Roar singer, Terry has made 'death threats on social media,' including that he wanted to 'snap Orlando Bloom’s neck,' and he has even attempted to enter their home on several occasions.  

She detailed the last instance, which took place September 8: 'Terry jumped the fence of my home in the Beverly Hills area of Los Angeles.

'Security ordered Terry to leave. When he refused he was placed under citizen’s arrest and then formally arrested for criminal trespass by the Los Angeles Police Department.'

Another hearing is set for October 8 to make the restraining order permanent, also protecting their entire immediate family.

With legal protections in place, Katy and Orlando can shift their focus back onto enjoying their newborn daughter Daisy.

The engaged pair announced the birth of their baby girl on August 27 via a statement to UNICEF.

'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,' they wrote.

Katy and Orlando also shared a sweet black and white photo of them holding onto their newborn's tiny hand. 

In homage to her baby girl, the Teenage Dream hitmaker had a white daisy visible on her thumb nail as she held Daisy's hand.

Little Daisy could be seen wearing a white babygro and a patterned hat in the first image.

Though this is the Teenage Dream songstress' first child, Orlando is already dad to nine-year-old son Flynn, whom he shares with ex Miranda Kerr. 

Sneak peek: Katy gave fans a peek at her post-baby body on August 31 (just five-days after giving birth) on her Instagram Story

Perry has been keeping a low profile since giving birth to Daisy, with her first and only outing having taken place on September 12. 

But Katy did give fans a peek at her post-baby body on August 31 (just five-days after giving birth) on her Instagram Story. 

In the photo, she only had on a nude breast pumping harness and a pair of grey high-waisted underwear as she posed in her bathroom mirror.

'Hair and makeup by: @exhaustion,' captioned Perry jokingly, while also tagging the makers of her harness and underwear.

Earlier this month, Katy and Orlando, who get engaged on Valentine's Day last year, postponed their wedding for the second time as they wanted to focus on 'delivering a healthy child' together.
