Brighton striker Glenn Murray has completed a season-long loan move to Watford.

The veteran frontman underwent a medical on Tuesday before finalising his move to Vicarage Road.

Watford moved for Murray to bolster their bid for an immediate return to the Premier League following their relegation to the Championship.

The 36-year-old has become Watford’s second summer addition following the free transfer capture of right back Jeremy Ngakia after he left West Ham.

Murray was a key figure in Brighton’s first two Premier League campaigns and their top scorer in both, hitting 12 and 13 goals and being the only Seagulls player to hit double figures.

Neal Maupay’s arrival at the Amex from Brentford last summer, though, saw Murray’s game time limited last season.

However, Murray is a proven performer at Championship level having netted 67 times in 143 games in the second tier for Crystal Palace, Reading and Brighton.

Murray’s move comes amid interest in Troy Deeney from West Brom while Tottenham are also keeping tabs on Watford’s talisman.
