A 17-year-old boy has drowned at an unpatrolled beach on the New South Wales mid north coast. 

The teenager got into difficulties while swimming with his family at Diamond Beach near Hallidays Point, around 104km south of Port Macquarie, at 1pm on Wednesday.

Police pulled him from the water and started CPR, before paramedics arrived at the scene and took over but he was unable to be revived and died at the scene.

The tragedy happened at the same beach where a man, 38, drowned after getting caught in a rip earlier this year. 

Around 248 people drowned in Australian waterways in 2019-20, according to the latest Royal Life Saving data released earlier this month.

Of those who drowned, 80 per cent were male.
