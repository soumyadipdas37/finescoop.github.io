Viewers have quickly turned on The Bachelor's Bella Varelis lafter her tirade against former best friend Irena Srbinovska. 

And those who know Bella personally claim the 25-year-old is 'devastated' by the way she has been portrayed on the show.  

Speaking to The Wash on Thursday, Bella's friend Nathan Favro alleged the brunette has been 'stitched up' by clever editing this season, and that viewers haven't seen a the whole truth of her feud with Irena, 31.

Nathan, who starred on Ali Oetjen's season of The Bachelorette before appearing on Bachelor In Paradise last year, insisted: '[Bella] has been caught up in a feud with Irena and I can promise you, what you have been shown is not the whole story. She has been stitched up [by the edit].'  

Nathan claimed former fan-favourite Bella is 'upset by the sudden turn' in the way she has been portrayed on the show. 

 

Meanwhile, current contestant Izzy Sharman-Firth also threw her support behind Bella in a comment posted on The Bachelor's Instagram account on Wednesday morning.

Underneath a comment suggesting Bella's 'insecurities' may be to blame for her on-screen behaviour, Izzy hit back: 'Maybe you’re just not seeing the full story.'

Izzy's comment has since been deleted. 

During Wednesday's episode, Bella accused Irena of 'manipulating her way through the show'.

'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.

'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women.

Bachelor fans flocked to Twitter to slam the brunette's behaviour and labelled her a 'hypocrite'.  

'If anyone's manipulating Locky now it's you Bella,' one person wrote, while another added: 'You used to be my favourite!' 

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
