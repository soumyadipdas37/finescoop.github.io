Gareth Bale has been ruled out of Tottenham's match against Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, manager Jose Mourinho confirmed. 

Bale, who is yet to play for Spurs following his return to the club on loan from Real Madrid due to a knee injury, watched from the stands as Tottenham beat Chelsea on penalties in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Tuesday. 

But Mourinho said on Wednesday that Bale should be fit in just over two weeks' time after the international break and added that he will not go away with Wales next week.
