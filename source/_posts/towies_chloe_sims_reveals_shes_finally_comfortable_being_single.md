She has suffered a series of heartaches on and off the small screen. 

But Chloe Sims revealed on Sunday that she's finally found her one true love, and it's herself.  

The TOWIE star, 37, discovered in lockdown that she doesn't need a man in her life and she has accepted the possibility that she may never get married.

Chloe has suffered multiple heartbreaks on TOWIE at the hands of her ex-boyfriends, Dan Edgar, Elliott Wright, and Mario Falcone. 

But for Chloe, it was the time spent away from the camera during lockdown that taught her to love herself instead of another man. 

She revealed to The Sun: 'It has taken a worldwide pandemic for me to really love myself.'

'The whole pandemic put a lot of things into perspective for me and made me realise I am OK being on my own.' 

During the start of lockdown, the mother-of-one was overwhelmed by the 'fear of the unknown' and admitted she didn't feel safe on her own.

It affected her ability to sleep so Chloe would lay awake in bed, turning over her concerns and worries in her mind.

However, the world health crisis forced her to spend time by herself and take a detox from the world of dating. 

The change of action meant Chloe realised she didn't need a man to protect her or keep her company. 

According to the reality star, she said the time out 'made me a better person' and gave her some perspective on what is important in life.

Despite her transformed attitude, Chloe hasn't lost all hope on finding her Mr Right. 

She said: 'The whole pandemic put a lot of things into perspective for me and made me realise I am OK being on my own'

She added: 'I still do believe in love unfortunately, sometimes I wish there was a pill I could take to stop me being a hopeless romantic.' 

According to the TOWIE sensation, she believes life would be so much easier and far more productive if she didn't keep falling in love.

While Chloe hopes for the best, she revealed that she has come to accept the possibility that she may never get married.       

She added: 'I have accepted that times have changed and that might not happen.'
