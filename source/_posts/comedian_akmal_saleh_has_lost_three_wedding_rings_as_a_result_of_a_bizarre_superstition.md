Australian comedian Akmal Saleh has lost four wedding rings during the course of his marriage to social worker Cate Saleh.

A bizarre practice he picked up during the early stages of his 25-year career as a stand-up comic is to blame for lost wallets, trinkets and jewellery.

'It's just a ritual, a habit, a superstition… I've lost four rings in our marriage, and my wife gets upset,' Akmal, 55, told Daily Mail Australia.

EXCLUSIVE: Stand-up comic Akmal Saleh (pictured) has lost FOUR wedding rings as a result of a bizarre comedy show superstition - and his wife isn't happy

Akmal said he adopted the ritual of removing all items from his person from a comedian he looked up to, who suggested ‘you always have to be light on stage’.

'Before I get onstage, for some reason I have to take everything out of my pockets otherwise it drives me crazy. If I forget, I have to stop the show and take everything out,’ he said.

‘I've lost my wedding ring a few times. I’ve taken it off and put it down and It disappears or I forget to pick it back up,' he said, adding his wife Cate is not happy when it goes missing.

'I have to take it off to perform, and she [wife Cate -left] asks “Do you not want people to know that you're married?"' Akmal's pre-show ritual and superstition involves being free of all personal belongings, including his ring

Where it all began: Akmal said he adopted the ritual of removing all items from his person from a comedian he looked up to, who suggested ‘you always have to be light on stage’

'I'm vague and I have to take it off to perform, and she asks “well why do you have to take it off to perform? Do you not want people to know that you're married?"

'I say "no, they can't even see it". It's just a ritual, a habit, a superstition,' adding that his brain is conditioned now to annoy him if he's performing on stage with his wallet in his pocket or ring on his finger.

'It plays on my mind. The brain is weird.'  

'About 10 months of the year I'd be away [touring]': Akmal joked the recent months at home during COVID-19 had 'put a strain' on their loving relationship

Akmal, who has been married to Cate for more than 10 years, jokes that the recent time at home during COVID-19 has 'put a strain' on their relationship.

'About 10 months of the year I'd be away [touring], this has been the case for most of my marriage. And now I've had to stay home, and it's put a strain on the marriage. My wife is starting to get to know me, and I'm not sure if she likes me,' he laughed.

'I'm not a particularly romantic person, but we have a very good relationship,' Akmal said of his partnership with wife Cate, adding: 'I just didn't grow up in a family that celebrates birthdays and anniversaries.'

'They always walk away disappointed': Akmal said he often avoids parties due to the expectation of 'being funny' in casual settings, and stopped selling his own merchandise after gigs as it was 'excruciating' and 'painful'

Speaking on the assumption that comedians are extroverts and the 'life of the party', Akmal claimed it was definitely not the case for himself, personally. 

He tends not to go to parties because of the expectation of 'being funny' in casual settings, and claims he's even been cornered for 'free comedy' at a communal trough in an airport bathroom.

The comedian also said he stopped selling his own merchandise after comedy gigs, because he found the task 'excruciating' and 'painful'.

He explained: 'You've just got off stage and people are waiting for you to be that guy still, and it's impossible. They always walk away disappointed.'

Akmal was due to perform at Drive-In Entertainment comedy shows in Sydney in July, but the company is in the process of rescheduling the dates.
