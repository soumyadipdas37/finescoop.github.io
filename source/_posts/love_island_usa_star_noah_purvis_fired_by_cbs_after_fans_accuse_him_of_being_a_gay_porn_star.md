Love Island USA star Noah Purvis has been fired by the show's network CBS.

The 24-year-old home healthcare provider from St. Louis, Missouri, was released from the reality TV show after fans noticed striking similarities between Noah and a porn performer name 'Ethan'.

'It has been brought to our attention that cast member Noah Purvis provided false information on his application to LOVE ISLAND, which violates his contestant agreement. He has been removed from the show,' CBS and ITV America told The Sun in a statement on Monday.

As well as being removed from the show, CBS has also removed Noah's bio from their website.

Fans on social media seemed baffled by the sudden casting change, with one writing, 'What happened to Noah??? Did I miss something?'

Another guessed that the reason may have had to do with Noah's past, writing, 'he did gay porn under the name “Ethan” and CBS executive producers removed him from the show silently the minute they found out he had a history of gay porn'.

Some were outraged by the decision, with one user tweeting at the TV network: 'you’re such a hypocrite. You’ve fired him for gay porn past but allow people on island to have sex? Homophobia at finest!'

Another wrote, 'If the show kicked Noah out because of his porn past then Imma be p***ed. Even though I don't know him and don't really care about him. Sex work is still work.'

A spin-off of a British reality series, Love Island airs on CBS five nights a week.
