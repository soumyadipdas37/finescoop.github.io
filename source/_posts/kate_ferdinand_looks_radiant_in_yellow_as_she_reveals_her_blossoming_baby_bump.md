She has been documenting her pregnancy journey. 

And Kate Ferdinand looked radiant as she posed with her husband Rio, 41, who she is expecting her first child with, and his three children on Tuesday.  

The former TOWIE star, 29, was every inch the glowing mum-to-be in a fitted bright yellow midi dress as two of her step-children cradled the blossoming bump.

Quality time: Rio recently enjoyed a sun-drenched trip with his family before school stars again

Meanwhile Rio looked effortlessly cool in a grey t-shirt paired with matching trousers in the Instagram picture captioned: 'Family time'.  

The former reality star highlighted her sun-kissed complexion with a dash of bronzer over her cheekbones and styled her caramel locks in loose beach waves. 

Sweet: Kate also shared another picture to her Instagram from the evening with her arm around Rio, captioned: 'My love'

Snap happy: Rio also shared this picture and wrote: 'Selfie mug #instamood #andwhat'

Kate wrote: 'One last trip before school starts ... the baby seems to like a holiday.'

The latest trip comes after Kate and Rio Ferdinand reportedly splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.

The celebrity couple are said to want extra security at their mansion for their growing family.

Happy news: It's Kate's first child with husband Rio but she is stepmother to his children Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia

They reportedly enlisted the help of a special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, to buy the pair of black German shepherds.

A source told The Sun: 'One is already at their home, and the second will be joining shortly. 

'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!

'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'

It comes after a number of high-profile burglaries at footballers' homes, with Dele Alli and Fabinho among those targeted recently.

Chaperone K9 shared a snap of the new protection dogs on their Instagram, tagging Kate and Rio in the post before they edited it.

They also previously posted a photo of Rio posing with one of the dogs's alongside Kate's chihuahua
