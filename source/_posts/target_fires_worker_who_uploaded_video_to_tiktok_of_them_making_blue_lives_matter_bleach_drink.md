Target has fired an employee who allegedly made a TikTok video of them concocting a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ drink in an in-store Starbucks that was prepared with bleach, ice and what they called the blood of innocent black men’.

The video was made by Van Greyson Heart inside a Target branch in Nora, Indiana, with a song titled ‘All I want for Christmas is a Few Dead Cops’ playing in the background.

In a statement denouncing the employee’s actions, Target called the viral video ‘appalling and unacceptable’, adding that the individual responsible no longer works at the branch.

‘We don’t tolerate this behavior at Target, want all guests to be treated with respect and have terminated the team member who was responsible,’ a spokesperson said. ‘We also have rigorous food safety procedures in place, which this team member egregiously violated with this behavior.’

The video was made by Van Greyson Heart (left) inside a Target branch in Nora, Indiana, with a song titled ‘All I want for Christmas is a Few Dead Cops’ playing in the background.

The TikTok video shows them concocting a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ drink in an in-store Starbucks, that was prepared with bleach, ice and what they called the blood of innocent black men’

In the footage, Greyson, who is not seen on-screen, is heard narrating their special recipe for the beverage they concocted exclusively for supporters of police.

‘Hi guys, I updated my recipe for the Blue Lives Matter drinks,’ Greyson is heard saying in the beginning of the clip.

‘First we’re gonna start with bleach,’ the barista says as they pour more than a cup of blue liquid into a container in the video. ‘All the way to the third line,’ Greyson says.

Greyson then explains that they're going add plenty of ice, ‘because, you know, cops love ice,’ – an apparent allusion to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The barista then puts together another concoction in a blender that includes a blue coloring that’s used for ‘special’ Starbucks drinks.

‘And then we add this special blue ingredient that Starbucks has,’ the barista says. ‘We do have it and yes, we are holding out on you.’

The worker then pours the allegedly poisonous contents over the ice and bleach already in the cup.

‘Pour that right on top. Ahh that beautiful blue color,’ the worker says, before setting the drink on the counter and adding a straw.

‘And even though it has a straw-less lid, we’re going to serve it with a straw because, ya know, [cops] only think about themselves,’ Greyson concludes, bringing the 40 second clip to an end.

Greyson then explains that they're going add plenty of ice, ‘because, you know, cops love ice,’ – an apparent allusion to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Greyson has since made their Twitter account private. In a Facebook post uploaded Sunday, they included a link to the song ‘All I Want for Christmas is More Dead Cops’

The video has since been removed from TikTok following breaches of the app’s community guidelines. The video does, however, continue to be shared widely on Twitter.

Starbucks confirmed it was aware of the video but declined to comment, pointing out that employees who work in Starbucks locations within Target stores are employed by Target.

The Seattle-based coffee chain did however condemn the ‘video and any behavior that threatens violence against others’.

In their statement, Target said their company has ‘rigorous food safety procedures in place, which this team member egregiously violated with this behavior.

‘We’re deeply sorry for this disturbing video,’ the company continued.

The spokesperson went on to say that after talking to the employee, the company determined the drink had not actually been served to a guest.

The company also said that they don’t believe actual bleach was used in the making of the drink, rather a combination of milk, water and coloring.

Target was first alerted to the video after a woman downloaded it from TikTok and uploaded it to Twitter, directing the post to Target.

Greyson has since made their Twitter account private. In a Facebook post uploaded Sunday, they included a link to the song ‘All I Want for Christmas is More Dead Cops’.
