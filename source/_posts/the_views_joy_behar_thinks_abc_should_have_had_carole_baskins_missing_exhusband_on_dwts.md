It seems The View co-host Joy Behar missed the part of Netflix's docuseries Tiger King where it's claimed Carole Baskin may have murdered her former husband Don Lewis.

On Tuesday's episode of the ABC daytime show, Behar suggested that the network could have enjoyed a major coup by having Baskin's ex make a surprise appearance on Dancing With The Stars, on which she's a contestant.

Baskin, 59, the founder of Florida's Big Cat Rescue, gained national celebrity following the release of streaming hit Tiger King in which it's alleged she may have fed Lewis' body to tigers. 

Joy Behar on Tuesday's episode of The voice suggested ABC could have struck ratings gold by having Tiger King star Carole Baskin's ex-husband make a surprise appearance on DWTS

Murky: It seems Behar missed the part in the hit Netflix docuseries where it's alleged Baskin was involved in Lewis' disappearance in 1997 and may have fed his body to tigers

While admitting she has 'no idea' what Tiger King is about, Behar shared, according to UsWeekly: 'What they told me this morning is that she's under suspicion and the husband is missing, so what would have been a really big coup for ABC was to have the husband on Dancing With the Stars.' 

'Now that would have been good television. Bring him back!' the 77-year-old veteran TV personality added.

Her co-host Whoopi Goldberg then chimed in, pointing out an obvious flaw in Behar's thinking.

'He's no longer on the planet, Joy. He's no longer with us,' Goldberg, 64, told her.

Ahem: Behar's co-host Whoopi Goldberg pointed out an obvious flaw in Behar's thinking. 'He's no longer on the planet, Joy. He's no longer with us,' Goldberg told her

Milking the theme: Baskin, 59, made her debut on DWTS on Monday night, dancing a Paso Doble to 80s track Eye Of The Tiger with pro partner Pasha Pashkov 

The discussion on The View was sparked by the decision by Lewis' family to run a commercial in Florida during Monday night's episode of DWTS in which they appealed for information regarding their loved one's disappearance in 1997. 

Lewis was declared dead in 2002. 

Baskin has denied having any involvement even though she was accused of murder by her big cat rival Joe Exotic. 

Instead, she branded the Lewis family's TV ad as a 'huge publicity stunt' while appearing on Entertainment Tonight with partner Pasha Pashkov following the DWTS premiere. 

Still seeking answers: Lewis' family is offering a $100,000 reward for information about his disappearance and ran a TV commercial in Florida during Monday's dancing With The Stars

Big cat drama: Lewis was legally declared dead in 2002 and in Tiger King, Baskin's rival Joe Exotic claimed she had been involved in his disappearance. Joe is serving a 22-year sentence for a murder-for-hire plot targeting Baskin

Lewis' daughters are offering a $100,000 reward for information about his disappearance a day before he was due to leave on a trip to Costa Rica in 1997. 

In Tiger King, Joe Exotic, who is serving a 22-year sentence for a murder-for-hire plot targeting Baskin, claimed she may have fed Lewis' body to tigers. 

For her high-profile turn on Dancing With The Stars, Baskin is paired with dance pro Pasha Pashkov but the pair didn't fare too well in the season premiere Monday.

They scored just 11 out of a possible 30 points for their Paso Doble danced to 80s track Eye of the Tiger. 

Next week Dancing With The Stars will air its first elimination. In lieu of its regular Monday slot, the show will air Tuesday at 8 p.m. on ABC.
