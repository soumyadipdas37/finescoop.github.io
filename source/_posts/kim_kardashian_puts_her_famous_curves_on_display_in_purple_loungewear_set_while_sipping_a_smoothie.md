Kim Kardashian is having a chill Labor Day weekend as she prepares for the launch of her new bodywear on September 10th to celebrate SKIMS one year anniversary.

The social media queen, 39, took to her Instagram on Sunday morning to give her 188M followers a look at her lilac loungewear set as she enjoyed a matching smoothie. 

The mother of four posed on a chair in her picturesque backyard as she put her famous curves on display while coyly looking into the camera.

She captioned the series of images 'Match made in heaven' with two purple hearts as she seductively sipped on her purple smoothie.

The cotton ribbed tank and thermal leggings in color 'iris mica' are currently waitlisted. 

In her first snap Kim could be seen leaning back with her right foot popped as she enjoyed her refreshing beverage.

For the second snap Kim sat perched on her knees as she showed off her tiny waist and a hint of her toned stomach.

She wore her famous locks down and long, showcasing a french manicure and a light smokey eye. 

This week Kim has continued to tease her upcoming Solutionwear launch on both her personal social media and the SKIMS Instagram as she poses in the various products. 

The bodysuits, some of which are being restocked and some being launched in new colors, are intended to be a special one-year of SKIMS anniversary treat.

Solutionwear™: KKW has trademarked Solutionwear™ as she uses it as the overarching term to describe her line of body shaping products 

With SKIMS hitting its one year mark, the entrepreneur is now looking to add homeware to the KKW empire as it was reported by TMZ that her team had filed to trademark 'KKW Home' this weekend.

The line will reportedly include everything from scented-candles to bath mats to wastebaskets to drapes as the beauty continues to expand into a new market.  

Though business is always booming for the  KKW beauty mogul, she has also been  spending time in Los Angeles with her four children North, 7, Saint, 4, Chicago, 2, and Psalm, 1, while husband rapper Kanye West continues his presidential bid.

Presidential bid: Kanye West reportedly just spent $6M of his own money as he continues his efforts to get on state ballots across the country in advance of the November election

West who notoriously had a public episode on Twitter back in July, reportedly just spent $6M of his own money to continue his efforts to run for president and get on state ballots across the country. 

The rapper's mental health struggles were brought to light at he launched into a bizarre tirade of now deleted Tweets where he called he likened his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un among other things. 

Days later he made headlines again while at his first Presidential rally in South Carolina. The rapper revealed his wife Kim had thought about aborting their first daughter North as he broke down in tears fresh off his social media spiral. He later apologized to Kim publically.

Though it seems the couple have made strides to get past their issues, the public nature of Kanye's outbursts is no doubt a tough thing to cope with. 

The KKW Beauty founder and Kanye have been splitting time in quarantine between their Los Angeles megamansion, their ranch in Wyoming and a Malibu beach house with their children. 

The Billionaire power couple also recently purchased an undeveloped lot in the coveted La Quinta Madison Club in Palm Desert for a reported $6.8M dollars.
