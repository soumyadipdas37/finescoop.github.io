While he preferred to keep coy about his new romance, the retired Australian cricketer did reveal that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.

Michael went on to add that if negative attention is directed at his daughter or partner, it always hits him 'much harder' than if it were something 'thrown' at him.

The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

It is understood there was no third party involved in their shock split.
