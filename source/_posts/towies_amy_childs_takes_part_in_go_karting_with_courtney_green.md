On Sunday's upcoming episode, Amy's cousin Harry Derbidge causes trouble after picking both her and best friend Demi Sims as his Maids of Honour. 

The reality star, 26, is set to tie the knot with fiancé Dean Rowland, but drama arises when he begins to plan his dream wedding with the pair and Georgia Kousoulou. 

In an teaser, Demi, 23, says: 'Basically, for Harry's wedding, me and Amy, are both maids of honours.

'So how's this going to work out, are me and you going to have to organise everything together or separately?' 

Toned: Chloe Meadows showcased her taut midsection in a long-sleeved crop top and matching running tights

Edgy: Highlighting her slender figure, a chain waistbelt served as a key element of her look

Vanity: Sporting a padded suit, Amy ensured she touched up on her make-up while looking in a mirror

Prepared: Similar to her fellow reality star, Courtney ensured she had a hair brush to hand to maintain her stunning appearance

Watch her go: Former barmaid Chloe was in her element as she cruised across the course

Catching up: The girls engaged in a socially-distanced chat from their karts

She responds: 'Right, listen, me and Demi maid of honours, lovely, happy, can't wait for it. But me and Harry, we're like best friends, we're cousins. I need to be head maid of honour, I think so.'

Demi interjects: 'I know you are Harry's cousin, but I am the one that set them up', before her new competitor hits back: 'I know but I'm the one who has known Harry for 26 years.'

Uh oh: On Sunday's upcoming episode, Amy's cousin Harry Derbidge causes trouble after picking both her and best friend Demi Sims as his Maids of Honour
