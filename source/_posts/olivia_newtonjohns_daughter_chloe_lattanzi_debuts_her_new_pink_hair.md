She's the jaw-dropping daughter of Grease icon Olivia Newton-John.

And on Wednesday, Chloe Lattanzi appeared to channel her inner pink lady as she debuted her wild new hair colour on Instagram.

The 34-year-old shared an incredibly busty photo with her 21.4k followers, where she showed off her luscious pastel-coloured locks which gently cascaded down her shoulders.

'Little red dress,' she captioned the snap, which featured the beauty pouting her lips at the camera seductively while ensuring all eyes were on her ample bosom.

While not quite as candyfloss pink, the former blonde's new locks bared a similar resemblance to the iconic pink lady Frenchy in Grease, played by Didi Conn - a sweet nod to the movie which made her mother a household name.

Fans were quick to compliment the starlet on her transformation, with one writing: 'Love your hair color Chloe! Suits you!' while another gushed: 'Nice hair colour! It's a keeper.'

It's been a difficult year for the Oregon-based socialite, who was forced to stay away from her mother Olivia - who lives in California - due to coronavirus restrictions.

But the pair recently reunited, and were together to celebrate Olivia's 72nd birthday on Sunday - with Chloe taking to Instagram to share a sweet tribute to her 'best friend and mother'.

'Mama and god mama. happy bday! I'm stuffed with vegan cake right now and can't breathe. I'm a lucky girl', Chloe wrote underneath a photo of the pair and Olivia's close friend, Nancy Chuda.

The trio marked the occasion by nature watching at Olivia's California residence.

In a separate post shared to Chloe's Instagram, the blonde stunner gushed: 'You are my best friend and I feel so grateful that I get to have you all to myself for your bday!'

'You are my idol mama. My rock and my giggle buddy. Happy birthday gorgeous!! This is the first of many bday posts!' she continued.
