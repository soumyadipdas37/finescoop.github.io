A German man has revealed he drinks seven pints of his own urine every day and claims to ingest some of it through his eyes, nose and ears to stay healthy. 

Sports coach and student Jan Schünemann, 26, from Hamburg, claims the practice guards against illnesses and has helped him cope with depression.

Schünemann drinks between three and seven pints of his urine every day and applies more to his ears using a syringe, uses an eye glass to put it in his eyes and also rubs the liquid on his skin.

Jan - who hasn't revealed what his girlfriend things of the practice - claims that because of his committed regime, he never gets ill, has more energy and only needs between four and seven hours sleep a night.  

German man Jan Schünemann, 26, from Hamburg, revealed he drinks seven pints of his own urine every day and claims to ingest some of it through his eyes, nose and ears

He said: 'It is the perfect medicine for all diseases and viruses. It is the body's own vaccination.

'I have a better quality of life since doing this but it is all about balance - I have to remind myself that I still live in this society.'

Jan added he first became interested in what he called 'urine therapy' - also known by the Hindi term of Shivambu Kalpa - after discovering it online. 

The theory claims the body is self-sustaining and through urine consumption is able to heal itself.

Jan said: 'I discovered Shivambu Kalpa (urine therapy) through the internet and was very open minded about it.

'So I just started and tried it and straight away, the benefits were so amazing that I knew I wanted to continue.

'I was kind of depressed and disconnected from myself and it really helped me to go in and dive deeper into my own consciousness.

'It helped me to explore all of the angles of my mind, the deeper layers of reality, and ideas surrounding hermetic laws, yogic traditions, the self-sustaining body, and the self-healing human vessel.

'Shivambu Kalpa appealed to me because I was always looking for a health remedy that anybody could use.

'It's very natural and accessible for every human being,' he added. 

Jan went on to claim that urine is full of 'everything the body needs', even though experts have said the practice could be harmful.

Urine contains toxins which have been processed by our kidneys and are intended to be expelled from the body. 

'I practice drinking daily and I also ingest urine in my eyes, nose, ears, skin,' he said.

'You definitely become more in tune with yourself. Since doing Shivambu Kalpa, I hardly ever get sick apart from when I binge on rubbish foods - which is normal for anyone. 

'I have a better quality of life since doing this but it is all about balance - I have to remind myself that I still live in this society.

'My consciousness has developed and I barely have to sleep.'

Jan documents his ritual on Instagram and YouTube and hopes that others will follow his course. 

'It doesn't matter what anybody else says or thinks because you are only here for your own experience anyway,' he added. 

'I would love to see a world where everybody has the information of Shivambu Kalpa told from a neutral perspective so they can then decide for themselves if and how they would like to do it.

'We should objectively discuss the benefits of Shivambu Kalpa so every human being has at least some information - they can then choose if it is for them.'    

He said: 'It is the perfect medicine for all diseases and viruses. It is the body's own vaccination'



Urine is made of approximately 95 per cent water and 5 per cent nutrients including calcium and iron. 

Fans of 'urotherapy'- a term used to describe drinking your own pee, include Madonna. 

In 1945, John W. Armstrong, a British naturopath, published a book claiming that drinking urine could cure all major illnesses, however there is no scientific proof of this. 

Health expert Aisling Pigott, dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, says urine contains toxins expelled from the body and kidneys and drinking it could therefore be harmful and cause infection.  

However Shona Wilkinson, head nutritionist at NutriCentre, says urine is not toxic and is sterile as it has been filtered twice – once by the liver and again by the kidneys. 

Followers claim it cures diseases when ingested and acne when used topically due to its 'disinfectant' properties, and it has been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicines.
