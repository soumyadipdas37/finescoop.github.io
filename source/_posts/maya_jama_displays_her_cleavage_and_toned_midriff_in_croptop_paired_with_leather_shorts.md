She is a popular TV presenter known for her effortless style.

And Maya Jama looked sensational as she enjoyed a night out at London's Ivy Chelsea Garden on Monday.

The beauty, 26, displayed her ample cleavage and taut midriff in a tiny strapless black crop-top as she strutted down the street.

The star paired this with edgy leather shorts and highlighted her toned legs with a pair of strappy sandals.

She accessorised with a leather coat and a selection of sparkling gold chains.

Her raven tresses were styled in soft waves while fluttery lashes and rose lipstick accentuated her pretty features,

The outing comes as Maya recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it’s like, "This is this, it’s everybody’s business".'

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heady Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew’s still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn’t down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that’s my one desire.'

 Maya has since been linked to Drake, who reportedly first contacted the TV star in 2018, but she ignored his messages as she was still dating Stormzy at the time.

The God's Plan hitmaker, 33, even provoked Maya's ex Stormzy in a new song where he refers to the TV presenter as a 'sweet one'.

A source said: 'Drake definitely appeared to have a soft spot for Maya and late in 2018 he started following her on Instagram out of the blue. She totally ignored him and didn’t follow him back as she was with Stormzy.

Expected: The outing comes as Maya recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs (pictured in 2017)

'Even when she split with Stormzy it’s not something Maya wanted to pursue and she has left it.'  

Drake's jibe on rapper Headie One’s track Only You Freestyle comes after Stormzy declared that he still 'wholeheartedly' loves Maya earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Stormzy's new romance with Victoria's Secret model Yasmine Holmgren is going from strength to strength as it was revealed last month that the pair enjoyed a secret reunion in London once lockdown ended.
