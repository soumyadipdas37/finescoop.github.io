She's the latest housewife to hang her hat up for good after getting fired from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

And Teddi Mellencamp cleared her mind on a brisk morning jog through her Los Angeles neighborhood.

Teddi showed off her fit frame in a tight black long-sleeved crop top from her All In personal coaching brand.

She wore a pair of dark blue leggings and wrapped a lightweight black sweater just below her waist. 

Teddi made sure to protect herself and others from the ongoing pandemic with a bright pink tie-dyed face mask.

Teddi was recently let go from the show after three seasons, but doesn't seem to harbor any ill-will.

During a Q&A on Instagram Thursday, a fan wrote that 'Bravo got it wrong,' to which Mellencamp denied.  

'I don't think they got it wrong,' she assured her follower. 'I think that when one door closes another door opens and, as cliche as it sounds, it was meant to be'

Another fan asked: 'What's the biggest lesson you learned from your time on RHOBH?' 

'No matter what, I'm going to continue being straight forward and a truth teller ... and whats on my heart,' she said. 'But I think, watching back, I could work on my tone.' 

Teddi's exit from the Bravo show came days after Denise Richards quit after just two seasons, leaving behind Garcelle Beauvais, Denise Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi and Dorit Kemsley.
