But on Thursday, Jenny Brockie announced her long-running career as the host of Insight has officially come to an end.

The TV veteran tweeted to her more than 36,000 followers that she would be stepping back after a break made her realise that she wants to pursue 'other things.'

'Above all I'm grateful to the thousands of people who've trusted me with their stories over so many years. It's been an honour to share the studio with you.'
