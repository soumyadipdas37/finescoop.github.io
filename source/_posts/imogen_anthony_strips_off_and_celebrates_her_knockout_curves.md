She's certainly not backward in coming forward.  

And now Imogen Anthony has sent out a crystal clear message to bodyshamers, letting them know she really couldn't care less what they think.

In footage shared to Instagram on Wednesday, the knockout blonde donned her  skimpiest bikini yet as she addressed the question: 'When they say you've put on weight since covid...'  

It's her cheekiest bikini yet! On Wednesday, Imogen Anthony (pictured) stripped off and celebrated her knockout curves as she rocked out and slammed bodyshamers on Instagram

In her jaw-dropping performance, Imogen can be seen joyfully dancing around her bedroom in a minuscule bikini with fringing, as she shamelessly celebrates her stunning body. 

She kept her makeup palette soft and dewy, as she threw her long luscious locks around to the glorious strains of Joan Jett's classic hit, Bad Reputation.

The heaven-sent stunner captioned the steamy footage, with a hint of sarcasm, writing: 'Ms She's Too Thin now She's Too Big'.

The heaven-sent stunner captioned the steamy footage: 'Ms She's Too Thin now She's Too Big'.

Last month, the gorgeous blonde got a brand new space-themed tattoo and couldn't help but show it off.

She shared a number of photos as well as a video clip to Instagram, giving fans a close-up view of the ink, and flashing her bottom in the process. 

The model posed with her back to the camera, showing off her derrière and covering her bust with her arm.

While she didn't reveal much about the tattoo in the caption, the model and designer said there was a hidden meaning behind the intricate design when she answered a fan's question in the comments.

'Love your Tattoos, Can I ask if they have meaning. Hope it is okay to ask and not intruding,' the fan asked.

'It's okay, it's just a representation of the Universe, Golden Plaque from the Voyager (google search, pretty amazing) nature and animals, mother nature being destroyed, religion, aliens, all that kinda weird stuff,' she answered.

'Also about religion shooting down any ideas of other life in the Universe. I'm weird.'
