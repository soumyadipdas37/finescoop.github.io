NRL star and anti-vaxxer Bryce Cartwright has listed his million-dollar home just days after he was sacked by the Gold Coast Titans.

A 'broken' Cartwright was released from his contract last week, reportedly worth $450,000, with the club saying they had concerns for the second-rower's welfare.

The 25-year-old hadn't played for the Titans since he was dropped in July and relocated to NSW with his wife Shanelle and their two children, Koa and Naia. 

His luxurious three-storey home in Highview Court, in Currumbin in the Gold Coast has since been put on the market via an 'urgent auction'.

The home in Highview Court in Currumbin is three-storeys and comes with a two-car garage

The four-bedroom home, which has views of the ocean as well as the Surfers Paradise skyline, was only built in 2018.

The master-bedroom has its own private balcony as well as floor to ceiling windows, meanwhile the second storey has a seperate courtyard and study.

The Gold Coast home also boasts a pool in the backyard. 

The footy star and his wife reportedly bought the home in 2018 for $1.29million.

Cartwright left the Penrith Panthers to join the Titans ahead of the 2018 season on a $2million four-year deal.

Touted as a future NSW State of Origin prospect following a strong start to his career at Penrith, Cartwright made the move to the Titans to work under ex-coach Garth Brennan. 

Just one week before he was sacked the second-rower said he was struggling to stay motivated.

'The critics don't see what you go through. My knees swell up and I have to get it drained all the time. We get paid good money, but it's not an easy ride,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

Meanwhile, Captain Kevin Proctor said he was worried about his teammate.

'I know he's had some family dramas and he's gone to Sydney to sort some stuff out,' he said. 

'It's disappointing to lose him through this period but hopefully he is OK with his family.' 

The anti-vaxxer made headlines in May when he was granted permission to play despite refusing a mandatory influenza vaccination under the NRL's return-to-play regulations.

The Titans submitted an application for a medical exemption which was granted by Queensland's chief medical officer Jeannette Young.

Cartwright and his wife also sparked controversy last year when they publicly declared they would not vaccinate their young children, unwittingly becoming the face of the anti-vaxxer movement.

Earlier this week he said his family - including his children - had received sickening threats following their views on vaccinations. 

'I don't want to go too much into it but yeah, it involved my children,' he told Nine News.

'I have little things like meditation ... to clear my head and it can be as simple as just going for a swim, staying off my phone and taking the kids the beach.'

The footy star said he hasn't lost his passion for rugby league and has since been working with a sprint trainer to help turn his career around.
