He shot to fame more than four decades ago as the frontman for chart-topping British two-tone ska revival band Madness.

And Suggs, 59, was spotted enjoying some time away from performing with his enduring band on Tuesday, when he enjoyed al fresco drinks with a pal in London.

At one point, the House Of Fun hitmaker was seen wearing his spectacles over his sunglasses as to look at his phone screen as he basked in the late summer heat.

What a sight: Madness star Suggs was seen wearing spectacles over his sunglasses as he scrolled through his phone while drinking with a friend in London on Tuesday

Sporting a blue polo top with matching shorts and a green jacket, the veteran musician stared intently at his smartphone, before his friend also had a glance.

Suggs, real name Graham McPherson, appeared relaxed and happy as he made the most of the late summer sunshine in the English capital.

His outing comes after he and his Madness bandmates were honoured in their native Camden Town In March ,as a tribute slab that recognises their accomplishments was unveiled on the new Music Walk of Fame.

Specs: Rather than remove the shades, the music icon opted to slip the specs over his frames

The band, which saw five of the original seven members at the event, appeared in great spirits as they celebrated the milestone alongside Lynval Golding from The Specials, reggae DJ David Rodigan, actor Nick Moran and rapper Dizzee Rascal.

Suggs beamed as he kneeled down beside the band's slab, which is close to music venue Electric Ballroom nightclub on Camden High Street.

According to the Camden New Journal, Suggs jokingly told the crowd that the band had 'single-handedly turned Camden Town from a s**thole into one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world'. 

And it wasn't only Suggs who spoke but also broadcaster David Rodigan, 69, who lauded the ska group's 'truly phenomenal' influence on the British music industry.

Fun: The star was seen getting animated as the pair indulged in their al fresco beers in the sun

Legendary: Veteran musician Suggs, real name Graham McPherson, was easily recognisable from his legendary band's '80s chart-topping days

He said: 'They are revered in Jamaica because the Jamaicans know that it was Madness who did so much to spread the music that we know as ska and reggae around the world. Their die-hard fans follow them everywhere. 

'If you’ve witnessed a concert from Madness, you’ll know, apart from the sartorial elegance of the band, they are phenomenal musicians. Their energy, commitment and passion is at a level of its own.'

While it is a fantastic honour to receive, Madness aren't the only legendary musical act to be awarded a coveted slab on the pavement between Mornington Crescent and Chalk Farm underground stations.

The Who were the first to be celebrated on the trail in November while Amy Winehouse and Soul II Soul's contributions to British music have also been honoured on the pavement.

Feat: His band Madness have been together for more than 44 years – a huge feat for any band

Beers: The pals enjoyed a few beers as the English capital enjoyed unseasonably warm weather

The band, which was originally a seven-piece, currently features Mike Barson, Mark Bedford, Dan Woodgate, Chris Foreman, Lee Thompson and Suggs.

There have been a number of member changes throughout the years with Chas, who attended the event having original left the band in 1986 before rejoining on and off  between 1992 and 2014.

In January, Suggs revealed that he regretted calling Brexit voters 'small-minded' in their decision to leave the European Union.

The lead singer of the ska band apologised for taking fire at those who voted to leave and added that he understood it was a democratic vote and he had to 'accept that'.

He also revealed that the referendum left himself and his bandmates conflicted over the decision to Leave or Remain. 

Chat: As well as peering at his phone, Suggs was seen chatting away on it for a brief moment

They're having a laugh: The musician buried his face into his hands as he laughed with his pal

He told The Mirror: 'I mean it's funny even in my band there were Brexiters and Remainers, like every family in the country. We had punch-ups about all that.' 

In 2016, the singer, who is a Labour supporter and a staunch remainer, sparked controversy after he criticised voters who aligned themselves with the Leave campaign.

However the singer has since apologised for the comments and admitted that as time went on he began to appreciate the feelings of those in the country.

He added: 'I regret that. I didn't mean that. I mean I just thought it was a kind of a moronic campaign. It didn't have any kind of reality.

'So as time went on I appreciated people's genuine feelings and that it was a democratic vote, and I have to accept that.'
