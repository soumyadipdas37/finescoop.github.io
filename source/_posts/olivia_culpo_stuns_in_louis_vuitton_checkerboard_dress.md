On Sunday she posted a set of relaxed, bikini-clad throwback vacation snaps with boyfriend Christian McCaffrey to ring in the start of the NFL season.

But Olivia Culpo was all business on Monday, getting dressed up in a stunning Louis Vuitton checkerboard dress as she stepped out for a business meeting in Los Angeles.

The 28-year-old model paired the statement dress with a pair of white Balenciaga heels.

The Rhode Island native accessorized with a Bottega Veneta bag and a pair of sunglasses from her Prive Riveaux x Olivia Culpo range.

The I Feel Pretty actress wore her impeccable, straight brunette tresses with a side part as she left her meeting.

Earlier in the day, Culpo had modeled the look on Instagram while posing with her sweet pooch, toy golden doodle Oliver Sprinkles.

Meanwhile, Culpo opened the NFL season in style on Sunday with a gorgeous photoset featuring her boyfriend Christian McCaffrey.

The former Miss Rhode Island shared throwback photos with the 24-year-old running back as they embraced by the beach.

The two frolicked in the clear blue water in a tropical spot, and the photos appeared to have been taken around the same time as similar pictures she released to celebrate the Fourth of July.

'ITS GAME DAY ‼️‼️ lets goooo @christianmccaffrey,' she gushed in the comment as she cheered on her football player boyfriend.

Olivia was dressed in an intriguing bikini featuring a bandeau top and high-waisted bottoms with a sparkling brown texture.

She added an unusual accessory with matching sleevelets and a thick headband to hold back her dark tresses.

Christian wore a simple pair of swim trunks and otherwise showed off his bulging muscles as his girlfriend sat on his lap and they made kissing faces at each other. 

Alas, Olivia's cheering on her boyfriend wasn't enough to help his team clinch a win, and the Carolina Panthers were defeated Sunday afternoon by the Las Vegas Raiders 34–30.

McCaffrey ran 96 yards during the game and scored two of his team's touchdowns.
