She recently landed a singing role in an upcoming Christmas film. 

Yet Caprice was in full holiday mode on Friday as she slipped into a stunning gown to start filming on The Gift in the streets of London.

Wow! Caprice was in full holiday mode on Friday as she slipped into a stunning gown to start filming on The Gift in the streets of London

Caprice seemed to be defying the cold to keep herself a consummate professional as she got to work on her latest project. 

She wore her long blonde locks in bouncy curls, while showcasing her lithe limbs thanks to the scanty style of the stunning gown.   

The stunner boosted her already statuesque height with a pair of sky-high silver heels with a platform front. 

She showed off her ageless complexion with dewy make-up and dazzling silver eyeliner to open her eyes alongside fluttering lashes.

Earlier this month, it was revealed she will take on a singing role in the film for the first time since her lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical. 

A source said: ‘Caprice has landed a leading role in an upcoming Christmas film called The Gift.

'She is really excited but also slightly nervous because she has a singing part. It is the first time she has sang in about 15 years, since her theatre days when she starred as the lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical.

'She actually has a good singing voice! She saw the final script today at a meeting with the director.

'Acting is something she wants to focus more on in the future and Caprice always tells pals that it is a great creative outlet for her.'

Caprice has spent lockdown at her London home with her millionaire husband, Ty Comfort, and six-year-old sons, Jett and Jax.

In June, she was shocked to learn that she tested negative for coronavirus antibodies, despite her family contracting the virus.

Caprice recently enjoyed a family getaway to Ibiza where she was seen showcasing her stunning figure in a collection of bikinis.
