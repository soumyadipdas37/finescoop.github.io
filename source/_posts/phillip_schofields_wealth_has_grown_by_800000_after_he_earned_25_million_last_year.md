Phillip Schofield's wealth has allegedly grown by £800,000.

The This Morning presenter, 58, is said to have seen his earnings grow to £2.5 million last year according to Companies House accounts, after reportedly having £1.7 million the year before.

A report from The Sun on Monday claimed that Phil's recent £1.45million book deal for his autobiography after coming out as gay and his £60,000 venture becoming the face of a gin advent calendar is going to increase this number.

Big money: Phillip Schofield's 'wealth has grown by £800,000 after he earned £2.5 million last year', it was reported on Monday

A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Phillip may be two years off 60, but he’s still a telly powerhouse - and very much in demand.'

Referring to Phil nearing his 60th birthday, the source added: 'He’s ambitious, and quite rightly has no desire to slow down any time soon.'

MailOnline has contacted Phil's representatives for comment. 

Earnings: Phil is said to have seen his earnings grow to £2.5 million last year according to Companies House accounts, after reportedly having £1.7 million the year before

Last year it was reported that Phil and his This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby netted £150,000 for working an extra half an hour each day on This Morning from January. 

Following the cancellation of The Jeremy Kyle Show, ITV revamped their schedule and This Morning's airtime was extended by thirty minutes. 

According to the Daily Mirror, insiders revealed an extra £300,000 had been allocated to pay Holly and Phillip for their extra thirty minutes of hosting.

The presenting duo were previously paid £600,000 a year for their roles on This Morning, after Holly's pay was brought in line with Phillip's in 2017.  

Last month it was claimed the TV presenter saw his Fistral Production company's funds rise by £807,413 in the previous year, according to figures seen by The Sun. 

Phil's Fistral Productions allegedly had a net worth of £2,544,296, broken down into £1,831,526 in cash, £1,247,758 in money owed to the firm, and £534,988 expenses.

After deducting the cost of his bills, the company recorded an impressive worth of £2.5 million at the end of November 2019, according to the publication.

MailOnline contacted Phil and Holly's representatives at the time.
