Macabre new evidence has come to light that one of Russia's most notorious Neo-Nazi leaders was murdered in his cell, his father and lawyer claim.

Officials in Russia say that  Maxim Martsinkevich, nicknamed Tesak - which means  Machete, committed suicide in his cell in a Urals detention centre.

The authorities claim that he committed suicide by asphyxia. The 36-year-old anti-gay ultra-nationalist was found dead last week.

His father Sergey though has highlighted 'disturbing' new details about the death.

He said: 'I examined the body. It really was murder.

'There were traces of torture, two toenails torn off, there was an injection…. Do not believe this was suicide.'

The body was found on the lower bunk in the cell. Sergey claimed that his son's arms had been twisted before death. 

The upper bunk in the cell was daubed with blood and the words 'Tesak died here.'

 Lawyer Ivan Sidorov said that the whole cell was covered in blood.

Yet one of several 'suicide notes' by Martsinkevich said that he could not walk at the time of his death. All of the notes were also dated October 2020. 

Mir Sidorov said: 'So Maxim got up and wandered around?

'Suicides don't do that. They usually hide quietly under the sheet. There are a lot of strange and incomprehensible aspects.' 

A handwriting expert has claimed that one of the notes was in a women's writing. While the time of death on the official certification does not match the original statement by the authorities.

One inconsistency shows that the Neo-Nazi refused breakfast in jail when, by official documents, he was already dead.

Martsinkevich was listed as a criminal leader and an escape risk and was supposed to be monitored every 30 minutes Sergey and Mr Sidorov say.

Yet the CCTV cameras in his cell were not working on the night that he died, they said.

The lawyer added that the prison chief was 'very embarrassed' that gruesome pictures of the corpse showed the Neo-Nazi wearing ear plugs when he died.

He said: 'No explanation has been given.'

Martsinkevich was in transit to Moscow for a court hearing at the time of his death. 

The Neo-Nazi had stated previously that 'If suddenly I slash my veins or hang myself while in transit, know that I was helped. Strongly.'

His family are demanding an independent investigation into the death.

Martsinkevich had been the leader of the extremist group Format 18.

He had also founded the homophobic group Occupy Paedophilia which set out to cure homosexuals. 

This organisation lured gay men to sex meetings with teenage boys. It then filmed attacks on them at the 'meeting' including covering them with urine.

Martsinkevich also faced claims that he outed LGBT teens to their schools, parents and friends which led some to commit suicide.

The thug had fled to Cuba but he was extradited back to Russia.

 He was jailed for ten years for 'banditry and hooliganism' after a vigilante campaign where alleged drugs suppliers were attacked with metal bats, pepper spray and electric shockers.

He had three prior convictions relating to extremism and inciting hatred and ran far-right youth groups and posed with swastikas.

The Russian Investigative Committee has denied he was murdered.

Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the committee, said: 'One can say with confidence that Martsinkevich left suicide notes and committed suicide.

'He had a very serious motive to kill himself.'

She added that he had expected parole in several years but new charges meant he would have stayed in prison much longer.
