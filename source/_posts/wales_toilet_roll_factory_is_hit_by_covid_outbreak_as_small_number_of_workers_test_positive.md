A toilet roll factory has been hit by a Covid-19 outbreak after a 'small number' of workers tested positive.  

The affected workers at the Kimberly-Clark's Coleshill Mill in Flint, north Wales, are recovering at home.

All employees who had worked closely with them are also self-isolating.

Personal care company Kimberly-Clark's brands include Kleenex, Kotex, Scott and Andrex and the Coleshill Mill factory alone employs around 200 workers.

It comes after 2,948 were reported yesterday - 133 of which were in Wales. 

A spokesman said: 'Kimberly-Clark's highest priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees around the world.

'We can confirm that a small number of employees working at our Coleshill Mill at Flint have tested positive for COVID-19 and are recovering well at home.

'All employees working in collaboration with the individuals are self-isolating and being tested for Covid-19.

'In line with our strict company procedures and local health authority guidelines, we are continuing to clean and sanitise the location with a professional supplier, according to the strictest standards.

'We are also keeping employees up to date on our actions and giving them guidance on how they can continue to protect themselves.'

Kimberly-Clark, founded in Wisconsin, USA, 148 years ago, has 42,000 employees worldwide and sells to 172 countries.

The firm's brand name products include Kleenex face tissue, Kotex feminine hygiene products, Cottonelle, Scott and Andrex toilet paper, Wypall utility wipes, KimWipes scientific cleaning wipes and Huggies disposable diapers and baby wipes.

It was last night announced that local lockdowns are to be enforced in parts of Wales from tomorrow after large spikes in coronavirus cases. 

People living in the county borough of Caerphilly will not be allowed to enter or leave the area without a reasonable excuse when the restrictions come into force from 6pm on Tuesday, the Welsh Government said.

Everyone aged over 11 will be required to wear face coverings in shops - marking the first time this will be mandatory in Wales.

As in Scotland, Meetings with other people indoors and extended households will not be allowed, and overnight stays also banned.

There have been 133 new Covid-19 cases in Caerphilly county borough over the past seven days, equivalent to a rate of 55.4 cases per 100,000 population.

This is the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK - and case numbers are expected to rise, the Welsh Government said.

Health minister Vaughan Gething said: 'We have seen a significant rise in cases in Caerphilly borough over a very short space of time, which are linked to holiday travel abroad and people socialising indoors and not following social distancing guidelines. 

Community testing was introduced in Caerphilly at the weekend.

On Saturday, 450 people were tested and 19 had the virus - giving a positivity rate of 4 per cent, which indicates that Covid-19 is circulating in the community.   

Caerphilly Council has already introduced measures such as suspending care home visits, and introducing weekly testing for care home staff, in response to the increase in cases.

Philippa Marsden, leader of Caerphilly Council, said: 'We need to create a break in the cycle of infection we are seeing in Caerphilly borough at the moment and unfortunately that means introducing new, tougher restrictions.

'I would urge everyone living in the area to follow these new measures; to follow the social distancing guidelines and to wash their hands regularly. 

Earlier on Monday, Public Health Wales reported the highest number of positive Covid-19 cases in months and warned of a 'significant' rise in the Caerphilly area.

It said that a further 133 people had tested positive for coronavirus, representing the highest daily figure since June 27, when 140 cases were reported.

There were no further deaths in people with coronavirus, with the total in Wales since the beginning of the pandemic remaining at 1,597.

Numerous schools have been affected by coronavirus since the start of the autumn term, including one class of 21 pupils at a primary school in the Caerphilly area being told to self-isolate for 14 days.

Dr Giri Shankar, of Public Health Wales, appealed to everyone in the Caerphilly area to use a local testing unit at the town's leisure centre if they were experiencing 'even the mildest' of symptoms or feeling 'generally unwell with no explanation'.
