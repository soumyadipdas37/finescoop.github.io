Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has revealed Dele Alli will travel to Macedonia for this week's Europa League tie against Shkendija and that he expects the midfielder to still be at the club when the transfer window shuts.

Alli, who has been left out of the Spurs squad for the last two games, has been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain in recent days.

But he will travel to North Macedonia for the Europa League third-round qualifying clash against Shkendija on Thursday.

Alli was not in Jose Mourinho's squad for games against Lokomotiv Plovdiv and Southampton

After being subbed at half-time during the opening game of the season against Everton, Alli was not in the squad for the games against Lokomotiv Plovdiv or Southampton.

Mourinho said of his inclusion in the squad against Shkendija: 'I always told that he will have his opportunities.

'I always told that it is no problem at all to have him and - like every other player - performances are important.

'He is coming, he has a chance to play and it will be important to play, it will be important for him to perform.'

PSG are confident Alli wants to join the club as talks with Tottenham continue over a 12-month loan deal. 

The arrival of Gareth Bale on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid has also intensified competition for places and forced Alli out of the first team picture.

Mourinho's ruthless decision to not name him in his squad has come as a shock to both Alli and his Spurs team-mates.  

Reports in the Telegraph claim PSG are the favourites to be Alli's next club, though the two sides are only discussing a loan move rather than a permanent deal. 

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is thought to prefer a loan move, in the knowledge that Alli's value has suffered through a combination of poor form and a depressed transfer market. 

PSG have a good relationship with Spurs having sold Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier to the Premier League side in recent years and that could help them to clinch a deal before the transfer deadline on October 5. 

Alli still has four years left on the contract extension he signed back in 2018 and Spurs are hopeful a loan move will help him to recapture his best form.
