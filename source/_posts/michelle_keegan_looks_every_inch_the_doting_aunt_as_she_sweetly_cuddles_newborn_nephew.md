Michelle Keegan looked every inch the doting aunt as she cuddled her newborn nephew in an adorable Instagram snap.

The former Coronation Street star, 33, cosied up to her nephew Brody in the photo shared on Sunday, captioning the sweet image:  'B R O D Y A L L E N … you’re so loved.'

The snap comes shortly after her husband Mark Wright, also 33, shared his own snap with little Brody, who is the son of Michelle's cousin Kate.

Actress Michelle looked content in the snap as she tenderly cradled baby Brody to her chest, while leaning her head close to his. 

The TV star looked radiant as she donned minimal make-up for the occasion, while opting to keep warm in a thick, beige jumper.

Her Instagram followers were quick to comment on the cute image, with former TOWIE star Chloe Lewis writing: 'Suits you. He's so beautiful.' 

On Saturday, Mark shared his own picture with little Brody, with the presenter looking proud as he cradled his new nephew.

And the former TOWIE hunk clearly couldn't get enough as he later posted another image of himself and the new baby.

He penned: 'Another one (wont be the last) just because I cannot cope with this little man.... I must say, he took to uncle Mark like a duck takes to water !! Brody Allen welcome to the world little fella !! Another hammer to join the clan !!'

In June, Michelle revealed her 'frustration' at people constantly questioning why she and husband Mark Wright don't have children, insisting 'nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors'. 

The actress, who has been married to the TOWIE star turned TV presenter for five years, hit out at sexist double standards - admitting queries about when she is going to have a baby do 'bother' her now.

In an interview with the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, she said: 'A few years ago it didn't bother me and I answered the question, but now I think, "I don't need to answer that because nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors". 

'I remember when I finished Our Girl people were like, "Is it because you're going off to have a baby?" 

'Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors': Michelle revealed her 'frustration' at people constantly asking when she's going to have a baby 

'I know for a fact if Mark finished a job, nobody would ask him if he was going to have a baby. It's not fair. It does make me feel frustrated.'  

Michelle and husband Mark have been together since late 2012 when they met while they were both on holiday in Dubai. 

The former TOWIE star popped the question nine months later and the pair married in a lavish ceremony at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk in May 2015.

The couple previously had to conduct a long distance relationship while Michelle worked in South Africa for extended periods for BBC drama Our Girl, and Mark had filming commitments on EXTRA in Los Angeles.

During their time away, the pair were constantly plagued by claims of martial strife, something which Michelle has now blasted as 'ridiculous'.

She explained: 'If you go away for work it's seen as a negative and not a positive. I just don't understand that and find it hard. 

'You're trying to carve yourself a career and people say you shouldn't be doing it because it impacts your marriage. It's ridiculous.'
