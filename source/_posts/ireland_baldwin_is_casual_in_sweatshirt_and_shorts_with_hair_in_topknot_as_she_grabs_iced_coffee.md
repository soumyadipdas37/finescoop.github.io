She has been posing up a storm in skin-baring snaps posted to Instagram during the past week.

But on Thursday, Ireland Baldwin's choice of clothing was more conservative as she headed out to pick up an iced coffee in LA.

The 24-year-old daughter of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger dressed in a pale pink sweatshirt and black shorts as she stopped by a local coffee shop.

A couple of days ago, Ireland posted a selfie to her Instagram which prompted a swift response from her mother.

Oscar-winning actress Kim expressed alarm after her only child showed off a small black heart-shape tattoo inked high on her cheekbone close to her right eye.

'You better not had......that’s all I can say..........,' she wrote in the comments section.

Ireland, a model, later clarified that the image had been temporary, sharing a clip to Instagran Story in which she smudged it and rubbed it away.

Late Thursday afternoon, the celebrity offspring resumed her collection of sexy snaps.

She posting a photo and a short video clip to Instagram in which she showed off her figure in a skintight black workout ensemble of sports bra and leggings.

In one image, she gazes directly into the camera with one arm raised as she places a hand on the back of her slicked back wet hair.

She holds the camera at an angle that shows off her ample cleavage and some of her many permanent tattoos are also visible. 

In the short clip, she is seen dancing and rolling around on a grassy lawn, finishing with cheeky splits with her derriere backing up to the camera.

This past August, Ireland celebrated being six years free from eating disorders anorexia and bulimia.

Back in 2018, she had spoken publicly about her struggles, explaining: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!'

She shared: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.

'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  

Ireland shared her journey in the hope of encouraging others not to suffer in silence and to seek help. 

'Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn’t worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn’t worth it!!' Ireland said. 

'Love yourself!! You are beautiful!! Enjoy your food. Eat ice cream with your friends! Workout and eat healthy to take care of your mind and body but find your healthy balance! Life is too short.'

Big milestone: Last month, she had celebrated being free from eating disorders anorexia and bulimia for six years. She had first spoken about her struggles with food back in 2018
