Julia Louis-Dreyfus played both the Vice President and President on the hit HBO political comedy series Veep for seven seasons. 

So it makes perfect sense that the leading lady and longtime Democratic Party supporter would be the one to announce a virtual Veep reunion as a fundraiser to help the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris presidential ticket win the crucial state of Wisconsin in the November 3 elections. 

'I’m SO excited to announce that we're doing a #VeepReunion on Oct 4 to benefit the Wisconsin Democratic Party,' the 11-time Emmy Award-winner shared on Instagram and Twitter on Saturday.
