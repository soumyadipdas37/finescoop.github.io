They became parents for the first time when they welcomed their bundle of joy last month. 

And Coronation Street star Sam Aston's wife Briony enlisted the help of the couple's baby son Sonny as she enjoyed her daily yoga session on Wednesday. 

The yoga instructor, 25, performed a downward dog as her little one happily rolled around in front of her on the mat.   

Mummy and me: Coronation Street star Sam Aston's wife Briony enlisted the help of the couple's baby son Sonny as she enjoyed her daily yoga session on Wednesday 

Briony slipped into a black spaghetti top and shorts for her morning workout, while twisting her hair back into a practical bun.   

Sonny wore a classic white onesie, already with a full head of his father's fiery red hair.   

Briony wrote alongside the sweet snap: 'I'm so excited to be building my yoga practise back up, pretty much from the basics. 

'As I slowed down during pregnancy my hamstrings, shoulders, spine flexibility and hip mobility especially have all taken a complete back seat, but not now.'

She added: 'I could choose to see my loss in strength and flexibility as a regression, but I choose not to. 

'I see it as a chance to rise into my power, to move into a space of growth I've never been in before. 

'So you probably won't see any crazy arm balances or hollowbacks here just yet, but that's okay, because there is a mama here now and the fire in her belly is coming back.'

The blonde beauty revealed that the birth of their son was 'calm' despite him being born six weeks premature. 

Briony said to her social media followers in August: 'Nothing could have truly prepared me for your entrance into this world; a journey of complete surrender and the most intense surges of energy I have ever felt in my life.

'But I understand now that it had to be this way. How else could my heart come to live outside of my body?'

Sam and Briony tied the knot last year, two years after the couple announced their engagement.
