She is a designer and businesswoman and the chief creative officer of her late brother's fashion empire Versace.

And Donatella Versace cut an elegant figure as she attended Milan Fashion Week in the Italian city on Sunday.

The fashionista, 65, donned a black jacket which she wore over a blue and red shirt and a black pleated skirt.

Adding height to her frame with black boots, Donatella also carried a purple handbag with a green strap.

The businesswoman put safety first with a black face mask while she also sported a pair of sunglasses.

Donatella completed her look for the day by letting her platinum blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders.  

The mother-of-two took on the lead role at Versace following her brother Gianni's assassination in 1997, and she has previously spoken out about the pressure of taking over her brother's successful business.

Although her first collection following his death was a success, the brand started to deteriorate before almost going under in 2004, and Donatella admitted at the time that she experienced 'tear-filled' nights for many years as she was plagued by nightmares. 

Gianni Versace, aged 50, was gunned down on the doorstep of his lavish ocean-front Miami mansion by serial killer Andrew Cunanan on 15 July 1997.

The 27-year-old man had murdered at least four others in a three-month killing spree before turning up at the fashion designer's home.

Cunanan was found dead in a Miami houseboat eight days later, apparently shooting himself with the same gun that killed Versace.

Twenty years on, it is not known whether the murder was planned or carried out at random, and Donatella spoke about the years following his passing as 'hell'.

Revealing that she felt forced to put on a front for the fashion world as well as her staff as she took over the business, she described herself as wearing a 'mask' to hide her insecurity and fear of failure.
