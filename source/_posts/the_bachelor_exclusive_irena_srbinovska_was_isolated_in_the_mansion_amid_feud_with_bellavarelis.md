The Bachelor have teased an explosive falling out between friends and frontrunners Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska this week.  

Marketing manager Bella, 25, will declare her friendship is 'over' with nurse Irena, 31, due to a lack of trust at an upcoming cocktail party.

While the rivalry between the once-wholesome duo reaches a fever pitch, it's believed the bitter feud also forces the ladies in the mansion to 'choose sides'.

This week, the remaining women return to The Bachelor mansion after production was temporarily suspended in March due to the escalating pandemic.

During the 'Love In Lockdown' episodes, it became evident that some contestants had more contact with Bachelor Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert than others.

A source close to Irena told Daily Mail Australia that following her return to the show she was iced out and isolated by the remaining group of women.

'Basically everyone turned their backs on her after her fight with Bella. She didn't really have anyone to talk to,' they said.

The insider claimed Irena leant on intruder Kaitlyn Hoppe for support, but mostly spoke with the show's producers and kept to herself in her room.

Daily Mail Australia understands that Bella forms a new BFF alliance with intruder Bec Cvilikas, who joins the cast after 'Love In Lockdown' ends.

They were recently spotted together this month on a Father's Day picnic with Bella's mother Kim in Sydney. 

Bella told New Idea that the circumstances in the house made it difficult to forge ahead with her friendship with Irena.

'I knew she had a good connection with Locky too. I loved seeing [Irena] come back from her date happy, but seeing her happy made me realise that my connection with Locky may be worse off,' she said. 

Daily Mail Australia had contacted Bella Varelis, Irena Srbinovska and Channel 10 for comment.

Irena is one of the rumoured finalists on The Bachelor, with Sportsbet and TAB both tipping her to win Locky's heart.

Bella Varelis is widely believed to be the heartbroken runner-up.
