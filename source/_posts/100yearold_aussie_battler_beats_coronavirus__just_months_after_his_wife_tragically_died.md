A 100-year-old 'Aussie battler' has miraculously beaten coronavirus, potentially making him the country's oldest survivor. 

Great-grandfather Roy Bartlett, from Melbourne, caught COVID-19 after falling ill with pneumonia earlier this year.  

The diagnosis came just months after he lost his wife of 70 years, Lorna, to cancer in November.

'He’s definitely a true Aussie battler,' Mr Bartlett's granddaughter Lauren Penrose told 7NEWS.

'Always surprises us and always beats the odds.' 

The centenarian spent his 100 birthday on June 27 at St Vincent's private hospital, where he celebrated with nurses and enjoyed cake. 

He finally left this week after spending 42 days in hospital, the Herald Sun reports. 

Ms Penrose said her family will be forever grateful to the staff that cared for him. 

'They may be someone’s grandfather, and they maybe 100 years old, but they’re part of someone’s family, and they’ve got loved ones and they really truly do matter,' she said.

Mr Bartlett's return home comes days after two other Melbourne seniors defeated the virus. 

Vic Cornell, 95, and his partner Jean Schofield, 87, were released on Monday after successfully fighting off the illness following a ten-week stint in Healesville & District Hospital.
