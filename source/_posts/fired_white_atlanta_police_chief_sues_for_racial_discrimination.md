A fired white Atlanta police chief is suing for racial discrimination, claiming he was axed because the city wanted to hire a black officer.

Former Forest Park chief Dwayne Hobbs, a 45-year veteran of the force, was shown the door in 2018 over allegations of racial profiling, snooping on city council members and mismanaging the department.

Hobbs, in a suit filed at the US District Court in Atlanta on Tuesday, claims that the real reason was because the city wanted to hire a black chief.

Mayor Angelyne Butler told The Atlanta Journal Constitution on Wednesday that 'the allegation is an absolute, complete and utter farce.'

Former Forest Park chief Dwayne Hobbs, a 45-year veteran of the force, was shown the door in 2018 over allegations of racial profiling, snooping on city council members and mismanaging the department

As noted in Hobbs's suit, Nathaniel Clark, a black man, was hired as his replacement in May 2019.

The suit adds that another eight white colleagues of Hobbs were fired and noted the renaming of two city buildings named after white people.

Hobbs was fired by the city council in a 3-2 vote on the night that he believed he was to be awarded a generous retirement package, including a firearms training facility named after him, 24 months' pay and a party with colleagues.

But council members Dabouze Antoine, Latresa Akins-Wells and Kimberly James voted to fire the chief.

'We never said we wanted a black chief,' Akins-Wells told the AJC. 'We did a national search so we didn't know what color they would be. We just knew it was time for a change.'

After he was removed an investigation was carried out into Hobbs's running of the force.

In October last year, city officials stated that the police VIPER Squad had been deployed to tail and photograph council members Akins-Wells and Antoine, rifling through their garbage and setting up cameras outside their homes. 

Council member Latresa Akins-Wells, who voted to fire Hobbs, had been investigated by the police department's VIPER Squad. The new chief found no evidence to support the probe

Council member Dabouze Antoine was also investigated by the police department and he voted to fire Hobbs

The since disbanded police unit had been probing the council members on suspicion of voter fraud and drug activities. 

New chief Clark said no evidence was ever found to support the investigation.

Cheryl Synamon Baldwin of the Clayton County NAACP chapter said she'd spoken with some of the 20,000 residents of the majority black city south of central Atlanta who said that they had witnessed racial profiling by the police.

Baldwin defended the city council's decision, telling AJC: 'It wasn't that they wanted a black police chief … They wanted a police chief who was fair and honest.'
