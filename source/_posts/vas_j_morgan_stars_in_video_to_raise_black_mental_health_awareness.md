Vas created the powerful campaign to help those dealing with trauma, racism or mental health related issues.  

Talking about what the campaign means to him in a passionate statement, the star shared: 'Like so many black people, my mental health has been deeply impacted by events this year. 

'For me, they have brought back a lot of traumatic memories of low self-esteem and self-hate, essentially being told that black was wrong.

Raising awareness: Fleur East also got involved in a bid to raise awareness of mental health 

'If I was feeling this way, I knew many others within the black community would be feeling exactly the same too. 

'I've been fortunate to have received extensive treatment for my own mental battles in the past but know many aren't so lucky.

'This is why I wanted to launch this campaign, to show people that they are enough and provide them with the vital support they need.'
