Netflix dropped another chilling trailer for the supernatural horror drama series The Haunting Of Bly Manor, which is the second installment in the Haunting anthology.

While the upcoming new nine-episodes come on the heels of Mike Flanagan's The Haunting Of Hill House, with some of the same cast members and creative team returning, the stories of the two seasons are not connected.

The new series, loosely based on the 1898 horror novella The Turn Of The Screw by Henry James, is set in 1980's England.

Creep fest: Victoria Pedretti is back for the second installment in the Haunting anthology

Victoria Pedretti, who portrayed the older version of Nell Crain in Hill House, is back in the lead role of Dani Clayton, an American nanny looking after orphaned children Miles and Flora Wingrave (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Amelie Bea Smith).  

Henry Wingrave (Henry Thomas) hires Dani (Pedretti) to care for his orphaned niece and nephew, following the death of their caretaker (Tahirah Sharif), who died on the grounds of their family manor in the town of Bly.

The children reside at Bly Manor with the estate's chef Owen (Rahul Kohli), groundskeeper Jamie (Amelia Eve) and housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (T'Nia Miller).

But all is not as it seems at the manor, as centuries of dark secrets of love and loss are waiting to be unearthed in this chilling gothic romance.  

With suspenseful music lurking, the new teaser begins with images of young Flora standing near a pond and then playing in her bedroom.

As the music grows more intense, Flora walks down a dark hallway in the manor and proceeds to put a mask on someone, or something.   

'There you are. Now let's come up with a story,' she says as the screen fades to black.

The focus turns to Dani as she tries to comfort the orphaned children about the loss of their parents with a slowed-down and somber instrumental version of Motley Crüe’s classic song Home Sweet Home playing.

'I know what loss is. Your parents loved you so, so much,' she could be heard saying in a voice-over before adding, 'In a way they'll always be here.'

After a number of creepy and dark images, a startled-looking Mrs. Grose confesses: 'It's going to sound strange, but I'm having somebody else's dream... the dead.'

A montage of frightening supernatural activity follows that culminates with one of the male characters stating: 'The people here... they're born here... they die here.'

For the final image, Dani goes from stoic to startled when she feels a pair of hands touch her waist as she cleans dishes in the kitchen. Those hands disappear when the music reaches a crescendo and the clip quickly changes to show four others, including the children, seemingly preparing a meal at the kitchen table.

The Haunting Of Bly Manor, which also stars Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Kate Siegel, will premiere on Netflix on October 9, 2020.
