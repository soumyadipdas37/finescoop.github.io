Wearing her luxurious hair down, Vanessa slung on a cross-body fanny pack and wore a dark green mask that matched her dress.

The High School Musical alumna added a dash of sparkle with some jewelry and wore a highlighter yellow shade of nail polish.

She went viral this Monday after she put her knockout legs on display this Monday while dancing on Tik Tok with GG.

Smoldering sensation: Nicole is pictured in the 2001 movie, which was directed by Baz Luhrmann and earned her a best actress Oscar nomination

Moulin Rouge was helmed by Baz Luhrmann who is directing an upcoming biopic of Elvis Presley starring Vanessa's ex-boyfriend Austin Butler.

Vanessa was still with Austin when he landed the role and she gushed on Live With Kelly And Ryan last August that she was 'so excited that this is happening for him.'

Elvis' manager 'the Colonel' is played by Tom Hanks, who along with his wife Rita Wilson caught COVID-19 while in Australia for the shoot. They have both recovered.
