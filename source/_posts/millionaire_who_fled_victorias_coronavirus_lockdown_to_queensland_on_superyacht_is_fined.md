A millionaire construction tycoon who escaped Victoria's coronavirus lockdown by sailing to Queensland on a luxury superyacht has been fined by police. 

Mark Simonds and his entourage embarked on a 15-day sailing trip up Australia's east coast on his 30-metre long superyacht, Lady Pamela. 

The vessel docked at six stops along the coast before it arrived at its final destination at Gold Coast Marina on August 25.

The multimillionaire and six others on board were not allowed to disembark until they were tested for coronavirus by Queensland Health medical staff.

On the same day, NSW Police launched an investigation into the movements of the vessel while it was in NSW waters. 

Inquiries found the travellers illegally disembarked the superyacht in NSW on three occasions - at Eden on August 12, Port Stephens on August 16 and Yamba on August 21. 

On Friday, NSW Police issued nine penalty infringement notices to six of the people on board the yacht. 

'Nine Penalty Infringement Notices have been issued after crew members and passengers on board a vessel travelling along the NSW coast from Victoria disembarked onto NSW soil, contrary to current Public Health Orders,' a statement read. 

The 64-year-old skipper was fined $3,000 and the 61-year-old owner of the vessel was hit with a $2,000 penalty.

Three passengers, aged 51, 20 and 18, were fined $1,000 as well as a 40-year-old crew member. 

The vessel docked at six stops along the coast before it arrived at its final destination at Gold Coast Marina on August 25

The vessel was initially granted an exemption to carry out routine maintenance and repairs when it arrived on the Gold Coast but that was later revoked. 

Mr Simonds' wife Cheryl, their son, and Hannah Fox, daughter of Linfox executive chairman Peter Fox were among the six other passengers and crew.

The Simonds family has a Gold Coast property, while Ms Fox's family is currently renting a home in nearby Palm Beach.

Victorian and NSW residents are currently banned from entering Queensland as both states have been declared virus hotspots. 

Earlier on Friday, the skipper was handed a court notice by Queensland Police. 

Police allege he breached the Public Health Act by providing false information to an emergency officer. 

The 64-year-old is due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on September 11.
