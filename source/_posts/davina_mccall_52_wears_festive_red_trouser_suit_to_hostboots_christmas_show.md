The outing comes after Davina talked about feeling confident sexually, saying that 'women over 50 can still enjoy orgasms.'

She told Women's Health: 'I don't look as good naked as I did in my twenties. But I feel better, and that's the difference.

'I walk around like a foxy minx now because I feel like a foxy minx. Women over 50 feel sexy, we can dress sexily and we can wear underwear and we still enjoy orgasms...
