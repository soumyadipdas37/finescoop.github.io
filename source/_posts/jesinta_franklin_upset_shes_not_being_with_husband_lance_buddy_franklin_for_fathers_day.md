Jesinta Franklin has spoken out about the pain of being away from her husband Lance 'Buddy' Franklin during his milestone first Father's Day.

The former Miss Universe Australia is temporarily staying with her parents on the Gold Coast with her six-month-old daughter Tallulah, who she shares with Lance, while the football superstar is living at an AFL hub in Queensland.

On Sunday morning, the model, 29, shared a throwback snap of Sydney Swans star Lance pushing along their bundle of joy's pram while emotionally confessing that she was 'sad they couldn't be together'.

'Sad we can't be with you!' Jesinta Franklin, 29, has spoken out about the pain of being away from her husband Lance 'Buddy' Franklin during his milestone first Father's Day.

Jesinta captioned the image: 'Happy 1st Father's Day @buddy_franklin23 . So sad we can't be with you today, we are sending lots of virtual cuddles via FaceTime.

'Big love to all the other families who can't be together today x,' she added.

Jesinta stayed behind in New South Wales for work commitments.

This comes after Jesinta opened up about the struggles of becoming a mum for the first time.

In an interview with Body + Soul this week, the Australian beauty explained the difficulties she had breastfeeding left her 'wrecked'.

'I was so exhausted, my body was wrecked and, mentally, there were so many tears,' she said.

Separated against their will: Jesinta stayed behind in New South Wales for work commitments. She is now temporarily staying with her parents on the Gold Coast 

'I was encouraged to still pump because I was told that one teaspoon of breast milk a day was better than nothing. I'd torture myself to get even half a teaspoon.'  

Jesinta and Buddy announced they were expecting a child in August last year.

The couple tied the knot back in November 2016 at the lavish yet intimate ceremony at Wildenstein Gardens in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.

Buddy proposed to Jesinta in December 2014 after 14 months of dating.
