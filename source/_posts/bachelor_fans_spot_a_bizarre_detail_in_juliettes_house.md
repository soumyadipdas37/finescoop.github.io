Fans of The Bachelor suspect that some of the contestants were staying in Airbnbs during the show's 'love in lockdown' episodes.

On Thursday's episode, the cast filmed remotely from their homes due to the coronavirus lockdown, which halted on-site production in March.

Viewers noticed that Juliette Herrera's small apartment looked far more modest than many of the other women's homes, despite that the fact that she is a successful stylist and the oldest cast member.

The 34-year-old's humble home was a far cry from the spacious, beautiful houses that many of the other bachelorettes were filming in.

This led viewers to suspect that some of the women may have been staying in Airbnb rentals paid for by the production company.

'Juliette is the only person who seems to have a normal house,' one fan tweeted.

'They must all have been in Airbnbs in Sydney as they may not have been able to return to Sydney so easily a few weeks later,' another added.

Hmm! 'Juliette is the only person who seems to have a normal house,' tweeted one viewer

'Love Locky’s "apartment" aka Airbnb,' joked one fan, while another added: 'I wish I had been doing lockdown in a fancy Airbnb!'

Airbnbs are often used in reality TV, with many of the cast members from Married At First Sight renting them during their homestay visits. 

The Bachelor mansion was evacuated due to the COVID-19 crisis in mid-March. 

This week's episodes showed Locky Gilbert and his remaining ladies heading home and processing the news in self-isolation.

'They must all have been in Airbnbs in Sydney as they may not have been able to return to Sydney so easily a few weeks later,' tweeted one viewer

'I wish I had been doing lockdown in a fancy Airbnb!' joked another

Although the handsome hunk's journey continued on Thursday, Locky now had to vet the women vying for his heart via video calls on Zoom.

During the show, fans flocked to Twitter to question the point of the virtual episode, with many noticing most of the cast were filmed so well that they may have had some help from crew members.

'Top quality filming. Did each girl take a camera man home with them????' tweeted one viewer.

'Lol iso with a camera crew and producer,' added another.

 It's unclear if the women really did have crew members in their homes, or if they were simply filming themselves and receiving instructions via phone and video.
