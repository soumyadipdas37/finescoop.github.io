Reese Witherspoon has always stayed true to her southern roots, despite being one of Hollywood's biggest stars.

And these new aerial photos of the actress' Malibu farmhouse show how she's created her very own country paradise on America's West Coast.

Unlike most A-listers based in Tinseltown, Reese, 44, has opted for an extremely rustic theme at the beautiful compound, which she purchased last year for $6.25 million.

The Nashville-born Oscar winner and her husband of nine years, talent agent Jim Toth, 50, have spent most of lockdown at the property with their son Tennessee, 7, plus Reese's two other children: Deacon, 16, and daughter Ava, 21, whose father is her ex-spouse Ryan Phillippe.

DailyMail.com's new photos – the first up close look at the estate so far – illustrate a truly glorious setting, with one notably eye-catching highlight being a vine-draped block of horse stables complete with its own pro-standard equestrian dressage ring.

Reese, 44, has opted for an extremely rustic theme at the beautiful compound, which she purchased last year for $6.25 million. The property sits on two acres of land in the upscale Malibu section of California 

The Nashville-born Oscar winner's home is complete with horse stables which also have its own pro-standard equestrian dressage ring and  a small trampoline on the property 

The property holds several chicken coops that no doubt provide the family with fresh eggs. 'She'll always be a Southern girl at heart, so it's no surprise at all that she's made it such a big theme at the farmhouse,' an insider tells DailyMail.com

A retro airstream caravan can be seen at the corner of the yard, though it's unclear what Reese and her family use it for. She previously sold off her longtime residence in Pacific Palisades and purchased another Tudor-style residence in Brentwood for $11.9 million

The two-acre compound is a perfect location for Reese to entertain, with ample seating, swings, sun loungers and a vine-covered picnic area.

Hammocks, swings and a picturesque fire pit adorn the property, plus there's plenty of kid-friendly entertainment including a trampoline, European-style bowling area and a horseshoe game.

Inside the main farmhouse, which was built in 1949, Reese and her family have their own designer kitchen, plus several bedrooms and a pair of vintage-themed bathrooms – no doubt appealing to the actress, who's known for her love of tasteful décor.

There's a separate deluxe barn or guesthouse fitted with its own kitchen, art studio or yoga center, as well as screening room fitted with a wet bar.

Lounge chairs are seen on the property so the couple and their three children can soak up the Malibu sunshine without leaving their home during the lockdown. However, the couple have been seen out and about on runs and walks

A woven swing hangs from a tree at the property. It's a perfect place for the actress to relax and read a book for her famous 'Reese's Book Club'. She's known for turning those books into television shows with her production company

Reese's husband Jim Toth, 50, was spotted flaunting his impressive abs as he went on a shirtless run in Malibu. The handsome talent agent, who has been married to Oscar-winner Reese since 2011, checked his heart rate with an Apple watch and wore a headset and wrap-around sunglasses

The property was originally designed by Scott and Amie Yancey, who found fame in TV reality show Flipping Las Vegas, and it also served as a wedding venue.

Despite her starring roles in a string of movies like Walk The Line, Sweet Home Alabama and Legally Blonde, Reese has gained a growing reputation for being astute in other areas of business.

She has a net worth of $240million, according to Forbes, who placed her at 77th on a list of America's richest self-made women.

Her Hello Sunshine production company is in high demand, plus she has also enjoyed great success with a book club bearing the same name and a Southern-themed clothing company called Draper James.

But she has faced some criticism for her entrepreneurial pursuits, famously coming under fire in June after pocketing $6million from her husband's streaming service company Quibi – right when staff were being laid off.

That same month Reese was revealed to have purchased another luxury home down in the upscale LA community of Brentwood, spending $11.9million a lavish Tudor-style property.

It came soon after she'd sold her long-time $17million residence in Pacific Palisades to an all cash buyer.

An insider tells DailyMail.com : 'Reese and Jim have done a lot of real estate business in recent years, but they're at a place now where they're fully settled.

'They can pick and choose the best of both worlds between Malibu and Brentwood, and that suits the family just fine.

'She'll always be a Southern girl at heart, so it's no surprise at all that she's made it such a big theme at the farmhouse.

'Her idea of a perfect day is to get back to nature in the stables, then kick back in the garden and entertain her friends – just like she did growing up in Nashville.'

The actress has previously owned properties in her home state as well as a six-acre residence in Ojai, Calif., where she and Jim tied the knot in 2011 before 120 guests.
