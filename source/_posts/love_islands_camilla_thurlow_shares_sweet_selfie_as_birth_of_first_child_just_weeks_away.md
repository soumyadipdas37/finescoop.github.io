She's due to become a mother in just a few weeks. 

And on Sunday, Love Island's Camilla Thurlow, 31, shared a sweet snap of herself and boyfriend Jamie Jewitt as they eagerly await the birth of their first child.

The love between the pair was palpable, as Camilla's selfie showed the happy couple curled up together on a comfy orange sofa.

New: Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World - a memoir about finding courage at work and in her personal life. Pictured with Andi Peters

The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.

She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust. 

'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. 

Something for herself: Camilla was approached to go on Love Island at a time when she said she was 'struggling' after returning  from Afghanistan 

'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.

'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'

Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World 

The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.

Exciting time: Camilla has been sharing a steady stream of baby bump pictures on social media and has said she is 'very very happy'
