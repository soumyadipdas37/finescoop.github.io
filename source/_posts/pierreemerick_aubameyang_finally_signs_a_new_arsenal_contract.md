Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has finally put pen to paper on a bumper new Arsenal contract in what is a major boost for manager Mikel Arteta's rebuilding project.

The 31-year-old has signed terms until 2023 worth an initial £250,000-a-week but bonuses included in the contract can take it beyond the £350,000-a-week paid to highest earner Mesut Ozil.

'It's finally done, I am really really happy to be staying here,' Aubameyang said. 'This is my home. It's a great day. I want to become an Arsenal legend and leave a legacy. It's the time to work a lot but for sure I will give my best, as always.'

But Mikel Arteta has convinced his star striker that his long-term future belongs at Arsenal

Arsenal streamed a live video of Aubameyang on the Emirates pitch to confirm the news and the striker face-timed Ian Wright to celebrate.

'Thank you for signing,' Wright said. 'Others have left us in the past but you stayed when we needed you most.' 

Aubameyang joined Arsenal in January 2018 in a £56m move from Borussia Dortmund and has scored a stunning 72 goals in 112 games. 

And since Arteta took over as Arsenal manager in December last year, Aubameyang has been in electrifying form.

He led the Gunners to FA Cup glory which in turn landed them with a place in this season's Europa League. He also scored a stunning goal in Arsenal's Community Shield win over Liverpool and found the net in their victory over Fulham on the opening day of the Premier League.

But at the end of the 2019-20 season, Aubameyang was coy over his long-term Arsenal future and wanted to see an ambitious summer of recruitment with Arteta at the helm.

Speaking after he scored twice in Arsenal's 2-1 FA Cup final victory over Chelsea, he said: 'I'm really not thinking about this. I just want to enjoy this with the guys and take the trophy.' 

But Arteta has indeed overseen a bold summer in north London - Arsenal swooped for Willian on a free transfer from London rivals Chelsea and also signed defender Gabriel Magaljaes from Lille.

Dani Ceballos has also rejoined on a season-long loan from Real Madrid while players such as David Luiz and Bukayo Saka have signed new contracts at Arsenal.

But it is Aubameyang's decision to remain at Arsenal that is the jewel in the crown of Arteta's summer work.

He even teased the announcement on Tuesday morning, tweeting a picture of an hourglass to send Arsenal fans into raptures. 

Arteta's men are next in Premier League action in Saturday's late game against West Ham.
