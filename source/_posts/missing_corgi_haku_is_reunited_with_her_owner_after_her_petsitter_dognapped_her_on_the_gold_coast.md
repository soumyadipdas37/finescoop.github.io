A pet owner has been reunited with her beloved corgi after she claimed it was stolen by an elderly couple she asked to dog-sit for two weeks. 

Carmen Pham, from Labrador on the Gold Coast, asked family friends to look after her four-year-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi 'Haku' while she went overseas. 

But when she returned they refused to hand the dog over, she said. 

After months of emotional appeals, police intervention and the enlistment of a pet detective, Haku was finally returned to his owner's arms on Tuesday afternoon.

Ms Pham was emotional as she embraced her pet for the first time in six months.

She said she has big plans to celebrate the dog's return. 

'I'm so happy. It was her birthday yesterday so we want to do a big party tonight,' she told Nine News.  

Meanwhile the man accused of stealing the dog insists it was a misunderstanding. 

'They said I could keep the dog in the middle of May,' he said. 

'It just got all out of hand... the dog is now handed back- that's it, full stop.'  

Haku was returned to the Surfers Paradise police station and collected by the joyous owner just after 4pm

The pet owner launched an emotional appeal to track down her dog after the couple stopped responding to her messages in July

Haku was returned to the Surfers Paradise police station and collected by the owner just after 4pm. 

A spokesperson for Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia no charges have been laid. 

The pet owner launched an emotional appeal to track down her dog after she said the couple stopped responding to her messages in July.

She went to police and sought assistance through social media to get the dog back. 

Ms Pham posted a plea for her dog's return on the Missing & Stolen Pets QLD Facebook page last Thursday night and it was quickly shared more than 745 times by outraged pet-lovers. 

Kirilly Cull, from the Missing & Stolen Pets QLD Facebook page, said the police had found the person who 'stole Haku'.

'He has now gone into hiding,' she said.

The man who took Haku has repeatedly insisted he did not steal the dog, but thought she had been left with him permanently. 

However Missing & Stolen Pets page administrators wrote on Friday that they had copies of all conversations between the 'persons of interest' and the legal owners as well as a copy of the police report.

'Hand Haku into a vet, pound or police. Keeping an animal that is legally not yours is deemed under Australian law "theft of property",' they wrote, all in capital letters.
