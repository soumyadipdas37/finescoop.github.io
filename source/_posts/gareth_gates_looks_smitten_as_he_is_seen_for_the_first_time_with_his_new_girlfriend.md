He has found love with Ibiza regular DJ Chloe McLennan. 

And Gareth Gates looked smitten as he was seen for the first time with his new girlfriend to celebrate her 30th birthday in Manchester on Monday. 

The Pop Idol runner-up, 36, opted for a casual ensemble of a lilac t-shirt and jeans and put safety first in a black face mask as he left Menagerie Restaurant & Bar.

In July Gareth appeared to confirm his romance with Chloe as he neared the one-year mark of his split from fiancée Faye Brooks.  

Posting a snap to Instagram, he captioned it: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'

He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.

A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. 

'They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'

Indeed, comments materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth commenting 'Mmmmm' under one sexy snap of Chloe's.

In February, Gareth was linked to his panto co-star Hannah Grace Lawson, but this appeared to just be a friendship. 

Posting a snap to Instagram in July, he captioned it: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.' 

The pair starred in Cinderella over the Christmas period at Nottingham's Theatre Royal for five weeks, when Hannah portrayed the leading character, while Gareth played Prince Charming.

Gareth was married to dancer Suzanne Mole from 2008 until 2012, with whom he shares daughter Missy, 10.

He met his Corrie star ex Faye, 32, when they featured in Legally Blonde: The Musical, and went public with their relationship in August 2013.

In September 2018, it was reported Faye and Gareth briefly ended their relationship when the singer's 'very controlling' behaviour led to a series of furious rows.

But by November they decided to give the relationship another try, with Faye pulling out of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! to spend time with him. 

In a move that shocked fans, the singer asked her to marry him while they were on holiday in New York on New Year's Eve.

Previously discussing the reason behind their first break-up, Gareth told OK! magazine: 'There was a lot of strain on our relationship because I was always away with work and Faye's schedule was getting even busier so we decided we needed some breathing space.' 

During the proposal he performed a 17-minute song about their relationship before getting down on one knee to offer Faye a £30,000 engagement ring.

But by mid-July this year Faye reportedly moved out of their shared flat. They announced they had split for good in August. 

The soap star confirmed her new romance with personal trainer Joe Davies in late November as they make their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night.
