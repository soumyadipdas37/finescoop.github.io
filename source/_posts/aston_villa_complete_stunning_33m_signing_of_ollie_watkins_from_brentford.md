Aston Villa have announced the signing of striker Ollie Watkins from Brentford in a deal worth a staggering £33m.

Watkins fired 26 goals for Brentford in the Championship last season and has penned a five-year contract at Villa Park.

The 24-year-old played under Villa boss Dean Smith when he was Brentford boss. 

Aston Villa have announced the signing of striker Ollie Watkins from Brentford 

'Ollie has developed into one of the most sought-after strikers in the country and we are looking forward to seeing him show his great qualities in an Aston Villa shirt,' Smith said.

'He is a hugely determined character who has both the ability and personality to succeed at the highest level.'

Watkins underlined his excitement at working with Smith again, saying: ' I am so excited to join Aston Villa and to reunite with Dean Smith. I cannot wait to wear the famous claret and blue in the Premier League.

'I want to do something special here and score some goals.'
