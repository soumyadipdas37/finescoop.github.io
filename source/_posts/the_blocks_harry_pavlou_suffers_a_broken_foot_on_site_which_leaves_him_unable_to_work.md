The Block's Harry Pavlou suffered an injury on site during Monday's episode of the renovation show, which left him unable to work after breaking his foot.

The 57-year-old IT manager was walking across the building site when he fell and badly injured himself.  

'In my haste and rush to get the room finished, I stood on an uneven piece of ground and I rolled my ankle,' explained Harry, before he was seen suffering a fall just off-camera.

Initially thinking he'd only 'sprained' his ankle, Harry decided to get it checked out by a doctor, after deeming himself 'immobile'.  

But a visit to the doctor revealed Harry had actually broken his foot, and he decided to curl up in bed, feeling sorry for himself.

'If I don't stay off it, the bone could die and I could lose part of my foot,' he told the show's producers.

Host Scott Cam revealed Harry was under 'strict instructions to stay off his foot', with foreman Keith Schleiger stopping by to check in on him.

'Oh, you're in bed, mate,' said a surprised Keith, with Harry telling him he was 'in a bad way'.

Crawling into bed alongside him, Keith asked Harry about his visit to the doctor, with the contestant telling him he had a 'moon boot' and 'crutches'.

'He's out of action, entirely. Except for organising. That's all he can really do,' Keith later explained.

Added foreman Dan Reilly: 'It's no different to the last three or four weeks. Let's be honest, he didn't do too much. 

'He pretty much just organised, so instead of being in the room, he's just doing it in bed... I'm being honest. It's no different from any other week.'
