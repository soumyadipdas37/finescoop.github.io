President Trump's daughter in law Laura Trump campaigned in Florida with House GOP candidate Laura Loomer, who has latched on to numerous conspiracy theories and raised doubts about the survivors of the Parkland shooting.

Laura Trump, who snagged a prominent role speaking at the Republican National Convention as did her husband, Eric, campaigned with Loomer Tuesday in her Palm Beach district.

The district includes Mar-a-Lago, which the president now lists as his permanent residence and where he has filed to vote absentee by mail.

Loomer has called herself a '#proud Islamophobe' and has has promoted conspiracy theories online.

After the Parkland shootings she sent tweet suggesting they were acting, writing: 'Its obvious these kids are reading a screen or notes.'

She beat back five Republican opponents in the primary, and got fundraising help from longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone and Infowars' Alex Jones. But she faces an uphill fight against four-term Democratic Rep. Louis Frenkel.

The Trump campaign tweeted out images of Lara Trump and Loomer campaigning in Boca Raton.

Even as some mainstream Republicans have shunned Loomer, the president congratulated her on her win last month, writing: 'Great going Laura.' 

'You have a great chance against a Pelosi puppet!' Trump told her. 

After Parkland shooting Loomer sent tweet suggesting they were acting, writing: 'Its obvious these kids are reading a screen or notes.' The shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas resulted in the deaths of 17 people and helped spark new student protests and calls for gun control.

Twitter and Facebook banned Loomer in 2018 after her attacks on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who is Muslim. 

'I’m late to the NYPD press conference because I couldn’t find a non Muslim cab or @Uber @lyft driver for over 30 min! This is insanity,' she tweeted in 2017.

Trump also endorsed Marjorie Taylor Greene, who backs QAnon conspiracy theories.
