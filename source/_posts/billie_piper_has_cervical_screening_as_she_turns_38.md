Most recently Billie has been lauded for her portrayal of a former pop singer, I Hate Suzie, on Sky Atlanta. 

The actress plays the titular character Suzie Pickles, who has her life thrown into disarray when intimate photos of her in a compromising position with a man who isn't her husband, are leaked online.  

Earlier this month, she told the Radio Times of tapping into her character: 'I know exactly what that feels like and I’m sure it feeds into my performance. I’m only coming to terms with a lot of it right now.

'In my 20s a lot of my stress from that period was buried, and I still struggle to remember a lot of it. I don’t regret it. I love what I do and where I’m at personally.

'But I certainly wouldn’t want my children to go that way. There’s an anxiety of me as a child that I probably on some levels smother my children with.' 

Billie shares sons Winston, 11, and Eugene, eight, with ex-husband Laurence Fox, and has 19-month-old daughter Tallulah with Johnny Lloyd.
