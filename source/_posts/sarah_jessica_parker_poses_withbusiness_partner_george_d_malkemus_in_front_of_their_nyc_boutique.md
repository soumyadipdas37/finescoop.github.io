Her most famous character was iconically in love with footwear.

And now that Sarah Jessica Parker owns a shoe store all her own, she has no problem getting a step ahead. 

The Sex And The City star, 55, looked chic in a flowy, dark ensemble as she arrived at her flagship SJP boutique in Midtown Manhattan in New York City on Wednesday.

While there SJP also posed in front of the shop on West 54th Street with her business partner George D. Malkemus, who happens is the former president of Manolo Blahnik USA - the brand her character Carrie Bradshaw coveted above all else.

Interestingly, the site of Parker's boutique is on the site of the NYC Manolo Blahnik boutique. 

Sarah looked lovely as she made her way to the site, in a pleated flowy black skirt and matching top. 

True to form, the Hocus Pocus star had on sweet footwear, as well – sparkly dark Mary Janes.

Parker also wore a protective black face mask as protection against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The wife of Matthew Broderick also carried a thin leather purse, which she wore cross-body style with the help of a hot pink shoulder strap.

The actress most known for playing Carrie Bradshaw toted shopping bags from her store, decorated in a fun pattern featuring multicolored heeled pumps.

Once she arrived at the store, Parker tried on several other pairs of shoes, including hot pink pumps, black pumps, and heeled silvery Mary Janes.

For a photo op out front, the Miami Rhapsody actress opted for black heels decorated with silver bows as she stood next to the formally dressed executive Malkemus.

Sarah also switched out her face covering while at the boutique, for a lovely grey mask adorned with a black floral pattern.

The TV and film star relaunched her eponymous SJP line with the first flagship store this past April, with other locations including one in the South Street Seaport area.

Malkemus, meanwhile, ended his partnership with Manolo Blahnik in early 2019, after being associated for 37 years. 

Sarah and husband Matthew, who are parents to three children, have been splitting their time this summer between NYC and The Hamptons out in Long Island.

The acting pair were slated to perform together in the Neil Simon farce Plaza Suite on Broadway this year, but that was of course delayed until at least next year due to the pandemic.
