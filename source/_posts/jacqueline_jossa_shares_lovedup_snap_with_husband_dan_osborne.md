Jacqueline Jossa looked more loved-up than ever as she shared a romantic snap alongside her husband Dan Osborne.

The pair were every inch the happy couple as they wrapped their arms around each other and leaned in close for the photo Jacqueline shared on Instagram.

The EastEnders actress, 27, smiled at the camera while her other half, 29, closed his eyes and rested his head against hers.

The couple appeared to be standing in their back garden and were clearly making the most of the warm weather with Jacqueline sporting a black and white bikini top.

Jacqueline styled her brunette locks into a ponytail and appeared to go makeup free for the snap.

It comes after Jacqueline admitted it was 'hard' to let her little girl Ella go after six months at home, but she knew her daughter was 'ready' for her first day of Year One.

Jacqueline took to Instagram earlier this month to share snaps with Dan and their second daughter Mia, two, as they dropped little Ella off at the school gates.

In a lengthy caption, Jacqueline told fans she struggled to say goodbye to Ella after taking her back to school, but praised her for handling the changes so well after weeks being holed up at home.

After returning from the school Jacqueline shared took to Instagram Stories to add that she was 'so proud' of Ella for handling her first day so well, though she admitted she and Dan had to wipe away a tear as they waved her off.

She candidly said: 'That's the school run done. A little watery-eyed, Mia cried her eyes out.

'Ella was fine, Ella went in she was really good I'm so proud of her, no tears. She was really ready for it really proud of her.

'Me and Dan waved her off and stared through the window for a while Mia had a little cry bless her. I didn't like it I'm not gonna lie, I'm gonna miss her.'

Jacqueline and Dan have had their share of ups and downs with allegations of cheating on Dan's part since they married in 2017.

Dan later admitted he had been unfaithful to Jacqueline and that she had forgiven him for his past indiscretions.

The reality star previously hit out at trolls who criticised his marriage in a foul-mouthed rant after a fan questioned why Jacqueline stays with him.

He wrote: 'Because we love each other, have a beautiful family, I'm a good husband, good dad to our kids, we get on well, laugh together, super attracted to each other…

'Any more reasons you need? You didn't know none of that, eh? That's because you do not f***ing know me, or my wife, or us as a couple lol.

'So concentrate on your own life and you (sic) clearly never been taught to not be rude, especially to people you don't even know. Hope you've learnt something from this.'

The response stemmed from a post Jacqueline shared the previous day of herself and husband Dan, urging him to 'hurry home please' amid his recent Turkey trip.
