A car has ploughed through a barrier and plunged at least 20 metres down a cliff face before landing on the beach below. 

Ambulance crews were called to Bar Beach in Newcastle just after 10.20am on Thursday to treat two elderly patients and a child.

It's believed the car travelled over the corner of a grass car park near Bather's Way lookout before plunging 20 metres below onto rocks and sand.

Shocking photos show the wreckage of the car stuck shallow water on the beach, as two people were taken away by paramedics in stretchers.

It hit several pedestrians on the way but none of them were seriously injured.

Emergency services are going to retrieve the car from the beach because it had started floating away.

A witness said the car had been 'airborne' before hitting the fence.

'I was walking up towards the car park. This white car came straight through the car park. It was airborne and it was not slowing down,' the witness told the Newcastle Herald.

'I heard a bang when it hit the fence. Then it disappeared.'

Police established a crime scene.
