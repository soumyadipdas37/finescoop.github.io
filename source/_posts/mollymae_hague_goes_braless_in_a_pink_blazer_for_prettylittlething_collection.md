'I am so proud of this edit and I have a feeling you guys are going to absolutely LOVE IT! Thank you @prettylittlething for continually making my dreams a reality.....'

Molly-Mae recently revealed it won't be long until she and her beau Tommy Fury, also 21, start a family. 

The media personality was quizzed by fans about her plans to have a baby during an Instagram Q&A, where she told her followers she has always seen herself as a young mum.

When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae, who has been dating Tommy for one year, said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.'

The blonde also answered the question: 'If you could meet Tommy again without the fame, would you?' 

She replied: 'Well this is the nice thing about how we met, we met on Love Island and I didn't know who he was, he didn't know who I was. It was a really natural and nice way of meeting.' 

On how she deals with trolls, the TV star, who claimed she was left fearing for her life during a terrifying boat trip, responded: 'I've learnt to not let anything get to me because in this industry you just can't. It'll break you down.

'So as long as my family's happy and I'm happy and Tommy's happy, then that's all that really matters to me.

'You just become used to it which is disgusting really, but I'm literally a size 8 so if I'm fat and lardy... then you cannot pay any notice to it and I'm quite good at it now.'
