Netflix has delighted fans after releasing a new trailer for its latest romantic comedy series, which stars Lily Collins as an American marketing executive who moves to Paris for work.

Emily in Paris, which airs 2nd October on the streaming service, has already drawn comparisons to Sex and the City, Gossip Girl, and the Devil Wears Prada thanks to the stunning looks sported by Lily in the trailer, which Netflix released this week.

The show stars Lily, 31, as Emily, an ambitious twenty-something marketing executive from Chicago, who unexpectedly lands her dream job in Paris when her company acquires a French luxury marketing company.

But Lily's gorgeous looks including couture little black dresses, designer coats, an array of berets and many mini-skirts has caught the attention of fans.

Once in Paris, Emily  is tasked with revamping the company's social media strategy, but her new life is filled with intoxicating adventures and surprising challenges as she juggles winning over her work colleagues, making friends, and navigating new romances. 

The trailer teases at many classic romcom tropes, including Emily being wooed by many handsome suitors. 

The series is the brainchild of US producer Darren Star, best known for Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place, Sex and the City and Younger, and was filmed in 2019 on location in Paris.

While the wardrobe has been headed up by Patricia Field, who created the famous looks for Sex and the City and The Devil Wears Prada.
