Face masks don't have to mean the end of wearing lipsticks.

If you're looking for a long-lasting, hard-wearing lipstick that won't budge (and won't dry out your lips), then the Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink Longlasting Liquid Lipstick gets top scores across the board. 

The budget beauty buy has had over 13,000 glowing reviews on Amazon, and here's the best part: Amazon is currently offering a whopping 54 per cent off the liquid lipstick, making it an irresistible £4.55.

The Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink Longlasting Liquid Lipstick offers 12 hours wear without slipping, smearing or flaking 

With 13,450 ratings (and counting) the Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink Longlasting Liquid Lipstick has topped the Amazon bestselling list.

Currently the number one bestseller in 'Lipsticks', it's an incredibly popular choice with those looking for a lipstick that does everything luxury formulas do but at a fraction of the price. 

Customers have been raving about the seriously long-lasting colour stay and high pigmentation, even staying put after eating and drinking. 

The liquid lipstick, which has a matte finish, feels relatively lightweight on but is still opaque enough to provide gorgeous, long-lasting colour. 

Shoppers say it's an affordable dupe; the formula rivalling lipsticks with a much higher price tag. It won't budge so you can go about your day without reapplication or mirror check. 

One even described it as a 'superhero lipstick', writing: 'The best lipstick, I have tried premium brand, lots of people have asked where my lipsticks are from when I wear them.'

I work 12-hour shifts, and they stay on, you have to rub it off with a makeup wipe for it to come off it's amazing! It will survive your night out and greasy kebabs after! Superhero lipstick.'

Another agreed, writing: 'Doesn't budge. Believe the hype.' They went on to write 'I can eat and drink and not worry about transfer.....and other things. Also it's perfect with mask wearing!'

There are over 25 shades available to suit every skin tone so whether you want a natural nude or bright red lip, there is plenty of choice 

A third shopper added: 'Really stays on all day! Maybelline Superstay lipsticks are fantastic, they go on smoothly and last throughout the day even after eating or drinking. It's a honestly a great formulation comparable with high end liquid lipsticks.'  

Many shoppers agree that the lipstick is transfer-resistant, so if you're looking for an lipstick you can trust to stay on through a day of work or a evening out, then this is set to become your new staple. 

What's more, the Maybelline Superstay Matte Ink Longlasting Liquid Lipstick comes in a huge array of colours so you can mix and match to suit your mood.

'Best. Lipstick. Ever.' wrote one enthusiastic reviewer 'I've bought these lipsticks in three colours because they're my go-to item for my lips now. It saves the hassle of having to carry around lipstick and refreshing it every few hours. Excellent for beginners in the world of makeup like me.'
