A collection of some of the most significant moments and figures of the Civil Rights movement have been brought to life in newly-colorized images.  

British author and visual historian Jordan J. Lloyd has brought color to more than a dozen black and white pictures which depict pivotal moments in the crucial movement. 

The powerful images show the struggle black people went through during segregation and the many attempts they had to make to get equal rights to things such as pay, jobs and housing.

Some examples in the online gallery include the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, a young boy drinking from a separate water fountain and a black man having to use a different entrance to the white people at a movie theater. 

The collection also features head shots of some of the influential players in the movement, such as Malcolm X Angela Davis and Martin Luther King Jr - who delivered his iconic and empowering 'I Have a Dream' speech standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington.

Jordan has released the high-resolution in full color for free for the public on picture sharing site Unsplash and were shared on BoredPanda.
