Formula One ace Lewis Hamilton has been mocked for saying he will cut his carbon footprint - with a new £80,000 top-of-the-range Mercedes.

The 35-year-old motorist was accused of being out-of-touch after boasting about the electric Mercedes EQS to his 20 million Instagram followers.

Six-time world champion Hamilton bragged he is doing his bit to help the environment, despite driving gas-guzzling F1 cars and jetting around the world. 

He recently gushed over the EQS, which can go from 0 to 60mph in 4.5 seconds, as he preached 'it's important we all take a moment to understand our footprint and the small changes we can make in our everyday lives to put our planet first'. 

But the Instagram post sparked a furious online backlash, with social media users branding Hamilton a 'clown' and pointing out that the flash motor - due to be released next year - will be out of the price range of most people.

Hamilton told his millions of followers: 'Recently I've been making many changes in my life to reduce my impact on the environment.

'The first step in this journey was to understand my personal impact on the planet so I could make changes to improve it.

'Since then, I have offset my carbon footprint from my Formula 1 career dating back to 2007, I have reduced travel where possible, I have gone plant-based and outside of the track, I try to use electric cars wherever possible.

'I also want to use my position as a racing driver to enforce positive and permanent change, which is why I'm working closely with Mercedes to slowly move their fleet of cars towards electric. This is my new dream car, the new EQS fully electric Mercedes. I can't wait until it's released!'

He added: 'It's difficult to always be perfect when we go about our daily lives, but I'm continuing to learn how to be better and I'm committed to staying educated and informed so I can play my part.

'The last step for me will be when I step away from this sport and can focus fully on helping heal the world to provide a better future for our kids and our kids' kids.'

But Instagram users ridiculed Hamilton, a proud vegan, for hailing the fully electric motor, with one account posting: 'Seriously!!! You must have one of the biggest carbon footprints in the world. How can anybody take this seriously.'

Another complained: 'To reduce my impact on the environment I decided to drive the most emitting car on earth for hours every week, in different countries, flying with private jets, with a team using dozens of trucks, selling millions of cars.

'Are you a clown or what?'

One Instagram user commented: 'I guess you didn't have to pay for the car, so it's not much of an effort.' 

'If you want to reduce your carbon-footprint; spend less - thats it, thats all,' another social media user ranted last week.

'Bruh if you cared so much about the environment, you would retire from F1 and you own a Pagani Zonda,' an Instagram user said.

Hamilton has been previously criticised for flying his pet pooches all around the world in a private jet.

The motorist has at least 12 other supercars, including his £880,000 McLaren P1, £1.2million 1966 Shelby Cobra 427, and £865,000 Ferrari LaFerrari.
