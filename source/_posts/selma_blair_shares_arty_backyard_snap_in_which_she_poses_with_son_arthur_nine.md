She's been enjoying her summer, posing in swimsuits for Instagram photos and taking up riding her beloved horse again.

And it's clear Selma Blair has also been treasuring her time with her son Arthur during these past few months.

On Monday, she posted a photo to her Instagram showing the two of them together to mark 'the last of summer'.

Blair, 48, added in the caption: 'I don't think we will forget the long days of 2020.'

The Cruel Intentions star explained: 'The air is especially golden here the last few days. A close encounters of the third kind... kind of cinematography.'

She went on: 'It has been surreal. The fires. Setting sun with son. Golden hour. All day. Sleep well. And good morning.'

Earlier this month, Blair celebrated the milestone of getting back on her horse Mr. Nibbles for a riding session.

In 2018, she revealed she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and as symptoms progressed, it curbed her ability to ride.

But on August 8, she shared excitedly on her Instagram that she'd been able to get back in the saddle for the first time in a long time.

Despite not being able to 'feel my left leg, or where my hips are', she managed to ride a few circuits of the ring and take a few low jumps on the gray.

'Today, we managed to get it together to have a few minutes and I could not stop smiling,' she wrote alongside the snaps.

The actress added: 'We took it slow. I didn’t criticize my equitation too much. I am a mess with MS.

She explained: 'I am going to learn how to use this body, brain and emotions. I am so grateful to have a dear horse and trainer.'

She also recently posted a couple of swimsuit pics taken as she posed by the swimming pool at her LA home.
