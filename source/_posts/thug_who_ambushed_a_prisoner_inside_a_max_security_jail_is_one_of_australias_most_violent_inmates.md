An inmate caught on camera attacking another prisoner is one of Australia's most violent offenders. 

Footage released last week showed the moment a pair of inmates ambushed a man at the Port Phillip Prison in Melbourne's west in 2018.

The carnage is believed to be linked to the violent Prisoners of War gang. 

One of the men involved in the incident has an extensive history of causing trouble behind bars.

He cannot be named for legal reasons.  

Shocking footage captured the moment a pair inmates ambush a prisoner inside a maximum security jail

The prisoner known as 'Ray' has spent years within the system, convicted over armed robbery but notorious for violent jail outbursts, reported the Herald Sun. 

He was said to be involved in the brutal attack six years ago on a feared jail figure and former leader of the Prisoner of War Gang. 

He was also once given more jail time after throwing a television at a prison officer.

'Ray' also endangered inmates and officers after setting fire to his cell. 

His history of drug abuse and weapons offences are also well-known after long stints behind bars over the past decade.

It was only years ago he was convicted over another prison attack.  

The latest assault reportedly involved makeshift knives.

The victim of the attack caught on film was taken away on a stretcher and reportedly needed hundreds of stitches after the ambush

The current leader of the Prisoner of Ware Gang is Matthew Charles Johnson - who was sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for killing Melbourne crime lord Carl Williams inside Barwon Prison. 

The video released last week showed two men wearing white shirts squaring up to the shirtless inmate and trading blows with him on a prison walkway. 

Other prisoners watched on from the dining area below as the topless man initially fought back against his attackers before being backed into a corner and left severely bloodied by a series of blows.  

The victim was taken away on a stretcher and reportedly needed hundreds of stitches after the ambush. 

Port Phillip Prison in Melbourne was the scene of another violent attack earlier this year.

The heavily tattooed inmate was allegedly bashed to death after he fought back when a prison gang demanded he hand over an ornate skull ring. 

Within the past month, two jail staff members have been assaulted when they searched for a missing USB stick and an inmate was repeatedly stabbed in a vicious attack.  

G4S - which privately operates Port Phillip prison - previously declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.
