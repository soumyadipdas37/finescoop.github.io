It was very much a family affair for Sofia Richie on Wednesday as she shared a fun snap with sister Nicole and niece Harlow Madden on Instagram. 

The 21-year-old model posed up a storm as she cosied up to her adoptive sister, 39, and her lookalike daughter, 12, during a family painting session.

Sofia appeared in great spirits as she captioned the snap: 'My favorite trio', before later larking around with her older sibling.

The daughters of music legend Lionel Richie, 71, appeared super close as they knelt down in front of lit-up trees for the nighttime snap.

Sofia cut a casual figure in a white printed T-shirt and jeans for the occasion, while The Simple Life star Nicole glammed up in a strapless red dress.

Meanwhile little Harlow, whom she shares with her Good Charlotte rocker husband Joel Madden, 41, looked pretty in a pink vest top and white joggers. 

Blonde beauty Sofia kept her fans updated with her family's fun-filled evening on her stories, which saw them all take part in an art class at what appeared to be Lionel's Beverly Hills mansion.

She also shared a cute snap in the mirror with pal Tess Kempner and joked they could be 'twins' with their similar outfits.

Last month, Sofia had sparked rumours of romance with Jaden Smith, as they took to the beach for Labor Day weekend. 

Jaden, the son of Will Smith, has since set the record straight, revealing he and Richie are 'just homies' and have been enjoying each other's company as beach buddies for the better part of a decade.

Endless love: Nicole and Sofia are the daughters of music legend Lionel Richie. They also have a brother, Miles, 26

He said on On Air with Ryan Seacrest: 'You know, I actually don't look at the internet, so I didn't see that. 

'But, me and Sofia have been friends for like 10 years. We've been going to the beach pretty consistently for 10 years too. But, yeah, we're just homies and we love each other and it was fun.' 

Jaden and Sofia were previously rumoured to have a brief teen romance, which lasted from 2012 to 2013, when they were both 14.

The model recently split from Scott Disick, 37, 'for good,' after three years of dating.  

The TV star and Sofia ended their turbulent romance earlier this summer, and they are now no longer on speaking terms after 'Scott officially called it off.' 

An E! News insider claimed that their age difference and different lifestyles, as Scott has three children, ultimately became an issue for the celebrity duo.
