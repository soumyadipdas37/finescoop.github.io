Princess Love appeared to suggest it's too late to save her marriage to Ray J when she was spotted out in West Hollywood on Thursday.

The 36-year-old designer was enjoying a girls' night in West Hollywood when she was asked about her estranged husband's comments that he'd be open to getting counselling to save their marriage.

Ray J filed for divorce earlier this month but then admitted in an interview this week that he was doubting his decision.

Princess, clad in a skintight black mini dress, was heading into hotspot Catch when she was stopped by TMZ.

The brunette beauty appeared shocked when she was told that Ray had talked about the possibility of them working things out.

'He said that?' Princess asked, adding, 'He didn't say that to me!'

When asked if she was open to counselling like Ray was, Princess responded it's 'a little too late'. 

Princess and Ray J, who wed in 2016, share eight-month old son Epik Ray and two-year-old daughter Melody Love.

Opening up about his marriage troubles, Ray, 39, told the hosts of The Real in a video chat on Monday, 'When you're in your own relationship, sometimes, you know, sometimes you do things spontaneously, sometimes you move too fast, sometimes you make mistakes, you know what I mean?' 

He added, 'And so ... I'm not saying that that's what I did, or that I made a mistake, but I don't know if I did make a mistake. I don't know.' 

Ray J added: 'I have every right to just not know and still just try to figure it out.'

Host Jeannie Mai confronted the One Wish hitmaker about 'refusing to go to marriage counseling' with Princess and encouraged him to explain his reasoning behind the refusal.

'I just felt like the counseling was more so a hustle and it wasn't good ... I felt like it would get one-sided,' he stated, before suddenly shifting his opinion on the matter. 'But, hey, maybe we do need counseling.'

Ray added that he had been spending lots of time at the house with his family and called what he and Princess have 'a good thing'.

'It was just a good vibe, it really was. I just have to fall back and go, damn, this is a really, really good thing.' 

Of counselling he said, 'I would be up for it. I'd be up for whatever it is to make sure my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7,' 

He continued: 'I don't see myself splitting the time, it's so tough to not be with your kids all of your time.'

With counseling officially on the table, host Loni Love asked Ray J, born William Ray Norwood Jr., to explain 'the problem' with him and Princess Love's relationship.

'Sometimes you move too fast, sometimes you make mistakes,' Ray J told The Real on Monday

Of counselling he said, 'I would be up for it. I'd be up for whatever it is to make sure my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7,'

'It's not about unhappiness, sometimes we don't see eye to eye and it maybe gets too explosive and sometimes we might move too fast. Sometimes we might not move too fast.'

Ray, who enlisted celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser for proceedings, filed for dissolution of marriage in Los Angeles County Court on Monday, September 14. 

In the filing, the I Hit It First singer claimed he and Princess Love had a prenuptial agreement that he wants enforced, which details prior-agreed support and personal property which is not part of the marriage.

Back in May, Princess had filed for divorce from the singer, before seemingly having a change of heart and requesting to dismiss the filing on July 8.

Princess had sought full legal and physical custody of their two kids along with child support.
