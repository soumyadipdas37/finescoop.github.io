'7th day of fall,' Kylie captioned the snap, including a bikini emoji.

Despite the lack of clothing, Kylie still oozed glamour as she sat upon her ultra plush couch.

Kylie's long, highlighted hair cascaded down her chest in mermaid-esque waves, styled away from her perfectly done-up complexion.

She wore a chunky gold bracelet, watch, necklace, and trendy pair of hoop earrings.

Even her long nails were perfectly polished.

The Kylie-approved snap was worlds away from the recent photo her big sister Kim Kardashian recently posted, which showed the reality star as a geeky youngster with bad bangs.

The photo was taken circa 2009, and showed the Kardashian and Jenner sisters posing together at a dinner table.

'Delete this immediately,' Kylie instructed Kim in the comments.

Kim hilarious replied, 'Should I Diddy crop you out?', referencing the rapper's penchant for cropping out celebrities from his photos.

'Absolutely,' Kylie approved.

The photo drew countless comments from fans, who remarked on just how different the women looked in the old photo.

'Lol Kim know she's wrong. She's the only one that looks good,' remarked one Instagram user.

'Kim knows she looks good but her sisters (laughing crying emojis) that's why she posted it,' commented another.

Meanwhile, Kylie's former BFF Jordyn Woods returned to headlines over the weekend after it emerged she had found love with NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns.

Jordyn made their relationship Instagram official on Sunday, posting several loved-up snaps of the new couple cuddling up on the beaches of Cabo San Lucas.

'I found you, then I found me,' Jordyn captioned the photo series.

As KUWTK fans may remember, Jordyn landed at the heart of a cheating scandal last year after it emerged she shared a kiss with Khloe Kardashian's then-boyfriend Tristan Thompson, resulting in the end of their relationship.

The controversy also ended her close friendship with the Kardashian family.  

However, Khloe and Tristan ultimately moved past the transgression, rekindling their romance in recent weeks.
