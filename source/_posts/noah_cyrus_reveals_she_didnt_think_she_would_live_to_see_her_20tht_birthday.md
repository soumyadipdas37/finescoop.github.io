Noah Cyrus opened up about some of her mental health struggles in a moving Instagram post on Monday.

The 20-year-old singer songwriter delved into her history of depression while marking the two-year anniversary of her debut EP Good Cry.

During the depths of her depression when she was 18, the younger sister of Miley Cyrus doubted she would even make it to her 20th birthday.

Noah's lengthy post featured the pink bathed cover of her EP, in which a photo of her was drawn over to add tear drops and comic book–style lines.

'my first ep ‘Good Cry’ came out 2 years ago today. time flies,' she began.

'i’ve been through so much since then. putting this ep out and going on tour during one of the most depressive times in my life was so hard. every day felt like lifting 100lb weights just to get out of bed. the ache in my chest from the pain felt unbearable,' she continued.

The overwhelming depression made her fear that she wouldn't have much of a future.

'at 18 i didn’t think i was going to be here for a 20th birthday soon to be 21. they felt 1000 years away. it seems impossible... i was so sad. so hurt. and so scared.   

Painful times: 'Every day felt like lifting 100lb weights just to get out of bed. the ache in my chest from the pain felt unbearable,' she explained in the lengthy post, which marked the second anniversary of her debut album

Noah went on to thank the friends and fans who supported her during the darkest days of her depression. 

'every day is work when it comes to your mental health and personal battles. not every day is going to be hell and not every day is going to be perfect. i’m still figuring that out,' she continued.

She added that growing up in public provided special challenges to her, and she described having 'many ups and downs' throughout the past two years. 

'this ep means so much to me and always will.. i always have written nothing but the truth and this ep was exactly that. i still stand with needing a good f**kin cry every once in awhile.

'i know that pain is something we HAVE to feel and experience. i owe this album so much. it tought me so much about myself... and looking back at myself then to sho i am now i just want to run back in time and give that Noah a huge a** hug.. as she was breaking ever so slowly,' she wrote.

Noah concluded her note but noting how she turned her pain 'into something beautiful that others can sing, cry, or smile to,' which gave her a sense of purpose.

Earlier this summer, Noah followed up Good Cry with her next EP, The End Of Everything, which was her first release to chart on the Billboard 200. It also reached number one on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart for new and developing artists.

Around that time she appeared on an Instagram Live session to explain how it was 'unbearable' growing up in the shadow of her famous sister Miley, 27.

She particularly responded to one lyric, where she compares her sister to, 'sunshine, bringing good light wherever she’ll go,' while she, 'was born to rain clouds, blessed in her shadows.' 

When speaking out about the lyrics during her Instagram Live session, she opened up about how tough it was to live in Miley's shadow.

'I think just the message in the second verse, being born in the family I was in, everyone gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley’s little sister,' she said.
