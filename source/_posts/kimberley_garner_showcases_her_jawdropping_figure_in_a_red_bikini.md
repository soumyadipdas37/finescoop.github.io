The model showcased her jaw-dropping figure in the snaps as she posed with her dish and a glass of aperol spritz.

Fixing the camera with a sultry stare, Kimberley let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders while she also sported a silver necklace.

Alongside the post, the reality star wrote: '10pm curfew ;)'.  

As she returned from European hot spot St Tropez last month, the model revealed that she tested negative for COVID-19.

Kimberley was able to return to the UK just before the new quarantine restrictions were enforced which requires all tourists to self isolate for two weeks following her trip abroad.

She penned on Instagram: '@kimberleylondon bikini 2 weeks ago in a now closed France. On the last night I decided to not go to a party, so tempting.

'A small gentle voice in my tummy said not to, and I listened. I believe in God, this gentle feeling. I'm the only person back who is COVID-19 negative. Trust that little feeling.'

Earlier this summer, Kimberley was pictured with Made In Chelsea co-star Ollie Chambers, after enjoying a tennis session together.

Although Kimberley recently revealed that she has been having a 'great' time dating, she confirmed to MailOnline in July that her relationship with Ollie is purely platonic.

It came after she revealed she cancelled a secret wedding and ended a long-term relationship last summer.
