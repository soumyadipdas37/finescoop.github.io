Premier League clubs shared £2.55BILLION in prize money and 'central funds' payments last season, with champions Liverpool taking home just over £158million, the Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Runners-up Manchester City (£157m), third-placed Manchester United (£154m) and fourth-placed Chelsea (£153m) also topped £150m each — despite the issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The numbers are sure to inflame the debate about how the top-flight should be helping those struggling lower down the pyramid.

But while Premier League clubs have banked last season's money already, all of them will need to pay back part of it in rebates to broadcasters for last season's disrupted schedule. The sums will range from around £17m to £7m.

If no fans are allowed back in 2020-21, then clubs will lose around £800m in match-day income, collectively, plus tens of millions more from lost merchandising and more still from events like concerts.

Against this backdrop, the EFL is desperate for funding of between £200m to £250m to cover potential losses of that size from its 72 clubs. The Government would be one source of funding, but they want the Premier League to help. Top flight clubs are not averse to that — but want to have fans back first. There are no simple solutions.

The £2.55bn of Premier League cash was split in various ways, detailed in our table. Each club received an 'equal share' of £76m, some from domestic TV deals, some from foreign rights.

Manchester United, meanwhile, received £154million last season after they finished third

Each club received merit money of around £2.6m per place in the table. About £1.74m of each £2.6m in merit money comes from the domestic 'pot' and the balance — in a method first used last season — from the overseas 'pot'. Starting in 2019-20, part of the foreign TV cash was split according to finishing position rather than equally.

Each club also received a 'facility' payment which varied depending on how many games were shown live in the UK. But Covid made this complicated because every game from the restart onwards was shown live, but not all of those counted as 'paid for' games.

Liverpool had 30 games live on TV for example, but only 27 counted as 'paid for'. 'Paid for' was determined by which games Sky and BT would have shown if they screened only those originally contracted.

The final payment to clubs was a sum of around £6m each, comprising 'central commercial income' (from sponsors and suppliers of the league as a whole) and income from live radio contracts.
