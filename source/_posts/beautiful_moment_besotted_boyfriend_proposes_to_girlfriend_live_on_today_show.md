A dad-of-three has taken advantage of his live appearance on national television to propose to his long-term partner in front of their kids.

Rhys Scott appeared on the Today show on Thursday morning and took the traditional approach of getting down on one knee and asking: 'Will you marry me Natasha Leigh?'

The mother to Brooklyn, Harlon and Weston beamed with excitement as she embraced Mr Scott and kissed him.

The couple then hugged as Ms Leigh said 'yes', and the children held a sign in the background saying 'Mummy marry daddy'.

The sweet moment was caught at Sirromet Wines at Mount Cotton, Queensland, while the family was among the on-site guests for the breakfast program's weather forecast.

Weatherman Tim Davies caught up with the couple moments later to clarify how long they had known each other and how soon they would be getting married.

The could have married on the spot - they had a perfect location and she was dressed in white - but Ms Leigh said the wedding would 'need some time' to organise and forecast they would tie the knot in 'maybe a year'.

'Need this one to not be the menace,' she joked about one of her young children who was wriggling all over the place while being interviewed.

The couple met at a Gold Coast night club seven years ago.

Mr Scott told Mr Davies he knew Mr Leigh was the one as soon as he set his sights on her and 'had a lot of work to do'.

In a surprise twist, Ms Leigh (pictured) said she would 'need some time' before confirming the couple would tie the knot in 'maybe a year' - despite being dressed for the occasion on Thursday by wearing white

'He harassed me,' Ms Leigh joked.

In keeping with his traditional approach, Mr Scott had sought the approval of Ms Leigh's dad the night before.

'I almost missed that phone call but got it in time,' he said. 'I had so much on my mind.' 

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to the couple for comment.
