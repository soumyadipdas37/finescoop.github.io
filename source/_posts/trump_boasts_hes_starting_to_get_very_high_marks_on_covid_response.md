President Donald Trump boasted about his handling of the coronavirus crisis Monday morning as the U.S. death toll moved toward the 200,000 mark.  

'Starting to get VERY high marks in our handling of the Coronavirus (China Virus), especially when compared to other countries and areas of the world. Now the Vaccines (Plus) are coming, and fast!' Trump tweeted.  

Polling from this weekend continued to show that Americans believed Democrat Joe Biden could handle the pandemic better than Trump.

Trump tweeted Monday morning that he was 'starting to get VERY high marks' for the administration's handling of the coronavirus crisis, despite polling giving Democrat Joe Biden an edge 

A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll that was released Sunday showed that while voters were split on which candidate would better handle the economy - 44 per cent said Biden and 45 per cent said Trump - Biden was seen as the candidate who could handle the virus the best. 

Among registered voters nationally, 50 per cent said Biden would better handle the coronavirus crisis, versus 38 per cent who said Trump. 

The poll also found that Biden voters were much more concerned about the handling of the coronavirus crisis if Trump won, than Trump voters were concerned about the coronavirus if Biden won. 

Additionally, 50 per cent of registered voters nationally said the Trump administration deserved blame for the country's handling of the pandemic. 

Another 33 per cent believed the Trump administration deserved credit.  

A Harvard CAPS-Harris poll that was released Friday found that 57 per cent of voters believed Biden was the preferred candidate to lead the nation out of the pandemic. 

That's because 58 per cent said that Trump had done a bad job handling the crisis. 

At the same time, 62 per cent of those polled believed individual governors around the nation did a good job handling the pandemic. 

Among the swing category of independents, just 35 per cent said Trump did a good job handling the coronavirus.   

Shortly after his poll boast, the president announced he would be holding a 1 p.m. news conference Monday to talk about the economy. 

'Jobs number, and the Economic comeback, are looking GREAT,' Trump tweeted. 

Trump has largely hidden away the public health officials who used to brief the country alongside Trump and instead used the briefings to tout economic numbers.
