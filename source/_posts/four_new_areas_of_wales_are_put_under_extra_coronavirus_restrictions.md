More than 500,000 people in North Wales will be plunged into a local lockdown amid a spike in infections, the country's health minister announced tonight.

From 6pm on Thursday, residents of Denbighshire, Flintshire, Conwy and Wrexham will be banned from mixing indoors with other households.

People will also not be allowed to enter of leave these areas without a reasonable excuse, such as work or education. 

The recent rise in coronavirus cases has been blamed on people socialising indoors. 

From 6pm on Thursday, residents of Denbighshire, Flintshire, Conwy (it's famous castle is pictured) and Wrexham will be banned from mixing indoors with other households

Health minister Vaughan Gething said: 'Unfortunately, we have seen a rise in coronavirus cases in four north Wales local authority areas – in Denbighshire, Flintshire, Wrexham and Conwy. 

'These are largely linked to people socialising indoors and are the pattern of transmission similar to what we have seen in South Wales.

'We have worked closely with local authority leaders and the police in North Wales and we all agree about the need to take swift action to control and the spread of the virus.

'Large parts of Wales will now be subject to local restrictions but I want to be clear – this is not a national lockdown. These are a series of local restrictions to respond to rises in cases in individual areas.

'It's always difficult to make the decision to impose restrictions but we hope that these measures will make a positive difference – just as we have seen in Caerphilly and Newport, where local residents have pulled together and followed the rules.

'It is important we all work together and support each other. This isn't just about protecting ourselves, it's about protecting each other.'

These rules are in addition to nationwide restrictions such as a 10pm curfew on bars and restaurants and a requirement to wear face coverings in public indoor areas.
