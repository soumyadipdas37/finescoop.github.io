If you're having trouble sleeping at night, a pregnancy support pillow could be just the thing to help - even if you don't have a baby on the way.

Sleeping while pregnant isn't easy, what with the growing bump and physical aches and pains, so anything that can offer both comfort and support should be an essential item. 

The Hometex 9ft U Shaped Comfort Pregnancy Support Pillow is currently the UK's bestselling support pillow. Now available on Amazon for just £16.99, it's proving to be a popular buy with mums-to-be. In fact, it's so comfortable that non-pregnant people with back pain are snapping them up too. 

The Hometex 9ft U Shaped Comfort Pregnancy Support Pillow has been a big hit with mums-to-be and non-pregnant people alike

Not only does the Hometex pillow act as a useful positioning aid by helping to keep you on your side, it also claims to reduce pain, make you more comfortable, and ultimately allow you to get a better night's sleep.

A lot of the glowing reviews highlight the pillow's positive effects on the user's aches and pains. And unlike other inexpensive options, mums-to-be praise the pillow for the support it provides to the hips, back, neck and head. Plus, at £16.99, it's cheap and cheerful choice.

'Heaven in pillow form,' wrote one shopper in their review on Amazon. 'Best thing I have bought in ages, I have struggled with hip, back and neck pain with pregnancy and was getting a couple of hours sleep at best. Now I sleep right through and no pains when I get up, heaven.'

Another added: 'Best pillow ever! I have really bad back pain and struggle to sleep this has been amazing I can put one side between my knees and the other side to wedge behind my back to stop me rolling. It’s also really comforting but it is big!'

The supporting U-Shape cocoons your whole body into a comforting position and even helps to relieve aches and pains 

At 9ft, the pregnancy pillow is definitely oversized, so if you like the feeling of being cocooned, then it is sure to appeal. Plus, as it's so big it supports the whole body including your head, knees, hips and back.  

One shopper commented: 'Shhhh.. Not just for pregnancy...Bought one for the wife when she was pregnant. Secretly used it when she wasn't around {afternoon naps}. Got rumbled.. so decided to get my own. Like sleeping on a cloud.'

Another shopper wrote: 'It helps with my back problem, it also give me a really good night's sleep so you don't have to be pregnant to get one of these. They're are amazing.' 

The pillow isn't just for the weeks leading up to the birth, and many mums have found it so comfortable that they continue with it even after the baby is born.

One wrote: 'This pillow is a godsend, no more pain and such a comfy night's sleep, I don't think I'll ever be without it, even when baby is here!' 

The Hometex 9ft U Shaped Comfort Pregnancy Support Pillow is available in seven colours.
