Her doting mum Billie Faiers spent weeks planning the perfect lockdown birthday party fit for a princess turning six.

And Nelly Shepherd's special day turned out spectacularly with the little girl being treated to a garden filled with pastel coloured balloons, donuts and candyfloss.

However it was her baby brother Arthur, three, who stole Thursday night's episode of The Mummy Diaries, with fans laughing at the cheeky tot's behaviour.

Party time! Nelly Shepherd, six, was treated to an amazing Candyland themed birthday at her home in Essex during Thursday night's episode of the Mummy Diaries

Nelly's birthday party boasted a stylish set-up in the back garden of her Essex home, with Billie having planned a low seating area and balloon display.

On the guest list were auntie Sam and Paul as well as their children Paul and Rosie, with nanny Sue also bringing the birthday girl herself to the event after a sleepover. 

The children were seen enjoying themselves as they played and Greg handed out sweet pink candy-floss.  

However fans were left crying with laughter after Arthur featured in several funny moments during the show - including when he picked up a water gun and set his sights on dad Greg.

Cheeky! However it was Nelly's little brother Arthur who stole the show with his hilarious jokes and sayings

Prankster: The three-year-old sprayed his dad Greg with a water gun during one scene

After jumping around on Nelly's new huge bouncy castle the little boy sneaked up on his father and sprayed him with the gun.

Laughing at his adorable son, Greg joked that he was going to throw Arthur in the hot tub before he ran away.

But Arthur wasn't ready to surrender yet, instead coming back to spray Greg two more times.

Greg said with a smile: 'I like to think of myself as a prankster, and I think Arthur's following his dad's footsteps'  

Little joker: Arthur also opted for running instead of riding his bike, leaving that up to Greg

Putting in the effort: He also made sure to wish his sister happy bithday in style by dressing up as Spiderman

Adorable: The youngster did a thumbs up as he enjoyed a huge pink lolly at Nelly's party

Arthur also proved he's a star in front of the camera during the family's attempt at learning how to ride bikes.

Nelly, who recently had her stabilisers off and was getting to grips with balancing on two wheels, managed to roll along by herself after a few attempt.

But her little brother didn't appear very interested in learning about his own bike, instead opting to run around when he peddled backwards. 

Speaking about the children Billie and Greg said: 'Arthur, bless him, he's alright going down a hill - then he gets it.' 

Lucky girl! Nelly was given a bouncy castle by her doting dad Greg as she turned six

So much fun! The duo were joined by their cousins Paul and Rosie for a go on the huge castle

Amazing! Nelly appeared to be very impressed with her birthday gift

Later on in the episode the family also got to move back into their home which had just had a new kitchen put in.

Arthur was impressed with the fancy new white cupboards and gold taps, even hilariously picking up a toy screwdriver to do some 'finishing touches' to the oven.   

Fans loved seeing Arthur's cheeky side during the episode, with many taking to Twitter to say he was their favourite.











Love it! Fans were delighted with Arthur's cheeky personality during the show, with many declaring him their favourite

One person wrote: 'Say it every time I watch Mummy Diaries but Nelly and Arthur are actual screams I love them so much'

While another added: 'Arthur is the star of the show.' 

During the show Billie discussed how she had been worried that Nelly may not enjoy the party as she could be expecting something on a larger scale.

Pretty pastels: Billie spent weeks planning the garden party for Nelly, arranging a low seating area and pretty balloon display

What a cake! A very impressive cake with ice creams on top was also presented to Nelly

Look at this! Nelly couldn't wait to show auntie Sam her back garden birthday party

Billie explained: 'Nelly said to me "so there were 100 at my birthday last year, so how about 90 this year?" and I thought, "not really try losing the zero", but she's going to love having all her nearest and dearest there anyway.'

Greg also agreed that it was nice to be doing something on a smaller scale, sating that it's more 'relaxed' as usually things can get a bit 'ridiculous' with the 'whole school class and cousins. 

Meanwhile, Sam and Paul worried about sending their eldest son to school and decided that it would be good for him to attend summer camp for a week.

Although hesitant at first little Paul ended up loving his taste of school and making lots of friends.'
