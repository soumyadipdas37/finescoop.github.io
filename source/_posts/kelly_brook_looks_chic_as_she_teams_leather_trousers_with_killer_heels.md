She loves to dress to the nines for her stint at Heart FM. 

And Kelly Brook was channelling sexy office chic when she arrived at the Global Radio HQ in London on Wednesday. 

The 40-year-old presenter teamed a silk cream blouse with brown leather cropped trousers which showed off her slim legs.

Adding some height to her ensemble, she wore a sky high pair of nude Christian Louboutin Pigalle shoes, flashing the brand's iconic red soles. 

Looking every inch the superstar, she wore oversized tortoiseshell sunglasses and wore her hair in an updo. 

She carried a coveted current season Chanel quilted handbag which retail for more than £4000.

Happy: She flashed a friendly grin before heading inside to work 

Kelly's stylish display comes as she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up'.

She also declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March. 

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The media personality has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks. 

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
