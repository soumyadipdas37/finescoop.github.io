The Block was struck by yet another tragedy on Tuesday, with the death of Sarah Bragias' grandmother.

The 27-year-old teacher revealed her mother had called her husband, George Bragias, and she 'could tell in his face something was wrong'.

'I got on the phone to my mum and straight away, I knew something was up,' she tearfully recounted.

Unable to continue speaking, George, 33, stepped in and added: 'Sarah's grandmother passed away, so yeah, it wasn't good.'

After taking a moment to regain her composure, Sarah confessed the possibility of her grandmother dying had been the furthest thing from her mind.

'When you're on The Block, you just don't think those things happen. You think that the world stops with you, but it doesn't,' she cried.

Sarah admitted she was 'really nervous' to leave her room after getting the news, because she didn't want to 'face' what had happened.

She said she'd just 'needed time' to process her grief, before facing the show's other contestants.

The couple then met up with host Scott Cam, who vowed to do whatever he could to help them through their difficult time.

'We'll do whatever we can to make it a little bit better... We'll sort this out. This [The Block] is not important,' the 57-year-old told them.

'You just let us know when you need to go. We'll fly you anywhere. We'll fly you home. Stay overnight, stay with the family. Do not worry about this.' 

It's the second death on the show in as many weeks, following the death of Daniel's grandfather just a week earlier.

The 35-year-old was in the middle of bathroom renovations when his dad called to inform him his grandfather had died.

Clearly shocked by the heartbreaking turn of events, Daniel pulled wife Jade aside to inform her of the news, prompting her to break down and cry. 

'It's all good. We knew it was going on... He was sick. We knew that,' an emotional Daniel tried to reassure the 34-year-old, engulfing her in a hug.
