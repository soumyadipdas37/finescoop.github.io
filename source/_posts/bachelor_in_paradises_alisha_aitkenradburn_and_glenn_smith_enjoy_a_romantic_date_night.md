Last month, Alisha revealed how she and Glenn kept their romance under wraps before the hit show aired.   

Penning a lengthy post on Instagram the blonde bombshell said that she and Glenn, 'got lucky' that they could keep things on the down low. 

Alisha said that it wasn't just because they tried hard to keep things a secret, but said it's because a lot of people didn't recognise Glenn from his season of The Bachelorette. 

'We got lucky!' Bachelor In Paradise's Alisha Aitken-Radburn revealed on Tuesday, how she and Glenn Smith managed to keep their relationship 'hidden' before the show aired

'Lots of messages about how we stayed ''hidden'' but have clearly done a bunch of stuff,' Alisha said.

'I guess we just got lucky, @glennsmith87 wasn't SUPER recognisable from his season of Bachelorette (sorry babe) and you may or may not be surprised how fast people forget old cast of shows once new ones are airing.' 

She went on to say that most people who recognised her didn't 'put two and two together' that she was dating a fellow reality star. 

Spilling the beans! 'I guess we just got lucky, @glennsmith87 wasn't SUPER recognisable from his season of Bachelorette (sorry babe) and you may or may not be surprised how fast people forget old cast of shows once new ones are airing,' she said

'That doesn't mean we weren't nervous, we were nervous literally all the time but we also couldn't resist spending a full day drinking cocktails on a daybed at Finns (sorry Warner Brothers).'

Finns is a beach club in Bali. The pair holidayed there together in February. 

The blonde beauty accompanied the post with a sweet picture featuring her and Glenn enjoying a beer while on a holiday in the tropical paradise. 

Alisha looked casual chic in a pair of denim shorts and a navy top as she cuddled up to Glenn on the beach. 

Sorry Glenn! She went on to say that most people who recognised her didn't 'put two and two together' that she was dating Glenn
