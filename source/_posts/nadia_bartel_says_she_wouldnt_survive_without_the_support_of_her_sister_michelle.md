Nadia Bartel has paid tribute to her sister, Michelle Coppolino, on her 30th birthday.

The former WAG shared several photos featuring her sibling to Instagram on Thursday, including pictures from Michelle's wedding and family photos. 

The 35-year-old admitted that she wouldn't 'survive' without her sister and explained that they would celebrate with margaritas once the COVID-19 lockdowns in Melbourne were eased.
