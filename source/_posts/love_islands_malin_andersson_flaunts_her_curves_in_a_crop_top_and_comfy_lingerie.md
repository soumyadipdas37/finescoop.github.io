The star wore her raven tresses in soft waves while her pretty features were enhanced with a radiant palette of make-up.

She later slipped onto a crop-top and lingerie as she smiled for the camera while promoting the charity. 

Malin's beloved mother Consy died from breast cancer in November 2017, after losing her third battle with the deadly disease.

The reality star's mum battled breast cancer twice before the cancer spread again, she was first diagnosed in 2001- and on November 10 2017, Malin shared the devastating news that her mother was 'completely unable to eat' as the disease has spread to her bowels.

In a recent chat with MailOnline, Malin revealed that she is 'looking for love' and has started 'going on dates again' after her abusive ex-boyfriend Tom was jailed a few weeks ago. 

The 2016 Love Island star described how she would like to start a family and have 'one or two' children adding how she is a 'huge believer in the law of attraction'. 

The mental health campaigner also described how she 'benefitted' from lockdown which gave her the opportunity 'to do a lot more work on herself'.

She said: 'To be fair, do you know what, I am. I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?'

Malin, who also spoke about body positivity at the Lovehoney virtual love camp, added: 'I do want a family - I want a husband. 

'I want a good-looking little basketball player. I do like a basketball player and I want my family. I want a few kids maybe one or two I want a little dog.' 

Malin used to date Tom Kemp but the couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship and earlier this month, he was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'. 

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year. But Tom, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.
