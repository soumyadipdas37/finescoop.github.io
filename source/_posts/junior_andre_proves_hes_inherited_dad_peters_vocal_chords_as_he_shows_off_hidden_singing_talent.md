Junior Andre wowed fans as he showed off his impressive singing voice in mum Katie Price's latest YouTube video. 

The teenager, 15, proved he had inherited his father Peter Andre's singing abilities as he crooned for the camera, while his sister Princess, 13, filmed. 

In the video, released on Wednesday, Katie, 42, revealed her hair transformation while Junior and Princess entertained themselves with showing off for the camera.

He sang: 'I see you in the morning, baby girl. Let me sure you a little something from my world.' 

It comes after Pete posted a clip of Princess singing Hallelujah - made famous by Leonard Cohen and covered by Alexandra Burke - in the kitchen, while he cooked dinner in the background.

Singing over the track, Princess demonstrated her vocal stylings, with Pete nodding in the background.

He captioned the clip: 'When dads cooking and she hits the big note... #harmonies #fatherdaughter.'      

It comes as Pete's wife Emily revealed she was mortified when the singer turned up to her university halls of residence in a flashy Lamborghini during the early days of their romance. 

The Mysterious Girl hitmaker, 47, and his doctor wife, 31, joined Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes, both 60, for a special edition of Loose Women on Wednesday.

They spoke about the start of their relationship, which began in 2012, two years after they met through her surgeon father Ruaraidh, who introduced them after he performed emergency kidney stone removal on Peter.

Of his efforts, Emily said: 'That doesn't really float my boat, so I think he misjudged it slightly. 

'Because I couldn't care less about cars or anything. But he didn't do it again, that's for sure!' 

While Pete replied: 'It was just foolish and I don't know, I think in my thirties, I think I was having a mid-life crisis. I really do. In my forties, I just wouldn't do that now.'

Probing further, Ruth then asked whether at the time Peter was 'trying hard to woo her'.

With the singer responding: 'Yeah, because I really liked her and it took me so long to like her. Let me rephrase that, it took me so long to realise what I was feeling.

'Once I asked and got approval from her dad, I had to because he was my friend, I thought "I can't stuff this up". So I have to do what I can.'

Funny story: Pete replied: 'It was just foolish and I don't know, I think in my thirties, I think I was having a mid-life crisis. I really do. In my forties, I just wouldn't do that now.'
