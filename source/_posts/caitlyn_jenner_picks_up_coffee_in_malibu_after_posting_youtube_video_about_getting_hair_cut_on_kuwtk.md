She loves her daily Starbucks fix.

And on Wednesday, Caitlyn Jenner once again stopped by her local outlet in Malibu where she picked up a couple of cups of joe to go.

The transgender reality star, 70, wore a mask as required under California law due to the COVID-19 pandemic but didn't wear it properly as she left her nose uncovered. 

Coffee run: Caitlyn Jenner picked up cups of joe to go from her local Starbucks in Malibu on Monday. However, she failed to wear her face mask properly as she left her nose uncovered  

Caitlyn was seen exiting the coffee store wearing a gray polo shirt and skintight cropped leggings.

She stepped out in a pair of leather flip flops and wore a sun visor hat.

The former husband of Keeping Up With The Kardashians momager Kris Jenner sported sunglasses and a large black leather bag over one shoulder.

Casual: The transgender reality star, 70, wore a gray polo shirt and skintight cropped leggings. She wore a sun visor hat over her long hair that was styled in a ponytail

Caitlyn wore her long hair tied back into a ponytail, which was a propos given that earlier in the day she'd shared throwback video from KUWTK in which she and Kris faced off over a haircut.

In the video, posted to Caitlyn's new YouTube channel, Bruce, as she was then, is seen with Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian at a hair styling session.

The girls are encouraging him to get his hair cut while Bruce is reluctant because, he explains, he likes having a ponytail. 

In the end he gets a little trim but when Kris arrives to see how it's going, she is not amused.

Memories: Caitlyn has just launched her own YouTube channel and on Monday morning, she posted a new video in which she reflected on her years on Keeping Up With The Kardashians

Looking back: In the video, Bruce, as she was then, is seen  being encouraged to get a hair cut at a styling session because then wife Kris Jenner doesn't like him having a ponytail 

Step-children: Kourtney Kardashian, left, and Khloe Kardashian, right, try to encourage Bruce to make a change. But Khloe admits on camera that it's 'his head' so he can do what he wants

Just a trim: When Kris arrives to see what's going on, she is less than impressed that her husband isn't getting a short back and sides

Glam session: After his trim ,Bruce then got some highlights in his hair

Introducing the latest clips, the I Am Cait star quipped: 'I have the best home movies out there!'

In another segment, Caitlyn recalls the time that Kris put Viagra in his morning coffee, only for Kris' son Rob Kardashian to pick up the mug in the kitchen by mistake.

There then ensued great hilarity at the unfortunate Rob who suffered a lasting erection and had to seek medical help.

The father of Kendall and Kylie Jenner announced her gender transition back in 2015, the same year that her marriage to Kris formally ended.

She went on to star in the E! reality show I Am Cait which ran for two seasons. 

Kris was previously married to O.J. Simpson friend and defense attorney Robert Kardashian with whom she shares Rob, Kourtney, Khloe and Kim.  

Funny: Introducing the latest clips, the I Am Cait star, who transitioned in 2015, quipped: 'I have the best home movies out there!'

Mix up: In another segment, Caitlyn recalls the time that Kris put Viagra in his morning coffee, only for Kris' son Rob Kardashian to pick up the mug in the kitchen by mistake

It was meant for Bruce: There then ensued great hilarity at the unfortunate Rob who suffered a lasting erection and had to seek medical help, as his mother confessed to what she had done

Blushed: Rob described the experience as 'the most embarrassing thing' that had ever happened to him
