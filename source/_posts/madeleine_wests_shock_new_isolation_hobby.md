Former Neighbours star Madeleine West has always been candid with her followers.

And this was particularly evident in her latest column for 9Honey on Friday.

The 40-year-old revealed her shock new hobby that she began during isolation.

'Perhaps it's a mid-life crisis': Former Neighbours star Madeleine West (pictured), 40, revealed her shock new hobby in her latest column for 9Honey on Friday 

Madeleine explained how she came across the world of gaming, when introduced to dance video game 'Beat Sabre' by a pregnant friend.

She kept her new hobby a secret from her family, until she accidentally let it slip while driving her son to soccer practice.  

'Geralt, just the name powers up my hard drive, comes from Rivia,' Madeleine said, referencing video game series, 'The Witcher'.

'He is broad, he is brooding, he's a superhuman monster slayer, and hero of lauded game of conquest.' 

Gamer: The former Neighbours star explained how she became a gamer during isolation. She sought a more interactive video game after trying out dance workout 'Beat Sabre' 

Surprising pastime: 'Geralt, just the name powers up my hard drive, comes from Rivia,' Madeleine said, referencing video game series, 'The Witcher'  

Having once played Pac-Man, Madeleine joked that her taste in men has 'matured'.

'Perhaps my taste in animated men is maturing. Perhaps I'm just having a mid-life crisis. Either way, I feel I am evolving,' she said.  

Madeleine shares children Phoenix, Hendrix, Xascha, Xanthe, Xalia and Margaux, with ex-partner, chef Shannon Bennett.

The couple began dating in 2004 but never married.   

Poking fun at herself: Having once played Pac-Man, Madeleine joked that her taste in men has 'matured': 'Perhaps my taste in animated men is maturing. Perhaps I'm just having a mid-life crisis. Either way, I feel I am evolving' 

Madeleine spoke about their split on The Kyle and Jackie O show last year.

'I'm a big believer that everything in life has a season... we change, we evolve.

'At some point we go, "Well I have certain needs I want to have met and you've got certain needs", and if the two don't combine and cross in the middle, why fight it and be miserable?'   

'I don't think that's fair to the children either, to see two parents that are constantly at cross-purposes,' she continued.
