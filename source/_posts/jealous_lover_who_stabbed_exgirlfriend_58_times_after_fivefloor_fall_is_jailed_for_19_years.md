A woman who repeatedly stabbed her immobilised and defenceless former girlfriend after she had just fallen from an inner-Sydney balcony has been jailed for at least 19 years.

Zixi Wang, 30, was sentenced by Justice Robert Beech-Jones in the Supreme Court on Thursday to a maximum 25 years and six months after pleading guilty to the murder.

Justice Beech-Jones described her 'brutally' stabbing of 23-year-old Shuyu Zhou 58 times as an extreme example of domestic violence.

'The final moments of Ms Zhou's far too brief life were lived in excruciating pain, fear and terror, all of which the offender is responsible for,' he said.

In June 2019, Ms Zhou visited Wang's Zetland apartment to pick up some belongings after ending their relationship four months earlier.

Neighbours heard screams coming from the apartment along with the sound of smashing and objects being dragged along the ground.

Frightened and wanting to escape, Ms Zhou tried to climb over the balcony but slipped and plunged five storeys down.

'Disturbing and graphic' video footage earlier played before the court showed the moment she landed facedown onto a fence before falling back onto the ground and writhing in pain.

Wang calmly catches the elevator down and makes a 'pitiless' inspection of her former partner before returning with a knife and repeatedly slashing her while she lay immobilised and defenceless.

At one point inside the elevator Wang checks her appearance in the mirror and fixes her hair and returns in a fresh pair of pants.

'Even though (the stabs) were only administered in just under two minutes, they were not all delivered in a frenzy,' Justice Beech-Jones said.

'Instead the offender appears to briefly assess the impact of each wound or group of wounds before continuing.'

Pathologists later concluded the cause of death was not from the fall but from stabbings to her neck.

'How could the feelings of anger bitterness and rejection that welled up in the offender from the breakdown of her relationship ... not dissipate to at least let her have some modicum of sympathy as she saw Ms Zhou helpless and writhing in agony after that fall,' Justice Beech-Jones said.

'Even then the offender did not call for help or render any assistance.'  

When significant blood flowed from Ms Zhou's jugular vein, Wang fled and hid the knife in a raised garden bed and drove out to the Illawarra region.

She was arrested near the Sea Cliff Bridge, north of Wollongong, and later told police she wanted to jump off to end her life.

In a letter to the court Wang expressed remorse and deep shame for her actions, and said she had slipped into a deep depression in the months before the attack.

She recalls holding Ms Zhou's hand that night and pleading with her not to leave before blocking her path.

She said she had been drinking heavily but Justice Beech-Jones assessed her behaviour as composed and deliberate.

Ms Zhou's blood was later found in the kitchen, living room and on the sliding door frame, while Wang received some scratches and one bite mark.

Wang will be eligible for release on June 18, 2038.
