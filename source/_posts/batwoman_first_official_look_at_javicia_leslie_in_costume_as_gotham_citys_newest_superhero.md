When season two of The CW's Batwoman premieres in January 2021, Javicia Leslie will become the first Black actress to play the superhero in a live-action television series.

And now, with her debut now less than four months away, fans are getting a first official look at its new leading lady in costume. 

Leslie can be seen wearing the same outfit Ruby Rose's Kate Kane wore in the first season, but the new heroine promises that her Ryan Wilder character will put her own personal touch on the Batsuit.

'Look out, Gotham, I'm suited up and ready to go,' the Maryland native wrote in the caption of her Instagram post on Friday.

'But just wait until Ryan Wilder puts her own spin on the Batsuit. @cwbatwoman'

DC Comics also shared the image of Leslie in costume on Twitter, writing: 'She's here to protect Gotham. Get a first look at @JaviciaLeslie as #Batwoman.'

In the promo photo, the 33-year-old actress can be seen flashing a stern and focused look into the camera wearing the iconic Batwoman winged-mask.

And like Rose, who stepped down from the titular role following season one, Leslie is donning long, fiery-red tresses with some added soft waves.

In season one, Rose's Kate Kane set out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of Gotham City as Batwoman, some three years after the disappearance of her cousin Bruce Wayne/Batman. 

Kane's disappearance will be written into the story in season two, which will portray Ryan Wilder as likable, messy, slightly goofy and untamed.

Like Kane, Wilder be an out and proud lesbian, with her own personal issues that includes being a drug runner who has crossed paths with the GCPD in the past.

Leslie, who's best known for her roles on God Friended Me and The Family Business, sounded proud and humble when she addressed some of the responsibilities that come with such a high-profile role as Batwoman.

'I am extremely proud to be the first Black actress to play the iconic role of Batwoman on television, and as a bisexual woman, I am honored to join this groundbreaking show which has been such a trailblazer for the LGBTQ+ community,' Leslie said in a statement in July.  

Again, season two of Batwoman is expected to premiere in January on The CW.
