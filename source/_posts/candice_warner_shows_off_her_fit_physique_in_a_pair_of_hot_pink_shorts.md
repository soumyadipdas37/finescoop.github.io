She also wore a white racerback singlet top, which showed off her toned biceps. 

She rounded out her sporty ensemble with a pair of stylish leopard print Nike sneakers. 

After stopping off at a 7-Eleven convenience store, Candice was trailed by one of her daughters, who she treated to a blue Slurpee.

Candice held onto the drink as they returned to their car, helping her little girl into the backseat.

She appeared to have come straight from the gym, and shared a series of videos from her workout on Instagram Stories on Thursday.
