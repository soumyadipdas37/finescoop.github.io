Donald Trump thought his supporters would think it's cool he 'slept with a porn star', and commented on how 'hot' Michael Cohen's then 15-year-old daughter was, according to his former fixer's bombshell new book. 

Michael Cohen also describes the married Trump ogling contestants at his Miss Universe pageant and boasting he could 'have all of them' if he wanted. He also claimed to have seen Trump corner and forcibly kiss women at his office. 

Cohen's memoir, Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump, hits bookshelves Tuesday, despite his currently serving out a three-year federal prison sentence for tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations.

In the book, Cohen reveals information about a variety of alleged Trump actions and statements that have made headlines since the former reality TV star ran for office, according to the Washington Post, which obtained an advance copy of it.  

The president is said to have told aides his supporters would think it's cool he 'slept with a porn star' after Stormy Daniels' claims of an extramarital affair with Trump and 'forcibly kissed women in his office', the book alleges.  

Cohen also writes of Trump leering at Cohen's then-15-year-old daughter Samantha at Trump's New Jersey golf club in 2012. He is said to have inadvertently commented to Cohen on his daughter: 'Look at that piece of a***. I would love some of that.' 

Cohen writes that when he told Trump that it was his daughter, Trump replied: 'When did she get so hot?' 

Trump is also said to have been dismissive of some of his own children, including his eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and youngest daughter Tiffany.    

The White House called his memoir 'fan fiction.' 

'He readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales,' White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement. 'It's unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump.'

Trump, despite his later protestations, green-lighted the $130,000 payment to silence Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, reasoning he would 'have to pay' his wife a far greater sum if the affair ever became known, Cohen writes, adding the president later reimbursed him with 'fake legal fees.'  

'It never pays to settle these things, but many, many friends have advised me to pay,' Trump said, according to Cohen. 'If it comes out, I'm not sure how it would play with my supporters. But I bet they'd think it's cool that I slept with a porn star.'

Cohen calls the president 'a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.' 

Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other crimes, including lying to Congress, calls himself the 'star witness' of a hush-money conspiracy that still could culminate in charges for Trump after he leaves office. 

He described his new book as a 'fundamental piece of evidence' of the president's guilt.

Cohen writes that Trump's three oldest children came to Cohen's office after Trump's campaign announcement in 2015, in which Trump referred to people coming to the U.S. from Mexico as rapists and murderers. Cohen says they asked him to convince their father to drop out of the race, arguing his rhetoric was 'killing the company.'

The former fixer says Trump was unconcerned with any harm to his businesses. 'Plus, I will never get the Hispanic vote,' Trump said, according to Cohen. 'Like the blacks, they're too stupid to vote for Trump. They're not my people.'

He wrote that during the 2016 campaign, Trump allegedly said that minorities were 'not my people' and that the president also supposedly claimed he would 'never get the Hispanic vote,' because, 'Like the blacks, they're too stupid to vote for Trump.' 

The disbarred lawyer detailed Trump's 'hatred and contempt' of Obama, too.

Cohen revealed that at some point in time, Trump allegedly hired a 'Faux-Bama' to star in a video, in which Trump 'ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him,' CNN reported Cohen as having written.  

Over the years, Trump has been criticized for spreading 'birther' statements, which insinuated that Obama was unqualified to be president because he might not have been born in the US - an untrue theory. 

Among Cohen's book's claims was that Trump said the only reason why Obama had been admitted to Columbia University for undergrad and then Harvard Law School was because of 'f---ing affirmative action.'

Cohen also wrote that Trump's 'low opinion of all black folks' included him allegedly saying: 'Tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a s---hole. They are all complete f---ing toilets.'

According to Cohen, Trump used the 's**thole' phrase again, when talking about South African President Nelson Mandela. 

When Mandela died in 2013, Cohen wrote that Trump didn't think Mandela 'was a real leader — not the kind he respected.'

Cohen claimed that Trump said 'Mandela f---ed the whole country up. Now it's a s---hole. F--- Mandela. He was no leader.'  

Mandela was a key figure in ending apartheid in South Africa, a practice which divided the country along racial lines. 

Trump was slammed in January 2018 after he allegedly said, during an Oval Office meeting about the visa lottery, 'Why do we want all these people from 's**thole countries' coming here?' while supposedly referring to Central American and African nations. 

He later denied making the 's**thole countries' remark. 

Despite all this, Cohen wrote that he never heard Trump utter the 'N-word.' 

In another anecdote that bites from headline-making news about Trump, Cohen wrote about a supposed 2013 visit Trump made to a Las Vegas strip club.  

Cohen wrote that Trump went to the strip club with Russian father-son oligarchs Aras and Emin Agalarov. 

During the visit, Cohen claimed that they watched as one of the strip club performers simulated urinating on another performer, who then pretended to drink it. 

According to Cohen, Trump reaction to what they saw on stage was 'disbelief and delight.'

Cohen wrote that Trump said the only reason why Barack Obama (pictured) got into Columbia University and Harvard Law was 'affirmative action'

Cohen also said that while there was no collusion with Russia during the 2016 election, Trump (left) had cozied up with President Vladimir Putin (right) to help push along a future real estate development deal in Moscow

In January 2017, word surfaced of a so-called 'pee tape,' which was supposedly filmed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, when Trump was attending the Miss Universe pageant there. 

In the alleged video - described in the Steele Dossier - Trump was said to have watched two prostitutes as they urinated on a bed Barack and Michelle Obama supposedly slept in.  

The tape was supposedly made because Russia's state security agency, the FSB, had the hotel under surveillance and had multiple microphones and hidden cameras in the room. 

Cohen wrote of the tape that 'this claim never occurred, to the best of my knowledge and investigations.' 

Cohen also sheds light on Trump's admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he admired him most because he 'had the balls to take over an entire nation and run it like it was his personal company.' 

But he added that Trump's campaign had been 'far too chaotic and incompetent to actually conspire with the Russian government.' 

On a more personal note, Cohen included some alleged details about Trump's much discussed hairstyle. 

In the memoir, Cohen wrote that the distinctive hairdo is a 'three-step' combover, which was developed as a way to hide what Cohen called 'unsightly scars on his scalp from a failed hair-implant operation in the 1980s.'

Cohen wrote that he once saw Trump post-shower, when his hair was down. 

According to Cohen, Trump's 'strands of dyed-golden hair reached below his shoulders along the right side of his head and on his back, like a balding Allman Brother or strung out old '60s hippie.'

Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other crimes, including lying to Congress, calls himself the 'star witness' of a hush-money conspiracy that still could culminate in charges for Trump after he leaves office. He described his new book as a 'fundamental piece of evidence' of the president's guilt

Beyond his dealings with Trump, Cohen waxes nostalgic about experiences he says informed his fierce loyalty and attack-dog persona. The Long Island native, a Holocaust survivor's son, writes of rubbing shoulders with mobsters at his uncle's club, where he worked as a teen. After witnessing a poolside shooting, he says he felt a duty to keep quiet. A few days later, he writes, a tough-looking fellow handed him an envelope stuffed with $500 cash.

Cohen has led a publicity blitz around his memoir even as he serves his federal sentence in home confinement. A judge ruled this summer that authorities had retaliated against him, sending him back to prison in upstate New York after he was furloughed because of the coronavirus pandemic, for publishing the book ahead of the November election.

Cohen was released to home confinement in July and the government lifted a ban on him speaking publicly.

'This story is all I have left for my wife, my children and the country I love so much,' Cohen writes.  

In a statement to the Washington Post Saturday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that 'Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. He has lost all credibility, and it's unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.'

The White House, meanwhile told the AP that the memoir amounted to 'fan fiction.'

Cohen 'readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales,' White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement to the news agency. 

'It's unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump.' 

Cohen's allegations — his most detailed to date — are part of an unsparing and deeply personal put-down of Trump. Cohen assails Trump as an 'organized crime don' and 'master manipulator,' but allows that he saw much of himself in a man he once considered a father figure.

'I care for Donald Trump, even to this day,' Cohen writes, 'and I had and still have a lot of affection for him.'

The White House called Cohen's book 'fan fiction' and questioned his credibility

Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump's former lawyer, speaks to reporters as he leaves his apartment building to report to federal prison in May last year 

Cohen remains at a loss to explain his unswerving allegiance to a cutthroat businessman who abandoned him at the most vulnerable point in his life. He likens his fealty to Trump to a mental illness and said he thought of himself as acting like a drug user in need of an intervention.

'It seemed to (my family) that I wouldn't listen to anyone, not even the people who loved me most, as I gradually gave up control of my mind to Trump,' Cohen writes.

'I confess I never really did understand why pleasing Trump meant so much to me,' Cohen adds. 'To this day I don't have the full answer.'

The memoir offers an introspective — and at times self-loathing — apology for the role Cohen played in Trump's political ascent. He urged Trump for years to run for president but now laments that his election 'led the nation and maybe even the world to the brink of disaster.'

'I thought Trump was a visionary with a no-nonsense attitude and the charisma to attract all kinds of voters,' he writes. But the real reason he wanted Trump in the White House, Cohen concedes, 'was because I wanted the power that he would bring to me.'

Cohen expresses little to no remorse for his federal crimes, saying he was 'railroaded' by the government and pleaded guilty after prosecutors threatened to indict his wife.
