The reality TV star dated Wes Nelson and Eyal Booker on the ITV show back in 2018 but has since been linked to Chelcee Grimes and TOWIE's Demi Sims.

Discussing her plans for the future, Megan explained how she can 'picture her life with a woman' and may even settle down if she finds the right person.

Megan said: 'After the relationship with the girl [former footballer Chelcee], I was like, "I'm definitely never dating men again".

'I thought, "I only want a woman". It feels like a different dynamic and I felt more myself and more content than I ever had felt with a guy. I can see myself marrying a woman.'

Beauty: The former Love Island star looked incredible as she showcased  her ample assets in the garment while enjoying an evening meal with her friends 

She also revealed that when she met Chelcee, she knew that she was 'madly in love with a woman' in comparison to how things weren't really 'that deep' with Demi.

Megan and Chelcee have recently been seen spending time together again and were pictured locking lips last month.

However Megan didn't give too much away, simply revealing they've been 'hanging out' but that she's 'super busy' so couldn't commit to a relationship now.

The beauty also revealed that although lots of social events were cancelled during lockdown she's still been busy earning money.

Megan explained how after moving back to her parents' Essex home she's managed to rake in £100K by selling snaps on OnlyFans when she was 'bored'.

The media personality also discussed where she gets her incredible confidence from and ended up accrediting it to her past work in strip clubs.

However things haven't always gone smoothly in her relationships and Megan spoke of how one ex boyfriend believed she was using him for sex.

She added: 'I would say I'm a pin-up. I use my sexuality and my looks. I've always used them.'
