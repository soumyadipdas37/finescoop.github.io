She was one of five stars sent home during Wednesday night's eviction bloodbath on The Bachelor. 

And now blonde bombshell Charley Bond has weighed in on the kiss Bella Varelis and Locky Gilbert shared at the cocktail party that made Roxi Kenny see red.

'I'm all for it. You have to remember where you are. We are on The Bachelor,' the 25-year-old blonde told The Courier Mail on Wednesday.

'I'm all for it!' On Wednesday, Charley Bond (pictured) defended Bella Varelis and Locky Gilbert's cocktail party kiss on The Bachelor 

'If my lips were there ready for a smooch from Bach, I'm not going to pull away. I think it's fine,' she told the publication. 

On Wednesday night, Roxi was reduced to tears after Locky Gilbert kissed Bella Varelis at the evening's cocktail party - hours after she shared a smooch with the handsome hunk herself. 

Viewers of the Channel Ten hit show were left baffled by Roxi's theatrical turn - with some unsure what all the fuss was about.

'You have a rose Roxi, calm down,' Tweeted one viewer.

Meanwhile, a second viewer didn't understand what all the fuss was about. 'Didn't Roxi just kiss Locky like an hour ago? Why is she upset?' they wrote. 

A third viewer appeared to be frustrated by Roxi's emotional outbursts, writing: 'Uh, it's called The Bachelor, not the Roxi Drama show.'

And a fourth seemed to share the same sentiment. 'Roxi is that girl who signs up for MasterChef but can't even boil water.'

In a piece to camera, Locky explained himself.

'There's a process, I'm not trying to hurt anyone, but I am trying to find the person I want to spend the rest of my life with,' he began. 

'Roxi, yes, I should have been more respectful of you, but... There's 15 girls here, and I've got connections with other girls besides you. And I'm sorry for that.'

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
