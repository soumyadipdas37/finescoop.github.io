She found fame on the 2019 series of Love Island before quitting the show early when her romance with Curtis Pritchard didn't work out.

And Amy Hart looked nothing short of sensational as she enjoyed a day by the pool during her trip to Portugal.

The former Love Island star, 27, showcased her incredible figure in a one-piece swimsuit with a leopard and tiger print.

Amy cinched her waist with a black belt while she also sported a pair of sunglasses as she went for a dip.

The reality star styled her blonde locks into an updo for the day while she appeared to go makeup free for the day.

Amy took to her Instagram Stories and shared a snap of herself donning a face mask while on her flight back to the UK. 

It comes after Amy proved there were no hard feelings with ex Curtis Pritchard as the former flames happily posed for a snap together late last month.

The blonde beauty cosied up to Curtis, 24, in a sweet snap captioned: 'Nostalgia babes x', five months after his split from fellow Islander Maura Higgins, 29.

Curtis also posted a snap of the pair, captioned:'Good to see you x @amyhartxo.'

In the wake of the reunion Amy has now re-followed her ex Curtis on Instagram.

Later on the evening, Amy looked a little worse for wear as she put on an animated display and hung onto her friend while leaving the Proud Embankment venue after the boozy Cabaret All Stars Show in London.

Curtis, a professional ballroom dancer with a talent for tango, left Amy devastated after he started to chase after single Islander Jourdan Riane while Amy was away in Casa Amor.

Former air-stewardess Amy then told producers she wanted to leave the August series, after her 'half-boyfriend' split with her and began to chase after Islander Maura, who he went on to date, but split from in March.
