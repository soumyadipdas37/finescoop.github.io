Iconic ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's has released a new 'Dough-licious Ice Cream Pizza', following the success of their ice cream burger which was released earlier in the year.  

The innovative concept re-imagines the definition of 'pizza' while delivering a unique sweet treat and celebrating everything Australians love about ice cream.

The 'pizza' features a delectable baked cookie base, made from Ben & Jerry's' world-famous cookie dough, together with an ice cream filling full of delicious chunks, creamy swirls and your choice of toppings.

The exciting new offering is priced at $10.90 and is available at all Ben and Jerry's stores across Australia from Tuesday for a limited time only.

Ben & Jerry's has unveiled a 'Dough-licious Pizza', which is the latest instalment in the 'Fast Food Series' 

Customers can choose from a variety of toppings to load onto the pizza, including chunky cookie dough bite pieces, brownie chunks, crunchy nuts and pretzels along with hot fudge or caramel sauce.

Customers can order a slice for themselves or buy a whole pizza to share with friends.

The Dough-licious Pizza is the second menu item in the Fast Food Series and brings 'pizza' to life in a way customers have never seen before.
