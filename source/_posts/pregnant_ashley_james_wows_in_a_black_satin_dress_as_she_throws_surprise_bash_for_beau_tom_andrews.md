Ashley conjured major food envy among her social media followers as she shared pictures of the mouth-watering delights on Instagram. 

The mother-to-be reflected on the eventful day: 'The last hoorah! Last night I managed to pull off the perfect surprise party at home for Tommy - I'm so happy we got to do it ahead of the new restrictions.

Sugar explosion: Ashley had a custom cake made out of Tom's favourite sweet treats such as Nutella and peanut butter as she declared it was the most 'epic' tasting cake 'ever'

'Because of lockdown, Tommy's not been able to see his friends, and I've not got to meet a lot of them (apart from on Zoom), so I really wanted to be able to make that happen before the baby comes along.

'Holy f**k I could never be unfaithful, because keeping secrets is so unnerving and I was so paranoid he knew about it. 

'So whilst we were in Cambridge I arranged for the drinks to arrive, the amazing @boubouevents to come and create that epic balloon display (the theme was baby boy / birmingham football club), and a chef from @yhangry to come and cook some party food.

'I can't recommend them enough, the food is honestly insane and it's not a lot more than going to a restaurant (I paid but was given a discount) - I've shared a discount code on my stories if anyone wants.

'@lizziebatchelar created the most epic cake, and the weather held out so we could sit outside too. I had to wear flip flops because wow that was a long day. I managed to sneak off to bed early, but I still feel like I've got a hangover today despite not drinking (obviously!).

'I've always loved throwing surprise parties and having adventures, I get more pleasure from giving stuff like that than giving (or receiving gifts), and it was so nice to be able to celebrate safely (it was within the guidelines by the way) before baby comes along.'
