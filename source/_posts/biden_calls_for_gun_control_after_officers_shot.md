Joe Biden called for gun control, less than 24 hours after two LA County sheriff's deputies were shot in the head and wounded during an ambush in Compton.

'Weapons of war have no place in our communities,' the former Vice President tweeted. 'We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.'

Despite calling the shooting 'unconscionable' earlier in the day and demanding justice, Biden's comments were in stark contrast to Trump's call for a 'fast trial' and the death penalty for the 'animal' who carried it out - should the officers die.
