Jeffrey Epstein (pictured in his mugshot in 2017) was secretly bankrolled by the father of his alleged madam and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, a new report claims

Jeffrey Epstein was secretly bankrolled by the father of his alleged madam and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, a new report claims.  

The source of the pedophile's massive fortune - which was valued at roughly $636million after his jail cell suicide last fall - has long been shrouded in mystery. 

For decades Epstein ran his own wealth management fund - but its assets have never been made public and it was known to have served just a handful of ultra-rich clients. 

One year after his death, an insider has revealed that Epstein received a helping hand from disgraced British newspaper baron Robert Maxwell - his 'madam' Ghislaine's dad.  

The anonymous insider told The Sun that famed modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, a longtime acquaintance of Epstein, exposed Robert Maxwell's ties to Epstein in a conversation with friends nearly 20 years ago.

US investigators investigating Epstein's alleged child sex trafficking ring - and the accomplices who helped facilitate it - have now reportedly secured sworn testimony about Robert Maxwell's involvement with the pedophile. 

Robert Maxwell is known as one of Britain's most powerful media magnates and most notorious fraudsters.

He spent his business career investing in Israel's economy after losing most of his family during the Holocaust and moving to the UK to build a publishing empire. 

He died aged 68 in suspicious circumstances after falling off his megayacht in 1991. After his death, he was revealed to have stolen £500million ($623 million) from employee pension funds.

A former close associate of Brunel - who is on the run after being accused of helping procure underage girls for Epstein - told The Sun that the Frenchman spoke to friends about Robert Maxwell back in 2002.  

'Jean-Luc was telling them how Ghislaine's father Robert Maxwell was one of the reasons why Jeffrey Epstein had money,' the source said.

'He said Maxwell had been one of Epstein's early investment clients. I assumed that Maxwell had invested in Epstein, who then used that money to make his own.

'Jean-Luc also started talking about a book featuring Robert Maxwell and wanted to get hold of a copy straight away.' 

Robert Maxwell's daughter Ghislaine moved to New York City soon after her dad's death and started dating Epstein.  

How she met Epstein remains unknown, but The Sun's latest report suggests that they could have met through her father.

Epstein began making a name for himself in finance after he joined Bear Stearns in 1976 and quickly rose through the ranks, jumping from junior assistant to partner in just a few years. 

He went on to found his own wealth management firm with Victoria's Secret mogul Les Wexner as his largest client.  

Dozens of women have accused Epstein of raping them at his many properties around the world.  

Several alleged victims have described Ghislaine as Epstein's chief enabler, recruiting and grooming young girls for abuse. 

Epstein, 66, was facing sex trafficking charges in Manhattan when he killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial. 

Ghislaine, 58, went on the run after Epstein's suicide and was finally arrested at her compound in New Hampshire in July.  

She is accused of enticing underage girls to travel for sex, actually having sex with them and Epstein and later lying about it under oath in depositions when she was being sued by Virginia Giuffre Roberts, one of Epstein's accusers who says she had sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. 

Maxwell pleaded not guilty to the charges against her and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn until her trial.
