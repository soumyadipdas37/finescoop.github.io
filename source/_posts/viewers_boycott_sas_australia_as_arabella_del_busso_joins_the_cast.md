She's one of Australia's most controversial WAGs, and fans are furious Arabella Del Busso will appear on Channel Seven's upcoming series, SAS Australia.

The charges were dropped against the 31-year-old NRL player in late February, but fans aren't happy Arabella has now landed a role on the new adrenaline reality series.
