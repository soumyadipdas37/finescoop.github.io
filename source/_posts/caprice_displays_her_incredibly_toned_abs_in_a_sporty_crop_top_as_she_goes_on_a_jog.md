She's been moving on from a 'terrifying' £40,000 raid which took place at her holiday house in Ibiza last month.

And Caprice focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle as she embarked on a jog near her London home on Sunday.

The model, 48, showcased her incredibly toned midsection in a sporty, long-sleeved crop top, which she teamed with tiny green shorts.

Dancing On Ice star Caprice, who shares sons Jett and Jax, six, with husband Ty Comfort, 54, looked as youthful as ever as she kept up with her active exercise regime.

The media personality rounded things off with white trainers while opting for minimal accessories.

Despite working up a sweat, the businesswoman still managed to glow in neutral-toned make-up and wore her tresses in straight locks.

Caprice recently criticised the government for 'not doing enough' to track and trace travellers amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Earlier this month, the TV star returned to her London home from a trip to Ibiza and is now entering her second week of quarantine − during which she has been seen taking on the viral wine challenge as she passes time at home.

But the mother-the-two, who has been outspoken about the way in which British officials should be handling the novel coronavirus crisis, is now urging from more stringent action, sources have exclusively revealed to MailOnline.

An insider said: 'Caprice and family are in their second week of quarantine after returning from Ibiza. She was surprised she received a call from someone to check she was actually at home and quarantining.

'She was impressed by this but doesn’t think the government is doing enough. She feels there could be much smarter airport testing like in other countries.'

According to the source, Caprice cites 'official research' in insisting that while airport testing detects 7 per cent of potential cases, conducting a second test five days later would pick up 85 per cent, while a space of eight days would yield 96 per cent.

'This has been successful in other countries,' explained the source. 'It is just another thing that is crippling the economy and what we all need now is to stabilise and help it grow, not weaken the economy even more.'
