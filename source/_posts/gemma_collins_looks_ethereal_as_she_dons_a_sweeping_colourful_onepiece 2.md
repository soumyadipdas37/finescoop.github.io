Gemma Collins looked sensational on Monday as she posted an ethereal snap by the ocean.

Posing in a throwback from one of her recent summertime jaunts, the reality sensation, 39, donned a colourful swimming costume, with a matching headpiece and sarong.

Swishing the sarong around her frame, Gemma - who has recently shed three stone - flaunted her physique and showed off her deep tan.

Gemma went barefoot for the snap, which was taken on a wooden terrace with a clear glass balcony, thought to be in Greece.

Gemma proved to be her own best spokes-model, advertising the look from her own clothing brand.

It comes amid reports that Gemma is set to cash in with a mega bucks deal with fashion brand In The Style.

The deal follows the huge success of here meme collection with the retailer, with big names including Little Mix's Jade Thirwall seen wearing clothes from the range.

The blonde apparently raked in £100,000 in just one day earlier this year through sales of her new sweatshirt after Jade was spotted wearing one.

In The Style reportedly flew the TOWIE favourite to the Greek island to get snaps of her latest clothing range.

A source told The Mirror: 'Gemma's made a mint for In The Style – her meme range was a sell out and stars like Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall have been seen in her designs.' 

They continued: 'They were desperate to get Gemma on board for a whole collection and she signed on the dotted line without hesitation.

'Gemma is so into her fashion and she loves the team at ITS so it was a no-brainer. Gemma flew out to Greece at the start of this week to model her debut line.'

MailOnline have contacted a representative of Gemma for comment.     

Meanwhile on Thursday, the self-professed diva took to Instagram once again to show off her slimmed-down figure in a rainbow coloured swimsuit with matching sarong and turban. 

The former TOWIE star struck a sultry pose as she gazed into the camera while standing in front of a stunning seascape for the breathtaking snap.

Sun-kissed: She has jetted off to a mystery sun-soaked location after denying she had found love with millionaire businessman Nadir Gul

Clearly happy to escape the stormy British weather, she captioned the sizzling post: 'Sending KISSES. GC my VITAMIN D TOUR continues!'

Although not clarifying where she had jetted off too, she played Greek music in one of her Instagram stories as she showed off her incredible villa.

Gemma's holiday comes after she insisted she's single following reports that she had found love with Nadir Gul.

She insisted she's 'just friends' with the millionaire businessman, as Nadir also denied the romance claims, pointing out that he's been in a relationship with someone else for 10 years.  

Gemma took to her Instagram stories earlier last week to set the record straight, telling fans that the only person she's in love with is herself, one month after her explosive split from Arg.

Speaking to camera while having fun with friends and family, Gemma added: 'Happy Sunday... and the only person I'm in love with right now is myself.'  

Earlier in the day, Nadir took to social media to state that the stories about him and Gemma are 'crazy false' and that he's been with someone else for 10 years. 

He wrote:  'Just woke up and seen all these crazy false stories. Gemma Collins and her family have been very loyal customers and friends of Shish meze and myself for many years. 

'But please show some respect as I am a family man and had a partner for over 10 year.'

Nadir also posted a picture of himself with his longtime love spending time together in Turkey.   

Gemma and Nadir have allegedly known each other for years during their time in Essex, and the GC has often found herself eating at his restaurants.  

Last month, Gemma announced her split from Arg by posting break up texts on her Instagram account in which James called her a 'hippo'. 

In the texts, the musician also called his partner a 'fat f**k', after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner and not her.

The series of texts began with Gemma saying: 'What man pays for another woman!!!', while Arg responded by saying: 'Insensitive.'

Gemma later apologised for releasing explosive text messages he had sent her, while friends have urged James to 'sort his life out'.  

In a screenshot obtained by MailOnline, the Diva On Lockdown star contacted her fellow reality star in the early hours of the morning.

She wrote: 'I am sorry about putting the messages up, I was just so hurt you suggested an open relationship, it didn't look like a joke when you typed it.

'I was so upset but I shouldn't have put the messages up, that was anger on my part which was wrong. I am so sorry about that x.' (sic)
