Mark Wright has reportedly landed role fronting the pilot for a new show in the United States after winning over producers with his 'cheeky persona'.

The former TOWIE star, 33, returned to the UK last year after leaving his position at Extra, amid claims he struggled living apart from wife Michelle Keegan.

However it looks like the reality personality it set to have another crack at breaking America, and this time Michelle, also 33, might be going with him.

According to the Sun the pilot was filmed last month and Mark is already hoping that it could mark a return to America after previously living there for two years.

An insider revealed: 'He was chosen to front a new pilot by a TV ­network in the US who are keen to see if they can get him back on screen.

'Obviously the dream would be to become as big as his pal James Corden, who landed his own chat show out there on CBS.'

While Mark was away filming for Extra Michelle was based in South Africa filming for BBC1 drama Our Girl, however they are now both based in Essex.  

Suggesting that Michelle would join Mark on his latest project, a source revealed: 'If the right chance did come up they'd see if they could make it work but they would never want to live apart for long ­periods again.'

Elsewhere Mark, recently finished his two weeks of quarantine after returning from a holiday in Spain with his wife.

Following their return he appeared to be reminiscing about their time in the sun as he posted a sweet snap of the couple to his Instagram on Sunday.
