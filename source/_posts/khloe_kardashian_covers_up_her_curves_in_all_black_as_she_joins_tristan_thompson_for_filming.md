The pair are rumored to have recently rekindled their romance, but a source recently told Us Weekly she 'doesn't really care' what people think of her love life.  

After a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship, Khloé and Tristan previously called it quits after his 2019 cheating scandal with Jordyn Woods.

In August, a source told People, 'She loves having him around. He has the best relationship with True, and he has been amazing to Khloé too. They are very much together and Khloé is beyond happy.'

'They have been living in kind of a bubble and Khloé enjoys it,' the source added.

The insider also claimed that she was 'beyond happy' and hoped 'that Tristan has changed.'

Kim announced the news on her Instagram account on Tuesday, where she wrote in a statement: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'

Kim went on to thank everyone who has been a part of the E! reality show over the years, and credited the series with 'changing [her] life forever'.

She added: 'Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience and, most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.
