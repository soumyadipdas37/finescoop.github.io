Former Offspring actor Richard Davies has welcomed his first child with his longtime partner Channelle Calderwood. 

Richard, who played Jimmy Proudman in TV comedy-drama series, and Channelle both made the announcement on their social media channels on Wednesday. 

Channelle shared an adorable photo of the infant, before writing lovingly: 'Our little slice of perfection, Freddie George Davies.'

The couple have kept the pregnancy quiet. Richard appeared in Offspring as a series regular from 2010 to 2017.  

More recently, he had a role on Netflix's Tidelands in 2018, as well as in the 2016 film 2:22, alongside Teresa Palmer.

Richard previously revealed he became an actor by accident.

The star enrolled in media studies at RMIT and had dreams of becoming a journalist. 

However, a cameo appearance in a short film led him to TV. 

'When you find something that you really love, it actually makes it pretty easy to switch careers,' he told Men's Health magazine in 2017.
