The Bachelor host Osher Günsberg had declared Thursday's finale would have 'an ending you won't believe'.

And it turns out he was very much correct - as Locky Gilbert dramatically chose Irena Srbinovska as his leading lady, leaving her love rival Bella Veralis utterly heartbroken in front of the nation. 

In a twist no one saw coming, the 30-year-old told the two ladies he had fallen in love with them both during their final dates together - leading both to believe they had won his heart.

The Bachelor 2020: Irena Srbinovska WINS Locky Gilbert's heart over rival Bella Veralis in the shocking twist no one saw coming 

A tough decision: In a twist no one saw coming, The Bachelor's Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert made the ultimate decision to start his romantic life with Irena 

But the tense episode saw the former Survivor star break down in tears as he made the heartbreaking decision to dump Bella, and start a romantic life with her rival. 

Prior to making his choice, the adventurous hunk revealed how difficult his choice had been.

 'I thought I would come here and meet one person that I like and then end up together. But I found two,' he said. 

'They are two of the most incredible women that I've ever met in my entire life.'

It's all over! On Thursday night's episode, Locky finally chose between Irena Srbinovska (left) and Bella Varelis (right)

Irena, a 31-year-old recovery nurse, has been a fan favourite to win the show for weeks - with the handsome Bachelor regularly talking about their 'special connection' and how he loved that she 'looked after' him. 

The sweet duo enjoyed multiple single dates together, with Irena eventually being the first to drop the 'bombshell' that she'd fallen for him.

But Lockie had also made it very clear he was also incredibly interested in 25-year-old Bella, stating he was charmed by her 'big brown eyes' and girl-next-door charm.

Fans were left aghast as he told both ladies how he was falling for them, just days before the grand finale.  

During the shocking episode, Locky was seen telling Irena: 'I have fallen in love with you' - before uttering the same words of adoration to Bella on their own date.

Before he made his choice, a giddy Irena declared: 'Knowing that he's in love with me... I feel confident knowing that this is the beginning of our future together.'

While Bella eagerly told producers: 'It's given me hope that everything will be alright. I mean, who tells someone they love them and then picks someone else?'
