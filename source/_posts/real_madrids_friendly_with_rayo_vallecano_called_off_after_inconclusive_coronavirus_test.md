A Rayo Vallecano player is still awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, so the second tier Spanish side's friendly against Real Madrid on Wednesday has been called off.

According to Marca, an unnamed player produced an inconclusive test, and the confirmed results will not arrive until Wednesday morning, which would be too close to the start of the match.

As an extra precaution against spreading the virus, Rayo Vallecano players took part in a socially distanced training session on Tuesday.

The second tier club's friendly match against Real Madrid on Wednesday has been called off

The friendly match, which was due to be played behind closed doors at midday on Wednesday, was set to be excellent preparation for the side who will play Mallorca this Sunday. 

Both clubs decided to call off the match on Tuesday to avoid risking the health of players and staff.  

Real Madrid still have some time to wait until their first match of the La Liga season, as they will be up against Real Sociedad on September 20.

Rayo Vallecano were relegated from La Liga in 2019, and came seventh in the Segunda Dvision last season, just missing out on a playoff spot.

In the Premier League, clubs have been warned that matches will go ahead even if their team suffers a Covid-19 outbreak, unless they have fewer than 14 players available.

There has been a spike in positive coronavirus cases, but teams will be obliged to use their under-21 squads to ensure matches can be played.
