Sam Faiers has admitted she 'didn't want to leave the house' during her two-year struggle with cystic acne.

The former TOWIE star, 29, told OK! her confidence took a huge hit after her acne flared up when she began breastfeeding her daughter Rosie, but she's finally got her skin under control with the help of collagen supplements.

Sam only revealed her battles with acne last month after weeks of hiding her flare-ups with heavy makeup and filters..

Difficult: Sam Faiers has admitted she 'didn't want to leave the house' during her two-year struggle with cystic acne

She told the magazine: 'I never wanted to leave the house. I had to put on thick foundation and when I was posing I was like ''I don't want to show this side of my face.'' 

'Some days I didn't even want to go out. When I was talking to people I thought they were all looking at my skin.

Sam added that she's overcome her skin struggles with the help of collagen supplements and she's finally comfortable with her complexion ahead of her 30th birthday later this year.

She added: 'You know what, my skin to me is now perfect. I don't have to slap on the foundation. I've tried everything but I've finally found what works for me.'

Last month Sam spoke about her struggles with cystic acne for the first time as she took to Instagram to share a snap of her bad flare-up.

In a lengthy post, Sam wrote: 'I've been really nervous about posting this picture. The last few years I've been very quiet about the fact that I've been suffering with adult acne - in my case, it was hormonal. 

'After breastfeeding Rosie, my skin just broke out and I couldn't get it under control. I tried absolutely everything. It felt like the more I was doing to stop it, the worse it became.

'I've been so embarrassed about it and have used filters on Instagram to try and hide it. I would always edit and smooth my skin in pictures and I definitely wouldn't leave the house without makeup.'

Searching for treatment, Sam said she started to use collagen skincare products for their anti-ageing qualities but 'soon noticed a dramatic reduction in breakouts along with my skin becoming firmer, lines reducing and my skin feeling more hydrated'.

The Mummy Diaries star revealed it prompted her to create her own skincare brand, Revive Collagen, which launches on Friday.
