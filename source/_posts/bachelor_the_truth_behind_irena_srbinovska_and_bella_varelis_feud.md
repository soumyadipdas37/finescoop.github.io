She didn't find love with Locky Gilbert, but Maddy Carver still left The Bachelor with great friendships with the other women in the mansion.

And on Thursday, the 25-year-old primary school teacher defended winner Irena Srbinovska's character following her feud with runner-up Bella Varelis.

Speaking to Hit Hobart's Jimmy and Nath, she praised Irena, 31, for her caring nature on set, saying: 'I honestly don't think she has a bad bone in her body.

'She was the mother of the house. She was the one that was cleaning, she was the one that was cooking,' Maddy said of Irena.

'The nights that some people didn't feel well she would be nurse Irena and she'd get out her medical kit, and she's giving people Panadol if they needed it.'

'So, no there is not a bad bone in her body and I honestly don't know where that has come from,' she added.

Caring: Maddy said of Irena (pictured), 'She was the mother of the house. She was the one that was cleaning, she was the one that was cooking... The nights that some people didn't feel well she would be nurse Irena'

Although she did not discuss Bella's qualities like she did Irena's, Maddy maintained a neutral position when asked to pick a side between the Bachelor rivals.

'I'm not usually a fence sitter, but I really like both of the girls and I get along with them both really well,' she said.

Maddy added that she had been in touch with both ladies since filming the show.

But when asked if she had contacted leading man Locky Gilbert, she bluntly replied: 'No, I have not.' 

Maddy, who was rejected by Locky after failing to receive a single date, also confirmed she was in a new relationship.

'I'm loved up now! We've known each other for about six years and went on a date six years ago,' she said of her new boyfriend.

She added: 'We didn't click at all [at first], and then we caught back up and this time something just clicked, and it just feels right.'

Maddy did not reveal the identity of her mystery man, only saying that he works as an accounts manager.
