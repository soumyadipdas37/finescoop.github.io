He professed his love for her on the season finale of The Bachelor.  

And on Tuesday, Locky Gilbert, 30, and winner Irena Srbinovska, 31, paused to drink in all the media attention that has surrounded them as they enjoyed a cup of coffee.

The loved-up couple were spotted taking a break at North Kiosk in Wollongong, just south of Sydney.

The reality stars looked happily in love with the adventure-seeking hunk putting a protective arm around the studious nurse.

Locky and Irena revealed they were planning to embark upon a road trip in NSW, before beginning a three-day drive back to Perth to move in together.  

'We just want to be together,' Locky told The Wash before Irena added their plans for the foreseeable future involved being 'on the road'. 

'Obviously, we've got out future plans, but right now we just want some alone time,' Locky told the website.  

The pair will most likely have to apply for an exemption to enter Western Australia due to the State's strict COVID-19 border restrictions.

They will then have to quarantine for two weeks at home before being able to travel freely within the State.  

On Friday, Irena explained that they are planning to live together in the same city: 'The plan is that I'm moving over to Perth,' a smiling Irena revealed on The Project.

During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told Bella Varelis and Irena that he was in love with both of them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.  

After an emotional breakup with Bella, Locky composed himself and then professed his love for Irena, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.

In a new interview with Who magazine, the happy couple revealed the codenames they used to communicate with each other while the show was airing.

'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky admitted, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.

'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.

'Douglas is Locky's middle name so that's where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.
