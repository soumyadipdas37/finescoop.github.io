The mystery surrounding Locky Gilbert's relationship status deepened on Monday, after photos surfaced of the Bachelor star with an unidentified blonde woman who isn't one of his remaining eight contestants.

Gossip website The Wash, which is run by the Matrix paparazzi agency, published images of the 31-year-old getting close to a 'female friend' at the Peach Pit bar in Scarborough, Perth, on Sunday night.

An onlooker, who claims to have spoken to Locky at the venue, said that he was 'definitely single from what I could see'.

Whats going on? The mystery surrounding Locky Gilbert's relationship status deepened on Monday, after photos surfaced of the Bachelor star with an unidentified blonde woman who isn't one of his remaining eight contestants

The source said: 'He was friendly with me, but he was with the blonde girl all night, so definitely some flirting there! He's definitely single from what I could see.' 

'I said to him, "Obviously you didn't end up with any from The Bachelor," and he looked at the blonde girl and awkwardly laughed. So I don't think he's with any of them.' 

The eyewitness account comes after The Bachelor's rumoured winner Irena Srbinovska hinted she was no longer dating the former Australian Survivor star.

On September 3, the Melbourne-based nurse liked an Instagram comment from a reality TV fan who said she was 'too good' for Locky.

'You're too good for him tho!!!' the fan wrote alongside two rose emojis. Irena was among the seven users who liked the comment.

While it wasn't conclusive evidence, the social media activity suggested that Irena and Locky had quietly split after filming the finale in July.

However, a source close to Irena, 31, later told Daily Mail Australia she had in fact liked the comment by accident.
