This is the moment a fearless subway rider leaped from one platform to another - and nailed the landing.

A young man who goes by the name 'Kiing Spiider' on social media posted a video of the death-defying feat last Wednesday, bragging 'Almost Missed My Train.'

The man wearing a black tank top, stretchy pants and sneakers took a running leap across the tracks at the Broadway Junction subway stop in Brooklyn, just as an L train was pulling into the station. 

He cleared the tracks and electrified rail, and landed on the other side with two feet to spare. The amateur stuntman then added a front flip for good measure. 

He boarded the train, took a seat, pulled off his face mask and shook his head in a display of bravado. A small crowd of spectators cheered.

The NYPD is 'aware of the incident,' a spokesperson told DailyMail.com, but there's no word whether police are actively investigating or considering an arrest. 

One police source said that while the man could technically face a charge of disorderly conduct or reckless endangerment, that's unlikely. 

He was also wearing his coronavirus mask improperly, covering his mouth but not his nose before removing it entirely. That would be a $50 fine once a new rule takes effect in MTA facilities next week.

'I think there's not much the police can do,' the source told DailyMail.com. 

'There's no longer any tools to deal with most types of crime and disorder. This idiot won't be prosecuted or punished, so why arrest him? 

'Riders will have to get more accustomed to disorderly conduct in the subways, and the train delays when the next guy doesn't stick the landing.'

Several other riders have tried but failed the jump, as the Daily Mail showed in 2015 when a man was videotaped running toward the edge of an uptown platform in Harlem, leaping into the air and missing the opposite edge by inches, causing his head and chest to smash onto the platform with a loud thud.

This week's successful stunt was posted on Instagram and Facebook, where viewers had mixed reactions.

'That was stupid. I'm sorry,' one poster wrote on Facebook. 'If he would have fell & hit the third rail, he would have been sizzling like a piece of bacon.'

'He could of really just ran up and down the stairs and would of still made it. LOL (sic),' another commented .

'If he would have missed thought, wouldn't have been so cute. LOLOLOL,' a third person wrote.
