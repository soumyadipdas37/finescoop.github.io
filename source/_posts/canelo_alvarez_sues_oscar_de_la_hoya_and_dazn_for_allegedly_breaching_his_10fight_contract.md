Boxing superstar Canelo Alvarez has filed a complaint against his promoter Oscar De La Hoya, Golden Boy Promotions and DAZN, according to reports.

The 30-year-old Mexican made the move on Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court - alleging that there was a breach of contract.

According to The Athletic, Alvarez is at war with his promoter and the streaming service, DAZN, over his multi-million 10-fight boxing contract.

Back in October 2018, Alvarez put pen to paper on a a 10-fight deal worth $350million (£270m) with DAZN but just two bouts into that contract - he is at odds with both the streaming service and De La Hoya over payment of his set $35m (£27m) per contest.

'I'm the pound-for-pound No. 1 in the world,' Alvarez said in a statement to The Athletic. 

'I'm not scared of any opponent in the ring, and I'm not going to let failures of my broadcaster or promoters keep me out of the ring.

'I filed the lawsuit so I can get back to boxing and give my fans the show they deserve.' 

It has been reported that DAZN have already been reluctant to pay Alvarez his full fight purse after just two bouts - instead offering him roughly half as much.

The streaming service argue that four-weight world champion Alvarez has failed to seal a mega-fight with one of boxing's biggest opponents.

They have been digging in their heels over Golden Boy's failure to deliver a money-spinning trilogy fight with Gennady Golovkin. 

But after rejecting DAZN's offer of half the fight purse, he subsequently turned to Golden Boy to find a new broadcaster to deal with.

However, it has been alleged that his promoter failed to negotiate a new deal and are now part of the lawsuit as well.

Alvarez is also looking for damages at a minimum of $280m (£216m). 

Almost two years ago, Alvarez penned a 10-fight deal with DAZN worth $350million (£270m)
