A law firm is weighing legal action against 12 more insurers over failing to pay out business interruption claims to small companies. 

Mishcon de Reya, which is already representing policyholders against Hiscox, is considering whether to bring proceedings against Allianz, AIG, Aspen, Aviva, Axa, Chubb, Liberty, MS Amlin, Protector, RSA, QBE and Zurich. 

Fight: Mishcon de Reya is already representing policyholders against Hiscox in the Covid claims

It follows a High Court ruling that companies forced to close during lockdown should be able to claim under most business interruption policies which mention an outbreak of a disease. 

Mishcon says the judgement means policies including 'resilience' wording will have to pay. Some firms have declined to do so.
