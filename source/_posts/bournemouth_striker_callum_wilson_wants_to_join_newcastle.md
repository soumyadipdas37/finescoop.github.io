Callum Wilson is waiting for Bournemouth and Newcastle to agree a deal on his proposed move to St James’ Park, with Steve Bruce’s need for signings greater than ever after a 5-1 drubbing at Middlesbrough.

Newcastle’s pre-season is turning into a nightmare for the head coach with serious injuries to goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and striker Dwight Gayle followed by Tuesday’s heavy loss at Championship side Boro.

Magpies captain Jamaal Lascelles and home midfielder Lewis Wing were sent off following an off-the-ball altercation but they will avoid a suspension in the regular season, instead missing Monday’s rematch between the teams on Tyneside.

Callum Wilson has interest from several clubs but his preferred destination is Newcastle

Steve Bruce is keen to bring in fresh faces after his side lost 5-1 to Middlesbrough on Tuesday

By that point Bruce will be hoping to have 28-year-old Wilson on board, so desperate is he for strikers.

Sources close to Bournemouth say they are still waiting for an official approach from Newcastle, but expect that an offer is incoming.

A swap deal involving Matt Ritchie plus cash for Wilson has been mooted but insiders say Bournemouth, despite their relegation, will not be selling at a reduced rate, evidenced by the £41million it cost Manchester City to sign Nathan Ake and the £18.5m Sheffield United paid for Aaron Ramsdale.

Andy Carroll remains the only forward available to Bruce and it will be a concern that his side played the opening hour at Boro without a recognised frontman.

However, we understand Newcastle is Wilson’s preferred destination and sources are hopeful of movement in the next 48 hours.

Meanwhile, we have been told that Gayle has damaged his medial collateral ligaments and will see a specialist on Wednesday ahead of an operation and rehab period. Sources say he will be missing for anywhere between eight and 12 weeks following surgery.

Newcastle have also been in talks with former Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser, who is now a free agent.
