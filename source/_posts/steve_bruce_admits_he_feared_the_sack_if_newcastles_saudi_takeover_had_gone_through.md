Steve Bruce says he expected the sack had Newcastle United's Saudi-led takeover gone through.

The head coach admits he spent the final weeks of the season believing his days were numbered at St James' Park.

But the £300million deal collapsed at the end of July and Bruce remains in charge, unveiling £35million's worth of signings in the form of Callum Wilson, Jamal Lewis and Ryan Fraser on Wednesday.

'A new brush always sweeps clean, so I was under no illusions of what might be coming,' said Bruce as he spoke for the first time following the Saudi withdrawal.

'There was nothing I could influence. But I always said, whatever is best for the club, I would go along with. If that meant a takeover and I wasn't here, then I was always of that mindset.

'Once it was knocked on its head it was like, "Right, I have to get my head back on that we're going back to work". I had to work out how we could improve and go forward.'

Bruce, who has also added Jeff Hendrick to his squad, said: 'I'm certain with the signings we've made we've taken it on. I'm delighted we've been able to do that, because maybe people didn't think we could.

'We must never underestimate what a great club we have, that was the key with Callum. Yes, we had to flex our muscles and had to beat off Aston Villa, but the kid wanted to play here.

'Ryan had six or seven choices. He wanted to play here. It is still classed as a really great club to play for.

'Signings help supporters, managers, coaches, players - and we've had four or them. The place is happy again - until next week!

'But it's been a good week and we're delighted to get them. It's been hard work. The four major ones we've brought in will certainly improve us.

'I know we need to hit the ground running, and that's the most important thing.'
