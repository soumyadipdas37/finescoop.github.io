Giuliana Rancic has revealed she will not be participating in this year's Emmy festivities after she and her entire family tested positive for coronavirus.

The awards show regular mainstay, 46, shared the news during E!'s Live From the Red Carpet: The 2020 Emmy Awards show on Sunday.

She told fans: 'Hey, everyone. As I go into my 20th year on the E! red carpet I have to say I do not take missing an award show lightly, but unfortunately this year is just so different.'

Now as much as I didn't want to hear that, I'm very thankful I heard it before I traveled and possibly could have exposed other people. So for that, I'm thankful.'
