Brian Austin Green's tattooed 'girlfriend' Tina Louise has clapped back at haters who complained she was showing too much of her body.

During an Instagram Q&A on Wednesday, the Australian model was told to cover up, and one troll even asked: 'Why do you need to show your body that much?'

Tina, 39, responded by sharing a photo of herself in a racy swimsuit, which drew attention to her sensational curves and pert derrière.

'Does it offend you that I'm confident and comfortable with my sexuality?' she wrote.

Tina has gone from social media star to bona fide celebrity since her fling with the Beverly Hills, 90210 actor made headlines in July.

Tina, who boasts 2.4 million followers on Instagram platform, was most recently spotted with Brian at the beach in Los Angeles on Monday.

The father of four, who is separated from wife Megan Fox, was unable to take his eyes off the bombshell.

He had reportedly split with Tina at the end of July after a month of dating, only for them to reconcile weeks later.

It comes just days after Brian told his Instagram followers he would 'never say never' to getting back with Megan.

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he said during a livestream on Saturday.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'

Meghan started dating rapper Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker,  less than a month after her split with Brian.
