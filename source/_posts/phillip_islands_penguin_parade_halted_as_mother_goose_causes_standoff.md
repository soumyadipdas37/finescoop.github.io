A standoff between Phillip Island's iconic fairy penguins and a stubborn mother goose has been captured on camera.

The Live Penguin TV livestream recorded the Cape Barren goose and her two goslings blocking the Penguin Parade pathway on on Sunday night.

Following almost 10 minutes of chest pouting, the defiant mother goose eventually conceded defeat in the stand-off, allowing the rattled penguins to pass in numbers.

The footage then showed a disappointed goose move on, with her two goslings in tow. 

Phillip Island Ranger Skye Nichol described the scene as 'quite a stand off.'

'One penguin went to pass and the Mumma Goose said no,' she told the Bass Coast News.

 'She was quite fiesty as she was protecting her babies.'

The adorable waddling penguins at Phillip Island have long been a must-see attraction for visitors at one of Australia's premier tourist destinations in Victoria. 

From 6.30pm every night (AEST), a livestream of the penguins making their way home from the beach has been a massive hit on Facebook and YouTube.

More than 771,000 viewers tuned in for the online launch back on August 25.
