Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska are now officially out of hiding after the Bachelor finale on Thursday night.

And on Friday, the loved-up couple shared a passionate kiss on their first outing after the show's finale.

The pair glanced into each other's eyes before Irena, 31, pulled Locky, 31, in close for a kiss before enjoying a romantic dinner in Sydney.

'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.

'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.' 

Moments earlier, he had delivered the bad news to runner-up Bella Varelis - despite having told her beforehand that he was 'falling in love' with her.

In an interview with Who magazine on Friday, the couple revealed the codenames they used to communicate with each other while the show was airing.   

'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky said, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.

'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.  

'Douglas is Locky's middle name so that's where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.
