They're different faces but they all share the same horror story.

Women, from all walks of life, professions and cities, who have had the misfortune of crossing paths with handsome IT worker Thomas McGuirk – a vile Tinder creep who can't take 'no' for an answer.

Six more women came forward to Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday to share their experiences with the 28-year-old Bondi 'playboy' – and their stories are eerily familiar.

What starts as a cheesy pick-up line quickly turns to crude sexual advances and badgering insistence they meet to hook up.

But when this doesn't happen - for whatever reason – he suddenly snaps.

McGuirk is the Jekyll and Hyde of Tinder – and the abuse he levels at the women is sickening. 

McGuirk has been outed for sending degrading and abusive messages to women along the east coast of Australia

From Newcastle to Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney, victims have shared their horror stories with McGuirk. As one of the women put it: 'It looks like he's taking his bullsh*t on a national tour'

Ebonie Sanderson and Erin Hinds, both 26, were the first two women to publicly shame McGuirk for sending them abusive messages after they refused his sexual advances.

But in the days to follow, the accusations have piled up and some of his victims fear there could be dozens more.  

From Newcastle to Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney, a growing number of women have shared their MGuirk horror stories.

As one of the victims put it: 'It looks like he's taking his bullsh*t on a national tour'.  

Six more women all told Daily Mail Australia they'd come into contact with McGuirk in the last 18 months and believed the vile treatment they received were isolated incidents before Ms Sanderson outed him as a Tinder pest last week. 

Here are their stories: 

Tech worker Thomas McGuirk, 28, was sacked from his job after sending disgusting abuse to at least seven women he  met on Tinder after they refused to meet him





Jess Turunen, Beauty Vlogger and Empowerment Coach on the Gold Coast

Beauty vlogger Jess Turunen matched with McGuirk in May 2020 on the Gold Coast.

She told Daily Mail Australia they got along well for a few days, but some of his opinions made her uncomfortable.

McGuirk called her 'white trash' after he learned that her ex-boyfriend was black, and said he was disappointed that she would sleep with someone of a different race.

'After a few days he began asking what my type was and I explained that I really don't have one. My ex-husband was a redhead and my last partner was black,' she said.

'Immediately Tom said he doesn't date women who have slept with black people... I thought he was joking, but he wasn't.'

When she realised just how serious McGuirk was, Ms Turunen suggested he seek a girlfriend elsewhere.

'I suggested a KKK meeting... He didn't like that, was telling me I was trash and disgusting.' 

Even though she never met him, Ms Turunen was harassed by McGuirk both on Tinder and later on Instagram after he found her account.   

'I was quite traumatised by it all,' she said. 

'I'm glad he's been called out because its frankly not fair.'

Chantelle Robinson, 26, Woolworths Manager on the Gold Coast

Chantelle Robinson, a 26-year-old from the Gold Coast, matched with McGuirk on Tinder back in early 2019.

At the time, the IT worker was in Queensland and trying to line up dates with women all along the coast, and told Ms Robinson he wouldn't normally 'go for a girl like you'.

The Woolworths manager told Daily Mail Australia McGuirk was arrogant from the outset, and told her she was 'beneath him anyway' after she declined his invitation to meet up.

'I lived with my disabled mother and brother at the time... So I told him he couldn't come over and he absolutely lost it at me,' she said.

'He said I was beneath him anyway and that he was glad he didn't see me because I'm ''retarded like my family''.' 

Ms Robinson also revealed the high opinion McGuirk had of himself at the time, insisting that he was 'so good looking he could get any girl he wanted'. 

While Ms Robinson had never even met him, she said the encounter brought her to tears. 

'He's a terrible person... When I saw his face pop up on Facebook yesterday I was like ''ugh, that guy''. I wish I'd said something sooner.'

Hem Mason, 29, Makeup Artist from Melbourne

Melbourne makeup artist Hem Mason, 29, matched with McGuirk on Hinge on May 17 while temporarily based in the Gold Coast after returning from overseas.

The tech worker instantly bombarded her with inappropriate questions about her sexual experiences.

'I got a prediction from reading your bio. You're into black dudes,' McGuirk wrote.

'And you got with more black dudes than white dudes while you were in London.'

Ms Mason confronted him over his rude probing, asking 'why he would ask how many people she had slept with at all?'

But he doubled down, responding: 'Why is it so hard to answer?'.

Sick of engaging with his rude questioning, she unmatched with his profile.

'I was shocked that someone thought it was not only appropriate to ask about my sexual history in their very first message to me, but also the inferred objectification of black men,' Ms Mason told Daily Mail Australia.

'I knew he was trying to lead me into a trap where he could say something even more inappropriate or straight up sexually aggressive.'

Ms Mason said she was outraged and shocked that people think it is okay to speak to others disrespectfully online.

'I was disgusted, angry, frustrated and exhausted that this kind of behaviour is so common not just on dating apps, but on social media in general.'

Jennifer, 29, Disability worker in Newcastle 

Jennifer*, a 29-year-old disability worker and business owner from Newcastle, matched with McGuirk on Tinder in July.

He sent her a brazen message which read 'you look naughty' to initiate the conversation, but Jennifer was far from impressed.

 'Hi would have been a better start,' she responded, only to receive a second message from McGuirk calling her 'ugly'.

She blocked him on Tinder, but like so many of the other victims, he found her Instagram account and continued with the abuse.   

McGuirk's insults triggered a depressive episode, and for the sake of her mental health, Jennifer decided not to read the remarks he sent via Instagram.

'The response I got after turning him down, with him calling me ugly, saying I'm only suitable for one thing etc, made me feel as though I was nothing,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Sometimes you lose hope in people's character and almost get used to the remarks.'

'I work with young peoples mental health all the time and teach about the impact of words and how important self love and positive thinking is for our well being, yet when it was me being triggered it was very hard to remember those words I had given others.

'I questioned whether maybe I wasn't actually attractive, or good enough. But soon after I reminded myself that my worth is not dictated by some a******e's opinion.'

Jennifer said it had been comforting to know she was not alone as multiple women came forward with similar stories.

Nikki Ferris, former Bachelor contestant from Sydney 

Nikki Ferris, a contestant on the seventh season of The Bachelor, also described McGuirk as 'disgusting' after sharing an insulting message he sent her. 

The reality TV star matched with him on Tinder and sent him a flirty pick up line which read: 'Tell me are you Israeli? Because you Israeli hot'.

But his harsh response left her stunned and upset.

'You are just tits, ass and puns, huh,' Mr McGuirk wrote back. 

Ms Ferris shared her experience online and said she found him 'actually disgusting' after learning of other women's experiences with the IT worker.

Sam in Brisbane 

Sam matched with McGuirk two days before her birthday in June 2020, while she was staying in Southbank in Brisbane. 

McGuirk told her he lived nearby and immediately started 'sexting' her and invited her to his house. 

Initially, she was flattered by his determination and agreed to meet with him the next day, but had to reschedule when her sisters arrived in town to surprise her for her birthday.

'I messaged him to reschedule. Not cancel, reschedule,' she explained. 'And he went mental, telling me my sisters were a dumb reason and to tell them that I'd be back in an hour.'

Even as he abused her, Sam said she tried to explain that she'd still visit him another day, but eventually tired of the abusive messages and told him he was being 'possessive, clingy and that it was a massive red flag'.

'I blocked him before he had a chance to reply... He was the first person I'd spoken to after a huge break up and I just deleted the app after that. I have no plans to get back on it because of how badly it went.'       

Miss Smith, Mining Administrator in Newcastle

A mining administrator from Newcastle who wished to be identified as Miss Smith matched with McGuirk on Tinder on August 3.

Although he was in Sydney at the time, McGuirk told her he would be travelling to Newcastle the following day for work.

The conversation started with small talk before McGuirk suggested they meet up when he arrived.

Miss Smith told him she was not interested in a one night stand, at which point he tried to persuade her by insisting it could become an 'ongoing thing'.

She declined the offer and the exchange eventually fizzled out, with McGuirk suggesting they 'see what happens' on his trip.

The next day he messaged again to tell her he was in the city, and Miss Smith reiterated she did not want to meet him for sex. 

'He started to belittle me, saying I was dumb and my IQ was low, and he only hooks up with intelligent women,' Miss Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

'He just keep going on with the insults, so I didn't respond and I just deleted him... I could see he was still typing as I was deleting him.'

Miss Smith thought her awful encounter had ended, but McGuirk wanted to have the last word.

Four hours later he tracked her down on Instagram and the abuse kicked off again.

'Cya you silly s**t hahah,' Mr McGuirk wrote her.

'P.S you have an ugly face. Your droopy eyes reflect your IQ. Enjoy the Mustang you old bogan s**t.'

While she never responded to the message, Miss Smith said she was surprised at how quickly the conversation escalated into insults after she rejected his advances.

'After I deleted him from Tinder I just thought he'd move onto the next girl because he bragged that he had no issues hooking up with other girls.'

'I just narrowed it down to this guy being crazy. I was glad I never agreed to meet up with him in person.

Miss Smith said she was inspired to speak out after learning of other girls' experiences with McGuirk.

'I didn't think to much of it but after hearing other girls' stories I am very concerned that there is someone out there like this still. What does he have to gain from threatening women like this?'

Erin Hinds, 26, Brewery Supervisor in Sydney

Erin Hinds spent the night with McGuirk after matching with him on Tinder, and said he was pleasant up until the moment she told him she was not interested in pursuing anything further.   

'I said sorry, I have changed my mind. It was fun but we really don't have chemistry. That is when he flipped the switch,' the brewery supervisor from Sydney told Daily Mail Australia.

'He went crazy.'

'He started calling me a w***e and a s**t then taking pictures of my friends from social media and sending them to me saying that we are all retards, disgusting w****s with bad dental hygiene, and s***ts only worth one f**k each.' 

Ms Hind said he went on to target her friends and threaten to stalk her at work before contacting some of her friends and asking for her home address. 

Terrified, she quickly blocked him on all of her social media accounts.

The next day, she matched with a guy called 'Ryan' on Tinder, who later claimed he was a friend of McGuirk and the pair had a good laugh at her expense.

'He said he remembered where I worked and threatened to come in,' Ms Hinds said. 

In messages provided to Daily Mail Australia, 'Ryan' told Ms Hinds that he and McGuirk expected 'excellent customer service', to remember to 'smile' and that 'customers are always right'.

Ms Hinds said the altercation left her fearing for her safety and that she is now too terrified to go on another Tinder date.

Ebonie Sanderson was the first woman to speak publicly about the abuse she received from McGuirk. 

She said after they had arranged to meet up on Tinder, she became uncomfortable with his behavior and called the date off, leading to a torrent of abuse.    

'Then all these voice messages came through, just abusive messages about my appearance, and my weight,' she said. 

McGuirk bizarrely claimed to have 'better genes' that she knew 'deep down' made him 'above' her.

'The fat liberal arts chick... teach me. I know you know deep down you are below me, that there is hierarchy in society,' he wrote.

'And the dysgenic like you are there to serve us. You are the inferiors.'

After sending the abusive messages, McGuirk called Ms Sanderson to abuse her for 'wasting his time' and calling her a 'fat f**king pig'.  

'You're f***ing ugly. Your a** looks OKAY and you would have been one f***. You would have been just one f*** because you're a disgusting fat pig.' 

'Look at my f***ing face. I don't have to struggle to get laid. I especially don't need a FOUR like you to get laid.'

Ms Sanderson blocked him on Snapchat and Instagram, but he added her another account and continued messaging her.
