It's confirmed! The Bachelorette will be returning to screens in just two weeks' time. 

The brand new season - which will show sisters Elly and Becky Miles on their journey to find love - will kick off on Wednesday, October 7 at 7:30pm on Channel 10.

The network announced the launch date on Thursday evening.

It's back! Host Osher Günsberg made the announcement in a video shared to the Bachelorette's social media channel

Host Osher Günsberg made the announcement in a video shared to the Bachelorette's social media channel, at the same time Locky Gilbert's series of the Bachelor came to a close.

'It's going to be great!' he promised in the short clip. 

The announcement comes just days after a brand new trailer appeared online for the new season - which is the first-ever to feature two sibling Bachelorettes.  

And judging from the footage, it's clear there are early contenders for the gorgeous siblings' hearts. 

Elly, 25, and Becky, 30, started by saying how delighted they are to be on their quest to find Mr Right together.

'I want to find love next to you. It will be magical,' Becky tells her sister, who beams as she agrees. 

They then meet the men, one by one, with fellows called Pete, Sarge, Frazer and Rudy introducing themselves.

The last man to come in was a familiar face, with Elly freaking out when she saw him, and the man was equally shocked.  

'No way it's a small world!' he cried out as he approached the sisters with a stunned look on his face.
