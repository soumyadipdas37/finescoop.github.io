Two fishermen who went missing off the South Australian coast six days ago have miraculously been found alive after a major search operation. 

Derek Robinson and Tony Higgins vanished during a trip to Goolwa, from Coffin Bay near Port Lincoln on Thursday, September 3. 

They were just a day into their trip when they experienced engine trouble. 

The pair managed to contact a friend to inform them their plans had changed and they would be diverting to nearby Kangaroo Island.

But they had not been heard from since. 

A massive search operation was sparked, involving police, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and members of the Royal Australian Air Force. 

The crews spent days searching an area larger than Tasmania covered in an attempt to find the men.

Hours after aerial search was called off the men managed raise the alarm. 

They are floating in Salt Creek, south-east of Goolwa, awaiting rescue crews.
