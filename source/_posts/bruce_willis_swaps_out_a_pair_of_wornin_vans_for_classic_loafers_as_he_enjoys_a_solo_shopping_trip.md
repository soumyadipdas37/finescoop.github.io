He spent lockdown in a rather unconventional quarantine with his ex-wife Demi Moore and their three adult daughters in Idaho. 

But Bruce Willis was flying solo as he headed out shoe shopping in Beverly Hills on Wednesday.  

The Die Hard star, 65, swapped out a pair of worn-in Vans for a pair of smart brown leather loafers while enjoying a spot of retail therapy in Benheart.  

Shop 'til you drop: Bruce Willis was flying solo as he headed out shoe shopping in Beverly Hills on Wednesday 

For a smart-casual look, the actor wore a pirate-motif face mask and paisley bandana, teamed with his deep navy T-shirt and distressed blue jeans. 

The action star accessorised the look with a classic black baseball cap as he shopped during the September sun. 

Bruce grabbed a coffee from a nearby store as he enjoyed a caffeine fix after his shoe-shopping trip. 

The actor's silver wedding band gleamed in the sun after recently celebrating his 11-year wedding anniversary with loving wife and model Emma Heming, 41. 

That's shoe-business: The Die Hard star, 65, swapped out a pair of worn-in Vans for a pair of smart brown leather loafers while enjoying a spot of retail therapy in Benheart 

The couple share two children together, daughters Evelyn Penn, eight, and Maybel Ray, six. 

Bruce has three daughters from his previous marriage to ex-wife Demi Moore, 55, - Rumer, 30, Scout, 27 amd Tallulah, 24. 

The actor Bruce was visiting his ex and adult daughters when he got stuck at Demi's Sun Valley, Idaho, residence after lockdowns swept across the states and travel earlier this year. 

During that time, Emma stayed with their daughters Mabel and Evelyn - but eventually they were able to fly to Idaho to join Bruce in May. 

'Demi and Emma are close, and all three get on great as a big blended family,' an insider told People at the time. 'There are no issues at all. Emma needed to stay in L.A. with the young kids.'  

Bruce's latest thriller Survive the Night dropped on Amazon Prime last month, directed by Matt Eskandari and Doug Wolfe.

It tells the tale of a disgraced doctor - played by the actor - and his family who are held hostage in their home by criminals on the run. 

He stars alongside Chad Michael Murray and Shea Buckner in the gripping thriller, which puts his character's morals into question after a robbery-gone-awry requires  his captures to seek immediate medical attention.
