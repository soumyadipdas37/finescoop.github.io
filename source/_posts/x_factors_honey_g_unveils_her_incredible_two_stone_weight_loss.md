X Factor star Honey G has unveiled her impressive two stone weight loss after overhauling her fitness regime in lockdown.

The singer, 39, showed off her incredible new look after recently completing a charity triathlon, and admitted she'd done more exercise in lockdown than she had 'in her whole life.'

Honey G rose to prominence when she competed on The X Factor in 2016, and left viewers divided with her eye-catching performance style.

Honey G - real name Anna Georgette Gilford - recently shared a glimpse of her new physique in a skintight leotard after completing a triathlon, which consisted of a 750m swim, 20km cycle and a 5km run.

She told The Daily Star that after struggling to commit to a diet, she decided to overhaul her fitness regime during lockdown after failing to maintain her previous weight loss.

Honey has embraced virtual spinning classes, running and open-water swimming sessions to help her shed two stone, along with Hatha Yoga classes.

She explained: 'Lockdown has proved to me that doing lots of exercise can make you lose weight.

'I went to see a top obesity specialist and a dietician in the past and I was trying to lose weight by changing my diet but during lockdown I combined changing my diet and doing a large amount of exercise.

'I've been probably doing more exercise in lockdown than I have in my whole life.'

Back in 2018, Honey revealed she'd lost a stone in two months after embracing a low-carb diet.

Speaking to The Sun, the rapper admitted she's been desperate to lose weight for a 'really long time,' and has already started to see a difference on her stomach and legs.

'One day hopefully I’ll be able to put a bikini hopefully,' she said. 'At the moment I still don't feel like I can wear a bikini because I’m not confident enough.

'But I still thinner than I was and I feel more confident in my body and when I'm walking around, getting in the pool, getting out of the pool.'

Back in 2018, Honey revealed that she decided to ditch her musical persona and pursue a career as an estate agent.

But weeks later, she announced she'd been fired from her new job for being 'too famous.'

She told The Sun: 'They didn’t realise how famous I am... My boss had told me that he was expecting me to give up my music career, which I am obviously not prepared to do.

'Music is my love and passion, and my ambitions are about being a worldwide music artist. I had no intention of being an estate agent long term. I was hoping that a big opportunity for my music career would come in. I do believe I belong on stage.'
