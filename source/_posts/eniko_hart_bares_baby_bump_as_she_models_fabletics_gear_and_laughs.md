She is expecting her second baby by her husband Kevin Hart.

And Eniko Hart showed off her baby bump in cut-off Fabletics workout gear while advertising the clothing on Insta Stories Friday.

The 36-year-old said with a small laugh: 'I can’t wait to drop this belly so I can wear these comfortably but I just had to show you this color.'

Eniko is a busy ambassador for Fabletics, which movie star Kate Hudson co-founded with Don Ressler and Adam Goldenberg. 

She posed up a storm in a set of mustard-toned clothing from Fabletics, turning so that her followers could get a look at the outfit from several angles.

'Hey, guys, so it’s time for some unboxing for September. I know it’s been awhile but I have to show you all this amazing color that I’m absolutely loving,' she dished. 

'This mustard is so dope. These leggings are the high-waisted PureLuxe minimal legging. I love it ‘cause it’s really kinda seamless – like you can look at the back, there’s no lines. It literally like sculpts the body, which I am dying for,' said she.

'And then the top is the Noelle SculptKnit bra – these are still like my favorite. There’s not much support, but there, it’s just comfy and I love that,' Eniko shared.

'It feels really light and the back looks like this,' said the soon-to-be mother of two as she turned to show off the top from behind.

'Yeah, I’m feeling this color. I can’t wait to drop this belly so I can wear these comfortably but I just had to show you this color,' she dished.

She and Kevin announced the sex of the baby via Instagram on Mother's Day, telling the world they are about to welcome a baby girl.

Eniko and Kevin married in 2016 and share a two-year-old son called Kenzo, whom she was pregnant with when her husband cheated on her.

A couple of years on from the adultery scandal Eniko shared on the Netflix docu-series Kevin Hart: Don't F*** This Up that she has put the matter behind her.
