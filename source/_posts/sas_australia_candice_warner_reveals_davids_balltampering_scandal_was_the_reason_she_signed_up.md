She's all set to appear on Channel Seven's SAS: Australia. 

And on Sunday, Candice Warner revealed why she decided to take part in the gruelling new challenge show. 

In a new trailer, the 35-year-old admits she wants her children to think 'it's not just daddy who is tough and strong,' citing her husband David's infamous ball-tampering scandal as the reason she joined the all-star line-up.

 'There was a ball-tampering incident. My two kids having to face that media was shocking,' the former Ironwoman said. 

'The hardest thing for me was being told that I was a really bad mother.'

She added: 'I'm doing this for my family. To show my kids that it's not just daddy who is tough and strong.' 

It has been a difficult period for Candice - who gave birth to her third child, Isla, in July - after she suffered two miscarriages in 15 months since David's cheating incident in Cape Town in March 2018.

In an interview with Stellar last October, Candice reflected on the dark period her family faced - saying there were times her husband struggled to even get out of bed.

'Looking back, it was a very horrific time,' she told the publication. 'We had two miscarriages. It definitely took a toll on my body. It was heartbreaking. I thought, 'What more can be taken from me?'

Candice made the decision to be the 'strength and rock' for her husband and their children, after David was hit with a ban from the sport for a year for his role in the ball-tampering ordeal.

Rather than hide away in shame, the model was determined to 'power on' through the trauma, and get her husband back into fitness and into a routine.

David, former Australian captain Steve Smith and player Cameron Bancroft were slapped with bans for conspiring to cheat against South Africa in March 2018 by rubbing the ball with sandpaper.

David's 12-month ban has since ended, and he was selected for Australia's preliminary squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

Candice decided to look at the positive aspects of Warner's ban - in that his doting daughters could have an abundance of 'daddy time' with their father.

'David and I now look at each other and say, 'How did we get through that?',' she added. 'But we did. We now know for sure that nothing will ever break us.'
