West Ham supporters were left hugely alarmed on Wednesday after co-owner David Sullivan warned that the club aren't guaranteed to make any new signings.

The Hammers have endured a summer of discontent and the pressure has intensified once again on the owners after seeing no fresh faces walk through the door while they sold highly-rated Grady Diangana to West Brom for £20million. 

Fans have been furious with the direction West Ham are going in - some supporters have supported the GSB (Gold, Sullivan, Brady) Out campaign, with a small group of protestors unfurling anti-ownership banners outside the ground before kick-off against Newcastle on the opening day of the season.

And on Wednesday, Sullivan told talkSPORT that the transfer market leaves him 'depressed' while claiming he can't bring in the players that manager David Moyes is looking for.

Sullivan revealed: 'It's the manager's decision. He doesn't want to bring in players who are just numbers, just squad players. He wants to bring players in who will improve the team.

'We have a number of bids in for a number if players, but teams don't want to lose them; these are key players at decent sized clubs, outside the UK. They don't want to lose them so whether we get any of these players I do not know.'

West Ham have been heavily linked with James Tarkowski from Burnley but they have struggled in their pursuit while they have interest in Juventus' Daniele Rugani.

Meanwhile, they have lost out on both Eberechi Eze and Ryan Fraser to Premier League rivals Crystal Palace and Newcastle respectively. 

It has been a turbulent summer at West Ham with the club unable to bring in any fresh faces

He continued: 'We've got a very unbalanced squad. We've now got the funds to buy a player or two, but unfortunately at the moment the players the manager wants we can't get, and he'll be spending 18 hours a day looking at types trying to find players.

'I'm waiting for targets for the manager and we've got two or three bids in, but unfortunately the benchmark is very high and it's very hard to get those players.'

Sullivan finally added: 'I can't just go and sign two or three players the manager doesn't want. I could quite easily tomorrow go and sign two or three players but we'd have a civil war at West Ham, because I don't pick the players. 

'We have a manager who is a manager, not a coach; if he was a coach I could do that, but that's not the way it works at West Ham – the managers pick the teams.

'I cannot say for sure we are going to sign anybody. As each day passes, I get more depressed.'
