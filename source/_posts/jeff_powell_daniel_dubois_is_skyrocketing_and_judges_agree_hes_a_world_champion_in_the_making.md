The sky-rocketing rise of Daniel Dubois towards a world heavyweight title challenge has been boosted further by his launching into the top ten of the WBC rankings.

This recognition for the hottest prospect in boxing's marquee division comes at a time when the heavyweight ratings by the major sanctioning bodies are in a more diverse state of flux than for many a year.

Dynamite Daniel had already been promoted from nowhere to No 3 by the WBO.

If that was a mite premature for a 22-year-old after only 15 fights - albeit every one a victory and all but one by knock-out - his elevation to eighth by the highly respected WBC brings serious credibility to claims that he will be a threat to the established order of Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder as early as next summer.

Dubois has shot up the rankings, now deemed eighth by the highly respected WBC

Promoter Frank Warren has no doubts, saying: 'Daniel against Joshua would be a great fight right now and actually I would give him the edge. Next year he will be more than ready.' 

There can be no doubt that Dubois is one of the most lethal punchers in the ring today, that power reinforced by a concrete chin.

Those gifts have made it scarily difficult for his opponents thus far to survive enough rounds to give him the experience any young fighter needs.

Hopefully some of that will come with his British championship defence against silver Olympian Joe Joyce which is scheduled for London's 02 on October 24, coronavirus permitting.

Even before that, he is shaking up the rankings. The extent of which is evident in the conflicting alpha-belt tables compiled below, as well as the Ring magazine assessment.

Personally, I also place Dubois seventh.

What most judges do agree upon is that this obsessively dedicated south Londoner with the sledgehammer fists is the young man is a world champion in the making.
