The public may be denied a thrilling climax to the Wag-atha Christie saga after rival WAGs Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy agreed to try to settle their feud.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal they will take part in a so-called ‘meaning hearing’ at which a judge will rule on precisely what Mrs Rooney meant when she wrote on social media that it had been Mrs Vardy’s Instagram account leaking stories to a red-top newspaper.

The final four words of Mrs Rooney’s dramatic post in October said: ‘It’s... Rebekah Vardy’s account.’ The two women – wives of footballers Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy – disagree on whether the words infer that Ms Vardy, who has denied leaking any information, was personally involved or not.

Coleen Rooney was dubbed 'Wag-atha Christie' after the series of tweets 

The development means Mrs Rooney, 34, will not be required to file a response to legal papers submitted by Mrs Vardy in July – and reduces the chances of a potentially bitter court battle being played out in public.

‘The thought of their dirty laundry being aired in public is not something either of the women want, but equally neither would back down,’ said a source.

‘So they have both agreed, jointly, that this would be a sensible way forward.

‘Establishing exactly what the accusation means will mean that the circus that surrounds it won’t have to happen.’ The source added: ‘They both hope it can put an end to what has been quite a distraction for them both.’

Insiders believe the judge’s decision will lead to a settlement of the feud which has seen Mrs Rooney hire celebrity barrister David Sherborne and 38-year-old Ms Vardy allege that the accusations caused her physical and mental anguish, including ‘severe panic attacks and anxiety’.

The spokesmen for Mrs Rooney and Mrs Vardy did not respond to requests for comment.
