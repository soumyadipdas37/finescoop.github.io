The intricacies of life in an early Victorian village have been depicted in the oldest ever photographs of southern England - with the album set to fetch up to £70,000 at auction.

Images of flower girls, portraits of soldiers and stills of a brass band performing in West Sussex were all captured by a technique developed by Captain Thomas Honywood in a 'historically important' and 'breathtaking' collection. 

The earliest of the extraordinary images is a rural farm scene with a man standing by a fence from 1848 with another shot, a group of men and boys in a study captioned 'Horsham Woodcutters', dating from 1850. 

It is unclear where many of the landscape images were taken or who the people pictured were, as many of the buildings photographed no longer exist. 

Captain Honywood was responsible for the invention of Nature Printing, which enabled him to transfer positive images onto film. His discovery came around a decade after William Henry Fox Talbot created the first reasonably light-fast and permanent photograph.

His images painted an astonishing image of England in the 1840s and 50s, when Queen Victoria governed over Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of India, South America and Africa in an ever-expanding British Empire. 

The period also marked the height of Britain's Industrial Revolution, with Prince Albert's Great Exhibition opening in London's Crystal Palace in May 1851. Here, around 10,000 exhibitors displayed innovative technology, including farm machinery and false teeth, to the awe of around six million visitors.

But life was less than idyllic for those living in rural villages, where in the 1840s a series of poor harvests heralded what became known as the Hungry Forties - with the worst famine taking place in Ireland during the four-year Great Hunger from September 1845.  

Archaeologist Captain Honywood, whose images display this period in great detail, experimented with a range of photo-chemical processes that he used to capture life in West Sussex and print them in a 19th century leather-bound album.

He was able to patent this innovative photography technique, and he exhibited it at the London International Inventions Exhibition of 1885. 

The extraordinary album will be sold on October 28 by Chiswick Auctions, who are anticipating a great deal of interest from museums and collectors with an estimated selling price of up to £70,000.    

Austin Farahar, Head of Photographica at Chiswick Auctions, said: 'The album has a narrative similar to any great artist's sketchbook, full of experimentation, development and adjustments.

'It is fascinating to observe how the polymath Thomas Honywood was utilising and learning the new photographic artform. Many of the works contained within are simply breath-taking.

'The album's contents, containing personal portraiture studies of the people and the places that he knew and loved dearly, communicate with such arresting intimacy a record of the world that Honywood inhabited.

'Before these photographs were discovered, every record or account of this part of England had been translated via the eyes and hands of an artist, perhaps with the assistance of the camera-lucida, but still from the subjective view of a draftsman.

'What we have here is a beautiful and extraordinary intersection of art and science.

'William Henry Fox Talbot had developed and patented his Calotype process (from the Greek Kalos, meaning beautiful), just a decade before.

'Very few people were proficient in this process and fewer excelled with such artistic flair in the way that Honywood did.'

Images of nature, scenic buildings, and portraits of workers were all captured by a technique developed by the photographer in a 'breath-taking' collection

Honywood was Captain of the Horsham Volunteer Fire Brigade for many years and assisted neighbouring towns and villages in starting their own Fire Services, which earned him an oil portrait of himself, which now hangs in Horsham Museum.

Mr Austin added: 'This collection is of huge historical importance to the art of photography and the nation as a whole.

'The exceptional images are the earliest photographs we have of the southern region of England that are known to exist.

'The portraits of farmworkers, soldiers, firemen, and stunning landscape studies taken across Sussex are an incredibly rare slice of social history that should be preserved for current and future generations.

'We anticipate interest from museum's and public collections all over the world, as an early photograph album of such significance appearing on the public market in 2020 is essentially unheard of.'
