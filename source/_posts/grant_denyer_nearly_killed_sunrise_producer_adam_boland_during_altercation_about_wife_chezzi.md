Grant Denyer has shared details of his violent altercation with former Sunrise executive producer Adam Boland 15 years ago.

Speaking about the incident on his It's All True? podcast, Grant explained that the violent blow-up occurred while he was on the job as Sunrise's weatherman in 2005.

Grant, 43, had travelled to Hawaii with Adam to produce a special episode of Sunrise when long-standing tensions between the two men finally came to a head.

'One morning we had a technical failure and the signal drops out and Adam Boland instantly goes absolutely crazy!' he recalled.

Grant claimed that he'd overheard Adam chastising his wife, Chezzi, who was working as Sunrise producer at the time, over the loss of signal.

Chezzi, who had travelled to Hawaii with the crew, was pregnant at the time. It is not suggested Adam knew she was pregnant.

'He turns on Cheryl and says, "She's dropped the ball, Cheryl is useless, incompetent,"' Grant claimed.

Grant said he suddenly snapped, telling Adam: 'That's enough!'

Reflecting on what happened next, he said: 'I needed to put a stop to this. He starts flat out abusing us and I blew up.

'I grabbed him and slammed him against the wall and held him by the throat, yelling at him for 10 minutes.' 

Furious: The pint-sized TV presenter lost his temper when Adam blamed Grant's wife, Chezzi (left), for a technical error. 'I grabbed him and slammed him against the wall and held him by the throat, yelling at him for 10 minutes,' he said

'Enough is enough and I wanted to stop this guy. I let him have it. It wasn't okay. I did the wrong thing but I needed to have my say and it took three people to pull me off him,' he added. 

Grant insisted that he's 'not proud' of the incident. 

'I nearly killed him,' he said. 'I am ashamed of my actions and I'd do it differently now, but a few things happened that brought this to a head.'

Adam has also previously spoken about his clash with Grant in Hawaii.

In his 2014 memoir Brekky Central, Adam described Grant 'storming into the control room' in a fit of fury.

'His face turned red as he levelled abuse, accusing me of insulting his wife,' Adam wrote.

'I instructed him to leave but the yelling continued. Members of the crew were left stunned as they heard it unfold on the production intercom.  

'Here was the weather presenter and executive producer engaged in a screaming match while our happy little breakfast show was still on air.'
