Ivanka Trump visited North Carolina on Monday where she outlined the choices for voters in the upcoming presidential election. 

During a visit to Wilmington, the president's daughter said the state's motto, 'To be, rather than to seem' also reflected the choice in candidates voters face.

'On one hand you have a person who is a vessel for whatever the fringe of the party or the mainstream media want him to be, but on the other hand you have someone who is arguably the most authentic president we've ever had,' Ivanka said during a chat with prospective voters at a Wilmington bakery.

'Washington has not changed Donald Trump,' Ivanka Trump, the President's advisor, said. 'Donald Trump has changed Washington, and it's very true,' she said

Her visit to Wilmington was her fifth visit to North Carolina in three-and-a-half years. The state is key in Donald Trump's re-election campaign. 

It is one of the the most volatile of the swing states, has 15 electoral votes and is considered a must-win for Mr Trump this time around as well.

Ivanka spoke of what she sees as her father's accomplishments including the First Step Act which removed a 'three strikes' life sentence for some offenses and allowing judges more discretion when it comes to the sentencing of non-violent crimes.

'Of all the people who've talked about positively impacting the system for better, it was this president who delivered the most historic criminal justice reform that we've had in a generation and it's just getting started,' Ivanka said.    

The president's daughter also visited a bakery during the time she was in the city

She then went on to sing her father's praises of the government's response towards the coronavirus and stressed how the Paycheck Protection loan Program helped to keep small businesses paying their workers during the pandemic.

Ivanka said her father 'used his business experience to harness the private sector to clear the road blocks that exist within government to get things done.'

The President's daughter also touted his commitment to family policy and education, referencing several pieces of legislation passed by his administration.

'The president is the first president of either party to put paid family leave into his budget,' she said.

Before leaving the crowd of potential voters who were all fully masked, she urged them to 'get out and vote.'

The president 'doesn't want to see the country go in the wrong direction and it won't under his watch,' she assured them. 

Ivanka emphasized her father’s economic agenda moving forward, focusing on four pillars – revision of trade deals, tax reform, deregulation and energy independence
