An HIV-positive accused paedophile who police allege wants to infect children has been freed on bail.

Jadd William Brooker, 38, was granted bail on Thursday at the Christies Beach Magistrates Court in Adelaide to live with his grandmother in home detention.

But he remains in custody as prosecutors work to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.

South Australian Police warned Brooker should not be released as he allegedly pursued teenagers for sex and tried to destroy potential evidence, Adelaide Now reported.

Police allege one of the teenagers Brooker had sex with did not know he was HIV positive, and was also the subject of child exploitation material.

'(The surviving victim) was unaware of Brooker's medical status when they engaged in sexual activity, and he is currently undergoing medical testing,' prosecutors told court on Thursday. 

When he was contacted in prison by his mother she volunteered to delete Brooker's Facebook account and he asked her to wipe other accounts for him, the court heard.

Brooker allegedly provided his email and password for his Microsoft Live account and asked his mother to delete it.

'Given the nature of the charges, a lot of potential evidence is stored in the cloud – potentially millions of pieces of evidence – and this is an attempt to destroy it before police can uncover it,' police prosecutors said.

The 38-year-old allegedly pursued 19 children all aged between 13 and 16 for sex online and also has connections to other alleged paedophiles.

Despite the warnings from police Magistrate Rodney Oates granted bail as he had no prior criminal history, no breaches of bail and the presumption of innocence.

'I do take into account the fact other charges are being investigated but, in relation to this bail application, I must focus on the charges that are before this court,' he told the court. 

Brooker is yet to plead to multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material.

Prosecutors allege the offences occurred from December 2015 and August this year and that Brooker has maintained an illegal relationship with two male teenagers.

Investigators allege to have evidence that Brooker intended to 'infect both children and adults with HIV'. 

Magistrate Oates agreed and released Brooker on $1,000 bail to live with his grandmother under 24-hour electric monitoring. 

Prosecutors are challenging the decision and Brooker's release was postponed pending a hearing.
