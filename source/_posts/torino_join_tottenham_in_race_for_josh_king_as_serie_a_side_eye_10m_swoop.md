Tottenham were the front-runners for his signing, but now Torino have made an offer as they attempt to lure the striker away from England for the first time in his professional career.

Jose Mourinho is desperate to sign some attacking threat as back-up to star man Harry Kane, with Spurs' matches coming thick and fast.

They have loaned youngster Troy Parrott to Millwall and Mourinho feels that they could do with another striker to compete for a place this season.

King has also emerged as a transfer target for Manchester United, and should he move to Old Trafford it would not be the first time in his career.

He previously came through the United academy having joined from Valerenga in 2008, before spending five years at the club.

He then moved on to Blackburn, before securing his move south to Bournemouth where he has been for the past five years.
