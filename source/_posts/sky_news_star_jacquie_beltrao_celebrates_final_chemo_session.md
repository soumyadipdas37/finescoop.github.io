Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao, who revealed in June that she was facing a second battle with breast cancer, has celebrated finishing her latest chemo sessions - but admits she has mixed emotions about the treatment ending. 

Former Olympic gymnast Beltrao, 55, has endured 12 blasts of cold cap chemotherapy since she revealed in early summer that the cancer she first had seven years ago had come back in a 'much nastier' form. 

The sports host said that while the chemotherapy had been hard to endure, she was nervous about not having it.

In a new video to her social media followers, Jacquie Beltrao, 55, shared that she's completed '12 out of 12' of her chemotherapy sessions after she was diagnosed with cancer for a second time in June



The mother-of-three told her fans that she was pleased to see the back of chemotherapy - describing it as like a Dementor from Harry Potter - but was nervous about not having the protection it offered

In a video on her social media accounts, Beltrao said: 'Today's my last chemo, 12 out of 12. 

'I sort of feel delighted obviously because it's like Dementor sucking the lifeblood out of you coming here but it keeps the cancer at bay so I'm kind of nervous going out there without the chemo...' 

The mother-of-three had found a new, 'tiny' lump during lockdown and began chemotherapy soon after. 

She's shared photos of her sessions at the London hospital where she's being treated, including photos of her wearing a cold cap to protect her hair from the chemotherapy.   

Beltrao admitted in July that it had been a 'living nightmare' since her new grade-three diagnosis. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 for which she went through five cycles of chemotherapy in four months.

The sports television star said: 'I'm kind of nervous going out there without the chemo...'

Posing in the cold cap back in July, Jacquie told followers 'Unattractive as the look is it does get you head down to -5 and protects the hair from the chem'

On Twitter this summer, the former Olympic gymnast has posted updates to her 72,000 followers

Speaking in a video posted to Twitter explaining her new diagnosis, Beltrao said: 'So, during lockdown I took my own advice, did a check, found a tiny, tiny, little lump just here.

'Had it checked out and a biopsy straight away and it turns out it's grade three breast cancer, much nastier than the first one I had.

'I'm sharing this because it felt weird to be going back to work on Sky and being on social media and acting like everything was shiny, perfect and fun when it wasn't.'
