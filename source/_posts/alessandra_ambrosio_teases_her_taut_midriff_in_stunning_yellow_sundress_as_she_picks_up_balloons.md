Alessandra Ambrosio has always been a proud Brazilian, frequently visiting her birthplace of Rio Grande do Sul.

But the Victoria's Secret Angel has recently celebrated her other nationality, becoming a United States citizen on Friday.

She teased her taut midriff Sunday in a yellow sundress, as she stepped out with a bouquet of red, white and blue balloons, while apparently shopping for a party in Los Angeles.

The 39-year-old donned a two-piece halter top dress with white and yellow stripes, showing off her toned legs with two thigh-high leg slits.

She finished the look with some clear-framed reflective wayfarers, a white face mask, layers of gold jewelry and a pair of tan leather sandals.  

Ambrosio reportedly became a citizen on Friday, when she was spotted leaving the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in Downtown LA. 

She's lived in the US for roughly 20 years, having kicked off her successful modeling career when she was 15.

Although COVID-19 has forced the cancellation of all naturalization ceremonies, she appears to be having her own celebration after getting all her necessary documents.

The GAL Floripa founder later took to Instagram with a boomerang of her sporting a pink drawstring bikini top and a flower tucked behind her ear.

It was a behind-the-scenes shot from a shoot she previously posted, also modeling a pair of mesh knit white pants in a wicker hanging cocoon chair.
