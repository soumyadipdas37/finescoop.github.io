Actress and 'Defund the police' activist Alyssa Milano was quick to call cops when she believed an armed gunman was on her Bell Canyon property on Sunday morning.

The 47-year-old lives in an 8,000 square foot, $2.5 million home in the upscale gated community that sits just 20 minutes north of Los Angeles

The call ignited a response that included seven Ventura County Sheriffs' vehicles, one K-9 unit, a police helicopter and one Los Angeles Fire Department team that sat down the street on standby. 

DailyMail.com has obtained exclusive photos showing the first responders coming to the aid of the 47-year-old at her five bed, six bath, 8,000 square foot, $2.5 million home in the upscale gated community that sits just 20 minutes north of Los Angeles.

A neighbor tells DailyMail.com, 'We first noticed the helicopter circling overhead very low and knew something was going on, it's usually such a quiet community. Then we saw all the police cars parked in front of Alyssa's home. They had their guns at the ready and seemed very serious.'

Actress Alyssa Milano, who is pro defunding the police - called police when she believed an armed gunman was on her Bell Canyon property in California on Sunday morning

As the morning progressed, residents received updates from law enforcement.

Alyssa and her talent agent husband Dave Bugliari, 39, they said, had dialed 911 when they heard what they believed to be gunshots on their 1.39-acre property.

They allegedly told the emergency hotline the sound 'scared their dogs' and made them feel like the gunman was nearby.

A description was given of a suspect to the officers who was 'male, 40-years old, with long rifle'.

The two, who have been married since 2009, were also concerned that it may be someone stalking the former Charmed and Who's The Boss star.

In 2008, Alyssa filed restraining orders against alleged stalker Jeff Turner, a then 54-year old man she claimed twice tried to break into this same home. 

The 'Nextdoor' neighborhood app was rife with concerns.

'Just drove by about 12 armed officers on Bell Canyon Road,' one resident wrote, 'They are responding to a call reporting a man with a gun in the neighborhood!! This was also the cause of the helicopter. Stay inside, stay safe!'

Alyssa's tweet appears to be at direct odds with her actions on Sunday when she relied on heavy police presence to protect her

The search by air and street level lasted over three hours and ended abruptly at 12.20pm

At least one Los Angeles Fire Department truck was seen on the scene. Alyssa's neighbors estimate it cost thousands of tax payer dollars

The officers then had an impromptu meeting with some of the residents in the Bell Canyon community center, confirming what they dubbed, 'Squirrelgate'

Alyssa Milano's gate sat open with law enforcement guarding the entire perimeter of the street, as these DailyMail.com photos show.

The search by air and street level lasted over three hours and ended abruptly at 12.20pm.

Alyssa and her husband Dave Bugliari were also concerned that it may be someone stalking the former Charmed and Who's The Boss star

'It turned out it was a neighborhood teen with an air gun shooting at squirrels,' a resident told the DailyMail.com.

The male teenager witnessed the emergency response and later realized he was the cause and turned himself in.

The officers then had an impromptu meeting with some of the residents in the Bell Canyon community center, confirming what they dubbed, 'Squirrelgate.'

Alyssa has owned this Bell Canyon home since 2001. She lives there with her husband and their two children, Milo, nine, and Elizabella, six. 

In July, the left leaning activist Alyssa tweeted out to her 3.7 million followers a link, urging them to sign the 'People's Budget L.A.' that demands a 90 percent reduction in police funding.

She tweeted: 'What is the Los Angeles Police Protective League? @LAPPL is a narrow special interest group that lobbies our politicians to protect the LAPD budget, pension + officers. But electeds (sic) need to #ProtectPeopleNot Police. Sign the #People'sBudgetLA petition.'

Then in August she tweeted simply, '#DefundThePolice'.  

'She uses her platform in hypocritical ways. Why not send your husband into the yard to find out what is actually going on before you call the police? I would guesstimate the response today from law enforcement cost tax payers thousands of dollars,' one neighbor said

This tweet appears to be at direct odds with her actions on Sunday, September 20.

One neighbor says, 'She can tweet those things because at the end of the day she lives behind gates in a gated community. She knows the police will come to save her. But what about all those people who don't have that luxury and live in unsafe neighborhoods? She obviously doesn't care. 

'She uses her platform in hypocritical ways. Why not send your husband into the yard to find out what is actually going on before you call the police? I would guesstimate the response today from law enforcement cost tax payers thousands of dollars.'

This isn't the first time she has been called out for being a hypocrite.

In August, ex-Charmed castmate Rose McGowan went on a twitter rant accusing her of stealing the #metoo movement.

Milano enraged McGowan when she defended presidential candidate Joe Biden after sexual assault allegations against him by a former staffer went public.

The feud prompted the hashtag #AlyssaMilanoIsALie to trend on Twitter.
