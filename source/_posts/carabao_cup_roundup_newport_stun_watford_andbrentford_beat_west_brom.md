Newport County reached the fourth round of the Carabao Cup for the first time in their history with a stunning 3-1 win over Championship side Watford at Rodney Parade on Tuesday night.

Mike Flynn’s League Two team were never behind. Tristan Abrahams’ penalty and goals from Joss Labadie and Padraig Amond earned them a fourth-round clash with Morecambe or Newcastle. 

A penalty from Watford’s Adalberto Penaranda in the 54th minute gave the Hornets hope but it wasn’t enough to shake County and Amond fired home the third 11 minutes later to clinch the win. Watford’s night got worse with Stipe Perica sent off two minutes from time for an elbow on Brandon Cooper.

David Raya was Brentford’s hero as Premier League West Bromwich crashed out. The keeper saved Grady Diangana’s shootout penalty as the visitors progressed 5-4 after a 2-2 draw at the Hawthorns.

Baggies skipper Hal Robson-Kanu struck twice from the spot in the second half either side of a brilliant overhead kick from Emiliano Marcondes.

Marcus Forss, a former Baggies trainee, then scored his own penalty to force a shootout.
