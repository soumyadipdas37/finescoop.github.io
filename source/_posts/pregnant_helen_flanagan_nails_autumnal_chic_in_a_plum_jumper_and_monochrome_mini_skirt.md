The star covered her growing baby bump in a plum coloured jumper and a black and white checked mini skirt.

She rounded off her cosy look with black tights and black ankle boots.

The beauty played with her blonde tresses which were styled in a half up, half down 'do, while she upped the glam with a sleek palette of make-up.

Helen was all smiles as she happily posed for the trio of snaps, despite the revelation of her morning sickness woes days earlier. 

The actress took to Instagram on Tuesday to reveal she is 'so relieved' to be over the worst of hyperemis gravidum, which causes excessive nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

Helen discussed her extreme morning sickness as she shared a sweet picture of her daughter Matilda, five, holding up a 'I hope you feel better' card as well as an ultrasound snap from her hospital bed. 

She wrote: 'I've been a lot quieter on my social recently as I've had hyperemis gravidum.

'I had this with both girls but this time was on another level. I am so relieved to be over the worst and so very happy and so grateful for my baby. 

'My mum has just been the best and I have no idea how I would have got through it without her! Scott's been amazing with the girls and the nurses at the Royal Bolton Hospital were so lovely which I'm so grateful for. 

'I just can't wait to meet my little one so in love with them already. I'm going to film an IGTV on hyperemis soon and any other mummy's to be with hyperemis I feel you' (sic).
