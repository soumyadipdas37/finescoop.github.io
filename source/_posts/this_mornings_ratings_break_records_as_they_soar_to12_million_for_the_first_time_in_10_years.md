This Morning is said to have smashed new records for the first time in 10 years.   

The ITV chatshow, which has been airing throughout the coronavirus pandemic, has reportedly seen rating records rise to 1.2 million.  

And amid the new records, This Morning presenter Alison Hammond has landed her own travel segment with co-star Josie Gibson, which will be inspired by the classic film 'Thelma and Louise'. 

Amazing! This Morning is said to have smashed new records for the first time in 10 years with rating records rising to 1.2 million (hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield pictured) 

The two former Big Brother stars, aged 45 and 35, will compete against each other to find the best places to staycation in the UK.

Alison told the Mirror: 'Josie - it's on! Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned game of Top Trumps and even better, This Morning has given it a crazy new twist by incorporating some of Britain’s most unusual staycation spots.' 

While Josie joked to the publication: 'Alison & Josie - some may have coined us the better looking version of Ant & Dec (okay that someone might have been me!).'

A source added: 'Josie's always wanted to work on This Morning and when she originally got the job she asked if she could be the "Judith Chalmers of the UK". So with this new strand she's now got her dream job, with her dream woman in Alison.'

MailOnline has contacted ITV for comment.

It's an exciting time for Alison as she has also landed her own documentary called, Back to School, which will see her take the ultimate school history trip to mark ITV's Black History Month.     

The news comes after it was confirmed that Holly Willoughby and and Phillip Schofield will return to This Morning on Tuesday after their summer break.

The TV duo will be back on screens on September 1, taking back the reins back from Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford who stood in for them during their hiatus.

 Holly had to cut her seven-week family holiday to Portugal short so she could quarantine for two weeks to be ready to return to the show in time.

The show will be back with all of its regular segments and appearances from show favourites such as John Torode, Gino D'Acampo and wellness expert Liz Earle.

The autumn shows will also include a new four-part 'Best of British' series where Nigel Havers will tour around Britain.

Viewers will also be treated to a three-episode series called 'Dr Scott's Super Dogs' which will see the show's resident vet meet dogs who are helping to save lives across the country.  

This Morning continues on weekdays at 10:30am on ITV.
