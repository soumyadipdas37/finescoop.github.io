Anthony Joshua is 'punching harder than ever before'' and plans a 'demolition job' of Tyson Fury, claims his promoter Eddie Hearn.

The IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion is set to defend his titles against mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev on December 12.

And Joshua, 30, has also agreed financial terms to two fights with WBC titleholder Fury next year.

Anthony Joshua is plotting to become the division's undisputed heavyweight king

'I actually messaged him and I said: 'You're going to steamroll through these guys',' Hearn told Sky Sports.

'He just replied in capitals and said: STEAMROLL!'

Asked if Joshua is plotting to become the division's undisputed heavyweight king by stopping Fury, Hearn said: 'I think he'd love to. Yeah.

'He knows that Fury is an outstanding fighter and it's going to be very difficult. But you can ask him for yourself, I believe he has bad intentions in those fights and I believe he expects to.

'I believe he will knock out Kubrat Pulev and Tyson Fury.'

Joshua overhauled his sparring and added new trainers Angel Fernandez and Jobi Clayton to the coaching team led by Rob McCracken in order to deliver a disciplined, skilled performance in his victorious rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr.

But he is 'definitely punching harder than ever before' and is aiming for a swift finish of his next opponents.

'I think he's ready to start doing a demolition job on these guys,' Hearn added.

'I think he's shown, coming back from the Ruiz Jr fight, that he has the ability to box and move. That's in the arsenal now.

'But he still loves knocking people out - and when you see the drills, when you see the pads and you see that spite in his shots.'
