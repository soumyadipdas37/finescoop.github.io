Emily Ratajkowski recently dropped a bombshell on the fashion industry, as she recounted the alleged sexual assault she experienced during a photo shoot.

And the Inamorata founder is keeping her head held high, as her family, friends and fans rally around her in support.

She looked cozy in head-to-toe white Tuesday, as she stepped out with husband Sebastian Bear-McClard and dog Colombo for dinner at il Buco in the NoHo neighborhood of New York City.

The 29-year-old donned an oversized jacket, layered over an equally oversized sweatshirt with sweatpants, tucked into tube socks with a pair of Converse kicks.

She completed the look with a black face mask, as she walked up to the outdoor dining area with Bear-McClard, 39, and their Husky/German shepherd mix.

It comes after Ratajkowski's recent sexual assault allegations against photographer Jonathan Leder were corroborated by actress Nola Palmer, who posted similar allegations Monday to Instagram.

She wrote: 'I have been carrying around the pain and trauma of Jonathan and his abuse for a decade now. I have gone so far as changing my name because in my mind he owned it and I could not look at that name without seeing him.'

Bombshell essay: Ratajkowski opened up last week in a personal essay for The Cut about being allegedly assaulted by Leder in 2012, during a shoot at his home in Woodstock, New York (pictured in February, 2020)

The Titans actress added: 'But for the first time I am able to publicly say, Jonathan Leder was my abuser and that is thanks to Emily Ratajkowski and her bravery.'

Ratajkowski opened up last week in a personal essay for The Cut about being allegedly assaulted by Leder in 2012, during a shoot at his home in Woodstock, New York.

She detailed the lingerie he had her wear, before asking her to go nude, as he offered her one glass of red wine after another.

Later, after the makeup artist for the unpaid shoot went to bed, she and Leder sat on the couch, where she 'absentmindedly' began rubbing her feet against him for warmth.

The Gone Girl actress wrote: 'Most of what came next was a blur except for the feeling. I don’t remember kissing, but I do remember his fingers suddenly being inside of me. Harder and harder and pushing and pushing like no one had touched me before or has touched me since.'

A few years later, she learned that he was selling a book of risqué photographs from the unpaid shoot, which she originally only gave permission to use in a magazine.

Leder provided a copy of a release, which granted him the necessary rights, claiming it was signed by her agent at the time. 

The photographer's representatives have since released a statement, denying her allegations: 'Mr. Leder completely denies her outrageous libelous allegations of being "assaulted." It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive about the publication of the photos.'

Supportive fans: Ratajkowski took to Instagram after the essay was released, as she thanked her 26.8million followers for their support

Ratajkowski took to Instagram after the essay was released, as she thanked her 26.8million followers for their support.

She wrote: 'It’s been nothing short of life-changing to see how many women (and men!) this piece resonated with. 

'Thank you to every single person who read, shared, commented and tagged me. I can’t tell you what it feels like to see my words in print and to hear from each and everyone of you. Thank you.'

The I Feel Pretty actress later expanded on the issue with V Magazine, opening up about how she's evolved over the years as a model and entrepreneur in the fashion industry, as well as how she's approached fragile masculinity.

She told friend and photographer Inez Van Lamsweerde: 'In general, you have no control. When I was younger, I just kind of let things happen. And I struggled with that. 

'I’m so glad that I don’t [have to do that] now. I’m not this passive person who is not in control. I’m 29, so I’m kind of leaving [that] behind.'

Ratajkowski continued: 'I understand, with love, that men’s experiences have been really limited. The way that men feel and process shame is so different. 

'You have to teach them about experiences that you, as a woman in the world, [have had]. Expose them to that.'
