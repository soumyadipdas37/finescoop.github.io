The mother of Julian Assange's children has revealed how the couple was able to secretly conceive their two sons while he was hiding out at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. 

South African-born lawyer Stella Moris is currently raising her two young boys, Gabriel, three, and Max, one, alone in the UK while their Wikileaks founder father continues to fight his extradition to the US on espionage charges.

In an interview with CBS News on Thursday, Moris, who began dating Assange in 2015, revealed how the pair managed to keep their relationship - and her pregnancy - under wraps despite him being under surveillance for years.

Stela Moris, who began dating Assange in 2015, revealed how the pair managed to keep their relationship - and her pregnancy - under wraps while he was hiding out at the Ecuadorian embassy in London 

Moris, who is engaged to Assange, told CBS News the couple shared private moments in a 'camping tent' in his room, away from the CCTV cameras

'We found ways to be private. We had a tent in his room that we put fairy lights in… you know, like a camping tent,' Moris said, adding that the shelter kept them out of view from CCTV cameras. 

The 37-year-old met Assange almost a decade ago after she helped work on a legal bid to halt his extraditions. 

Shortly after those private encounters at the embassy, Moris became pregnant with their first child in 2016 and again in 2019. 

In an earlier interview with 60 Minutes, she revealed she was able to hide both her pregnancies from authorities and the media by layering clothes over baby bump.

'I just piled on layers [of clothes] and complained about getting fat to hide it,' Moris said.

The boys have rarely seen their father since they were born but despite the unconventional circumstances, Moris said Assange was 'the man I wanted to start a family with.'

'I was 33 and we decided, you know, let's live our lives,' she told the news station.  

'I try to give them [kids] as normal a feeling of a family as I can,' she said, adding that the boys speak to their father every day.  

'I tell them that Julian is a hero. And I want them to just see our love and their father's affection to the extent that we can.'  

The 49-year-old Australian faces espionage charges over the leaking of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents.

He was also wanted in Sweden after being accused of rape in 2010. Assange always denied the sex allegations, which have since been dropped.

 Moris said she plans to marry Assange outside Belmarsh Prison in London's outskirts by Christmas this year. 

 Moris is aware there is a chance the children will never be reunited with their father again.  

She told the Sydney Morning Herald she would love to move to Australia as long as the government can protect her family. 

'I'll live wherever he is safe and that's why I want Australia to tell us that he will be safe there,' she said.
