Kaitlyn was armed with a few workout essentials, including a bottle of water nestled into her arm. 

While it may only be week three of the competition, Kaitlyn has already garnered some of the highest scores this season with dance moves that have dazzled viewers and judges alike. 

Unfortunately, Kaitlyn has already suffered a setback with her ankle injury.

Last week she underwent an MRI to get to the root of the matter.

'Getting the MRI right now. Yesterday was kind of a write off for me because I was just in pain and kept my foot elevated and just did nothing all day yesterday,' she said on her Instagram stories.

'I don't want to seem like a baby because I know so many people go through injuries on this show, and battle through, and that's what I'm gonna do. But I just want to keep you guys posted.'

Fortunately, the injury hasn't kept Kaitlyn out of the competition.
