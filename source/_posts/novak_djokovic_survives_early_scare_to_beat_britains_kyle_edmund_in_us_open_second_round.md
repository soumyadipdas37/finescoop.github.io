Novak Djokovic emphatically put the first set disappointment behind him to overcome Britain's No 2 Kyle Edmund in four at the US Open.

Djokovic lost the first set on a tie-break but bounced back to claim the next two 6-3 6-4 before easing to the fourth set - booking his place in the third round at Flushing Meadows.

World No 1 Djokovic ensured there was absolutely no route back for Edmund whatsoever in the fourth after breaking him straight away before taking it 6-2.
