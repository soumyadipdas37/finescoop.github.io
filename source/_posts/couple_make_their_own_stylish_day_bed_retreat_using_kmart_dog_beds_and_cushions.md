A couple who wanted to avoid spending hundreds of dollars on an outdoor furniture set have shared how they built their own stylish day bed for only $78 using wooden pallets, three Kmart dog beds and cushions.

Kmart fan Kayla shared how she and her partner did it to a popular Australian décor Facebook group and revealed how the pair made the outdoor setup.

'My partner and I wanted to get a day bed for our deck but didn't want to pay $500+ so we came up with the idea to get pallets which we painted (free) and added Kmart dog beds to it!' she said.

The dog beds are priced at $20 each and the department store sells a selection of cushions for as little as $4 each.

The pair painted the free pallets to use as the base of the couch before placing the pet beds on top.  

To complete the look, the couple purchased multiple Kmart cushions and said the end result feels 'so comfortable'.

The outdoor day bed is now the couple's favourite spot to lounge in the house.  

Thousands of other social media users were impressed with the idea and were inspired to replicate the bed themselves.

'Omg of course! Dog bed cushions, durable [and] waterproof,' one person said.

'Okay this is hands down one of the best hacks I've ever seen!' another said.

A third added: 'I've done a similar thing but used an old single bed mattress. I put it inside a Kmart king single doona cover'.

'If you have any issues of the cushions slipping when you're sitting on it, add Velcro strips to the top of the pallet and the bottom of the cushion!' another suggested.

More than 2,600 people 'liked' the Facebook post and 266 left a comment by praising the idea or tagging a friend. 

The clever idea is easy to replicate but would be suitable to those who prefer lower couches.  

The $20 pet beds are available on the Kmart website or across stores if stock hasn't sold out prior.
