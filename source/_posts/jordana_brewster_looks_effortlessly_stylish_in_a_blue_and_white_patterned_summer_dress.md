She recently went public with her new businessman boyfriend Mason Morfit after announcing her amicable split from her husband of 13 years earlier this year.

But Jordana Brewster was flying solo as she enjoyed an afternoon of shopping at the Brentwood Country Mart on Wednesday. 

The actress, 40, cut a stylish figure in a strappy blue and white summer dress with spaghetti straps as she made her way back to her car.

The Fast And The Furious star displayed her natural good looks as she went make-up free, and wore her raven tresses in a natural straight style. 

The mother-of-two opted for a chain link and stone necklace and accessorised with cream-framed glasses and a face mask. 

Jordana wore a pair of patterned espadrilles and a straw tote bag as she made her way inside the shopping village.

The actress announced her 'amicable' split from her husband of 13 years, Andrew Form, earlier this year. 

A source close to the couple told People magazine at the time: 'They have the utmost respect for each other. 

'They remain committed to lovingly co-parent their two children as a team.' 

The pair, who are parents to sons Julian, six, and Rowan, four, first met on the set of the horror movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, which he produced and she starred in. 

On their one-year anniversary, he proposed with a 3.2-carat engagement ring and they wed in a private ceremony after a six-month engagement.

Just after filing for divorce, Jordana was seen passionately kissing her new CEO beau, Mason, 44, on a romantic stroll in Malibu. 

Earlier this week, the actress posted their first official couple photo, with the two walking hand and hand from the ocean. 

She captioned the comment with a red heart, as she looked over at her handsome man in the snap.
