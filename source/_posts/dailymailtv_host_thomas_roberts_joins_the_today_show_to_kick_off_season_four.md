'DailyMailTV premieres its fourth season today with a new host, and a pal and former colleague, Thomas Roberts, one of my first friends here at NBC News,' Craig said while introducing the TV pro. 

'I'm really excited about this,' Thomas told his friend, adding: 'It is season four, we do launch this week [and] today is my first official day with our premiere. Last week we had our soft launch. 

'DailyMailTV has been around for four seasons, I've been a fan from the start, and obviously Daily Mail is something that we utilize - or I did utilize in my life inside that building.'

He continued: 'But this is a great TV show; it's got politics, it's got exclusive celebrities stories, it's got everything you want, and then Craig... it's got me!' 

Savannah was more than happy to agree with Thomas, joking: 'You took the words right out of my mouth, that's what I was going to say, that's the main dish right there, we are so happy to have you. 

'That's the main dish right there,' she continued, before admitting: 'That sounds terrible, but we are so happy to have you! You know what I mean, we've been friends for a long time.'

Thomas then went on to share a sneak peek into the upcoming stories that he is most excited about airing, explaining that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will be 'leading the charge' this fall, as well as the 2020 election. 

'Those insider nugget stories that you just find so interesting from the Daily Mail we are going to have for you, plus we've got some great celebrity exclusives that you'll find nowhere else,' he said. 

Pointing out that Savannah and Hoda are both Real Housewives fans, he then shared a hint at an upcoming story that might tickle their fancy above all else. 

'I know you guys are Real Housewives fans right?' he asked, before revealing: 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills... Brandi Glanville, you've probably seen some of that stuff with Denise Richards, we've got inside scoop that puts the whole thing together with exclusive text messages and the conversations that you are only going to find one place, with us, DailyMailTV. 

'I'm very excited about that.'
