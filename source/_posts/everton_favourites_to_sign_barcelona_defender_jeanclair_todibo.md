Everton are looking to push on in the transfer market following an excellent start to their season, as reports claim they are in pole position to sign Jean-Clair Todibo from Barcelona.

The Toffees have so far won all three of their Premier League matches following an exciting summer in the transfer market which has seen the likes of James Rodriguez and Allan arrive and instantly settle into the first-team.

But manager Carlo Ancelotti is still hoping to land a defender before the transfer window closes next Monday and according to Le10Sport, he is homing in on Todibo.

The report claims Everton are favourites to land the 20-year-old on loan who spent the first half of this year on loan at Schalke in Germany.

As a France Under 20 international, the defender secured a dream move to the Nou Camp from Toulouse fewer than six months into his senior career back in January 2019.

However he has played just four LaLiga games for the club since, having failed to make an impact in the first team.

New manager Ronald Koeman did not select him as part of the squad to face Villarreal on Sunday and the tall centre-back was not even part of the Dutchman's plans during pre-season, indicating he is free to leave the club.

Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti is keen to bolster his side's defence after a positive start

Everton have previously purchased Yerry Mina, Lucas Digne and Andre Gomes from Barca and hope the good relationship between the teams can help make negotiations smooth in regards to a deal for Todibo.

The defence remains a problem area of the pitch for Ancelotti, whose side have won all five games they have played so far this term, yet they have conceded five goals in their previous three outings.

Having not won a trophy since the 1995 FA Cup, the Toffees have a chance to book a place in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night when they take on West Ham United at Goodison Park.
