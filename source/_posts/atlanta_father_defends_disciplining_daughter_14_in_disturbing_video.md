A father seen disciplining his teenage daughter in a viral video that sparked outrage has defended his actions.

In the video, Andrew Eugene Anderson of Atlanta, Georgia is seen with his wife as they confront their 14-year-old daughter in their garage, accusing her of running away and stealing.

The video, which shows Anderson hitting and pinning his daughter to the ground with his knees so she can't move, has now been watched more than a million times.

She is also seen trying to get away from her father by running under the garage door, where Anderson is seen trying to grab her hair and then chasing after her.

But the father told Atlanta's WSB-TV that the video looks worse than it is, saying 'they look a lot worse than what they really are' and that his only regret is putting them on social media.

Andrew Eugene Anderson of Gwinnett County, Georgia, was seen 'disciplining' his daughter in an Instagram live video, in which he is seen hitting her, pinning her down and chasing after her when she tries to run away from him

Anderson has defended his actions in a video that has now been viewed over a million times, in which he is seen disciplining his daughter, which many have said was abuse

'I don't regret anything that was seen on video, but I do regret broadcasting the video to other people,' he told the local news station.

'We had our reasons for doing it because we wanted to kind of present information to her followers that are aiding her in giving her a place to stay because they are misinformed.' 

Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter told Fox News that is was too early to talk about possible charges in relation to the incident.

He did confirm that the incident - which WSB-TV said occurred on September 5 - is under investigation, and that his office had contacted family members who the teenager was staying with.

Anderson told the network he has 'never' abused his daughter when the interviewer - Tony Thomas - asked him 'what the police are going to ask you.'

'I didn't sit on her. I didn't put my weight down on her at any time in the video. I strictly used my knees to kind of lock her arms in while I was holding her arms to the side,' he told WSB-TV. 'I've disciplined my child before. I've never struck her in the face.

'I stand behind what I did as a father, somebody who is concerned. I love my daughter, I don't want to hurt my daughter and I don't want her to get hurt,' he added.

In the video, Anderson is seen pinning his daughter to the ground. He has defended his actions, saying the only thing he regrets is that the video were shared on social media

Anderson said that his daughter had run away three times in the past two months, saying that she would not listen to him about the dangers of being with strangers.

The aim of the video, he said, was to show her what could happen if she got into a situation with someone who wanted to harm her.

'My intent was to give her an experience that she could feel because she is not listening to me. I just hope this situation will wake her up in a sense. 

'There's a lot of people out there that love you and you just need to make smarter choices.' Anderson explained. 'I'm sorry it's gotten to where it's gotten to today.'   

The teenager is now staying away from home with family friends, according to reports.
