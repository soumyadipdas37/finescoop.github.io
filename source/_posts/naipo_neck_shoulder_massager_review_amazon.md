If months of working from home has taken its toll, then a neck and shoulder massager might be a seriously worthwhile investment. 

If you're suffering from shoulder or neck pain from being hunched over your laptop or are hoping to soothe pains caused by old injuries, it might be worth joining the hundreds of shopper who have bought, and loved, the Naipo Neck Shoulder Massager.

With over 1,300 ratings and an impressive average score of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon, the massager is being hailed a 'lifesaver' and 'heaven'. Even better, the electric massager is £37.99, which is far less than the price of a trip to the spa. 

The Naipo Neck Shoulder Massager with infrared heat can be used to ease muscle tension and promote blood circulation - and it's priced at just £37.99 on Amazon

It's designed to mimic the movement of a deep kneading manual massage to relieve stiff muscles. Amazon reviewers are calling it a 'must-have machine for home', writing how it 'works super well', has 'great strength for massaging' and is 'easy and convenient to use'.

There are hundreds of enthusiastic reviews for the Naipo Neck Shoulder Massager with shoppers raving about the performance, quality and affordable price. In fact, 71 per cent of shoppers have awarded it the full five-stars. 

While it might not give you the deep muscle treatment of more expensive models like the Theragun, the massager is effective at relieving aches, knots, and muscle tension.

The wraparound massager fits comfortably on your body, making it a great option if you're working from home. The strap handles allow you to apply pressure and adjust the massager to target hard-to-reach areas.

With this massager you're in control. The adjustable intensity button provides three different speeds - low, medium and high - and there's even an added heat option.  

One reviewer wrote: 'I always find my shoulders and neck quite painful, so I wanted a neck massager for pain relief, but all other ones I saw in the shop costs £100+, while this one having a low price and does the job well. 

The strap handles allow you to apply pressure and adjust the massager to target specific areas 

'The heat mode is very satisfying and you can control be direction and speed they move at, I strongly recommend this product!'

The low price point of the Naipo Neck Shoulder Massager hasn't gone unnoticed by Amazon shoppers.  

'It looks, feels and performs like a machine that would costs at least £250, not £39.99!' one wrote. 

'It's amazing and if I didn't know better, I would swear a chiropractor was massaging my back. I have fibromyalgia and sciatica so in constant pain. This is a winner in our household.'

Another added: 'I bought this to replace a more expensive one that got damaged and I have to admit, I prefer this one! 

'I think this is much more comfortable to use, the intensity of the 'kneading' is much better but not as painful and the heat comes through much better. I've been using it to help with a neck condition and it's certainly making a difference.'
