She's currently enjoying a sunshine Ibiza break with her roommate and former Love Island co-star Arabella Chi.

But that didn't stop Harley Brash from putting in the work in as she posed up a storm in yet another sizzling photoshoot with ISAWITFIRST.COM on Thursday.

The 21-year-old beauty showcased her incredible figure in a strapless mismatched bikini as she pulled off a number of seductive poses.

The holidaymaker will face 14 days of quarantine when she returns to the UK after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Harley rose to fame on last year's Love Island, when she was partnered up with Chris Taylor and later became the first couple to split after leaving the villa.

The media personality revealed details about her single life during an interview with FUBAR Radio.

She said: 'I’m happy being single at the moment. I’m just enjoying myself. I’m having fun. I don’t kiss and tell but it is nice.'

The blonde bombshell also blamed their 'busy schedules' for pulling them apart from each other.

She confessed: 'We were just better off as friends…we had such busy schedules and we both realised that it was better to break it off now and we could still be friends.

The former couple's relationship appeared to be on the rocks when fans noticed they were sat apart from one another at the Love Island final.
