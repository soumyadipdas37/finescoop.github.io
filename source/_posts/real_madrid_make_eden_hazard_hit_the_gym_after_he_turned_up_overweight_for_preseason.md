Real Madrid have made a public showing of Eden Hazard working out in the club gym this week, following recent accusations that he has once again 'turned up overweight' for pre-season training.

Just 12 months ago, following his multi-million pound move from Chelsea, Hazard was said to have arrived in the Spanish capital out of shape.

Now, following a stop-start season which was marred by injury, Hazard is once again back in pre-season preparation and questions are being asked regarding his seemingly larger frame.

The winger was called up to the Belgian squad but wasn't played at all by Roberto Martinez

The flames were further stoked when Belgium boss Roberto Martinez called Hazard up for international duty in the UEFA Nations League, only to not play a single minute in the two matches against Denmark and Iceland. 

Diario Sport in Spain report that the club feel Hazard, who signed from Chelsea for £150million in the summer of 2019, should have not reported for international duty and stayed with Real to work on his fitness.

There are questions over his commitment to turning around his fortunes at the Bernabeu following an underwhelming first season that was adversely affected by injury.

It comes as another frustration for Real manager Zinedine Zidane (left) after £150m signing Hazard struggled to make much of an impression during his first season

On Saturday Real Madrid made the interesting move of posting an image of Hazard working out with a large barbell at the club's Cuidad training quarters, without any apparent context.

The image was interpreted by many of Madrid's 91million social media followers as a tactic to reassure supporters that the club's star winger was taking preparation seriously.

Last season Hazard scored just one goal for his new side, as Madrid went on to reclaim the La Liga title from arch rivals Barcelona.

Under returning manager Zinedine however they were unable to continue their Champions League heroics, losing in the last 16 stage to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City over two legs.
