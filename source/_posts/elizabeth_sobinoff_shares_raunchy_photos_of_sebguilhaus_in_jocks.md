Married At First Sight star Elizabeth Sobinoff is going from strength to strength with her boyfriend, Seb Guilhaus. 

And the 29-year-old shared a number of raunchy pictures of the former Adelaide footballer to Instagram on Tuesday.  

'I know I said I was giving posting a break but let's just give some appreciation for my man Seb Guilhaus,' she wrote. 

Racy: Married At First Sight's Elizabeth Sobinoff, 29, (L) shared raunchy photos of her boyfriend Seb Guilhaus, 32, (R) on Tuesday, including one in a pair of tiny red jocks 

In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress. 

In one frame, the tanned Adonis is seen rocking a pair of itty-bitty red jocks, that appeared rolled down, perhaps to avoid tan lines. 

Lizzy went on to promote the personal trainer's six-week challenge. 'Far out why would you not join his 6 week challenge,' she questioned.

Before adding: 'Get a glimpse of this every morning and night. He's going to kill me for posting this �� #sorrynotsorry.'

She finished: 'Literally in the other room right next to me and has no idea' 

It comes after the couple sparked engagement rumours, after they swapped silver rings at the weekend.    

Taking to Instagram, Lizzie shared a sentimental photograph of their new jewellery. 

'He said to me ''Is it S & L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it.'  

Ringing it in: 'He said to me ''Is it S & L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it,' Lizzie wrote

Over at Seb's Instagram, he wrote: 'Compromise ... give and take ... melding of two worlds.'

'For relationships to flourish we need to want to really be a part of each others worlds,' he continued. 

The rings were just a sweet gesture and not to signify an engagement. 

So in love! Elizabeth often shares loved-up selfies with her hunky other half, after meeting him during her second stint on Married At First Sight  

Elizabeth and Seb met while starring on her second season of Married At First Sight in 2020.

The pair were recently forced to spend three months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic, after she returned to Sydney for work while he stayed in Adelaide.  

She said they ultimately stayed connected through 'constant texting' while apart, and finally reunited in June.
