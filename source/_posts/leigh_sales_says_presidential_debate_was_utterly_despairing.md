Leigh Sales has said the US presidential debate was 'utterly despairing' after Donald Trump and Joe Biden repeatedly talked over each other.

The 7.30 Report host said the debate moderator should be given the power to mute one candidate when the other is speaking.

The first of three presidential debates in the lead up to the November 3 election was held on Tuesday night at Case Western University in Cleveland, Ohio.

The 7.30 Report host said the debate moderator should be given the power to mute one candidate when the other is speaking.

Analysts said the quality of the debate was low as both men constantly interrupted one another and moderator Chris Wallace struggled to contain them. 

Sales Tweeted: 'For the next two debates, the moderator needs the ability to ride the microphones to fade the candidates when it is not their turn. This is utterly despairing to watch for anyone who cares about America #2020debate'. 

Proceedings started out civilly as Democrat candidate Biden welcomed the President to the stage by saying: 'How you doing, man?'

But within 15 minutes, the debate had devolved into a series of endless interruptions, with Biden, seemingly unable to complete a sentence, finally blurting out, 'Will you shut up, man?' 

Trump came out of the gate looking to challenge Biden and badgered him throughout the debate, drawing a string of rejoinders from the Democrat, including a plea to 'just shush for a minute' at the half-hour mark.

At other points, the two candidates dialed down their rhetoric, only to resume their interruptions once again. 

When Trump was fielding a question about a report that he paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, Biden was the one interjecting: 'Show us your taxes. Show us your taxes.'

Roughly 50 minutes into the debate, moderator Chris Wallace's frustration came to a boil as he tried to regain control.

'Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but why should I be any different than the two of you?' Wallace said, drawing some muffled laughter from both sides of the otherwise mostly quiet room.

Trump blamed Biden, but Wallace firmly pushed back to the president, saying: 'Frankly, you've been doing more interrupting.'  

Jill Biden joined her husband Joe on stage at the end of the debate, giving him a quick hug while wearing a face mask
