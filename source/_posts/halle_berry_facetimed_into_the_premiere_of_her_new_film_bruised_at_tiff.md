While Halle Berry couldn't make it to the Toronto International Film Festival for their drive-in premiere of her directorial debut Bruised, she did put in an appearance via facetime.

The 54-year-old actress stars in and directs Bruised, which was picked up in a massive $20 million deal by Netflix on Friday, a day before the Saturday premiere.

With the help of her co-star Shameir Anderson, Berry facetimed into the premiere, and later shared video from the premiere, held at Toronto's CityView Drive-In.

Berry also shared video from Instagram user Alicia Vivianga, where Shameir Anderson was on stage trying to connect with Berry through facetime.

'This is a TIFF moment, a TIFF first,' Anderson proclaimed, before Berry was connected, as viewers in their cars started honking their horns for Berry.

Anderson then told her that it was a 'sold out show' for the premiere of her directorial debut and asked his co-star and director how she feels.
