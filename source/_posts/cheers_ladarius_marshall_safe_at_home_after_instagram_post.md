La'Darius Marshall, who stared in the Netflix docu-series Cheer, is 'safe at home' with family after sharing a troubling Instagram post.

The 22-year-old intimated that he may harm himself, writing that he was a 'broken kid who has lost his fight' and had 'given up,' in the now-deleted social media message shared on Thursday.

After the message was deleted, it was replaced by one from his caretaker Debbie Bonner, who explained that the cheerleader was home and getting 'the help he needs.'

Concern: La'Darius Marshall, who stared in the Netflix docu-series Cheer, is 'safe at home' with family after sharing a troubling, now-deleted Instagram post that intimated he may harm himself 

'Ladarius Marshall is safe are home here in Texas with me @dlbonn,' Debbie wrote. 'Thank you all for carrying for our Boy, he will receive the help he needs I'll make sure of it. We will take good care of him.'

While attending Navarro College and filming the Netflix series Cheer, La'Darius lived with Debbie and her family.

Along with her caption assuaging the concerns of his nearly 550K followers, Debbie shared a heartwarming photo of La'Darius snuggled up with her and a toddler aged family member on the couch.

Debbie's post came in response to an alarming post shared by the athlete the day prior that appeared to suggest that he may have been struggling with suicidal thoughts.

'Ladarius Marshall is safe are home here in Texas with me @dlbonn,' Cheer mom Debbie Bonner wrote. 'Thank you all for carrying for our Boy, he will receive the help he needs I'll make sure of it. We will take good care of him.'

In a 'message to my people' Marshall explained that he had been pretending to be happy for the sake of social media and couldn't do it anymore.

'Ladarius Marshall is floating away, going away, fading away. I have hurt people, I have loved people, and I have given all I am to few people,' he wrote in the lengthy since- removed post, according to E! News.

'Some people are strong enough to make it in the end but my fight stops here. I have loved so much that when something falls away it takes a piece of me with it. What's left of me is nothing, I'm empty,' he continued.

In one of the more troubling parts, the reality star spoke about how he wanted to be remembered for the 'positive things that I have brought into your life.' 

'I am not what my media shows,' he said in the emotional message. 'I'm a broken kid who has lost his fight, his battle, and his war. Carry on with life, but keep me in your memories,' he continued.  

'I love each and every single one of you guys. I hope that God shows you the way. Hurt people hurt people, and I'm tired of hurting people. It's ok I'll be smiling wherever I'm going. I have Given up this time.'

'I am not what my media shows,' he said in the emotional message. 'I'm a broken kid who has lost his fight, his battle, and his war. Carry on with life, but keep me in your memories,' he continued.

Fans were immediately troubled by the words and the tone and his Navarro friends Jerry Harris and Gabi Butler jumped into the comments to offer their support.

'Please, please, please just know that you are very loved and cared about,' Gabi wrote before the post was deleted. 

She later confirmed that he was safe and sound in a post on her Instagram story. 'Just to share with you guys, Ladarius is safe and okay,' Gabi wrote.

La'Darius was one of the breakout stars of the Netflix docu-series Cheer. He was quite candid on the show about his struggles as a child, including being sexually abused as a child.

'You have to battle yourself and battle your inner demons … because they tell you it is socially unacceptable to talk about it and you're being a wuss if you do,' Marshall told The Cut. 'And I just don't see how that culture is even close to being healthy. That's like me going through my entire life and not telling my story.' 

Adding: 'I never wanted to be perceived as a victim... I don't like the word... I know what I've been through, but look how far I made it.'
