One of film's most iconic franchises is set to get the TV treatment.

A Godfather series is in the works for ViacomCBS's streaming service, which will be rebranded as Paramount+ come next year.

Called The Offer, the 10-episode scripted limited series will be about Al Ruddy's experience producing the Oscar-winning films, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Paramount+ will roll out its full revamp in early 2021, featuring titles inspired by well-known franchises sure to bring in ready-made audiences.

In addition to their The Godfather project, ViacomCBS is planning to reboot the sitcom The Game, a spin-off of the popular series Girlfriends. 

Paramount+ will feature the true crime docuseries The Real Criminal Minds based off of the popular CBS TV procedural Criminal Minds, when ended in February after 15 seasons.

A previously announced kids show set in Nickelodeon's Spongebob Squarepants universe and titled Kamp Koral will also be part of the initial batch of Paramount+ series.

Paramount+ will also be packed with programming from ViacomCBS's robust portfolio of networks, planning to offer over 30,000 TV episodes and movies from well-known brands like BET, Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon. 

Paramount+'s predecessor CBS All Access launched in 2014 in the US. 

The $6 a month service was early to join the standalone streaming game, offering originals like The Good Wife spinoff The Good Fight, a new Star Trek saga and the Jordan Peele-created reimagining of Twilight Zone.

ViacomCBS is hoping the 2021 rebrand will lend some of Paramount Studio's Hollywood heft, according to CEO Bob Bakish. 

'Paramount is an iconic and storied brand beloved by consumers all over the world, and it is synonymous with quality, integrity and world-class storytelling,' the exec said in a statement.

'With Paramount+, we're excited to establish one global streaming brand in the broad-pay segment that will draw on the sheer breadth and depth of the ViacomCBS portfolio to offer an extraordinary collection of content for everyone to enjoy.'  

The ViacomCBS streaming platform already uses the Paramount+ moniker in Latin America and the Nordics.
