President Donald Trump kicked off his campaign to push through the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett – while giving his own campaign a lift from the nomination.

Trump immediately flew to Pennsylvania just minutes after announcing Barrett as his nominee for the Supreme Court, heralding the selection before a large outdoor, mostly unmasked crowd in the battleground state.

'I've just come from the Rose Garden of the White House, where I proudly nominated judge Amy Coney Barrett,' Trump said. He cited her 'brilliant legal mind' and said it was 'a little better than Biden.'

'She should be running for president,' he said. He said Barrett 'will defend your god given rights and freedoms.'

But even if Trump is thrilled with his pick, he quickly moved on to other grievances at his rally.

He attacked his Democratic rival repeatedly – while venting about impeachment, the Mike Flynn Prosecution, and Barack Obama 'spying' on his campaign.

Trump said Biden's own list of court picks would be 'handpicked by socialists' like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.

Trump once again attacked mail-in ballots, after spending days under fire for comments where he declined to say he would accept a peaceful transfer of power.

'The only way they can win Pennsylvania, frankly, is to cheat on the ballots,' he said.

'I don't want to end up in the Supreme Court and I don't want to go. back to Congress either – even though we have an advantage in Congress,' Trump said – referencing a contested election.

'I guess it's 26 to 22, because it's counted by state,' Trump said. 'I'm sure they're trying to figure out.'

Under a disputed election, the decision is thrown to the House, where each state gets a single vote and Republicans have an advantage despite being in the minority overall.

Trump talked up his selection – highlighting his nominee's family and legal credentials.

His trip came after the Supreme Court vacancy and Trump's nomination shook up the presidential race – with just six weeks to go before Election Day.

The White House is hoping the nomination galvanizes base voters, including social and religious conservatives in western Pennsylvania, in counties Trump is counting on to counter huge margins for Joe Biden in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

He spoke a night after another campaign rally in Newport News, where he once again addressed the topic that roiled Washington after he refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.

'We've got to watch this ballot scam, because they're scamming us. And then they say, 'He doesn't want to turn over [power].' Of course, I do. But it's got to be a fair election,' Trump said.

He railed against the 'scam' where 'they're losing ballots all over the place, when they're losing ballots that just happen to be Trump ballots.'

Trump said he wanted a 'smooth, beautiful transition.'

He said the current scenario was a 'disaster waiting to happen.'

'And the only hope we have really other than going through a long unbelievable litigation at the end after it's over, because we're going to win. We're not going to lose this except if they cheat, that's the way I look at it,' he said. He added: 'We can't let them cheat. 'These people will destroy our country.'

'We do want a very friendly transition but we don't want to be cheated and be stupid and say let's trans… we'll go and do a transition and we know that,' the president said Friday.
