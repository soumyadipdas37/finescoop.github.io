On Saturday, the Captain America star accidentally leaked an X-rated photo on his Instagram story.

And three days after the embarrassing situation, Chris Evans was grilled about it during his appearance on the Tamron Hall show.

The appearance on the show began with Tamrom pointing out Chris' tweet from Monday where he wrote: 'Now that I have your attention.... Vote Nove 3rd!!!'

'Chris last night. You tweeted out last night something referencing I think... you were trending over the weekend and your brother even commented that he left social media for the weekend and logged back on, "what did I miss?"'

She continued: 'You said "Now that I have your attention vote.

 The 39-year-old Captain America star had posted a video which ended with a quick glimpse of his camera roll, including a black-and-white photo of someone's penis. 

On Monday, the movie star broke his silence on Twitter Monday to poke fun at the embarrassing situation as he urged his fans to vote in the upcoming presidential election on November 3.

The actor wrote to his 14 million followers on Twitter: 'Now that I have your attention.... VOTE Nov 3rd!!!' 

Chris added two emojis of a man with his hand on his face and another as he shrugged his shoulders.  

The Avengers: Endgame star shared a short video to his Instagram Stories on Saturday of himself and some friends playing Heads Up.

But at the end of the video, a shot of the actor's phone camera roll came up, which featured the nude image. The entire clip has since been deleted.

The picture didn't leave anything to the imagination, but it was cropped too closely to have any identifying features.

Another image in the photo grid featured a headshot of the Avengers star with the words 'Guard That P***y' superimposed.  

Chris quickly became the subject of hundreds of thousands of tweets about the shocking photo.

Most posts took a lighthearted approach to the accidental disclosure, with some gushing about the actor's potential anatomy. 

 Although plenty of users had their own reactions to the accidental photo, a meme quickly developed in which Twitter posters shared the image of Evans' camera roll (which was cropped out by Twitter) but included something unexpected in place of the penis.

'Can someone explain why chris evans has this picture of thanos in his phone?' one post read, while featuring a camera roll snap including a humorous image of Thanos from the Avengers films with his bulging muscles and derriere exposed. 

Twitter: The reaction on social media was mostly supportive, while it was also met with good-natured jokes and memes from friends and fans

Many Twitter users called out those who searched for the nude photos and posting them because Chris did not consent to it.  

Fellow Marvel actor Kat Dennings, 34, used the opportunity to call out a sexist double standard.

She wrote: 'The public respect for Chris Evans' privacy/feelings is wonderful. Wouldn't it be nice if it extended to women when this kind of thing happens?'  

Chris' brother Scott Evans did not let the moment fly by as he hilariously addressed it on his Twitter account on Sunday morning.

'Was off social media for the day yesterday. So. What'd I miss?' the 36-year-old tweeted.  

Chris' Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo also attempted to cheer the actor up following the unusual photo leak.

'Bro, while Trump is in office there is NOTHING you could possibly do to embarrass yourself. See... silver lining,' Mark assured his costar.

Evans was most recently linked to Baby Driver actress Lily James, after they were spotted together twice while in London in July.

In 2016, he sparked a relationship with former SNL actress Jenny Slate.

The couple took a break in 2017 before reuniting later in the year, though they broke up for good in March of 2018.

Prior to that he had a years-long on–off relationship with Minka Kelly.
