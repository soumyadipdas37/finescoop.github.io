She spent more than a decade living in Los Angeles covering ritzy red carpet events and interviewing celebrities for Extra TV. 

But Australian native Renee Bargh has revealed that she has no plans to live in the US again following her return Down Under to co-host The Voice Australia with Darren McMullen. 

In an interview with Sydney Confidential on Thursday, the 34-year-old explained that she feels  'safe and comfortable' in Australia.

'I feel so safe and comfortable here,' she told the publication. 

'I feel like I am here permanently and LA, I can't wait to go back there when I can but this is home base now.' 

According to the publication Renee is still working remotely for Extra, filing stories from Australia and undertaking international junkets via Zoom.

However, Renee's role as co-host on The Voice will not be going ahead following the show's move from Channel Nine to Channel Seven.

The network is set to replace the new hosts, Renee and Darren, with former host Sonia Kruger, who made the jump to Channel Seven in November last year. 

And, it's not the only change that the network plans to make to the hit singing competition.
