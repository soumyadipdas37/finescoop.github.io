A top detective wore a recording device in her bra in a desperate attempt to take down the leader of one of Australia's most violent gangs. 

Farhad Qaumi, the former leader of the Blacktown chapter of Brothers 4 Life, is serving a 60-year jail sentence for a string of crimes, including murder. 

But before the 37-year-old was locked away for good, detectives planned an elaborate sting in the hope Qaumi would confess to his offences.

A Woman of Force, by Mark Morri, follows Detective Superintendent Deborah Wallace's 36 year career with the NSW Police, where she worked to take down some of the state's most notorious gangs.

An excerpt from the book published in The Daily Telegraph detailed Ms Wallace's attempt to gather proof Qaumi was behind a violent rampage in Sydney's western suburbs.

In November 2013, Qaumi and Ms Wallace were on the same flight back to Sydney from Thailand. 

Detectives investigating the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy had been following Qaumi's movements when the bikie boss was heard discussing Ms Wallace and travelling on the same plane as her.

'She is like me, a general of an army. We are both generals,' he had said.  

Homicide Detective Glen Browne thought authorities could use Qaumi's opinion of Ms Wallace to their advantage after the gang boss was arrested in January 2014.

'I didn't know Deb Wallace that well, but I wanted her to wear a wire and try to talk to Qaumi. It was a bit of mad idea but the boss of Homicide, Michael Willing, said if I could swing it, go ahead,' Mr Browne said.

Mr Browne organised for Qaumi to be transported to Long Bay Jail for questioning over an old murder charge he had beaten.  

'The timing had to be perfect. Deb was to walk past the room with one of the prison guards at the exact moment the door was opened, so Qaumi could see her,' he said.

Ms Wallace was wired up with two listening devices and when she walked past the room, Qaumi called out to her.

She suggested the pair go for a walk around some loading docks. 

Qaumi told Ms Wallace she had been a solider who worked her way to the 'top' - just like he had.   

He did not admit to the killings or ordering murders during the pair's hour-long conversation. He was then taken back to Goulburn Supermax.

Qaumi was jailed for at least 43 years for a 'violent underworld rampage' throughout Sydney's west in 2013 involving his two brothers and Brothers 4 Life gang members.

Those crimes included the murder of Joe Antoun - who was shot five times after opening the front door to his home, with his daughters just inside - and the manslaughter of Mumtaz Qaumi, 32.

A Woman of Force, published by Pan McMillan, will be out on September 22.
