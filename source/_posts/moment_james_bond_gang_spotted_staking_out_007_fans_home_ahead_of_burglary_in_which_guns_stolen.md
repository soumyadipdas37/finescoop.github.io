This is the moment a gang who stole five guns famously used in James Bond films were spotted carrying out surveillance on the property they were preparing to raid.

In what police have described as a 'scene reminiscent of a James Bond movie', CCTV footage shows the gang taking pictures of the 007 fan's home minutes before the burglary took place.

The short video shows a brief camera flash coming from the window of a silver Vauxhall Minerva - which police say was used to stake out the property.

It comes as police make a fresh plea for help to find the stolen guns, which were used in various Bond films and are said to be worth more than £100,000.

The iconic Walther PPK handgun used in Roger Moore's final outing as Bond in A View To A Kill, and Beretta Cheetah and Tomcat pistols from Pierce Brosnan's Die Another Day were stolen at an Aldersbrook Avenue property in Enfield, London, on Monday, March 23.

A Revolver Smith and Weston 44 Magnum featured in Live And Let Die, as well as a Llama 22 calibre handgun from Pierce Brosnan's last outing as 007.

One of the firearms - a yellow-handed Llama pistol - was subsequently recovered by a member of the public in a field near to Roydon Railway Station in Essex in April.

Enquiries to locate the four outstanding firearms, which are all deactivated, are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Paul Ridley, from North Area CID, who is investigating the burglary, said: 'It has now been six months since the burglary and only one of the firearms has been recovered.

'Sadly, this has been severely rusted due to being exposed to the elements outdoors and its integrity destroyed.

'We now have images of a vehicle that was parked near to the scene of the crime and appears to be carrying out reconnaissance in the area.

'In scenes reminiscent of a James Bond movie you can even see the flash of a camera from the occupant engaged in the surveillance.

The stolen guns:

One Beretta 'Cheetah' auto pistol, serial number H02641Y;

One Walther PPK, serial number 146872;

One Revolver Smith and Weston 44 Magnum, serial number N60304;

One Beretta 'Tomcat' auto pistol, serial number DAA264306;

One Llama 22 cal. Serial number 271915. 

'I believe these individuals were involved in the crime, it was only a matter of minutes prior to the raid.'

Police have previously described the intruders as three white males with Eastern European accents who drove away in a silver vehicle. 

It is believed the suspects forced entry, before stealing the five deactivated weapons, estimated to be worth more than £100,000.

Officers say the suspects were disturbed by neighbours during the raid and left the scene before officers arrived.

They are believed to have jumped through an open window before fleeing in their getaway car. No arrests have yet been made.

The Met Police have described the stolen firearms as 'very distinctive and bespoke', and 'will almost certainly be recognised by the public'.

Detective Inspector Paul Ridley added: 'The owner of these unique items is devastated, particularly in terms of the sentimental value - they were due to be showcased on display as part of a national exhibition.

'I have provided photographs of the stolen firearms and provided the unique serial numbers. Many of these items are very unique.

'For example, the Magnum is the only one in the world ever made where the whole gun is finished in chrome. It has a six-and-a-half inch barrel and wood grips.

'The Walther PPK was the last gun used by Roger Moore in View to a Kill in a famous scene with Grace Jones who descends the Eiffel Tower on a parachute.

'I would urge any members of the public that may have witnessed the suspects arriving and leaving, know where the firearms are now, or may have been offered these stolen items for sale, to come forward to my investigation team as a priority.'

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to call police on 101, quoting CAD 5890/23Mar. Alternatively tweet @Met_CC or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. 

The Walther PPK is a German pistol that became a firm staple of 007 movies from 1962's Dr No to 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies. In that period, the pistol did not feature in 1979's Moonraker and 1983's Octopussy.

The PPK makes its literary debut in Dr No, the sixth book in the Ian Fleming spy series, after Bond is handed the weapon as he recovers from injuries.

It became 007's preferred weapon of choice in the movie franchise after its use in Dr No, starring Sean Connery. The pistol was not used in Roger Moore's Moonraker, where Bond is never seen using a sidearm, and Moore's Octopussy, in which 007 uses a Walther P5 instead.

Bond adopts the Walther P99 in Tomorrow Never Dies, starring Brosnan. 

Despite the posters and promotional material for Casino Royale (2006) starring Daniel Craig, it was only used during the pre-title fight sequence. 

For 2008's Quantum of Solace, the Walther PPK made a welcome return as 007's choice of sidearm, and was also used in Skyfall (2012).
