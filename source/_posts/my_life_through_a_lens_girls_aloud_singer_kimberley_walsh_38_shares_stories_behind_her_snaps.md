Celebrities share the stories behind their snaps. This week it's actress and former Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh, 38. 

Kimberley Walsh, 38, shares the photos which hold treasured memories for her. Pictured, attending the press night performance of 'Sleepless: The Musical' at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre on September 1, 2020 in London

1982: This picture doesn't show it, but I was a very placid baby. I'm one of the middle children of four siblings and I've always been the most chilled out of all of us. I have my moments, but my older sister Sally is more dramatic so maybe I was the balance to that. This was taken at my first birthday party. In those days parties meant jam tarts and pass the parcel – if we were lucky – and we loved it.

1988: I was always old for my age. Even at primary school I was like an old woman and people used to find the stuff I came out with very amusing. My son Bobby is exactly the same. The performing bug was instant for me – the first dance I ever did publicly was a full-on song called Hand Me Down My Silver Trumpet Gabriel and I thought all my Christmases had come at once.

2002: Louis Walsh has always got something interesting to say about everyone. God knows what he tells people about us. This was taken with him and other girls from the TV show Popstars: The Rivals, including Javine Hylton [far right, with Kimberley second right] just after we formed Girls Aloud – he was our manager, but he didn't really manage us. He's admitted that himself. He didn't even have an answerphone. Louis was looking after Westlife and I don't think he knew how to engage with a girl band. In fairness, he has apologised and we've made our peace.

2009: Climbing Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief was such a struggle. Fearne Cotton [far right] had bad altitude sickness and I found the whole thing really hard. I felt like a broken woman getting off that plane after we were done. I'm usually level-headed, but the altitude can make your mind go weird and over-emotional. Cheryl always says I came down the mountain a different person, which is true. I broke down some emotional barriers and she'd never seen me like that. Normally I'm the mother hen looking after everyone else but this time it was the other way around.

2009: We were all feeling exactly how we look here… absolutely elated. Winning a Brit Award for Best Single for our song The Promise was the biggest high of my Girls Aloud time. The record label didn't want us to release it as a single so we had to fight for it. We were right to have faith in our convictions. I did the speech as we collected the award and I'll always remember Sarah interrupting in her characteristic fashion – we wouldn't want it any other way.

2010: If you'd told me when I was young that I'd meet the Royal Family I'd say, 'Don't be ridiculous', but I have chatted to them all. Camilla is a Strictly fan and I was on the show so we've had a laugh about that and here I am at a breast cancer event with Prince Charles. That's my dance teacher in the background laughing. She had breast cancer so I got on board to help her. Charles is warm and engaging – and the fact that he knew who I was was enough for me!

2012: This was taken on the morning of the Strictly final so I was still in the running with Dani Harmer, Louis Smith and my good friend Denise Van Outen, but I knew Louis would win. He'd been on such a big journey. It was lovely to come joint runner-up with Denise, she's been bit of a mentor to me. I adored Strictly. The shows were stressful but I never got tired of the rehearsal period. I was so glad I made it to the end because I got to learn most of the dances. 

2018: Here I am at Disneyland Paris with my husband Justin and sons Bobby, who's now six, and Cole, who's three. Having a family has shifted everything for me. Justin and I have been together for 18 years so we're a solid unit, but the kids made it even stronger. Justin proposed in the delivery room – he had newborn Bobby in one arm and suddenly the pair of them were sinking down towards the floor. I was in bits.
