Justin Bieber debuted his brand new neck tattoo on Instagram yesterday.

And the Yummy singer, 26, was proud to show off his new ink when he took wife Hailey Bieber on a lunch date at Il Pastaio in Beverly Hills on Tuesday. 

There was no hiding Justin's new body art, which climbed up from his collarbone to right under his chin for all to see.

Mr. Bieber dressed casually for the outing, keeping comfortable in a pair of grey basketball shorts from his Drew brand and a crisp, white tee shirt.

He added some glitz with a feline-looking diamond pendant which could have been a tribute to late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.

Justin walked along the concrete wearing a brown pair of Yeezy slides from friend Kanye West's fashion line.

Both Biebers were protecting themselves and others from COVID-19 germs, seen donning chic disposable masks from Evolve Together.

Not needing much to glow, she kept makeup free and twisted her dark blonde locks out of her face in a bun. 

The model carried her things in a leather mini backpack instead of a purse.

It looked like Justin was quite comfortable with his surroundings, seen sauntering out of the eatery holding a beverage.

New addition: Bieber paid a visit to his favorite tattoo artist Dr. Woo on Monday afternoon

The Stuck With U singer first revealed his new tattoo online Monday on Instagram.

He gave a shout-out to celeb-beloved tattoo artist Dr. Woo, who is known for his intricate, fine-lined work.

The Baby singer also shared a video of him getting inked on his Instagram Story.

Dr. Woo has also tatted the likes of Drake, Travis Scott, Sky Ferriera, and Justin's wife of nearly two-years Hailey.

A plethora of Justin's tattoos have been crafted by the renown artist, with the most recent being in February.

During that visit with Dr. Woo, Bieber had a 'collar wreath' inked just above his collar bones.

'Collar wreath for the dude JB,' captioned Dr. Woo, who showed off the pristine piece on his Instagram page.

In December of last year, Justin had Dr. Woo add the word 'Forever' to his neck as an homage to his wife Hailey, whom he married in 2018.
