Jordyn Woods has revealed the pain and loneliness she endured after landing at the heart of a cheating scandal involving Khloe Kardashian's boyfriend Tristan Thompson in 2019.

Jordyn, 23, reflected on the aftermath of the controversy in an interview with Hillsong Channel's Natalie Manuel Lee, where she revealed she found herself in a 'dark place' after the accusations came to light.  

Ultimately, after a lot of self-reflection, Jordyn found peace within herself and grew into a stronger person. 

'I just felt like I had no one': Jordyn Woods has revealed the pain and loneliness she endured after landing at the heart of a cheating scandal involving Khloe Kardashian's boyfriend Tristan Thompson in 2019

'I remember just sitting in a very dark place. I had my family to talk to, I had you to talk to, but I just felt like I had no one,' Jordyn told Natalie.

Jordyn faced backlash after it emerged she had shared a kiss with Tristan at a party when he was still dating Khloe, whom he shares daughter True with.

The scandal meant the end of Jordyn's years-long friendship with the Kardashian family, and drove a wedge between herself and BFF Kylie Jenner.

Despite years of history, their friendship would not survive.

'You take everything you think you know for a whole decade, the people you think you know, the life you think you know, everything that you've grown up doing and take it all away from someone. I didn't even know how to feel,' Jordyn admitted.

In the aftermath, Jordyn did a lot of self-reflection on the role she played in the matter. 

'Looking at the situation, 'Okay what did I do, what role did I play in this, how was I responsible, how can I be held accountable, how can I take responsibility for what happened?'

For Jordyn, accountability was an important part of the healing process.  

'Things happen and that's what makes us human. But just acceptance and accountability and responsibility. I feel like people in this generation lack accountability and when you can't accept what you've done or you can't accept that, then you can't heal from it.' 

Opening up: Woods took ownership of the role she played in the affair 

'It's easy to beat yourself up over things that you could have done differently,' she said. 'You can't hold on to what you could have or should have done, you just have to accept what actually happened and then you can let it go. It might take you a month to let it go, it might take you a year to let it go but you have to start praying to be able to let it go.' 

While Jordyn at least had her family and faith to get her through the trouble, that didn't stop her from feeling completely alone. 

'It's easy to make it seem like the world is against you and in that case in that moment, I did feel like everything was against me. The only thing I really had to lean on was my faith and my family. At some point in time, you're going to go through something that feels like your world is falling apart.' 

Painful: Combined with the death of her father in 2017, Jordyn called the controversy 'some of the most traumatic experiences a person can go through' 

'I'm not happy that people were hurt': Though she grew into a stronger person as a result of the scandal, that doesn't mean Jordyn is happy with how it played out

Moving forward: For Jordyn, accountability was an important part of the healing process

Jordyn revealed she avoided contact with all but a few close individuals following the scandal, having grown mistrustful of others as a result of the controversy.   

'I wouldn't respond to anyone. I responded to about two people. I pushed people away that probably shouldn't have been pushed away but I just couldn't trust anyone. Everything in my life changed,' she said.

Combined with the death of her father in 2017, Jordyn called the controversy 'some of the most traumatic experiences a person can go through.'

Heart to heart: Woods candidly described the pain and anguish in the aftermath of the kissing incident 

'A lot can happen in one year, a lot. A lot can happen in one day. A lot did happen to me in one day,' she said. 'Over months, and losing everything I thought I knew and gaining so much knowledge, you just can only be happy. The amount of strength I've gained in this year alone, nothing else could have shaped me to the person I am today.' 

Though she grew as a result of the scandal, that doesn't mean Jordyn is happy with how it played out.

'I'm not happy that people were hurt and people had to go through what they went through,' she admitted. 'It was a lot for everyone, my family, other families, friends and not in a million years have I had a negative intention to do anything bad to anyone that I love. I wouldn't say that I'm happy something like that happened, but I'm happy that I was able to become who I am today.'

Indeed, not only was Jordyn hurt, but so was Khloe, who publicly called her out on Twitter after Jordyn shared her side of the story on Red Table Talk.

'Why are you lying @jordynwoods??' Khloe tweeted at the time. 'If you're going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!'

Ultimately, Jordyn found answers after turning to her faith.

After asking God why the incident happened to her, she came to a realization.   

'When I stood still, I had a second and it was almost like this voice popped into my head and said, "Not why you, yes you." This is your path. Life doesn't happen to you, it happens for you.' 

It has been over a year since the scandal transpired, and it seems everyone has moved on from the pain of the event.

Khloe has reconciled with Tristan, and Jordyn is now dating NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns.
