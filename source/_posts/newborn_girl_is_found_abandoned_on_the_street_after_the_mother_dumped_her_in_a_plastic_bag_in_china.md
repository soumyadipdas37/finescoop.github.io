A newborn baby has been deserted by her mother on the side of pavement in China after the 19-year-old parent said she was unmarried and couldn’t afford to raise the child.

The naked girl was lying inside a black plastic bag when she was discovered on the street by a passer-by who heard the baby crying in eastern Chinese province Zhejiang.

The healthy infant had been born less than two days ago when she was taken to a local hospital for examination, police said.

A newborn baby has been deserted by her mother on the side of pavement in Zhejiang, China, after the 19-year-old parent said she was unmarried and couldn’t afford to raise the child

The Chinese mother has been detained by the authorities under the suspicion of abandonment while her daughter is believed to be looked after by family members.

The deserted baby girl was found by a resident, known by his surname Luo, in the city of Zhuji on August 16.

Mr Luo was walking towards the factory he worked at when he suddenly heard a baby’s crying, reported local media.

He was shocked to see a naked infant wrapped inside a black plastic bag, along with a few pieces of clothing, on the side of the road.

Police officers were called to the scene and took the young child to a local hospital for examination.

Doctors said the baby was healthy and had been only born less than 72 hours ago.

During the police investigation, the officials spotted the parent on CCTV footage. She is seen walking and looking around as she carried the black plastic bag with her daughter inside.

The woman, known by her pseudonym Xiao Qin, admitted to the incident when the authorities approached her at her workplace.

The 19-year-old migrant worker had moved to the eastern Chinese city from central China to seek employment last year.

Before leaving her hometown, Xiao Qin broke up with her boyfriend whom she dated for six months. But the woman found out that she was expecting a baby soon after arriving in Zhuji.

Xiao Qin decided to abandon the baby because she couldn’t afford to raise the child on her own. She then wrapped the newborn baby in the plastic bag and dumped her on the pavement just hours after the labour. The picture shows Xiao Qin visiting her daughter at the hospital

Worried about the reaction of her family and friends about her being unmarried and pregnant, Xiao Qin kept the news under wraps. She also wore baggy clothes to work so that her colleagues wouldn’t find out.

On August 15, Xiao Qin’s water suddenly broke while she was working at the factory. She asked her boss for a day off and rushed back to her rented flat.

The young mother eventually gave birth to her daughter at home. She even cut the umbilical cord by herself using a folding knife.

The woman’s ex-boyfriend refused to take care of the child following the incident. Her family had travelled to Zhuji to deal with the matter and look after the baby girl, according to reports.

Xiao Qin has been detained by the police after she was suspected of abandonment, the authorities said. A further investigation is ongoing.
