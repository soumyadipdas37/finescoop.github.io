Schitt's Creek was the big winner of the night at the 72nd Annual Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday evening.

However, the cast celebrated in their native-Canada, where they held their own special Emmys party as they took home an impressive seven awards on the evening, sweeping the comedy category.Â 

It all culminated when the Pop TV sitcom took home Outstanding Comedy Series as it was the first time the comedy categories have been swept since Modern Family in 2014.

Big win: Schitt's Creek swept the board with SEVEN Emmy Awards on Sunday night... as the cast, including Catherine O'Hara above, held their own socially-distanced party in Canada

The series beat out Curb Your Enthusiasm, Dead to Me ,The Good Place, Insecure, The Kominsky Method, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and What We Do in the Shadows.

Creators and father-son duo Eugene and Daniel Levy accepted the honor together as the son took time to urge viewers to vote.

Daniel said: 'Oh, boy. Our show at its core is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance. We need it now more than ever before. If you have not registered to vote, please do so, and then go out and vote.'

Party: The cast were seen having their own Emmy Awards party in Canada, where the show is filmed

'That's the only way we need love and acceptance out there. Dad, do the rest of the fun stuff, sorry for making this political.'

His father then took the microphone to thank production and the networks involved in the show before focusing on his son.

Eugene ended his speech by saying: 'I also want to thank once again this young man, who took our fish out of water story about the rose family and transformed it into a celebration of inclusivity, a castigation of homophobia, and a declaration of the power of love. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, academy, thank you.'

The sitcoms big run began with Catherine O'Hara earned the very first awards of the night which was presented by Jennifer Aniston and host Jimmy Kimmel.

She faced stiff competition in the Lead Actress in a Comedy Series category including Christina Applegate (Dead to Me), Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Linda Cardellini (Dead to Me), Issa Rae (Insecure), and Tracee Ellis Ross (Black-ish).

Catherine said: 'Thank you for nominating me, and for topping off this fun evening with a trophy treat. I'll forever be grateful to Eugene and Daniel Levy for giving me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to be fully her ridiculous self.

'They gathered the most fun-loving people in Toronto, and led us to be the best we can be for each other. But I must pay an especially big tribute to Debra Hanson, our wardrobe whisperer. And my makeup angel, and to our hair wrangler. Every day, they made me who I thought I was. And I would be an ungrateful person not to share it with them.'

Catherine's big win only began Schitt's Creek's massive night as the sitcom, which aired on Pop TV, took home the first five awards of the night.

Eugene Levy was next as he won Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

The 73-year-old Canadian actor beat out heavy competition including Anthony Anderson (Black-ish), Don Cheadle (Black Monday), Ted Danson (The Good Place), Michael Douglas (The Kominsky Method), and Ramy Youssef (Ramy).

As Schitt's Creek was created by Eugene and his son Daniel - who was next to win an award - he made sure to credit his child during his speech as he said: 'That brings me to my multi Emmy nominated partner, Daniel Levy.

'Who took our show and brilliantly guided it to this little Emmy party tonight. Thank you, son. Thank you, academy. And to my fellow Emmy nominees, it was an honor to be in your company. Thank you.'

Daniel, 37, won in the Writing In A Comedy Series category against Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil (What We Do In The Shadows), Tony McNamara (The Great), Stefani Robinson (What We Do In The Shadows), Michael Schur (The Good Place), Paul Simms (What We Do In The Shadows, and David West Read (Schitt's Creek).

Perhaps an even bigger audience will be able to watch the show soon as Fox Television Studios recently scored the rights to syndicate the show, which is set to air all seasons starting from later this month.
