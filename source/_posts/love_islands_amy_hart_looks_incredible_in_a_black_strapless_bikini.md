Amy Hart was making the most of the last of the summer sunshine in Portugal on Monday. 

The former Love Island star, 27, slipped her incredible figure into a strapless black two-piece as she strutted her stuff in the sunshine. 

She soon found the perfect place to catch some rays as she reclined on a surfboard in the water.

Earlier in the day, Amy had made sure she was sun safe by wearing a stylish white hat to keep out the rays and oversized sunglasses. 

As much as she loves the sun, Amy has been doing her bit for her health by treating herself to cryotherapy sessions. 

Cryotherapy, uses low temperatures in medical therapy for around 3–5 minutes.

Her trip comes after Amy proved there were no hard feelings with ex Curtis Pritchard as the former flames happily posed for a snap together late last month. 

The blonde beauty cosied up to Curtis, 24, in a sweet snap captioned: 'Nostalgia babes x', five months after his split from fellow Islander Maura Higgins, 29.

Curtis also posted a snap of the pair, captioned:'Good to see you x @amyhartxo.'

In the wake of the reunion Amy has now re-followed her ex Curtis on Instagram.

Later on the evening, Amy looked a little worse for wear as she put on an animated display and hung onto her friend while leaving the Proud Embankment venue after the boozy Cabaret All Stars Show in London.

Curtis, a professional ballroom dancer with a talent for tango, left Amy devastated after he started to chase after single Islander Jourdan Riane while Amy was away in Casa Amor.

Former air-stewardess Amy then told producers she wanted to leave the August series, after her 'half-boyfriend' split with her and began to chase after Islander Maura, who he went on to date, but split from in March.
