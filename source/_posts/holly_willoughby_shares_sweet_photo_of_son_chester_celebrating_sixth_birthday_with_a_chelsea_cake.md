Holly Willoughby celebrated her youngest son Chester’s sixth birthday on Monday, and gushed that she was immensely proud of his choice of cake.

The mum of three shared a sweet photo of her son preparing to blow out the candles on his Chelsea football club cake, alongside a hilarious message explaining how upset her husband Dan Baldwin was by the choice of decoration.

‘If anyone knows my @arsenal loving husband you’ll know how much this Cake for Chesters birthday is killing him,’ Holly explained.

The doting mum continued: ‘However that’s our boy all over... marching to the beat of his own drum, spreading absolute joy wherever he goes ... we love you so very much Chester Chops... how is my beautiful baby 6 already!’

Frank soon responded to the mention on Holly’s insta, writing in the comments: ‘Happy Birthday Chester my little Chelsea friend! The boy just has amazing taste in his football teams. Next stop a Chelsea cake for Dan on his birthday and my work is done. Hope he has a great day. X’

Holly and Dan are also parents to Harry, 11 and Belle, nine, and has given regular updates on family life in 2020 as they made it through lockdown and the return to school.

In June the ITV star defended herself after taking a day off work at This Morning to take her trio back to school after three months off in lockdown.

Holly explained that it was a strange experience as she was 'relinquishing control' over her three children after spending every day with them during lockdown.

She said: 'Do you know what it is? I've been with them the whole time. I know exactly what they've done, what they've eaten and what they've learnt… it's like having them back as babies. I've known everything.

'Then yesterday, suddenly they were doing stuff I didn't know about. It was like relinquishing control.'

Her co-host Phillip Schofield then asked Holly whether her three children turned around to look back at her after being dropped off at school. 

To which she revealed: 'Chester did. The other two didn't, I was like that [she pretended to look around and wave]. They just disappeared but Chester, a couple of times, looked back.

'I think it was weird as they go in, they hand over their health and safety form, get their temperature checked. Then a bit of anti-bac, it's like, "Oh, this is a bit weird". But it was all good and very upbeat, which was nice.'
