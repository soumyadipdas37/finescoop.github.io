Detailing her own experience, she said: 'I chose to come back from the hospital and have [the miscarriage] at home. It wasn't pleasant it was long and awful, Mark was with me.

She continued: 'Mark was in real bits, I went to this strange place where I phoned everyone up, my family live next door. I rang everyone up and said get me some chickens and potatoes, I'm going to do a roast dinner.'

'This poor man [Mark] was just reeling. But that was my way, in a microcosm it's a similar kind of thing, I wasn't in my right mind when I did that. I was a bit in shock.'

Relating her ordeal to Chrissy's, she said: 'I wonder if they're in such shock that because they share stuff it's on a wider level because it's social media.'

'I often think about that, it must have really hard for Mark because I just did what I needed. We were in the same position even though he hadn't physically done it.'

Jane Moore commented: 'Was it a form of distraction for you? You have an emotional attachment for you with food you cook whether happy or bereaved.'

While Nadia explained: 'I was exhausted, I should have rested, but I wasn't going to let Mark tell me, I just wonder... if a bit of that comes into it because they're reeling and it shock.'

'News gets out so fast with these stars, they probably wanted to control it. They are a rock solid couple. My heart really goes out to them.' 

Chrissy announced she and her husband John had lost their baby on Thursday, days after she was admitted to the hospital with severe bleeding.

The model, 34, shared the heartbreaking news with a lengthy post and series of images on social media on Wednesday night, saying their little boy, 'Jack', has died following 'so many complications'.   

Chrissy wrote in her post: 'We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn't enough'. 

Jane Moore commented: 'Was it a form of distraction for you? You have an emotional attachment for you with food you cook whether happy or bereaved'

The devastating post included five black and white photos taken at the hospital, showing Chrissy crying on her bed as well as a shot showing her and John cradling their son.  

On Monday, Chrissy, who conceived daughter Luna, four, and son Miles, two, through IVF with John, 41, revealed she was on 'serious bed rest' due to bleeding and said she was 'about halfway through her pregnancy', which is around 20 - 24 weeks. 

A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead at 24 weeks or later.

In a heartbreaking addition to the post, Chrissy revealed that 'for some reason' she and John had begun calling their unborn baby boy, 'Jack' despite only naming their other kids after they were born.

She continued: 'We never decide on our babies' names until the last possible moment after they're born, just before we leave the hospital. But we, for some reason, had started to call this little guy in my belly Jack. So he will always be Jack to us. Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever...

'To our Jack - I'm so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn't give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you...

'Thank you to everyone who has been sending us positive energy, thoughts and prayers. We feel all of your love and truly appreciate you. We are so grateful for the life we have, for our wonderful babies Luna and Miles, for all the amazing things we’ve been able to experience.'
