There are at least three people in the car in the video which was posted on the Norton and Billingham Info page on Facebook. 

The car waits for a pedestrian out walking their dog to pass the car, then they drive straight towards the fountain in the centre.

One man shouts 'beep beep' as ducks fly out of the way of the oncoming vehicle as it ploughs into the pond. 

The man taking the video instructs the driver, who he calls Craig, to 'do a couple of laps' of the pond as people in the park watch

A family watch the car as it careers through the water, and jokes 'you soaked them' as they attempt to exit the pond.
