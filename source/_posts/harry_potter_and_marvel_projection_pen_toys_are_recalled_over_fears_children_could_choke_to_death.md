Harry Potter and Marvel toys have been recalled over fears children could choke on their batteries. 

The projection pens were recalled by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Wednesday. 

There are fears the pens' batteries could become dislodged and children could either eat them - causing internal burns - or choke on them. 

More to come.
