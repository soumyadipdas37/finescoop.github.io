Tennis legend Boris Becker has slammed Nick Kyrgios as a 'loudmouth' for trolling other players on social media.

Kyrgios has been taking pot shots at tennis stars from behind his computer screen after choosing not to participate in the US Open because of COVID-19. 

But his back seat driving is infuriating the tennis greats, including German six-time grand slam champion Becker.  

The tennis badboy (pictured with girlfriend Chiara Passari) has been highly active on social media since deciding not to travel to New York for the US open

The tennis great threw down his gloves in an interview with Eurosport. 

'Nick Kyrgios should shut up for once,' Becker said.

'He's turning into a loudmouth criticising the players, while he does nothing.

'I don't know any athletes like that.'

The remarks are not his first criticism of Kyrgios, after laying into him only months earlier for his social media behaviour.

Becker called the badboy a 'rat' for outing German Alexander Zverev for partying in Monaco in the midst of the pandemic. 

'Don't like no #rats! Anybody telling off fellow sportsman/woman is no friend of mine! Look yourself in the mirror and think your (sic) better than us... @NickKyrgios,' Becker wrote.

The exchange devolved into Kyrgios calling Becker a 'doughnut' and saying he was 'not the sharpest tool in the shed.'

Becker ultimately changed his tune after the heated exchange.  

'I really would like to see @NickKyrgios fulfill his potential and win a grand slam! He would be an incredible role model for for the youth of the world addressing the issues of equality/race/heritage! Man up buddy and deliver!' Becker said. 

Meanwhile Kyrgios' latest victim on social media was Spanish semi-finalist Pablo Carreno Busta. 

'If clay didn't exist. Dude wouldn't have even been close to top 50,' Kyrgios wrote earlier in the tournament.

The tweet was deleted soon after it was published but not before causing a sparring match between the two.

Spaniard Busta didn't seem overly concerned by Kyrgios' comments, saying he must be 'pretty bored'. 

'When he comes back to tournaments, we will talk about him because he deserves it,' he said.

'And in the meantime, well nothing, he will continue to tweet from home.'

Kyrgios responded to his comments in a post on his Instagram story side by side with his match record with the Spanish player.

'Obviously would love to be playing the US Open but due to conditions didn't feel comfortable. Yes Carreno Busta I'm a little bored and I would rather be chopping you again. 2-0,' he wrote.

He also recently shared criticism of the sporting code's punishment of Serbian player Njovak Djokovic for hitting a linesperson with a ball.

'Swap me for jokers incident. 'Accidentally hitting the ball kid in the throat' how many years would I be banned for?' he wrote.

Photos show him playing playing video games and spending significant amounts of time with his new girlfriend Chiara Passari.  

Kyrgios is yet to announce whether he'll play in the delayed French Open later this month but recently admitted the chances of him playing at Roland Garros are 'slim to none'.

'I don't think at the moment I'm really comfortable going anywhere with the current conditions,' Kyrgios told reporters earlier this week.

'I don't really see any real improvement going on in my eye at the moment but at the same time I don't think it's the best time for sport to be going ahead also.

Fellow Australian Ash Barty announced earlier this week she has made the 'difficult' decision to not defend her French Open crown, her maiden grand slam.
