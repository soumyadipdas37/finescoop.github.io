One of the Government's chief legal officers has offered his resignation to Boris Johnson over the Prime Minister's controversial Brexit plans, it was claimed today. 

Lord Keen of Elie, the Advocate General for Scotland, is said to have offered to quit amid a rumbling row caused by Mr Johnson's proposals to tear up parts of the Brexit divorce deal. 

The resignation offer from Lord Keen, who serves as the UK Government's law officer for Scotland, is said to not yet have been accepted by Number 10. 

There is speculation that the Government is trying to persuade Lord Keen to stay in his post. 

The claims came after Lord Keen clashed with Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis over the legality of the Prime Minister's plans. 

Lord Keen of Elie, the Advocate General for Scotland, has reportedly offered his resignation to the Prime Minister over the Government's Brexit plans

Mr Lewis told MPs last week that the measures contained within the UK Internal Market Bill will 'break international law in a very specific and limited way'.   

But yesterday Lord Keen said the Northern Ireland Secretary 'answered the wrong question'. 

Speaking in the House of Lords, the peer said that the legislation does not 'constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law'.  

He said: 'I have satisfied myself as to the correct legal position in this context.

'It is my view that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland essentially answered the wrong question.'

But Mr Lewis hit back this morning as he gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee. 

He told MPs: 'I have spoken to Lord Keen and I have to say… looking at the specific question my honourable friend asked me last week, he agrees the answer I gave was the correct answer.' 

Mr Lewis reiterated that the Government's official legal advice to ministers is that overriding key parts of the Brexit divorce deal would break international law. 

He maintained that his assertion in the Commons last week was 'absolutely in line' with the views of top lawyers advising the Government. 

The minister said: 'I gave a very straight answer to Parliament last week in line with the Attorney General's position.

'My position is absolutely in line with the legal advice that the Attorney General put out.'

The claims of Lord Keen offering his resignation come one week after Sir Jonathan Jones quit as Treasury Solicitor and Head of the Government Legal Profession. 

He reportedly resigned over Mr Johnson's plans to depart from parts of the divorce accord struck with Brussels.
