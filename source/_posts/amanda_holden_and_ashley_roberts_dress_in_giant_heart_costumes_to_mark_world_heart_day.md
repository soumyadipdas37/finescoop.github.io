Amanda Holden and Ashley Roberts got into the spirit of World Heart Day as they dressed up in heart costumes on Tuesday.

The Heart radio presenters showed off their playful side as they struck a series of dramatic poses Ashley shared on Instagram.

The pair both had large hearts around their torsos while the outfit also featured skintight leggings and matching long-sleeved gloves.

Amanda, 49, and Ashley, 39, also wore heart headbands in the snaps as they posed in front of a bright red wall in Global Studios.

The Pussycat Dolls star wrote: 'Well... we got the memo that it’s #worldheartday❤️ Let’s motivate each other to get our hearts pumpin hunni’s'. 

World Heart Day aims to raise awareness about the risks of cardiovascular disease and is held every year on September 29.

Amanda and co-host Jamie Theakston were joined by Dr Hazel Wallace, founder of The Food Medic, on Tuesday's show, who spoke to Heart listeners about heart health.

It comes after Amanda sparked Ofcom complaints from Britain's Got Talent viewers, with 235 people contacting the company over her look in Saturday's show.

The star wowed in a showstopping metallic navy gown during the fourth semi-final, but at the time some fans questioned if she had suffered a wardrobe malfunction after they claimed to 'see her nipples'.

According to a report from The Mirror on Monday, the regulator received 277 complaints about the programme, with the majority focusing on her racy ensemble which featured a plunging neckline and was boned to accentuate her cleavage.

Amanda's gown featured a sweetheart neckline and was cinched around her svelte waist, teamed with a pair of sparkling silver barely-there heels.

One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'

Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'

Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?'

MailOnline has contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment.
