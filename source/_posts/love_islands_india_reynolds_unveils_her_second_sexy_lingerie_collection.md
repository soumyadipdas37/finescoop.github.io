India Reynolds has proved once again exactly why she was a hit in the Love Island villa by unveiling her latest lingerie collection - and posing for an accompanying shoot.

The sultry brunette has released eight new pieces from her second India Loves range, in collaboration with popular lingerie brand Pour Moi. 

And she gave fans a taste of what to expect from the collection on Friday afternoon by modelling every piece in series of sultry new photos.

India, who struggled to accept her body when she was younger, looks stunning as she shows off her figure in the highly distinctive range of one and two pieces, released just in time for the Christmas stampede.  

Reflecting on her latest collection, she said: 'The 2nd drop is a lot sexier in the run up to Christmas! Loads of the bras are designed to be seen and they look gorgeous with a blazer, but also beautiful sets for the bedroom too. 

'There’s some suspenders which I love and some really feminine lace. We’ve got a new sheer satin bralette too which I think will be my fave piece!'

Pour Moi’s CEO and Founder Michael Thompson added: 'We are super excited to be launching the second drop from our India Loves Pour Moi range. 

'Her fans have been loving the collection and we are thrilled! It was so important to us that all these new pieces encapsulated her style, sassiness and sense of fun. 

'And for this second drop, we are marrying sexy sets with worn to be seen styles, with shapes to suit everybody! We hope you love them as much as we do.' 

Staying neutral: The new collection comes exclusively in black, India's favourite colour
