Fears have been shared after a horrified woman described the moment a gang tried to kidnap her child from her pram.

The woman was shopping TK Maxx with her siblings in Crewe, Cheshire, when she says a gang of three women and one man started to follow her round the shop.

In a warning to other parents shared on social media, the sister said one of the gang 'tried to rip' the one-year-old from the pram before they fled the scene.

She wrote: 'I can't believe these four people tried to chore my one-year-old baby sister.

'They tried to rip her out the pram and followed the children around the shop. I'm reporting it to the police.'

The post attracted hundreds of comments, with one worried Facebook user adding: 'Same thing happened to us a month ago, tried to rip the child out through the back window on the car and we were sat in it.'

The post quickly attracted hundreds of comments leading to another woman coming forward according to Stoke on Trent Live.

She said: 'I was in Aldi earlier with my 17-week-old baby and they were acting so weirdly, leaning into his pram staring at him and watching my every move.

'They were following me around the store and I left in the end because of them!

'I honestly think if he didn't have the rain cover over him for COVID reasons, they would have fully reached in and tried to take him too.

'They were acting so weird, watching my every move and staring at my baby into the pram. They made me feel so uncomfortable.

'I was staring the woman out to let her know I saw what she was doing and to back off but they wouldn't leave me and my baby alone.

'It really freaked me out, it's definitely the same people.'  

A spokesman for Cheshire Police said they were aware of the report and added:' The incident has not been reported to us and we would encourage anyone with any information to report this to Cheshire Police via 101 or https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report'

It comes after reports there had been at least six kidnapping attempts in Worcester after men in a silver car tried to kidnap women and girls on six occasions since September 10.

On Sunday, a 15-year-old girl told police a car full of men had pulled up along side her while she walked to the shops and one had attempted to grab her.
