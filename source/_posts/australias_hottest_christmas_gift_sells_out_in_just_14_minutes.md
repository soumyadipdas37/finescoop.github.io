'WTF how do they sell out if the website crashes constantly. I was at checkout within 10 secs of it rolling out,' another added.

'What the hell EB?! I was 1 minute past 8 and your payment system kept on crashing,' a third customer replied.

Some gamers complained they were getting error notifications during the pre-sale launch, before being informed stock had sold out. 

'Bitterly disappointed! It’s a disgrace,' one customer wrote on Twitter.

'And to think I missed out because your site wouldn't work,' another added.

The Series X and Series S are the next generation of gaming console from Microsoft. Both consoles are scheduled for wider release on November 10.

At release the Series X will sell for $749 while the Series S will sell for $499.
