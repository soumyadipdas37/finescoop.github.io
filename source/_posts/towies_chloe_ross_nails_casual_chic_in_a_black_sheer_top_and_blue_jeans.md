She regularly puts on a sultry display on social media as an Ann Summers brand ambassador.

And Chloe Ross opted for a casual look as she enjoyed a day out with a group of friends at Sketch in Mayfair over the weekend.

The former TOWIE star, 27, appeared in good spirits after enjoying cocktails with her pals and departed the venue in a black sheer top with a knot around her waist that displayed her taut abdomen.

The garment featured a collar and a lined detail while Chloe also sported a pair of blue jeans for the outing.

The TV star wore a pair of black flats and carried a matching handbag while she added to her outfit with gold hoop earrings.

Chloe completed her look for the outing by styling her brunette locks into a ponytail.  

Chloe's former castmates have been filming the new series of ITVBe's The Only Way Is Essex, which celebrates the show's 10-year anniversary in recent weeks.

The 10th anniversary series was due to start filming in March 2020, but ITV bosses made the tough decision to put the production on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fans were left without their Essex fix until the show came back with a vengeance on Sunday night, with former cast member Amy Childs returning.

There will also be surprise appearances from some of the show's other big stars from the past decade.  

Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels and Acquisitions for ITV, added: 'After 10 years, TOWIE is still going strong and remains the number one show on ITVBe.

'We're thrilled to be welcoming back new and old faces for the upcoming mega-series as the show celebrates this special anniversary.'
