She recently lamented England's soon-to-enforced 'six person rule', as she worried about being able to spend Christmas with both of her parents.

And Holly Willoughby was spotted enjoying some quality time with her family on Saturday, when she stepped out for a lavish lunch in London with her mother Lynne, husband Dan Baldwin, and three children Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five.

The TV presenter, 39, looked typically chic in a form-fitting sweater, over which she draped a matching tweed coat, as she made her way to The Ivy Chelsea Garden.

Teaming her ensemble with a high-waisted skirt and green suede heels, the star accessorised with a black leather handbag and stylish sunglasses.

With her golden locks styled into a ponytail, the This Morning host highlighted her good looks with a fresh and light palette of makeup.

After her family meal, she was seen arranging for everybody to head home in cabs – because of the five-person limit amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they left in two taxis.

Her outing comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.

Talking on Thursday's This Morning, she asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, over the yuletide season, due to having a family of five.   

From Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'.

Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. 

Holly has three children with husband Dan, meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. 

Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'A lot of people are thinking, "What will this mean for Christmas? What will Christmas look like?"

'It's going to be very awkward in my house as I'm a family-of-five, so I'll have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas day!'  

To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom. 

'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'

With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'
