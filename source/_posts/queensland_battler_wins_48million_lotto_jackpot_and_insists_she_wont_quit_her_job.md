A self-confessed 'battler' who hit The Lott jackpot has revealed how it will change her life - and that does not include quitting her job. 

The woman, from Proserpine, 20 minutes inland from Airlie Beach in Queensland's Whitsundays, won division one of Set For Life draw 1850 on Saturday and will be given $20,000 every month over the next two decades.

She will pocket a total of $4.8million by 2040, and she was 'completely speechless' when she found out.

Set For Life is the only game in Australia where people can play numbers across seven daily draws.

There have been 65 division one winners since the game launched in 2015, including the woman from Central Queensland. 

The woman's five-game QuickPick was purchased at Fresh Fields News & Gifts, 89 Main Street, Proserpine (pictured) 

'I can't believe this has happened to me. I never in a million years thought I would win division one,' the woman said, according to The Lott.

'This is incredible. It's absolutely incredible. 

'I have to come back down to earth. I am at work right now.'

The woman received the call from The Lott officials on Monday and said her plans would be to 'definitely finish the day at work.'

'I can't let my team down. But I will celebrate later today.'

While the woman needed time to think about how the winnings would change her life, she was adamant she would continue working but conceded she 'might cut back a bit'. 

'I might do some volunteering instead,' she said.

The woman told The Lott she would also 'share some with my family too' and donate to charity - but not before buying herself a new car.

'I just don't even know what I will do with the rest of the prize,' she said.

'I won't be worried about looking out for things on sale now though.

'We've always been battlers, so this changes everything for my family.'

The woman's five-game QuickPick was purchased at Fresh Fields News & Gifts, 89 Main Street, Proserpine.  

Owner Barbara Cochrane said it was the first division one entry since July last year.

She has been sharing the 'good news' with her customers and 'the staff are going to celebrate with a cold beverage.' 

'Since we took ownership, we have had three major wins in three years,' Ms Cochrane said. 

'We would like to send our congratulations and best wishes to our winner, and we would like to say thank you for supporting our store.

'This win is very exciting and it is great to have something positive to focus on in these uncertain times.'
