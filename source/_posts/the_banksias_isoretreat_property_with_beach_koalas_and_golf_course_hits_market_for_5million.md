A luxurious 48.5 hectare retreat with a nine-hole golf course, tennis court and private waterway that leads out to 6km of beachfront is expected to sell for $5 million.  

The Banksias retreat on 1126 Point Plomer Road in Crescent Head on the NSW North Coast is also home to native wildlife such as kangaroos, koalas, black swans and river ducks. 

Christie's International Real Estate agent Bruce Eason said the property is attracting international millionaires from the US, Asia and Europe as well as potential buyers from Queensland and NSW.  

'It's a very unique location, the privacy is just fantastic. There's not really anything else like it in the area,' Mr Eason told Daily Mail Australia.

Eight bedrooms across the homestead, detached honeymoon suite and four private cabins can 'accommodate up to 18 guests comfortably', according to the property description. 

Guests can reach the beach by walking, taking a golf cart or by launching a kayak or boat off the pontoon onto the 1km private waterway and cruising out to sea. 

'That waterway is actually on the property. The boundary goes to the far edge of the river, so the river is completely part of the property and stretches for about one kilometre,' Mr Eason said. 

An outdoor dining table, lounge and fire pit overlooks the private waterway. There is also an outdoor kitchen, BBQ and even a woodfire pizza oven to cook up a feast

There is also a multi-media outdoor room to watch movies and multiple external lounge areas to sit outside while indoors, there is another kitchen, seven bathrooms and a four-car garage.

Mr Eason said 'an isolated retreat is the perfect way to describe the property'.

'The current owners mainly use it as a private family retreat but they have been renting it out in recent times and the holiday lettings have been extremely strong in recent months. There is an element of COVID in that,' he said.  

The property's tennis court is completely floodlit to play at night. Christie's International Real Estate agent Bruce Eason said it could be used for a tennis camp, a wedding venue, a golf or yoga retreat, wellness spa or eco lodge

'We have had strong interest from overseas and strong interest in Australia, particularly from Queensland as well,' he said. 

'The majority of overseas interest has come from the States, Asia - Hong Kong in the main and a couple from Europe as well.'
