They were axed by their Sky Sports bosses on the eve of the season. But it hasn't taken too long for Soccer Saturday trio Phil Thompson, Charlie Nicholas and Matt Le Tissier to find work again.

Bookmakers Paddy Power have signed the trio up for their own rival scores show - called 'Pundits' - but things don't exactly go to plan.

The hilarious spoof of Sky's massively popular Saturday afternoon show - imaginatively titled 'Score Saturday' - sees the old team back together.

They decide to call their new shot 'Score Saturday' but the budget doesn't quite match Sky's

The first episode of 'Pundits' starts with Le Tissier and Thompson discussing the programme

But instead of Jeff Stelling anchoring things, it's Alan Curbishley reeling off the stats - or attempting to - as the whole thing is filmed on an ancient camcorder.

With Sky's resources a thing of the past, the first episode of 'Pundits' sees the panel discuss whether they can get away with watching the Premier League action on dodgy illegal streams.

Southampton legend Le Tissier has an appropriately-named Dell laptop but his updates are ruined by annoying internet buffering.

Thompson, meanwhile, sees his feed constantly interrupted by pop-ups telling him there's hot singles in his area.

Unfortunately, Nicholas doesn't really fancy being a pundit and wants to become a comedian 

When the action starts, Thompson finds their use of dodgy streams isn't good for updates

Stelling admitted he nearly walked away from the show after his 'best mates' were sacked 

And while the team all look smartly suited and booted behind their desks - or should that be a converted snooker table in Nicolas's front room - they're actually sat there in shorts and dodgy trousers.

The plush, hi-tech Sky studios have been replaced by a living room while the 'Score Saturday' sign behind Curbishley's head is no more than a painted bedsheet.

It leaves them all yearning for the old show but they realise they can't watch it because Sky have taken their box away. 

However, a surprise phone call at the end points the way into the future episodes.

Paddy Power plan to release a new episode of the Pundits series every Saturday as the new season gets underway.

There was plenty of controversy when Le Tissier, Nicholas and Thompson were shown the door after years of Soccer Saturday service.

Host Stelling described their dismissals as the 'saddest day ever' and admitted he considered quitting himself before the trio told him to continue.

Sky's decision led to a torrent of vile abuse on social media with most of it directed at Sky pundit and former Arsenal women's star Alex Scott even though she hadn't been lined up for the show.

That has left Stelling concerned that women who do appear on Soccer Saturday are open targets for abuse.

Sue Smith will be part of the revamped Soccer Saturday line-up, however, alongside regulars Chris Kamara, Alan McInally and Paul Merson plus newcomers Clinton Morrison and Glen Johnson.

Special guests throughout the season will include Adebayo Akinfenwa, Robbie Fowler, Tim Sherwood and Joleon Lescott as the show is freshened up.
