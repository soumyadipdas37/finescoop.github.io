Sarah Jessica Parker opened her flagship shoe store -- SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker Collection -- in New York City in early July.

And on Thursday the Sex And The City star paid a visit to the midtown location at 31 West 54th St., looking casual cool in baggy military-green pants and a grey v-neck shirt.

Parker paired the ensemble by wearing black-patterned knee-high boots.

Sarah Jessica Parker, 55, gave a friendly wave when she was spotted walking towards her Midtown Manhattan shoe store on Thursday

The actress and entrepreneur, 55, appeared to not have a care in the world when she was first spotted walking down the street towards her shoppe with headphones on.

She looked nearly unrecognizable with large-rimmed sunglasses and a purple protective mask over her mouth and nose amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

On this day, the Ohio native pulled her golden blonde tresses back into a braided ponytail as she carried a backpack and small purse over her shoulders.

Parker makes regular visits to her New York City stores, which also includes a location near the South Street Seaport in Downtown Manhattan.

She sometimes will take to her social media platforms to let her fans and followers know when she will be greeting shoppers in person.

With the coronavirus crisis still very much a concern, precautions have been taken to keep customers safe, with only three shoppers allowed in at a time and hand sanitizer available.

In all there are eight SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker Collection stores that includes Las Vegas, Oxon Hill, Maryland near Washington, D.C., Edmonton, Canada and three in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The SJP Collection was first launched in 2014, and not only includes footwear but handbags and fragrances. 

Parker and husband Matthew Broderick have lived in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Downtown NYC since 2009.

They are parents to a son James, 17, and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, 11.
