One in eight state school students did not go back when classrooms reopened after this month the coronavirus lockdown, according to official figures.  

Approximately 88 per cent of state school pupils were back in class last Thursday, meaning that 12 per cent of children were marked absence.

Figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) indicate that this is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of around five per cent, but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid outbreaks.  

Around a quarter of schools did not supply information, as school leaders warn that delays in testing are leading to year groups being sent home.

Government guidance states that school attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the autumn term, while pupils or members of their households with coronavirus symptoms should not attend school. 

 If someone who has attended school is tested positive for Covid-19, pupils they have been in close contact with will be asked to self-isolate.   

Schools are considered not fully open if they are unable to provide face-to-face teaching for all pupils on roll for the whole school day.

For most schools that reported they were not fully open, this was due to non-Covid-19 related reasons, the DfE release suggests.

Of all schools that responded, one per cent said they were not fully open due to suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus. 

In early years settings, attendance figures were much lower, with 37 per cent of children who usually attend childcare in attendance on this date.

The DfE said it expected the figures for early years to settle in a few weeks, as some early years providers had started the term with inset days.

Just 18,000 children aged 0 to 4 classed as vulnerable were in early years settings, representing 21 per cent of children in this age group classified as 'Children in Need' or who have an Education, Health and Care Plan.

It comes as another 300 schools in England and Wales have sent class groups home after receiving positive test results.

What has gone wrong with coronavirus testing in the UK?

People across England are struggling to get access for swab tests which are used to confirm whether or not they have Covid-19. 

These should be available on the day at drive/walk-through centres or by mail order but many have reported being unable to get them, and instead being met by a 'service busy' message on the booking website.

This is even reportedly a problem in areas with local lockdowns, where testing is crucial and mobile test sites are set up to speed up the process.

Why are tests not available for everyone who wants them? 

The Government's testing system is still not set up to cope with the surging demand now being placed on it. 

It was never advanced enough to offer everyone a test, which is why only people with symptoms are supposed to book the swabs.

Numbers of people catching the virus are rising across the country and the number of people wanting tests is increasing as a result.

Although the Department of Health claims it can process 243,817 swab tests per day, the system is stalling at a lower level – 205,659 were done on Thursday, September 10, the most recent data. 

Health officials have blamed laboratory capacity for the shortage, and the testing chief at NHS Test & Trace apologised for this last week.

Is a lack of staff in labs really to blame? 

One suggestion is that labs may not have enough technical staff able to operate the machines that process the swabs. 

More labs are being set up and more staff employed, but this could take weeks or months to translate to big gains in testing capacity.

One of the scientists who helped set up the system, however, has rejected this and said labs are operating normally and 'there are problems elsewhere in the chain'.

The University of Birmingham's Professor Alan McNally said on BBC Breakfast: 'The labs are still fully staffed, they are still churning through huge amounts of samples per day - the same number as they were a couple of months ago - so there are problems elsewhere in the chain...

'I think this is multi-factorial. I think you almost have a perfect storm of events that have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system.

'I think there is a surge in demand [and] I think our stated capacity is very different from actually how many tests can be run in a given day.'

What is the impact of growing pressure on test labs?

A large workload for testing labs around the UK means that people's results are taking longer to process – many people have to wait more than the target 24 hours to find out their result.

This means that the government is throttling the number of tests that are sent out, to avoid completely overwhelming the system, so people in some areas are finding it difficult to access swabs. 

There are concerns that a system that is frustrating or slow to use will put people off and members of the public will stop bothering to use it. 

Should people still be ordering tests?

Yes, anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus (a cough, fever or lost sense of taste/smell) must order a test however they can. People who do not have symptoms, and have not been instructed by a medical professional to get tested, should not order a test.

No walk-in, drive-in or postal coronavirus tests are available for people with symptoms of the disease in England's 10 outbreak hotspots, it was claimed yesterday.

Swabs are not available in Bolton, which is fighting the largest outbreak of the virus in the country with an infection rate of 122 cases for every 100,000 people.

The leader of the council in Bolton, which has Britain's highest infection rate, said there were 'major flaws' with the online booking system and that it was out of the council's control because the Government runs it. He said the issue was 'unacceptable'.
