A Fort Bragg paratrooper has died in a training accident in Georgia, Army officials announced.

The paratrooper, with the 82nd Airborne Division, was killed during jump training at Fort Stewart in Georgia around 7pm on Wednesday.

'It is with a heavy Airborne heart that we announce the death of one of our paratroopers in a training accident,' Lt. Col. Mike Burns, a spokesperson for Fort Bragg in North Carolina said.

The unidentified soldier was assigned to the division’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team at Bragg.

Further details including the soldier’s identity is being withheld until 24 hours after next of kin had been notified.

The incident is currently under investigation, according to officials. 

The death comes just one day after the 82nd Airborne Division announced another paratrooper, Sgt. David Eugene Hughes, who passed away on Friday in a tragic motorcycle accident.

Hughes, 32, of Fresno, California was an unmanned aerial vehicle operator assigned to the division’s A Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment.

He crashed while riding his 2015 BMW motorcycle down Raeford Road just before midnight.

'The shock of his sudden passing has been felt throughout the formation,' Lt. Col. Margaret Stick, commander of the squadron, said.

'Although only with the formation for a few short months, his professionalism, competence and caring demeanor made him an invaluable member of the team — a true friend and mentor. He will be greatly missed.'
