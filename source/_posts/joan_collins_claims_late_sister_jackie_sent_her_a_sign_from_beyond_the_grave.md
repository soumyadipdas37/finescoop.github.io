Joan Collins has claimed that her late sister Jackie sent her a message from beyond the grave five years after her death. 

Author Jackie Collins died at the age of 77 in September 2015, following a six-year battle with breast cancer, and her sister Joan today appeared on Loose Women from her London home to discuss the fifth anniversary of her death this week.

She explained that after hearing of her sister's death, Joan, 87, and her husband Percy noticed a power cut in her village, which caused all the lights in the room to turn off. 

After the same thing happened at her home last night, Joan felt her sister was sending a message to her, saying, 'I'm here'.

'I know it's really terribly sad seeing those clips of Jackie,' she said. 'She had such a wild sense of humour. By the time she was a little girl she always had a quip or a joke. 

'She was a perfect sister and this is very sad week for us. 

'And something very strange happened last night. When I first heard about Jackie's death, which was exactly five years ago, [my husband] Percy and I were watching television and all of the lights went off in the village where we are – complete black out. 

'Last night, the same thing happened. All of the lights went out. It was really scary – and exactly five years before. I do believe that maybe there was some kind of force that was saying, "I'm here". I don't know.' 

While Joan lives in the UK and her sister was based in Los Angeles, Joan explained that they would often send each other letters and call each other. Pictured, the sisters in London in the 1970s

While Joan lives in the UK and her sister was based in Los Angeles, Joan explained that they would often send each other letters and call each other. 

Dame Joan continued: 'I miss Jackie because, first of all, even though we were not necessarily close physically a lot of the time – she was in LA when I was in London – we would call each other all the time and before that we'd send letters.

'Today, I think, "Oh my god, that I must tell Jackie". And of course, I can't tell Jackie.'

The novelist passed away after being diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, but kept her illness almost entirely to herself.  

Speaking of not knowing Jackie was ill, Dame Joan said: 'A couple of years previously I had gone from London to LA and I had seen Jackie. 

The Dynasty legend went on to say that on advice of her doctor she now gets checked once every three to four years

'We'd gone out, she was just as much fun and making jokes as ever, but she'd lost a lot of weight. She seemed a tiny bit frail. 

'I asked her daughter Tiffany, "Is your mother OK?". Tiffany had a momentary glimpse, something I saw, just a half a second. As an actress I saw something she didn't want to reveal.

'In a way I know she wouldn't have wanted me to worry. In fact, she didn't want anybody to know. That was the whole thing.'

Dame Joan added: 'Had I been in LA all this time, I definitely would have known.'  

The Dynasty legend went on to say that on advice of her doctor she now gets checked once every three to four years.

She added: 'I was always very upset afterwards that she didn't go and have a mammogram. We have breast cancer in our family. It's one of those things, if you catch it early enough.'
