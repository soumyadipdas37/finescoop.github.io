Demi's mini dress was ruched and highlighted her hourglass figure to perfection as she posed up a storm for the camera.

The Birmingham native complemented her dress with a chic black and gold Yves Saint Laurent handbag, no doubt full of her essentials.

She wore her brunette locks in a bouncy, flowing style, while highlighting her pretty features with a soft pallet of make-up.

Wow! Demi later slipped into a sequin gown with an equally plunging neckline, which she wore with a gold snake-shape necklace

The snaps come a day after Demi emotionally discussed losing both her parents at 24 and detailed how she copes with her ongoing grief.

She appeared on Sky News on Thursday to talk to Kay Burley in a bid to raise mental health awareness on World Suicide Prevention Day.

Demi lost her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, with tragedy striking again soon after when her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.

Heartbreaking: Demi emotionally discussed losing both her parents at 24 and detailed how she copes with her ongoing grief

Discussing losing both her parents at just 24-years-old, the model said: 'Well, my mother, when I was 17, she had a heart attack which caused a stroke and it left her disabled.

'Then in 2018, my dad passed away from cancer, then my mum, after being sick for so long, she passed away from a stomach infection. So it was really hard.'

Asked how she copes with the grief, Demi said: 'I mean, it was really difficult, I've gone through stages of feeling my worst and now I'm at a place where I feel a lot better. It just takes time really.' 

Discussing what helps her manage her grief, the star said: 'I have some amazing friends and I do meditation. I have a lot of faith, so I pray and sound healing. I love sound healing.'

Sad: The model, 25, appeared on Sky News on Thursday to talk to Kay Burley in a bid to raise mental health awareness on World Suicide Prevention Day

It comes after Demi admitted that her world 'could have spiralled out of control' following the deaths of her parents   

Amid her heartache, the star also discussed her mental health, telling how it almost 'got the better' of her during lockdown, in a candid chat to mark World Suicide Prevention Day.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Demi shared how she's coping with her personal tragedy and reveals how her heartbreaking loss has in a way made her 'stronger'. 

The star revealed how she was forced to 'grow up' from a young age after her mother was left disabled following a heart attack, resulting in a then 17-year-old becoming her carer. 

Grief: Asked how she copes with the grief, Demi said: 'I mean, it was really difficult, I've gone through stages of feeling my worst and now I'm at a place where I feel a lot better. It just takes time really.'

She recalled that after losing her loved ones in quick succession left her 'angry, sad, bitter and lonely', but added that she was 'lucky' that she had a 'good support system' around her and didn't 'bottle up' her grief.  

Admitting that she could have easily succumbed to her anger and grief, Demi said: 'When my parents died my world could have spiralled out of control but you have to hang on.'

She went on to say that she was helped greatly by doing a lot of self-care and reading books about 'spirituality' and 'enlightenment', while she tried to look at her tragedy as part of 'life's plan'.

Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.   

'I was caring for her for so many years, about seven years,' explained the social media star.  

Demi then went into detail about the impact the death of her parents had on her and how she aims to help others experiencing the same thing.

She explained: 'Then my dad passed away with cancer and then my mum then sadly passed away seven months after him with a stomach infection, and it just made me grow up really fast and be really really strong about things.
