Actress Sienna Miller is living the single life again, after splitting with her fiance Lucas Zwirner.

Miller, 38, and Zwirner, 29, the son of art dealer David Zwirner, were engaged back in January after a year of dating, but Page Six reports they have split.

The report claims that it was Miller who broke it off with Zwirner, though no reason for the break-up was given.

Reps for both Miller and Zwirner's art gallery he runs in New York City did not respond to requests for comment.

Miller and Zwirner had reportedly been dating for over a year when Zwirner popped the question back in January.

The couple were spotted at the Sundance Film Festival in January for the premiere of Miller's film Wander Darkly, where the actress was seen sporting what was believed to be an engagement ring.

Still, while Miller was spotted with the ring elsewhere, neither she nor Zwirner confirmed the engagement publicly.

Miller was spotted in paparazzi photos seen wearing the ring as recently as July, and they were spotted that month running errands together.

Sources also claimed that Miller and Zwirner had hit a 'rough patch' in their relationship just before Zwirner proposed in January.

Last year they were photographed at a pre-Met Gala dinner party in May, one of many New York City functions they were spotted together at.

They also arrived together at the New York premiere of Miller's film 21 Bridges, where she co-starred alongside Chadwick Boseman, who passed away at age 43 last week.

The couple were also spotted at Elle Goulding's wedding and, more recently, at the Writers Guild Awards in February.

Miller was previously engaged to her Alfie co-star Jude Law, who were in an on and off relationship until they split for good in 2011.

She also dated actor Tom Sturridge from 2011 until 2015, and the pair share eight-year-old daughter Marlowe Ottoline Layng Sturridge.

A source added that, if Miller and Zwirner were done for good, Miller would have no trouble moving on, with the source adding, 'She is awesome.'
