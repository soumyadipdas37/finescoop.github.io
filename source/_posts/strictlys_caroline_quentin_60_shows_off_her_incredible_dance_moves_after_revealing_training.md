The Men Behaving Badly star, 60, displayed her incredible moves in 1983 TV film Bouncing Back, but revealed she quit dancing after finding it 'tiring.'

Caroline told The Mirror last year she was a 'precociously good dancer' after receiving professional training for several years.

She said: 'The school I went to, it was a bit like the Royal Ballet school. I wasn't sent because I was going to meet the right people, I was there to learn to dance, which is really painful and tiring.'

'If you're thinking about it by all means consider it but I'm telling you know, it's exhausting.

'People think you arrive in a sitcom and don't realise 10-12 years before that you were dorrising around in a set of feathers on the end of a pier.'

Caroline performed in the original cast Les Miserables along with several small-time shows before landing her big break as Dorothy in Men Behaving Badly.

Among her early roles were Bouncing Back, which told the story of an experimental life coach attempts to treat depressed patients with chat-show therapy.

Caroline admitted she chose to give up dancing as she found the training too exhausting.

Caroline is set to join this year's Strictly lineup alongside Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing, The Wanted singer Max George and EastEnders star Maisie Smith.

Speaking about her involvement on The One Show, Caroline explained that she used to do ballet as a girl, as well as tap and modern dance, but is worried her knees will let her down.

'I've been keeping it very quiet and it's really difficult as I like a chat, as you well know, and it's been so hard to be quiet about it. I'm a bit scared, but quite excited.'

She added: 'I do remember some of what I learned [dancing] but my knees are 50 years older than the last time I attempted any of it, and it’s my knees and my undergarments that are troubling me most as a notion.

'I hope my knees don’t let me down and I hope the foundation garments live up to expectations when I start leaping about!'
