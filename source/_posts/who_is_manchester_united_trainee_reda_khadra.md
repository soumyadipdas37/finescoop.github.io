Khadra played 69 youth team games for Dortmund, scoring two goals and providing 11 assists 

Coincidentally, Khadra plays in the same position as £108-million-rated United target Jadon Sancho.

Khadra is a right winger at heart but versatility allows him to perform as a left winger or attacking midfielder.

The 19-year-old has frequently adopted the number seven shirt for Germany U18’s after being handed his debut in 2018.

As it stands, the Red Devils have not handed out the infamous number seven shirt - which has been worn by the likes of David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Since Ronaldo left Manchester United for Real Madrid in 2009, five players have worn the number seven jersey, only for all of them to flop at Old Trafford.

The German winger will be hoping to get his hands on the shirt in the future and add the history of number at Old Trafford. 

 Khadra won the U17 Bundesliga and the U19 Bundesliga and has represented Germany U18s

Coincidentally, Khadra plays in the same position as the other United target, Jadon Sancho

Khadra started his career at Tennis Borussia Berlin Youth, before quickly moving into the Borussia Dortmund youth set up.

He played 69 youth team matches for Dortmund in total, scoring two goals and providing 11 assists and scored in a UEFA Youth League clash against Derby County earlier this year.

Khadra is no stranger to competitive fixtures having won both the U17-Bundesliga West and the U19-Bundesliga West, as well as competing in the Regionalliga West, UEFA Youth League and DFB-Pokal der Junioren.

Khadra played a total of 11 times – clocking up 407 minutes - under the tutelage of Sebastian Geppert to claim the U17-Bundesliga title.

The youngster went on to establish himself one of Mike Tullberg’s mainstays in Dortmund’s U19 title win, playing 39 times and scoring six goals. 

After setting the youth system alight, Khadra tried his chance in the major leagues by training with Stoke City.

Nothing came of the experience, with Khadra returning to Dortmund before leaving again this summer.

As it stands, the 19-year-old is currently out of contract and is looking for a new club.
