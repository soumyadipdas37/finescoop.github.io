Bachelorette Georgia Love, 31, was forced to cancel her lavish Italian wedding. 

And now, the former TV star has spoken about being forced to delay her more recent Tasmanian wedding plans. 

Speaking to The Herald Sun this week, she said: 'We have set a (wedding) date next year and are forging ahead hoping it is going to happen as we want it to.' 

Delayed: 'We don't want to plan a third wedding' Bachelorette Georgia Love, 33, (pictured) has spoken about her postponed nuptials to fiancé Lee Elliott to the Herald Sun this week 

Georgia had originally planned on having her dream wedding with Lee in Italy, but the coronavirus pandemic forced the couple to cancel.

'We had planned an entire wedding for Italy and that has just gone completely out of the window,' she said. 

'We then planned a wedding for Tasmania and that date has now changed.' 

Troubles: 'We had planned an entire wedding for Italy and that has just gone completely out of the window,' she said. 'We then planned a wedding for Tasmania and that date has now changed.'

Georgia explained the pair don't want to plan a third wedding if they have to change their latest plans due to the pandemic. 

'We don't want to have to plan a third wedding, but if it ends up that we have to postpone it we will do that.' 

Despite the wedding plans being in disarray, Georgia has launched a new sleepwear range called Georgia Elliott. 

Plan B! Georgia (pictured) and Lee moved their wedding from Italy to Tasmania due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia announced in June 

The brand's first launch is flight themed. A reminder for buyers of what it is like to travel first class. 

Georgia and Lee got engaged last year. In June, Georgia told the Ben Rob & Robbo revealed the pair had changed the location to Tasmania due to COVID-19.   

'We were planning on a wedding for Italy next year so in 2021,' she said. 

Say 'I Do': The television presenter added that even if international travel opens the couple still plan to hold their nuptials in Georgia's home state of Tasmania instead

'But we've gone back on those plans, so we figured there's just too many 'what-ifs' in the world at the moment.'   

The television presenter added that even if international travel opens the couple still plan to hold their nuptials in Georgia's home state of Tasmania instead. 

'Even if Italy is fine by then we do not want to put it on our family and friends that they have to find the money to do so in such uncertain times with people losing their jobs,' she added. 

The perfect dress: After becoming engaged Georgia (pictured with Lee) admitted that she had already started trying on dresses before the pandemic hit

Speaking to Who Magazine in June, Georgia admitted that she had already started trying on dresses before the pandemic hit.   

'I'd started dress shopping. I was actually in a bridal boutique when my sister read out on her phone that Scott Morrison was holding a press conference announcing that all restaurants were shutting down,' she said. 

'I thought, 'Oh s**t.' And also, 'Um, can you concentrate on me in the beautiful white dress?''
