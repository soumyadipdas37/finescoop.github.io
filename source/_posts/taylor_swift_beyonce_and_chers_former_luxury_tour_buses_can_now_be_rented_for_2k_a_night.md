If you're on the lookout for the ultimate road trip vehicle, these swanky RVs might strike the right chord.

Hemphill Brothers, based in Tennessee, has started renting out their luxury tour buses used by the likes of Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Cher and Oprah to the public as a way of earning extra income as most gigs across the U.S are cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Photos reveal what the state-of-the-art buses look like inside, with luxury fixtures and fittings to keep their A-list clients happy. The coaches cost from $2,000 (£1,503) per day to hire with a driver and fuel included.

Hemphill Brothers has had a whole host of celebrity clients over the years including Taylor Swift (left) and Beyonce (right)

Joey and Trent Hemphill, who started the RV business 40 years ago and describe their RVs as 'rolling hotel suites', told MailOnline Travel that some of their clients 'rent them for years, some for months and some for just a few days' - depending on their travel needs.

All of their buses are decked out with 'top of the line materials such as genuine leather, hardwood flooring, granite, marble and quartz' and 'the combinations of these items produce a gorgeous bus interior'.

Some of the most luxurious perks in the custom-made vehicles include heated marble bathroom floors, electric window blinds and up to 14 TVs per coach to keep all passengers entertained.

And Hemphill Brothers also take requests for additional pieces of furniture or extra gizmos.

Some of the wackier requests they have received over the years include the installation of an upright piano for Harry Connick Jr. and a treadmill for Taylor Swift.

Business owner Joey added: 'We have also managed to create an indoor fireplace, tanning beds, a mobile museum complete with display cases, recording studios and numerous other outside of the box requests.

'Additionally, we have worked extensively with the U.S. Secret Service to provide vehicles for Presidential detail for more than a decade.

'You never know what the next person is going to ask for, but that is what makes building a bus so much fun. No two buses are alike and there is always going to be new challenges around the corner.'

The Hemphills started out with two RVs in their fleet and now they have 115.

Generally, their pop star clients book ten coaches per tour to accommodate all of the artists and production crew, while members of the public often book one for all the family.

Explaining how the coronavirus has impacted business, they revealed: 'This year was set to be a record year in Hemphill Brothers Coach Company's 40 years in the entertainer coach business.

Some of the most luxurious perks in the custom-made vehicles include heated marble bathroom floors, electric window blinds and around 14 TVs per coach to keep all passengers entertained

The Hemphills say that generally, their celebrity clients book 10 coaches per tour to accommodate all of the artists and production crew, while members of the public often book one for all the family

'In March, when Covid-19 hit, all our 115 custom coaches came home due to concerts being abruptly cancelled.

'With the current travel conditions and the fact that artists are still not performing on stages for concerts, Hemphill Brothers had a unique opportunity to offer our custom-built luxury coaches and drivers to the public for travel. This is something we have never done before.

'It seems, more than ever, families are seeing our country this summer for vacation and our buses can conveniently transport you from point A to point B with your own schedule and itinerary.

'The coaches are equipped with lots of storage underneath and can also pull a trailer or car hauler if needed.

'Travellers can bring their bicycles, sand chairs, golf carts, golf clubs, fishing poles and whatever else they might need to enjoy their vacation and have fun.

'The coaches are truly someone’s home away from home.'
