Kate Hudson has vowed to never give up her film career, but concedes the mainstream industry is a harsh environment for any successful actress. 

The daughter of screen legend Goldie Hawn has juggled a hugely consistent Hollywood career while raising her three children, Ryder, 16, Bingham, nine and 23-month old Rani. 

And she insists she will continue to actively work despite the demands of the job sometimes keeping her away from her loved ones for extended periods of time. 

Opening up: Kate Hudson has vowed to never give up her film career, but concedes the mainstream industry is a harsh environment for any successful actress

Speaking to model Naomi Campbell during an appearance on her No Filter podcast, she said: 'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies.  

'The issue with movie making is that it takes you away, and it’s really really shi**y hours, and when you’re doing it it’s like "I better really really like this story. I better love the people I’m working with. "I better love this director," or it really is like why am I here?' 

The actress also reflected on perceived gender bias within the film industry, and insisted it is harder for women to find success because they are given fewer chances.

She said: 'One thing in Hollywood – women don’t get the same opportunities, and what I mean by that is one failure is like an equivalent to three failures for a guy. 

'One female box office not great opening for a woman… the next time they’re thinking of casting you for something they’ll be like, "her last movie didn’t do great."

'For a guy, they usually give them about three to five chances, right? And they’ll still get paid, and they’ll still get the opportunity but for some reason with women it’s a little bit different.'

All change: Kate admitted the film industry will never go back to how it used be when she made her first movies in the latest '90s

She added: 'The other thing is that when women get really famous, they don't really want the famous person in the movie, they want a new face, whereas for a'  guy it's totally different. I think it’s just a bad antiquated habit.'

Kate was speaking from home after spending the duration of lockdown in Colorado, where she grew up, with husband Danny Fujikawa and her extend family.

Looking to the future and her return to work beyond the pandemic, Kate admitted to feeling sad that the film industry will never go back to how it used be when she made her first movies in the latest '90s.  

'I’m a silver lining type person so I look at it as Hollywood the way it was is dead, it’s just over,' she said.

'And I feel so grateful that I had the opportunity to be in that... it’s almost like I was in the last class.'
