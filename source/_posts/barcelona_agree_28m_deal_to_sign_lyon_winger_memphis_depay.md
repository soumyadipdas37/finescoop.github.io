Barcelona have agreed a £28m deal to bring Lyon winger Memphis Depay to the Nou Camp.

Ronald Koeman has been keen on signing the 26-year-old, who he knows very well from his time coaching the Dutch national team.

Depay is set to travel to Barcelona in the coming days to complete a medical, and it is hoped he will be presented as a Blaugrana player later in the week.

It could mean that Depay might be available for Barcelona's opening game of the LaLiga season, which is on September 27 against Villarreal.

Koeman has only recently been appointed as manager of Barcelona replacing former coach Quique Setien.

The club are hoping to bounce back strong after a disastrous season where they lost the LaLiga title to their great rivals Real Madrid, and were humiliated in their Champions League exit following an 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich.

Depay joined Lyon in January 2017 after a disastrous spell at Manchester United who he joined in the summer of 2015 for £25m. 

Manchester United had buy-back and sell-on clauses included in the deal when Depay joined the French side for around £17m.

Since joining Lyon, Depay has shown much more maturity and has improved from his days at Old Trafford, scoring 57 goals in 140 appearances.

Depay made a fantastic start to the new season for Lyon scoring a hat-trick in their opening day 4-1 victory over Dijon. 

The Dutchman could start in an attacking lineup with Lionel Messi who decided to stay at the Nou Camp, after previously insisting he was going to leave.
