'Well we’re gonna have to go for a 12 by 12.'

Abbey said that she has loved her time at home with her children.

She explained: 'I've really enjoyed the lockdown. It's such a special thing to pause life and have your husband and your kids with you every single day. We're all so busy running around like headless chickens usually so I've been quite grateful for that.

'There's been times where we've been exhausted and the kids are driving us mad but ultimately I've loved it. My kids are up at quarter to six and by the time they're all in bed it's eight so we literally have one hour together before I'm snoring my head off.'
