Federal prosecutors have hit Lev Parnas with fresh charges, accusing him of defrauding investors in a startup company called 'Fraud Guarantee.'

The charge was announced on Friday by Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a superseding indictment that also levies new charges against Parnas' associate David Correia. 

Parnas, along with his associate Igor Fruman, were originally charged in October of 2019 with planning to direct funds from foreign nationals to U.S. politicians while trying to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations, prosecutors said.

Parnas and Fruman famously assisted Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, in his freelance investigation into allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine when he was vice president.

The new charges stem from Parnas' startup, Fraud Guarantee, a nebulous entity incorporated in Florida, which was dissolved by state officials in 2014 after failing to file an annual report.

Fraud Guarantee promised to offer an insurance product that would allow policyholders to recoup their losses in the event they lost money due to fraudulent conduct, but the company never got a product to market.

In the superseding indictment unsealed on Friday, prosecutors say that Parnas and Correia lied to at least seven investors, telling them their investments would be used to build the business, but instead siphoning off cash for personal expenses.

Prosecutors say those personal expenses included hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent for Parnas’ personal residence and tens of thousands of dollars at luxury car leasing companies. 

The investments involved in the scam totaled more than $2 million, according to the indictment.
