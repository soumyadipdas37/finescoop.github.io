Tony Mokbel is set to launch a bid for freedom after serving just 13 years of his 30-year sentence for drug trafficking, a court has heard.

The Melbourne gangland kingpin, who was depicted on the television series Underbelly, is appealing his conviction over the Lawyer X scandal which recently rocked the Victorian legal system.

The 55-year-old, who narrowly survived a prison stabbing last year, is one of several convicted gangsters looking to get their sentences overturned after is was revealed police used criminal defence barrister Nicola Gobbo as an informant.

Mokbel and his new legal counsel fronted the Court of Appeal on Wednesday hoping to get the process started.

Ms Gobbo had represented Mokbel on three major criminal trials while acting as a confidential police informant.  

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews called a Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants in 2018, with the complete findings to be handed down in November this year.  

The inquiry have already stated that Ms Gobbo's conduct may constitute a breach of her duty to the administration of justice, the court and her client. 

'We have been seeking disclosure for many years and we have finally got to a point where we believe we have enough to proceed to an appeal,' barrister Richard Maidment QC told the directions hearing, the Herald Sun reported.

'Through the lense of Mr Mokbel, he has been seeking disclosure for a very long time.

'He is very anxious now to proceed as quickly as possible to a hearing.'

But Registrar Ian Irving ruled in favour of a request by state and federal prosecutors asking for more time to dissect the 14,000 pages of material involved in the case.

A two-month extension was granted and proceedings will get underway on November 25.

The bid for freedom comes after Mokbel almost died after a jail yard stabbing at Victoria's Barwon Prison in February 2019. 

Mokbel was stabbed seven times by two men with cutlery and sharpened wires who kicked him in the head, knocking out his teeth.   

As the assault attracted attention from other inmates and prison guards, the men could be heard screaming: 'You're not an enforcer, this is what you get for talking to the screws you f**king dog.' 

So violent was the attack, a court refused to release footage of it to the media.

Teira Bennett and Eldea Teuira were sentenced to seven years each for the heinous attack.
