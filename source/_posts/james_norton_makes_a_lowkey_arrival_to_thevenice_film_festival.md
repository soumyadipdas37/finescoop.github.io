James, who recently starred in the BBC drama The Trial Of Christine Keeler, has been hotly-tipped as the latest actor to play James Bond.

The Sun claimed bookmaker Ladbrokes has suspended betting on the star being the next man to portray the fictional secret agent.

Amid frenzied speculation about who will be the next to play Bond, with stars including Richard Madden and Idris Elba being linked with the role, a source told the publication both sides were trying 'to get a deal signed off'.

The insider said: 'Numerous meetings and secret squirrel script readings were had at the back end of last year.

'Producers wanted a Brit and James ticks all the boxes - tall, strapping, physically fit and, of course, looks great in a dinner jacket.

'Everyone is hoping to get the deal confirmed and signed off, with an announcement in the summer.'

The hunt for a new Bond began in 2016 when Daniel, 51, admitted he was 'over it' after being cast in the role since Casino Royale in 2006.

'I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists,' he told Time Out when asked whether he would do another Bond film.

'No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.' 

The latest film in the Bond franchise - No Time To Die - stars Daniel in his final outing as the spy and is set to be released later this year after coronavirus delayed the April premiere.

James, meanwhile plays the titular character Gareth Jones in his drama film Mr. Jones, which was released on February 7.

The movie tells the true story of a Welsh journalist who travelled to the Soviet Union in 1933 and uncovers some unpleasant truths about an international conspiracy.

James also starred in Little Women, alongside the likes of Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, and Meryl Streep earlier this year.
