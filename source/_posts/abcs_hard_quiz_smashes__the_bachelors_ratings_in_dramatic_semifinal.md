Despite the glitz, glamour and one 'extreme feminist hippie' requesting Locky Gilbert to provide a sperm sample, The Bachelor's semi-finale ratings were not so eventful.

Channel Ten's hit reality dating show - currently in its eighth season - was the fourth most viewed program across the country for the 7pm timeslot on Wednesday.

The Bachelor came just shy of ABC's 7.30 with 584,000 viewers, despite a dramatic encounter between Locky and contestant Izzy Sharman-Firth's mum, Christina, who requested 'as a consolation prize, (you could supply) just a bit of sperm?'

It also came notwithstanding speculation of having a reverse Honey Badger-style ending.

Instead of rejecting the final two contestants as Nick Cummins did on The Bachelor in 2018, theories are flying he is 'in love with more than one girl' and has difficulty choosing a winner.

Ratings for The Bachelor on Wednesday also fell short of ABC's 7:30, which raked in 637,000 viewers for the hour.

The Block, which was well into the bedroom-bathroom builds ahead of Sunday’s reveal, scored second place, with 701,000 viewers - down from 742,000 the week before.

Tom Gleeson's Hard Quiz on ABC reigned in at first by scoring the top entertainment drawcard at 729,000 viewers after 693,000 a week ago.

The Bachelors deflated stance on Wednesday, however, beat Seven's Highway Patrol.  

It received 412,000 and 369,000 viewers for the hour. 

The penultimate episode of the COVID-19 pandemic-interrupted season was number one under 50 on Wednesday, according to Media Week.

Its ratings for the semi-finale fell short of drawing in 618,000 a week ago, and plummeted compared to the second last episode of The Bachelor in 2019, which had an audience of 761,000. 

 The much-anticipated finale of The Bachelor on Thursday will see Locky choose the woman he loves most - between Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis.

It follows Locky shutting down rumours he was no longer dating the winner on Monday, telling New Idea he was '110,000 per cent in love' with his chosen contestant. 

'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to reveal his girlfriend.

'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.'
