Taraji P. Henson celebrated turning 50 while showing that she should still leave jaws on the floor with her outstanding physique.

The Empire star showed off her stunning bikini body on Friday, September 11, in a series of revealing Instagram photos.

The day before, she was celebrating her birthday in style with hanging out on a boat with some of her best lady friends on a boat, including singer Mary J. Blige and radio star Angie Martinez.

Taraji opted for a simple white bikini, but there wasn't anything conservative about the skimpy suit that barely covered her.

The halter top feature slim triangular cups and a tiny matching bottom half that rode up above her hips.

The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button actress seemed to be putting on a show for her pals, who could be seen facing her and pumping their fists at the bottom of the photos.

She spiced up her beach-ready look by wearing a thick head of black and red braids, which rested messily over her shoulders, and she blocked out the sun with striped cat-eye sunglasses.

Earlier on Friday, she shared some intimate looks at the girls trip, including a clsoeup of her towering hair, zebra-stripe sunglasses and her silver mask.

Although she practiced coronavirus safety measures on the dock, she and her friends appeared to take the masks off once they were on board.

Another short clip showed everyone dancing along to Saweetie's Tap In, and as they departed the boat she caught a sweet sea lion taking a gander at the revelers.

Back at it: It was reported in July that Taraji will reprise her role as Cookie Lyon in an Empire spinoff as part of a new two-year first-look deal with 20th Century Fox TV; shown in March

Back in July, Taraji moved to give her fans more Empire content by signing on to an untitled Empire spin-off featuring her fan-favorite character Cookie Lyon.

The project is part of a two-year first-look deal she signed with 20th Century Fox Television, which will give the network the first pick at any projects she develops.

Sources familiar with the new project said it could bring closure to Empire, which ended for good two episodes shy of its intended series finale after production was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The new show will follow Cookie as she relocates to Los Angeles, and it may feature appearances by some of her children.
