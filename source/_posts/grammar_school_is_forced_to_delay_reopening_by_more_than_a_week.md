A school has delayed its reopening by more than a week following a flurry of coronavirus cases linked to holidays abroad.

Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was set to welcome back pupils today but will now return on September 10.

Following talks with health officials, headteacher Kay Mountfield decided to squeeze the brakes and broke the news to parents last Friday.

She cited Covid-19 infections 'in the school community' and insisted she was 'prioritising safety'.

It is a further blow to the school which was left bruised by the A-Level exams fiasco when 85 per cent of its pupils had marks downgraded.

In a newsletter to parents seen by the Maidenhead Advertiser, Ms Mountfield wrote: 'In the last 24 hours, the school has been informed of a number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the school community following travels overseas.'

Her decision to push the reopening back has been supported by Public Health England, Buckinghamshire Council and the Department for Education. 

'All the organisations, along with our Chair of Governors, support my decision to prioritise safety and delay the opening until Thursday, September 10,' she added. 

Ms Mountfield further stressed the need for pupils and parents to observe robust social distancing



This was echoed by the local council, which revealed there had been a cluster of positive tests from young people in the area. 

Buckinghamshire Council tweeted: 'There are some linked cases of coronavirus amongst a group of young people & their families in the Marlow area. 

'All households are isolating, no cause for wider alarm but pls stay vigilant.

'Self-isolate straight away if you get symptoms and follow NHS advice.' 

Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are going back to classes this week after almost six months out of school.
