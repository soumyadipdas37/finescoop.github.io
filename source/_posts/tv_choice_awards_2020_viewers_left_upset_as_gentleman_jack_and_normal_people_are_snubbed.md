TV Choice Awards 2020 viewers were left upset after Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones were snubbed, while Gentleman Jack and Normal People lost out on winning Best Drama to White House Farm at this year's virtual event.

Normal People's Paul Mescal was beaten by Doc Martin's leading man Martin Clunes, who scooped the Best Actor award, and his on-screen partner Daisy Edgar-Jones lost out to Killing Eve star Jodie Comer in the Best Actress category. 

Best New Drama was awarded to White House Farm, a surprise victory over nominees Normal People, Gentleman Jack and Gangs Of London.

Although overall viewers were delighted, some took to Twitter to vent their frustration that BBC drama Normal People, and its stars were snubbed, as well as Gentleman Jack failing to win an award.  

'Well don’t fully agree with those @TVChoiceAwards disappointed for @mescal_paul @DaisyEdgarJones and all the #NormalPeople team that they didn’t win #tvchoiceawards always winners to us!!' tweeted one fan.

'Oh, I really wanted #NormalPeople to win something at the #tvchoiceawards, I really liked the show and the acting: is very real and raw (and I will read the book as soon as I can go to the library).

'But I'm glad they were nominated! @NormalPeopleBBC @mescal_paul @DaisyEdgarJones,' added another.

'It's a real shame that Gentleman Jack hasn't won Best New Drama (I mean really?!) but congratulations to Jodie Comer and Peaky Blinders. #jodiecomer #PeakyBlinders #gentlemanjack #tvchoiceawards. Once again gentleman jack has been robbed!'   

Normal People series had been adapted from Sally Rooney's book of the same name and tells the story of two teenagers in love from two different walks of life. 

Irish actor Paul, 24, plays Connell in the BBC drama which explores the intricacies of his romance with Marianne - portrayed by Daisy, 22.  

BBC series Gentleman Jack, meanwhile, follows the romance between landowner Anne (Suranne Jones) and heiress Ann (Sophie Rundle) who are believed to have met in 1832, in a time when homosexuality was both a crime and a taboo. 









'They were robbed!' Although overall viewers were delighted, some took to Twitter to vent their frustration

Accepting yet another prize, award-winning thespian Jodie, 27, said: 'I just wanted to pop in and say a huge thank you to everybody who voted for me this year. 

'Thank you! Your continued support means so much, and I want you all to know that it doesn't go unnoticed.

'I hope that we can bring you the season four you deserve sooner rather than later, but it will be worth the wait. In the meantime take care and thank you very much.' 

Killing Eve has already been renewed for its fourth series, though it remains to be seen when filming will begin due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Best Actor recipient Martin, 58, added: 'Thank you so so much for this amazing award. I'm so glad that you still like this show after nine series!

'You obviously like it enough to vote for me because there was some classy competition this year in the actors category. We're blown away. It's a family business and we love making it, down in Cornwall.

'There are so many people to thank, so many writers, such an amazing cast. But the most important person is my amazing wife who has produced every single script of nine series.

'And I am allowed to tell you there will be a tenth series. We are going to make that next year, Covid or not!'

Just hours earlier, ITV announced series 10 of medical comedy-drama Doc Martin will be its last after 17 years on screen. 

In a video message on behalf of White House Farm, actor Freddie Fox said: 'It's a delightful affirmation of the work done on the show, especially given the amazing competition.' 

The crime drama series is based on the real-life events that took place in August 1985. Jeremy Bamber, played by Freddie, is serving life in prison after being found guilty of murdering his adoptive parents, sister and two nephews. 

The virtual ceremony was hosted by Greatest Hits Radio's Simon Mayo, after the usual red carpet was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
