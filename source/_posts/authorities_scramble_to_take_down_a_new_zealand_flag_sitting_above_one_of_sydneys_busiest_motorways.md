Government officials have rushed to replace a New Zealand flag displayed above a bridge after a driver noticed a mistake with its design.

Motorists on Sydney's Anzac Bridge spotted the flag with a unique design pattern displayed on top of one of the two towers above the motorway.

Both the Australian and New Zealand flags are flown atop the bridge and both show the Southern Cross and Union Jack.

But in the version seen above the bridge, the New Zealand flag's Southern Cross pattern is wrong.

The final red star that normally appears at the bottom of the Southern Cross is seen below the Union Jack.

The wrong flag has been flying above the bridge for more than a month. 

New Zealand Flag Association President John Moody was unimpressed.

'I think New Zealanders would feel a certain disrespect,' he told 7News.

Mr Moody was unsure as to why the wrong flag had been put up. 

'It could be laziness, ignorance... it may have been somebody who thought somehow the New Zealand flag was similar to the Australian flag,' he said.

A Transport for NSW spokesperson said the wrong flag had been changed. 

'Transport for NSW was made aware of an incorrect New Zealand flag flying on the ANZAC Bridge and replaced it overnight,' they said.

'The issue arose due to a manufacturing fault by the supplier.'
