Ben Stiller is virtually bringing his costars from Night at the Museum back together for a good cause. 

The stars of the beloved 2006 fantastical family comedy are set to reunite for the 200th episode of the Stars in the House webseries on Thursday.

The virtual get together comes 14 years after the first film in the franchise debuted in theaters, seeing Stiller as the night guard on duty at the American Museum of Natural History when an ancient spell causes the museum to come to life.

Epic! Ben Stiller is virtually bringing his costars from Night at the Museum back together for the 200th episode of the Stars in the House webseries on Thursday

Joining Ben for the special event will be other big names from the original film, Owen Wilson [Jedediah], Carla Gugino [Rebecca Hutman], Hank Azaria [Kahmunrah] and Steve Coogan [Octavius]. 

The Night at the Museum reunion marks a big milestone for the Stars in the House webseries which was launched in March during the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The virtual events are hosted by SiriusXM Broadway host Seth Rudetsky and producer James Wesley and benefit The Actors Fund, which has been providing services and support to the entertainment industry during the crisis. 

Previously, Stars in the House has brought back together the casts from shows like The Good Place, Glee and Melrose Place.

It's been too long: Joining Ben for the special event will be other big names from the original film, Owen Wilson [Jedediah], Carla Gugino [Rebecca Hutman], Hank Azaria [Kahmunrah] and Steve Coogan [Octavius]

This particular episode will also be done in conjunction with the Poll Hero Project, an initiative to recruit young people to be paid poll workers for the 2020 Presidential Election in November.

Typically, poll workers tend to be elderly retirees but in light of that group being high risk in the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a push to register younger people in their place. 

While the reunion is very exciting for fans of the film, the absence of star Robin Williams will be hard to miss.

The comedian portrayed President Theodore Roosevelt in the franchise and tragically died by suicide in August of 2014, just three months after the third installment wrapped up filming.
