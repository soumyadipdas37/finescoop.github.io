Simon Cowell has admitted he thought 'for a moment' that Britain's Got Talent 2020 would have to be scrapped altogether when COVID-19 put the breaks on the current series.

The talent show has been mired by issues this year - namely the coroanvirus outbreak bringing the annual competition to a standstill, as well as Simon's recent bike accident which saw him forced to sit out the resumed series.

But Simon, 60, has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.

Close call: Simon Cowell has admitted he thought 'for a moment' that Britain's Got Talent 2020 would have to be scrapped altogether when COVID-19 put the breaks on the current series

Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, "Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"

'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.'

The semi-finals will be pre-recorded as opposed to airing live on ITV. There won't be a physical audience, but Simon has teased that the audience will still feature from home.

'I don’t want to give too much away but when you watch the semi-finals and final you’re going to see something you’ve never seen before, it’s very high tech. It’s been very stimulating putting the whole thing together,' he said.

Simon also admitted he felt sad that, when the last audition episode was broadcast in the spring, it was uncertain whether the series would return this year or not.

'It was sad when we had to put the last audition show out not knowing if we would definitely get to do the remaining semi-final shows,' he reflected. 'But we are all really excited to complete the series and celebrate our BGT winner!'

Simon went on to tease that the judging desk will look different thanks to social distancing - but it's been presumed that he won't feature on it at all, with his accident forcing him to recruit a replacement: former BGT winner Ashley Banjo.

'I think we’re going to have the longest judges’ desk in the world to make sure everyone has lots of space!' Simon said. 'That’s the plus side to come out of all this, that David [Walliams] has to stay far away from me for the foreseeable future!'

He added: 'That’s the plus side to come out of all this, that David [Walliams] has to stay far away from me for the foreseeable future!'

Ashley will sit in Simon's seat for now, but it's suggested he'll only be required for the initial semi-final shows - and that Simon could be back for the grand finale in October.

Of recruiting Ashley, Simon said: 'Ashley will be a fantastic addition to the panel. He knows the power of the show; and the responsibility of it.

'I couldn’t think of a better person to sit in my seat whilst I follow doctor’s orders. I hate that stupid bike!'

Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month. But he remains positive, praising his BGT team.

'The safety of everyone is more important. We’re going to have to rehearse acts in a completely different way. But everyone’s been up for it, the contestants, the crew and the whole team, it’s been amazing to see everyone come together and work so hard to get Britain’s Got Talent back on air.'

Ashley said of his new role: 'As if 2020 couldn’t get any crazier! It’s super humbling and super exciting!

'I remember being on that stage last year and talking about how it’s been ten years since we won, and how people should never tell you, you can’t do something.

'Walking on that stage as a 20-year-old street dancer from the streets of East London and now I am walking out there and stepping in for the big man! It feels really nice, almost poetic.'

Ashley and his dance troupe Diversity famously beat off favourite Susan Boyle to win Britain’s Got Talent in 2009 in front of a TV audience of more than 20 million people. 

Since then, Ashley’s career has gone from strength to strength - both performing and choreographing Diversity around the world and selling out nine UK tours, selling over 800,00 tickets in the process, as well as appearing as a judge on Got To Dance (Sky1), Dance, Dance, Dance (ITV) and Dancing On Ice (ITV) and presenting both Can’t Touch This (BBC) and Flirty Dancing (Channel 4).

The semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.

As usual, Ant and Dec will host the semi-finals whilst Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams will join Ashley at the judges’ desk.

Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.

With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.

The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.
