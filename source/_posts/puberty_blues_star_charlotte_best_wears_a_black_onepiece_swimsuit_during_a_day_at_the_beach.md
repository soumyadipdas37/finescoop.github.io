Charlotte Best made the most of the warming weather during a day at the beach in Sydney's Clovelly on Wednesday.

The 26-year-old actress showed off her stunning curves in a black one-shoulder one-piece swimsuit.

The stylish swimsuit featured ties on one side of the bodice and on the shoulder to create a ruching effect.

Charlotte initially wore her long brunette hair loose, but later tied it up in a high ponytail to keep it dry when she took to the water.

She accessorised with a series of fine jewellery pieces, including rings, a bracelet and earrings, and appeared makeup-free on the outing. 

The former Home and Away actress was accompanied by a male friend, with the two seen chatting as they stood near the water together.

Charlotte previously dated MasterChef judge Andy Allen from 2013 until 2016.

Her forgotten romance with Andy, 32, was revealed in a recently unearthed interview they gave to ELLE Australia in October 2015. 

Speaking to the publication, the then-couple revealed they had been introduced through a mutual friend, who had worked as a crew member on both Home and Away and MasterChef.

After laying out her belongings on the concrete pavement, a smiling Charlotte pulled out a few yoga moves, stretching as she laid on her stomach.

Extending her arms in front of her, Charlotte curled up in an 'extended child's pose', her black sandals kicked off beside her white beach towel.  

Despite being at the beach, the Tidelands actress had a knit jumper on hand in case the weather turned.

In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald in December 2018, Charlotte revealed she was a tomboy as a child.

She said she tried her hand at a variety of different sports while growing up, even though she was 'not that co-ordinated'.

'I was never any good at much of it. I was very competitive, so I was the captain of lots of different things for two seconds. But when I got bored, I'd move on to the next thing,' she laughed.
