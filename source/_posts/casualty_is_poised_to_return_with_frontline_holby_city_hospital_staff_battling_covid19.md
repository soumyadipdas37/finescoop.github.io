Casualty is poised to return with the most powerful episode in its 35-year history detailing the current coronavirus health crisis and its devastating impact on hospitals across the United Kingdom. 

The long-running BBC show has tentatively resumed filming after the highly infectious virus, which has claimed the lives of more than 41,000 British citizens, abruptly ground production all TV and film projects to a halt.

And viewers will see its much loved cast members tirelessly work on the NHS frontline as Holby City Hospital reels from the effects of COVID-19. 

Welcome back: Casualty is poised to return with the most powerful episode in its 35-year history detailing the current coronavirus health crisis

Clinical Lead Connie Beauchamp, played by Amanda Mealing, will find herself confronted with the biggest test of her professional career after several team members are stricken with the potentially fatal virus. 

As the hospital faces insurmountable odds in their fight against the coronavirus, Connie also faces a difficult personal challenge after lover Jacob played by Charles Venn, also tests positive for COVID-19.

Fortunately, she will have the unwavering support of Casualty staple Charlie Fairhead, the show's longest serving character, played by Derek Thompson.

With Charlie devastated by the impact of COVID-19 on care homes and their vulnerable elderly residents, the pair are forced to make their most gut-wrenching decision ever.  

The pandemic also prompts paramedic Lev, played by Uriel Emil, to move out of the family home during lockown in a desperate bid to protect his young son, who is recovering from cancer. 

The decision adds a new complication to Lev's fraught 16-year marriage, with wife Faith, played by Kirsty Mitchell, still coming to terms with claims that her husband has had an illicit affair?
