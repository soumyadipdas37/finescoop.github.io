A woman has lost her job as a childcare educator after she was caught selling MDMA pills to a network of customers. 

Rhianna Dorothy Dooley, 21, pleaded guilty to numerous drug offences stemming from a narcotics business operating out of her Queensland share house, with her boyfriend also being charged. 

The Townsville Supreme Court heard Dooley sold as many as 50 pills at a time to her clients. 

Her barrister Mark McCarthy told the court that his client was a 'passionate' childcare worker before her arrest, according to The Townsville Bulletin.

Ms Dooley's boyfriend Dean Shaw (pictured left) was also charged after police busted the drug trafficking business and was sentenced on September 2 

She has since lost her 'Blue Card' over the drug trafficking charges - meaning she can she is longer allowed to work with children.  

Video evidence played to the court showed Ms Dooley packaging the powdered drug into capsules with her boyfriend Dean Robert Shaw, who has also been charged with multiple drug offences. 

Ms Dooley was an 'enthusiastic' member of the significant trafficking operation, the prosecutor told the court. 

The then 20-year-old was not a focus of the police investigation into the business they alleged had been running from November 11 to December 31 2018. 

However, after officers raided the couple's house in Townsville's west on December 31 last year, she admitted her involvement and gave police her phone. 

Ms Dooley had used encrypted apps to market the narcotics - selling up to 50 capsules per transaction at a price of $25 each.

After the raid she was charged with one count of trafficking drugs, nine counts of supplying drugs and possessing something used in the commission of a crime. 

Ms Dooley received a three year sentence for the trafficking charge and smaller concurrent sentences for the other charges. 

She was immediately released on parole, but will now have a criminal record. 

Shaw received the same sentence for a string of charges including trafficking on September 2 and also had convictions recorded.
