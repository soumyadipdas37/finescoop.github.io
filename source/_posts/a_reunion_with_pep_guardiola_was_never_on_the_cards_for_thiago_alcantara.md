New Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara was never planning on reuniting with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.

The Spanish coach brought Thiago to Bayern Munich from Barcelona in 2013 after working together at the La Liga club.

But according to the Athletic a reunion in the Premier League was 'never on the cards'.

The Spain international won three Bundesliga titles with Guardiola whilst in Germany

'They had a good professional relationship but as with many players under Pep's management, the experience together was too intense. 

'Very, very few go running back to him,' one source close to the player and to Barcelona explains. 

The Spain international won three Bundesliga titles with Guardiola but never lifted the Champions League whilst in Germany together. 

Instead Liverpool confirmed the signing of Thiago from Bayern Munich for £25million.

It was announced on Thursday that the Premier League champions had finalised negotiations with the German giants after a summer of speculation linking Thiago to Anfield and now they have sealed the deal. 

The Spain international told Liverpool's official website: 'I think it’s an amazing feeling. I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here.

'When the years are passing, you are trying to win as much as you can – and when you win, you want to win more. I think this club describes what I am as well; I want to achieve all of the goals, win as many trophies as possible.

'It also [has] this kind of family [feeling] that I need because we [like to] have a very close relationship with the club and I think I will feel this, I will have this feeling, with this club as well.'

He has now been announced as a Liverpool player by the club after completing a medical and agreeing personal terms.
