Big Brother star Kieran Davidson won more than $15,000 during his time on the rebooted reality show. 

And now the 21-year-old reality star has revealed the surprising way he blew all of the prize money.  

Kieran said he purchased camera equipment for his career as a vlogger.

'I purchased a brand new camera rig, drone and heaps of other equipment because I'm a videographer and need the equipment,' he told The Wash.

Kieran famously won $15,344 from the winner's prize fund during a stand-off in the White Room with fellow evictee Sophie in an episode aired in July.

Host Sonia Kruger tempted both Kieran and Sophie Budack with a rising money counter, and said whoever pressed the buzzer could leave the competition with that amount.

'I just won $15,000 of the grand prize total and I couldn't be happier!' Kieran said after pressing the red button just before the timer ran out.

'You thought you could get rid of me at the first eviction, and you failed! Then you failed another six times, and now I'm leaving on my own terms,' he said.

'And I've just stolen $15,000,' he finished.  

While speaking to Daily Mail Australia soon after the episode, Keiran said he lost touch with reality while in the room.       

The secret room and its contents were entirely white, and there were no windows or outside stimuli, which made for a truly maddening combination.

'Big Brother said he had been asked to check on me to see if I was feeling alright, and I told him I was fine exercising,' Kieran explained.

'I said, 'Yeah I've been exercising for about a half hour', and he goes, 'Kieran, you've been doing Soobong's exercise for two hours and 45 minutes.' I'd been walking on the spot for almost three hours! I was going mental.'

On another occasion, Keiran said he performed an exercise routine with a chair placed over his back, which he thought took 10 minutes, but actually went on for two hours.
