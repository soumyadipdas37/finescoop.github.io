It is understandable that priorities have changed since the pandemic but a report suggests Britons now value a strong Wi-Fi connection over their parents.

Being happy and healthy still top the list of the things we rate most, but we also cannot go without Netflix, online shopping and social media.

According to a study, many of us also appreciate the simpilicity of a good cup of tea, and the joys of a good belly laugh, while the NHS, seaside jaunts, a garden and the family pet are also among the top things in life. 

The survey of 1,500 adults by Travelodge found that 62 per cent reported that they value having Wi-Fi at home.

The survey of 1,500 adults found that 62 per cent reported that they value having Wi-Fi at home so we can browse social media and watch shows on Netflix

Many also value their health and their apprecition of the NHS puts this at number three on the list of things we value most

A family pet is also key to happiness, while people also reported that a settled family and home life are among their top essentials

This is key to our enjoyment of our Netflix subscriptions, making video calls and browsing social media - all things we hold dear. 

Despite the unusual findings, the report revealed that we do value family and our homes among the top things in life. 

Eight in 10 of us prize a faithful partner and a settled domestic life, with well-behaved children and a garden are also among the top things Brits rate.  

Three-quarters also value their health, with pride in the NHS pushing the service to number three on the list. 

More than half of those who took part said holidays and short breaks were essential to get them through the year.

The study found almost half felt the country was more community minded and appreciated their neighbours more since the pandemic.
