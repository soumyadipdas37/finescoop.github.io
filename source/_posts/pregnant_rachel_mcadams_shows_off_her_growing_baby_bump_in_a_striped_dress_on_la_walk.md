A very pregnant Rachel McAdams was spotted out in Los Angeles on Friday looking nicely put together. 

The 41-year-old Canadian born actress wore a blue-and-white striped maternity dress with a fun hat.

And the Wedding Crashers star seemed to have her hands full as she carried several books while juggling two bags.

She paired the nautical sundress with a pair of white trainers with leopard back detailing and a navy tote, protecting her face from the sun in a straw hat with a silver ribbon around the band. 

Coordinating her mask with her ensemble, Rachel rocked a dark grey face covering and a pair of oversized sunglasses. 

Not seen was her boyfriend of four years, Jamie Linden with whom she already has a son.

Balancing act: The mother-to-be carried a very large to-go bag, while juggling her drinks and stylish purse as she tried to safely put all her belongings into her vehicle 

The Game Night actress made a few stops, picking up what appeared to be books and games for her son before driving to a trendy cafe to get coffee and takeout. 

She kept her blonde locks down as she walked with the breakfast provisions to her Tesla. 

McAdams' pregnancy was first reported in August after she was spotted out with a baby bump. 

The actress is so lowkey about her family that she has never even walked a red carpet with her screenwriter boyfriend Jamie who she has been dating since 2016.

Despite being a Hollywood actress in the public eye, McAdams is very protective when it comes to her personal life and does not have any social media.

Rachel quietly gave birth to her now two-year-old son - whose name has never been publicly released - in April 2018 and shares very little about him. 

She also skipped the premiere of her film Game Night.   

In an interview with the Sunday Times in 2018, she vowed 'I want to keep his life private, even if mine isn't'.

While in quarantine Rachel has been afforded a lot of time with both her boyfriend and her young son as they split time between her farm outside of Toronto and their home in Los Angeles. 

Speaking to Heroes of Health on the London Health Sciences Foundation Youtube, Rachel shared that she has a welcomed distraction with her two-year-old son even though some days are harder than others. 

'There are days, sure, but I would be so bored without him around to make it so fun,' she said adding that he is 'so entertaining.' 

Rachel also shared that thankfully none of her projects really took a hit, as she had just finished shooting Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, in Iceland before the pandemic hit. 

Fire Saga: Filmed in Iceland, McAdams stars in a movie about two life long friends hoping to reach their destiny by entering the Eurovision song contest

Starring opposite Will Ferrell, the movie which was released on Netflix, chronicles a pair of longtime friends as they try their luck at the famous Eurovision song contest. 

As Hollywood reopens amid the pandemic, McAdams will soon get back to work after she gives birth to her brewing baby sometime in the next few months.   

Upcoming projects for Rachel include Sherlock Holmes 3 which has now been pushed from a December 2020 release date to a December 2021 date. 

The film will continue to star Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law.
