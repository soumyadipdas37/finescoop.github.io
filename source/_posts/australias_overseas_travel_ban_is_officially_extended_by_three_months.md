Australians will have to wait until at least December 17 to enjoy an overseas holiday after the government extended its coronavirus travel ban. 

Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday said the decision was made on advice provided by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. 

'AHPPC has advised that the international and domestic COVID-19 situation continues to pose an unacceptable public health risk,' he said.

'The extension of the emergency period is an appropriate response to that risk.'

More to come.
