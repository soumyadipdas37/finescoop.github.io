Tatler has unveiled its annual pick of the best prep and public schools in the UK.

The society bible's Schools Guide 2021 is packed with world-class educational institutions for children aged four to 18 - and unsurprisingly, many come with eye-watering fees. 

Schools that offer yoga classes, eye-opening trips to orphanages in places such as Ghana and Cambodia, and lunchtime chefs hailing from The Ritz and Michelin-star restaurants all make the annual guide - as does one that boasts a Bake Off finalist as a geography teacher. 

And the prep school attended by Prince George and Princess Charlotte is praised for producing 'kind, thoughtful and creative' pupils who are 'willing to stand up and be heard'.

Yet again south London's Dulwich College tops the list when it comes to price - at £7,082 a term for day students and £14,782 for boarders.
