The Argentina men's rugby team have been rocked by six new coronavirus cases in their team putting the four-nation Rugby Championship in serious doubt.

The Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) named the six players to have contracted the virus, with the list of Pumas players including back Emiliano Boffelli.

Juan Cruz Mallia, Bautista Delguy, Juan Bautista Pedemonte, Rodrigo Fernandez Criado and Lucas Bur have been confirmed as the other players who have COVID-19, with all of the players 'already fulfilling preventive isolation'.

A UAR statement on Friday said: 'After completing a new round of tests in order to minimize the risk of contagion and be able to start the health bubble, the results yielded six positive cases of COVID-19 in the campus.' 

The national team were preparing to go into a two-week bio-secure bubble on Friday in preparation for the Rugby Championship where they will face South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. 

All the players were tested before entering the bubble, while the six players who tested positive were asymptomatic.

Tournament officials hope that the Rugby Championship will still go ahead, with the event pencilled in between November 7 and December 12. 

South Africa are unlikely to be able to put forward a team for the tournament due to a lack of domestic rugby taking place in the country in preparation for the event. 

This is not the first time a member of the Argentina squad has tested positive for coronavirus since the outbreak. Loose forward Javier Oretego Desio was also diagnosed with the virus last month.
