She recently said that her wedding plans were put on hold thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. 

But it seems that Samantha Jade's plans to walk down the aisle are in full swing. 

The 33-year-old Australian singer was spotted on Monday trying on wedding dresses at the Vera Wang boutique in Sydney.

Samantha, who is engaged to Pat Handlin - the son of Sony Music boss Denis Handlin, cut a casual figure in a black silk shirt and high-waited jeans.

Jules also looked ready for business, wearing a chic black blazer, a white printed T-shirt and black trousers.

Samantha couldn't wipe the smile off her face as she looked at the dresses, before looking absolutely stunning as she tried on one gown and veil. 

Jules, who is believed to be maid of honour, also helped Samantha choose some dresses to try on and looked thrilled as she helped her best friend plan her big day.

At one point, Jules was seen taking a photo of a gown - no doubt to help them choose the perfect dress. 

In May, Samantha spoke about her wedding plans on The Morning Show and said she had to put her wedding on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

'I actually started the process of planning. I had a few things actually planned then had to put it all on hold because of COVID,' Samantha said.
