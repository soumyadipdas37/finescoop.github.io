Dancing With the Stars pro dancer Cheryl Burke revealed in a new interview that she is celebrating two years of sobriety.

The 36-year-old dancer appears on Tuesday's episode of the LadyGang podcast (via US Weekly), where she spoke about her road to sobriety. 

She also revealed how her journey has brought her closer to her DWTS partner, Backstreet Boys singer AJ McLean, who has been sober for some time as well.

LadyGang podcast host Keltie Knight was speaking about her sobriety on the podcast, which lead Burke to open up as well.

'That’s why I really wanted AJ, because I’m like, for him to be maybe partnered with someone who is just, like, still fresh in the scene [or] likes to go out, I was a little worried just as a friend in a way,' Burke said.

'But then I’m glad we’re partnered up together,' she added of McLean, who had struggled with drug and alcohol issues for many years before going sober.

Burke revealed that she has not gone through the Alcoholics Anonymous program, adding it was 'just a decision that I made for myself.

The dancer got engaged to Matthew Lawrence in May 2018, with the dancer revealing that she made the decision to go sober at her engagement party. 

'And it was when Matt and I got engaged and it was during that engagement party that we were just like — or that I was like, he didn’t even know — I was just like, I was done,' she added.

The dancer also revealed that her own father, who passed away in 2018, was an alcoholic, and his history with substance abuse also factored into her going sober.

'My father passed away, and then my dad was an alcoholic, so either I was gonna crash and burn and check myself into rehab or I was gonna just quit cold turkey,' Burke said, adding, 'That’s just my personality. It’s either black or white.'

Burke and McLean have also launched their Pretty Messed Up podcast since teaming up on the show, which Burke said has been going 'great.'

Burke debuted on Dancing With the Stars in the second season of the show, which she ultimately won with 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey.

She also won the following year with Dallas Cowboys football legend Emmitt Smith, though she hasn't won since.

She was paired with NFL star Ray Lewis last season, but they were forced to withdraw after three weeks after Lewis suffered a tendon injury.
