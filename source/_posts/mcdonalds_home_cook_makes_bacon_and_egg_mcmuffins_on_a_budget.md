'I refuse to spend $5 each on a McMuffin at Maccas (yes I know the world is becoming more expensive, I get it) when I can make them myself for $10 for the lot with some left for tomorrow,' she wrote in a Facebook group.

'These were better than Maccas ones.' 

The home cook said she used egg rings she purchased from eBay for just $1 to cook the perfectly round eggs just like the fast food chain.

She explained that she typically uses the American cheese slices in the muffins but she opted for tasty cheese instead after her other option was sold out.

Hundreds were impressed with her homemade McMuffins, while others revealed they have been able to save a lot of money creating their own versions at home.

'I make them too with the American cheese from Coles, it tastes just like Macca's. I make six for $10. And when I make them, I wrap them in a paper towel and put in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds... so good,' one woman said.

A second woman said: 'You can get burger cheese slices from Coles, Tastes exactly like Macca's cheese. And your muffins will taste identical. We haven't done them any other way since.'

A third woman said: 'I love bacon and egg muffins, it's the best. It's so quick and easy and the muffins are yummy,' while another home cook added: 'I make them at home all the time, the Coles brand smokey cheese slices taste like McDonald's.'
