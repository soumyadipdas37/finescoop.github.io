In July last year, Eddie asked to be called a ‘she’, despite previously refusing to be pinned down on gender, describing an identity that is ‘boyish and girlish’.

While receiving an honorary degree at Swansea University, she made the request.

The ceremony’s press release uses female pronouns to celebrate Izzard’s career, saying: ‘In 2009 she completed 43 marathons in 51 days…

'She has been a Labour party activist for most of her life… She twice attempted to be elected for a seat on Labour’s National Executive.’ A university spokesman said: ‘We were asked by Eddie to use her/she pronouns in the press release.’

Izzard identified as a transvestite on rising to prominence in the 80s, but more recently has preferred to use the term ‘transgender’.

Last night Izzard told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When I’m in girl mode I am happy to be known as “she” and when I’m in boy-mode, I am happy to be known as “he”. But I am equally happy to be referred to as Eddie or “Hey mate”.’ 

The Icons exhibition is listed on The Art House Gallery's website as: 'From Hollywood legends, to Rock & Roll superstars and theatrical celebs, icons have been an inspiration for a wave of artists exploring pop culture and beyond.
