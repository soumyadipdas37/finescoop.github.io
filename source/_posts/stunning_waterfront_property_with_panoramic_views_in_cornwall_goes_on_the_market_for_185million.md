A stunning waterfront property that once served as a navigation aid for mariners has gone on the market for £1.85million.

The aptly-named Beacon stands on a commanding position at Mylor Creek, Cornwall, has helped sailors navigate the waters there for years.

The house, built in 1901, has been restored and improved to make the most of the stunning panoramic views across Mylor Harbour and the River Fal.  

The Beacon has 1,745 sq ft of accommodation across the main house and separate annexe, which could be rented out as a holiday let.

From the property there is a footpath providing a direct route to the harbour.

The Beacon, so-called because it is reputed to have helped sailors navigate the stunning Mylor Creek in Cornwall, sits in a commanding position over the water

The main house has an open plan kitchen/living room, three bedrooms, a study or fourth bedroom, a bathroom and an additional toilet, while the annexe provides another kitchen, sitting room, bedroom and bathroom 

Matthew Rowe, from estate agents Rohrs & Rowe, who are selling the property, said: 'The Beacon is a lovely property. It is set in its own private grounds and is very private'

The open plan living space has the best of the views thanks to floor to ceiling windows on one side and a balcony running down most of the other side of the building.

The gardens include a woodland area and a variety of terraces below offering different viewpoints of the water.

It also has a barbecue lodge with a fire pit and a boat store.

'It has views over the river directly in front of you but also to the back to the little village behind it, Mylor Bridge. It also looks out into the Carrick Roads, which is a favourite sailing water for boating enthusiasts, that's the big draw of this house,' said Matthew Rowe, from estate agents Rohrs & Rowe

'It has views over the river directly in front of you but also to the back to the little village behind it, Mylor Bridge. It also looks out into the Carrick Roads, which is a favourite sailing water for boating enthusiasts, that's the big draw of this house.

'The views are the knock-out thing for that house, even the annexe on the ground floor has spectacular views.

'Everyone who turns up to look at it just goes 'wow'.

'It is believed to have been used as a navigation aid for sailors, there are several properties in the area called The Beacon that served that purpose.

'The owners have renovated it since they've been there but there is still things you could do - the loft could be converted,' Mr Rowe said

'The house is almost at the end of a little access lane. It's a no through road so there's no passing traffic,' Mr Rowe said

'The house has boat storage and about 50 yards from the bottom of the driveway there's a little beach area that you can launch onto the water from, that's shared by the four houses at the end of the lane,' Mr Rowe said

'You can even walk round the headland to Flushing, there's lots of lovely walks in that area.

'It's a popular location, you get a mix of people that want to be there permanently and those for holidays.'

Mylor is a sought-after location and is particularly popular with sailors.
