Former Bachelor Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson just celebrated his first Father's Day alongside daughter, Marlie-Mae. 

And the 33-year-old appears to be doing a pretty good job of being a dad according to his fiancée Laura Byrne. 

Taking to Instagram, Laura shared a number of sweet photos of Matty J and their daughter enjoying a range of activities together.

The ToniMay designer wrote: 'Happy Fathers Day to all the Dad's out there, but most of all to this magnificent Dad.'

She continued: 'Marlie won the official Dad lotto with you. WE LOVE YOU!!!!' 

It comes after Matty J spoke about his own estrangement from his father, following his parents divorce when he was just 12-years-old.

Matt told The Sydney Morning Herald he fully understands his mother's struggles and also gushed about his joy at being a stay-at-home dad.   

'I've been able to be the stay-at-home dad and get to know my daughter. It's been quite amazing,' he told the publication.

He said: 'My parents divorced when I was 12. Mum raised five children on her own and worked full-time. Only now that I'm a parent can I understand how difficult that must have been.'

The doting parent also spoke about his own upbringing. 

His parental instinct is so strong that Matt admitted he gets a 'knot in his stomach' whenever he leaves Marlie-Mae's room after checking in on her during the night. 

'I feel very emotional as a dad. I was always that guy who noticed other dads in the park playing with their kids long before I had my own child.'

Matty and Laura became engaged with Matty J in April 2019. 

The pair first met on season five of The Bachelor in 2017, and welcomed their daughter Marlie-May in June last year. 

Speaking on the So Dramatic podcast, Matty recently clarified a common question he gets asked, which is if the Bachelor gets to choose which girls he dates and who goes home.

'That decision is entirely at the hands of The Bachelor. You get to pick exactly which girls you go on dates with, and who stays and who goes home.

'Even the order of the rose ceremony. It is up to you. He decides everything, it's all up to him.'
