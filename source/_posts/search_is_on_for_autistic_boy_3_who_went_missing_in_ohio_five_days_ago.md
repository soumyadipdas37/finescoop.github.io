Police, family members and volunteers continued their search for an autistic three-year-old boy who went missing from his home in Ohio last Friday after possibly falling out of a window.

The FBI in Cleveland on Sunday announced a $5,000 reward for information leading to the successful recovery of Braylen Noble, who was reported missing at around noon on Friday from his family's home on Gibraltar Heights Drive in Toledo.

On Monday, nearly 100 volunteers spent hours scouring a three-mile radius around the Hunter's Ridge apartment complex and handing out fliers about the missing person case. 

Braylen Noble is a three-year-old non-verbal autistic boy who vanished from his family's apartment in Toledo, Ohio, on Friday afternoon. He is the subject of an intense search that has come to involve the FBI 

Volunteers are seen on Monday searching for Braylen around his family's apartment complex on Gibraltar Heights Drive

Braylen's mother, Dajnae Cox, took part in the search effort and tearfully appealed to whoever might have her son to return him to her.  

'If you want to just drop him off somewhere, please drop him off to the police station, you can drop him off here. Call my phone,' Cox told NBC24 through sobs. 'I know he's crying, I know you can't get him to stop crying. He's being picky, he's not eating and even if he's scared I won't be mad. Please just drop him off to me. I just want him home. That's it.'

Braylen was reported missing at around 12.30pm, about half-an-hour after his mother said her son either jumped or fell our of a third-floor window in the family's apartment in the 3400 block of Gibraltar Heights.

In an interview with WTOL11, Cox clarified that she did not witness her son's fall but assumed it had happened because the screen in the window was pushed out. 

Braylen's mother, Dajnae Cox, begged for her son's safe return. She asked whoever might have her child to just drop him off at a police station 

She said Braylen could not have snuck out the front door of the apartment because both her and the boy's grandmother were home at the time. 

When Cox went downstairs to get her son, he was nowhere to be found. 

As a newly released 911 call reporting Braylen's disappearance indicates, the adults in the family spent about 30 minutes searching the apartment complex and the surrounding area for the child before contacting the authorities. 

'I'm hoping he's OK, but we don't know where he's at,' the caller, a woman named Bobbie, tells the dispatcher on the call. 'We walked the whole grounds.' 

Officers conducted a thorough search for the missing non-verbal boy using drones, K-9 units and dive teams, which scoured Swan Creek that runs behind the apartment complex, but to no avail. 

Cox has been interviewed by police but not arrested, despite rumors to the contrary on social media. 

Toledo police Lt. Dan Gerken has described Braylen's family as being absolutely cooperative. 

On Sunday, as emergency crews continued searching for the missing child, Braylen's grandparents organized a prayer vigil and pleaded for his safe return. 

His mother believes that Braylen either fell or jumped from his third-floor window. When she went downstairs to get him, he was nowhere to be found 

'It’s been stressful. I’m emotionally drained. I’m physically drained but I keep on pushing on,' Jessie Holloway, Braylen’s grandmother, told 13ABC.

On Monday, the search for Braylen expanded into neighboring Michigan, where the FBI was said to be checking a trash storage facility. 

Braylen was last seen wearing pull-up diapers and a red and white Mickey Mouse shirt. The boy does not like loud noises and he will respond to the nickname 'Fats' or short phrases like 'come here.'

Anyone with any information concerning Braylen’s whereabouts is being urged to call law enforcement at 419-255-1111.
