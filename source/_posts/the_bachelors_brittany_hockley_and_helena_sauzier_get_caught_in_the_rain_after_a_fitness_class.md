They're both staples when it comes to appearing on reality dating shows. 

But Brittany Hockley, 33, and Helena Sauzier, 25, opted for a girls' day on Saturday.  

The two friends were spotted enjoying a boxing class together in Bronte, before stepping out for a bite to eat. 

Let's hear it for the girls! The Bachelor's Brittany Hockley, 33, and Helena Sauzier, 25, (L) got caught in the rain after a fitness class in Sydney's Bronte on Saturday

The two women enjoyed a leisurely stroll following the intense sweat session. 

Braving the wet weather, they then appeared to make a run for it to their vehicles. 

For the outing, Brittany wore a pair of pale blue tights which she paired with a fashionable black hoodie. 

She carried her belongings in a white tote bag.

The radiographer wore her brunette hair in a ponytail.  

Meanwhile, Helena opted to wear a P.E Nation workout set which flashed her toned stomach and clung to her trim pins. 

The blonde beauty finished the look with a pair of snakeskin gloves.

It comes after Brittany was spotted on a coastal walk in Sydney with a mystery male companion. 

At one stage, she and her friend sat down on some rocks and shared an intimate conversation while looking out to the ocean.  

Brittany looked like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders, after being forced to keep her split from Timm Hanly under wraps for eight months.

Speaking on her Life Uncut podcast in August, Brittany said she was 'gobsmacked' by how much Timm, 27, changed after filming Bachelor in Paradise.

'We had probably a week where it was really nice and normal. And then it just took a downward turn rapidly - deteriorated rapidly,' she admitted.  

'And we had a bit of a falling out over Timm's behaviour, and I literally didn't hear from him again,' she added.

The single life: Speaking on her Life Uncut podcast earlier this month, Brittany said she was 'gobsmacked' by how much Timm, 27, changed after filming Bachelor in Paradise

'He just wanted to drink and have fun with his friends, and no part of him wanted a relationship at all.'

Bachelor in Paradise was filmed in Fiji from November to December last year, and aired on Channel 10 between July and August.

A few weeks after they left the show together, Timm 'ghosted' Brittany and reunited with his ex-girlfriend Briana De La Motte.

'We had probably a week where it was really nice and normal. And then it just took a downward turn rapidly - deteriorated rapidly,' Brittany said of her relationship with Timm (pictured)
