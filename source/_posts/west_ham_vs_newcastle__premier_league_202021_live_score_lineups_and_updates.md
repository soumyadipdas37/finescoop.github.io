West Ham welcome Newcastle United in the Premier League to wrap up the opening day action in the top flight.

The Hammers were battling relegation for much of last season but David Moyes will be hoping for improvements at the London Stadium this term. 

Sportsmail's DAN RIPLEY will provide live EPL coverage of West Ham vs Newcastle including live score, lineups and build-up. 

Host commentator

Well... if it is, it's going to have to do a lot to trump Liverpool vs Leeds United, but I'm hopeful of an exciting encounter at the London Stadium as I welcome you to our live coverage of West Ham United vs Newcastle United
