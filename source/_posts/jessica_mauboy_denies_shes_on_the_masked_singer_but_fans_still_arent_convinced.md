Jessica Mauboy did an unconvincing job of denying she's on this year's season of The Masked Singer during an interview on The Project on Monday.

The 31-year-old singer appeared on the program to discuss her work with the Indigenous Literacy Foundation ahead of Indigenous Literacy Day on Wednesday.

At the very end of her interview, host Waleed Aly asked Jess about persistent rumours she's one of the contestants on The Masked Singer.

'I'm afraid we've got to leave it there, because Masked Singer is about to begin. Are you on it?' the 42-year-old asked her outright.

After laughing awkwardly, Jessica half-heartedly denied she was on the show, clearly amused by the forthright question.

'Oh, no! Definitely not!' she said with a hint of sarcasm, seemingly unable to keep a straight face.

Understandably, Waleed was unconvinced, with the Little Things singer doing little to dispel the rumours.

'That's exactly what someone who's on it would say... We'll see you in a few minutes!' added Waleed.

Fans of the singing show remain convinced Jess is the Bushranger, voicing their opinions openly on Twitter.

'I think Bushranger is Jessica Mauboy the voice matches,' commented another, while one fan wrote, 'Jessica Mauboy isn't even trying to hide it anymore'. 

Added another: 'It's SO clearly @jessicamauboy as the bushranger, girl your voice is too iconic and recognisable'.
