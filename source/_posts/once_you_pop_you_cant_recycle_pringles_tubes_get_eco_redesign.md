The container is being redesigned after criticism that it was too difficult to recycle

They are best known for their ‘once you pop you can’t stop’ slogan.

But the Pringles tube and lid which makes for the distinctive sound could be in for a change. 

The container is being redesigned after criticism that it was too difficult to recycle.

Its current metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid and foil-lined cardboard sleeve make it the ‘number one recycling villain’ according to the Recycling Association.

Now Kellogg’s, which makes the snack, is testing out simpler cans in an attempt to make them more eco-friendly.

The new cans are made from around 90 per cent paper, one with a recyclable plastic lid and the other a paper lid, pictured, and are being trialled in some Tesco stores.

Kellogg’s said they will still produce the ‘pop’ – but experts say more needs to be done to improve the design. In 2017 Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association, highlighted the difficulties surrounding Pringles packaging.

He has welcomed the new can – but said it’s not a full solution.

‘This new Pringles tube that is being trialled is a big improvement on its predecessor as it is much easier to recycle,’ he said. 

‘However, we have always maintained that it is easier to recycle packaging based on as few materials as possible.’

A Kellogg’s spokesman said: ‘As part of the trial we will get feedback so we can create the best Pringles can of the future.’ 

The other 10 per cent of the new can is a polyal – a type of plastic – barrier that protects against oxygen and moisture.

The polyal-coated card will need to be tested to see if it is recyclable.
