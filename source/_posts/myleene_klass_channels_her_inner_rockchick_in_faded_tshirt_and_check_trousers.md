Myleene Klass had a spring in her step on Friday as she ended her week in a decidedly edgy ensemble.

The presenter, 42, offered a beaming smile as she made her way to work at Global Radio Studios sporting punk inspired check trousers and a chunky black boots.  

She added to her look with what at first glance appeared to be a faded rock concert T-shirt, but was in fact a printed top from Swedish high-street chain The Kooples.

The Smooth Radio host added to her look with a faded denim jacket, while a quilted red leather Chanel bag gave the ensemble a sophisticated flourish. 

Accessorising tastefully, Myleene sported heavily tinted sunglasses as she greeted onlookers while making her way across London's Leicester Square. 

The presenter's latest appearance came after her recent social media run-in with a troll who claimed her boyfriend Simon Motson will cheat on her.

She recently posted a gallery of images with the PR executive, 45, to celebrate their five year anniversary as a couple.

However a troll wrote underneath: 'Not long before this one cheats on you. Dear oh dear, heading for the lawyers are we?'

In a pointed response, she fired back: 'He wishes! Cheating exes usually get a house, a car and a fat pay-off, in what appeared to be a dig at her ex-husband Graham Quinn, who left her on her 34th birthday in 2012.

The incident came just six months after the couple's wedding, but they had been together for 11 years after meeting when Graham became the bodyguard for defunct pop group Hear'Say.

Myleene, who shares daughters, Ava, 13, and Hero, nine with Graham, was devastated to learn that he had secretly bought a bachelor pad for himself – meaning that he must have been planning his departure for some time.

The presenter is now in a happy relationship with Simon, who she began dating in 2015 after being introduced by two mutual friends, and the pair welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.
