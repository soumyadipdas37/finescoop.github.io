It comes as a trial takes place in the French capital concerned with the January 2015 attacks that shocked the world.

They saw three gunmen linked to Al-Qaeda and Islamic State travel around the Paris slaughtering 15 civilians and two serving police officers at will.

Their primary targets were staff at Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine which had published a series of cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammed.

The principal terrorists – who were all known to the French security services – were all gunned down by police themselves, but 14 defendants in the current trial facing life in prison for 'complicity in terrorism'.
