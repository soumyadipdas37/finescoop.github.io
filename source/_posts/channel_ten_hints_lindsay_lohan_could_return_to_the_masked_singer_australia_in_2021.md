Hollywood star Lindsay Lohan, 34, could reprise her role on the panel of The Masked Singer Australia next year. 

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph this week, Channel Ten's head of entertainment Stephen Tate said they would 'love to have her back' on the show.  

'Lindsay is still very much a friend of the show and all of the team,' he said.

Lindsay starred as a judge on the celebrity panel for Australia's inaugural season of The Masked Singer Australia in 2019, but due to COVID-19 was unable to return for season two.

Stephen went on to say that Lindsay had been in contact during this season. 

'She has been in touch throughout this whole thing [filming]. Of course, we would love to have her back [on the show],' he added.

The network executive finished by saying: 'Let's see what 2021 brings.' 

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lindsay was replaced by New Zealand comedian, Urzila Carlson, this season.

The Hollywood actress was reportedly 'upset' after not being able to star on the show.

It comes amid news Lindsay severed ties with the rest of the cast on Instagram. Fans noticed she seemingly unfollowed the trio. 

She is no longer following Jackie 'O' Henderson, Dannii Minogue or Dave Hughes. Interestingly, all three are still following Lindsay.   

Despite the snub, panellist Jackie 'O' Henderson said she 'loved' what the star brought to the show while speaking to WHO magazine.

'We've stayed in touch after she was on the panel last year. She's so upset that she couldn't make it back to Australia, but it just wasn't possible,' Jackie said last month.  

'I know she'll try and watch it from her home. I loved what she brought to the show last year.'

Last month, New Zealand comedian Urzila explained why she was a better fit for The Masked Singer than the Mean Girls actress.

'A lot of people said the same – Lindsay didn't know any of the people,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'At least I've worked with a lot of people in the industry and I've been coming [to Australia] with my show for 11 years, doing everything from Fringes to comedy festivals. I'm sure I'll have more of a clue here,' she added.

The Masked Singer continues on Channel Ten, Monday at 7:30pm.
