Liverpool have boosted ahead of their Premier League showdown with Arsenal as goalkeeper Alisson has passed a late fitness test. 

However, marquee signing Thiago Alcantara misses out for the clash at Anfield - as the Reds look to continue their perfect start to the season against the Gunners, who also have a 100 per cent record in this campaign so far. 

Both players were serious doubts before the match as they missed the Premier League champions' training sessions over the weekend, though they did took late fitness tests on Monday.

Both Alisson and Thiago were crucial in Liverpool's important 2-0 win over Chelsea last weekend. The former saved a second-half penalty from Jorginho to keep his first clean sheet of the new season. 

Meanwhile, Thiago outpassed every Blues player in the second period of the match at Stamford Bridge - even though he only played 45 minutes. 

Klopp already had midfielders Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ruled out of the Arsenal match, with the Liverpool captain injuring himself in the Chelsea match last weekend.

But Joe Gomez has returned for Liverpool after missing the Chelsea game, meaning Fabinho returns to midfield alongside Gini Wijnaldum and Naby Keita.  

Ahead of Monday night's showdown on Merseyside, Liverpool and Arsenal are the only two teams out of the 'Big Six' to have not dropped league points this season. 

The Reds have started their Premier League title defence with wins over Leeds United and Chelsea, while Arsenal have beaten London rivals Fulham and West Ham in the build-up to the Liverpool fixture.

The north Londoners have also won their last two matches against Liverpool - a 2-1 league victory at the Emirates Stadium in July before beating Klopp's side in the Community Shield on penalties last month. 

Liverpool XI: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Keita, Mane, Salah, Firmino 

Arsenal XI: Leno, Holding, David Luiz, Tierney, Bellerin, Elneny, Xhaka, Maitland-Niles, Willian, Lacazette, Aubameyang
