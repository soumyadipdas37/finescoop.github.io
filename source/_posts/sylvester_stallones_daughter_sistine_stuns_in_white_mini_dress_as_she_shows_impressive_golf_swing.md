Sylvester Stallone has long been one of the most recognizable faces in the sports world (even though he's not an actual athlete).

But the Rocky star's daughter Sistine has recently showed him up, proving that the athletic skill runs in the family. 

She stunned in a white off-the-shoulder mini dress Saturday, as she showed off her impressive golf swing, leaving her three-time Oscar nominated father speechless.

The 22-year-old stood barefoot in the grass, next to a scenic Southern California hillside, while holding her club.

Sylvester, 74, could be heard behind the camera: 'You know, it's kind of frustrating, because I used to think that golf was my thing. Then all of the sudden, you think you can play. Alright, let's see what you've got.' 

'I can't even move in this dress,' the 47 Meters Down: Uncaged actress complained, as pops responded: 'Well that's your problem.'

He turned the camera on himself as he smirked, telling her: 'Alright, go for it. I know you're gonna miss. There's not a chance you can hit this... ball.'

Peace out: She threw up the peace sign and told her dad 'bye,' before tossing the club over her shoulder, before he yelled: 'Ow!'
