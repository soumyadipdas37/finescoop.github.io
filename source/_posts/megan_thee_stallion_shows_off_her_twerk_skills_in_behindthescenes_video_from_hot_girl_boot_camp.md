Megan Thee Stallion has recently gotten back to work, giving her first virtual concert amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

And the Houston-born rapper is giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse at how she's preparing for her next big performance. 

She served some jiggle Saturday, as she took to Instagram to show off her signature curves and her impressive twerk skills in a video from what appeared to be her dance rehearsal.

The 25-year-old put on a sizzling display in a grey camouflage Fashion Nova crop top and matching short shorts, which hugged her derrière.

She sat in the floor in a perfect split, shaking her rear to the music, as her dancers did some stretches in the background.

The Savage artist has bounced back in epic fashion, since she was shot in both feet by Tory Lanez, 28, back in July, following a heated argument.

She said to Lanez last month during an Instagram Live: 'You shot me. And you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and s***. Stop lying. Why lie? I don't understand.'

Megan previously shared photos of her wounds (shortly before deleting them), after trolls claimed she was lying about the shooting.

She wrote: 'I usually don’t address internet bulls*** but y’all people are so sick! God was really watching over me and I’m healing so well! Sorry I’m not as sad and miserable as a lot of y’all lol but ima keep being Megan Thee Mf STALLION.'

Drunk defense: TMZ recently obtained text messages Lanez sent the Good Girls actress just hours after the shooting on July 12, claiming he was 'just too drunk' (pictured in June, 2019)

The Canadian rapper also wrote: 'I know u prolly never gone talk to me again, but I genuinely want u to know I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart.'

Although Lanez has not been arrested or charged for the shooting, the Los Angeles county DA is considering charging him with felony assault with a firearm, according to TMZ. 

Megan has since been thriving, releasing her pop culture phenomenon WAP last month with Cardi B, which debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100.
