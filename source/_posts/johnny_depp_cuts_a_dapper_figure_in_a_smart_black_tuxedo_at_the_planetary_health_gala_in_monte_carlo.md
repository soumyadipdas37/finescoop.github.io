Johnny kept his locks in a loose, disheveled style, while he rounded off his look with round, tortoiseshell glasses.  

The film star was sure to follow guidelines as he also held a black face mask in his hand.  

Hosted by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the gala gathers leading philanthropists, talents and scientists to join forces and launch the charity's initiatives to bridge the widening gap between health and the environment.

The 2020 Monte-Carlo Gala for Planetary Health aims to highlight the idea that our future is dependent on healthy ecosystems.

Hosted by the Prince’s foundation, it has gathered talents, philanthropists, decision makers and scientists to discuss the challenges the planet’s environment faces.

The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.

Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.

However it's likely this year's event has seen drastic changes to ensure social distancing can be adhered to, with many stars also donning masks as they arrived on the blue carpet.

It's been a busy week for the star as on Sunday he attended the premiere of his new film Crock Of Gold: A Few Rounds With Shane MacGowan.

Father-of-two Depp is a longtime friend of The Pogues' MacGowan, 62, and even performed on his first album. 

His film on the musician, directed by Julien Temple, combines unseen footage from the band and MacGowan's family and is described as a 'celebration' of the star. 

Star-studded: Milutin Gatsby, Helen Mirren, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Princess Charlene of Monaco, Andy Garcia and Kate Beckinsale were among the guests at the gala
