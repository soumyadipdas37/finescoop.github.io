A scientist has revealed why you should never keep your skincare or makeup products in the bathroom, and how doing so can lead to you putting fecal matter on your face.

Founder of Qr8 Dr Michele Squire, from Brisbane, explained that everything in a bathroom from heat and light to steam and water can negatively affect the formulas of our skincare and makeup.

But the worst culprit of all is the toilet, as if you flush it with the seat up, this can lead to particles of bacteria ending up in your moisturiser or lipstick.

'Of course, there is a huge convenience factor about keeping our products in the bathroom so that when we jump out of the shower at night or in the morning, we can directly get started on our skincare routine,' Dr Squire told the Adore Beauty podcast.

'But the problem with the bathroom and particularly the bathroom shelf is that it's very exposed. 

'Heat, humidity, visible light like sunlight and artificial light are all able to get into our skincare.'

The scientist said that each product you own has 'lots of molecules which move around all the time and bang together constantly undergoing reactions'.

When you add light, heat and oxygen into the mix, this speeds up these reactions and the general degradation process, resulting in products with changed texture, smell, colour and activity on the skin.

If you want to stop fecal matter from when you flush the toilet ending up in your beauty products, you could try something like a beauty fridge (pictured)

Dr Squire said one of the worst issues associated with keeping your products in the bathroom is the matter of the toilet.

'When you flush the toilet and leave the lid up, you produce this big plume of bacteria and microbes into the air,' she said.

'If you're in a hurry and you've got all of your cosmetics open and you happen to be the type of person who flushes without putting the lid down, you're in danger of ending up with fecal microbes in your cosmetics and on your face.'

She advises closing anything as soon as you've used it and never leaving the lids off your products for too long.

Dr Squire said you don't have to spend big in order to get science-driven good skincare, especially with something like cleanser that isn't on your face for very long. She likes the skincare brand, CeraVe (pictured) and their hydrating cleanser

When it comes to where you should store your beauty products, the ideal location is somewhere cool and dark, ideally between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius.

'If you're wedded to the idea of keeping your skincare products in the bathroom, I would recommend something like a beauty fridge so you can keep your products cool,' Dr Squire said.

She added that this is especially useful if you live somewhere excessively cool or hot.

You could also try keeping your products outside of the bathroom and transporting them to and from it when you apply them if you like the lighting in there.

A general rule of thumb is that an unopened skincare product will last for three years, but once it's open, you should check the packaging, as it will often detail exactly how long you've got before you should toss something out.

'A good way to tell if something is gone off is to look for changes,' Dr Squire added.

'A change in colour, texture, smell or separation could mean it's past its best before date.'
