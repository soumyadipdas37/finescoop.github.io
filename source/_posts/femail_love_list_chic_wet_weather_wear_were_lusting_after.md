With most of us having turned to loungewear in the past few months, these cargo pants from Danish brand Rains won’t take you too far out of your comfort zone.

They’ve been designed to withstand wet weather, and the lightweight, breathable fabric makes them perfect for exercise.

The elasticated waist adds comfort, while the elastic strings at the ankle keep them watertight. They have four pockets, too, making them handy if you want to leave your bag at home.

They also fit well over chunky puddle-stomping boots, which complement this style brilliantly.
