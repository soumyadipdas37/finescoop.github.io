Former Channel 10 weatherman Tim Bailey is now set for a return to radio after his controversial sacking from the TV network in August.

The 57-year-old received the job offer just 20 minutes after Ten announced the mass lay-offs as part of budget-cuts at the network.

Tim will now read weather bulletins for 2GB, thanks to quick-thinking Nine star and 2GB host Ben Fordham.  

Career: Tim Bailey, 57, (pictured) has revealed his next big career move with him now going to radio station 2GB, according to a report in The Sunday Telegraph this week

Reported in The Sunday Telegraph this week, Tim said: 'In that moment you begin to doubt everything you've ever worked for and ever done.'

He said his new 2GB gig will give him a 'second chance' on radio.

'Ten letting me go turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me in a way,' Tim said of the sacking.

New opportunities: 'So Ten letting me go turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me in a way,' Tim said of the sacking

He continued: 'Which is kind of funny when you think about it but also goes to show, if you stay positive, you never know what's around the corner.'

Tim explained he was only two years from retirement. Before the 2GB opportunity, he did have an eye on writing children's books. 

Ten viewers were left shocked in August when news of Tim's axing was announced after 28 years with the network. 

End of an era: Tim, along with at least 24 other stars, including Studio 10's Kerri-Anne and journalist Natarsha Belling, were sacked in a brutal afternoon of budget cuts last month

Rumours circulated last month that he could be on Ten's next instalment of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!   

Tim, along with at least 24 other stars, including Studio 10's Kerri-Anne and journalist Natarsha Belling, were sacked in a brutal afternoon of budget cuts in August.

Staff members were informed that the news and operations department was being 'restructured' in response to the sharp decline in advertising revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

His next move? The Sacked Channel 10 weatherman was reportedly tipped to enter the jungle on the next season of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! 

Channel Ten newsreader Sandra Sully paid tribute to Tim Bailey this month. 

'Heavy hearts today, and Tim Bailey we're talking about you,' she began. 

'On behalf of the team, it has been an absolute privilege, honour and such a pleasure to work alongside you my friend for the past 30 years,' Sandra added.

She continued:'You have been a grinning, upbeat, bright and shining light in our day, every single day.'

'I know viewers feel the same. We simply couldn't say goodbye without seeing some of your finest moments, bringing a smile to all our dials', she said while she held back tears.
