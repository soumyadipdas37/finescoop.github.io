Deborra-Lee Furness addressed long-running rumours husband Hugh Jackman is 'gay' during her appearance on Anh's Brush with Fame on Tuesday.

The 64-year-old actress and producer rolled her eyes when asked about the persistent rumours by the show's host, Anh Do. 

'I see these magazines and they're so mean-spirited… I hope people realise it's all made up,' she said.

She added: '[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married. 

'It's just wrong. It's like someone saying to Elton John, "Oh he's straight." I'm sure he'd be p**sed! 

'And so what! What are we discussing here… Is he a vegetarian… Is he gay?' 

Rumours surrounding Hugh's sexuality have plagued the 51-year-old multi-talented actor for most of his career. 

'I see these magazines and they're so mean-spirited… I hope people realise it's all made up,' she said

Deborra-Lee said she also finds it frustrating when people tell her how 'lucky' she is to be married to The Greatest Showman star - and how sometimes people make her feel like she's 'won a chook raffle'. 

'People don't realise that it's actually rude to say that,' she said.

'Lucky because he's a stud muffin and all that … but that's showbiz and Hollywood and the brand of Hugh Jackman.' 

'[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married,' she said

But after 24 years of marriage, Deborra-Lee said she's come to realise it's all part of being married to a Hollywood heartthrob.

Deborra-Lee also spoke about meeting Hugh on the set of the Australian TV series, Correlli, back in 1995.

She revealed there was an 'instant attraction' between them, and said they confessed their feelings for each other in Hugh's kitchen one night and have been together ever since.
