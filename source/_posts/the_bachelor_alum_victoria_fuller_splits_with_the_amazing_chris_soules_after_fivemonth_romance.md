The Bachelor #24 alum Victoria Fuller announced Wednesday that she ended her five-month romance with The Bachelor #19 Chris Soules, who apparently wanted her to move to his native Iowa.

'I'm not moving to Iowa anytime soon,' the Virginia-born 26-year-old told The Viall Files.

'He is an amazing man and he deserves somebody super awesome who's willing to go to Iowa and live in Iowa and right now, I'm not there yet. Maybe I will be in a couple [of] years.'

Victoria said she still talks to the 38-year-old fourth-generation farmer 'all the time' but she's 'in a different place than he is' at the moment.

'I just want to focus on myself right now,' Fuller explained. 'I'm not a farmer, but I know a lot about f***ing corn now.'

The medical sales rep began quarantining with Chris in April three weeks after being connected by his former prospective bride, Kelsey Weier.

'[Kelsey] basically just, like, set it up and he ended up texting me within like five minutes of her giving him my number,' Victoria recalled.
