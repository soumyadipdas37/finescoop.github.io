A heavily-tattooed former Bandidos chapter president has revealed how he became a member of the club after a tough childhood in country Australia. 

Bjorn Steven Luba, 35, uploaded a video to the Instagram account of the clothing company he owns, Criminal Muscle, on Monday night. 

Mr Luba said he lived in Switzerland until he moved to Australia when he was 10-years-old, enlisted in the Army after high school and eventually joined the outlaw motorcycle gang.  

Mr Luba (pictured with partner) said he lived in Switzerland until he moved to Australia at ten-years-old, enlisted in the Army after high school and joined the outlaw motorcycle gang  

He explained that the reason he believes he was able to survive the brutal world of motorcycle gangs was because he was humble. 

'Whether I was a prospect or a president never once did I act like I was better than anybody. I went to an event in Melbourne and had a conversation with a prospect who was blown away that a president was speaking to him,' Mr Luba said. 

He opens the video by explaining he would ride his bike 'three towns over' as a young kid in Switzerland to buy cassette tapes using coins he would pinch from his mother's wallet. 

Mr Luba said he was left on his own a lot as his mother had a good job at a horse stables and would run amok - adding that the other children and even the teachers were scared of him. 

He said he then moved to Australia with his mother and his step-father where they lived at a number of southern Queensland towns. 

Mr Luba's weekends would be spent shovelling horse manure, which Mr Luba claims his parents would make him do because they knew it annoyed him, until he eventually got a job at a local fruit market. 

He explained he his way up through the ranks and eventually became president of his chapter in south-east Queensland - though he explains he has now left the club 'for certain reasons' 

He warned young people that being in a club was not like a 'game' or 'movie' and that he witnessed some brutal events 

He would earn $5-an-hour packing fruit and milk crates - usually sitting in the cool room with the door open to avoid the Queensland heat - though he added the Filipino ladies who ran the shop were 'cool'. 

After high school, Mr Luba joined the Army where he completed a tour of Iraq. 

When he returned to the country he was introduced to some Bandido club members who encouraged him the join the outlaw motorcycle gang. 

Mr Luba said he worked his way up through the ranks and eventually became president of his chapter in south-east Queensland - though he explains he has now left the club 'for certain reasons'. 

While he said it would be 'hypocritical' of him to tell other young people not to join a motorcycle gang he urged his followers to 'be wise'. 

He warned young people that being in a club was not like a 'game' or 'movie' and that he witnessed some brutal events - adding anyone should think very carefully if they were considering joining.  

'The incident that made me leave - which I will also not get into cause that is a personal matter - after that I had a meeting with another club who asked me if I was going to go anywhere else,' Mr Luba said. 

He said he told the men: 'the only place I will go back to is the Bandidos - otherwise I'm done with it, they respected that'. 

'Loyalty is important if you go to one club and then go to another club willy-nilly it don't look good'. 

Mr Luba has opened a clothing business which he markets online 

He also had a warning for young people looking to make a name for themselves. 

'There are people I respect from other clubs but they didn't make a name for themselves in a few minutes, they did that over years,' he said. 

'If you walk around saying the other clubs aint sh*t that is what will get you got. We're all rowing in the same direction but there's always a few individuals who try to row the other way and those are the ones that get thrown off the boat.' 

Mr Luba said he realised he had a good run with his club and that he wanted to leave on a high. 

His parting advice for his followers was that 'there is always someone bigger than you to put you on you a** so be humble and you will gain respect'.
