Channel Seven has successfully completed filming a prime time special series of The Chase Australia under strict COVID restrictions.

Perspex screens were installed to separate the Chasers, the contestants, as well as the families and couples in the studio. 

Out of state Chasers 'Goliath' Matt Parkinson, and 'The Shark' Brydon Coverdale, based in Perth and Melbourne, respectively, also underwent two weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine before filming.

Beat the Chasers will see a contestant go up against the Chasers - 'The Supernerd' Issa Schultz, Goliath, The Shark and 'The Tiger Mum' Cheryl Toh - with more than $500,000 up for grabs.
