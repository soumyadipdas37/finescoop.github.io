She recently lost a staggering three stone in weight.

And Gemma Collins seemed keen to show off her new figure as she slipped into a figure-hugging pink gown in London on Tuesday. 

Filming new scenes for her show, Diva Forever, the 39-year-old reality star seemed in good spirits as she strolled down the Royal Victoria Docks.

Putting her hourglass curves on display, the glittering gown cinched in at her waist and grazed her peachy derriere. 

Ensuring all eyes would be on her, the baby pink gown featured strips of shimmering metallic material and a low cut neckline that offered a peek of cleavage. 

Matching her accessories to her gown, Gemma slung a baby pink Chanel bag over her shoulder and boosted her frame with a pair of feather adorned heels.

Keith posted a fun video to his Instagram Story where he revealed: 'Hi, today I am on a boat with Gemma Collins.'

To which Gemma quipped: 'The GC is on a boat!' 

With Keith adding: 'The GC is on a boat, we're about to have tea, cake and Champagne for work. That ain't work!'

He captioned the video with: 'Fun day on the Thames today with @gemmacollins1 shopping/not shopping series 2 coming soon to @itv2.'

While Gemma also took to her own Instagram  to post updates from the fun day of filming where she declared: 'Today I am going up and down the Thames with Keith Lemon. We've decided not to shop, we've decided to come down the river!'
