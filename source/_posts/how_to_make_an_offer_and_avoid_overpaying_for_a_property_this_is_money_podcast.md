Britain is in the grip of a mysterious property mini-boom.

Despite some well-deserved scepticism, talk of a property market more buoyant than it’s been in years, of viewings and offers flooding in and family homes in hot demand, doesn’t seem to just be the usual estate agent guff.

Evidence from mortgage reports, surveyors and data on estate agent activity, appears to bear this out.

The stamp duty holiday and lockdown itchy feet have combined to make parts of the market a sellers’ one, so as a buyer what can you do to get a decent offer accepted and avoid overpaying?

On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Lee Boyce talk buying homes. 

They discuss what’s going on, whether all parts of the market are flying (not quite), why some homes go to above asking price offers but others linger, and how as a buyer you can get a good deal, while as a seller you can also try to go under offer swiftly at a decent price.

Also, on this week’s show, the team discuss the rise of the lockdown trader and why more people – and younger ones at that – are buying shares.

They look at inflation and how many savings account beat it.

And finally, why has the Royal Mint said it probably won’t need to make anymore 2p pieces or £2 coins for a very long time?

Can you get a sold sign up as a buyer or a seller? Making the right offer and pricing right is key
