Piers Morgan lashed out at the toxic cancel culture pervading social media on Wednesday morning after novelist JK Rowling was targeted for writing about a transvestite killer. 

Morgan had  previously been embroiled in his own war of words with the Harry Potter creator, with the pair clashing on Twitter over British politics, Donald Trump and his notable disdain for her books. 

But the 55-year old found himself defending Rowling during a heated Good Morning Britain debate sparked by the recent publication of her latest novel, Troubled Blood, written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

Addressing journalist Benjamin Butterworth, Morgan dismissed claims that Rowling should be boycotted for writing a cross-dressing serial killer into the novel after expressing inflammatory views about the trans community on social media. 

He said: 'If I were to write a book tomorrow... I interview real killers of all shapes and sizes and genders, if I was to write a book tomorrow, it’s your position that I would not be allowed to make it a transgender killer? 

'Because that doesn’t seem very equal to me. If you’re battling for equality, surely criminals in novels could be transgender?'

Morgan also slammed the divisive RIP JK Rowing hashtag used by a minority of Twitter users in reaction to the book, Rowling's fifth in a series of crime novels featuring the fictional detective Cormoran Blue Strike.

'All those who have been contributing to the RIP JK Rowling - they’re the ones who want her dead, cancelled, shamed, vilified, finished,' he raged. 

Citing a recent review of the novel, he also pointed out that its most vocal : '[Th critics haven't read it. 

He said: 'This is a novel none of you have read, which according to Nick Cohen in his lengthy review is not remotely transphobic.' 

Difference of opinion: Addressing journalist Benjamin Butterworth (pictured)  Morgan dismissed claims that Rowling should be boycotted for writing a cross-dressing serial killer into the novel 

Rowling was initially accused of being transphobic after responding to an article headlined 'Creating a more equal post-Covid-19 world for people who menstruate'. 

She tweeted: 'People who menstruate.' I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?'

She went on to defend her comments and said: 'If sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction. If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased.

'I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn't hate to speak the truth.'

Controversy: Rowling was previously accused of being transphobic after responding to an article headlined 'Creating a more equal post-Covid-19 world for people who menstruate'

Addressing her comments in relation to the new publication on Wednesday morning, Butterworth remarked: 'She’s been tweeting derogatory comments about trans people for some months now. 

'For some years she’s been suggesting her anti-trans views, and she has reportedly, her new book under a male name indeed, features a man who dresses as a woman in order to kill. 

'A lot of people, myself included, are incredibly worried about how that smears trans people, and misrepresents them.'  

Politician George Galloway also waded into the argument, citing the 'irony' that people will be encouraged to buy the book as a result of the ongoing furore.  

Not right: Morgan also slammed the divisive RIP JK Rowing hashtag used by a minority of Twitter users in reaction to the book, Rowling's fifth in a series of crime novels 

The comment prompted co-host Susanna Reid to point out that the character in question was actually a cross-dressing man, not a transgender woman.   

Undeterred, Butterworth added: 'In a lot of people’s minds who are not familiar with the distinctions of trans people with these issues and may have seen JK’s other derogatory comments - this will be seen as a way to debase them.

'This will be seen as an insult to all transpeople - the idea we should be afraid or nervous.' 

Targeted: The Harry Potter author has continuously come under fire for her controversial views on gender identity, but vehemently denies that she is transphobic

Following the initial backlash to her Twitter posts, Mermaids - a charity that supports transgender children - urged Rowling to meet some of the young people it works with in a lengthy statement challenging her views. 

But she has since answered her critics with a 3,663 word essay posted on her website on Wednesday under the headline: 'J.K. Rowling Writes about Her Reasons for Speaking out on Sex and Gender Issues.'

She included her personal experiences with domestic abuse at the hands of her ex-husband of 18 months, Jorges Arantes.

She appeared mindful that her words might not be suitable for her younger fans by adding the sub-heading: 'Warning: This piece contains inappropriate language for children.'





Discussing: Rowling went on an extraordinary rant on Twitter rant in June, prompted a huge backlash from fans 

In it, the author revealed she was sexually assaulted in her 20s and told of her scars of domestic violence from her first marriage.

'I couldn't shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with womens and girls' safety.' 

Rowling also went on to describe her experience of domestic and sexual abuse.

'I've been in the public eye now for over twenty years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor,' she wrote.

Opening up: She answered her critics with a 3,663 word essay posted on her website on Wednesday under the headline: 'J.K. Rowling Writes about Her Reasons for Speaking out on Sex and Gender Issues' 

'This isn't because I'm ashamed those things happened to me, but because they're traumatic to revisit and remember. I also feel protective of my daughter from my first marriage. 

In her post, Rowling said she did not want to 'claim ownership' of a story which also belongs to her daughter.  

'I didn't want to claim sole ownership of a story that belongs to her, too. However, a short while ago, I asked her how she'd feel if I were publicly honest about that part of my life, and she encouraged me to go ahead,' she added.

'I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.

'I managed to escape my first violent marriage with some difficulty, but I'm now married to a truly good and principled man, safe and secure in ways I never in a million years expected to be.

'However, the scars left by violence and sexual assault don't disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you've made.

'My perennial jumpiness is a family joke – and even I know it's funny – but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do for hating sudden loud noises, or finding people behind me when I haven't heard them approaching.'  

Rowling also declared she had 'deep concerns' about the pressures young people face to transition to another gender.
