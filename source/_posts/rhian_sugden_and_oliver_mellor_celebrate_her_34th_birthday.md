Rhian Sugden celebrated her 34th birthday in style on Friday night. 

The former glamour model cut a glamorous figure as she headed out for dinner with her husband Oliver Mellor, 39, and friends at The Ivy in Manchester.

Rhian looked lovely in a lilac polka dot minidress which made the most of her tanned legs.

The minidress cinched in Rhian's slender waist and featured pleated detailing on the skirt. 

She added a boost to her height with nude Louboutin stilettos and complemented her birthday outfit with a metallic gold shoulder bag. 

Rhian amped up the glamour by styling her hair in voluminous curls and accentuated her bronzed complexion with a full face of make-up.

Oliver, meanwhile, cut a dapper figure in a striped shirt, leather jacket and jeans. 

The couple appeared in the throes of love as they headed into the restaurant.  

Earlier this month, Rhian revealed she put on a half a stone during lockdown but is embracing her new curves. 

She wrote on Instagram: 'Has anyone else packed on a few pounds in lockdown? I’ve put on over half a stone and can’t for the life of me get motivated to go to the gym.  

'But putting my gym gear on is a step in the right direction right?

'I wish I was one of those people that enjoys working out and running etc... I just like eating and laying down too much.' 

The glamour model is married to former Coronation Street actor Oliver and the couple have been enduring gruelling IVF for 20 months.    

 After discovering that she wouldn’t be able to conceive naturally,  they went through two rounds of IVF and are planning their third.

Throughout the process, experts recommended she stopped using all cosmetic products that contain hash chemicals or additives, which is when she decided to go tan-free for over 12 months.
