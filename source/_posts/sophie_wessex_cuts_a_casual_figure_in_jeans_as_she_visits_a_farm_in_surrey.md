The Countess of Wessex cut a casual figure as she visited Coverwood Farm in Cranleigh, Surrey, on Thursday. 

Sophie, 55, wrapped up warm in a navy roll neck jumper and matching raincoat complete with orange piping detail as she stepped out in the grisly weather conditions this morning. 

The royal, who donned a pair of casual blue jeans, opted for below-the-knee brown boots and completed her outfit with a long silver necklace which featured ball pedant.

During her visit, Sophie met the farmer and his family, looked at some of the animals and the new Provenance Cuts building where she unveiled a plaque at the end of the visit.

Later, Sophie - who is married to the Queen's youngest son Prince Edward - was spotted grabbing some lunch and a hot drink from a snack van. 

The Countess opted to wear her blonde hair scraped back in a ponytail and appeared to keep her makeup minimal.

The royal's visit comes just days after she was joined by her husband and their two children Lady Louise and James, 16, Viscount Severn, 12, as they took to Southsea Beach in Portsmouth to pick up litter.  

The Countess similarly donned a pair of blue denim skinny jeans, but instead paired them with a pink and white pair of deck shoes, while her hair was swept back in an elegant bun.

A day earlier, Sophie was spotted riding a horse and carriage in the grounds of the Queen's residence in Berkshire. 

Former PR executive Sophie lives at Bagshot Park in Surrey, with Edward and their two children and is widely recognised to be the Queen's favourite royal.   

The Queen and Sophie's close bond is said to be down to their similar interests, with the pair often spending Saturday or Sunday evenings together at Windsor, watching old war films and historical documentaries.

Sophie, who was brought up in Kent by a tyre company executive father and a secretary mother, is even thought to have convinced the Queen to watch The Crown - suggesting she might enjoy the Netflix series which is based on her reign.  

The Wessex family are often spotted taking part in outdoor activities at Windsor Castle, which is just 10 miles from their home at Bagshot Park.  

The royal was happy to engage i conversation with delighted staff who worked behind the snack van
