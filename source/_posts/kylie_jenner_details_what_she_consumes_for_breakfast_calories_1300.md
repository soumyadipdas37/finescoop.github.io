Kylie Jenner showed her fans what she consumes for breakfast and it's not a tiny little snack to tie her over until lunch but rather a very proper meal.

In new images shared to her Instagram Stories the 23-year-old makeup mogul offered a close-up look at the dishes that looked quite delicious.

In one post was eggs, bacon and avocado toast, in another was pancakes with a berry sauce and a third saw a blueberry muffin dusted with powdered sugar. The total calories count for all three dishes is over 1,300.

It is not known if she ate all three plates but she likely had some of it in the series of posts that went up on Wednesday morning.

Three scrambles eggs is about 234 calories. Two slices of bacon is around 90 calories.

When avocado toast is made with whole grain bread and one third of an avocado is used, it's 260 calories.

Two small pancakes with jelly on top and syrup with butter is in the ballpark of 300 calories.

The total calorie combination is 1,334. The daily recommended calories in the US is 2,000, which would include all three meals.

Interestingly, the daily recommended calories in France is 1,500. 

The siren also showed off her dinner, which seemed to be chicken with onions and lemon with a carrot with a side of tube pasta and a red sauce as well as a plate of Bruschetta with mozzarella, tomatoes and basil dressed in balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

On Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie has been seen in the kitchen as she says, like her mom Kris Jenner, she loves making meals.

During Thanksgiving she offered her recipe for sweet potatoes that included maple syrup.

The mother to Stormi Webster does not seem to try too hard to cut calories, but she still has an enviable hourglass figure that she uses to promote her Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin companies.

New look from three years ago: This week she was seen in the music video for Tyga's 2017 song Feel Me with Kanye West. Kylie was blonde as she showed off her hot body in a bikini adding heels

Naughty: Kim came in later and there was a moment when the editing made it look as if Kim was giving birth to Kylie

Her shape could just be due to good genes or consistent workouts.

Her eating habits are in direct contrast with those of her sister Kim Kardashian who has been on the Atkins Diet, which limits carbs.

Kim, who will be 40 in October, has talked often about how hard it is to stay slender because she loves junk food like Kentucky Fried Chicken and In-N-Out as well as churros.

And sister Khloe, who was called the 'fat sister' has written an entire book on how to stay slim by cutting down on carbs.

Fiery: On Wednesday, Jenner also included this note about remember who she is

She also hits the gym every morning to look good for her shows KUWTK and Revenge Body. 

It's been a busy week for Kylie already, after she dropped into Paris for a meeting with Coty last week.
