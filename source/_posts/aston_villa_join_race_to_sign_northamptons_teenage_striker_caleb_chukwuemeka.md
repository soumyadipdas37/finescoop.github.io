Aston Villa are among the clubs interested in Northampton's teenage striker prospect Caleb Chukwuemeka.

Villa already have Chukwuemeka's highly-rated brother, England under-17 midfielder Carney, on their books, and are keen to reunite the pair.

Chukwuemeka senior, 18, is attracting interest after a prolific campaign for Northampton's under-18s last season when he scored 16 goals and also recorded 14 assists before the youth football season was curtailed.Â

Villa are at the front of the queue but Norwich and Belgian side Club Brugges are admirers of the speedy 6ft 3in Chukwuemeka too.

Chukwuemeka's contract situation has also encouraged his suitors.

He has turned down Northampton's offer of a first professional contract and now looks increasingly likely to leave the League One club.
