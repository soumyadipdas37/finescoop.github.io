Channel Nine's Millionaire Hot Seat is relocating to Queensland for seven weeks to film new episodes.

According to TV Tonight, production is moving after the show was denied access to resume filming at Docklands Studios in Melbourne following a coronavirus outbreak on its neighbouring set The Masked Singer.

The quiz show's host Eddie McGuire is believed to have arrived in Queensland and is currently in quarantine.

Nine confirmed to Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday, that filming will be commencing in Queensland.

Last month, Millionaire Hot Seat was ordered to stop filming following a coronavirus outbreak on The Masked Singer, which is located nearby.

The show is filmed at a separate studio but shared facilities with The Masked Singer at the Melbourne location. 

'Anything that wasn't already in production by midnight August 6 was not able to continue and that includes things that were on hiatus,' a Channel Nine spokesman told the Herald Sun.

The Masked Singer was rocked by an outbreak after seven dancers tested positive for coronavirus and the show's stars were ordered to self-isolate.

The COVID-19 bombshell came on the night of the show's grand final being filmed.  

One dancer came to the set ill and was told by producers to go home, the Sunday Herald Sun reported.

Another six dancers who were in close contact also reportedly tested positive.

'Production on The Masked Singer has been immediately suspended as a result of several crew members receiving a positive test result for COVID-19,' Network Ten said in a statement at the time.

'The health and safety of the community, and our staff and production partners is our number one priority.

'The entire production team, including the masked singers, the host and panellists are now in self-isolation. They are all being monitored closely and are in constant contact with medical authorities.'
