She is preparing to welcome her first child, with partner Zayn Malik, in the coming weeks. 

And Gigi Hadid reminisced on her journey to becoming a mother, as she shared throwback photos from her 27th week of pregnancy.

Gigi has spent much of her pregnancy at her mother Yolanda Hadid's farm in Pennsylvania, where her family isolated during the pandemic. 

Spending time under the bright blue and cloudy sky, she rested her hand on her growing belly that she shot from an upward angle. 

In a blue cropped top, and low-rise sweats, her rounding belly looked larger thanks to the angle. 

She added a cream colored bucket hat to her casual and comfortable ensemble as she went fresh faced.

Time flies: 'from about 27 weeks,' she marked the photos. Adding: 'time flew' 

'[F]rom about 27 weeks,' she marked the photos. Adding: 'time flew.'

The true size of her bump was more clear in another photo as she stood away from the camera, rubbing a horse on the farm. 

Gigi's post comes just a day after her father Mohamed Hadid posted a handwritten note to his soon-to-arrive grandchild. 

His post sent fans spiraling, assuming the model gave birth, though when asked if the baby had arrived he said 'no not yet.'

Overjoyed: Her post comes after the model's father Mohamed Hadid posted a tender note for his future grandchild on Instagram Wednesday, making people think the baby had arrived

Jumping the gun! But he later clarified that the family was still waiting when asked if Gigi had given birth in the comment section

Based on a photo she shared on August 31, captioned '33 weeks,' the mother-to-be is nearing the end of her pregnancy. 

It's unclear if she was 33-weeks when she shared the photos, which would make her 35-weeks now, or if she was marking when the photos were taken in late July, putting her 40-weeks currently, putting her days away from giving birth.  

The model confirmed her pregnancy in April, after 'family sources' first revealed the news she and her on/off boyfriend of boyfriend of five years were starting a family.

She said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. 

'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.'

An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month that the couple had been getting along great ahead of the birth of their baby.

'[They are] closer than ever. Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn,' the source revealed. 'She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.'

And it seems their incoming bundle of joy will be just the start for the young family. 

Back in May People said the celebrity couple 'plan to have a large family. 'They've been through their ups and downs, but neither stopped caring about the other.' 

Of expanding their brood, they went on: 'They've jumped on the timing of having a baby and are preparing for their new lives.

'Gigi is young but always said she wants several kids. She's sensitive and nurturing and will be a great mom.' 

Hadid and Malik's relationship has not always been perfect. The duo began dating in in November 2015, three months after the musician called off his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards. 

But after just over two years together, the couple confirmed their break-up on Twitter in March 2018.

The pair reconciled in December of 2019 after a year long split, during which time Gigi briefly dated former Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron.
