Lea Michele has cast a nostalgic eye back at her pregnancy by sharing a photo taken just one day before she welcomed her first child with husband Zandy Reich.

The actress gave birth son Ever Leo on August 20th, three months after the couple confirmed they were expecting a baby. 

Taking to Instagram on Thursday, Lea, 34, posted a black and white image from her pregnancy in which she is captured floating in the ocean, her baby bump protruding above the water's surface.

With her eyes closed and her arms outspread, the former Glee! star looked completely serene as she allowed the water's current to gently carry her. 

Addressing the accompanying caption to her son, she wrote: 'The day before I met you.'  

Lea married husband Zandy in Napa last March, and they announced in early May this year that she had become pregnant.

Lea's eyes were almost closed as she basked in her blissful moment with her new little pride and joy. 

The actress kept a relatively low profile throughout her pregnancy, with E! News insiders explaining 'Lea has wanted to take it easy for the first part of her pregnancy.

'She has really enjoyed being present and getting to soak in being pregnant without distractions.'

It seems like parenthood was destined for Lea and Zandy. After pregnancy news broke sources close to the couple told People: 'They’ve always wanted to be parents.'

Lea and Zandy wed in March 2019 with an intimate ceremony in Northern California.

'We are so excited to be married and grateful to be surrounded by our friends and family,' the pair told People at the time. 

'And most of all, we’re so happy to spend the rest of our lives together.'
