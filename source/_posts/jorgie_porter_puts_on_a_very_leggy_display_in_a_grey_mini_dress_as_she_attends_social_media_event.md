Jorgie Porter put on a very leggy display as she attended a social media event at Manchester's Foodwell on Thursday.

The former Hollyoaks star, 32, looked chic in a ruched grey midi dress as she arrived at the event hosted by influencer Georgia Portogall. 

Jorgie appeared in great spirits as she flashed a warm smile while making her way down the street.

The star, who played Theresa McQueen in the Channel 4 soap, paired her thigh-skimming dress with a long-line black leather jacket and slung a black bag across her body. 

While she added a casual element to her look with a chunky pair of white trainers.

The former Dancing On Ice contestant left her blonde locks loose for the occasion, while she added a sleek palette of make-up.    

Jorgie's night out comes after her decision to try and spice up her love life with a spot of virtual dating during lockdown.

In April, the former soap star admitted she had to resort to FaceTime to try and get to know possible suitors after struggling to meet someone due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She revealed she gets a lot of attention on dating apps, but wanted to try her hand at video dating while she has additional time on her hands.

Jorgie told New! magazine: 'I've had a FaceTime date. It's quite scary because you think we're just gonna sit face to face and say, "Hello, how are you?"

'It's kind of awkward, so it's good to do a creative activity like paint a picture together, which is what we did. It's cool because you see how much effort they've put in.

'So if they get their paints and canvas ready, you're like, "Ah, he wants to impress me".'
