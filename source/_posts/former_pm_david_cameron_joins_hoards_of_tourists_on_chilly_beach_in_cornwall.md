David Cameron has enjoyed another session bodyboarding in Cornwall as he relaxes on the family's annual holiday to the West Country.

Former Prime Minister David Cameron, 53, was spotted on Thursday wearing a shortie wetsuit and taking to the waves at Polzeath. 

He was carrying a white bodyboard as he strolled the beach despite the cloudy weather.

David Cameron cut a fine figure as he joined the hoards of tourists looking to get a head start on the bank holiday weekend on Polzeath Beach in Cornwall on Thursday afternoon.

This is the second time the former Prime Minister has been pictured taking on the surf off the Cornish coast.

Mr Cameron was snapped at Daymer Beach last month.

The Camerons have holidayed in Cornwall every summer since David entered Downing Street in 2010.

Their youngest child Florence was born at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro after she arrived early during their break that year.

Their favourite resort, Polzeath, is also popular among the younger members of the royal family.

Staycationers determined to make the most of the August bank holiday packed out beaches and campsites despite forecasters warning that temperatures could plummet below 10C. 

Party-goers were out in force as they celebrated the start of the long bank holiday weekend despite the wet and windy conditions.

The wettest place on Thursday was Lanreath, Cornwall, where 51mm (two inches) fell over 24 hours to 7pm, the Met Office said. Cornwall’s average rainfall for the whole of August is 81mm (3.2ins).
