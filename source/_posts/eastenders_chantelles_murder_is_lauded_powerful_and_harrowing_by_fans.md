Gray thought Chantelle was having an affair with Kheerat Panesar (Jaz Deol) after he overheard her leaving a message on the phone, trying to plan her escape. 

Kheerat's phone was dead at the time and Gray's anger reached fever pitch after Chantelle plucked up the courage to tell him she was leaving him.

Seething with rage, Gray threatened to strangle their children in front of her before he chased her around the house, leaving viewers horrified.
