Queen Latifah kept herself moving on Wednesday evening as she waited for her takeout from a West Hollywood cafe. 

The 50-year old star stretched her legs while idling on the sidewalk after calling into a local coffee shop for some refreshments. 

Latifah - real name Dana Owens - looked relaxed in a grey sweater and matching joggers as she passed the time while her order was filled.

The actress, rapper and producer added to her causal look with a pair simple black running shoes, while her hair was neatly pulled into a tight ponytail. 

In accordance with current health regulations she covered her features with a protective mask during her latest appearance in Hollywood. 

Latifah recently played Hattie McDaniel, the first Black Oscar winner for her portrayal of Mammy in Gone With the Wind, in Ryan Murphy's Netflix series Hollywood.

But she has since since condemned the classic 1939 film, and the cultural significance of McDaniel's win. 

She told Associated Press: 'They didn’t even let [McDaniel] in the theater until right before she got that award. Someone came outside and brought her into the auditorium. 

'She wasn’t even allowed to sit in there. And then she had to read a speech that was written by a studio. You know that’s not what the hell she wanted to say.'

She added: 'Then after that, all she could do was play the same kinds of roles… So the opportunities at that time and the way that those in power in that business were relegating us and marginalizing us and not allowing us to grow and thrive after that was just terrible. And a lot of that is still around today.'

Latifah is also slated to star in a gender-swapped reboot of The Equalizer on CBS, where she will portray the enigmatic Robyn McCall, who uses her considerable skills to help people in trouble.

The original series ran for four seasons on CBS from 1985 to 1989 starring Edward Woodward as Robert McCall, with Denzel Washington playing Robert Woodward in the 2014 movie adaptation The Equalizer and its 2018 sequel The Equalizer II.
