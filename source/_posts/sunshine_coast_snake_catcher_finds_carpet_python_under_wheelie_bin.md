A veteran snake catcher has been left stunned after discovering a giant curled-up carpet python concealed underneath a suburban garden bin. 

The python was found under a green wheelie bin by Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers wrangler Stuart McKenzie - who said the serpent was 'double the size of what I was thinking'.

The snake catcher warned homeowners to be wary of a small gap underneath their backyard bins, but said even he was shocked to discover the actual size of the python at a home in the Sunshine Coast suburb of Nambour.

'Holy! Look at the size of it! That is double the size of what I was thinking,' he said in footage filmed in the home's courtyard.

You'll never want to take the trash out again: 'Holy! Look at the size of it! That is double the size of what I was thinking,' Mr McKenzie said in footage filmed in the home's courtyard

Mr McKenzie brought a pillow case with him in the hope of using it to snare the python but knew it would be insufficient for the task once he discovered the task at hand.

Despite him holding up the snake to reveal it was even longer than him, the resident who first made the discovery said she 'wasn't even frightened' of the huge animal.

'This is one of the biggest carpet pythons I've caught in years! As you can tell, I was pretty stoked,' Mr McKenzie wrote as he shared his find on the Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 Facebook page.

'He was taken a good distance away [from the home] to live a longer life and hopefully not scare anymore old ladies!'

'I’m going to be terrified taking the bins out from now on,' one social media user wrote in response to the video.

'Absolutely beautiful! I can’t believe that snake fit under the wheelie bin,' another wrote.

The clip has been shared almost 7,500 times and has more than 6,700 likes since first being posted on Monday.

Although carpet pythons are non-venomous to humans, their bite can still cause significant damage including severe punctures and lacerations.

The Queensland snake catcher on Monday issued a warning to the public after capturing a huge red belly after it slithered through a school.

Mr McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia he had seen a number of large adult snakes on the move through the Sunshine Coast region.

'It's been hectic,' Mr McKenzie said. 'It's that time of year. All the big adult snakes are out and about and mating and all the boys are fighting each other.'

Mr McKenzie was called to relocate an enormous red belly black snake on Friday after it snuck its way through the playground to the back of a school. 

'It was very big for a red belly,' he said. 'A good four-and-a-half to five foot and fat and chunky.

'The teachers did a great job of keeping the kids away.'

Mr McKenzie estimated the snake was around eight-years-old and among a wealth of elder snakes travelling about on the Sunshine Coast lately.

'Everyone's coming out to play,' he said.
