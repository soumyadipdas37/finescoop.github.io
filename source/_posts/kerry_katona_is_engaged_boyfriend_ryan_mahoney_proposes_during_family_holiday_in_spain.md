In pictures obtained by OK! Online, personal trainer Ryan can be seen down on one knee as he surprised Kerry during her early 40th birthday celebrations in Spain. 


A source close to the pair told the publication: 'Ryan is really close to all of Kerry's kids so he made sure he involved them before asking for Kerry's hand in marriage.


'He got Kerry a massive two carat diamond ring and showed it to the girls first and they all loved it.' 


The source explained that Kerry was speechless after being proposed to on the roof of Silverfield villa in Granada, Spain and took a while to say yes while Ryan waited with a 'massive grin' on his face.

'Because they'd all been celebrating Kerry's birthday it was the perfect party for the engagement too. There was a chef cooking them food and even a DJ playing music too.'


To make things extra special, Kerry's kids had laid out rose petals on the floor ahead of Ryan's proposal.  


MailOnline has contacted Kerry Katona's representatives for comment. 


Loved-up: Back in June, Kerry praised Ryan for being 'the most normal relationship she's ever had and revealed she wanted him to propose


She said of Ryan in June: 'He's dedicated, determined and loyal and he's been an incredible father figure to my kids' (above with daughters Heidi and Dylan Jorge)


Kerry shares children Molly, 18, and Lilly-Sue, 17, with Westlife star ex-husband Brian McFadden. 


The singer also has Heidi, 13, and Maxwell, 12, with ex-husband Mark Croft and Dylan-Jorge, six, with late ex-husband George Kay.

Speaking to New! Magazine, the ex Atomic Kitten star gushed about her love for Ryan saying: 'I can't see my life with anyone else, I trust him implicitly.' 


'He's dedicated, determined and loyal and he's been an incredible father figure to my kids.


She added, at the time: 'I've been looking at Cartier rings and I've even called up enquiring about one.'  


Back in the day: Kerry, pictured in March 2003, first found love with Westlife's Brian McFadden, but they divorced in 2006 after four years of marriage

Short-lived: In 2005, the star then struck up a volatile relationship with Dave Cunningham, calling off their short-lived engagement following a huge fight in Spain (Pictured in 2005)


Kerry and Ryan originally started dating in June 2018 but split in October 2018 after just four months of dating, following their 'make or break' trip to Thailand. 


They rekindled their romance in summer 2019. Writing in her column for new! magazine last year, the mother-of-five, branded the hunk a 'godsend' after her ex-husband George died in an abrupt, drug-related death in a Holiday Inn on July 6 at the age of 39.    


She also insisted the on-off couple were trying to keep their relationship out of the spotlight.


Throwback: The singer also has Heidi, 13, and Maxwell, 12, with ex-husband Mark Croft (Pictured in 2008)


Kerry said: 'He's been a good friend to me and over the last few months we just decided to give it a go.


'He's been a godsend recently when I've needed him most. We're settled, committed, my kids love him and so do I.


'In my mind, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.


'So this time I'm finally dating a man who has a job, his own money, and is very happy to stay out of the media.'

While Kerry Katona has much to celebrate with the joyous news that she's taking another trip down the aisle, her road to romantic bliss has been quite the rocky one. The Warrington native has already made three trips down the aisle, with each marriage coming to a tumultuous end. And with a handful of relationships in between, it's fair to say that the star now deserves her shot at happily ever after. Below is a list of the star's marriages and relationships. 


 


BRIAN McFADDEN (1999-2004)





It was a match made in pop heaven when Kerry and BrianMcFadden met while their respective bands, Atomic Kitten and Westlife, toured together in 1999. Such a whirlwind was their romance that Brian proposed within three months of the pair getting together and they welcomed their daughter Molly in 2001. A lavish celebrity wedding followed in 2002, and a year later, they welcomed their second daughter, Lily-Sue.  But, alas, it wasn't meant to be, as in 2004 the couple announced their separation amid allegations Brian had cheated on Kerry with a lapdancer. Heartbroken Kerry was granted a quickie divorce.


 


DAN CORSI (2004)





Kerry very briefly got back together with her ex, Dan Corsi, who she first dated in 1998. During their time together, they visited Kerry's native Warrington and were also seen partying up a storm at London hotspot-of-the-moment Pangaea. Dan boasted about bedding the star, saying: 'Spending the night with Kerry was all I hoped it would be. I thought she'd find it hard to be with someone else after being with Brian for five years, but it felt natural.' However, friends reportedly feared that Dan was just cashing in on Kerry's fame, amid reports he still lived with his ex, while simultaneously texting another former flame.  It took just six weeks of rekindled romance before Kerry, feeling that it was too soon after the breakdown of her marriage to embark on another relationship, reportedly dumped Dan over the phone. Surprisingly, her ex-husband Brian publicly shared his opinions on Dan, telling The Mirror at the time: 'I've known him for a while and I know he's not the one for her. I don't want her to get hurt. Despite everything that's gone on, I just want her to be happy.'


 


DAVE CUNNINGHAM (2005)





In huge contrast to her glitzy showbiz marriage, Kerry embarked on a romance with her former childhood sweetheart, Dave Cunningham, with the couple announcing their engagement in 2005. However, it wasn't long before their relationship hit the rocks, with the pair getting into a furious row while holidaying in Spain, amid rumours Dave had been seeing his ex-girlfriend behind her back. A source told People at the time: 'Kerry is devastated. After everything she has gone through this year she truly believed Dave could be her saviour. Then the shocking revelations about his ex emerged.'


 


MARK CROFT (2005-2010)





Six weeks after her split, Kerry was swept off her feet by taxi driver Mark Croft. He proposed in 2006 after just six weeks of dating, and they tied the knot on Valentine's Day 2007. Their marriage produced two children: daughter Heidi and son Maxwell. However, the union came about during a tumultuous time in Kerry's life, as she watched her fortune (which once peaked at £6.8million) dwindle to the point that she was declared bankrupt. During her marriage, she also made her infamous appearance on ITV's This Morning, where her slurred speech prompted concern among viewers. She ultimately admitted to a cocaine addiction, as she confessed: 'I hated my life. I'd lie in bed for three days in a row doing cocaine with Mark. We did coke in our en suite and had a lock on the door. The kids knew if the bathroom door was locked they mustn't come in.' After having even considered suicide during their marriage, the couple split in 2010. Mark would later admit that he 'bled Kerry dry' during their ill-fated relationship.


 


GEORGE KAY (2012-2017)





It appeared that a change of fortune was on the cards for Kerry 2012, when she met George Kay, who at the time was working as her driver. Sparks flew between the pair, prompting former rugby player George to pop the question at the top of Blackpool Tower in April 2013. exactly one year later, more joy was brought into their home when Kerry gave birth to their daughter Dylan-Jorge. A trip down the aisle followed in September 2014, and it seemed that Kerry had finally found the elusive One. But trouble entered their relationship just two months after the wedding, when George was hospitalised after showing 'signs of a stroke', leaving Kerry struggling to cope. Her struggles in dealing with George's behaviour led to the couple splitting, though they would eventually get back together and renew their wedding vows. However, things would eventually come to a complete end in 2017, amid accusations of domestic violence on George's part. But the heartbreak didn't end there, as in July 2019, George unexpectedly passed away aged 39.





JAMES ENGLISH  (2017)





It took just weeks for the star to embark on a new relationship following her spit from George. Showing she was a woman of the times, Kerry went Instagram official with her handsome new boyfriend James English in 2017. And while the numerous posts of herself spending time with the Scottish comedian were shared on social media, the pair soon quietly went their separate ways within just two months. In fact, their split was so quiet that it wasn't noticed until the star spoke about being a singleton once again.
