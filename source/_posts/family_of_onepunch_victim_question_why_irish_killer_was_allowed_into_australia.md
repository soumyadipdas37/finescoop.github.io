Patrick Farrell spent three years in jail for the violent death of 20-year-old student Andrew Dolon in his hometown of Kildare in Ireland in 2011

The parents of a one-punch victim have asked why their son's killer was allowed into Australia as the Irish thug stands accused of almost slicing a man's ear off in Sydney.

Patrick Farrell spent three years in jail for manslaughter over the violent death of 20-year-old student Andrew Dolon in his hometown of Kildare in Ireland in 2011.

The 29-year-old is now wanted by police in New South Wales following two vicious alleged attacks in Sydney's eastern suburbs in August 2020 and November 2019.

Upon hearing about Farrell's latest alleged assaults, Mr Dolan's father Joe was horrified.

'We are shocked and appalled, these allegations are very serious,' he told The Daily Telegraph from his home in Ireland.

'We wonder how he got to Australia in the first place and hope that justice will be delivered appropriately.'

His son, a young biomedical student, pleaded for his life before Farrell delivered the fatal blow. 

'Don't hit me,' Mr Dolan begged on December 23, 2011. 'What did I do?'

He died in hospital ten days later.

Farrell, then 21, pleaded guilty to the unlawful killing.

In campaigns to end one-punch violence, Mr Dolan's mother Rosie said that if bystanders had intervened, her son may still be alive.

According to the Australian Department of Home Affairs' website, all visa applicants have criminal record checks.

It also says that anyone who has had a jail sentence of more than one year is banned from entering Australia.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton's office told the publication it could not comment on individual cases.

'The Australian Government takes seriously its responsibility to protect the Australian public from the risk of harm posed by non-citizens who engage in criminal conduct or behaviour,' the statement said. 

It also said: 'Non-citizens who do not comply with their visa conditions, who provide incorrect information in order to enter Australia ... or who engage in substantial criminal conduct will have their visas cancelled'.
