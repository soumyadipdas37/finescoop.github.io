Larsa and Scottie were married from 1997 until their tumultuous divorce in 2018.

The former couple, who appear to be amicable terms, share four children, sons Scotty, 19, Preston, 18, and Justin, 15, and daughter Sophia, 12.

'I was married to him for 20 years, I did everything for him and my family. People change and that's what really happened,' explained Larsa to TMZ, after allegations of cheating began to surface online.

Larsa had a rumored fall out with the Kardashian family earlier this year. Kourtney and Khloe unfollowed Larsa on Instagram amid the ongoing fallout from Kanye West's Twitter meltdown.

The dramatic unfollowing was seemingly prompted after the rapper, 43, cryptically Tweeted: 'Larsa' along with a thinking face emoji, followed by the question: 'Should I name more?'

A search of the reality TV sisters' Instagram accounts shows neither of them – or sister Kim – follow the wife of NBA legend Scottie Pippen.

Larsa appeared to respond by unfollowing the famous sisters, including her BFF Kim, and the following morning appeared to address the rumours as she shared a post in which she revealed she was 'praying that everybody finds peace'.
