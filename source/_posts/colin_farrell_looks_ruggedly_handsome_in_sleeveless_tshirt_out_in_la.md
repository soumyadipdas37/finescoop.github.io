Colin Farrell is getting ready to head back to England to finish shooting The Batman, with Robert Pattinson in the titular role of the Dark Knight, in England in early September. 

While in quarantine in Los Angeles in recent months, the Irish-born actor, who plays Penguin in Matt Reeves' superhero reboot, has been working out hard in order to keep in shape.

And all that work was on display when Farrell showed off his toned biceps while waiting to pick up some lunch to-go in the trendy Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles on Monday.

He also wore a pair of tan shoes and a bandana over his short brown hair on another warm and sunny Southern California day. 

In adherence to health and safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Farrell donned a black protective while out in public.

While waiting for his food, Farrell cooled off with an ice-cold soda, and eventually he was on his way.

A lot of fans are still talking about Farrell's incredible transformation into the villainous Penguin in the first official trailer for The Batman just over a week ago.

He looked unrecognizable, compliments of the top-notch prosthetics and makeup work, in his three brief appearances in the two-minute-plus teaser.

The actor has gone on record to say how much 'fun' he's had creating the new version of Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin, and to understand 'the aesthetic of the character,' during an interview with GMA Online News in May.

Back to work: Production on The Batman is expected to pick back up in the UK in early September, according to a report in Variety

Farrell's role as Penguin is said to be a minor one, but nonetheless, he expressed how excited he is to get back to the set and 'explore it,' according to Variety.  

Director Matt Reeves recently revealed he only shot about 25% of the film before the  mass closures of movie and TV sets in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

Along with Pattinson and Farrell, The Batman also stars Jeffrey Wright as Gotham Police Department commissioner James Gordon; John Turturro as Carmine Falcone; Peter Sarsgaard as Gotham D.A. Gil Colson; Zoe Kravitiz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman; Paul Dano as Edward Nashton/Riddler; Barry Keoghan as Stanley Merkel; Jayme Lawson as mayoral candidate Bella Reál; and Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth. 

The Batman is slated to hit theaters an October 1, 2021.
