The new Premier League season is fast approaching and clubs are working around the clock to bolster their squads before another long campaign.

Real Madrid are reportedly prepared to pay half of Gareth Bale's wages to get him off their wage bill, while Manchester United are continuing talks with Borussia Dortmund over Jadon Sancho's transfer fee.  

Here, Sportsmail's Jack Kinnersley will provide live updates from the Premier League and European clubs as they continue to negotiate and complete signings during this window.

Have a good evening! Thank you for tuning in and reading Sportsmail's live transfer blog. We will back here again tomorrow at 8am so make sure you return!

In the long-term, Arteta is looking to deploy his team in a 4-3-3 formation and the recruitment of the Frenchman is paramount if those plans are to be realised.

The Gunners are determined to sign the 22-year-old this summer, but do not have the resources to fund a deal worth 60 million euros (£55.4m).

Rennes were looking for a £23million fee but it appears that they have met around the £20m mark. 

Should Mendy complete his move to Stamford Bridge, Kepa Arrizabalaga's future will be called into question following his frustrating season for the Blues.

Mourinho is desperate to strengthen his armoury in attack and provide back up for Harry Kane, who scored 18 goals last season. 

Although, the 57-year-old Tottenham boss did admit that the club are not in a position to 'go into the market and spend a fortune on players.'   

Madrid, like most of top European sides, have seen their finances trimmed this year due to losses inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.

But the Spanish giants have drawn up a methodical battle plan which sees their key targets available to sign in one fell swoop next summer, according to AS in Spain.

Liverpool have until October 5 to conclude any summer business, after which point the transfer window will officially close.

The Reds have already completed the £11.75m signing of Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos, though are still understood to be in the market for central defensive cover.

Patkson Daka's current deal expires in 2024, meaning a lucrative offer would be required to lure the striker away from the Red Bull Arena. 

He had forged a potent partnership with Erling Haaland before the Norwegian moved to Borussia Dortmund, and it is unlikely Salzburg will be prepared to sell their leading marksman for the second window in succession. 

Leno, who featured for Germany against Switzerland last weekend, is poised to start the season as Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper and is set to feature away to Fulham on Saturday.

Martinez joined Arsenal as a youngster in 2010 and had to be extremely patient for opportunities to impress as he was sent out on loan on six occasions.

The former Arsenal star joined the club in 2018 as a free agent on a lucrative three-year contract, but injuries have limited hiim to just 18 appearances.

Wilshere admitted earlier this year that his time at West Ham has been unsuccessful.

He was expected to meet Juventus directors to discuss details of terminating Higuain's £6.3million contract by mutual consent.

Now those talks appear to have been concluded, Higuain is set to link up with David Beckham at his new MLS franchise Inter Miami.

The Catalan giants are looking to add at least three names to their squad this summer - namely a left-footed centre-back, a physical midfielder and a forward - after resolving the transfer saga involving star man Lionel Messi last month.

But the club acknowledge they must urgently address their overly-inflated wage bill and Mundo Deportivo claim 12 players are yet to clarify their future with the crisis-struck club.

Giroud has also been identified as a potential target but no formal offer has been made by the Italian club.  

The 33-year-old signed an extension to his Blues contract in May which will cover the entirety of the 2020-21 season, however this has not deterred interested clubs. 

Wilshere joined the club in 2018 as a free agent on a three-year contract worth around £100,000 a week. In an injury-plagued spell he has made just 18 appearances and scored one goal.

The former Arsenal star admitted earlier this year that his time at West Ham has not worked out.

The 21-year-old French midfielder was accused of taunting his opponents over their wages. Though he escaped FA punishment for the fracas, he didn't play again for the remainder of Arsenal's season.

He was also left out of the FA Cup holders' victory over Liverpool in the FA Community Shield at Wembley.

Eduardo Camavinga started 24 Ligue 1 matches last season as he helped his side overachieve and claim a Champions League qualification spot. 

More significantly however, Camavinga was handed his senior France debut last week, when he featured against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. 

Wolves, who have already had a £15million offer for Maitland-Niles rejected, are understood to be preparing an improved bid.

Maitland-Niles has a strong emotional attachment to the Gunners, who he joined as a six-year-old.

Chelsea are well stocked in midfield themselves and would like to add a younger holding player with West Ham's Declan Rice and Lille's Boubakary Soumare among those fancied by Frank Lampard.

Jorginho, 28, is considered more expendable and, after their outlay this summer, Lampard recognises the club have to consider ways of balancing the books.

Today could be another huge day in the transfer window with so many big deals still be done. Stay tuned right here so you know all the latest news first.
