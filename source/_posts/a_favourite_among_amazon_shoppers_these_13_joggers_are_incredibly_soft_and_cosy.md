Planning on spending more time at home in the next few weeks? Then you should probably stock up on some comfortable loungewear.

Whether you're looking for oversized hoodies, women's loungewear sets or comfy tracksuit bottoms, Amazon has got you covered.

If joggers are on your list, it's worthing checking out these Aibrou Women's Jogger Pants, which one Amazon shopper called 'comfortable and cool'.

These Aibrou Women's Jogger Pants are a favourite among Amazon shoppers thanks to their soft and comfortable design

Made from an ultra-soft and lightweight cotton, the £12.99 joggers are tapered, have an elastic drawstring waistband and pockets, and feature contrasting white stripes down the sides.

And while the comfy bottoms are ideal for wearing at home, they are also cute enough to wear outside the house too, whether you're hitting the gym or running errands. Pair them with a white tee and trainers for the ultimate 90s cool-girl look.

They have a near-perfect average star rating from over 1,100 shoppers who praise the Aibrou Womens Jogger Pants, describing them as 'the best joggers ever'. It's no surprise they rank highly in Amazon's Women's Sports Trousers category.

'Comfiest tracksuit bottoms ever bought!' raved one shopper. 'Was a bit worried about sizing but I'm a ten and a medium fits perfectly!'

'These are the most comfortable joggers ever,' said another. 'I live in them. I got a size bigger as I wear them around the house and for the gym. Comfort meets practicality.'

A third shopper added: 'Lovely and breathable, I am a very small woman 5ft too about 5'2 and I need a medium as I have a wide waist, but the trouble is the leg was rather long. 

'But I basically live in them now as they are so comfy and are practical because of their deep pockets!'

The popular joggers are machine washable at 40 degrees and ranges in size from S to XXL. And they won't break the bank either as they cost as little as £12.99 depending on the size and colour you select.
