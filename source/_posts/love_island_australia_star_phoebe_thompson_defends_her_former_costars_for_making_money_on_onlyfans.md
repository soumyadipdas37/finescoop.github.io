Love Island Australia star Phoebe Thompson has defended women using OnlyFans as a means to generate income.

Making her views on the matter known in a post shared to her Instagram on Sunday, the credit analyst stated that the 's**t-shaming' that women experienced while on the adult streaming platform was a result of internalised misogyny.

The 28-year-old added that people weren't merely angry because of the nudity, but in a woman's ability to 'make choices about her own body.'

OnlyFans is a subscription-based website where followers can view everything from conservative photos to sexually explicit videos.

While Phoebe isn't using OnlyFans herself, three of her previous Love Island castmates - Shelby Bilby, Edyn Mackney and Vanessa Sierra - are seeing incredible success on the platform.

And Phoebe made it clear that she was in full support of their decisions to make money on OnlyFans.

Phoebe began her lengthy Instagram message by saying: ' Shout out to all the women doing OF making bank!!!! The s**t shaming and judgement you receive is mostly from insecure men and women with internalised misogyny.

She added: 'TRUTH is that people don’t like to see women capitalising of their sexuality/ body!! 

'The anger is not in nudity but in women taking back the power to make choices about their own bodies whilst independently using a platform to earn more money than you....

'Just a reminder that different women feel empowered by different things!!! Whether you’re working a pole, wearing scrubs, raising children, dominating a court room, a CEO or a h**, you all bad a** hustlers,' she ended.

Phoebe rose to fame as a contestant on season two of Love Island Australia.

She entered the villa on Day 4 of the show, but she was dumped from the island on Day 12.

The reality star made Love Island Australia history by coupling up with co-star Cassie Lansdell and becoming the first same-sex couple.
