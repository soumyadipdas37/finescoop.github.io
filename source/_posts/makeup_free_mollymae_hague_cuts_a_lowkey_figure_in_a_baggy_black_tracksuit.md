Molly-Mae Hague was spotted stepping out in Cheshire for the first time since it was claimed she had 'hippy crack' paraphernalia in her home. 

The Love Island star, 21, was going for a more pared-back look than usual on Friday as she stepped out in a tracksuit while going make-up free. 

Her outing came as fans called her out after they spotted what looked like 'hippy crack' laughing gas canisters in her flat as she filmed a video for YouTube .

Uh oh: Molly-Mae Hague was spotted stepping out in Cheshire for the first time since it was claimed she had 'hippy crack' paraphernalia in her home

Molly-Mae wore a baggy muted ensemble while wearing her hair in loose lengths with half pulled up in a ponytail off her face.

She looked fresh-faced as she emerged in the baggy tracksuit with designer trainers as she made sure she put comfort first.  

Her outing comes days after she filmed a clip in her Cheshire flat as she spent the evening with her boyfriend Tommy Fury and their pal Maura Higgins.

While watching the video which was called My Wardrobe Transformation, eagle-eyed viewers noticed the box of canisters on her living room coffee table.

During the video, Molly-Mae showed her fans around her home after making a spaghetti bolognese for Tommy and Maura, before revealing they were settling down to watch a film together.

As she brought the dinner over, she said: 'Spag bol, Tommy, and Bridesmaids,' referencing the movie on the TV.

However viewers noted the box of what looked like 'hippy crack' canisters on the table and the orange balloon which was lay next to Tommy.

Many of Molly-Mae's fans took to the comments section after noticing the box, with one person writing: 'Anyone else seeing the loons box when Maura is eating the pasta and the orange balloon on the sofa.' 

Molly's rep had no comment when contacted by MailOnline. A source close to Molly insisted she had 'never done balloons', according to the Sun.

Reaction: Many of Molly-Mae's fans took to the comments section after noticing the box

Maura and Tommy's representatives have been contacted for comment. 

A source close to Maura told MailOnline: 'Maura was unaware that these were in the flat, she was just a guest at Molly and Tommy’s chilling out and enjoying dinner.'

This isn't the first time that Tommy has been associated with the so-called drug 'hippy crack'.

The boxer was allegedly filmed appearing to inhale it from a balloon before his appearance on Love Island in 2019.

In a video obtained by The Sun, the brother of boxer Tyson Fury was seen lying shirtless on the floor, seemingly having a reaction to the drug.

The video, which the website claims was filmed two months before he entered the ITV2 show, appeared to have been shot inside a friend's house, where Tommy rolls around on the carpet.

Others featured in the video with Tommy and are also seen inhaling from balloons.  

MailOnline contacted Tommy's rep and a rep at Love Island for comment at the time.
