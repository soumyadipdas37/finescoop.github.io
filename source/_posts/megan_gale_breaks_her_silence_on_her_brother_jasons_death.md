Megan Gale has broken her silence on her brother Jason Gale's death in July.

With tough border restriction rules amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Melbourne-based model, 45, revealed in an Instagram video on Monday that she knew she 'would regret not going' to his funeral held in Perth.

Mr Gale, 49, was last seen at a petrol station on July 14 in Western Australia, and was found dead a week later in bushland next to his 1999 Honda CR-V SUV.

Ms Gale joined mourners on August 18 to farewell her brother at his funeral, four weeks after he was found dead in bushland. 

She flew from Melbourne to Perth, where she completed two weeks of hotel quarantine, and travelled to Fremantle Cemetery for his cremation service.   

In her Instagram video on Monday, Ms Gale said she 'weighed up' whether to stay in Melbourne and seek the comfort of her immediate family, or fly to Perth and play her part in sending her brother off. 

Ms Gale and her AFL star fiancé Shaun Hampson, 32, share six-year-old son River and two-year-old daughter Rosie. 

The supermodel said she 'weighed up' whether to stay in Melbourne and seek the comfort of her immediate family, or fly to Perth and play her part in sending her brother off 

'I had to weigh that up. Part of me wanted to stay in Melbourne and be with my kids and my man at that time when I needed comfort more than any other time in my life.

'But I also wanted to be in Perth to support my mum, my brother and the rest of my family, and play a part in sending my brother off and putting him to rest,' she said. 

Ms Gale also revealed her concerns about drawing 'more media attention' to her brother's tragic death, by her attending.

Ms Gale also also revealed her concerns about drawing 'more media attention' to her brother's tragic death, by her attending. Despite her initial concerns, she knew she would regret not attending 

'I also knew by going to Perth that I would be responsible for risking there being more media attention and more focus on it, which I didn't want to do.

'I felt bad enough as it was. I'd been the cause of that,' she continued. 

Despite her initial concerns, she knew she would regret not attending the funeral.

'I couldn't bear the thought I knew I'd regret not going. I knew I'd regret not being there for my mum and my brother, so I went, "Okay, I'm just going to have to suck [it] up whatever that is for me, to be there".'

Mr Gale was last seen on July 14 buying petrol and water at the Popanyinning General Store, 160km south-east from his Perth home. 

Following a desperate week-long search by family, friends and police, he was found dead next to his car. 

The death was not considered suspicious.
