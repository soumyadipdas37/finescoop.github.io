Her show The Good Place narrowly missed out on scooping the Outstanding Comedy Series prize at the Emmys earlier this month.

But Jameela Jamil proved there's no rest for the wicked as she took part in a photoshoot in Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon.

The actress, 34, mixed style with comfort as she teamed a white suit with relaxed trainers while posing by a hot dog cart.

Nailing androgynous chic, the screen star looked typically chic in the longline blazer and matching ankle-grazing trousers.



The former T4 presenter added a pop of colour to her look with her signature red lipstick, while her fringed tresses were worn in light waves. 



Another look saw the brunette slip into a baggy maxi dress and a trench coat as she stood by a yellow taxi.

Jameela's appearance came after she said surviving her suicide attempt seven years ago has proved to be 'the most extraordinary gift'.

The media personality took to Instagram to mark World Suicide Prevention Day, expressing her joy at having survived, while she gushed about the things in her life she now gets to enjoy – including her romance with James Blake.

Nothing that she can now help others, she wrote: 'Surviving suicide has been the most extraordinary gift to me in being able to still be here and remind the people I love that sometimes it's just a particularly overwhelming hour, day, week or month.

'And that it can and normally will pass, and that with even small incremental changes and reaching out to even just one person for help, life really can get better. Please hang on. #suicidepreventionday.'

The British beauty also shared a black-and-white snap of herself posing with her 31-year-old musician beau James and their beloved pet pooch. 

Stressing her happiness in the photo, the presenter-turned-thespian added to the snap: 'I have everything I need.'

She further captioned the heartwarming image: 'Glad I stuck around in the end. Got to meet my two Favourite lads. #suicidepreventionday.'

In 2019, Jameela revealed that she had attempted her own life six years prior, noting that she was 'lucky' to be alive.

She wrote on Twitter at the time: 'Today is #WorldMentalHealthDay. This month, six years ago, I tried to take my own life. I’m so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD.'

'I think I had one executive producer who was a south Asian woman and she was fantastic and a massive part of why I was even able to start my career in television, because she rallied for me. Otherwise I may well have been replaced with another white person.

'Even just having her there made such a difference to my career - we as minorities do not feel safe in a room where we do not recognise ourselves, where we do not feel like anyone in that room has our shared experience. 

'And so you know I think it's really systemic on the inside where people are just casting people who look like themselves, or whose stories that they can relate to and therefore we're denying ourselves so much colour and so many interesting and diverse stories.'
