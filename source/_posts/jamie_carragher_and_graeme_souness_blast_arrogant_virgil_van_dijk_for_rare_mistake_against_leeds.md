Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has been heavily criticised for his uncharacteristic error against Leeds on the opening day of the new season.

The usually-reliable 29-year-old was punished for a loose touch on the edge of the hosts' penalty area, and Leeds ace Patrick Bamford capitalised ruthlessly to score the equaliser in the thriller at Anfield.

Former Reds stalwart Jamie Carragher was left particularly frustrated and even sensationally labelled Van Dijk as 'arrogant'.

Premier League newcomers Leeds threatened to break down Liverpool on several occasions in the opening 45 minutes, with Jack Harrison splitting their backline after a dash from the left flank to score.

Salah had opened the scoring from the penalty spot, although there was a further twist at the home of the champions when Van Dijk failed to deal with a lofted ball over the top.

And Carragher, on co-commentary duties for Sky Sports, didn't hold back when lashing out at the towering Dutchman.

He said: 'It's a brilliant game. I said hopefully after 17 minutes we'd get 90 minutes of this. This could be 7-7 at the end of the game.

'Alisson is not happy, he gets between the centre-backs there. Virgil van Dijk, that's just too arrogant.'

Van Dijk headed Liverpool back in front on 20 minutes from Andy Robertson's corner, but was caught out at the other end in jaw-dropping fashion. 

Graeme Souness echoed Carragher's scathing opinion, saying: 'Van Dijk has had an absolute stinker but he gets his goal here.'

A fascinating statistic from OptaJoe has highlighted a stark drop in Van Dijk's form in recent matches for Liverpool. 

The former Celtic and Southampton man has now made two errors directly leading to goals in his last four top flight appearances, which is more than he committed in his first 154 showings in the league.

Salah's second of the game, a thunderbolt after Leeds failed to deal with a scramble inside the box, spared Van Dijk's blushes and helped Liverpool enter the break with a narrow lead.
