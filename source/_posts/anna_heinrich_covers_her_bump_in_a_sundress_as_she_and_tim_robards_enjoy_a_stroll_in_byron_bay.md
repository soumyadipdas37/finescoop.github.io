They've been enjoying a sun-soaked babymoon in Byron Bay, New South Wales ahead of welcoming a baby girl in November.

And The Bachelor's Anna Heinrich, 33, and Tim Robards, 37, appeared thoroughly relaxed as they enjoyed a stroll through the laid-back coastal town on Monday. 

Having just returned from a day at the beach, the pair were seen walking to the popular Bayleaf cafe for lunch.

Criminal lawyer Anna covered her bourgeoning bump beneath a floaty black sundress, which she accessorised with a trendy white handbag.  

Wearing minimal makeup and allowing her blonde locks to fall loosely, the expectant mother topped off the look with white sneakers and a pair of dark sunglasses.   

Elsewhere, barefoot Tim showcased his Adonis physique by going shirtless, while making sure to cover his shoulders from the sun with beach towel.

The couple's extended stay in Byron Bay has sparked rumours they are planning a semi-permanent move to the town beloved by some of Hollywood's biggest stars. 

However, Anna hinted on Instagram last month that the relocation was only temporary.

'Getting out of Sydney is a luxury these days and I’m certainly not taking it for granted. Good to finally spend time with my hubby,' she wrote.

In January, Anna told The Daily Telegraph that the couple are hoping to have more than one child.

'It has always been on our mind but we are getting older, not that we are old but we want to have hopefully more than one kid,' she said. 

'It is something we are both very keen on.'
