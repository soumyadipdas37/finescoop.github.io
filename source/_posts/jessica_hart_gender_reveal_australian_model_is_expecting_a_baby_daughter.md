Australian model Jessica Hart and her NASCAR driver boyfriend James Kirkham have revealed they are expecting a daughter.

On Thursday, the 34-year old shared a video to Instagram of their gender reveal, which consisted of a high-octane burnout on a Los Angeles street. 

Jessica and James gave a friend an envelope with the baby's gender, as well as two bags of coloured powder - pink and blue - to place under the car's tyres.

After the correct bag was placed under the tyres, James then got into the driver's seat while Jess and her sister Ashley waited in front of the car as they called their mother, who lives in Australia, over FaceTime.

After James revved the engine, a cloud of pink dust burst from behind the car and the sisters cheered in excitement.

Jessica told People on Thursday: 'We're so beyond excited.' 

'I really thought it was going to be a boy! I don't know why. I just saw myself as a mom of boys. You just never know. I couldn't imagine it any other way now!'

Earlier this month, Jessica announced she was expecting her first child with James.

'James and I are officially pregnant,' she wrote on Instagram, alongside an image of herself holding up the results of an at-home pregnancy test. 

She continued: 'We're so super duper excited about this awesome news, especially at this time and amongst the mainly bleak news out there. What a blessing. We're so unbelievably grateful and happy!'

The blonde bombshell also shared her concerns about other mothers less fortunate than herself.

'It makes me think deeply about all the other mothers to-be out there at the moment that are struggling with access to doctors and healthcare at this time,' she wrote. 

Jessica then threw her support behind the organisation Every Mother Counts, which was founded by model Christy Turlington Burns in 2010, following the release of her documentary film No Woman, No Cry.

'I'd really love if everyone can JOIN ME in donating... Anything you can give really helps. This beautiful organisation helps pregnant woman in need. I couldn't imagine going through this without some support,' she wrote.

Jessica and James were first spotted together on Valentine's Day in 2019, when they headed out for dinner in Los Angeles. They made their romance official shortly afterwards.

In August 2019, Jessica revealed she was relocating to LA from New York to live with her 'supportive boyfriend'.
