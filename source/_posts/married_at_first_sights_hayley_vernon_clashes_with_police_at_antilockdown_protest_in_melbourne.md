Married At First Sight star Hayley Vernon clashed with police at an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne on Saturday.

She joined more than 1,000 anti-lockdown activists at the 'Freedom Day' rally to protest Daniel Andrew's Stage Four lockdown laws. 

According to posts on her Instagram account, the 33-year-old was out getting her daily exercise when she decided to join the protest.

'It's Saturday, I'm just walking down St Kilda road which is in my 5km radius,' she explained in a video.

'We're getting our one hour exercise today,' she continued. 'We thought we'd walk past the Shrine [of Remembrance] and see what's going on, so this should be interested.'

She added: 'Maybe lend our support if people need it.'

Vernon has previously shared conspiracy theories about COVID-19 on her Instagram page.

In a post on Tuesday, she urged her followers to attend the anti-lockdown protest.

'I'm calling on all activists, SJW's [social justice warriors], BLM protestors, pro-life choices, concerned Victorians, anyone! Join the walk in protesting our freedom,' she wrote.

'In this together Melbourne,' she added in another reminder post for the protest. 

Hayley - who joined the explicit adult streaming site OnlyFans last month - has been regularly accused of spreading misleading and false information about COVID-19 since it was declared a pandemic in March.

In July, she criticised Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for making face masks mandatory in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.

'Why are we wearing masks? Us people who are healthy,' she wrote on Instagram. 'This as you said "is about curbing behaviour". I'll be dammed if you are going to curb anything about me.'

She continued: 'You are a walking talking oxymoron. I am woke. I will not be wearing a mask. MELBOURNE AND AUSTRALIANS STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS. This is not the time to comply.'

Victoria recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths on Saturday, with the welcome infection numbers coming after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.

Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 59 deaths announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.
