With just under two weeks until the international transfer window closes on October 5, clubs across Europe are looking to bring in flesh blood as the 2020-21 season starts to get going.

Tottenham, who signed Gareth Bale on loan and Sergio Reguilon permanently from Real Madrid last week, are still searching for new acquisitions and are rumoured to be meeting Arkadiusz's Milik's agent in London today... could that attacking signature spell the end for Dele Alli at the club? 

Meanwhile, across north London, midfield enforcer Lucas Torreira is being linked with a move away from Arsenal, with Atletico Madrid and Torino said to be keen.
