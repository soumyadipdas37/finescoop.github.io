Graeme Souness praised Arsenal's front-line after their victory against West Ham, but warned the Gunners the rest of the team could cost them this season.

Mikel Arteta's side worked hard to snatch a 2-1 victory thanks to a late goal from Eddie Nketiah. 

However it was a tough game for the Arsenal who were outperformed by the Hammers during spells of the game.

Graeme Souness has praised Arsenal's fire-power up front following their West Ham victory

Souness though holds concerns about the rest of the team which he feels may hold them back

Following the game, Sky Sports pundit Souness warned that Arsenal's team behind their front-three could dampen their chances of success this season.

He said:  'Arsenal got away with one tonight. I think it showed that Arsenal have got genuine creativity and real fire-power up front. 

'I thought the rest of the team looked average and that might cost them as the season goes on. 

'But when you've got special creative players and players that can finish them chances, that's what the difference was tonight. 

'At the top end Arsenal are very good, rest of it not so sure but we'll find that out over the next nine months.'

With their victory, Arsenal have started the season with two wins out of two and sit second in the table behind Everton on goal difference.

West Ham outplayed Arsenal despite their defeat and would feel hard done by from the loss

Arsenal have improved massively since Arteta was appointed manager.

Souness said: 'Arsenal were in a pretty sorry state when Arteta joined,  but they are playing with a bit of swagger right now and tails are up. 

'They'll watch the game back and realise they got away with it and were lucky. West Ham were spirited tonight, Arsenal were average but they've got these special players up front and West Ham will be feeling hard done by.'

Souness added that Arsenal will have to improve their levels of performance if they are to take a result at Anfield against champions Liverpool next weekend.
