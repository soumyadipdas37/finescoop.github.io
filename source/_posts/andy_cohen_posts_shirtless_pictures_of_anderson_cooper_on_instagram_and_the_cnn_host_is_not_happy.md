Andy Cohen has been known to serve friendship goals with Anderson Cooper, with their camaraderie spanning a quarter of a century.

But the Emmy winner is not above poking fun at his best pal, even with a combined 6.4million Instagram followers watching.

He took to his profile Tuesday with some sexy thirst trap throwbacks of the shirtless silver fox, later revealing that Cooper was not too amused with his social media shenanigans.

The 52-year-old captioned the photos: 'If it were a normal year, I’d be on vacation with my pal...threatening to post shirtless pics of him. 

'Well, it’s 2020 and I’m sitting on my deck so I figured I'd just post without asking and piss him off! #SilverFox'

He included an image of Cooper, 53, with a flower tucked behind his ear in a lush green locale, as well as one of him showing off his toned torso on a yacht.

Cohen later posted a video update to his Instagram Story, as he lounged on a waterfront porch in a red hoodie and black baseball cap.

So pissed: He addressed his followers: 'Anderson is so pissed at me, you guys. But listen, I'm just sitting here, bored under a blanket' Cohen concluded: 'So, what else am I supposed to do? Maybe I'll do an Instagram Live later, I don't know... And maybe I'll post more shirtless pictures of Anderson'

He addressed his followers: 'Anderson is so pissed at me, you guys. But listen, I'm just sitting here, bored under a blanket.'

'Show the blanket. Cue the blanket,' the Watch What Happens Live host held up a green striped blanket while sporadically looking off camera, jokingly asking: 'Am I supposed to show the blanket here, you guys? Show it now? Oh, OK.'

He joked around, while showing a glimpse of his porch: 'I'm just sitting here under a blanket. There's no one over there. All that's here is Ben's little drum set. Ben is sleeping, and I'm bored.

'So, what else am I supposed to do? Maybe I'll do an Instagram Live later, I don't know. I got Ben and Housewives cuts to watch. That's what's happening here... And maybe I'll post more shirtless pictures of Anderson.'

Cohen and Cooper have been best of pals since the early '90s, when they were almost set up on a blind date.

The CNN host told the story on a 2016 episode of WWHL: 'Andy and I were first set up on a blind date, which never happened because we had a phone call and after two minutes I said, "I’m not dating this guy."

Support system: They've frequently shown support for each other over the years, including during the death of Cooper's socialite mother Gloria Vanderbilt last June, as well as Cohen's recent recovery from COVID-19

Dad friends: The best buds have also navigated fatherhood together, Cohen welcoming son Benjamin, one, last February, and Cooper announcing the birth of son Wyatt, four months, in April, with partner Benjamin Maisani, 47

'He broke my cardinal rule… He mentioned my mom within the first four sentences of meeting me.' 

They've frequently shown support for each other over the years, including during the death of Cooper's socialite mother Gloria Vanderbilt last June, as well as Cohen's recent recovery from COVID-19.

The best buds have also navigated fatherhood together, Cohen welcoming son Benjamin, one, last February, and Cooper announcing the birth of son Wyatt, four months, in April, with partner Benjamin Maisani, 47.

Cohen has said he hopes their sons will be 'be best friends' like their dads, and he's even helped out with hand-me-down clothes and recommending his own nanny. 

He told USA Today last August of their friendship: 'We've gotten much closer since I've had the talk show and since we've been on tour together. I mean we've been friends for 25 years. He's just an incredibly loyal and caring and sensitive and great friend.'

The pals have hosted the New Year's Eve ball drop in New York City for three consecutive years, as well as headlining their own conversational stage tour AC2: An Intimate Evening with Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen since 2016.
