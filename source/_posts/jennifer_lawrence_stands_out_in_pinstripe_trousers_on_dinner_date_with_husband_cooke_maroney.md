She's been enjoying some well-deserved downtime with her husband Cooke Maroney in lockdown.

And Jennifer Lawrence continued her break from her typically busy schedule as she and art dealer Cooke enjoyed a dinner date in New York City on Wednesday evening.

The actress, 30, caught the eye in monochrome pinstripe trousers as she and her man, 34, sported protective face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Quality time: Jennifer Lawrence continued her break from her typically busy schedule as she and her husband Cooke Maroney enjoyed a dinner date in New York City on Wednesday 

Dressing down her look, the Red Sparrow star teamed her patterned bottoms with a plain white T-shirt and comfy trainers.

The media personality carried her essentials in a chain-strap handbag, while her tresses were worn loose.

Cooke, meanwhile, looked effortlessly cool in a designer T-shirt, baggy trousers and a dark jacket.

Jennifer married the gallerist at the Belcourt of Newport in Rhode Island in front of celebrity guests including Adele, Cameron Diaz and Emma Stone back in October 2019.

The Hunger Games star was linked to Cooke after they were introduced by mutual friends, and by last February, the blonde was spotted wearing an engagement ring.

'Well, he's just the best person I've ever met in my whole life. It was a very, very easy decision,' she told Entertainment Tonight after accepting his proposal. 

'Jennifer and Cooke were at the weddings bureau together on the morning of September 16,' an insider previously said.

They added: 'They had a female friend and a photographer with them the entire time. They sat in the couches to the left and were trying to remain unseen.' 

Last month, it was reported that the thespian made a colossal $5.7million loss on her sprawling New York City penthouse as it finally sold for $9.9million after a year on the market. 

The Oscar-winning star slashed more than $3million off the original price of $15.6million in January, asking for offers of $12million.
