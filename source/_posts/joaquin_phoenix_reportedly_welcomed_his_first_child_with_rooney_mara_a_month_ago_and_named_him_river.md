Joaquin Phoenix has reportedly welcomed his first child with fiancee Rooney Mara, a baby boy named after his late brother, River Phoenix.  

Director Victor Kossakovsky made the revelation at the 2020 Zurich Film Festival after a screening of the film Gunda, which was executive produced by Joaquin.  

'He just got baby by the way... A beautiful son called River,' Victor told audience members. 

Rooney never confirmed her pregnancy, but recent photos of her attempting to obscure a bump fueled baby speculation.
