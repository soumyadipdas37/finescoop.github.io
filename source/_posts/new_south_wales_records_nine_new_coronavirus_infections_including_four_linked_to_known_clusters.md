New South Wales has recorded nine new cases of coronavirus, including one from an unknown source.

Of the newest cases recorded on Sunday, four are returned travellers in hotel quarantine while another four are locally acquired and linked to known cases.

Two of the locally-acquired cases are household contacts linked to the Eastern Suburbs Legion Club cluster and the other two are linked to St Paul's Catholic College Greystanes.

All four cases have been in self-isolation while infectious.

The other  case is locally acquired and under investigation. 

NSW Health also advised an infected person visited KFC in Concord on September 6 with anyone who was at the restaurant between 1pm and 1.20pm that day considered a casual contact.

They have been advised to monitor for symptoms.

NSW Health acting director Dr Christine Selvey urged people to immediately get tested if they feel unwell and to maintain social distancing.

"COVID-19 continues to spread in the community and we must all continue to help stop the spread of this disease," Dr Selvey said in a video update on Sunday.

NSW Health is treating 83 COVID-19 cases including six in intensive care, three of whom are being ventilated.
