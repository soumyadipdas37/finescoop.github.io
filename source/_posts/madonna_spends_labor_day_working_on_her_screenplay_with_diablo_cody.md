It's been a mix of work and play for this international music superstar of late. 

And Madonna took to her Instagram over the holiday weekend to inform her fans that she was spending the downtime hard at work on her recent and very buzzy film project – a screenplay with Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody.

Madge, who turned 62 last month, uploaded a gallery of studious selfies on Monday, some showing her in cay-eye spectacles poring over a film script that looked marked up.

In the snaps, the Grammy and Golden Globe winner wore a ribbed grey tank top, and camouflage sweats.

As always, Madonna sported a multitude of jewelry, including necklaces, charm bracelets and bangles, along with a colorful manicure.

The Queen of Pop wore her blond hair crimped and down in the selfies, with the dark roots grown out. 

The caption for the spread read, 'In honor of labor day I will work,' along with a muscle flexing emoji and the hashtag #screenplay.

The post comes after a prior video post on the Material Girl's feed, shared September 2nd, that ostensibly confirmed that the project they're working is indeed Madonna's life story.

In that snippet, Madonna begins by joking, 'I'm writing a different script.'

Cody, 42, laughs at this and says, 'What if you're writing someone else's life story, while I write yours?'

The proof wasn't even needed, as it's been clear from the Ray Of Light singer's feed that she's been reminiscing on her life and achievements more than usual of late.

Another recent post showed her Madgesty along with the Juno Academy Award winner looking over Madonna's inflammatory 1992 photobook Sex, during which they openly wonder what all the fuss was about at the time.

'Looking back its hard to believe that this book caused so much controversy,' the Erotica hitmaker captioned that clip.

'And have we moved forward?' she continued. 'Is the Patriarchal world we live in ready to accept Women expressing their Sexuality?'

Madonna added the hashtags #sex #wap #controversy and #diablocody.

It was one of multiple references the Desperately Seeking Susan star has recently made to WAP, Cardi B's raunchy runaway hit with Megan Thee Stallion, to which she feels she's served as somewhat of a 'precursor'. 

The most recent social media activity comes after Madonna spent much of August celebrating both her own birthday, which was on August 16th, as well as her youngest twin daughters Estere and Stella, who turned eight years old just days later.
