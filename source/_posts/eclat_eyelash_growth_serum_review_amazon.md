Can a quick slick of eyelash serum give you longer, fuller lashes? Amazon shoppers have stumbled upon a formula by Eclat Natural Skincare that they claim 'is a miracle worker' and is so good it brings extension-damaged eyelashes back to life.

Not only does the Eclat Eyelash Growth Serum give you impressive results, but it's also easy to apply and costs a purse-friendly £6.98.

It's currently the number one bestselling item in Amazon's Eyelash Treatments category - and it's easy to see why shoppers love it.

Reviewers call the vegan-friendly and cruelty-free eyelash serum 'amazing' and describe the change they see in their lashes as 'remarkable'.

Thanks to a blend of natural ingredients including growth-stimulating peptides and conditioning pro-vitamin B5, this serum enhances the look of lash length, thickness, and fullness.

The brand claims that more than 90 per cent of users agreed their lashes were visibly longer and thicker within four weeks, and in six weeks 85 per cent saw improvement in fullness. 

 'For the first time in 14 years, I felt confident enough to leave my house with no mascara on!' raved one Amazon shopper. 'And now when I do use mascara they have so much more volume and look crazy long.

'My friends have even asked me if I've changed my mascara when what has actually changed is my happy lashes! My second order is on its way now.'

'I was sceptical at first, but this serum is AMAZING,' wrote another. 'My eyelashes look so much better, longer and they look in better condition. It has helped with my eyebrows as well.'

A third shopper added: 'This is a little gem of a product. I'd never go back to lash extensions, and I will repeatedly buy this whenever my first purchase runs out.

'Make it a part of your daily/nightly routine, a nice amount along your lash line, and you won't regret it.'

While the Eclat Eyelash Growth Serum's formula shows plenty of potential, you'll have to be patient and consistent to see results. It's worth noting though that some reviewers say they see a difference in their lashes in as little as a few days.

One shopper wrote: 'I purchased after removing my lashes and being left with hardly any lashes of my own.

'Within a few days, I noticed the short lashes were growing back. A few weeks later, my lashes, on the whole, appeared fuller and slightly longer than normal.'

Application is straightforward: you apply Eclat Eyelash Growth Serum (daily in the evening) from the inner corner of the eye outwards to the base of the upper lash using the applicator brush.
