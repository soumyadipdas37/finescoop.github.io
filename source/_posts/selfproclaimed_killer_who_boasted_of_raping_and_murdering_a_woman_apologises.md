A man with bipolar who bragged about abducting, raping and stabbing a young woman to death has apologised to her family for making up the entire story.

Denis Briggs claimed he killed Jan­ine Vaughan, who disappeared after a night out with friends in Bathurst, three hours west of Sydney, in December 2001.

Briggs told his friends he was responsible for her death, but later admitted he lied because he was 'unhinged,' drinking excessively, and suffering delusions of grandeur.

The 55-year-old, who now lives a reclusive life in a small northern NSW town, recently met up with Ms Vaughan's family to apologise for the heartache he caused them nearly two decades ago.

Janine Vaughan, 31,  left the Metro Tavern in Bathurst just before 4am following a night out with friends. She was last seen getting into a car, and her body has never been found 

'It makes me feel terrible, sort of speaking to you now, that I said all them dreadful things, which I never would have contemplated doing,' he told Janine's sister Kyle Spelde and brother Adam Vaughan, The Australian reported.  

'I think, "What the bloody hell was I thinking, saying all that terrible stuff?" I can tell you now, I can tell you to your face, I definitely had nothing to do with Janine's dis­appearance. I'm telling the absolute truth. No word of a lie this time.'

Briggs had been working at an aged care home in Bathurst when Ms Vaughan, 31,  vanished in the early hours of December 7, 2001. 

The clothing store manager left the Metro Tavern just before 4am following a night out with friends.

She was emotional after having lost her handbag somewhere inside the pub and couldn't find it.  

Briggs gloated that he picked Ms Vaughan up and drove her away from the town before trying to rape her. He said he stabbed her, slit her throat and buried her in a bush

As the sun began to rise, Ms Vaughan got separated from her friends as she walked ahead of them to see if another venue was open.

A small red car driven by a mystery driver then pulled up next to Ms Vaughun. The passenger door opened up and she got in.

Ms Vaughan was never seen again and her body has never been found.   

Her disappearance rocked the small town, with locals guessing who could was driving the car.

Briggs gloated that he picked Ms Vaughan up and drove her away from the town before trying to rape her. He said he stabbed her, slit her throat and buried her in a bush.

People were initially inclined to believe Briggs' confession because he has bipolar and was medicated on antipsychotic drugs to control his mood swings, but had recently stopped taking his medication.

Even more coincidental was town rumours that he had become obsessed with Ms Vaughan following the breakdown of his relationship. 

Briggs even owned a salmon coloured Hyundai Excel that matched the car Ms Vaughan got into.

He now blames his friend Peter Barker for 'hounding' him into making a false confession, and said being off his medication added to his confusion.

Briggs said Mr Barker continuously asked him if he had killed Ms Vaughan, so he told him an 'outrageous story' so he could back off. 

'I said I cut her throat … and I cut her fingers off or some bloody thing, and then I said I raped her seven times or something. I was unhinged, yeah I was right off my tree. I was drinking outrageously,' Briggs told The Night Driver podcast, which is exploring the mystery of Ms Vaughan's disappearance.

Briggs said he would never want to hurt someone, but admitted he 'would have said anything' at the time.

Ms Vaughan's younger brother Adam said that while he accepted Briggs' explanation, the possibility remains of his sister still being alive somewhere.
