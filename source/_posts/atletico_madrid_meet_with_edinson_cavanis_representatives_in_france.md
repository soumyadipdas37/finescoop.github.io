Edinson Cavani could be heading for a reunion with Uruguay team-mate Luis Suarez after Atletico Madrid stepped up their interest by meeting his representatives.

The 33-year-old is a free agent having left Paris Saint-Germain in the summer after spending seven years in the French capital.

Real Madrid and Benfica have been linked with the former Napoli star this summer, but he has yet to find a new club.

Atletico Madrid met with the representatives of Edinson Cavani over a possible move

And, according to L'Equipe, Atletico have now thrown their hat into the ring, with club chiefs dispatched to the French capital on Monday to meet the player's agents.

They are due to meet in a hotel, where discussions will focus on the possibility of a two-year deal in the Spanish capital. 

Cavani had spent a large chunk of lockdown in his native Uruguay, but has now been preparing himself physically for a return to football.

Diego Simeone is already close to the signature of one Uruguayan in the form of Luis Suarez

If that is with Atletico, it could be alongside his compatriot Suarez, who appears on the cusp of signing for Diego Simeone's side.

The striker left the Barcelona training ground in tears on Wednesday morning after saying his goodbyes to team-mates after being forced out of the club. 

And Simeone could be set to make it a trio of Uruguayans, with the Argentine boss also keen on bringing Lucas Torreira in from Arsenal.
