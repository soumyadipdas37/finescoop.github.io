YouTube star Olivia Jade Giannulli's musician boyfriend Jackson Guthy was booked into jail for DUI just two days before her shamed Fuller House star mother requested to serve college cheating scandal sentence at a medium-security prison.

Olivia Jade has tied to lead a quieter life in the two years since her parents were busted in the bribery scam to get their children into USC but earlier this month her boyfriend of two years landed in his own legal troubles.

Guthy, 24, was booked for misdemeanor driving under the influence after he was pulled over in California on September 7, Us Weekly reported Tuesday.

Guthy was busted behind the wheel in Santa Monica around 3.13pm and was released from custody at 7.28pm, booking records show.

He was booked two days before the DUI Olivia's mother Lori Loughlin requested to serve her two month sentence for the college admissions scandal at a medium security prison. Mossimo Giannulli was sentenced to five months. They are supposed to report to prison on November 19

It's unknown what may have impaired his driving that afternoon.

DailyMail.com has reached out to a representative for Guthy. 

Earlier this year the city of Santa Monica cracked down on DUI by setting up checkpoints and conducting stops after California saw 'a disturbing increase in drug-impaired driving crashes'.

The Office of Traffic Safety has campaigned that 'DUI Doesn't Just Mean Booze,' and warns that 'if you take prescription drugs, particularly those with a driving or operating machinery warning on the label, you might be impaired enough to get a DUI.'

'Marijuana can also be impairing, especially in combination with alcohol or other drugs, and can result in a DUI,' they added.

Marijuana is available to those with a prescription in California.

While the musician and Olivia Jade have been on-and-off – breaking up in May 2019 around the time of her parents' scandal and reuniting last August – they couple has been seen out together as recently as last Wednesday.

It's unknown whether the YouTuber was with Guthy at the time of the incident. 'Olivia really loves him,' a source previously told Us. 'He's so chill and laid-back that she can't help but be comfortable around him'

Olivia Jade restricted her social circle in the wake of Operation Varsity Blues as she lost business deals when it emerged her parents paid to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits even though neither girl was a rower

The pair were spotted holding hands at Delilah restaurant in LA.

It's unknown whether Olivia Jade, who turned 21 on Monday, was with Guthy when he was pulled over this month.

However after shying away from the spotlight so not to further damage her influencer brand in the wake of Operation Varsity Blues, Guthy is one of the few people the vlogger will see these days according to reports.

'Olivia really loves him,' a source previously told Us. 'He's so chill and laid-back that she can't help but be comfortable around him.'

'Throughout this ordeal, Olivia was distant from her former sorority sisters and certain people she was close to before the news broke,' another insider told Us Weekly in May. 

'Her former friends were not sure if it was based on legal advice or the fact that she felt too embarrassed to face the situation to old friends. Now, Olivia has been more open to communicating with them and rekindling those friendships.'

Lori Laughlin was sentenced in August to two months in prison and issued $150,000 in fines for her participation in the scheme by helping her two daughters fake qualifications to get into the University of Southern California.

She and her fashion designer husband paid to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits even though neither girl was a rower. 

Mossimo Giannulli was sentenced to five months. They are supposed to report to prison on November 19.
