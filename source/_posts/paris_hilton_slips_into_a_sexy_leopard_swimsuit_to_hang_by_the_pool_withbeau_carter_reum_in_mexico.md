Hilton and Reum, who appear to be staying at the popular Nobu Resort, walked around leisurely with their hands interlocked.  

Paris had a bright yellow canvas bag over her shoulder that had the humorous phrase 'I'm a ray of f**king sunshine' printed on it.

She wore her signature blonde hair in two ponytails and concealed her hazel eyes behind a pair of large sunglasses.

Going strong: Paris and Carter have been dating since January of this year

'When we first met, I had no idea of the amazing journey I was about to embark on. My life was always empty, like I was missing something. But when I met you, I knew you were the one,' she began.

Paris included a black-and-white snapshot of herself and Reum sharing a tender moment.

She continued: 'You’ve filled my heart with so much love. I believe that everything happens for a reason because everything in my life, all the good and the bad, has led me right to you.

'You are my reason for me being so happy and feeling like the luckiest girl in the world! I love making you happy and promise to make you smile forever

'Love so much handsome! Happy anniversary!' concluded Hilton, along with a lightening bolt emoji,' concluded Hilton in the post seen by her 12.5million followers.

Though things with Carter are going great, it was not always smoothing sailing for Paris when it came to relationships.

In a recent interview with People, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life.

'I was strangled, I was hit, I was grabbed aggressively. I put up with things no one should,' said the star, who believes she was set up for a future of abusive relationships while attending the Provo Canyon boarding school as a teenager.

Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.

'They all seemed like such nice guys and then the true colors would show,' Paris explained. 'They'd get jealous, or defensive or try to control me. And there there would come a point where they would become physically, verbally and emotionally abusive.'

Paris initially interpreted the 'crazy' behavior as an indicator of just how much they loved her.

'Looking back, I can't believe I let people treat me like that,' she said.
