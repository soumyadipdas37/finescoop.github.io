A farm owner in West Yorkshire received a £10,000 fine after he hosted a wedding party which was attended by up to 300 guests where a 'fight broke out'.

Police were called between 5-6pm to Scarecrow Farm in New Farnley, Leeds, on September 26 after receiving reports of a wedding celebration at a marquee.

It had been reported that between 100 and 300 guests were in attendance at the celebration.

After arriving at the site, officers confirmed that a large number of people were in attendance and that loud music was playing from a marquee in the woods.

Vehicles were still seen entering the grounds despite the police presence, so police vehicles were positioned to block entrances.

Large groups of guests attempted to leave the site around 9.30pm while officers tried to identify the party's organisers.

Police continued to watch the site overnight and seized two industrial-sized generators.

Leeds District Commander, Chief Superintendent Damien Miller said: 'This large-scale event was an absolutely blatant breach of the Coronavirus restrictions that are in place to keep our communities safe from this ongoing threat to public health.

'It is even more appalling that it came only the day after widespread media coverage highlighting the increased restrictions in Leeds that have been put in place to address recent rises in the district's Coronavirus rates.

'Everyone should know by now what is expected of them, and no-one can be in any doubt that large gatherings such as this are completely unacceptable.

'We are maintaining our approach of engaging, explaining and encouraging compliance in the first instance, but, as this latest incident demonstrates, we will not hesitate to make full use of the legislation to take firm action against those who put everyone at risk by flouting the regulations.'

A 49-year-old man was identified as being one of the landowners and was reported for summons for holding a gathering of more than 30 people in breach of Coronavirus legislation, which carries a £10,000 fine.

This comes after the government announced a local lockdown in Leeds and surrounding areas in West Yorkshire on September 25.

Infection rates have soared to more than 100 cases per 100,000 people in the area.
