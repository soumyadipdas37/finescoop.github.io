At least eleven police officers have been injured by a 'corrosive substance' during a drugs raid in north London.  

Officers had attended an industrial estate in Barnet to execute a drugs warrant today when several were 'injured by a suspected corrosive substance,' the Metropolitan Police said.

Witnesses reported hearing a 'loud bang' before 'hundreds' of officers flooded the area, alongside scores of paramedics and fire crews.

Eleven officers were rushed to hospital for treatment after coming into contact with the substance, but none of their injuries are thought to be life-threatening.   

Several men who were arrested on suspicion of drugs offences were also taken to hospital after suffering injuries 'related to the substance,' police said.
