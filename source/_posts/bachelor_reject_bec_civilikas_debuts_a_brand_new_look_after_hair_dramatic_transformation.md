She was left heartbroken after being rejected by Locky Gilbert during a shock double-elimination ceremony on The Bachelor. 

And it seems Bec Civilikas, 25, has found solace in the hairdresser's chair, having debuted a new, post-breakup hairdo on Tuesday. 

The Gold Coast glamazon surprised fans by uploading a glamorous selfie that showcased her much shorter-looking locks.

Hair today, gone tomorrow! The Bachelor's Bec Civilikas, 25, shocked fans on Tuesday by uploading this selfie after cutting and dying her hair 

Gone were her famous peroxide tresses, replaced by a light brown hue that perfectly complemented her brown eyes and golden tan. 

'So I did a thing,' the beauty consultant wrote, adding a covered-eyes emoji and a haircut emoji. 

Several of Bec's former Bachelor co-stars showered her with compliments, including Leilani Vakaahi who wrote: 'Wooooow [love heart emoji]' 

My, how you've changed! Gone were her famous peroxide tresses, replaced by a light brown hue that perfectly complemented her brown eyes and golden tan. Bec pictured left in June, right on Tuesday  

'Lurveee it', fellow co-star Bec Colwel added. 

Bec's transformation comes amid speculation she's set to appear in the 2021 season of Bachelor In Paradise. 

According to Sportsbet Bec is an extremely likely contender for the show, with current odds of $1.75. 

Double the sorrow! Bec was left heartbroken after being rejected alongside Izzy Sharman-Firth during a double-elimination ceremony on The Bachelor 

Others hotly tipped to star in the show from Locky's season include - Zoe-Clare McDonald, Juliette Herrera, Areeba Emmanuel, Roxi Kenny and Kaitlyn Hoppe.  

Spotlight-loving runner-up Bella Varelis also seems likely to make an appearance, tipped at $3.75. 

Bachelor In Paradise usually films every November at Fiji's Mango Bay Resort - however with most interstate borders still closed and international travel mostly out of the question, it seems unlikely that contestants will be able to fly out for the series.

Instead, it has been speculated that filming will take place in Australia, with The Wash previously reporting producers are considering  a popular tourist destination in QLD as a possible location.  

A second chance at love? Bec's transformation comes amid speculation she's set to appear in the 2021 season of Bachelor In Paradise
