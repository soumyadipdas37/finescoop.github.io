Series 11 of The Great British Bake Off got off to a dramatic start on Tuesday night, with a Freddie Mercury disaster, accusations of sabotage and pineapple upside-down cakes which ended up... upside down.

And after 90 minutes a firm fan favourite has emerged - 31-year-old pharmacy worker Sura.

Sura was at the centre of the premiere episode's most dramatic moment, when she accidentally knocked fellow baker's Dave's technical bake onto the floor seconds before judging, but despite the disaster fans were out in force on Twitter supporting the chaotic contestant.

Even Sura's introduction caused a plethora of tweets, as her home video showed her walking her pet cat Ghost near her London home.

'Sura walking her cat on a lead... I will die for Sura from the Great British Bake Off tent,' gushed one already-loyal fan. 

The Signature Bake challenge saw the bakers puts their own spin on a Battenberg cake, but Sura wasn't exactly enamoured by the choice of bake for the first task.

New presenter Matt Lucas casually asked her if she was a fan, prompting Sura to pull a face before launching into a rant about her hatred of... cake.   

'I'm so over cake, I don't want to eat anymore cake ever again,' she told a flabbergasted Matt. 

The moment of the show though came with the Techinical challenge, with the bakers tasked with recreating Paul Hollywood's six mini pineapple upside-down cakes. 

All was going swimmingly for Sura until it came to the transfer from baker's bench to the judging table.

Spotting a fly perching on her creations, she started to swat the creepy crawly away, only to accidentally knock contestant Dave's baked goods onto the floor.  

'I'm so sorry. Oh my god. I'm so sorry there was a fly, I went to shoo it away and I knocked it', a devastated Sura told her grim-faced rival.

There was more Sura-drama to come though as the final Showstopper challenge saw the homebakers asked to recreate a bust of their hero in cake 3D cake form. 

While many opted for music idols such as Freddie Mercury or David Bowie, Sura got to work crafting Sir David Attenborough's likeness out of sponge. 'I LOVE Sura she's so PURE,' declared one delighted viewer on Twitter. 

All was going well for the fan favourite until the bakers were told to leave their creations in the tent and go and wait for the judging outside.

Sura gasped as she saw her Attenborough bust slowly collapse inside the tent before she broke into a run to try and save her Showstopper. 'I never run,' she said during the frantic jog.

'Sura 'I never run' - IK hear ya girl, you see me running then you should run as well,' agreed one fan.

The baker, who had minutes earlier helped Laura rescue her Freddie Mercury bust, managed to save her David with the help of some strategically placed piping bags, delivering the iconic line to Prue and Paul 'he's having a nap.'
