Dax Shepard is celebrating 16 years of being sober.

The Bless This Mess actor's family was right by his side as he marked the milestone, with wife Kristen Bell taking to Instagram to praise her other half for his hard work and dedication.

The Good Place star, 40, wasn't the only one giving Shepard, 45, congrats, she also shared a precious 'Happy Sobriety Birthday' card one of their daughters made for their dad in the post.

Strength to overcome: Kristen Bell and her daughters celebrated Dax Shepard's 16th 'sobriety birthday' on Wednesday with an absolutely adorable hand-made card

'Happy Sobriety Birthday Dady,' their youngster scrawled in red marker. On the back she added the Harry Potter character Ron Weasley and a red heart-shaped balloon.

Bell - who has been married to Shepard since 2013 - didn't say whether daughter Delta, five, or Lincoln, seven, was responsible for the sweet note.

She joined in the praise in her caption, writing: 'Today is my husband's 16th sobriety birthday. My daughter woke him up with this sign, and a sketch of the one and only Ronald Weasley(absolutely random, and also perfect).'

'Happy birthday Daxy. Thank you for dedicating your life to the hard and wonderful work of sobriety, so that we could share it with you.

Gratitude: Bell praised her husband of seven-years in the caption saying  'Thank you for dedicating your life to the hard and wonderful work of sobriety, so that we could share it with you'

Sweetest thing: 'Happy Sobriety Birthday Dady,' their youngster scrawled in red marker. On the back she added the Harry Potter character Ron Weasley and a red heart-shaped balloon

She then signed the note with everyone's initials, writing: 'Xo K, L & D.'

Dax and Bell have been open about how sobriety is a constant commitment.

'I know how much effort has to be put into staying sober,' Kristen told People in 2018.

'I don't mean that to be like, I come home and see him shaking and looking at a whiskey ad or something, [but] there are different elements you have to deal with when you're staying sober. It's a ton of mental control and evolution.'
