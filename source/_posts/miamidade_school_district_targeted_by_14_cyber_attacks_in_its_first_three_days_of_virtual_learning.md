Florida's largest school district in Miami-Dade County has been targeted by a slew of cyber attacks in the first three days of its virtual start to the school year.   

Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced that the district was hit with 12 separate cyber attacks on Wednesday morning, some which were local and some from outside of the US. 

It came after the district suffered two other distributed denial of service attacks on Monday and Tuesday in which a software glitch blocked access to the district's servers. 

MDCPS, which serves 275,000 students and is using virtual learning due to the coronavirus pandemic, is now working with the FBI to determine who is behind the attacks and how to stop them from derailing the fall semester right out of the gate.

Superintendent Carvalho disclosed the latest attacks - which took place from 8.19am to 10.59am on Wednesday - at a school board committee meeting, according to the Miami Herald. 

He said the district staved off the first four attacks but a 'fast' fifth one blocked students and teachers from logging into the system and kicked out users who were already logged on.   

Describing the attack that took place on Tuesday, Carvalho said: 'There was a malicious attempt, malicious, well-orchestrated, complex attempt at derailing, destroying the connection which is essential for our students and teachers.' 

It wasn't known who initiated the attack, but Carvalho said he wants them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 

He added that the FBI and Secret Service were called in and subpoenaed the school district's internet provider, Comcast.

MDCPS Chief Academic Officer Marie Izquierdo on Wednesday said that the district has not been hacked and no data has been compromised in any of the attacks.

The district is conducting classes through My School Online (MSO), a virtual learning platform run by education tech giant K12. 

Izquierdo acknowledged issues with the platform, which went down nationally on Wednesday. 

She said that while content was still accessible during the shutdown, a directive went out to all schools using MSO telling students and teachers in grades 6 through 12 to get off the platform because of 'issues on the content side'.

Many teachers and students have complained about not being able to see their classes on MSO, according to the Herald.  

But Izquierdo appeared to question those complaints, saying: 'I don't believe everything I'm told on the 6-12 side of the house right now.'

She added that teachers 'need to determine whether or not they are comfortable having sessions on [MSO] class connect or move to [Microsoft] Teams.'

School Board member Steve Gallon, who is also vice chair of the board, reacted to the cyber attacks on Tuesday and said he wants answers. 

'My number one question will not simply be about the attack, but about what provisions and policies and practices we have in place to mitigate and abate those particular attacks,' he told Local 10.

Gallon said he wasn't surprised that the district was targeted given that it's the fourth largest in the nation with a $5.5billion budget. 

He said he expects the attacks to prompt a larger conversation about the overall readiness of schools reopening online - which he said has been a failure thus far.  

'These are issues that manifested themselves not simply Monday,' he said. 'We've had some challenges relative to this particular platform as early as last week.'

Comcast, the service provider for MDCPS, addressed the issues in a statement on Tuesday and vowed to help resolve them. 

'Comcast has a longstanding relationship with the Miami Dade County Public Schools and we place tremendous value on the partnership we have built together over time,' the statement read. 

'We have worked together to connect tens of thousands of families to the internet, so any issue that could impact internet access is one that we take very seriously.

'Comcast became aware of an issue impacting the Miami Dade School District network, causing many families to be unable to access the learning site as the school day began. 

'Given this took place during the beginning of school, we understand how important connectivity is for virtual learning during this unprecedented time. 

'We are continuing to monitor the situation and are working with the school district and law enforcement to ensure this doesn't happen again. We sincerely apologize to the families, teachers and students who were kept offline.'
