Allan's switch to Everton drew ever closer on Wednesday afternoon as the Brazilian midfielder was pictured arriving in Liverpool on a private jet.

The Napoli midfielder was seen exiting the aircraft with his wife Thais Marques and the pair were collected by a member of club staff.  

He travelled to Liverpool to undergo a medical with Everton ahead of sealing a £21million switch, which will see him reunite with Carlo Ancelotti.

The pair worked together during Ancelotti's tenure in Naples and the Italian made Allan a primary target as he looks to refresh Everton's midfield on the eve of the new Premier League season. 

Allan, a Brazil international, adds international pedigree as well as Champions League experience to Everton's group.

He has been at Napoli since 2015 and has made 212 appearances in all competitions for the Italian side. 

 Allan has established himself as a reliable midfielder in Serie A, winning the Coppa Italia

Allan was part of the side that won last season's Coppa Italia, as Genarro Gattuso's side beat Serie A champions Juventus on penalties in the final.

His exit from Napoli was expected last year when Paris Saint-Germain declared their interest but with Ancelotti in charge, Allan stayed in Naples. 

Now the pair appear ready to renew acquaintances in England.  

Allan is the first piece in what could be a busy rebuilding summer for Ancelotti in midfield and attack.  

The Italian boss is also keen to reunite with another of his former players in the shape of James Rodriguez.

The Colombian is out of favour at Real Madrid with Zinedine Zidane and Ancelotti looks ready to offer him a rout out. 

Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in 2014 from Monaco, has struggled to convince at the Bernabeu, having been sent out on loan for two seasons to Bayern Munich in 2017. 

Despite being handed chances to impress by Zinedine Zidane, it is now clear his future remains away from the LaLiga champions, and Goodison Park could prove his next destination.
