One of John Edwards' ten children has left a murder-suicide inquest in tears speaking of her lifetime of terror and how she wished she could have saved the siblings she never got to meet.  

Edwards shot dead his daughter Jennifer, 13, and son Jack, 15, in West Pennant Hills in Sydney's north-west on July 5, 2018.  

The 67-year-old killed himself at his rented home near Normanhurst on the night of the killings. Five months after the murders, the mother of the children, Olga, took her own life.

Before her suicide, the heartbroken mother carried around the ashes of her slain children in two urns - one pink and another blue. 

The deaths have been the focus of an inquest in the NSW Coroners Court over the past three weeks, which has heard of the financial planner's shocking history of domestic violence. 

John Edwards shot dead his daughter Jennifer (left), 13, and son Jack (right), 15, in West Pennant Hills in Sydney's north-west on July 5, 2018.

On Thursday, one of Edwards' children - who never met their slain half-siblings - told the court they understood the teenagers' struggles.

'They were other versions of us,' she said.

'They had lived with John.'  

The daughter also recounted the moment Olga asked her to hold the urns of her half-siblings.  

'When I did I wept, not only for my siblings but as a mother, feeling Olga's immense grief in my hands,' she told the court.  

The courtroom was left in tears as the daughter spoke.

'Their mother loved them so much, just like our mothers. She was the last one. The one to bear it all. A lifetime of his anger pent up and unleashed,' she said. 

After Edwards' fatally shot Jack and Jennifer, their heartbroken mother Olga (pictured) carried around their ashes in two urns - one pink and another blue 

Four people linked by blood or marriage to Edwards appeared before the inquest on Thursday and spoke of the fear, control and abuse suffered over decades. 

'He was not the good bloke who lived next door,' a former partner said.

'He was not - as he claimed - a victim of the Family Court system.'

One of Edwards' children said she 'got to survive John but Jack and Jennifer did not'.

She recalled the time Edwards ran a lit cigarette lighter along the lounge room coffee table as he yelled at her nursing mother.

'Should I set fire to the whole house? Is that what you want me to do?' she said he yelled.

The daughter said she was forced to endure court-ordered visits after her mother left Edwards. 

She said the time spent alone with Edwards 'was not fun' and she feared he would kidnap her.

The girl had an 'abduction plan' drilled into her in case Edwards ran off with her and her young brother.

Edwards, 67, turned the gun on himself at a rented home near Normanhurst, northern Sydney (pictured) 

The daughter recalled one occasion where Edwards used his feet to kick her out of the car while dropping her off after a visit. 

He drove off with her brother still inside and police were called. The officers attended Edwards' home but returned without the boy, she said.  

'He managed to say all the right things and convince them he had rightful custody,' the now-adult woman said.

Another former partner saw parts of herself in Jack and Jennifer's mother Olga - who met Edwards online when she was just 18.

'I was a young, naive 17-year-old when I met John Edwards,' she said.

'The emotional, physical and monetary impact has been the same.

'He made our lives hell. You had to live it to really understand that someone could behave the way he did.'

Like Olga, she tried to get away - escaping over a backyard fence with her children while Edwards was showering.

Minutes earlier she had felt Edwards' wrath over an unironed shirt and had dodged a rolling pin thrown full pelt at her head.

And just like Olga, she wasn't allowed to leave in peace - tracked down at a relative's home and dragged through the courts for 11 years.

'In the end, he won,' she said.

'He got to keep everything and got to see the kids.

'He was not going to be told by anyone what he could do and couldn't do.'

Noting the cruel nature of Jack and Jennifer's deaths and her continuing post-traumatic stress disorder, the woman said Edwards' suicide had brought her some immediate relief.

'After 40 years of constant fear ... I drove off in my car and I didn't have to check in my rear-vision mirror to see if I was being followed,' she said.

State Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan is due to hand down her findings on December 18.
