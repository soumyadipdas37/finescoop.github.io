A mother in Florida recorded the disturbing moment her teenage daughter began to shake violently and uncontrollably in an ambulance after a fellow teen gave her candy laced with drugs. 

Beth Richards recorded in terror as her tenth-grade daughter Autumn had to be rushed to hospital after she claimed to have accidentally ingested synthetic THC, the main psychoactive component of marijuana.  

The boy who gave Autumn the gummy has been identified but no arrests have been made, according to News 4 Jax. 

The young girl is said to be in a good condition but continues to randomly shake all over and still has to be spoon fed.

Autumn was brought for emergency medical treatment on Thursday after she was handed the laced gummy at Bartram Trail High School believing it to be an innocent candy. 

Her mother Beth said she did not understand what was happening to her as they were transported to the hospital. 

Beth's video from the ambulance shows a paramedic holding her daughter in place as she jerks on the stretcher. 

'Her eyes were beginning to become fixed and dilated. She wasn't blinking. It was pretty horrific sight,' she told News 4 Jax. 

'I've never seen a look like that in someone's eyes before,' Richards added. 

'To look at your child and see no life it is the most horrific thing you will ever see as a parent.' 

Beth later took videos from the hospital in which Autumn can be seen having to be fed as her hands start to shake so suddenly that she can not do it herself. 

As she left the hospital, Autumn appeared in good spirts but was still unable to keep control over the twitches caused by the drug.   

The teenager identified as the culprit faces no charges as yet but could be hit with a serious punishment from the school district.

Mom Beth Richards hopes her daughter's experience will act as a warning to others

The sheriff's office has sent the gummies to be tested to confirm it was THC

Later videos of Autumn show how she can still not control the shake of her arms

Autumn told her mother that she did not know the candy she took contained drugs

'This incident constitutes a Level 4 offense in our Student Code of Conduct, which is the most serious,' said a statement from the St. Johns County School District. 

St. Johns County Sheriff's Office is still investigating the incident and the gummies have been sent to a lab to confirm it was THC. 

Beth Richards now hopes that her daughter's story will work as a warning, as she encourages other parents to have a serious conversation with their children about not taking candy from others, no matter how safe it appears. 

'It could've happened anywhere. Regardless of this happening at school; that doesn't matter. This could've happened at McDonalds, it could have happened at a playground, it could've happened at home. The location does not matter,' Richards said. 

According to Poison Control in Florida, calls about exposure to marijuana edibles have tripled in recent months and are on pace to be the record for last year.
