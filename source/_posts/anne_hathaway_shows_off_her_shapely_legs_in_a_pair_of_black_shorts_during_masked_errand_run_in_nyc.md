Anne paired her comfy shorts with a black flouncy top that featured long puff sleeves and a plunging neckline. 

She wore her hair down and parted to one side, while opting for little to no makeup. 

The Princess Diaries star proved she is drawn to a high price tag by slipping her feet into a pair of Valentino ballet flats, which often sell for close to $800.

Hathaway carried her essential belongings in a black leather tote that she held onto from the shortest strap.
