He's Byron Bay's most recognisable inhabitant.

So it was no surprise that Chris Hemsworth was asked to take a few selfies with fans as he enjoyed a low-key breakfast at the coastal town's popular Bayleaf Cafe on Wednesday, alongside his gorgeous wife Elsa Pataky.

The genetically-blessed pair opted to go completely barefoot for the casual outing, as they enjoyed each other's company in the Spring sunshine.

Chris, 37, didn't appear to look too fazed as he was approached by passers by, who beamed as they cosied up to the star for a quick photo.

Elsa, meanwhile, patiently stood nearby while her other half smiled for the shots.

The 44-year-old actress and fitness guru looked effortlessly chic in a heavy knit jumper and a flowing bohemian skirt. 

Spotted: An eager fan was quick to approach the actor for a selfie, after spotting the recognisable Hollywood star at the popular eatery

Snap happy! Chris was quickly stopped to take a photo with the passing fans, while his doting wife Elsa waited patiently beside them

Selfie time: The excited fan then went in for a selfie with the hunky Thor actor, while his wife Elsa swiftly walked on ahead

Less than impressed: Chris didn't appear to be too fazed with the request and politely obliged

She whisked her hair up into a stylish up-do, and appeared to be wearing minimal make-up to enhance her natural beauty.

Thor actor Chris, meanwhile, opted for a casual grey T-shirt and a pair of shorts.

Recently, Chris spoke out about the rumours that he would no longer be starring as Marvel superhero Thor, following the news that Natalie Portman is set to wield the mythical hammer in the next Thor film - set for release in 2022.

Gorgeous: Elsa looked stunning in her long skirt and jumper combo, and wore minimal make-up to emphasise her pretty features, while Chris opted for a more casual look

Excitement: Chris said he expected the film's script would be a huge hit with fans while speaking with the Philadelphia Inquirer in April this year

Speaking to Poland's Elle Man this month, Chris confirmed he won't be retiring his famous character after Thor: Love and Thunder.

'Are you crazy?! I'm not going into any retirement period,' he said.

'Thor is far too young for that. He's only 1,500 years old. It's definitely not a film that I say goodbye to this brand. At least I hope so.'

Chris said he expected the film's script would be a huge hit with fans while speaking with the Philadelphia Inquirer in April this year.

Sweet: The pair looked loved-up on their brief outing

Thrilled: Speaking about his return to Thor, Chris recently said 'It's one of the best scripts I've read in years'

'It's one of the best scripts I've read in years,' he told the publication.

'It's [director] Taika [Waititi] at his most extreme, and at his best. If the version I read is the one we get running with, it's going to be pretty insane.'

The movie, the fourth in the action franchise, reunites Hemsworth with Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman, and also features Christian Bale.

Chic: Elsa often wears floaty boho ensembles, and it was no different for her breakfast date on Wednesday
