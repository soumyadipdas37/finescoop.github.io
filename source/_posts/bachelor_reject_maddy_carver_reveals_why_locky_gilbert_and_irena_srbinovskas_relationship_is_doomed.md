Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska may be smitten now, but Bachelor reject Maddy Carver is convinced things won't last. 

Appearing on Hit Hobart's Jimmy & Nath this Thursday,  the 25-year-old schoolteacher said she believes Locky and Irena's relationship is genuine, but admitted she 'can't see them getting married.'  

'Locky had all these girls' attention inside the mansion,' Maddy reasoned. 

'It would be really hard to go back to life just having one girl': Bachelor reject Maddy Carver, 25, (pictured) told Hit Hobart's Jimmy & Nath on Thursday that she believes Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska's relationship is doomed  

'It would be really hard to go back to life just having one girl, don't you think?' she added. 

Maddy's claims may come as a surprise to fans who watched last week's Bachelor finale, which saw Locky dub Irena his 'future wife and baby-mumma'.  

Despite her dire prediction, Maddy had nothing but praise for nurse Irena, telling Jimmy & Nath: 'I honestly don't think Irena has a bad bone in her body.'

'She was the mother of the house. She was the one that was cleaning, she was the one that was cooking,' gushed the blonde. 

'The nights that some people didn't feel well she'd be 'nurse Irena', and she'd get out her medical kit.... giving people Panadol if they needed it,'  she added.  

Maddy, who was rejected by Locky after failing to receive a single date or group date extension, also confirmed she is currently in a relationship.

'I'm loved up now!' she glowed.

'We've known each other for about six years and went on a date six years ago. We didn't click at all, and then [we] caught back up and this time something just clicked, and it just feels right,' she continued. 

Maddy refused to reveal the identity of her mystery man, but did divulge that he works as an accounts manager.
