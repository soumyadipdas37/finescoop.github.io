She has arrived in Milan for its bi-annual fashion week after wowing at Burberry's virtual London Fashion Week show last week.

And Joan Smalls oozed confidence as she strutted down the runway at the Salvatore Ferragamo fashion show on Saturday afternoon.

The model, 32, looked typically elegant in an orange turtleneck jumper, which she wore tucked into a white midi-skirt belted around her svelte midriff.

Joan layered the look with a white leather jacket which was covered in holes, while also teaming it with a pair of heeled shoes.

The Puerto Rican-born beauty carried a peach leather handbag down the catwalk and she showed off the accessory on the runway.

She wore her brunette locks swept back and opted for soft touches of make-up to highlight her natural beauty.

Joan is currently taking part in Milan Fashion Week, after wowing during London's virtual event last week.  

Milan is only one of the four fashion capitals that is hosting the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  

The city is hosting 23 shows over the next five days- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks.

Paris has 20 scheduled shows planned next week but coveted guest lists have been reduced dramatically, in keeping with strict socially distancing guidelines.

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Back in February, Georgia Armani cancelled his show in Milan as the virus began to sweep through the country. 

It comes just weeks after she appeared to have confirmed she is dating Henry Junior Chalhoub - a year after the pair were presumed to be 'just friends
