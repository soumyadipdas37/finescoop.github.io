A teenager accused of releasing a sex tape of herself with a star footballer after he allegedly turned down her request for a threesome will plead guilty.  

McKenzie Lorraine Robinson, 18, appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday charged with distributing the illegal vision.

The teenager is accused of sharing footage of herself engaged in an intimate act with the star Brisbane Broncos centre between June 14 and August 5 without his consent.

When she last appeared in court, a lawyer for Ms Robinson - who now uses the alias McKenziana Skye on social media - vowed to explain how the sex tape was leaked at a later court appearance.

But on Wednesday, solicitor Chelsea Waters instead asked for an extra two weeks to prepare the case. 

The court heard Ms Robinson can be expected to plead guilty to the charge. 

Defence lawyer Jason Jacobson previously insisted the teenager never meant for the video to circulate on social media.

Despite the embarrassment for the up-and-coming Bronco, Staggs was cleared of any wrongdoing by the NRL's integrity unit after the video was released

'It was not Ms Robinson that made this private video go public,' he told reporters outside court at her last scheduled appearance.

'That was never intended by her and she very much regrets that it did and she very much regrets the impact that it caused for Mr Staggs.

'There is an explanation as to how this happened and that will be put to the court at a later date.' 

Ms Robinson's matter is now scheduled to appear before the court again on October 16.

Ms Robinson, who has been the target of extensive trolling since video circulated, allegedly messaged the star footballer on Instagram and instigated the relationship.

Shortly after they began speaking online, the duo met up and slept together, and Robinson allegedly asked if she could film the sexual encounter.

She assured him she could be 'trusted', The Courier Mail previously reported.   

Staggs alleges Robinson, who describes herself as a 'holistic wellness coach,' repeatedly called and messaged him following their rendezvous. 



Robinson has so far refused to publicly comment on the allegations 

She allegedly also asked the NRL star if he would have a threesome with her and a friend, according to the publication.

Fed up with the alleged constant messages, Staggs reportedly asked the teen to stop contacting him just weeks before the video was released to the public.  

He made a complaint to police after the video surfaced, claiming it was released without his consent.

The 18-year-old has shared several scantily-clad photos of herself on social media, where she writes that she is 'dedicated to empowerment and love'.

'I am a (sic) empath and have a huge high energy connection to the universe through crystals, meditation, aromatherapy and oracle readings,' a post on her Instagram read.

Staggs' lawyer Dave Garratt previously told The Courier Mail his client praised Queensland Police for their handling of the matter.

'Mr Staggs is extremely embarrassed and disappointed that his private life has been brought into the public domain,' Mr Garratt said.

'It has caused embarrassment to him, his family and the club and he is hoping to put this behind him now and leave it with the authorities.'

Staggs was recently ruled out of the upcoming State of Origin match when he injured himself in the final game of the regular season
