Addison Rae became one of TikTok's most popular creators before striking up a friendship with Kourtney Kardashian.

And now the social media star is hinting she might join her famous friend on her reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Addison, 19, spoke with Entertainment Tonight on Friday and revealed that she would be open to making an appearance on KUWTK.

Up for it: Addison Rae, 19, said she'd be game for a Keeping Up With The Kardashians appearance with her pal Kourtney Kardashian, 41, during an Entertainment Tonight interview from Friday; shown in February

'I don't know. Who knows what the future kind of holds,' Rae said. 'I'm kind of just living life day by day and going through everything with a happy heart and humble mindset. It's all been really exciting. 

'A lot of stuff keeps continuing to be presented to me, which is super fun, and I think there's plenty of opportunities and exciting things coming up,' she continued. 

'I feel like, I'm really not a person to say no to anything, at any time, ever. I can never say no to anybody, let alone something that I'm actually interested in doing.'

Addison and Kourtney, 41, have documented their friendship on Instagram and in multiple TikTok videos, including some humorous clips that have them lip syncing to classic KUWTK clips.

Opportunities: 'A lot of stuff keeps continuing to be presented to me, which is super fun, and I think there's plenty of opportunities and exciting things coming up,' Addison said

Can't say no: 'I feel like, I'm really not a person to say no to anything, at any time, ever. I can never say no to anybody, let alone something that I'm actually interested in doing,' she said of appearing on the show

The TikTok star also opened up about the famous duo's relationship and how it has flourished throughout the pandemic despite their more than 20-year age difference.

'At the end of the day, I think friendships are just what you make them,' she explained. 

'What you have, like the time you spend with them, the things you enjoy doing. And if you have things in common, it just makes sense. I don't think that's anything to really judge people on. I feel like friendships can range from any age and I feel like everyone can relate to people in different ways.'

The age gap didn't stop the two from showing off their stunning figures in a bikini photoset posted to Instagram late last month. 

Nothing but a number: 'I feel like friendships can range from any age and I feel like everyone can relate to people in different ways,' she said of their 20-year age gap

'Kourtney and I just happen to have a great friendship, which is really fun,' Addison continued. 'She's been a great person to have in my life. She said in my YouTube video that I had great energy that she liked to be around. I think she has great energy as well and she has so much experience in her life that I can really just look at and kind of learn from.'

The social media star also expressed interest in having Kourtney and her mother Kris Jenner make an appearance on her Mama Knows Best podcast, which she hosts with her mother Sheri Easterling.

'I would totally love to have them on the show, I think it would be hilarious,' she gushed. 'I love Kourtney and Kris so much, and it would be really interesting to compare their relationship to ours.'

Addison recently modeled in her underwear to mark the one-year anniversary of Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims, which she shared to her Instagram page and graces a billboard in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.

Still amicable: Kourtney has been spending more time lately with her ex Scott Disick, following his breakup with Sofia Richie

In addition to hanging out with Addison, Kourtney has recently been spending more time with her ex Scott Disick, following his split from Sofia Richie.

The former couple originally met in 2006 at the Mexican home of Girls Gone Wild founder Joe Francis, but their relationship came to an end in 2015.

Scott kept up his co-parenting duties while dating the daughter of Lionel Richie, and the two would even take family vacations with Kourtney and the kids.

Now that he's single, the Flip It Like Disick star has been more present in his family's lives.

However, a source recently told TMZ that Scott and Kourtney 'are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia.' 

 'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple,' the source continued. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both.'
