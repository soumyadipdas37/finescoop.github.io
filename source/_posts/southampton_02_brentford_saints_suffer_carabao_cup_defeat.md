If Thomas Frank’s casual get-up and depleted bench suggested the Carabao Cup is an afterthought for Brentford, this performance proved these Bees still harbour dreams of another unlikely trip to Wembley.

Injuries and a positive coronavirus test meant Frank – in polo shirt and shorts – named only five substitutes for this clash at St Mary’s.

But the 16 who made the trip still had too much for a full-strength Southampton, whose new campaign has begun with successive defeats.

Josh Dasilva doubled the advantage for Brentford as they saw off the Premier League side

Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl watched a full strength team lose at home 

Nathan Redmond suffered a serious looking injury and was forced to come off 

Christian Norgaard celebrated the opening goal of the game with his Brentford team-mates

West Brom await Frank’s side in round three after first-half goals from Christian Norgaard and Josh Dasilva on Wednesday night.

The Baggies pipped Brentford to promotion so a trip to the Hawthorns offers a chance at revenge of sorts.

For Southampton, no such mercies.

Norgaard headed in during the first half as Thomas Frank's side set about their work well 

Danny Ings went close for his side but the former Liverpool man found himself frustrated

Thomas Frank cut a casual figure on the touchline but his team played with plenty of panache

Danny Ings, Che Adams and Jack Stephens all went close but Brentford had chances too before Norgaard headed home his first Bees goal.

Their lead should have doubled when Bryan Mbeumo raced clear and beyond the onrushing Alex McCarthy, only to be denied by Ryan Bertrand.

There was, however, nothing Saints could do to stem the pinball move which culminated in Dasilva firing home from the edge of the box.

And nothing Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side could do thereafter to turn the tide.      

Southampton are out of the Carabao Cup and Brentford have advanced to the next round
