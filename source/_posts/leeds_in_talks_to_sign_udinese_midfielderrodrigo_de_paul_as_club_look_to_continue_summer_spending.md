Leeds United are in talks with Udinese over a deal for £30million rated Rodrigo de Paul.

The Argentina international is a skilful attacking midfielder with an eye for a pass and has drawn enquiries from both Milan clubs.

However, he is tempted by the prospect of playing in the Premier League for compatriot Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds are negotiating to try and agree a fee for the 26-year old.

Leeds United have opened in talks to sign Udinese midfielder Rodrigo De Paul this summer

The 26-year-old was previously linked with Juventus and could demand a fee of £27million 

Leeds signed defender Robin Koch from Freiburg and forward Rodrigo from Valencia over the weekend and would still like to add two more.  

De Paul managed seven goals and seven assists in all competitions last season and netted nine times in the previous campaign.

The 26-year-old can play any of the midfield roles and would offer Bielsa's side versatility.

De Paul has 17 caps for Argentina and is capable of playing anywhere across the midfield

He also has 17 caps for Argentina but is yet to score his first international goal.

Leeds have been busy in the transfer market with the club determined to ensure they remain in the top flight after a 16-year wait to return.

As well as Rodrigo and Koch, the club have added several promising youngsters including Sam Greenwood, Dani van den Hueval, Charlie Allen, Cody Drameh and Joe Gelhardt.
