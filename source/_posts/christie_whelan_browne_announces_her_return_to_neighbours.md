Christie went on to explain she filmed her first scenes while five weeks pregnant. 

'It was pretty amazing to think my baby was making a debut on one of Australia's most iconic shows while only a tiny embryo,' the star told the publication.

'That's something he can brag about to the other babies in the nursery at the hospital when he is born,' she continued.
