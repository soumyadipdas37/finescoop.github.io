The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert makes no secret of the fact he is a keen adventurer and wants to share his love of the great outdoors with his future partner.

And a wild rumour surfaced this week that Irena Srbinovska, who is the bookies' favourite to win the show, has been pretending to enjoy hiking to impress the former Australian Survivor star.

During Wednesday's episode, the 31-year-old nurse told Locky she liked bushwalking in her spare time - but this was disputed by her rival Bella Varelis.

Rumours: The Bachelor's Irena Srbinovska (pictured) has been rocked by a wild theory that she is faking her love of hiking and the outdoors to impress Locky Gilbert

While Bella's skepticism may have simply been the result of jealousy, her claim that Irena was being disingenuous about her love of hiking hasn't gone unnoticed.

On Thursday, former contestant Alisha Aitken-Radburn said on Channel 10's official Cocktails and Roses podcast that she doubted Irena's sincerity, too.

Alisha noticed while stalking Irena's Instagram account that she had conspicuously shared two hiking-themed posts in May - when Locky and the women were all under lockdown and staying in contact via Zoom, texts and FaceTime.

On-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from March until the first week of July due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Alisha suggested that Irena's posts were a strategic attempt to catch Locky's eye at a time when he had 10 different women trying to impress him.

She added: 'I do think that she was doing a bit of positioning. You know, Locky's just at home sussing out his future wife - we haven't determined exactly which one it will be yet - and if you see, you know... tick for Irena!'

Hmm! Alisha singled out this post from May 19 that showed Irena climbing over rocks in Mount Macedon, Victoria, as evidence that she was conspicuously trying to get Locky's attention

Alisha hastened to add, however, that Irena has shared photos of herself on country walks dating back several years.

Her podcast co-host Osher Günsberg replied with a laugh: 'Well played, Irena!'

Irena is the current bookies' favourite to win Locky's heart on The Bachelor, with 25-year-old marketing consultant Bella tipped for runner-up.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
