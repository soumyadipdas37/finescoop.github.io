Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and her new TikTok star BFF Addison Rae, 19, paid a visit to Miley Cyrus' Midnight Sky truck on Monday. 

The two donned matching black mini dresses as they rode the disco ball and enjoyed the mirrored room. 

Miley launched a mobile experience in honor of her latest single Midnight Sky, which she just performed at the VMAs on Sunday riding a disco ball.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star and the young creator posed on the large disco ball in the middle of the room, as Kourtney gripped the tick chain. 

They wore matching black mini dresses in a body-con style and slick long ponytails.

Surrounding them was purple lighting, wall to wall mirrors and disco balls down the walls and across the ceiling. 

Kourtney and Addison went barefoot while enjoying the unique Midnight Sky truck and posing on the disco ball. 

Swinging: The mother-of-three took her opportunity to ride the disco ball and flaunt her figure in the mini dress. She saddled the chain and threw her head back letting her dark ponytail hanging behind her

Kourtney has been getting close to the top earning TikTok creator in recent months after she filmed TikTok videos with her oldest son Mason, 10. 

The two have been spending time at Kourtney's homes in Calabasas, Malibu and Palm Springs.

'I've had such an amazing time spending time with Kourtney and meeting the family,' Addison gushed to E! News earlier this month.   

'They're all just such loving people that genuinely care about each other. That just continuously inspires me. They all have such an amazing bond that I always valued in my family. 

'So it really just makes me love them even more as people, because not everyone gets to see every second. It just really shows you how genuine they are. It's not all just for the show, it's how they really are.' 

Miley performed her latest single Midnight Sky at the VMAs swinging on a giant disco ball, in scenes reminiscent of her 2013 song Wrecking Ball, and the performance seemed to inspire the truck's theme.
