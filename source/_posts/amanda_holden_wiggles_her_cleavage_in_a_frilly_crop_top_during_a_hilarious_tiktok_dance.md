She's set to release her album Songs From The Heart next Friday.

And Amanda Holden seemed to be getting into the party spirit a little early as she celebrated the weekend and 'wiggled' her cleavage in a hilarious TikTok clip.

The BGT judge, 49, looked sensational as she showed off her moves after jumping out of her car and grooving to complete the It's Friday Again challenge.

Work it! Amanda Holden had her fans in a fluster after she 'wiggled' her cleavage during a cheeky TikTok clip on Friday

Amanda is first seen sitting in the car's passenger seat and starts to nod her head and bounce her assets as the music kicks in.

She then jumps out of the vehicle and starts dancing, running backwards and throwing out some jazz hands before shimmying her cleavage.   

The singer and presenter could be seen grinning throughout her cheeky routine and was clearly enjoying her start to the weekend.

Amanda exuded style in a burnt orange co-ord which boasted an off-the-shoulder frilly top with puffed sleeves.

Grooving: The star looked sensational in an orange crop top with frills around the bust and started her funny video sitting in the car

Go girl! She showed off her moves and flaunted her ample assets to the camera

She completed her look with some matching high-waist trousers to accentuate her svelte figure and also donned a pair of chic sunglasses.

After Amanda shared the clip, one of her fan accounts posted it to their Instagram Story, saying: 'Stop distracting me by wiggling your breasts @NoHoldenBack'.

The account then playfully added: '(Please don't stop)'

Other fans were also impressed, with Amanda's TikTok being watched more than 1m timed and her receiving over 700 comments. 

Flustered: Amanda's fans quickly reposed the clip and joked that she was 'distracting' them by 'wiggling her breasts' in the cheeky TikTok clip 

Entertaining: Others also enjoyed the video, saying that Amanda had 'cracked them up'

One person said: 'You crack me up! Love your energy and positivity’

While another added: 'Loving the hype from who’s driving and the people in the background'.

The cheeky video comes after Amanda revealed her album Songs From The Heart is set for release next week.

In a sizzling image shared to Instagram on Friday, the presenter turned up the heat as she raised her legs in the air in cover art for her upcoming LP.

'It's a collection of my favourite musical and film sound tracks, what's your favourite song from the album?' 

The TV star has been busy filling in for Simon Cowell as head judge on Britain's Got Talent, yet still found time to squeeze in some much needed relaxation time as she enjoyed a romantic getaway to Cliveden House in Berkshire last weekend.
