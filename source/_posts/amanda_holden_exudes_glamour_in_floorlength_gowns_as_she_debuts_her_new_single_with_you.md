Amanda Holden debuted her new single With You on YouTube on Thursday.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, exuded glamour as she performed the song on stage in an empty theatre wearing a sequinned gown, before walking through woodland.

Amanda told Lorraine, which was released on Friday, the song from the musical Ghost is in memory of her son Theo, who was tragically stillborn in 2011.

Amanda told the host: 'It's a song about grief and loss. It's a very moving song. My whole album means so much for me. 

'My husband Chris actually told me that the last two lines (You took my life with you/ Took my world with you) of the song really remind him of how we felt when we lost Theo.' 

'Chris is a stoic man, he never took time for himself when we lost Theo so it just floored me. It's on the album and very emotional.'

'That is a part of me but really I'm all about my family. This album is all the songs I've loved in my life, sung for the people who mean the most to me. It's a very emotional album that everyone can relate to.

'I had a tape recorder as a little girl and would sing into it dreaming of this moment. There is a story behind every song on the album, celebrating life, love and loss - the darkest and happiest moments in my life so far. It is literally my heart laid bare.'
