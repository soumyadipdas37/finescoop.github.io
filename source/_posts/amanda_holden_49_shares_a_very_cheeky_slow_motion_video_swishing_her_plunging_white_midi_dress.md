The TV personality shares the property with her record producer husband of 12 years, Chris Hughes, and their two daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight. 

The Britain's Got Talent host has made the most of her daughters' old playhouse by transforming it into an incredible comfy home for her two rabbits Princess and Beatrice. 

Amanda is thought to have spent £6,000 to up-cycle the space for her beloved pets who can now enjoy their own porch and bunk beds, reports The Sun.

A source said: 'Amanda loves these rabbits, and they're treasured members of the family. It's only right they live like starlets.' 

And a representative for Amanda told MailOnline: 'The playhouse was purchased 6 years ago for Lexi and Hollie to play in, but they’ve outgrown it now.  

'Converting it into a home for the rabbits has cost just £200. Rather than dismantling it, Amanda has simply recycled it!'
