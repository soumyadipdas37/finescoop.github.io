Francesca added a touch of glitz to her look with a pair metallic silver trainers, while showcasing her penchant for designer goods with a simple black Prada bag.

The reality star wore her brunette locks in a bouncy blown out style, while enhancing her striking looks with a full coat of make-up in neutral shades.

She was seen chatting away on her mobile phone as she left the premises. 

Francesca's boutique is a joint venture with her sister Claudia Allen, who also designs jewellery for her business French Fashion House.

Over the summer months Francesca enjoyed several holidays and her Instagram was littered with sizzling bikini snaps.

Aside from her frequent getaways, Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London earlier this summer.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday.

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner.

In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is currently dating Dan Edgar.

The accomplished businessman was named vice chairman of his father's company in January and is featured on the company's website.

His working title is described on the website as: 'Edward joined the family business in 2007, starting as a machine driver and has worked in various roles within the company to now being a director overseeing the development of the business.'

MailOnline contacted Francesca's representatives for further comment at the time of publication.
