Jamie Carragher admitted he was surprised by the standard of Manchester City's performance after their win against Wolves on Monday night. 

Goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus secured a 3-1 victory against a side who beat them twice last season.  

It means Pep Guardiola's side, who started the Premier League season late due to their European exploits in the last campaign, are off and running with three points and ex-Liverpool defender Carragher was suitably impressed.

'I thought City would lose tonight just for the fact it was the first game,' Carragher told Sky Sports.

'United were sluggish first game, Liverpool and Spurs as well. But the way they came out with the energy in the first half it was a real sort of statement really but I thought City were outstanding in the first half. 

'How they dealt with the game at 2-1 - 78 minutes gone you’d have thought there’d be a couple of chances for Wolves, but they only had one shot really. '

Carragher also said he would only put Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in a clear bracket ahead of De Bruyne, who once again shone at Molineux. 

'I would put him [De Bruyne] top of that second band of players behind Messi and Ronaldo,' Carragher added.

Kevin De Bruyne won and then scored the first-half penalty which sent City on their way 

It was an excellent start for Pep Guardiola's side as they look to reclaim the league title

'He’s a manger’s dream. He can play in the No 10 position, he can play right of a three and even speaking to Roberto Martinez he plays him central midfield for Belgium. 

'He will have great longevity in his career because I still think he’d have that ability to play that deep role maybe when his legs go a little bit because he’s got a great engine. 

'His passing ability is possibly as good as anything we’ve ever seen in the Premier League and he could play that role when he’s in his mid-thirties no problem.'
