Leicester have completed the signing of defender Timothy Castagne from Atalanta in a deal worth £22million. 

The 24-year-old, who has traditionally played as a right back but can also operate from the left, has penned a five-year deal with the Foxes. 

A Belgian international with seven caps, Castagne has been brought in by Brendan Rodgers following the sale of Ben Chilwell to Chelsea last week for £50m.
