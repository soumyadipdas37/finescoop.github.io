An Oxford-educated cancer doctor nicknamed 'God' is facing a disciplinary hearing amid allegations that he gave inappropriate treatment to terminally ill patients in a bid to extend their life.

Cancer expert Professor Justin Stebbing, 49, is accused of having 'failed to provide good clinical care' to 11 people between March 2014 and March 2017.

The doctor is often called on by extraordinarily-wealthy cancer sufferers from around the globe and has a reputation for being 'aggressive' in his treatment plans - even when a patient is near to death.

Professor Stebbing - who treated New Zealand multi-millionaire Sir Douglas Myers and Doctor Who actress Lynda Bellingham - is a cancer medicine and oncology professor at Imperial College London and has a private Harley Street office.

Oxford-educated cancer doctor Professor Justin Stebbing, 49, is facing a disciplinary hearing amid allegations that he gave inappropriate treatment to terminally ill patients in a bid to extend their life

One accusation claims he suggested 'open-ended platinum doublet chemotherapy' to a patient, even though this was 'unsupported by clinical evidence' and fell 'outside national guidelines'. 

Another claims he backdated insurance documents.

He allegedly falsely claimed a meeting between colleagues had taken place prior to him signing off a Bupa insurance application for cancer drug funding. 

He also gave £19,500-per-dose pembrolizumab to a patient while there was 'no evidence of any response to the treatment', the allegations reported by The Times claim.

Another patient had their treatment 'ceiling' increased by  Professor Stebbing - who did not speak to his colleagues first.

That same patient had their 'do not resuscitate' instruction removed by the doctor without him consulting his fellows beforehand.

The professor was suspended from certain leading private health insurers' lists of recognised consultants in the midst of worries about certain drugs he was giving to patients.

The accusations came after a General Medical Council investigation.

On the other hand, those backing the expert have highlighted the  fact that Sir Douglas stayed alive for four years after spending thousands of pounds on Professor Stebbing's treatment.  

The tycoon was given just weeks to live prior to the pair's first meeting.

Ms Bellingham lived for an extra 15 months after his treatment.

Today, a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service continued in Manchester. It will resume on several days until March 2021. 

Professor Stebbing has been approached for comment.
