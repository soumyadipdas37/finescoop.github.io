She famously opened the doors to her Kylie Cosmetics headquarters last year in a lengthy YouTube video. 

Yet Kylie Jenner's tour was given a hilarious update on Tuesday as comedian Steff Todd dubbed the video with a Yorkshire accent. 

Imagining how things would be if Kylie was in a fact a British northerner, the entrepreneur was seen showing off her Miss Leeds award, discussing her past job at Superdrug and checking in on her baby, Chardonnay.

Hilarious: Kylie Jenner's famous video tour of Kylie Cosmetics HQ was given a hilarious update on Tuesday as comedian Steff Todd dubbed the video with a Yorkshire accent

Dubbing the new audio over Kylie's original video, the clip began: 'Hiya, I'm Kylie. I recently won 20 grand on a scratch card and I thought I'm going to set up my own makeup business. 

'I used to work at Superdrug but they've been doing my head in for ages not treating me right so I thought I'm going to rival them and I bought a warehouse on the outskirts of Leeds. Now lets go on a little tour!'

'First things first, hand sanitiser. I don't know about you but this corona's doing my head in.'

As the clip cut to Kylie showing off the company's lobby and staff, Yorkshire Kylie said: 'There's Julie, that's me mum, works on reception'.

Gesturing at two more staff members, she added: 'What the heck are them two doing in here? They're work experience, don't film them for god's sake!' 

Picking up a pink umbrella she continued: 'I've even got branded umbrellas cause obviously it's always chucking it down. Help yourself if you want one!' 

Standing over her immaculately displayed counter top, she went on: 'Got all my makeup laid out there, looks good doesn't it. 

'Obviously I didn't do it, got one of me workers to do it, Sue. Shout out to Sue!' 

Savvy: Dubbing the new audio over Kylie's original video, the clip began, 'Hiya, I'm Kylie. I won 20 grand on a scratch card and I thought I'm going to set up my own makeup business'

The tour then took viewers into Kylie's personal office, where Kylie's business awards had been given a little twist. 

She explained: 'This is my little office where I like to keep some of my little awards. Miss Leeds!

'Champagne machine got one of them - you won't find that in Superdrug!' 

Waving at a coworker, Yorkshire Kylie quipped, 'She's getting fired soon, she's so bad'. 

She continued: 'I used to work at Superdrug but they've been doing my head in for ages not treating me right so I thought I'm going to rival them and I bought a warehouse in Leeds'

The video concluded with Kylie walking into her daughter Stormi's on-site nursery room, as Yorkshire Kylie bellowed: 'Last room, follow me. 

'This is my little lasses room Chardonnay. Wake up you lazy git!' 

Steff left her followers in hysterics with the clip, with the Twitter video racking up more than 2900 retweets and 12,300 likes in less than 24 hours. 

Last year, Kylie sent her fans wild when she gave them a first look inside her office.   

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star gave her devoted followers an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look of her company in a YouTube video, in which she was joined by her beloved daughter Stormi.

For her tour, Kylie was dressed in a long-sleeve, black Chanel dress and accessorized with a necklace featuring her lipkit logo.

During the 16 minute video, Kylie showed off all the touches in the building - including a playroom, self-portraits and personalised sweets.
