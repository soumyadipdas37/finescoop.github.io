An archery hunter has been gored to death by an enraged elk in Oregon. 

Mark David, 66, shot at and wounded the elk with a bow and arrow the night before in Trask Road area, Tillamook County.  

David, from Hillsboro, had been hunting on private property when he fired at the bull elk but failed to kill the animal on Saturday night.

In Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park has warned visitors to be wary of randy elks during mating season, which runs from early September to mid-October. 

During this time, male elks are prone to having horn-clashing battles with each other as they attempt to impress their potential partners. 

In a tweet, the park warned that bull elks can be 'extremely dangerous'. 

'WARNING: The elk rut has begun in Yellowstone National Park. Bull elk can be extremely dangerous during this time. You are responsible for your own safety,' they said.
