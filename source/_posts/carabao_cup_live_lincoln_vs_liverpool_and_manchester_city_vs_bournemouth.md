Another night of Carabao Cup action brings another opportunity for a giant killing and none would be more shocking than if League One minnows Lincoln City could spring an upset against the Premier League champions Liverpool.

Jurgen Klopp's men have made a perfect start to the season but could rest some of their star players as they travel to the LNER Stadium tonight with a place in the fourth-round up for grabs.

Elsewhere, Manchester City will welcome Bournemouth while Aston Villa make the trip south to take on Bristol City.
