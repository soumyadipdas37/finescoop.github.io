Australians are creating 'shadow boxes' filled with gift cards, chocolate and alcohol to give as presents to those who are 'difficult' to buy for, and the results are impressive.

Kmart's shadow box frames are designed to display treasured memories children's creations, but they have quickly found a secondary use as a budget gift idea.

With Father's Day fast approaching Down Under families are placing some of dad's favourite treats into the $10 box in preparation, with chocolates, scratchies, tiny vials of alcohol and travel size toiletries the additions of choice.

There are hundreds of examples on Facebook for those unsure of what to place inside, with many using it to surprise teenage sons and daughters.

'This is the first shadow box I've done for my son's 13th birthday. He was most disappointed when he thought he got a picture frame, but delighted when he turned it over and saw all of the treats inside,' one mother shared online.

'These are just some of the shadow box frames that I have done for our two children, husband and three of our nieces. They all loved them. Such a great gift, no matter the budget or occasion,' another said.

Chocolate and cash were popular present choices inside of the shadow box

The gifts were still personalised with products the receiver would like 

Some people used sticky tape to pin the items to the back of the box, so everything didn't move around

* Find out the person's favourite chocolate bars and purchase a few of them.

* Use gift cards to make up 'holes' or spaces in the box.

* Concert tickets, makeup and toiletries are 'useful' gifts for people.

* Cash is always a welcome sight and can be used as another space filler.

* Perfume, notebooks, lip balm and jewellery accessories are also a touching gift.

* Video games are often included, as are card games. 

Some parents hid a car key in their children's shadow box - as a surprise for what was waiting outside - while others used it to stock up on makeup or jewellery.  

Concert tickets, swimwear, perfume, notebooks and cards could also be arranged in the box, although some cautioned that it requires 'more patience than you realise'.

'First and last shadow box for my 12-year-old birthday boy... It took more patience then I expected to line everything up without anything moving around,' one lady said.

The finishing touches usually include adding letters or a message to the outside of the frame or fairy lights placed carefully inside.

While the original shadow box from Kmart can be difficult to find because it's regularly out of stock, some clever customers have improvised with regular photo frames and jewellery boxes

Can't find a shadow box? Never fear, some people just picked up a bigger photo frame and put flat products in it

Some didn't even put presents inside and just used the box as a card

While the original shadow box from Kmart can be difficult to find because it's regularly out of stock, some clever customers have improvised with regular photo frames and jewellery boxes.  

'I finally got my hands on a shadow box and have decided to fill it with 'emergency supplies' for a mother-to-be... these boxes really can be used for any event, and I spent less than $100 putting it together,' one woman said.

'The shadow box was perfect for a last minute put-together present for my mum. Nothing extravagant as times are tough at the moment, but her reaction to it was the best present,' said another.
