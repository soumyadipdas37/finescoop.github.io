Two of Australia's largest liquor retailers have launched a massive recruitment drive as they advertise 1,600 new jobs in a bid to keep up with summer demand.

With a record 1.45million Australians on JobSeeker during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dan Murphy's alone is looking to hire more than 1,000 casual team members starting as soon as possible.

The chain said the impact of COVID-19 on shopping habits means they need more staff to man their direct-to-boot pick up and contactless delivery services.

BWS is meanwhile advertising for more than 600 staff to work in its stores across metro and regional Australia.

To apply for a Dan Murphy’s job, prospective applicants can enter the stores within commuting distance of their availability at My Career Dan Murphy’s. 

Dan Murphy’s Head of Culture & People Siobhan Pelc said the roles on offer would be ideal for university students on a summer break or those who have a background in hospitality.

'If there is a Dan Murphy’s near you, then that store is looking for Customer Assistants who can start as soon as possible or in the coming weeks and months,' Ms Pelc said.

Applicants need to be at least 18 years of age and have a valid RSA to apply. 

Both BWS and Dan Murphy's have brought in new measures since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to minimise contact in their stores.

Dan Murphy's has introduced plexiglass screens at checkouts, signage to aid social distancing and strict limits on the number of customers allowed inside at once.

Earlier this month, the chain unveiled its first-ever high-tech drive-thru bottle shop - promising a speedy service for customers who want to skip the queue.

The booze retailer's first drive-thru opened at Manly Vale on Sydney's northern beaches, with the service expected to roll out to more outlets across Australia in the next 12 months.

Australians can expect to be served in record time with the direct-to-boot service allowing drivers to be in and out in less than three minutes with their orders.

The process is very simple - customers place their order online, then enter their registration number at point of order, and when they arrive at the drive-thru, digital cameras alert the team members, who then place the order in their car boot.

To apply for a BWS job, applicants can either register in the store or online through Wow Careers and search for BWS.
