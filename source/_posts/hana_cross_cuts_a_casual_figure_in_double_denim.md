She is is one of the fashion industry's most promising up and coming models.

And Hana Cross, 23, cut a casual figure in black double denim as she stepped out for an evening at celebrity hot spot Chiltern Firehouse in London on Saturday night. 

The ex-girlfriend of Brooklyn Beckham, 21, offered a glimpse of her washboard abs in the low-rise black jeans as she left the luxury Marylebone hotel.

She paired her laid-back look with a lacy white bralette featuring ribbon detailing for the night out and draped a jacket adorned with badges over her shoulders. 

Styling her brunette locks in sleek waves, Hana added detailing to her tresses with neat plaited braids around her face. 

The model accentuated her flawless complexion with a dash of highlighter over her cheekbones and a rose lip for the outing with her friend.

Brooklyn, 21, and Hana called it quits last year after eight months of dating in the wake of a string of explosive public rows.  

Back in September, reports surfaced Victoria and David were relieved when the couple split.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Brooklyn and Hana have called off their romance for good. David and Victoria very glad and relieved and are backing him 100 per cent.'

Hana has since moved on from her turbulent romance with Brooklyn and is dating Nasser Alfallah, who is a Loyola Marymount University student in Los Angeles and is originally from Kuwait. 

And according to The Sun, the influencer is said to have started recording her debut album with savage lyrics believed to be about her ex - who got engaged to American actress Nicole Peltz, 25, last month - and their failed romance.  

The website reports that in the track, Hana sings: 'I wish that someone told me you had a habit for dishonesty . . . though you break my heart, I want to stay.' 

A source added to the publication: 'She is still raw from her split with Brooklyn and it pains her to see him so happy.  

'Her record has a few heartbreak songs and she isn't afraid of expressing how she feels.'

They added that it is best that Brooklyn 'steers clear' of the record when it comes out.  

MailOnline contacted both Brooklyn's and Hana's representatives for comment at the time.
