Manchester City have confirmed that Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte have tested positive for coronavirus. 

Both players will now undergo a period of self-isolation and the club confirmed that neither players are showing any symptoms of the virus. 

Though the Premier League returns this Saturday, Pep Guardiola's side travel to Molineux to face Wolves in their season-opener on September 21, meaning the pair's involvement in that clash is now in some doubt.

Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte have tested positive for coronavirus

The two positive tests will be a concern for manager Pep Guardiola ahead of the new season

The pair will observe a period of self-isolation, with City's first game back in two weeks time

The positive tests will be of concern to the Premier League generally though, with the new season starting this Saturday, September 12.  

City said in a statement: 'Manchester City FC can confirm that Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte have tested positive for Covid-19.

'Both players are currently observing a period of self-isolation in accordance with Premier League and UK Government protocol on quarantine. Neither is displaying symptoms of the virus.

'Everyone at the Club wishes Riyad and Aymeric a speedy recovery ahead of their return to training and the new season.'
