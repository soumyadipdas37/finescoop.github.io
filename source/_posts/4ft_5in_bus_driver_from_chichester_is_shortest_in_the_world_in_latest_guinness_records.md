A key worker from Hampshire has broken the Guinness World Record for shortest bus driver, measuring 4ft 5.6 inches in height.

Frank Faeek Hachem drove a regular car for more than 20 years, but in 2017 decided to take his bus driving test.

The 57-year-old, originally from Iraq, works in Chichester, West Sussex. The married father-of-two has achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism, but he has never let his height hold him back.

With no special modifications required for his bus, all he has to do is adjust the seat and steering wheel before setting off on his route.

He hopes that by achieving the title and showing he is able to perform the same job as anyone else, he can inspire others to believe in themselves and 'not give up'. 

Mr Hachem is just one of a group of new world record-holders, revealed by Guinness with the launch of the 2021 book of records.

British record holders also include Marco George, who doubled the previous record for fastest speed on a motorcycle while performing a headstand at 122.59km/h

Speaking moments after setting the record, the daredevil said: 'I don't know what happened, I just clicked into the next gear of what I normally do and managed to pull a 76. I feel amazing and relieved'

A spokesperson for Guinness World Records said: 'Frank loves meeting different people every day and helping serve his community: it's a source of pride for him, especially as a key worker in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.'

British record holders also include Marco George, who doubled the previous record for fastest speed on a motorcycle while performing a headstand at 76.17mph.

Frankie now holds a new record for the most high-fives with alternate paws in 30 seconds , at 28

Luke, 29, a project manager in the NHS, gave the rats sweetcorn to keep them motivated as they strove to fulfil their gnawing ambition

The two-year-old rat brothers Frankie and Freddie spent 15 minutes training every day for eight weeks to master their skills.

Luke, 29, a project manager in the NHS, gave the rats sweetcorn to keep them motivated as they strove to fulfil their gnawing ambition. 

Mr Roberts, engaged to GP Jessica Timmis, 31, said: 'Each time you go for a record you get a rush of adrenaline. It felt superb to set these two new ones.

'I trained Frankie and Freddie. You can train rats in a similar way to dogs through positive reinforcement.

Edward Nino Hernandez from Bogota, Colombia, broke the record for the shortest living man, at 72.1 cm (2 ft 4.38 in) 

Jericho, owned by Hugh and Melodee Smith, also from the US, has the longest horns on a yak - 136.4in (346.4cm)

Paul Scardino from the US has an unusual hobby which has landed him a place in the record books after amassing the largest collection of Funko Pop! figurines (5.306)

'You break down desired behaviour into easily obtainable steps and reinforce behaviours at each step - which meant giving them half a kernel of sweetcorn.'

Mr Roberts, who with Miss Timmis has previously set a world record for the most party poppers popped by a team of two in 30 seconds (51), added: 'We like trying for fun records.

'Rats aren't everyone's cup of tea, but they are very intelligent, intelligent and affectionate. My fiancée gives them lots of love.'
