Australian chef Mitch Orr has accused Gordon Ramsay of 'stealing' one of his signature dishes.

The outspoken British chef uploaded a video to Instagram last week of himself making a Vietnamese braised pork carbonara served with an egg yolk.

Mr Orr claims the recipe was an exact replica of his one of his dishes - macaroni, pig's head and egg yolk - once served at his former Rushcutters Bay restaurant  ACME.

He commented on Ramsay's post, saying: 'Looks familiar mate,' which instantly drew support from the hospitality industry.

Mr Orr said that while chefs and cooks don't own recipes, it is 'standard etiquette to give credit where credit is due'.

'Gordon is one of the biggest chefs in the world with over 9 million followers on social media – the right thing to do is to credit where the inspiration for the dish came from,' told Emerald City.

Mr Orr reached out to Ramsay's employee, chef Michael Dabbs, who was tagged in the post. 

'I haven't heard anything from Gordon himself, but I have been in contact with the chef he tagged who agreed the [pasta] was too similar not to have given me credit for,' Mr Orr said.

Mr Orr closed ACME last year before going to work at CicciaBella in Bondi. He left in May and hasn't revealed what the next step in his career will be.
