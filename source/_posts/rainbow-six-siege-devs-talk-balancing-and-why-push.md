Ubisoft has clarified its stance on balancing Rainbow Six Siege for the game's professional players, specifically what it meant by earlier stating, "if professional players are not happy with our proposed features, then that means we are going in the right direction." In a blog post for the in-game Operator adjustments in update Y5S1.2, Ubisoft said it merely wanted to convey that it's the developer's job to push Siege's playerbase out of its comfort zone on occasion.

"It is true that part of our balancing efforts is to push every player, professionals included, out of their comfort zone," Ubisoft wrote. "This does not mean we are going about things to be intentionally frustrating for these players, but instead make adjustments to ensure our professional players are the best at the game as a whole, and not a specific update or meta. We also have to consider the entire player-base, and while some aspects of professional play will trickle down to general matchmaking, not all do (Goyo for example)."
