She is currently acting as the Jury President for the 77th annual Venice Film Festival.

And Cate Blanchett was sure to turn heads as she arrived in style at the event for the Di Yi Lu Xiang (Love After Love) premiere in the Italian city on Tuesday.

The Thor: Ragnarok star, 51, exuded elegance in an androgynous chic look that paired a puffy white dress with a simple black blazer.

Wow! Cate Blanchett exuded elegance in a puffy white dress and a black blazer as she arrived in style at the Di Yi Lu Xiang premiere at the 77th Venice Film Festival on Tuesday

Cate's ensemble featured asymmetrical peplum tulle skirt across her torso, while her blazer also had a matching white material on one shoulder to complement the look.

The evening gown also had silver floral embroidery across the front to give her look a glamorous flourish as she stepped out onto the red carpet.

Cate boosted her statuesque figure in a pair of black heels, and chose to keep her accessories to a minimum so that all attention remained on her outfit. 

The actor brushed her golden locks into a sleek, straight style, and embraced her natural beauty by wearing a light palette of make-up.

Cate's outing comes after she revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'. 

Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor. 

'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'

Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she added of her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.' 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It starts on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.

Greeting: Cate met with the film's director Ann Hui on the red carpet, and the pair enjoyed an elbow bump by way of greeting amid the coronavirus crisis
