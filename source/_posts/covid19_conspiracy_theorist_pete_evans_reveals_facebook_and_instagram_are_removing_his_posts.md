Coronavirus denier Pete Evans has revealed that social media platforms Facebook and Instagram are removing posts and pages which share his same dangerous beliefs. 

The 47-year-old made the admission in a post shared to his Instagram on Wednesday, where he encouraged his fans to follow him on the messaging app, Telegram, to see his posts instead.

The former My Kitchen Rules judge, who actively spreads harmful and worrying conspiracies about COVID-19, wrote: 'It seems that fb [Facebook] and insta [Instagram] are removing more and more pages by the day.'

His post continued: 'Thank you to all the people that have jumped on to telegram to follow. I post a lot of different information on there.

'It seems that fb and insta are removing more and more pages by the day and there are some new rules just announced for October which is going to make it a lot more interesting,' he added. 

This comes after Pete seemingly contradicted himself by providing a 'COVID Safe' disclaimer on the website of his 'healing clinic' in Byron Bay.

The disclaimer states that the clinic is committed to high standards of hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic - which Evans supposedly believes is fake.

Pete's Facebook account and his Evolve with Pete Evans podcast also feature similar disclaimers, which state that Evans is not a health professional and that people should consult qualified medical experts instead.

Interestingly, the disclaimer on his podcast states that Evans 'does not endorse' the 'opinions and conclusions' of the guests he openly praises and agrees with. 

Evans' harmful views have ranged from blaming coronavirus on 5G cell towers to actively encouraging his followers to not wear masks in Melbourne, which is currently in stage-four lockdown.

Evans' false and unscientific views about the coronavirus pandemic cost him his $800,000-a-year job at Channel Seven earlier this year. 

He and his wife, New Zealand glamour model Nicola Robinson, are now preparing to open their Evolve Health Labs clinic in Australia's hippie capital.

Despite believing the pandemic is a hoax, the former TV star is still complying with the New South Wales government by registering his business as COVID-safe. 

According to the company's Instagram account, the clinic will offer 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work' and 'cryotherapy'.

Meanwhile, the disclaimer on Pete's Facebook states: 'The information on this page is general information and should not be used to diagnose or treat a health problem or disease. 

'Do not use the information found on this page as a substitute for professional health care advice.

'Pete Evans does not make any representation or warranty (express or implied) as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set out on this page, and shall not have any liability for any misrepresentation (express or implied) contained in, or for any omissions from, the information on this page. 

'This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury whether based upon consumer law, negligence or any other cause of action.'

A similar message at the end of his podcast states: 'Nothing in this podcast should be used to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any medical condition. 

'Neither Pete Evans nor any sponsor endorse any views, opinions and conclusions expressed or shared in this podcast.'

Despite this, Evans has recently interviewed a string of conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccination activists, whom he offers uncritical and unwavering support.

In June, Evans was invited on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network.

The program faced criticism for choosing to interview Evans, thereby giving airtime to his dangerous anti-vaccination and coronavirus conspiracy theories.
