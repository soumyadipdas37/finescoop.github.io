Borussia Dortmund suffered their first defeat of the new Bundesliga season following a 2-0 defeat at Augsburg.

Felix Uduokhai and Daniel Caligiuri scored one goal each as the hosts went top of the Bundesliga table in a frustrating afternoon for the likes of Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland.

Dortmund were also left aggrieved when they were denied a second-half penalty for a foul on Giovanni Reyna, but Lucien Favre's men nonetheless dropped points for the first time this season after beating Borussia Moenchengladbach last weekend.

Fans were once again back in stadiums in Bavaria and were observing social distancing 

Tempers also flared during both halves between Erling Haaland and Augsburg's opponents

But having won the game for Dortmund there last season, Haaland could not score this time

Augsburg defended brilliantly and ensured Emre Can and his team-mates could not score

Frustration increased when they were denied a penalty for an alleged foul on Giovanni Reyna

But it was just not meant to be for Mats Hummels and co. as they dropped three points
