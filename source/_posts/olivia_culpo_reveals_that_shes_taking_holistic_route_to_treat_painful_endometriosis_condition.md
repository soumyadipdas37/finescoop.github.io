Olivia Culpo has revealed that she's taking a 'holistic' approach to deal with her endometriosis.

The 28-year-old beauty queen revealed last month on her Instagram Stories that she suffered from the typically painful disorder.

'It was something that I was nervous to share because I really didn't know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are,' Culpo told People in an article Wednesday.

'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods. They're not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility,' she added.

The Miss USA 2012 and Miss Universe 2012 winner was diagnosed last year with endometriosis, in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus.

Culpo noted the disorder can be 'very difficult' to diagnose.

'A lot of women may have painful periods, they may not be properly diagnosed. They may never be diagnosed. They may not be getting proper treatment, or surgery in some cases,' she said. 'And then, they're 50, 40 years old, and they had never been able to have children, and then you realize, 'Oh, maybe I had had endometriosis that I was never properly diagnosed.'' That's a common problem that I want to be able to use my platform to help'.

She advised women to get their egg count checked and to make sure that painful periods aren't affecting either their ovaries or eggs.

'Down the line, it's so heartbreaking when you think about someone who maybe could have taken action earlier, and now they can't have children. That to me just feels awful,' she said.

The Reprisal star revealed that she wasn't considering laparoscopic surgery to treat her endometriosis.

'I'm trying to do the holistic route as of now,' Culpo said.

She added: 'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we'll see. It's a journey. Every month is different because I try different things every month. But I'll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone's different.'

Culpo also shared that she's been 'loving' celery juice in the morning, enjoying home workouts and trying to carve out time for regular meditation.

She's been dating pro football player Christian McCaffrey, 24, for about a year.
