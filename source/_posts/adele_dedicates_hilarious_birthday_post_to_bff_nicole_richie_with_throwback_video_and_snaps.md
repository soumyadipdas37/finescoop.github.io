Adele treated fans to a rare glimpse at her close friendship with Nicole Richie on Saturday, when she dedicated a heartfelt belated birthday post to the star.

The British singer, 32, took to Instagram to profess how much she 'loves and admires' the daughter of Lionel Richie, while also sharing a hilarious clip and fun-filled snaps.

In the video in question, Nicole was seen crouching on a kitchen floor, as she waited for the star to walk in – and duly frightened her with a loud 'boo' once she did.



Adele was seen yelping in fear, before leaning down to hug Nicole on the floor amid laughter. As she walked away, the still shook up star muttered: 'For f**k's sake!' 

Also posting a selection of shots of herself with Nicole, whose 39th birthday fell on September 21, Adele wrote: 'Happy belated birthday to my daily dose of grace @nicolerichie I admire you and love you so much.

'You are the epitome of self preservation, self love and absolute savagery! You are so so cherished by so many angel girl! Keep making us laugh babes, we adore you to the moon and back ♥️.'

She rounded out her heartwarming post by adding the quote: 'I’m actually furious that now she knows that.'

Meanwhile, Adele and her rumoured love interest Skepta enjoyed a fun-filled night on the town, at a virtual reality centre in east London on Tuesday. 

Having returned to the capital from her £7.7m Beverly Hills home, the Hello songstress was said to be putting on such a raucous display with the Boy Better Know star, who turned 38 on Saturday, at the futuristic venue. 

The 'couple', who were joined by MC Jammer, were spotted at OTHERWORLD, an 'innovative social entertainment concept using unique, multi-sensory virtual reality technology', which is held in a converted railway arch in a backstreet in Haggerston. 

Insiders told MailOnline: 'We were asked to move from the lounge because a VIP was arriving. I couldn’t believe it when Adele just walked in with Skepta and Jammer...

'After doing the VR I saw her chatting to people and putting her boots back on. She seemed really down to earth. They were screaming and laughing when they were doing the VR together, I could hear her from the other end of the venue...

'It looked like they had a lot of fun together.'

The venue charges from £12 for a 40 minute session, up to £44 for an hour and 10 minute session per person, while drinks range from £2.00 for half a pint of Stiegl Radler to a bottle of champagne - the brand of which is unlisted - for £135.00. 

The Hello hitmaker and rapper were first linked to in October last year after it had emerged that Adele's marriage to Simon Konecki had broken down.

Rumours swirled in March that Skepta, real name Joseph Junior Adenuga, confirmed that things are now over between himself and Adele in a new track, Mic Check, from his album, Insomnia.

In the track, he rapped: 'Can you handle the fame? You know you’re f***ing with a star? When you’re f***ing with me, they talk about you in the Press.'

As well as being linked with Adele, Skepta has been reportedly dating supermodel Naomi Campbell, 49, for a few months up until April 2018.

Adele's arrival in London comes after a recent storm, when she was accused of cultural appropriation while marking Notting Hill Carnival last month.

After the row kicked off, supermodel Naomi and thousands of fans supported Adele when she being accused of cultural appropriation for donning a Jamaican flag bikini.

In a picture shared to her Instagram, Adele, posing in the garden of Beverly Hills home, wore her hair in Bantu knots leading some branding the move 'insensitive'.

While some claimed the singer was profiting off black culture by sporting the style, many others pointed out the star grew up in Tottenham, London and has been surrounded by black culture throughout her life.

Having moved on from the drama and returned from the states, Adele is clearly giving a nod to social distancing rules as the venue is cautious over restrictions.
