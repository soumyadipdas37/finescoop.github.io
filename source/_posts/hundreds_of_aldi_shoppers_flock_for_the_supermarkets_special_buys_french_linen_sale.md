Hundreds of shoppers flooded Aldi supermarkets in Melbourne for its special buys French linen sale. 

Large queues of bargain hunters were pictured outside several stores on Wednesday morning, despite COVID-19 restrictions.

Most customers were seen wearing face masks, but the crowds were pictured standing close together as they waited to get their hands on the luxury French flax linen sets for less than $100.

One woman said it did not seem like there was any system in place ensuring social distancing measures were maintained. 

Many onlookers were left shocked as the city still in Stage Four lockdown as the state's coronavirus cases remain high, with 42 new cases and eight deaths recorded on Wednesday.

Residents are still only allowed to leave their homes for work, exercise and shopping for food or other essential items.

Erica Cervini hit out at Aldi, saying it was 'extremely negligent' to allow this type of gathering to happen during lockdown. 

'A friend has sent me a pic of well over 100 in line outside an Aldi in north of Melbourne for special buys of French linen...This is extremely negligent of you to do this during lockdown/pandemic,' she wrote on Twitter. 

Another shopper said they drove to a store in north Melbourne hoping to grab some linen but drove home once they saw the massive lines. 

'I couldn't imagine how they'd let all those people in to bunch up together and gather around the linen shelf searching for sizes and colours,' she told the Leader.

'I just drove home again. I don't need linen that much.'  

Aldi Australia will bring back its luxurious French linen collection for a fraction of the price that's set to rival high-end brands costing hundreds of dollars (picture of the quilt cover set for $89.99 for queen size or $99.99 for king)

An Aldi spokesman said the company has implemented a series of social distancing measures across all stores, including 1.5 metre social distancing floor markers at checkouts to ensure staff and customer safety.

'Occasionally, heightened anticipation for a particular product has attracted more customers at once than usual, resulting in large lines. We need our customers to respect social distancing measures at all times, even when they are standing outside our stores.

'While the majority do follow the correct process, it is disappointing to see instances where social distancing measures are not adhered to.

'While our store teams do their best to enforce customer flows, such as limiting the number of shoppers in our stores, we also ask our customers to remember to keep at least 1.5 metres apart from each other at all times, both in and outside of our stores.

The French linen sheet sets, which includes flat sheet, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, will also return to shelves for an affordable price tag of $89.99 for a queen size or $99.99 for king

In addition to the collection, there's a $29.99 four-piece towel set, which includes two bath towels, hand towel and a face washer

'This measure is in place to ensure the utmost safety of our customers while they shop with us. We ask everyone to show cooperation, patience and understanding when shopping at ALDI.

The supermarket giant has come under fire previously for hosting its sales during the lockdown. 

In July shoppers desperate to get their hands on an Aldi special buy kids table formed huge lines outside one of the chain's supermarkets in Melbourne.

Images posted on social media showed a long line of people queuing for up to an hour before Aldi's doors even opened.

'The lines this morning were ridiculous but was worth the wait. Bought my little man the kids table and stool set and he loves it!' one mum wrote.

While the mother managed to quickly get into the store and purchase the $69.99 table, she admitted others were not adhering to social distancing rules.

A huge sale at Bonds at the same shopping centre also attracted crowds.

'You should have seen people going through the Bonds stuff, they were literally on top of each other. I didn't bother looking, coronavirus right there!' she wrote.

The woman was slammed for going out and standing in line during lockdown to get a non-essential item such as a table.

'I won't bother reading your comments. I'm just happy I got my hands on the table and chairs,' she replied. 

While other mothers shared their similar experiences, some were not impressed with how relaxed shoppers were.

'Yes, ridiculous lines for an area in stage 3 lockdown!' one woman wrote.

'That's a ridiculous line. No wonder why we are in this situation now,' another mother said.
