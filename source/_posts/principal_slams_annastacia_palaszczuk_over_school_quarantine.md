A school principal has slammed the Queensland government for asking her to treat her students worse than prisoners by forcing them into solitary confinement for two weeks.

Linda Evans, the head of Fairholme College in Toowoomba, said the demand to make 12-year-old borders quarantine when they return after school holidays interstate is inhumane.

'To place a child in a room on their own and bring meals to their doors constitutes solitary confinement. We don't treat our prisoners that way we won't treat our children that way,' she told Sunrise. 

Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan will today host a meeting with state education ministers on the issue. 

Australian Boarding Schools Association chief executive Richard Stokes wants the quarantine requirements to be scrapped. 

'They need to go home and see their parents but they can't even get a hug from mum,' he said.

'They will come back and live in an individual room and bathroom and be fed a meal in their room for two weeks.

'It is criminal to do that to an 11-year-old, or to a 17-year-old doing their first ATAR exam.'
