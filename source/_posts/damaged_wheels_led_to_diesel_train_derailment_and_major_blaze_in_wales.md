A diesel train that derailed in Wales and spilt 330,000 litres of fuel which sparked a major fire veered off the tracks after its wheels were damaged, investigators ruled. 

Ten of the train's wagons came off the tracks after faulty brakes damaged its wheels while it passed through Llangennech, near Llanelli, on August 26.  

Police officers evacuated 300 people from their homes and declared a major incident.

A diesel train that derailed in Wales and spilt 330,000 litres of fuel which sparked a major fire veered off the tracks after its wheels were damaged, investigators ruled 

Ten of the train's wagons came off the tracks after faulty brakes damaged its wheels while it passed through Llangennech, near Llanelli, on August 26 

Police officers evacuated 300 people from their homes and declared a major incident 

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said a preliminary examination found that all the train's wheels were 'probably rotating freely' when it left Robeston oil refinery in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, but 'at some point during the journey' the brakes on the third wagon became applied.

This created a flat spot on some of the wheels, leading to a section of track being distorted and the subsequent derailment of the third wagon, followed by another nine.

The locomotive and the first two wagons came to a stop about 180 metres away.

The driver 'looked back and saw that a fire had started in the wreckage', the RAIB said.

He uncoupled the locomotive from the first wagon and drove it around 400 metres away.

The driver was unhurt and reported the accident to a railway signaller.

The train was travelling at around 30mph when the incident happened.

The driver 'looked back and saw that a fire had started in the wreckage', the RAIB said 

Following the fire at 11.15pm on Wednesday, around 300 people within an 800-metre exclusion zone were asked to move as a major incident was declared

The driver was unhurt and reported the accident to a railway signaller. The train was travelling at around 30mph when the incident happened 

Around 300 people were taken to two evacuation centres overnight after the blaze

Ten wagons of the train, which were each carrying up to 100 tonnes of highly-flammable fuel, derailed in the accident 

Two members of the train's crew escaped unharmed following the blaze and will be interviewed by police

There were fears that diesel spillage into the nearby River Loughor could spell disaster for the local cockle fishery industry, with the Food Standards Agency advising the closure of shellfish beds in the area's estuary.

The RAIB said its investigation will consider why the brakes on the third wagon became applied, the maintenance history of the wagon, whether any other factors contributed to the derailment and how it led to the fuel spillage and fire.

The train, owned by DB Cargo UK, was travelling to a fuel distribution terminal in Theale, Berkshire.
