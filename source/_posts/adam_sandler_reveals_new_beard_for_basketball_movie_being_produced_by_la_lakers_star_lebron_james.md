Adam Sandler revealed Wednesday that his new beard was for a basketball movie being produced by LeBron James that he was currently filming in Philadelphia.  

The 54-year-old actor explained his beard while appearing remotely on the special Jimmy Kimmel Live Game Night episode before Game One of the NBA Finals between the LeBron-led Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat.

Jimmy, 52, quickly teased Adam about his thick beard.

'It's disgusting. I'm sorry. It's not a beard. It's a mask,' joked Adam.

Adam said that nobody liked his beard.

'Nobody likes it, at all. People on the street go, no! No, Adam. ''Doing it for a movie.'' They go, no!,' he told Jimmy.

Jimmy noticed basketball shoes in a case behind Adam and asked him about them.

Adam said he just got into a house in Philadelphia for a movie and coincidentally they were LeBron's shoes that the owner had signed by the star.

He then revealed that LeBron's production company was producing the film.

Adam said he plays an NBA scout in the upcoming movie who discovers a player in Spain and brings him to America.

'LeBron's company had it and they called me up and asked if I wanted to be a part of it,' Adam said.

Jimmy asked Adam if he meets with LeBron, 35, and if the Lakers star has an active role in producing the movie.

'You know, he's in the middle of a championship run right now. So we're going to get to sitting down and talking after that,' Adam said.

'But you know, it's a legit movie. It's a legit NBA movie because of LeBron, right,' he added.

Adam said that Toronto Raptors star Kyle Lowry, 34, was going to film with him.

The Lakers rolled past Miami 116-98 on Wednesday as LeBron had 25 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists in Game One of the best-of-seven NBA Finals.

'You can learn so much more from a win than you can in a loss,' LeBron said afterward. 'I can't wait for tomorrow for us to get back together and watch the film and see ways we can be better'.

Adam also was on the talk show to promote his upcoming new Netflix comedy horror movie Hubie Halloween that features former Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal, 48.

'Shaq gets the biggest laugh in the whole movie,' Adam shared.

The comedian said he daughters Sunny, 11, and Sadie, 14, also appear in the film and they had a 'great time' while he was nervous about their performing.

Adam said they had a socially distanced backyard screening with his daughters and all the children in attendance were dancing and jumping up and down as the credits rolled.

Hubie Halloween is scheduled to be released October 7 on Netflix.
