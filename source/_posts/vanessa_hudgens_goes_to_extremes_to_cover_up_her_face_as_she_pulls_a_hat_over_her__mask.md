Vanessa Hudgens slipped into a black sports bra and matching spandex shorts on Wednesday for a hike with pals around Los Angeles. 

As she worked up a sweat during her afternoon excursion, the 31-year-old actress showcased her taut midsection and sensational physique. 

Despite previously minimizing the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic in March, the raven-haired beauty diligently donned a CDC-recommended mask with a hat pulled over her eyes making it hard to see.

In addition to her red tie-dye facial covering, the former Disney star sported a canvas hat on top of her wavy tresses and a few gold bangles around her wrists. 

While she also displayed her envy-inducing abs, all eyes were on the High School Musical alum's pert derrière in her tiny bottoms. 

The beauty styled her sporty all-black ensemble with a pair of sneakers and mid-calf socks.

Her pals dressed in a similar fashion, as evidenced by the blonde next to her in a pair of black biker shorts and a white crop top.

She went viral this Monday after she put her knockout legs on display this Monday while dancing on TikTok with GG.

The women were recreating Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's choreography from the WAP music video and Vanessa was praised for her moves.

Vanessa, who starred in a televised production of Grease, expertly worked her way through the sultry dance routine in her backyard.

She also recently posed up a storm on her Instagram page in full leggy costume as Nicole Kidman's character Satine from Moulin Rouge.

The ensemble included a split scarlet gown and a pair of black opera gloves, plus a throwback chic hairdo redolent of the Belle Epoque.

She got together on her Instagram page with one Vince Rossi who was dressed up as Ewan McGregor's character Christian.

Vanessa fired up her Insta Stories to post footage of herself in her Satine costume mouthing along to the music from the film.

Her selection was the Elton John number, Your Song, which in Moulin Rouge was a duet between Ewan and Italian opera pop singer Alessandro Safina.

Moulin Rouge was helmed by Baz Luhrmann who is directing an upcoming biopic of Elvis Presley starring Vanessa's ex-boyfriend Austin Butler.

Vanessa was still with Austin when he landed the role and she gushed on Live With Kelly And Ryan last August that she was 'so excited that this is happening for him.'

Elvis' manager 'the Colonel' is played by Tom Hanks, who along with his wife Rita Wilson caught COVID-19 while in Australia for the shoot. They have both recovered.
