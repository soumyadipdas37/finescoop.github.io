She never puts a foot wrong with fashion. 

And Amanda Holden proved less is more as she headed to Heart Radio in London on Wednesday in a simple yet chic ensemble. 

The presenter, 49, was a vision of beauty in a classic jeans and nice top as she sashayed into the Global Radio studios.

Amanda draped her figure in a cream shell top that showcased her toned arms and complemented her tanned complexion. 

She teamed the garment with a pair of super skinny jeans that clung to her trim pins, whilst a pair of white stiletto heels boosted her frame. 

Injecting a touch of glamour, the mother-of-two accessorised with a Dior handbag and oversized sunglasses.

Amanda's outing comes after it was revealed she has ended up with a £6,000 luxury rabbit pen for her bunnies.  

The Britain's Got Talent host has made the most of her daughters old playhouse by transforming it into an incredible comfy home for her two rabbits Princess and Beatrice. 

Amanda is thought to have spent £6,000 to up-cycle the space for her beloved pets who can now enjoy their own porch and bunk beds, reports The Sun.

A source said: 'Amanda loves these rabbits, and they're treasured members of the family. It's only right they live like starlets.' 

And a representative for Amanda told MailOnline: 'The playhouse was purchased 6 years ago for Lexi and Hollie to play in, but they’ve outgrown it now.  

'Converting it into a home for the rabbits has cost just £200. Rather than dismantling it, Amanda has simply recycled it!'
