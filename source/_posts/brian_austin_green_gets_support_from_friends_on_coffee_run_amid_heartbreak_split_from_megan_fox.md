In an Instagram Live video last month, Green appeared somewhat upbeat about his marital woes. 

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he explained.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he said. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'   

Green continued: 'I’m on my path doing what I feel I need to do to be happy and it’s not for a lack of love for the kids or lack of being responsible, it’s really important to take care of yourself. t’s important for us as parents to take care of ourselves. I wish her all the best and I wish myself the best as well.'
