'I mean, I saw it. I continue to watch the whole series even after I'd been killed off in the lavatory,' he said, laughing.

'Because I just thought it's a fantastic television show, you know? I was very lucky to be part of it. I loved it; there were storylines [where] I wanted to know what was going to happen to these people! 

'I know that the finale satisfied a lot of people. It also disappointed a lot of people, and I'm afraid I am in the latter camp,' he said.

Charles also had kind words for the showrunners and writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, but he was disappointed by the finale, which concluded with a reserved scene of the surviving characters discussion who should lead Westeros.

'I think David and Dan raised the bar when it came to television screenplay writing,' he continued. 

'They are phenomenal. And for the whole thing to end up as a committee, I just thought, "Hmm, no." I would say I was somewhat underwhelmed by [the ending].' 

Time to eat! Later the pair were seen enjoying lunch together following a swim in the sea
