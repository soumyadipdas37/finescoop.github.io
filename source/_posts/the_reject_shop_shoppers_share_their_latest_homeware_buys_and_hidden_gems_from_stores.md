Shoppers have been showing off their incredible must-have buys from The Reject Shop after the budget retailed unveiled a stunning homewares range that rivals Kmart and Aldi. 

The discount chain experienced a huge increase in sales, driven by customers panic buying during the COVID-19 crisis - making it one of a few retailers to flourish during the pandemic.

And the retailer, which is best known for its very affordable everyday items, has continued to win over its shoppers by dropping hidden gems in its homeware aisles.

Thousands of customers are flocking to the one-stop-shop for all their modern home décor, storage solutions and on-trend furniture pieces.

Bathroom caddy: $20

Tall ceramic white vase: $12

Artificial plants: $5

Pantry labels: $4 

Metal floor lamp: $39 

Haven Metal Alarm Clock: $12

Basket with timber handles: $10

5-drawer cabinet: $15

Pot plant with saucer: $12

Among the deals are stylish vases, ranging between $9 and $12, that look considerably more expensive than its affordable price tags.

One mother explained how she strategically placed the vases on her kitchen bench to hide the power points on her wall.

'I needed something to hide it and make it look more appealing to the eye. So I used some cutting boards to hide the power points and some vases from to spruce it up,' she wrote on Instagram.

Thousands of Australians have been sharing pictures of their home transformations on Instagram after styling their space on a tight budget.

'Lord Mayor of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a house and filling it with things from The Reject Shop,' one shopper said. 

'The baskets with timber handles are my latest find! $10 each and they fit perfectly sideways in my pantry and perfectly longways in my laundry.'

Australians are turning to the retailer to get their budget items - including faux plants

Other shoppers revealed they were able to re-organise their entire pantry cupboards, using canisters and $4 food labels.

'Sorry Kmart but I much rather The Reject Shop pantry labels. Kmart labels only have half of the herbs and spices needed whereas The Reject Shop has dozen extras, plus they're easier to read on the larger jars,' one shopper said. 

One mother created the ultimate 'medicine cabinet' using three five-drawer cabinets she found from the store for just $15 each.

'I decided it was time to re-organise my medicine cupboard. While I already had this system in place it still requires some maintenance like all spaces you organise,' she said.

'I went through and grouped the categories back together, discarded any out of date items and made sure labels were still relevant for the categories.'

The new range comes just months after The Reject Shop released Tesco-branded grocery items in stores across Australia.

The retailer had signed a million-dollar deal with Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, to be able to sell its top items in its stores.

Sure to be a hit with British expats, Australians can now get Tesco Gold Instant Coffee 100g for $6, tinned vegetable soup, bottles of vinegar and packets of rice cakes for $2 and Tesco biscuits are range from $2 to $2.50.

The Reject Shop CEO Andre Reich said the supply deal meant huge savings were here to stay.

'We've teamed up with one of the biggest supermarkets in the world selling their best-selling lines. The higher the volume we buy, the cheaper it will be for customers,' he said.

Mr Reich told news.com.au: 'A lot of people are struggling to make ends meet, that's one thing COVID has taught us. We're all facing tough economic times. This is about giving Australians the best-quality products at the best price

As well as dry-store packaged food, Tesco will also supply The Reject Shop with a range of health and beauty products in coming months as well as other household items.

Although both parties admit the unusual deal may take some customers by surprise, Tesco Group Export Director Jack Brabin said it will be a major windfall for Australian consumers - along with the 1.2 million British expats living Down Under.

'We're delighted to be partnering with The Reject Shop to provide a range of fantastic Tesco products across grocery and baby care,' he said.

'As the UK's leading food retailer, we take enormous care to ensure our products are the best quality and offer great value. We look forward to sharing them with The Reject Shop's customers.'
