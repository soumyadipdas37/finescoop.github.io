Taiwan said today it has the 'right to self-defence and to counter-attack' after China flew nearly 40 warplanes over the Taiwan Strait in a show of force. 

The island's defence ministry said it was facing a 'high frequency of harassment and threat from the enemy's warships and aircraft' amid high tensions between Taipei and Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own renegade territory.  

China's People's Liberation Army flew 18 warplanes over the mid-line of the Strait on Friday, followed by another 19 on Saturday, while US envoy Keith Krach was visiting the island. 

Beijing also ramped up its rhetoric today by warning the US against helping Taiwan and saying that support for its independence was 'doomed to fail'.

Taiwan's air force scrambled their own jets and deployed an air defence missile system after the Chinese warplanes were spotted on Taiwan's side of the line.

The Chinese planes included four bombers as well as fighter jets from the country's Eastern Theatre Command.    

Taiwan's defence ministry said today it had 'clearly defined' procedures for the island's first response amid the 'high frequency of harassment and threats'. 

It said Taiwan had the right to 'self-defence and to counter attack' and that it followed the guideline of 'no escalation of conflict and no triggering incidents'.

Taiwan would not provoke but is also was 'not afraid of the enemy', it added. 

Beijing this month held rare large-scale drills near Taiwan, which Taipei called serious provocation but China said was necessary to protect its sovereignty.  

The island is a flashpoint with Washington, which promises military support to the elected government and has sent two envoys to Taipei in as many months. 

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin described the US envoys' visits as a 'political provocation' and threatened retaliation.

'China will take appropriate countermeasures, including targeting relevant individuals,' said Wang, without elaborating.

He warned that the US actions will 'further damage the cooperation' between the US and China.

Wang added that any support for Taiwan's independence is a 'dead end... doomed to fail'. 

Taiwan has been ruled separately from China since the end of a civil war in 1949, but Beijing considers the island part of its territory awaiting reunification. 

Beijing rejects any recognition of Taiwan and has mounted a decades-long policy of marginalising the democratic island. 

Washington's increased outreach is a catalogue of sore points with Beijing as the countries clash over issues including trade, security and the coronavirus pandemic.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of 'military blustering'. 

Keith Krach, the undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, wrapped up his trip at the weekend following a trip by US health chief Alex Azar in August. 

China sent numerous aircraft close to Taiwan during two days of drills from Friday, causing the island's air force to scramble, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior US official to Taipei.

WHY IS TENSION RISING NOW?

China claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed, a threat the island has lived with since 1949, when defeated Kuomintang, or Nationalist, forces fled there after their defeat by the Communists in the Chinese civil war.

China has been angered by stepped-up US support for Taiwan, including two visits in as many months by top officials, one in August by Health Secretary Alex Azar and the other last week by Keith Krach, the undersecretary for economic affairs.

In addition, the United States is planning major new arms sales to Taiwan. China views all these steps as effectively being US support for Taiwan independence, with the eventual establishment of a Republic of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and that the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan and has no right to.

China calls Taiwan its most important and sensitive issue in US ties. For China's ruling Communist Party, Taiwan is the last part of the nation still awaiting 'liberation' after the 1949 victory, adding an extra historical significance.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

Taiwan and China do not have an official dialogue mechanism, meaning that any accidental clash between their fighter jets, for example, could quickly spiral out of control.

Taiwan's air force now regularly scrambles to see off approaching Chinese aircraft.

A conflict over Taiwan may suck in the United States and its Asian allies, though it is an open question whether Washington would, or could, come to Taipei's aid.

China may quickly overwhelm Taiwan with missile and cyber attacks before the United States even has a chance to respond.

However, any war would be damaging for China too, in terms of its international reputation and economically, especially if it is subject to broad Western economic sanctions.

WHY IS TAIWAN STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT?

Not only is Taiwan in a key geographic location on the edge of the Pacific between the disputed South China Sea and Japan, but it is a tech powerhouse, home to the world's biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd .

The United States views China's tech firms as a security risk and has moved to cut off its access to advanced chips, including those from Taiwan.

HOW DO THE ARMED FORCES OF THE TWO SIDES COMPARE?

Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-armed, but is dwarfed by China's People's Liberation Army, which is adding stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and advanced missiles in the throes of an impressive modernisation programme.

Tsai has made upgrading Taiwan's military a priority, stressing 'asymmetric warfare', to make any attack as painful and as difficult for China as possible. This could include, for example, pinpoint strikes by long-range missiles on targets in China.

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A WAR BETWEEN TAIWAN AND CHINA?

While China could easily overwhelm Taiwan with missiles and air attacks, it has other options to bring the island to its knees, such as cyberattacks to take down basic infrastructure, or a naval blockade to force surrender.

Whatever happens, the reaction of the United States will be crucial.
