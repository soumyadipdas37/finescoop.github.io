ABC has made the surprising move of canceling hit new series Stumptown on Wednesday, just months after renewing the show for its second season.

The hit drama series starring Cobie Smulders set in Portland, Oregon was renewed by ABC in May, though Deadline reports that a 'timing issue' related to the delay in production lead to the show not being ready for the fall season, as ABC had planned.

Instead of just pushing the Season 2 premiere to midseason, ABC made the decision to not move forward with the season, though the show's producers are currently shopping it to other networks and streamers.

While the show is set in Portland, filming takes place in Los Angeles, and as of this week, there had still not been a firm production start date for the second season. 

The COVID-19 pandemic did have a 'significant impact' on the production delay, but it was also affected by the writing. 

The series went through a creative shift when showrunner Matt Olmstead left Stumptown to work on the new Law & Order: Special Victims Unit spin-off reuniting Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni.

Monica Owusu-Breen, who has worked on hit shows such as Alias, Lost and Fringe, was brought on to serve as co-showrunner, according to a report from The Hollywood Reporter in July. 

She will be working alongside series creator Jason Richman, and with this behind-the-scenes changes, the show wouldn't have been ready to film until April.

Since that is right at the end of the broadcast network's season, ABC opted to back away from the show, with the cast and crew notified this afternoon.

The show averaged 2.8 million viewers per episode during its 18-episode season, though its numbers improved significantly with delayed viewing while quickly developing a devoted fan base.

With extensive action set pieces and stunts, not to mention romance, it is said to be the type of project that would be impacted the most by filming restrictions in place due to COVID-19.

Stumptown joins other shows whose renewals were reversed due to COVID-19, including Netflix's The Society and I'm Not OK With This and TBS' I'm Sorry.
