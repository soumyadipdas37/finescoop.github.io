She was previously linked with Australian model James Abercrombie. 

But Mischa Barton had less familiar, but no less handsome company as she ventured out for a stroll in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 

The actress, 34, was arm in arm with actor Gian Marco Flamini during an appearance in the southern California city's Echo Park, more than a year after her stop-start relationship with Abercrombie came to an end.

Looking close, the pair removed their face masks - a mandatory requirement across  the state - and leaned in for a kiss as they walked through the central Los Angeles neighborhood. 

On another warm day Mischa looked relaxed in loose fitting black trousers and weathered Converse boots. 

Ensuring she stayed hydrated, the actress carried a large bottle of mineral water in one hand while draping the other across Flamini's back.

Mischa's former relationship with Abercrombie originally ended up in July 2019, shortly after fans noticed that the actress–turned–reality star had unfollowed the heir on social media.

At the time, a source to RadarOnline that 'James just turned out to not be the person she thought he was,' and that Mischa was 'taking some time to focus on herself right now.'

Another source to E! that Mischa 'broke up with him is to focus on her career.'

The on-off couple later sparked reconciliation rumours after they were pictured together in October. 

Mischa began dating James, a model from Melbourne, Australia, in spring 2017, shortly after the two met at a party in LA.

Their relationship followed a period of turmoil for the actress, who was hospitalized in January after a neighbor spotted her ranting over her backyard fence.

She later claimed that medical staff told her she had been given the date rape drug GHB.

Mischa also took a stand in March 2017, when she and her lawyer Lisa Bloom announced that an ex-boyfriend had filmed a revenge porn video and was attempting to shop the tape around to interested buyers.

She obtained a restraining order against the former beau in May of that year.

In an interview with the New York Times, Mischa credited Abercrombie with 'helping her through' the upheaval, adding, 'I think it drove us together.'
