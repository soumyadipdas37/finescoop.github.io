Australian workers have been forced to get the job done from home during the coronavirus pandemic - and our nation's porn stars are no different.

With no option to film in the United States under border closures and escort services and strip clubs largely on hiatus in many states, the adult industry has turned to streaming through platforms like Onlyfans and Pornhub.

Some adult entertainers are raking in 'five figures a month' through their subscription service and they say it's never been a better time for an Aussie in the industry.

It's been growing exponentially during COVID. It really peaked in late March when the nation went into lockdown. My subscriptions tripled,' Crissy Lee Bates (pictured) said

'Around the world Aussies are seen as hot, fun, playful, sexy, naughty and desirable, so being Australian is definitely an advantage,' popular OnlyFans performer Crissy Lee Bates told Daily Mail Australia.

But as international fans sign up from all over the world, domestically there has also been a major surge in traffic.

'I have noticed a big change. It's been growing exponentially during COVID. It really peaked in late March when the nation went into lockdown. My subscriptions tripled,' she said.

Content creators on OnlyFans charge subscribers a fee for personalised photos and videos.

But it's not just women raking in all the cash.

OhDavexx is one of Australia's most prominent male streamers. He says the key to success is knowing how to interact with your fans, so you can give them what they want.

'I do a lot of solo photos of videos but I've also teamed up with a number of porn stars and have made videos,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'You can make snippets of the video and sell the whole thing for whatever price you want to charge.

'The thing about Onlyfans is that it's all homemade and people love that, especially Aussie content. It's a growing market.'

While OhDavexx does not identify as gay or bisexual, he says the vast majority of his subscribers are men.

'Girls can make big money - I know girls who make 40 to 50 grand a month - it's a bit harder for guys and you have to rely on the gay clientele,' he said.

'I have a lot more male followers than female.'

One of Australia's biggest success stories on Onlyfans has been fitness model Jem Wolfie.

With 2.7 million followers on Instagram, her transition into explicit content has earned her over $2million since joining in August.

Another big winner is former V8 superstar Renee Gracie who walked away from her lucrative motor-racing career to become an online porn star.

She is now generating over $500,000 a month, through her legion of fans.

But Onlyfans is not the only streaming platform making adult content creators money.

Australia's hottest emerging porn star Charlotte Star, who was named Best Newcomer at the 2019 Australian Adult Industry Awards, said she focuses her attention on the website Modelhub, which operates through the world's largest porn site Pornhub.

'There are so many different streams of revenue other than Onlyfans,' Ms Star said.

'I use Pornhub because if you go on Pornhub you are going to get porn, if you go onto Onlyfans who know what you are getting.

The Australian star's most watched video on the site has over 2.6million views worldwide.

'I produce and direct all my own content. It's lucrative if you know what you're doing and if you know how to interact with your fans,' she said.

'Fans can order a custom video via email - saying could you wear this dress and say my name? Things like that - that is the best way to interact.

'I make five figures every month.'

But while it appears to be boom time for Australian adult stars, the race to produce explicit content is having is becoming more extreme.

'I was charging $20 per month and people were happy to pay for it. I would sell vids $25 each (before COVID),' Ms Bates said.

'But more people started doing it and then it peaked in March and it seemed like everyone was doing it, so there was so much price competition.

'People used to be happy for anything they got… but now some girls are charging $5 per month and putting full porn on there.

'It's like, if you're not getting extreme… You're not that interesting to some.'

The pressure to produce regular videos also has its drawbacks.

'Sometimes things get on top of me in my personal life,' Ms Bates said.

'I've got a farm with horses and just had a break up, so sometimes to try and keep a happy face and continuous content when you feel like s**t, that can be very demanding.'
