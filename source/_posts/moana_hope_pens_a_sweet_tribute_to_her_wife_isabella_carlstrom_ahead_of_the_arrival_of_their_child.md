Moana Hope is counting down the months until she and wife Isabella Carlstrom welcome their first child together.

And on Friday, the Ex-AFLW star penned a sweet tribute to her pregnant partner expressing her excitement at becoming a mother.

She shared a photo of herself and the model locking lips, as a colourful floral projection beamed on them, which was taken during their Japan holiday back in January.

'I can't wait to share motherhood!' Moana Hope penned a sweet tribute to her wife Isabella Carlstrom as they prepare for the arrival of their child. In the Instagram post shared on Friday, she wrote: 'Completely and utterly in love with you'

'Completely and utterly in love with you,' she wrote in the caption. 

'@isabellasofiacarlstrom I can’t wait to share motherhood with you,' she added along with the hashtags: '#mywife #ourlife #alwayssmiling.' 

Moana's heartfelt message to her wife comes after they marked their first wedding anniversary last month.

The former Survivor Australia star shared their wedding video to Instagram, and gushed over her pregnant wife in the caption. 

'Today last year I married my best friend, my soulmate and the mamma of our children to be,' Moana wrote.  

'I love that all we do is laugh, your smile makes my day light up. I wake happy knowing that I get to see and kiss your beautiful face. I'm completely in love with you. Thank you for always being you. Happy anniversary, my beautiful wife.' 

Forever: The couple married in Melbourne last August, 10 months after Isabella proposed

The video featured a compilation of home videos of the couple, including footage from their 2019 wedding.

The couple are set to welcome their first child together in November, and last month Isabella flaunted her burgeoning belly in a mirror selfie shared to Instagram.

In the photo, Isabella posed in her bedroom while cradling her bump and looking down at her belly.

'Twenty-three weeks today,' she captioned the snap.

In May, Isabella announced she was expecting a child with Moana.

'It's time to be mummas! We feel so incredibly grateful to be able to share this news. I am pregnant and Mo and I are expecting our little one in November,' she told her Instagram followers.

'It's been a beautiful journey and I can't believe we're finally at this point. It wouldn't have been possible without the amazing team at Monash IVF, so a huge thank you to them. I'm so excited to raise our child with you, beautiful.'
