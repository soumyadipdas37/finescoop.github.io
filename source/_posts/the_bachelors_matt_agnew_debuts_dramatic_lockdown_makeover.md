He left fans swooning on The Bachelor last year, but Matt Agnew has swapped his 'hot scientist' look for a more laid-back style in recent months.

Like many Melburnians living under stage-four lockdown, the 33-year-old astrophysicist has embraced a low-maintenance approach to grooming of late.

The reality star showcased his stubble and smile lines in a selfie shared to Instagram last week to raise awareness of mental health charity R U OK?

Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for not recognising Matt without his signature 'geeky' glasses, clean-cut look and sharp tuxedo.

The data scientist nonetheless looked handsome with five o'clock shadow and a grey beanie as he drew attention to a worthwhile cause. 

Matt's followers remarked on his changing appearance in the comments section of another recent Instagram photo.

'Gezzzz, you have changed. You don't look the same,' one wrote, while another added: 'You look different today.' 

However, those familiar with Matt's journey over the past few years will know that he has always preferred a more relaxed style.

He liked to keep things casual during his pre-Bachelor days as a university academic, with photos from that period showing him looking quite pedestrian compared to the Mills & Boon-esque leading man he was portrayed as on TV.

Matt chose 28-year-old chemical engineer Chelsie McLeod as his winner on The Bachelor last year, but their relationship didn't last.

The couple confirmed their split two months after the finale airdate, and Chelsie later hinted it wasn't her decision to end things.

One of Matt's contestants, Elly Miles, is the new Bachelorette. She is being joined on her journey by her sister, Becky.
