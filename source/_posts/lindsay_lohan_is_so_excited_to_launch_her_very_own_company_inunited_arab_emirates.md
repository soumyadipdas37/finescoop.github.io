Lindsay Lohan took to Instagram on Thursday to announce that she is launching her very own company.

'So excited to set up my own company in the UAE! My journey continues in this incredible country!' wrote the actress, 34, who has been living in the United Arab Emirates for the past six-years.

Though Lohan was excited to announce the venture, she did not disclose her company's name or any details pertaining to its purpose in her post.

The Parent Trap star went on to thank company setup specialists Virtuzone for making the 'setup process so smooth.' 

'If you are interested in setting up your own company here in the UAE, and looking to #BeYourOwnBoss then I recommend you get in touch with these guys,' concluded Lohan. 

Virtuzone, which was founded in 2009, states that their mission is to 'remove the complexities of company setup in the UAE so that our clients can focus 100% on running their businesses,' according to their official webpage.

Later, Lindsay directly thanked her consultant George for personally guiding her through the set-up process on her Instagram Story.

She included a heartwarming picture of herself posing in front of a #BeYourOwnBoss mural at Virtuzone's main office in Dubai.  

'Welcome to the Virtuzone family @lindsaylohan! We are excited to have you on board and look forward to being part of your entrepreneurial journey,' commented Virtuzone on Lindsay's post.

With a new business in the works, Lohan is clearly looking to secure her roots in Dubai, after having moved to the city in 2014.

Lindsay opened up about her life in Dubai during a remote appearance on Lights Out With David Spade in April.

'I'm in Dubai. I'm kind of in the Wall Street area of Dubai, it's like Downtown,' explained the Mean Girls actress.

'It's a city built on desert, I came here in 2008 when they had just finished building the Atlantis hotel, and there was none of this here. I've been living in the UAE for six years, but I go back to New York a lot.'

News of Lindsay's latest business venture comes after TMZ reported that she being sued by publishing company HarperCollins for failing to write a book despite being paid a handsome advance to do so.

HarperCollins claim that Lohan breached a contract that she signed with them in March 2014, with a promise to turn in the title - rumored to be a tell-all biography - by May 2015, which never materialized.

In legal documents filed by the publishing house, they claim Lohan was given a revised date of March 2017 to get it finished, and that they even paid her an advance of $365k against future royalties, TMZ reports.
