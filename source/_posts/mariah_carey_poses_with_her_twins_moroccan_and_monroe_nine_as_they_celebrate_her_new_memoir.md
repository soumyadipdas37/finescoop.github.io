Fans of the legendary singer have already been drawn to some of the books more salacious details, including a section on her brief affair with Derek Jeter.

According to the Always Be My Baby singer, she and the baseball legend shared 'a warm, slow, intoxicating kiss' on his roof, which later inspired her hit song The Roof, but they opted not to go further while she was still married to her first husband Tommy Mottola.

It wasn't until finalizing her divorce that she flew down to Tampa to be with Jeter, whom she claimed was only the second man she had slept with.

She described their night together as 'so sensual,' and wrote, 'Everything was so new and sweet, down to the smooth texture of his honey-dipped skin. It was how it was supposed to feel.'

Fling: The singer confirmed she and Jeter had a fling after her marriage to Tommy Mottola ended. She said he was only the second man she had slept with and called the experience 'so sensual'
