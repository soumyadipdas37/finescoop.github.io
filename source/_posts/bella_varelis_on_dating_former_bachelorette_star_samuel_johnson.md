Bella Varelis may have only just shot to fame in the last few months, but the influencer has been running in circles with reality stars long before The Bachelor.

In a new interview with Shameless, the 25-year-old opened up dating former Bachelorette star Samuel Johnson.

Sam memorably appeared on Georgia Love's season in 2016 and then went on to date Bachelor babe Noni Janur.

'We were actually together when [The Bachelorette] was on TV,' she revealed.

The brunette beauty briefly dated Sam in 2015, then got back with him once he'd filmed The Bachelorette.  

'We kind of rekindled after he finished filming, so when I was watching it back I was watching it back with his sister actually.'

Bella has been linked to many other stars from The Bachelor franchise, including some of Sam's own Bachelorette co-stars.

However, these connections appear to be more friendship-based than romantic. 

In 2018, Bella was spotted getting hands on with Cameron Cranley at a pool party.

The pair splashed around together in the water, and at one point Cameron wrapped his arms around the brunette beauty.

Bachelor In Paradise's Florence Alexandra was also at the party, further proving that Bella is well connected in the Bachelor social scene.

The Sydneysider also posed with Sam's former co-star Courtney Dober at her 25th birthday bash, and is close friends with Laura Byrne. 

Bella has even spent time with Dean Unglert, who is one of the biggest stars from the American Bachelor franchise. 

Since finding fame this year, Bella has been lucky enough to sign with an influencer agency.
