Families across Australia could be forced to forego their annual Christmas photos with Santa Claus due to the coronavirus pandemic.   

Mel Cross, a Brisbane-based Santa impersonator who has been working in the industry for almost three decades, said he is normally fully booked up for the holiday period by October.

'This is just crazy, I've never had a situation where I haven't had Santa bookings,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I have so many regulars that I've done over the last 20 years, councils and stuff like that. They normally book the same time each year.'

Mel Cross, a Brisbane-based Santa impersonator who has been working in the industry for almost three decades, said he is normally fully booked up for the holiday period by October - but is without appointments due to coronavirus

At this stage, it remains unclear as to whether shopping centres will be allowed to put on their annual photo shoot with Santa.

The health crisis has also put a dampener on end of year work parties, carols and Christmas Day celebrations with each state and territory enforcing their own coronavirus restrictions.

Most of Australia has controlled community transmission of the virus and Victoria - who battled a deadly second wave of infections - has seen daily new case numbers plummet in recent weeks.

Social distancing remains part of every day life, with Australians encouraged to keep a distance of 1.5 metres. 

'How do you social distance in Santa photos? Have four kids a metre a half away from each other?' Mr Cross asked. 

'In Queensland, I can't see see any reason why Santa can't be with the kids.

'We wear gloves, we wear a beard you can't breathe through.

'We can't wear a mask, we'd look silly.' 

Mr Cross said he normally does corporate work as Santa for the holiday period. 

He is seeking an answer as to whether his annual work will be allowed to go ahead in the coming months - but is unsure who to ask.

'Is Santa going to unemployed this year as well?' 

'Is Santa going to be different in every state and territory?' 

Mr Cross said it would be tough on children across the country if they can't get a hug with Santa Claus - and it would also impact their grandparents. 

'A lot of these kids take the photos to give to their grandparents,' he said. 

'It's a tradition to get Santa photos every year, it shows the kids growing every year, it's like a running scrapbook.'

Scentre Group, who own Westfield shopping centres across the country, were also unable to confirm if Santa photos would go ahead this year

A Queensland Health spokesperson told the ABC it was too early to tell what would happen with over the holiday period.   

'As always, our advice is dependent on the presence of COVID-19 in the community and the source of its transmission,' they said.

Scentre Group, who own Westfield shopping centres across the country, were also unable to confirm if Santa photos would go ahead.   

'We will continue to follow health and government advice across all Westfield Living Centres, as we have done throughout the pandemic,' Scentre Group said in a statement.

'We will deliver a COVID-safe, festive and enjoyable experience for our customers this Christmas.'
