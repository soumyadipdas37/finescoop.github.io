Manchester United are set to seal a £40million swoop for Ajax star Donny van der Beek this week.

The Old Trafford club, who return to pre-season this week, have identified the midfielder as a key signing and will look to wrap up the deal in the coming days.

Sportsmail understands talks between both clubs are underway with all parties growing increasingly hopeful that a move for the Holland international to join United can be completed. 

Manchester United will look to seal a £40million swoop for Ajax midfielder Donny van der Beek

United are willing to offer Van de Beek a five year contract worth a significant pay rise on his current £30,000-per-week wages.

Negotiations had accelerated on Sunday after United stepped up their interest and a deal is expected to be agreed in the next 24 hours. 

Van de Beek was training alone on Sunday as he waits for his future to be resolved. He was also absent from the squad for Ajax's friendly against Hertha Berlin.

Ajax coach Erik ten Haag confirmed: 'There are indeed developments that prevent him from being in the selection. We are looking at how that will end.' 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer now looks set to bring the highly-coveted Van de Beek to Old Trafford

Van de Beek scored ten goals in 37 appearances for Ajax last term. 

He will prove an exciting addition in midfield for United next season should the transfer be rubber-stamped as expected.

Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba formed a stellar partnership after the former's arrival from Sporting Lisbon in January, and Van de Beek would become another maestro to join the club's ranks.

The Mirror have also claimed that Van de Beek is expected to officially put pen to paper on a five-year contract 'in the coming days' despite a last-gasp hijack from Tottenham.

The report states that United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ultimately proved the decisive factor in the late transfer tussle after convincing Van de Beek to opt for his project and become the club's first big signing of the summer.

It is thought that United's chief negotiator, Matt Judge, hurriedly sealed the agreement with Van de Beek after discovering Tottenham made the audacious swoop this weekend.

It was claimed that United sealed the deal after being alerted to a late challenge from Spurs 

The player is even believed to have informed his friends in Amsterdam that the charm offensive from Solskjaer was an integral part behind his decision.

United recorded a third-place Premier League finish last season, and Van de Beek has also reportedly been swayed by the vision laid out for him by the club's ambitious manager.

The Holland international was a notable absentee from Ajax's friendly clash with Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, and it was soon confirmed he had not been selected due to ongoing discussions over his future.

Van de Beek appeared set to move to Madrid earlier this summer after the LaLiga club brokered an initial deal. Their interest was later scuppered, however, due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
