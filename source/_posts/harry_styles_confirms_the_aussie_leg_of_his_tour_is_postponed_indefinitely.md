UK superstar Harry Styles has cancelled the Australian leg of his Love on Tour, just days after fans were told it may go ahead.

Harry shared the sad news on Twitter on Tuesday, explaining that the Australian, New Zealand, Mexico and South America legs have been 'postponed indefinitely'. 

Harry wrote: 'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice.'

'I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021, but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months.  

'I can't wait to see you all on the road as soon as it's safe to do so,' he added.

The announcement comes three months after Harry postponed the North America leg of the tour.

'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice' Harry Tweeted overnight 

The Australian dates temporarily cancelled include shows in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Auckland and Melbourne - which is currently under stage four restrictions. 

Last week, fans blasted Ticketek for giving them false hope just days before the official announcement.

'The Harry Styles Australia & New Zealand tour is proceeding as planned and we are excited to welcome everyone to the events in November and December,' a representative for Ticketek wrote on Saturday. 

However, fans were quick to bite back on Twitter.

'Can't wait to go and watch a cardboard cutout of Harry on stage for 90 minutes,' one fan sarcastically wrote. 

'What world do y'all live in where there isn't a global pandemic and no international flights until at least 2021,' a second added.  

Harry was booked to play shows in Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth across November and December 

Meanwhile, a third chimed: 'As much as I want this to be true, I just don't see it happening and it breaks my heart.'

Others appeared to be angry that the ticket distributor suggested that there was a possibility the tour could be cancelled instead of rescheduled. 

'WTF 'cancellation' why not postpone? I can't go through the stress of getting tickets again,' one person wrote.
