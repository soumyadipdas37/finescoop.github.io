Jye Sebastian Webb-Italia, 18, and Jarod James Miller, 21, were arrested on Wednesday night and face the same charges.  

A 19-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man were also arrested and charged with with accessory after the fact to murder, Nine News reported. 

Detective Superintendent Brendan Smith said police will allege the group armed with Rambo knives 'hunted down' Mr Harris and his friends. 

The gang entered the Surfers Beer Garden where they also allegedly harassed the victim's friends.

'They've clearly gone into Cavill Ave to (allegedly) hunt down the victim and his friends and have a confrontation,' Detective Smith said, Gold Coast Bulletin reported. 

'It just shows their (alleged) mindset that they've just basically stabbed and killed someone in the street and they've kept on ... going into a licensed premises to attack other people.'

Detective Smith said there is CCTV of the lead up to the alleged murder, showing at least two members armed with knives.

Webb-Italia was represented by TWC Lawyer's Rodney Keyte in Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday morning. 

His face-tattooed friend Miller also appeared in court and made a Legal Aid application to get representation from a lawyer.   

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Keyte said his client Webb-Italia and his family were 'in a world of shock'. 

'He's obviously in shock as is his family. This is something, I'm instructed, that's never happened before.' he said. 

'Jye has obviously taken everything by shock. He's cut off from his family. It's hit him very hard.'  

Mr Keyte said the police allegations against Webb-Italia are 'very murky'.      

'What the police are alleging seems to be very murky,' he said. 

'They're going off CCTV footage and the action what they're describing is a slashing motion.' 

The lawyer confirmed a knife had been found near the scene but said there was no proof that it was the murder weapon.    

'A knife has been found within the vicinity of the deceased, it hasn't been confirmed that it was the murder weapon or even involved in the incident at all,' Mr Keyte said.

'I'm so thankful that Hannie has you in her life and I'll forever be grateful of the happiness you brung to our daughter and that you loved her endlessly. 

'Rest In Peace Raymond, you'll be missed.'

Another bystander came across the scene after finishing work.

'When I walked over at the end of my shift he was lying on the floor bleeding out, blood everywhere - the poor guy looked lifeless,' they wrote.
