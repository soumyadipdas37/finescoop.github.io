Retired MLS midfielder Kyle Martino has 'never been happier' since ending his eight-year marriage to Eva Amurri in February and quitting his seven-year career as an NBC Premier League analyst last month.

'There is no "right way." Life, love, family, and career take many forms,' the Georgia-born 39-year-old explained on Friday.

'I know the decision Eva and I made to be a "different" type of family, and me once again stepping away from a "dream job" to pursue other passions, evokes confusion or even criticism.

'The truth is we've never been happier because we've found "our way." Our kids now see a genuine version of parents who love them, love each other, and most importantly love themselves. So in these challenging times I only offer this simple suggestion: Find you, and be it.'

Many are still scratching their heads over Kyle and the 35-year-old daughter of Oscar winner Susan Sarandon's decision to divorce a month before welcoming their third child, son Mateo Antoni, in March.

Martino has kept busy renovating his new apartment in Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood where he let six-year-old daughter Marlowe Mae and three-year-old son Major James decorate their rooms.
