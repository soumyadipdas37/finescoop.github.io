The incident was caused by a tidal bore, a rare natural phenomenon that occurs when the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave of water that pushes into a narrow waterway

The incident was caused by a tidal bore, a rare natural phenomenon that occurs when the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave of water that pushes into a narrow waterway.

The tidal bores occurring in Hangzhou’s Qiantang River is said to be the largest of their kind in the world, with tides reaching up to 30 feet and going as fast as 40 km/h (about 25 mph), according to reports.

The roar of the tidal wave can be heard for hours before it bores up the river, and the river's water stays risen for several hours after the bore passes.

Tidal bores can be seen in several locations around the world, including the Britain's longest river, the Severn, but the Qiantang bore is the largest.

The river has attracted hundreds of thousands of tide-watchers every autumn, hoping to get a glimpse of the dramatic scene.

A powerful tidal bore was caught on camera over the weekend after it hit a road along the riverbank and swept away a dozen cars.

The gushing river water quickly swallowed the busy street, causing huge splashes.

In August 2013, the tidal bore turned out stronger than expected due to Typhoon Trami, reaching more than twice its usual height as it broke on the flood barrier, sweeping it and injuring numerous spectators.
