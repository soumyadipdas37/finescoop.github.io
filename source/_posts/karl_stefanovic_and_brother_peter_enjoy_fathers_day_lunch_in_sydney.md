He may be a popular breakfast television presenter, but fatherhood certainly looks like the perfect role for the Today show's Karl Stefanovic.

The 46-year-old was every inch the doting dad at a Father's Day lunch in Sydney on Sunday, with wife Jasmine Yarbrough and their four-month-old daughter Harper. 

Karl could not wipe the smile off his face, as he was joined by daughter Ava, 15, brother Peter Stefanovic, sister-in-law Sylvia Jeffreys and the couple's son Oscar.

Karl cut a cool and casual figure in a black T-shirt, skinny-leg jeans and sneakers. 

He added a black shearling jacket to the look, and concealed his gaze behind trendy tortoiseshell sunglasses and a black cap. 

The Channel Nine star was all smiles as he pushed his daughter's stroller, with Harper looking cute as a button in a white onesie.
