On Tuesday morning, Lacey Turner was spotted for the first time since announcing her pregnancy last week. 

After the EastEnders actress, 32, delightedly revealed the happy news last week, she was seen out in Wenzel's Bakery in Watford grabbing some treats. 

Going for pure comfort, Lacey wore an oversized tracksuit with sunglasses and was sure to exercise caution by wearing a mask in the bakery.

Lacey was keeping things casual as she proved to be taking to pregnancy swimmingly in her loose-fitting and comfy two-piece.  

The star and her husband Matt Kay, welcomed their daughter Dusty in July 2019 after suffering two miscarriages, and admitted that they 'feel so lucky' to have conceived. 

Lacey gushed that their happy news was a 'miracle', a day after it was reported she would be taking another extended break from BBC soap EastEnders.

Speaking to OK!, Lacey said: 'We feel so lucky to be expecting our second baby, as it took so long to get Dusty.'  The star, who is 16 weeks pregnant, had two miscarriages before conceiving her daughter, 14 months.

'It took so long with Dusty,' explained Lacey. 'But now they're coming along like buses! After the heartbreak we went through, it's a miracle to fall pregnant so quickly.'

Both of Lacey's miscarriages happened at seven weeks and she admits it is a 'huge relief' to be further along the pregnancy and past the heartbreaking milestone.

She admitted: 'I still feel nervous but I think I always will. I got past seven weeks, then nine weeks, and so on. They're all milestones...

'The 20-week mark is the point I feel like I can breathe a bit easier, as it's the halfway point. Although I went straight onto progesterone as I think that helped last time.'

She added that she has been 'reassured' by having private scans every two weeks due to her previous losses. 

On Sunday it was reported that Lacey is set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square.

The TV star will be back on screens this week after she went on maternity leave for a year with her daughter Dusty, fourteen months. 

According to the Daily Star, Lacey's return will be a brief one as she will be off the soap again by the end of the year, with bosses currently plotting her temporary departure.

There will be plenty of time for fireworks during Lacey's brief return though as Stacey will discover her estranged husband Martin Fowler [James Bye] is in a relationship with her best friend Ruby Allen [Louisa Lytton].

An insider said: 'Lacey will be taking a break. The top bosses agreed to give her some time off from the show.

'This is a great opportunity for the writers to come up with something big for Lacey to get her teeth into.'

The source added that Lacey will return to the soap within the year and there are no plans for her to permanently leave EastEnders.
