Jadon Sancho 'will fit in like a duck to water' alongside the likes of Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes, his former youth coach believes.

Louis Lancaster oversaw the England international's development while at Watford, before seeing him move on to Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund.

Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy is close to completing his move to Chelsea, according to Sky Sports.

A £22m deal has been agreed between the clubs and an announcement is expected in the next 24 hours.

Derby County are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Fiorentina for former Liverpool youngster Bobby Duncan.

The 19-year-old, who is the cousin of Reds legend Steven Gerrard, left Anfield in acrimonious circumstances last summer.

Burnley are very interested in signing Brighton midfielder Dale Stephens, according to Sky Sports.

The Clarets have shown interest in Stephens in the past, after they had six bids rejected for him four seasons ago.

Huddersfield have agreed a fee with Benfica for former Arsenal youngster Chris Willock.

Winger Willock, 22, spent the second half of last season on loan at Huddersfield who now want to make the move permanent.

Luis Suarez has finally sealed his acrimonious exit from Barcelona after reportedly agreeing a termination of his contract.

Despite long-term interest from Juventus it appears that Atletico Madrid is the next destination for the Uruguayan striker, according to Spanish outlet RAC.

Crystal Palace have launched a £25 million bid for Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster as a host of Premier League clubs battle it out for his signature.

Palace's bid is comprised of £19m plus £6m in add ons, while there is also a £37m buy-back clause as part of the deal.

Diego Simeone has reportedly made contact with Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira, with Atletico Madrid interested in bringing the 24-year-old to the club on a loan deal.

Torreira's future at the Emirates Stadium is uncertain, with new boss Mikel Arteta looking to strengthen his midfield before the transfer window closes. Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar have been heavily linked with a move.

Manchester City are continuing to scout the depths of Spain in their search for a new centre-back. Sevilla's Jules Kounde has become the club's latest target.

Recent reports in France, according to Sky Sports, have suggested that City have agreed personal terms with Kounde despite not meeting his £64m valuation.

Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has urged the club to make signings or risk falling behind their Premier League rivals.

The club have made just one signing in the close season with Donny van de Beek arriving from Ajax, while a move for Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho has stalled.

Norway international Odegaard spent last season on loan at Sociedad but lined up against his former team-mates in midfield to make only his third appearance for Real.

Ibe was released by Bournemouth at the end of last season after a difficult four seasons on and off the pitch in which he scored just three Premier League goals.

In his final campaign at the Vitality Stadium, he played just four matches in all competitions and failed to score a single goal.

Their first-choice central defensive pairing of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof looked vulnerable to Palace's pace during Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford.

With other options in that department including Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Axel Tuanzebe and Teden Mengi, United did not feel it necessary to prioritise another centre-back this summer.

Nuno Espirito Santo has been searching for a replacement for Matt Doherty following his departure to Tottenham and sees Semedo as the ideal candidate, according to Fabrizio Romano for the Guardian.

Brewster has been a permanent transfer target for Palace and Sheffield United this summer, while West Brom have also been keen to sign 20-year-old the on loan.

It is understood Liverpool are willing to strike a deal with Palace, but are demanding a buy-back option and sell-on clause for £20m-rated Brewster.
