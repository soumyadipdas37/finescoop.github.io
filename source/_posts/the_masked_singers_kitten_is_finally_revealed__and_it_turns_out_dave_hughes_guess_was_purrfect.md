On Tuesday's episode of The Masked Singer, the celebrity inside the Kitten costume was revealed. 

The star inside the furry pink ensemble was none other than comedian and TV host Julia Morris, 52. 

Judge Dave Hughes was delighted with the unveiling as it was the first time he managed to guess a reveal right in two seasons of the show.

There were doubts from the judges that the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! host was the Kitten as she had recently revealed she had injured her back. 

However, Julia, who had sung the Lesley Gore song You Don't Own Me that evening, said she indeed was wearing a brace and had to solider on through the show. 

'I have got my back brace on. I have seen the physio every second day since the show started. I am a proper mess!' she told host Osher Gunsberg.  

Off with her head! The judges made their guesses before the singer's mask was removed 

It's her! The star inside the furry pink mask was none other than comedian and TV host Julia Morris (pictured) 

Good guess! Judge Dave Hughes (pictured) was delighted as he had guessed right for the very first time in the two seasons of the show so far

The comedian said that she managed to hide that she was on the show from her children.   

She joked: 'Apparently I'm a great liar. The girls don't know. So nobody knows. Ladies, Mummy's been out! 

'In the first episode that they saw, they're like, "Oh, God, Mum, that cat's singing that song that you won't stop singing."' 

Didn't squeal: The comedian said that she managed to hide that she was on the show from her children. She joked: 'Apparently I'm a great liar. The girls don't know. So nobody knows'

Julia said she loved singing and performing on stage again: 'It's been so exciting. Being behind the mask, I was allowed to have my turn at being a singer, and that was so thrilling. I've had such a wonderful experience,' she said

In fact, the kids were not fans of the Kitten, Julia admitted:  'My younger one thought it looked really creepy. So I gave her a smack and, um... No, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't. That's a joke.'

Julia said she loved singing and performing on stage again after so much television work.   

'It's been so exciting. As a comedian, you don't want anyone to think you're taking yourself too seriously. 

Ouch: There were doubts from the judges that the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! host was the Kitten as she had recently revealed she had injured her back

It's true! However, Julia said she indeed was wearing a brace and had to solider on through the show. 'I have got my back brace on. I have seen the physio every second day since the show started. I am a proper mess!' she said 

'Being behind the mask, I was allowed to have my turn at being a singer, and that was so thrilling and it just filled me up in a great way. I've had such a wonderful experience,' she said. 

Julia's appearance on the show was the subject of a spoiler earlier in the week.   

Costume designer Tim Chappel accidentally revealed who is behind the Kitten costume on Monday. 

Chappel made the blunder when asked if he was told who he was designing the elaborate costumes for by Deborah Knight on Channel Nine's radio show 2GB 873.

Oh dear! 'Ah, yeah, yeah it was Julia Morris. And didn't she make the most amazing pink kitten? She was just so fabulous in that costume,' Chappel said on the show

'Ah, yeah, yeah it was Julia Morris. And didn't she make the most amazing pink kitten? She was just so fabulous in that costume,' Chappel said on the show.

'But to answer your question, no, we design all the costumes first and then we get the cast and then we shoehorn the cast into the costumes.'

Listeners on the radio show were quick to note Tim's slip of the tongue, with one tweeting: 'Just had costume designer Tim Chappel confirm the identity of kitten on @2GB873 10 wont be happy.' 

While the radio clip has now been removed, Tim's answer confirms the guesses of avid viewers, who have made the star's name trend on Twitter.
