Damian Lewis was seen enjoying a stroll with his daughter Manon, 13, and son Gulliver, 12, on Tuesday.

The actor, 49, appeared to be in good spirits as he and his children, who he shares with wife Helen McCrory, headed out on a shopping trip in Oxford Street, London.

Putting on a casually chic display, Damian shrugged on a black jacket over a dark blue shirt that he teamed with grey chinos.

Damian completed his look by stepping out in a pair of black-and-white Adidas trainers, while he carried his phone on hand during the stroll.

The Homeland star slicked back his fiery locks behind his ears and he wore a close-cropped beard for a ruggedly handsome look.

Mason looked stylish as she paired a blue cardigan with a matching top and denim shorts, and she colour-coordinated the look with a pair of blue trainers. 

Gulliver, meanwhile, opted for a more relaxed look as he wore an oversized shirt with loose-fitting trousers, and he was seen carrying a skateboard on the outing.

In March, Damian joked that he finally knows what his wife Helen McCrory looked like as they self-isolated together in their Suffolk home amid the coronavirus pandemic.

His words came as the couple made a rare joint TV appearance on Friday's Good Morning Britain to promote their new initiative with food chain Leon to help feed the NHS.

The couple appeared via video link where they joined hosts Kate Garraway and Ben Shephard to discuss their fundraiser, in which they hoped to raise £1 million to give hot meals to busy NHS staff who are working tirelessly during the coronavirus crisis.

And amid the chat, Helen and Damian, who married in 2007, were asked how they were coping with the self-isolation, after having had busy acting schedules previously.

Homeland actor Damian, 49, joked that if one 'liked' their family then isolation is 'fantastic'.

Ben then asked the star: 'Have you been able to introduce yourself to your wife because I think it’s been a while that you’ve not only been in the same country, but certainly in the same building!'

To which Damian added 'I know, it’s amazing! I had no idea she looked like that!' as he spends quality time with his Peaky Blinders star wife, 51. 

The star added that it was great to be in lockdown with his family, stating that 'we're really enjoying' spending this priceless time together. 

Damian also told that he's enjoying having the time to do 'all the things I should have done in my life.'
