A woman has been charged with murdering her six-year-old son after she was found swimming naked in a Florida lake and repeatedly saying, 'God forgive me.' 

Labreaunne Wilson, 26, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon for the death of her son, Avion Borner, who was found unresponsive by his maternal grandmother in a bathtub at an extended-stay hotel in Orlando. 

According to an arrest affidavit, at around 2.25pm, Wilson was seen on video dragging her son from Key Suites on Orange Blossom Trail across the street to Lake Tyler.

Labreaunne Wilson, 26 (left), has been charged with first-degree murder in death of her six-year-old son, Avion Borner (right) 

Wilson was found swimming naked in Lake Tyler in Orlando, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon and repeatedly saying, 'God forgive me' 

After a few minutes, Wilson returned alone to the hotel, reported Orlando Sentinel. Some 30 minutes later, she headed back to the lake and returned carrying her limp and wet son across her shoulder. 

At around 4.30pm, Wilson went back to the lake for a third time, stripped off her clothes and went into the water. People who saw the woman swimming in the nude tried to convince her to get out, but she kept saying, 'God forgive me.' 

Rescue crews responded to the scene at around 4.45pm and pulled Wilson to safety. She was then transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where she reportedly told sheriff's deputies, 'I think I killed my child.' 

Avion's limp and wet body was found in a bathtub at the Key Suites extended-stay hotel on Orange Blossom Trail

Avion's maternal grandmother was the one who found him in the tub and called for help

The child was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. Two hours earlier, he was seen on video being dragged by his mother toward the lake across the street from the hotel 

She was said to have made similar statements, unprompted, to bystanders watching the water rescue and to a paramedic en route to the hospital. 

Meanwhile, investigators learned that Wilson's six-year-old was found unresponsive in the hotel room tub by his grandmother and taken to Arnold Palmer Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 

Wilson was discharged from the hospital after she was found to be uninjured and booked into the county jail on a charge of first-degree murder.  

A witness told investigators that she had spoken to Wilson in the courtyard of the hotel complex just before the incident and said she seemed fine until about 2.30pm, when the woman suddenly grabbed Avion by the arm and said they had to leave.
