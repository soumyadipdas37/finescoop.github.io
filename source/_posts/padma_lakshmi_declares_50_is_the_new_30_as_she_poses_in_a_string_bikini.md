Padma Lakshmi thinks '50 is the new 30' and she is 'just getting started.'

The Top Chef star made the comment on Instagram on Wednesday the day after she celebrated her milestone birthday with her 10-year-old daughter Krishna and partner Adam Dell.

Along with the caption was a head-to-toe image of the Indian-born former Vogue model in a purple string bikini that revealed her flat tummy and very toned body.

She could be right: Padma Lakshmi thinks '50 is the new 30.' The Top Chef star made the comment on Instagram on Wednesday the day after she celebrated her milestone birthday

The star from Chennai, India appeared to be very toned as she flashed her sculpted arms, slender legs and small waistline.

The beauty had her raven hair put up in a messy bun as she modeled aviator sunglasses 

Lakshmi had on no jewelry, just a hair tie around her wrist. 

There were several other photos added where she was splashing around on the shore smiling all the time.

There is more to come from her: The cookbook author also noted that she felt like she was just getting started

On Monday she turned 50 and posted two other bikini snaps with a powerful message reflecting on the events of this past year.

The first photo Padma shared was one of herself holding a starfish as she stood on the beach wearing a colorful two-piece.

The Hulu star looked absolutely amazing as she stood at the waters edge with her line of vision towards the ocean animal.

In the second snap, Padma played around in the pool with her partner Dell and their daughter Krishna.

Padma raised her arm high up into the air as she gazed towards her daughter, who stood upon her father.

Her lengthy caption detailed the mixed emotions she had been grappling with this past year amid the pandemic.

From the highs to the lows, Padma candidly described them all.

While admitting just how fortunate she has been, she acknowledged 2020 has been a painful year for so many.   

'Birthday thoughts,' she began with a cloudy sun emoji. 'This year has been a mix of misery and elation.

'The whole world was swallowed up by the plague In March. We were lucky but so many weren’t and I felt an impending doom, a creeping anxiety I could not shake.

'Then another Black life was taken and it was good that we all rose up- but so painful too. So painful that some of our fellow Americans could not even bring themselves to say that Black lives matter, some who hold our highest offices.

'But personally, at home things were peaceful. We made a cocoon for our family. We lived for the first time-all under one roof. We became closer.

'And professionally, I finally got to show the world what I would do if I got to build a show from scratch. "Taste the Nation" was well received beyond my wildest dreams, 100% even on rotten tomatoes!

'I am truly blessed': Lakshmi was grateful to have the support of her partner Adam Dell (pictured 2017)

That's her girl: Lakshmi said her daughter 'continues to be a miracle every day'

'But the best of all was hearing how all of you felt when you watched it, reading how families watched together.

'The episode with my mother and littlehands felt like a tribute to all my mother and millions of other immigrant parents had sacrificed.

'I cannot ask for anything more. I am truly blessed: a loving and attentive partner, a child that continues to be a miracle every day and work that I am proud of and fully engaged by with people I love.

'I am today very lucky. But I am also a product of the toil and troubles my younger self endured. And I thank that version of me.

Melting pot: 'The show was really just an extension of my advocacy work,' Padma previously told Us Weekly of the show

'Thank you all so much for joining me on this trip. I have loved sharing it with all of you everyday (even the Trump supporters) #thisis50 #virgoseason.'

Padma rose to stardom as the host of the hit Bravo competition show, Top Chef, for which she was nominated for an Emmy. 

Nowadays she is on Hulu as the host of yet another food-oriented show, Taste The Nation.

'The show was really just an extension of my advocacy work and I hope it’s a way to advocate for these communities, while being informative and teaching people something, but also just being entertaining,' she previously told Us Weekly.
