She enjoyed a relaxing spa break with her mother Joanne at the weekend.

But Dani Dyer flew solo as she headed food shopping in Essex later on Sunday.

Last month the reality star announced she was expecting her first child with boyfriend Sammy - just three months after they rekindled their relationship. 

'Little bubba can't believe you are going to be ours,' she wrote, 'Me and Sammy are so excited to start this next chapter in our lives, feel so lucky and grateful...2021.' 

Dani recently said that she has started to 'embrace' the changes in her body.

She wrote: 'I've really started noticing the changes in my body and I'm definitely embracing it.  

'Apparently at this stage I'm supposed to feel 'on top of the world' which I really hope for as the first few months have been really hard.'

But Dani revealed it was a struggle to find suitable maternity clothes and said she only had a handful of outfits to choose from.   

She said: 'I'm so in denial that I don't fit into any of my clothes anymore. I can't find any nice maternity clothes, all very granny for me.

'I'm literally living in six outfits, I've got two pairs of jeans that I bought from Zara that are like a paper bag and four tight dresses, the ones that are really stretchy.

'And I'm sitting here like, what am I going to wear today? I have to alternate my outfits cos I've literally got six that fit me.'

Dani also gave an update on the severe migraines she had been experiencing during her pregnancy, saying acupuncture had provided her with relief. 

 She said: 'I asked my midwife and it's completely safe, so far so good. I have another one next week. Spent less time on my phone/television (like the doctor said haha). 

'Drinking a lot more water and noticed a difference.' 

Hey little baby! Dani shared a picture of her most recent scan and admitted it 'made their day' seeing their unborn baby during the ultrasound
