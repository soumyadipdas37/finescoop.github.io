Zoe, 42, was dressed in a long-sleeve black top and pale green trousers rolled up to just below her knees.

She wore her hair styled in a bun and took photos and videos of her family as they frolicked in the surf. 

Marco, 41, had on a full body wet suit and was clearly at home riding the waves.

Zoe and her husband, who each took each other's last names upon marriage, have a very progressive approach when it comes to raising their three children.  

In an April 2019 interview with US Weekly, the Avatar actress revealed that she and Marco raise their sons in a gender-neutral household.

Part of the way they structure their lives is by making sure the children have both male and female toys, while ensuring that she Marco do not perform traditional gender roles at home. 

First speaking out on the subject in 2018, Zoe said 'I get to do a lot of male things, which is, I don’t know, put the TV together, fix things that break' adding 'I think it’s important to raise boys in that environment, and girls as well.'
