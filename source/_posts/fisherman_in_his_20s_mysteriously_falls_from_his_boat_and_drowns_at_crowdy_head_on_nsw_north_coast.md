A young man has died after falling out of his boat at a popular fishing spot on the New South Wales mid-north coast.

The fisherman, believed to be in his 20s, was discovered about four nautical miles off Diamond Head, south of Port Macquarie, on Wednesday afternoon.

His body was found by strangers on a nearby boat who hauled him out of the water and attempted to revive him.
