Joaquin Phoenix has reportedly welcomed his first child with fiancée Rooney Mara, a baby boy named after his late brother River Phoenix.  

Director Victor Kossakovsky spilled the beans at the 2020 Zurich Film Festival after a screening of the film Gunda, on which Joaquin served as executive producer.  

He slipped in the news during a Q&A over the weekend, after he was asked how he got the new dad involved in the film: 'He just got baby by the way... A beautiful son called River.' 

 

Joaquin, 45, and Rooney, 35, have not officially announced the birth of their firstborn, but they never confirmed their pregnancy in the first place.

A source told Page Six in May that the couple was approximately six months along, soon before she began to show off her baby bump during outings.  

Rooney began dating her Her (2013) costar in late 2016, and they later starred together in Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot and Mary Magdalene, both of which premiered in 2018.

The animal rights advocates live in the Hollywood Hills with their two dogs Soda and Oskar, and their engagement was confirmed last July.
