The TV executive and presenter was chairman of the scandal-hit charity as it headed for financial meltdown despite receiving almost &pound;50 million of taxpayers&rsquo; cash
The BBC&rsquo;s Alan Yentob could be barred from screens this autumn due to a legal wrangle over the controversial Kids Company charity.
The TV executive and presenter was chairman of the scandal-hit charity as it headed for financial meltdown despite receiving almost &pound;50 million of taxpayers&rsquo; cash.
Now, five years after The Mail on Sunday made a string of revelations including how Kids Company spent tens of thousands of pounds of public money helping migrants to remain in the country and claim benefits, Mr Yentob faces a court case brought by the Insolvency Service from October 12.
The 73-year-old, who is thought to earn more than &pound;200,000 a year for his work on the BBC&rsquo;s arts programme Imagine, is among seven charity managers who could face three-year bans from being company directors.
Corporation insiders argue his involvement in the high-profile legal action means that he should not appear on screen during the ten-week hearing.
Others due to give evidence are Kids Company&rsquo;s chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh.&nbsp;
The organisation, which helped troubled children in South London, was given huge subsidies over almost 20 years &ndash; including &pound;7.3 million in the five months before it folded in 2015.
Among the revelations, the charity arranged for one of its clients to have private sex-change surgery.
It emerged that Ms Batmanghelidjh had a &lsquo;personal private swimming pool&rsquo; in a &pound;5,000-a-month mansion paid for from charity funds.&nbsp;

It was also alleged that thousands went on the boarding school costs of a chauffeur&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
And we also showed how Mr Yentob, who reportedly has a &pound;6.3 million BBC pension, secretly lobbied the Labour government over an unpaid &pound;700,000 tax bill which was later waived at public expense.
A Charity Commission report into Kids Company cannot be published until the court case is over.&nbsp;
The Insolvency Service is pushing for a six-year ban on Ms Batmanghelidjh from being a company director.
In 2018, one former director, Sunetra Atkinson &ndash; the ex-wife of actor Rowan Atkinson &ndash; was banned for more than two years because of her role in the scandal.
Last night, a former Kids Company employee said &lsquo;Many ex-Kids Company staff still haven&rsquo;t been paid wages they are owed, while Alan Yentob and the others have carried on with their lives quite happily.
&#039;Now they&rsquo;re spending even more public money fighting this case. It&rsquo;s disgraceful.&rsquo;
Last night, both Mr Yentob and the BBC declined to comment.
