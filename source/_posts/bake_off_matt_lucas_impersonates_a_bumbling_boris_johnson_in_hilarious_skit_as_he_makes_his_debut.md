Matt Lucas left viewers in stitches as he impersonated a bumbling Boris Johnson in his Great British Bake Off debut on Tuesday night. 

The comedian, 46, who has replaced Sandi Toksvig as host, was a spitting image for the Prime Minister as he recreated a spoof press conference with the slogan 'Stay Alert, Protect Cake, Save Loaves'.

Series 11 of the show was postponed by 15 minutes, after Boris addressed the nation with the new lockdown measures in the fight against coronavirus.

In the skirt Matt, who donned a platinum blonde wig and stood in front of a Union Jack flag, said: 'I've talked about this, you know, the printer is upside down again. And oh no.. well… how? Ah, yes well that works actually, I can read that fine.

'Um, right, let's err… yeah. Good evening, let's get straight to it. We are now approaching Phase 46. 

'Which means that from Tuesday morning, or Wednesday evening depending on your height. We are, we are, we are saying with regards to baking if you must bake in a tent, bake in a tent.
