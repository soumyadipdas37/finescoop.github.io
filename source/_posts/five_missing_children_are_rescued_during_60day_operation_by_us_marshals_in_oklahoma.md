A 60-day law enforcement operation in Oklahoma City has ended with the recovery of five missing children and the arrest of six murder suspects. 

Operation Triple Beam  - a collaboration between the U.S. Marshals and more than a dozen other agencies including the Oklahoma City Police Department - commenced July 6, with the aim of reducing violent crime in and around the city. 

Across the next two months, 262 people were arrested, including 141 confirmed gang members. 

Two gang members were taken into custody as part of the operation, accused of kidnapping their own children from a day care center.

Chasady and Charles Hall - who are both reported to be in the Dungee Crip gang - were arrested on August 12 after the alleged abductions.  

At the time, their children were in the custody of the Department of Human Services. The kids are now back in foster care. 

Elsewhere, murder suspect and Surenos gang member Pablo Robledo was also arrested as part of Operation Triple Beam. 

Robledo was in prison awaiting trial for first- degree murder after a shooting in March 2019. 

In July, he escaped from Oklahoma County Jail  alongside his cellmate and suspected cellmate, Jose Hernandez. 

The pair created a rope made of bedsheets and paper and scaled down 12 floors of the prison.

The U.S. Marshals captured him several days later as part of their operation. 

'We used all kinds of techniques and investigative techniques to try and locate him, and once again we were successful in getting him back into custody,' Johnny Kuhlman, with the U.S. Marshals, told KFOR. 

Elsewhere, Dkwon Littlejohn, who is reported to be a member of the Rollin 60's Crip gang, was also busted during Operation Triple Beam. 

He is suspected of burglarizing an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation vehicle and stealing a rifle. 

During the 60-day operation, investigators also seized 72 firearms, 9 kilograms of drugs and nearly $17,000 in cash.

'Our primary goal with operations like OTB is to make communities safer,' a statement from the U.S. Marshals read. 

 'When we arrest these violent fugitives, we are also removing guns and narcotics from our streets. We believe these efforts have an immediate, positive impact on the communities we serve.' 

It comes less than a month after U.S. Marshals completed a 14-day operation in Georgia that led to the recovery of 39 missing children. 

That investigation - known as 'Operation Not Forgotten' - also resulted in the arrest of nine people on sex trafficking charges.
