She was recently said to have moved back to the UK from Los Angeles to raise her children in Britain. 

And Cat Deeley looked in good spirits as she enjoyed an outing with her husband Patrick Kielty and their sons Milo, four, and James, two, in Primrose Hill on Tuesday.

The TV presenter, 43, cut a casual figure for the day, wearing a white top with navy skinny jeans.

The So You Think You Can Dance star paired it with a burgundy leather jacket and a navy scarf as she held hands with Milo.

Carrying her son's jacket, Cat completed her look for the outing by letting her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders. 

Patrick, 49, also opted for a laid back look, wearing a grey jumper and navy jeans for the family day out.

It comes after Cat was reported to have given up her life in Los Angeles in favour of being closer to her family in London.

Last month, the star put her lavish Beverly Hills mansion, which she first bought in 2006, on the market for just under $5million (£3.8million).

A source told The Sun: 'Cat was discussing putting the house up for sale months ago, they didn't want to rent it out because they were considering buying a property in the UK. This is more of a permanent move.' 

'She is a household name, and they both made it work in LA, but Patrick gets a lot more work back home, and she could always fly back and forth when the pandemic eases up.'

Cat will make a hefty profit from the sale of her Beverly Hills home as she purchased it for $2.7million ($2.05million), according to Variety.

The insider added that both Cat and Patrick were 'more than ready for this' as they dream of raising their children in the UK.

The TV star was said to have been planning the move back to Britain since the start of the year and will fly back to the US for work. 

Cat first moved to Los Angeles in 2006 and has presented So You Think You Can Dance since. 

The presenter recently revealed she is 'done' with children and has no desire to try for a girl.

'No, I think I'm done. I love my boys. I can't believe how lucky I am to have them,' she told Closer magazine. 'I'm good, I think. Ask me again in 12 months' time!'

'Being a working mum of two is kind of like a massive juggle, where you throw all the balls up in the air and you try to keep them all up there.'

Cat and Patrick met when they presented Fame Academy together in 2002 and remained pals for almost a decade before making their debut as a couple in March 2012.

They tied the knot just six months later in a traditional Catholic ceremony in Rome, Italy, in September 2012, which was an intimate affair with just six family and friends each.
