Enable is the 1-5 favourite with Ladbrokes for Saturday's September Stakes at Kempton after confirmation John Gosden-trained stablemate Logician will not take her on even though the 2019 St Leger winner features among the nine entries.

Enable will be having what is expected to be her last race in Britain before trying to win an historic third Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe on October 4 while Logician would be making his delayed seasonal debut after illness.

But Lord Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Khaled Abdullah, said: 'They won't run against each other. Enable is very much an intended runner at this stage.Â

'We entered Logician just in case, as he is nearing a return and we're considering a couple of different options.'

Highest rated of Enable's potential opponents is Charlie Fellowes-trained Prince of Arran, who has twice been placed in the Melbourne Cup.

Meanwhile Roger Teal-trained July Cup winner Oxted is 7-2 favourite for Saturday's Group One Haydock Sprint Cup.
