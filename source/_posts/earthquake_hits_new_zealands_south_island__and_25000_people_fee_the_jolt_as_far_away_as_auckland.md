A magnitude 5.7 earthquake has rattled New Zealand's South Island. 

The tremor struck about 10km west of St Arnaud at 10.13pm on Thursday night in the Nelson Lakes Region.

About 25,000 people across the country felt the jolt, including those living as far away as Auckland and Dunedin. 

The tremor struck about 10 kilometres west of St Arnaud at 10.13pm on Thursday night in the Nelson Lakes Region but it was felt by residents right across the country

The quake comes a day before the 10th anniversary of the 2010 Darfield earthquake, which caused widespread damage to the city of Christchurch.

Thursday night's tremor was initially recorded as magnitude 4.4 but was upgraded to a 'strong' even. 

The earthquake struck at a depth of 62km.

Those at the top of the South Island and around Wellington were the hardest hit.

Jacinda Ardern's Partner Clarke Gayford sent his well wishes to residents on social media after the event

Twenty-four people reported an 'extreme' shake, 12 severe and 145 strong, according to GeoNet. 

Jacinda Ardern's Partner Clarke Gayford sent his well wishes to residents on social media after the event.   

'Quiiiiiite creaky the old Prem House during those good shakes, it's sure set off the birds nesting in our ceiling. Hope everyone else is OK,' he wrote. 

One twitter user said they felt the earthquake in Auckland when their couch began swaying.  

Another wrote: 'Small in Christchurch but it was damn unsettling. Felt like it was going to get bigger.'

'I can only imagine how devastating that quake would of been if it was less than 20km deep instead of 62km deep,' another said.  

Many others reference the timing of the event ahead of Friday's 10 year anniversary since the Christchurch earthquakes.

'It was strong in Blenheim! I went through the Christchurch earthquakes and tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of the first one. Got your point Mother Nature!' one woman wrote.
