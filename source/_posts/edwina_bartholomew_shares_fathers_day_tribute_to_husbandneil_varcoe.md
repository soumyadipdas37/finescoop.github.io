Edwina Bartholomew wished her husband of three years, Neil Varcoe, a happy Father's Day on Sunday. 

The Sunrise star, 37, shared an Instagram post that showed Neil cuddled up with the pair's daughter Molly, eight months.

The photo was captioned:  'A start of a bond between father and daughter. Happy Father's Day. I emptied the nappy bin as my gift to you'.

'Always laughing and now squealing, a sound somewhere between a galah and a tiny orange strangled cat,' she said.

Edwina returned to her role as a presenter with Channel Seven morning show Sunrise at the start of June - which is notorious for its gruelling early morning starts.

'Going back to work has been a challenge. I have loved having something "other" in the day but miss our mornings,' she admitted in an Instagram post.
