She welcomed her first child, a daughter named Frankie Violet, in October last year, with her husband Jake Wall.

And on Tuesday, Jennifer Hawkins spoke candidly about the challenges she's faced as a new mother.

The 36-year-old shared an adorable photo while hugging her baby girl on Instagram and wrote: 'One min they are giggling next tears, sleeping well then nope, fussy on the boob then feeding well (aka teething).'

'No day is the same!' Jennifer Hawkins (pictured with her daughter Frankie Violet) has spoken about the challenges of motherhood - but said 'she wouldn't change any of it'

She continued: 'No day is the same. Wouldn't change any of it. So much love for this little cheeky head.'

In the sweet photo shared to Instagram, Frankie is sitting on her high chair while her arms are wrapped around her mother.

Jennifer's post comes after she revealed how her daily routine has changed since becoming a mother.

Last month, the former Miss Universe said that she is learning on the job and going with the flow, just like all new parents.

'The biggest thing I've learnt being a mum is that you can't plan a lot. You just have to breeeeeeathe,' she told Body + Soul magazine.

She also revealed that her sleeping has been seriously interrupted now that Frankie is her new 'alarm clock'.

'I wake up between five and seven AM - depending on when she wakes up,' she said.

'I check in on Frankie. Sometimes she'll just be babbling, happily in her cot. So usually the first thing I do is just get up and feed her. I can't lie!'

Jennifer also loves taking Frankie for walks throughout the day, but their evening routine is by far her 'favourite time'.

'From five - it's bath time, and I have a bath with her, which I love. Then Jake comes home from work, then Frankie goes down from between 6.30 to 7pm and then we have "adult time" - it's important! It's really nice,' she said.
