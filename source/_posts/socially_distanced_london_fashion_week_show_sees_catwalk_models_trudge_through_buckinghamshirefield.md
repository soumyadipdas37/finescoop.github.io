London Fashion Week continued on Sunday with an impressive show that took place on a farm in the Buckingham countryside and features dramatic explosions, drones and colourful smoke. 

Taking place on Missenden Farm in Amersham, north-west of London, models dressed in camouflage and leafy green presented Paria Farzaneh's Spring/Summer 2021 collection.

But only a select few editors and buyers were able to enjoy the multi-sensory spectacle due to coronavirus regulations - which almost completely put a stop to the much-anticipated fashion week. 

It is one of the only shows this season that was allowed a real-life audience, because of Covid rules banning mass gatherings.

Despite the show's idyllic setting, the unsettling performance contrastingly aimed to reflect the current worldwide climate and echo the current tensions in America.

Paria Farzaneh's collection was inspired by utility clothing, with models wearing large jackets and dresses using cargo pant-style pockets and camouflage prints

The show gave a message of resistance as models strutted across the countryside wearing camouflage trousers paired with other utility-inspired clothing.

One striking model wore a large-skirted gown with cargo-pant style pockets, paired with a matching bomber jacket.

The dramatic event featured suspenseful music and firecrackers, which went off like gunshots, as models showcased the new clothing in front of the dramatic backdrop.

Notes distributed at the show detailed how US-based members of Farzaneh's team had been affected during the creation of the collection, the Guardian reported. 

One staff member had to evacuate her home due to the wildfires, and another was pepper-sprayed by police in Chicago. 

The notes read: 'We all share the common goal, creativity runs strong in our blood, and we can't let it go, especially not now.' 

 Farzaneh, 26, is a rising British star in the fashion industry who has previously described her work as 'merely a platform for something bigger'. 

The London-based designer, who has Iranian parents, combines traditional Iranian workwear with styles developed in London to create her fluid collections. 

She often uses handmade Iranian fabrics and plant-based dyes to create her bold and colourful styles. 

The looks were inspired by utility clothing, with the models donning practical walking shoes with green pocketed utility vests and other bold colour combinations
