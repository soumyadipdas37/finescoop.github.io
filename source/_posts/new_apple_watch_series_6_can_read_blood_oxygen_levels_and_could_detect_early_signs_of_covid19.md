Apple has unveiled a new version of the Apple Watch that is capable or reading the wearer's blood oxygen levels via sensors on their wrist.

The new feature works by measuring the color of blood flowing through the body to determine levels of oxygen in just 15 seconds, according to Apple.

Blood oxygen levels are typically used as a measure of fitness and heart health, reflecting how well red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. 

Apple said it would also investigate whether the indicator, together with the Apple Watch's heart rate monitor, could be used to detect early signs of Covid-19. 

The Apple Watch Series 6 was unveiled at the company's virtual ‘Time Flies’ event, which was viewed by nearly nearly a million people around the world, along with a new and affordable Apple Watch SE.  

This model is designed with advanced features of the Series 6, but for more than $100 less than the Series 6.

The event also introduced Apple's new iPad Air with a new chip called A14 bionic and the 8th Generation iPad, which comes with its A12 bionic chip and a 10.2" retina display.

Just as many had speculated over the past week, the firm unveiled the Apple Watch Series 6 with the biggest addition of blood oxygen measurements. Built-in sensors that lay on the wrist are capable of measuring the color of blood flowing through the body to determine levels of oxygen in just 15 seconds

Apple announced last week that it would be hosting a live virtual event on September 15 at 1pm ET, but without any details about what viewers should expect.

Much of the public had speculated this would be the event that unveils the new iPhone, but others suggested it would take place in October due to delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

However, many assumed it would be the unveiling of the new Apple Watch and that is exactly what they got. 

The Apple Watch Series 6 is the first design to come in a stunning blue aluminum finish and the firm's own Product Red, and users can choose from seven new bands when ordered.

The biggest update is the sensors that measure oxygen levels, which Apple is using to partner with healthcare professionals and networks to conduct larger studies.

These studies will investigate how to control asthma to managing heart diseases to monitoring coronavirus symptoms - all using metrics collected from the new Apple Watch

The Series 6 is also 26 percent faster than its predecessors and is equipped with a high-performance dual processor used in the iPhone 11 - just redesigned as a smaller version.

It is designed with Apple's in-house A13 chip and is said to be the biggest update to the device's performance since the Series 4, released in 2018.

The firm has taken steps to a 'greener' path and has created its aluminum watches from 100 percent recycled material. 

Along with the iconic silicon bands, users can now choose from 'Solo Loops,' which is a continues silicon band without the buckles - and the new straps come in seven different colors.

Buyers of the Series 6 will be ready to use Apple's new watchOS7, which Apple unveiled at its World Wide Developers Conference in June.

Along with the updated Apple Watch, the firm announced the Watch SE. This model boast the same features of last year's Series S5, but is only $279 - compared to the $399 price tag of the Series 6.

It has the cellular function, allowing users to leave their iPhone at home and still power the watch, along with the same altimeter, compass, accelerometer and gyroscope as the new Series 6.

Both Apple Watch models are available for purchase today and are set to ship Friday, September 18.

Apple prides its Watch on being a way to help people stay fit and health, so the firm has designed a workout service to do just that.

Called Fitness+, the subscription service costs $10 a month and allows users to stream fitness classes using their iPad, iPhone and Apple TV.

All workout metrics are displayed on the screen and tracked by the paired Apple Watch.

The service will be linked with Apple Music, the tech giant’s music streaming service, to provide playlists for each workout.

The tech giant claims the 8th Generation iPad is 40 percent faster than its predecessor and twice as fast as the top selling Windows tablet.

iPad 8th Generation will start at $299 for education users and is available to order today, with availability on Friday.

Apple kept a tight lid on  the event and may have left those who turned in disappointed that there was was no mention of an iPhone in the run up to 'Time Flies'.

Rumors were abound that it would be delayed due to supply chain issues brought about by the global pandemic.

Production delays in China, travel restrictions worldwide and related issues linked to measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus are behind the delay.
