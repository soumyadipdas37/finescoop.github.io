She always knows how to turn heads with her sensational looks.

And Helena Christensen was sure to set pulses racing as she posed with turtles at the Turtle Conservancy in Ojai, California, on Wednesday.

The Danish model, 51, showed off her slender figure in a green swimsuit as she posed beside the animals during her trip.

Wow! Helena Christensen, 51, showed off her stunning figure in a green swimsuit as she posed at a turtle conservancy in Ojai, California, in snaps shared via Instagram on Wednesday

Helena's ensemble fell off the shoulder and was cut high on her waist to show off her lithe legs as she modelled in the luscious landscape.

Her brunette locks were brushed into a tousled style, and she wore dark red lipstick to accentuate her plump pout while she smiled for the camera.

Gushing about her day out, Helena said: 'Spent the day in the mountains of Ojai at the @turtleconservancy which is a magical sanctuary for hundreds of turtles, some of them on the most endangered list.

'We have to take care of nature and the animals we are so fortunate to live with,' she added, hoping her followers would take note.

Last month, Helena revealed that spending lockdown with her 20-year-old son Mingus had been 'really special'.

The model quarantined with her only child and close friends at her home in the Catskills, in upstate New York.

Speaking with The Telegraph, she explained how they passed time going on treks and watching films, adding that 'being in nature saved me physically and mentally'.

Helena said: 'I was lucky to spend months on end [in lockdown] with close friends and my son Mingus.... it was very special.

'I think nature saved me physically and mentally. Being in nature I realise is as important to me as breathing.’  

Helena shares her son with her ex-partner the American actor Norman Reedus, who is known for his role in The Walking Dead. The couple were together for five years but split in 2003. 

Mingus, who is with the Unsigned Group modelling agency, is also making a name for himself in the fashion industry after walking in several high profile runway shows.
