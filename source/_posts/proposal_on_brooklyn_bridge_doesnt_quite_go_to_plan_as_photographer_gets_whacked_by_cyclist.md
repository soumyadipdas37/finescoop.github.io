Talk about an unforgettable moment. 

A romantic proposal off the Brooklyn Bridge was hilariously upstaged by a photographer capturing the heartwarming moment who was then crashed into by a cyclist. 

The soon-to-be engaged couple are in the full swing of the proposal when their photographer - named Joshua - jumps into the bike lane so that he can snap better photos. 

A romantic proposal off the Brooklyn Bridge was hilariously upstaged by a photographer who crashed into a cyclist as he tried to capture shots

But as he is snapping photos, lunging forward to secure prime shots, a cyclist comes barreling into the unsuspecting snapper. 

The two go crashing to the ground, with the proposing man - Chris Pain - inquiring whether the pair are okay after their little fall. 

Hilariously enough, as he is asking about the two, Pain refuses to let go of his fiancée's hand. 

Luckily the photographer wasn't hurt from the after the bike slammed into him. He jumped back up and resumed taking photos of the proposal

Luckily the man wasn't left alone as his love ultimately said yes to marrying him

'We got that on video,' he shouts. 'We are going to edit that out.' 

The clip comes to a close as the groups tries to regroup after their brief bit of commotion.  

Luckily, Pain wasn't left alone as his love ultimately said yes to marrying him. 

Now that will definitely be an everlasting memory.
