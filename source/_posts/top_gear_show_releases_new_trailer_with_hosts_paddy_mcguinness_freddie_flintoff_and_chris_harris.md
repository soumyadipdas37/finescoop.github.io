Top Gear has released a first look trailer with hosts Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris ahead of the new series.

In the 60-second adrenaline-pumping video, it features Paddy's, 47, dramatic car crash where he lost control of a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo in June.

The upcoming series only resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted production of the hit BBC car show. 

Scary! Top Gear has released a first look trailer with hosts Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris ahead of the new series where it shows Paddy's £250k Lamborghini crash

As well as Paddy's car crash, the trailer shows the comedian risking his life once again in a daring wall of death challenge.

Arriving at the dare-devil stunt, Paddy quips: 'They've gone, "How can we get the ratings? We'll kill them all!"' 

It then shows the Take Me Out star zooming around a motordrome in an old insurance write-off, a Porsche Cayman, as he warns: 'This does not feel good!'  

While Freddie, 42, and Chris, 45, look on in horror as they shout: 'No, no, no!'

Chaos: The upcoming series only resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted production, they released pictures from the set in September with a 500-strong audience watching from their cars and the presenters spread out (pictured) 

Not ideal! In the 60-second adrenaline-pumping video, it features Paddy's, 47, dramatic car crash where he lost control of a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo in June 

Yet this isn't the only dangerous stunt for Paddy and he is also shown zooming across head-first on a zip-wire in north Wales. 

Another adrenaline-pumping challenge sees the trio strapped in chairs to the top of different vehicles as they zoom around empty roads.

Elsewhere in the trailer, the presenters zoom down ski slopes in Cyprus with €30 holiday hire cars. 

Chris is left furious over an electric all-terrain ice cream van called Mr Nippy and built by Paddy.

Danger: It then shows the Take Me Out star zooming around a motordrome in an old insurance write-off, a Porsche Cayman, as he warns: 'This does not feel good!'

Horror! While Freddie, 42, and Chris, 45, look on in horror as they shout: 'No, no, no!'

The trailer sees the ice cream van zooming around in circles on a beach while Chris is left clinging on in the back. He jokes: 'You are a f**king wally!'

In a different scene, the trio test out electric cars in an empty Alton Towers Theme Park with Paddy in a Vauxhall Corsa E, Freddie in a Mini E and Chris in a Honda E.

The most dramatic part of the trailer is Paddy's car crash where he was testing out a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo at Elvington Airfield.

His co-hosts were also attempting to hit 200mph during the dangerous challenge with Freddie in the 1990s supercar Jaguar XJ220 and Chris in a Ferrari F40.

Adrenaline junkie! Yet this isn't the only dangerous stunt for Paddy and he is also shown zooming across head-first on a zip-wire in north Wales

A new form of skiing!: Elsewhere in the trailer, the presenters zoom down ski slopes in Cyprus with €30 holiday hire cars

Furious: Chris is left furious over an electric all-terrain ice cream van called Mr Nippy and built by Paddy as it drives in circles on a beach 

Things take a less dramatic turn when the trio are tasked with staying in their cars, a Volvo S60 Hybrid, Tesla Model 3 and BMW 330 Hybrid, for 24 hours straight in Paddy's hometown Bolton. 

The start date for the new series still remains unknown but it is expected to return later this year.

Take Me Out host Paddy, and ex-cricketer Freddie, were confirmed as the new hosts in 2019 following the departure of Friends star Matt LeBlanc, who had been on the show since 2016. Chris has remained on the show since 2016.

The show came under fire after the shock departure of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond in 2015.

At the time, eagle-eyed fans felt that replacements Chris Evans and Matt were not up to scratch. Chris left after one year in 2016 while Matt remained from 2016 to 2019.

In June, Paddy 'cheated death after surviving a crash when he lost control of his supercar while filming the BBC show.

He had been driving in North Yorkshire when he skidded on oil at a slight curve in the road before crashing. 

Paramedics and police crew were on hand to help Paddy following the incident.

'A bit of oil on a wet road... lethal': In June, Paddy 'cheated death after surviving a crash when he lost control of his supercar while filming the BBC show

A BBC spokesperson told MailOnline: 'During Top Gear filming in North Yorkshire today presenter Paddy McGuinness's car skidded and left the road, coming to an almost immediate stop. 

'Paddy was quickly taken to the production unit base for medical checks and is unhurt. 

'No other vehicles were involved and the Police, who had been monitoring filming, were quickly on the scene to assist. 

'Safety on Top Gear is always the production team’s priority and the vehicle’s speed at the time was within the road’s limit of 60mph.' 

Dream team: Take Me Out host Paddy, and ex-cricketer Freddie, were confirmed as the new hosts in 2019 following the departure of Friends star Matt LeBlanc, who had been on the show since 2016. Chris has remained on the show since 2016 

Original trio: The show came under fire after the shock departure of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond in 2015 

It came one week after the show had resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted the latest series of the hit BBC car show.

In September, shots from the set of Top Gear showed the impressive-looking new format, amid social distancing regulations due to COVID-19.

The BBC released images taken on one of the shoot days, with hosts Chris, Paddy and Freddie stood on stage, two metres apart, with a 500-strong audience watching from their socially-distanced parked cars.

The episode was filmed at the show's race track in Dunsfold, Surrey, after the hosts were forced to leave the studio hangar because of the pandemic.

Top Gear returns to BBC One later in 2020.

Richard Hammond crashes a Vampire Dragster - 2006 

Richard was left fighting for his life after crashing the jet-powered car while going at 288 mph as he tested the vehicle at the former RAF Elvington airbase near York. Hammond was completing a seventh and final run in the car when the front-right tyre blew-out and the dragster veered off the runway, rolled over, and Hammond was left with a traumatic head injury and was in a coma for two weeks. In the year following the crash the TV presenter returned to the show and spoke about the crash on the Jonathan Ross Show, but couldn't remember any of it because of his injuries.

Freddie Flintoff crashes a jet trike - 2019

In September, Freddie revealed he suffered a nasty escape after a high speed crash in a jet trike during filming. The cricket star, 41, insisted he was 'absolutely fine' after his jet trike careered off the road during a race at the Elvington Airfield near York. Freddie reportedly careered his high speed trike off the road as he filmed the high-speed race. Crew members rushed to Freddie - who was wearing a full motorcycling suit and helmet for the scenes - but he emerged with barely a scratch.

Paddy McGuinness' back axel comes off his Pontiac Firebird - 2020

In the latest series of Top Gear, Paddy embarked on the 'original' American Road Trip with Freddie and Chris Harris. He arrived in their start point of Peru with a Pontiac Firebird which didn't have a roof amongst several other problems. When the trio decided to test out their cars on a straight 1/4 mile stretch of road Paddy's car only got a few yards before the back end of the axel came apart entirely and he was forced to abandon the car.

Jeremy Clarkson flips over his Reliant Robin - 2010

In a now famous segment from Top Gear, former presenter Jeremy flipped over a Reliant Robin multiple times. The motorcar journalist was flipping it over to prove that the three-wheeled car could easily tip over. In his Sunday Times driving column Jeremy revealed that he had actually asked crew to tinker with the car 'so that the poor little thing rolled over every time I turned the steering wheel'.
