A giant Wotsit nicknamed Wotzilla has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest puffed corn snack.

The 35-foot long snack was made at the Walkers factory in Leicester and weighs half a pound.  

It measures the equivalent of 164 regular Wotsits Giants which are a new, larger variety of classic Wotsits.  

The giant Wotsit nicknamed 'Wotzilla' broke the Guinness World Record for the longest puffed corn snack

Measuring at nearly 35 feet and weighing 0.56 pounds, the crisp is so large that it needs six people to hold it up 

The crisp had to be baked by hand because it was too large to fit in any of the Walkers' ovens and needs six people to hold it up.

It took a production team of eight people just under two and a half hours to make the crisp which measured at nearly 35ft (10.66m) and weighed half a pound (250g).

Guinness World Records adjudicator Paulina Sapinska said it wasn't every day you saw six people having to hold up a snack. 

The meeting conditions for the Guinness World Record said it had to be at least 10m long and the same width as a standard Wotsits Giant.

Walkers attempted to break the record to celebrate the national roll-out of Wotsits Giants. 

A spokesman said: 'The team used the top secret Wotsits recipe to combine maize with water in upscaled quantitied, and then passed the mixture through a Wotsits-patented snack extruder to form a supersized 'collet' - the name for a corn puff that hasn't yet been baked.  

'Too large to fit into any of Walkers' ovens, it was then baked by hand, cooled until crisp and crunchy and seasoned with Wotsits' secret recipe cheesiness.' 

Officials from Guinness World Records travelled to the Leicester site to adjudicate the feat with help from an independent quantity surveyor who verified Walkers' measurements

Guinness World Records adjudicator Paulina Sapinska said: 'We've seen a lot of size-inspired food entries and attempts before but never have we seen anything quite like this. It's not every day you see six people having to hold up a single snack.' 

Wayne Rowland, from the Walkers factory in Leicester, said: 'When the team called me up and suggested this I couldn't believe it - we're always looking for ways of inventing new, innovative creations, but it's not often you get briefed to make the world's biggest Wotsit. 

'This just proves that size really does matter when it comes to snacking. We're going to get it mounted and display it on the wall at the factory.' 

Walkers tweeted the news, saying: 'WE’RE RECORD BREAKERS! Say hello to the World’s Longest Wotsit - over 10 metres in length.'

Twice the size of a lamppost on a residential estate road (16ft high)

Half a loaf of bread (one pound) 

Around the same as 10 AA batteries (half a pound)

More than an iPhone X (0.4 pounds) 

10 times more than a packet of classic Wotsits (0.05 pounds) 







Many users are questioning the record, saying that Walkers are the only company to make Wotsits so they win the 'World's Longest Wotsit' by default. 

One user said: 'I believe you have the world's record Wotsit in all categories (small, medium, weird shaped) being as you are, the makers of Wotsits.' 

Another wrote: 'No one can beat this as it wouldn't count as it wouldn't be an official Wotsit so why was it made?'

Walkers responded to this tweet and explained: 'It holds the record for longest puffsnack, so it's open to challengers!' 

Another user commented: 'There's a global pandemic but Wotsit have made a 10 metre long crisp so everything is okay.' 

Other users have been quite excited by the news. One said: 'Please ship this to my house thank you.'

A second wrote: 'You gotta love how creative brands and business are getting nowadays.'  

Another commented: 'If you could bring back those cheese and bacon wotsits from the mid '80s I would then be impressed.'
