She finally left The Bachelor mansion on Thursday night after a clash with Juliette Hererra.

And on Friday, Roxi Kenny was pictured out and about in Brisbane following her exit.

The 29-year-old was sporting a large bandage on her calf, indicating that she may have got another tattoo.

She was dressed casually in a black dress, a matching bag, and a pair of Givenchy slides.

 Roxi dramatically stormed out of the mansion on Thursday's episode, after her feud with Juliette.

And the 29-year-old has revealed the real reason she tearfully left the series while speaking to The Courier Mail on Friday.

'There was something said to me off camera that was the straw that broke the camel's back. It hit below the belt,' Roxi said.

The mechanical engineer decided not to divulge what exactly happened, but spoke of the deep impact it had on her.

'I don't think it's important that people know what was said, but at the same time it was the one thing that pushed me that far over the edge,' she told the publication.

Roxi went on to say she was 'disappointed' she let it get to her.

'It wasn't a good environment for me anymore,' she said. 'Juliette had been poking and prodding me all season. What you saw on the show, that's just a snippet of the stuff I was experiencing.'

The revelation comes after dramatic scenes saw Roxi exit the mansion on Thursday. 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
