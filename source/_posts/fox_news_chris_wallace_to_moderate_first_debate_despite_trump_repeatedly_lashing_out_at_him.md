Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will moderate the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it was announced Wednesday - despite a history of public clashes with the president.

Each of the debates will be moderated by a single reporter, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced – the second will be moderated by NBC News White House Correspondent Kristen Welker and the third by senior executive producer and political editor at C-SPAN Steve Scully. 

None of the three journalists were listed as Trump's desired reporters to moderate the debates, which his attorney Rudy Giuliani released earlier this month.

Although a Fox News personality did make it into the lineup, Wallace is one of the only Democratic hosts on the right-leaning news network.

The sole vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and California Senator Kamala Harris, which will take place between the first and second presidential debate, will be moderated by USA Today's Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page. 

The bipartisan commission on presidential debates announced Wednesday that Wallace will moderate the first presidential debate of 2020 in Cleveland, Ohio at Case Western Reserve University on September 29.

The second, moderated by Welker, will be held in Miami, Florida at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts on October 15. Sully will moderate the third debate on October 22, just 12 days before Election Day, at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Notably, Trump and Wallace clashed during the president's most recent one-on-one interview with the Fox News host last month.

Wallace brought into question the cognitive test Trump often flouts to back up that he's more mentally able to be president than Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

'Biden can't put two sentences together,' Trump asserted at the time, claiming the former vice president is mentally unfit to serve in the Oval Office.

'Well, I'll tell you what, let's take a test,' Trump posed a challenge to Biden. 'Let's take a test right now. Let's go down, Joe and I will take a test. Let him take the same test that I took.'

'Incidentally, I took the test too when I heard that you passed it,' Wallace revealed to Trump on-camera during the interview at the White House.

'Yeah, how did you do?' Trump asked.

'It's not – well it's not the hardest test,' Wallace said.

'They have a picture and it says 'what's that' and it's an elephant,' he continued, in an apparent mocking of the president. 

Trump and Wallace had an awkward interaction during the most recent one-on-one last month where the Fox News host said the cognitive test Trump often touts as a representation of his mental fitness is 'not the hardest test'

In April, Trump also lashed out at Wallace in claiming he is a 'wannabe' of his late father Mike Wallace, who was one of the original correspondents for CBS' 60 Minutes

'No no no. You see, that's all misrepresentation,' the president said of the version of the cognitive test that's available online.

'Yes, the first few questions are easy, but I'll bet you couldn't even answer the last five questions. I'll bet you couldn't, they get very hard, the last five questions,' Trump said of the test.

'Well, one of them was count back from 100 by seven,' Wallace continued, adding the first answer: 'Ninety-three.'

'You couldn't answer many of the questions,' Trump said of the Fox News host.

'Ok, what's the question?' he challenged.

'I'll get you the test, I'd like to give it,' the president continued. 'I'll guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions.'

'OK,' Wallace let up.

'I answered all 35 questions correctly,' the president touted again.

Trump also lashed out at Wallace a few months earlier in a tweet where he said he was a 'wannabe' Mike Wallace, who is the Fox News host's late father and journalist who was one of the original correspondents for CBS' 60 Minutes. 

'Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation,' Trump tweeted in April, deploying his nicknames for NBC host Chuck Todd and for the CBS show 'Face the Nation.'

'What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It's a whole new ballgame over there!' Trump posted at the time of his once favorite television news network.
