Meghan Markle put on a stylish display in a caramel Victoria Beckham blouse - just hours after she donned the brown silk version.

The Duchess of Sussex, 39, who has continued to wear the British designer since her move to the US, opted for the £570 pointed collar silk shirt as she made a surprise appearance on the season finale of America's Got Talent.

The royal, who teamed the shirt with a pair of black leather trousers as well as bracelets by Monica Vinader and Cartier, could be seen speaking in a video message to singer Archie Williams, who was wrongly imprisoned for 36 years until his release last year. 

Hours earlier, the mother-of-one wore the chestnut silk version of the Victoria Beckham shirt as she appeared alongside Prince Harry in her Time 100 video, where she encouraged US citizens to register to vote ahead of the November election.

And just last month, Meghan donned a £320 white shirt by the high-profile designer as she distributed supplies, clothes and nappies at a drive-through run by Los Angeles charity Baby2Baby, which provides basic necessities for families in need.

She teamed the lightweight linen fabric, which featured an oversized fit and subtle striped effect, with khaki shorts, Adidas trainers and a face mask by Royal Jelly Harlem.  

And it's not only since being in the US that Meghan has opted to support the former Spice Girl's clothing line. 

The royal wowed in a £950 electric turquoise figure-hugging dress as she made her first post-Megxit appearance at the Endeavour Awards in London alongside Prince Harry on 5 March.

Meghan counts Victoria as one of her close friends, and the designer was seen attending her wedding to Prince Harry alongside David Beckham earlier this year, sporting one of her own designs

Victoria, who is pals with Meghan, attended her wedding to Prince Harry last May, wearing a dress from her own collection. 

And while Meghan previously claimed she couldn't pull off Victoria's dresses due to her 'short torso', she opted for an outfit by the British designer for her appearance at Sandringham.

Meghan stepped out wearing a top-to-toe navy ensemble, opting for a £1,250 v-neck knitted sweater dress from Victoria's Pre-Fall '18 collection, and following the designer's online recommendation to pair it with boots.

The duchess teamed it with a pair of classic knee-high boots from the range, priced at £1,250 and competed the look with a quirky box bag complete with internal mirror, costing £1,550.

Warding off the cold, Meghan completed the look with a matching £2,250 coat from the collection. 

And during the Commonwealth Day service with the Queen at Westminster Abbey on 11 March 2019, the mother-of-one opted for a bespoke all-white ensemble by Victoria Beckham, complete with a chain-print dress, coat, bag and shoes, believed to have cost £9,000.
