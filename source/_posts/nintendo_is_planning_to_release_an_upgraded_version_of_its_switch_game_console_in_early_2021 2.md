An upgraded version of the Switch game console — with improved power and graphics — could be released by Nintendo early next year, a report has suggested.

Rumours of the hardware upgrade to the Japanese firm's popular hybrid console have originated from supply chain sources, Taiwan's Economic Daily News reported. 

Nintendo did release two new models of the Switch last year — one featuring a new chipset that reduced battery drain and a handheld-only version, the Switch Lite.

The release of the hardware upgrade would be accompanied by a series of new game releases, both from Nintendo and its partners, Bloomberg News reported. 

These are suggested will include games targeted at both the casual and 'hardcore' gamer demographics.

A number of major titles previously announced for the Switch have yet to be released — including 'Metroid Prime 4' and an untitled 'The Legend of Zelda' sequel — which could potentially be being timed for release with the new console version.

In fact, the relative sparsity of Switch releases this year could be explained by keeping titles in reserve until the hardware update is ready, argues the Verge.

The hardware update will reportedly include additional computing power and 4K high-definition graphics, unnamed sources told Bloomberg News.

It would be the first major overhaul to the console's specs since it was first put on the commercial market back in early 2017.

Much of the Switch's success has been attributed to the popular life simulation game 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons', pictured, which was released in late March, around the time that countries began implementing lockdowns to combat the spread of COVID-19

Sales of the Switch have continued apace in 2020 — with more than 61 million of the hybrid consoles having been sold up to the end of July alone.

This places the Switch on a par with the Nintendo Entertainment System  — or NES, for short — the 8-bit console which is credited with reviving the flagging home video game market in the mid-eighties.

Nintendo has had a rough few years.

Following disastrous sales of its Wii U console, investors clamoured for the Kyoto-based firm to close down its home console division and focus on smartphone games.

Super Mario Run, the first time one of Nintendo’s iconic video game characters appeared on a device that wasn’t built by the company itself, set download records across the globe when it launched in December 2016.

Super Mario Run topped 40 million downloads just four days - becoming the fastest game to reach the milestone in App Store history, Nintendo revealed at the time.

However, Nintendo shares tumbled after it was revealed only a tiny percentage of players were willing to pay the £9.99 charge to unlock all of the content in the game.

‘Mario is arguably the most popular gaming franchise in the world, yet we see only about 8 percent of those who try the game actually purchasing it,’ Sensor Tower analyst Spencer Gabriel said.

However, Nintendo does not appear to be deterred, with a slate of new mobile games scheduled to launch between now and March 2019.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Nintendo is quietly working on a Legend Of Zelda adventure for smartphones and tablets to launch in late 2018, and Nintendo recently confirmed its best-selling racing game – Mario Kart -- would be headed to iOS and Android smartphones before early 2019.

Elsewhere, the Kyoto gaming company has seen enormous success with the successor to the Wii U, Nintendo Switch.

The home console, which can be on a television or on-to-go thanks to its in-built six-inch touchscreen and detachable Joy Con controllers, has seen enormous demand.

At its most recent earnings call, Nintendo almost doubled its full-year operating profit forecast.

Sales of the all-new console, which includes its own version of Mario Kart and Legend Of Zelda, have exceeded the company's estimates and outstripped those of its predecessor, the Wii U.

Nintendo also raised its year-end Switch sales forecast to 14 million consoles from 10 million.

This new annual target would alone exceed lifetime sales of 13.56 million consoles for the Wii U, which was on the market for about five years.
