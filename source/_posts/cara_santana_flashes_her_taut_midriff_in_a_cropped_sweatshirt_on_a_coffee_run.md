She recently moved on from her split and called-off engagement to Jesse Metcalfe. 

But Cara Santana went solo as she headed out in West Hollywood on Tuesday to get coffee. 

The 36-year-old actress flashed a peak at her toned abs in a cropped beige sweatshirt that matched her Yeezy Slide sandals.

The actress teamed her drawstring top with black wide-leg sweats with two white stripes down the sides. 

She also covered her feet in long white socks as she wore the chunky slides a part of Kanye West's Adidas Yeezy line. 

Most of Cara's famous face was covered in a black reusable face mask and angular black sunglasses. 

The Reunion actress slicked her hair back in an easy bun as she carried her coffee and black leather handbag on her way out.

They were spotted packing on the PDA in Beverly Hills last Thursday, with E! revealing that Cara has moved on.

'Cara has healed from the heartbreak and has moved on. She's truly in a good place,' an insider shared.

Her new relationship comes after she ended her engagement to Metcalfe back in January after he was photographed getting cozy to two other women.

They dated for 10 years before getting engaged in 2016, with Jesse popping the question on a sailboat in New York's Hudson River.

The former couple spent the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown under one roof at the home they previously shared.   

Metcalfe has also moved on with Canadian model Corin Jamie Lee Clark, which is already getting serious.

'They feel like they've been together forever even though it's only been a few months. He's crazy about her,' a source revealed.
