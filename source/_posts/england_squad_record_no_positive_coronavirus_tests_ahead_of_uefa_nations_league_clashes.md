Gareth Southgate has been handed a major boost before England's Nations League clashes after his squad reportedly returned no positive coronavirus tests.

A worrying surge in cases has disrupted the pre-season preparations for several Premier League clubs this summer after players jetted out on holiday, but the Evening Standard have claimed England's stars were given a clean bill of health.

There were fears among figures at the FA that Southgate would be forced to deal with several absentees due to positive tests or players self-isolating after heading to countries notably affected by COVID-19.

There were fears that Gareth Southgate would be hit with coronavirus-related withdrawals

It has now emerged, however, that the latest squad named by the Three Lions boss will be available for selection for the double-header.  

The round of testing is thought to have been held on Monday, before the players reported to St George's Park, and the results have emerged today.

Sportsmail has previously reported that the FA were planning to confirm the identities of the players withdrawing, but not the reasons why due to medical confidentiality reasons.

Southgate has been forced to re-work his group twice for the fixtures against Iceland and Denmark.  

Aston Villa skipper Jack Grealish was handed his first call-up on Monday after Marcus Rashford and Harry Winks pulled out.

Manchester United forward Rashford admitted the games had 'come a little too soon' for him due to a niggling ankle problem, while Winks withdrew without explanation. He had missed Tottenham's two pre-season friendlies on Friday and Saturday.  

The slight reshuffle followed further maiden call-ups for Wolves defender Conor Coady and Arsenal starlet Ainsley Maitland-Niles.

Chelsea duo Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount will also be available to play despite having to quarantine. The two stars were selected in Southgate's first draft and remain available for international duty.

The west London club have been badly rocked by a number of positive cases - with Mount, Abraham, Christian Pulisic and Fikayo Tomori among those in self-isolation. 

They were pictured on holiday on the Greek island of Mykonos before pre-season training kicked off.  

Southgate is thought to have been made aware of the situation unfolding at Chelsea, but will now be able to call upon his full squad.
