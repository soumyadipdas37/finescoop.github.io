Laurence Fox engaged in an outdoor PT session in London on Monday after it was revealed he plans to launch a new political party to fight the 'culture wars'. 

The actor, 42, sported gymwear as he worked up a sweat with help from his instructor in the street. 

Hours earlier, the TV and film star took to Instagram to show off his new 'Freedoom and 'Space' hand tattoos.

The musician donned a pale blue T-shirt, white and neon green trainers, and rolled up a pair of grey trousers.

Ensuring he stayed fit, the media personality exercised using weights on his inclined bench.

His workout no doubt came as a break from planning for his new party, said to be named Reclaim.

Making a statement? Hours earlier, the TV and film star took to Instagram to show off his new 'Freedom and 'Space' hand tattoos 

His new party is said to be named Reclaim, with Laurence posing for his social media snap holding his hands together in fists. He already has a branch of 'English roses' tattooed on his arm and hand.

It's thought 'freedom' and 'space' are what he intends to 'reclaim'. He uploaded the shot, alongside the caption: 'Always'. MailOnline has approached him for comment.

Laurence has already raised more than £5million for the party - having gained the substantial sums from former Tory donors. He hopes to stand dozens of candidates across the UK.

The Lewis star says he wants to provide a movement for people who are 'tired of being told that we represent the very thing we have, in history, stood together against'.

It comes as Nigel Farage has also threatened to launch an anti-lockdown party after criticising Boris Johnson's draconian measures to curb the rise in coronavirus cases.

Among Fox's aims in his new party are reforming the BBC and celebrating Britain's contribution to the world, according to The Telegraph.

In the queue: The party which has not yet been approved by the Electoral Commission

The party is provisionally called Reclaim and has a website named LaurenceFoxParty.

He hopes to launch the party next month and the name is subject to the Electoral Commission's approval.

His website states: 'Over many years it has become clear that our politicians have lost touch with the people they represent and govern. Moreover, our public institutions now work to an agenda beyond their main purpose.

Goals: Among his aims are reforming the BBC, protecting free speech and celebrating Britain's contribution to the world





Backing: Among the early proponents of the new party are Julia Hartley-Brewer, Darren Grimes and Toby Young who said Fox's contribution to politics was 'exciting news'

'Our modern United Kingdom was born out of the respectful inclusion of so many individual voices. It is steeped in the innate values of families and communities, diverse in the truest sense but united in the want and need to call this island home.

'The people of the United Kingdom are tired of being told that we represent the very thing we have, in history, stood together against.

'We are all privileged to be the custodians of our shared heritage. We can reclaim a respectful nation where all are included and none are ashamed to have somewhere to call home.'

He added: 'I have been so encouraged by the support I have received by those wishing to add their voices to this reclamation of our values.

'Our country is now in desperate need of a new political movement which promises to make our future a shared endeavour, not a divisive one. This is now my endeavour.'











Split opinion: Many on social media are divided over the news, with some celebrating an alternative to the current options in politics, while others derided Fox and his views

Fox, who has been a fierce critic of the BBC, sparked controversy when he said suggestions of 'racism' over how the Duchess of Sussex was treated in some quarters was 'boring'.

He also hit out at black and working class actors for complaining about the industry once they have 'five million quid in the bank'.

A Westminster source said the new party is a version of UKIP for the culture wars and believes it could attract hundreds of thousands of unhappy Conservative voters.

Sources close to Fox said the party does not see itself as strictly left or right wing but will be a broad church.

Reclaim so far has three objectives, which include protecting free speech, reforming publicly funded institutions, and preserving and celebrating Britain's cultural history.

Planning has been underway for the last two months and backers include former Tory donor Jeremy Hosking.

Staff are already being recruited for the party after Fox was launched into the political arena after his performance on Question Time in January.

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has also revealed he is considering launching a new party to challenge the current lockdown measures. 

The Brexit Party leader heaped pressure on the Prime Minister, saying the current restrictions are a threat to freedom.

He told The Times: 'We stood aside for Boris Johnson's government, now many are questioning why we bothered.'

He previously lambasted the government's measures, accusing Mr Johnson of adopting an 'authoritarian' response to the crisis. 

The former UKIP tweeted earlier this week: 'The PM says we are a 'freedom loving country', but will fine you £10,000 and send the army in if he likes.

'This is authoritarian – I don't believe his promises on testing or the competence of the government. We didn't vote for this.'
