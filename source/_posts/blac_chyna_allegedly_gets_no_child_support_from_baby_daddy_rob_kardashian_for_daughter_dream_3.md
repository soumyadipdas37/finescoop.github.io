Blac Chyna alleges that she receives 'no child support' from baby daddy Rob Kardashian, 33, for their three-year-old daughter Dream.

The 32-year-old model made the bombshell claim during a recent appearance on SiriusXM’s Hip Hop Nation, where she chose supporting her kids by herself as her 'biggest flex.'

'My biggest flex? I mean, just honestly taking care of my kids by myself as a single parent, but no child support. So that's my biggest flex,' said Chyna, who welcomed Dream in 2016.

Blac Chyna was also indirectly accusing ex Tyga of skipping out on child support, being that she share son King Cairo, seven, with the 30-year-old rapper.

'I don't get no child support. That's my biggest flex,' she reiterated.

Chyna and Kardashian began dating in January of 2016 and, after just three-months together, the pair became engaged.

After announcing they were expecting their first child together, they were awarded a short lived Keeping Up With The Kardashiana spin-off series titled Rob and Chyna.

By October of 2016, the couple were already on the rocks and were reportedly 'living in separate houses,' according to The Sun.

Chyna and Rob welcomed daughter Dream in November of that year, which prompted a brief reconciliation between the pair that fizzled out in February of 2017.

2017 was a particularly tumultuous year for the former lovebirds, which included Rob posting nude images of someone that appeared to be Chyna on his Instagram and accusing the model-turned-singer of cheating.

As for Chyna, she ended up filing a lawsuit against the Kardashian-Jenner clan and accused them of purposely getting Rob And Chyna canceled.

Chyna accused Rob of being 'an abuser' with 'intent on destroying [her], the mother of his baby, who left him in 2016,' according to The Sun. Rob and his family refuted all claims made by Chyna. 

Rob later accused Chyna of 'pointing a gun at his head' and attempting to 'choke him with an iPhone charger' during a brawl in 2016, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly in April of 2020.

Blac first met her other baby daddy Tyga on the set of his Rack City music video in December of 2011, where she acted as one of his video vixens.

The pair became an item shortly after their December meeting and went on to welcome son King in October of 2012.

Chyna and the Ibiza hitmaker became engaged in December of 2012, but they called off their engagement in August of 2014. Tyga went on to date makeup mogul Kylie Jenner, 23, from 2014 until their breakup in 2017.

Aside from her single motherhood, Chyna also took a moment to discuss her transition from model to music maker with SiriusXM’s Hip Hop Nation.

'It's totally different,' she began. '[Being a musician] is totally different than modeling or being on TV because with music you have to let people feel your emotion through a microphone.'

She explained that trying to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs through music 'takes a lot of hard work and effort and emotion.'

Chyna said that she prefers 'the process' of making music to that of modeling and being able to correct any mistakes with photoshop and move on.
