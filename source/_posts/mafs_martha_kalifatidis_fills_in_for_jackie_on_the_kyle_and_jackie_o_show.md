Married At First Sight star Martha Kalifatidis stepped in to host The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday after host Jackie 'O' Henderson called in sick.

Jackie had taken the day off due to exhaustion, having pulled an all-nighter on Tuesday filming the finale of The Masked Singer followed by her KIIS FM breakfast show the next morning.

Martha was an eleventh-hour replacement after usual fill-in host Beau Ryan was unavailable.

New kid on the block: Married At First Sight star Martha Kalifatidis (pictured) stepped in to host The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday after host Jackie 'O' Henderson called in sick 

Martha, 30, was one of the breakout stars from Married At First Sight's sixth season in 2019, and is still dating her 'husband' Michael Brunelli.

When the show began broadcasting at 6am, Kyle addressed Jackie's absence and introduced Martha to listeners.

'Jackie is not here today, so Martha has come in,' he said.

'Jackie did an all nighter yesterday, she did this show then the puppet show [Masked Singer]. She's crashed.'

Jackie is due to return to work on Friday. 

Kyle joked he would 'be nice' to Martha, saying: 'You're going to hold our hand, we're going to hold your hand, and we're going to get through this show.'

The reality star said she had been called by one of KIIS FM's producers at 5:30am, just half an hour before the show was due to go live.

Former NRL player Beau Ryan is the usual fill-in host when Kyle or Jackie take a day off.

While there was no reason given for his absence, he was most likely not able to do the show because he's filming The Amazing Race for Channel 10. 

The Kyle and Jackie O Show airs weekdays from 6am on KIIS 106.5 in Sydney
