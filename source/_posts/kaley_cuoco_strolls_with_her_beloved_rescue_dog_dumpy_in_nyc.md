She is currently back on-set of her upcoming HBO Max series The Flight Attendant after COVID-19 paused production in March. 

And Kaley Cuoco was spotted taking her beloved senior rescue dog Dumpy out on a morning stroll through New York City on Wednesday.

The 34-year-old Big Bang Theory star donned a medical grade face mask and let her lengthy blonde hair flow freely.

Due to the early hour, Kaley decided to stay in her pajamas, which consisted of an oversized white equestrian-themed tee and a pair of cosmic pants.

She slipped her fee into a pair of white polka-dot slides as she kept Dumpy's precious paws off the city sidewalk.

Despite being in her arms, Kaley kept a hot pink leash attached to her pup who looked beyond happy to be in her clutches.  

After taking care of business, Kaley and Dumpy made their way back to their part-time abode.

Kaley recently moved into a newly renovated mansion in Los Angeles with husband of two-years Karl Cook, 29.

Since her and Dumpy are currently residence of NYC, Cuoco launched an Instagram titled 'Dumps Does NY' where she documents all of their adventures in the Big Apple.

Besides keeping her fanbase updated on how Dumpy is adjusting to the East Coast, Kaley has also been using her personal Instagram page to share her hilarious filming-related experiences.

Yikes: According to the starlet, she had set her alarm clock for 4:40am, but it did not end up going off

Earlier in the day, the actress took to her Instagram Story to recall a scare she had with the settings on her iPhone alarm clock.

According to the starlet, she had set her alarm clock for 4:40am, but it did not end up going off.

'I mad panicked! How can I ever trust my phone or anything ever again,' she wrote, before revealing that her alarm never went off because she set it for 4:40pm on accident.

She recalled: 'Low and behold at 4:45pm, while shooting, my phone goes off loudly while we were rolling.'

Despite the alarm debacle, Kaley has been having a blast getting back to work on The Flight Attendant. 

Most recently, Cuoco was seen shooting exteriors for the highly anticipated series in downtown Manhattan.

The new dramatic thriller will follow the titular flight attendant (Cuoco) as she wakes up hungover in a hotel room in Dubai, with a dead body lying next to her – and no recollection of the night before.

The Flight Attendant happens to be based on the best-selling novel of the same name written by author Chris Bohjalian and published in 2018.

Kaley stars alongside Grey's Anatomy alum T. R. Knight and The Haunting Of Hill House actor Michiel Huisman.
