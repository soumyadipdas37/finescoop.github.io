Frederick Fadi Elrezz was arrested on Wednesday after he allegedly attacked two officers with a knife and biting a third on York Street in the Sydney CBD

A policeman (pictured), 40, was allegedly slashed in the head and shoulder by a Lakemba man, 32, on York Street in the Sydney CBD at 12:20am on Wednesday, September 2

The 32-year-old was accused of attacking the three officers after they confronted him after he allegedly harassed a food delivery rider.

A male senior constable, 40, was slashed across his head and shoulder while his male acting sergeant, 39, was slashed on the hand. 

Meanwhile, a male probationary constable, 20, was bitten on his tricep. 

The 32-year-old man was then disarmed and arrested, before being taken to St Vincent's Hospital for assessment. 

Pictures from after the attack show blood pouring from the senior constable's head, covering most of his face.  

A bite mark and blood can also be seen on the youngest officer's tricep. 

The injured officers were also taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where the 40-year-old officer underwent treatment for lacerations on the left side of his head and another on his upper arm and shoulder.

Meanwhile, the 39-year-old was treated for a laceration to his finger and a knee injury and the youngest officer was treated for his bite. 

Soon after the attack, Elrezz allegedly told officers: 'I wanted to kill a cop in the name of Allah', The Australian reported.

He also allegedly said 'Allahu Akhbar' during his subsequent interview.

There is nothing in the 32-year-old's history that indicates he supports extremist agendas or that he has been radicalised.

Anti-terror teams were investigating his background to assess any potential links to terror organisations.
