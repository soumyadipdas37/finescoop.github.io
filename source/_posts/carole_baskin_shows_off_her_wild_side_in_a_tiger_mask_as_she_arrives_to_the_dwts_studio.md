Dancing With The Stars contestant Carole Baskin showed off her wild side on Saturday, as she rocked a Tony the Tiger face mask, ahead of training with her pro partner Pasha Pashkov.  

The 59-year-old animal activist appeared in very high spirits, as she continues to compete for the coveted Mirrorball Trophy on season 29. 

As she sauntered into rehearsal, the Netflix star sported a grey tank top, which featured a pink cheetah pattern, and a pair of black biker shorts.

Baskin, who owns Big Cat Rescue sanctuary in Tampa, Florida, was also toting a flowing beige skirt in her arms.  

Brimming with excitement, the Tiger King star gleefully held up the garment and waved to onlookers. 

Eventually, she slipped off her facial covering, which featured Kellogg's Frosted Flakes' well-known mascot, to flash a bright smile.

On Monday, she made her dance debut, which was, naturally, big cat-themed. 

Opting to perform to Survivor's Eye of the Tiger, Baskin and her partner both wore tiger-prints. 

Unfortunately, she received the lowest score of any contestant on opening night.

While Baskin's performance was less-than-stellar, Navarro College' coach, Monica Aldama, impressed the judges with her promising foxtrot. 

And on Saturday, Aldama looked jazzed, as she also headed into dance practice, while flashing the University of Texas 'hook em' sign at cameras. 

The pair appeared in a playful mood, as they posed for pictures and she showed off her gym-honed frame.

She paired the look with a white t-shirt and bright red sneakers, which coordinated with her partner, Valentin Chmerkovskiy's trainers. 

Her sighting comes after her mentee Jerry Harris was arrested for allegedly 'enticing an underage boy to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself' on Thursday.
