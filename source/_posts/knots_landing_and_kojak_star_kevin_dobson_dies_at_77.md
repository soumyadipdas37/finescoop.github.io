Actor and U.S. Army veteran Kevin Dobson has died aged 77, it has been confirmed. 

The actor was best known for his roles in CBS dramas Knot Landing and Kojak, as well as appearing on Days of our Lives. 

The United Veterans Council of San Joaquin County - where Dobson once served as Chairman - announced the news on Monday, via their official Facebook page. 

RIP: Kevin Dobson has died aged 77, and was best known for his roles in CBS dramas Knot Landing and Kojak, as well as appearing on Days of our Lives

'The United Veterans Council regrets to inform you that our former Chairman and Army Veteran Kevin Dobson passed away this evening Sunday September 6th, 2020 due to medical complications,' a statement read.

Adding: 'Our condolences to his family and May he Rest In Peace. More information will be posted about his funeral services once available.'

The actor was born on March 18 in 1943 in Jackson Heights, New York, and began his working career as a trainman, brakeman, and a conductor on the Long Island Railroad. 

Dobson, the son of a school janitor, is also said to have worked for years as a waiter before finding his true calling as a thespian. 

He got his foot in the door with a small appearance in the classic '70s flick Klute starring Jane Fonda, before landing acting roles in television. 

The New York-native made an impression as Det. Bobby Crocker, Lt. Theo Kojak's young partner in the TV series Kojak, opposite Telly Savalas. 

Hitting the big time in TV, Dobson remained with the popular show for its entire five-season run from 1973 to 1978, and later reunited with Savalas for the 1990 TV movie, Kojak: It's Always Something, where his character had become an assistant district attorney.
