Lindsey Graham said Sunday that the Judiciary Committee will hold its confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett next month and will report her nomination to the Senate floor on October 22.

'So, we'll start on October 12, and more than half of the Supreme Court justices who have had hearings were done within 16 days or less,' Graham told 'Sunday Morning Futures' host Maria Bartiromo. 'We'll have a day of introduction. We'll have two days of questioning, Tuesday and Wednesday, and on the 15th we'll begin to markup, we'll hold it over for a week, and we'll report her nomination out of the committee on October 22.'

'Then it will be up to [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell as to what to do with the nomination once it comes out of committee,' the South Carolina Republican continued.

Graham chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees confirmation hearings for federal judge and justice nominations.

With a Republican majority in the Senate, and Graham's newly announced timeline, Barrett will likely be approved to take the vacant Supreme Court seat before the end of October â€“ and just days before the November 3 presidential election.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said Sunday the panel will vote to report Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee to the senate on October 22 setting up a vote days before the election

Trump formally announced Barrett as his nominee during an event in the Rose Garden Saturday afternoon.

Democrats lament that there should be no confirmation hearings or vote on a nominee until after the election, claiming whoever is victorious in November should choose the next Supreme Court Justice.

The seat opened up last Friday when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died due to complications from pancreatic cancer.

The president touts Barrett, a 48-year-old mother of seven and devout Roman Catholic, as a pure constitutional textualist. And the federal judge said during her brief acceptance remarks Saturday that she will 'apply the law as written.'
