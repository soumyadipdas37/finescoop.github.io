Valencia are preparing a surprise move to sign Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi on loan, according to reports in Spain.

The 21-year-old Frenchman has been absent from the Gunners squad following ugly scenes involving Brighton striker Neal Maupay in their defeat at the Amex last season following the restart after falling out with boss Mikel Arteta.

That appears to have continued into this season after he was left out of the FA Cup holders' Community Shield victory against Liverpool on Saturday at Wembley.

Now Super Deporte claim new Valencia boss Javi Gracia is targeting a move for the France U21 international having failed to raid former club Watford for Guendouzi's compatriot Etienne Capoue. 

The report adds the Spanish side are likely to push for a season-long loan deal for Guendouzi amid their worsening financial situation, but there is the potential of a £22million (€25m) purchase clause being included in negotiations. 

Valencia have a gaping hole in midfield after selling former Gunner Francis Coquelin and club captain Dani Parejo to Villarreal for a combined fee of just £7.1m, and are reportedly looking at Arsenal outcast Guendouzi. 

The Spanish outfit have also raise another £47m (€53m) after selling Ferran Torres and Rodrigo Moreno to Manchester City and Leeds United respectively, with the latter having completed his move during the last week.

The news regarding Guendouzi comes despite Arsenal boss Arteta stating that he has wiped the slate clean with the midfielder and insisted that every player has been given a fresh start for the new season.

Speaking ahead of the Community Shield win, Arteta said: 'I have been really clear that everybody starts from zero. He is going to be part of the team and at the moment he is like any other player in our squad.

'What you did two weeks ago or two years ago doesn't really matter. It's what you are able to contribute to the team now.

'I have told Guendouzi that at the moment he's like any other player in the squad. He deserves to be treated exactly the same and I will do that to the best of my capability.

'Everybody is going to have the same opportunities. They all have to show with their performances and their attitude that they are better than their team-mates and contributing to what we want to achieve this season.'

That has not stopped speculation about the Frenchman though, who has also been linked with a return to his native country with Lyon in a potential swap deal with Houssem Aouar.
