Back in May, Jade Roper confessed that she didn't feel like her family would be complete unless she and husband Tanner Tolbert had a third child.

That wish was granted before the month's end when the couple announced they were expecting another baby, which turned out to be a second boy.  

With their family seemingly now set at five, the Bachelor In Paradise alum more than hinted that her husband may be getting a vasectomy, but not before suggesting a possible longing for another girl.

'We have a name we are both super attached to (for no specific reason) that we love for a girl!' the Mommies Tell All podcast co-host wrote during an Instagram Q&A session on Monday, September 7.

'We are saving it for if some crazy reason we end up having four kids. (Although I'm pretty sure Tanner is going to get the snip-snip).'

A few hours before the Q-and-A with fans, Roper gave her 1.3 million followers another glimpse at her growing baby bump; this time at the 29 week mark.

'You are me. And I am you. And everything else can wait. #29weeks #mamasaremagic,' she captioned two selfie photos of herself sitting on the floor of her home dressed in a rustic-colored bra and underwear. 

For an added touch of style, she also had a gorgeous sheer wrap draped across part of her body and her brown tresses flowing past the middle of her back.

It was May 18 when the Colorado native took to Instagram to publicly announce they were expecting baby number three.

“HERE WE GROW AGAIN,” Roper, 33, gushed at the time.

'Although this time has its uncertainties, we are so thankful and excited for this baby.'

She added, 'We are beyond happy to love another baby, to give Emmy and Brooks another sibling and to have our children be so close!'

Later that same week, Tolbert admitted his wife's third pregnancy 'was not planned' and 'very much an accident.' 

He had previously revealed that he was 'content' with having two children, but then, after learning his wife was pregnant again, the reality star sounded both surprised and joyful their family would be growing again. 

'But now this happens, so we’re gonna have three,' Tolbert, 33, said before adding a hint of his own about having yet another baby: 'I’m like, "What's the difference between three and four?"'     

Jade Roper was a contestant on the 19th season of The Bachelor and Tanner Tolbert was a contestant on the 11th season of The Bachelorette.

They both later appeared and won the second season of Bachelor In Paradise. They would go on to tie-the-knot on January 24, 2016.
