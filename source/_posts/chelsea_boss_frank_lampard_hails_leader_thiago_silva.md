Frank Lampard has hailed the leadership qualities of Chelsea's summer signing Thiago Silva, insisting his presence can already be felt around the club.

The Brazil international moved to Stamford Bridge on a free transfer earlier this summer after leaving Paris Saint-Germain.

Silva took part in his first training session as a Chelsea player on Thursday after having extra time off following PSG's Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich.

It remains to be seen whether Lampard will play the 35-year-old against Premier League champions Liverpool on Sunday but the Chelsea boss was clearly impressed by his new man. 

Lampard said: 'Certainly a leader. He'll bring that with him by nature.

'He doesn't speak the language that great at the moment but we'll work on that. 

'By presence, by attitude in training and quality of the player, he commands respect and it is great having him around. That's all you can ask for as a coach.'  

The game against Liverpool offers an early test of Chelsea's title credentials this season after they spent around £230m in the transfer window to strengthen.

It will also be the first game that Lampard locks horns with Jurgen Klopp since the pair were involved in an angry confrontation at Anfield back in July. 

Lampard insists he has nothing but respect for Jurgen Klopp following their touchline spat 

Lampard accused Klopp’s coaching staff of crossing a line and showing a lack of respect by leaping up, shouting and smirking at him during Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat at Anfield earlier this summer. 

Klopp moved to clear the air in his press conference on Friday and Lampard echoed those sentiments, insisting he had nothing but respect for the German.

Lampard added: 'Against Liverpool they are always going to give you a tough match.

'We have to push our limits to close that gap and that's the challenge in front of us. 

'I reiterate what Klopp said. I've got huge respect for him as a manager and what he's done at Liverpool.

'That's on him as the focal point of the club and the talent they've brought in.

'The nature of the 90 minutes can always boil over but the respect I have for Klopp will never change.'
