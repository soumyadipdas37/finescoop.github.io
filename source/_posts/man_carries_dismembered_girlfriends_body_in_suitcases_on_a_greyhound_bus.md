Melvin Martin Jr., 30, was arrested in Markham, Illinois on Tuesday after his family members discovered the body parts in his luggage about a week after he had arrived

A man has admitted to dismembering his girlfriend's body and carrying the parts in suitcases on a Greyhound bus from Kentucky to his parent's house in Illinois. 

Melvin Martin Jr., 30, was arrested on Tuesday after his family members discovered the body parts in his luggage about a week after he had arrived. 

Police said Martin admitted to killing his 31-year-old girlfriend in Louisville before dismembering her body.

Investigators believe she was dismembered about a month ago.  

He allegedly told investigators that he dumped her torso in a Louisville park and put the other body parts, including her lower half, skull, and organs, into his luggage. 

Martin then took the luggage with him when he caught a Greyhound bus from Louisville to Chicago where he was picked up there by relatives who took him to their home in Markham, which is about 23 miles south of Chicago.  

Markham Police Chief Terry White said Martin took the remains to his parents house because he still wanted to be with 'at least part of her'. 

'He indicated that, as grotesque as it might sound, he still wanted to be with her. At least part of her,' White said. 

Martin allegedly told police he stashed the parts in a suitcase and boarded a Greyhound bus from Louisville, Kentucky to his parent's home (above) in Illinois

Relatives later told investigators that Martin never unpacked the bags and they came suspicious when a foul odor started coming from his luggage. A relative opened one of the bags and discovered the body parts when Martin was at a public library

Relatives later told investigators that Martin never unpacked the bags and kept asking for clothing. 

They became suspicious when a foul odor started coming from the bags. 

When Martin was at a public library on Tuesday, a relative opened one of the bags and found some of the body parts. 

Martin was arrested at the library after his family called 911.  

Police later found the woman's head and other remains in the remaining bags. 

Authorities are withholding the girlfriend's name until they can locate a next of kin. 

They did confirm that she was from Louisville and had been reported missing last week. 

Police said her death resulted from a domestic assault and believe her body was dismembered at least a month ago. 

The woman's torso was located on Wednesday in the Louisville park following Martin's arrest.   

Martin has been charged as a fugitive fleeing prosecution and now faces an extradition hearing back to Kentucky.
