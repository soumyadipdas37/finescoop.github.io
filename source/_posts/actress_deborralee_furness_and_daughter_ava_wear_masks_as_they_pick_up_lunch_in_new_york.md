Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness and her daughter Ava popped out to grab some lunch from their home in New York on Wednesday.

The pair wore face masks and held hands as they carried food in a plastic bag back to their apartment.

Deborra-Lee, 64, and Ava, 15, both cut casual figures as they embraced the city's warmer weather.

The family has been splitting their time between their New York apartment and home in the Hamptons during the coronavirus pandemic.

Last week Deborra-Lee revealed on Georgie Gardner's Drive podcast that she and Hugh have been using this time to reconnect and enjoy the simpler things in life.

She added that the couple start each morning by reading together for half an hour.

'We read something of substance, so it sets you up for the day and we have a bit of a debate,' she said.

'We [also] do meditation, we walk the dogs, we work out and then we start our day. It gives you a structure to hold on to,' she explained.

Deborra-Lee also revealed Hugh has been baking everyday during lockdown, saying: 'He's a big baker. It's his new passion. He bakes literally every day.'
