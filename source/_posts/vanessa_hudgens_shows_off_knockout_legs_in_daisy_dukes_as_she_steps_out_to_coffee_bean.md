Vanessa Hudgens showed off her knockout legs in a loose pair of Daisy Dukes when she stepped out in Los Angeles this weekend.

The 31-year-old slipped into a print T-shirt and popped on a baseball cap to pick up a cool beverage at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.

She was joined by her blonde DJ best pal GG Magree whom she has been frequently spotted spending time with in recent weeks.

GG opted for a plunging Slipknot shirt dress and a scarlet baseball cap, accessorizing with a pair of aviators.

The dynamic duo made sure to take the precaution of bringing masks as they emerged from lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Vanessa swung by her Instagram page this Saturday to turn up the heat with a sizzling picture of herself in an autumnal ensemble.

The Spring Breakers actress took the plunge in a clinging colorful top and threw on a black leather jacket that complemented her dark makeup.

Sliding herself into a black leather miniskirt with an embossed snakeskin texture, she clasped on a tangle of necklaces including a dog-collar-style choker.

Vanessa posted a color photo of the look alongside a black and white one, captioning: 'It’s that time againnnn.'

She and GG have been glimpsed enjoying strolls out and about together, and their social media also shows them exercising and goofing off together.

The singing star went viral this Monday after she put her knockout legs on display this Monday while dancing on Tik Tok with GG.

The gal pals were recreating Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's choreography from the WAP music video and Vanessa was praised for her moves.

Vanessa, who starred in a televised production of Grease, expertly worked her way through the sultry dance routine in the backyard. 

She recently posed up a storm on her Instagram page in full leggy costume as Nicole Kidman's character Satine from Moulin Rouge.

Moulin Rouge was helmed by Baz Luhrmann who is directing an upcoming biopic of Elvis Presley starring Vanessa's ex-boyfriend Austin Butler.

Vanessa was still with Austin when he landed the role and she gushed on Live With Kelly And Ryan last August that she was 'so excited that this is happening for him.'

Elvis' manager 'the Colonel' is played by Tom Hanks, who along with his wife Rita Wilson caught COVID-19 while in Australia for the shoot. They have both recovered.
