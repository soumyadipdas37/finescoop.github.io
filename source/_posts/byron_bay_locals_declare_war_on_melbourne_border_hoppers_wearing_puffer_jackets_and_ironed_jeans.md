Melburnians desperate to escape their city prison have fled to idyllic beach town of Byron Bay - and locals are not happy.   

Fed-up residents have slammed city dwellers from Australia's coronavirus capital flocking to the celebrity hotspot to wait for the second wave to pass. 

Apparently the invaders are typically middle aged men with turned up collars whose eyes are glued to their iPhones.    

Their gaudy Range Rovers, SUVs and Maseratis carrying Victorian number plates have also irked the natives.  

Byron Bay Local and Heartbreak High star, Putu Winchester-Stanton, has launched a scathing attack on the new arrivals.

'You can spot the Melburnians in a second,' he told the Herald Sun's Page 13.

'They just reek of Melbourne. Puffer jackets and ironed jeans. I mean what’s with that?'   

His harsh comments were echoed by another local, artist Kane Latty.

'It was bad enough before the school holidays, but now they all ponce around thinking they're the Hemsworths. Go f***ing home,' he said.  

Some celebs have chose Byron Bay as their temporary home during the coronavirus pandemic.

Baywatch star Zac Efron also relocated to the coastal community sparking fears that the town was losing its 'community atmosphere'.

In a recent post shared to a Byron Bay Facebook group, one local wrote: 'Byron Bay used to be inclusive. If you don't have a tonne of money forget it.

'And by the way, I've lived in Byron Bay for nearly forty years, so it's got nothing to do with tall poppy [syndrome]. It's to do with losing the community atmosphere.

'Now it's all AirBnBs, this is what I don't like,' they finished.
