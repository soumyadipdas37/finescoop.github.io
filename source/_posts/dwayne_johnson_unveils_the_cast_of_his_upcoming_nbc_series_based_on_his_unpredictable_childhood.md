Dwayne Johnson unveiled the cast of his upcoming NBC series, Young Rock, which is inspired by his 'wild and unpredictable childhood and formative years.' 

In addition to revealing the show has 'officially' begun production, the 48-year-old actor shared the three different actors, who will portray him as a preteen, high schooler and in his early twenties. 

'This show is gonna be a fun one and can’t wait for you guys to watch!' the retired WWE wrestler told his 199 million Instagram followers on Wednesday.

Johnson first shared a side-by-side snap of himself posing shirtless in a pair of white shorts, next to a picture of Bradley Constant, who will depict Johnson at age 15. 

'[Bradley Constant] will take the reigns of playing me at 15 and clearly kicking puberty’s ass,' the father-of-three joked of the young actor's chiseled looks. 

In the newcomer's head shot, Constant bears a striking resemblance to Johnson with his defined jawline and muscular build.

Before becoming one of the biggest movie stars in the world or even his WWE debut, the actor was a defensive lineman for the Miami Hurricanes in the early nineties. 

Marco Polo star Uli Latukefu is set to bring those years to life, including undergoing the recruitment process. 

'Playing at THE U - these years were some of my most defining. The highs are incredible, but the lows were critical,' Johnson captioned a image of himself in his bright orange uniform.

The youngest actor playing Johnson is Adrian Groulx, who will play the Hollywood icon at ten. 

The youngster appears to have already impressed Johnson, who described Groulx as the cast's 'anchor' and his 'hero.'

'He’s got the hardest job of ‘em of all playing “little Dewey” - yes, unfortunately that was the nickname my God parents gave me after the weather - as in dewdrops,' Johnson recalled. 

He continued: 'At 10yrs old, I was rambunctious as all hell, was already girl crazy and loved pro wrestling — especially the part when wrestlers would bleed.' 

'This kid, Adrian is my hero because I look back at this time in my life so fondly and how I viewed the world thru my 10yr old eyes,' Johnson explained.  

Beloved mom: Also on his Instagram, he showcased the actress Stacey Leilua, who has been cast as his mother, Ata Johnson and Joseph Lee Anderson, who will portray his late father

'I was blessed enough to help change that hard time scenario around and get her back on her feet,' he divulged.
