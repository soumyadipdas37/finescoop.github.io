Lionel Messi's future is dominating football and one Stuttgart fan has taken matters into his own hands to try to help his club sign the Barcelona star. 

Tim Artmann has set up a fundraising page with a target of €900million (£805m) to try to stump up the cash for the Bundesliga side to acquire the Argentina international. 

And five days since its creation only €262 (£234) has been donated to the cause, but Artmann has revealed that if the target is not met or Messi departs to another club the donated amount will be given to a water charity.

Lionel Messi's future dominates football and Stuttgart fan is taking matters into his own hands

Tim Artmann has set up a fundraising page with a target of €900million (£805m) in a bid to help the Bundesliga side sign the Barcelona star

The description on the GoFundMe page reads: 'We VfB fans are collecting money to pay for Lionel Messi's transfer.

'In the event that the planned amount is not reached on time or Lionel Messi joins another club, 100 per cent of the money raised will be donated to Viva con Agua.'

After seeing the fundraising effort, one Twitter user wrote: 'This is the best thing I’ve seen all day,' while another added: 'Now this legendary.'





Twitter users responded after seeing the fundraising effort by the Stuttgart supporter

Manchester City emerged as the favourites to seal Messi's signature after the star told Barcelona, via fax, he wanted to leave.

In response to the current status of the fundraiser, one fan quipped: 'Pays for the fax machine.' 

La Liga have ruled that Messi's astronomical £630million (€700m) release clause is still active, given that the player did not issue his desire to trigger an option to leave for free before June 10.
