The embattled state of Victoria has recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths.

The welcome infection numbers come after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.

Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, as 59 deaths were announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.

Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown, with the rest of the state in Stage Three - regardless of how many coronavirus cases towns have - had come under increasing scrutiny as the numbers fall.

The lockdown expires on September 13 at 11.59pm, with Premier Daniel Andrews set to reveal the fate of millions of Victorians on Sunday when the government's road map out is revealed.
