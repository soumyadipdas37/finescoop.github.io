Jon Jones has issued a stark warning to Israel Adesanya, claiming he would tear him limb from limb if they were to ever meet in the octagon.

The duo's ongoing war of words escalated once again at the weekend after Adesanya emphatically defended his UFC middleweight title against Paulo Costa at UFC 253.

In his post-fight press conference, Adesanya claimed he still wanted to 'f*** up' Jones when asked about the possibility of moving up to fight at 205 pounds to pursue a second title.

The Nigerian's comments incensed the UFC legend, who fired back on social media by claiming that he would 'literally tear one of your arms off' if he stepped up to heavyweight to fight him.

'You've stepped into the ring over 100 times now, and you're still not ready!?' Jones wrote in a now-deleted comment on Instagram. 'You have a youth advantage and like four times the fighting experience. 

'The truth is you're already my p****, you love being undefeated and you've seen what's happened to everyone else. It raises your stock to mention my name, you're aware of this.

'You don't want real confrontation with me, I'm not gonna just stand there and kickbox with you. I've been preparing for heavyweights, right around now I would literally tear one of your arms off.'

Jones maintains his focus is still at heavyweight but remains open to a fight with the 31-year-old.

It's not the first time the two men have traded verbal barbs with each other, after the pair took aim at one another over Twitter earlier this year.

In April, Adesanya goaded Jones on Twitter by asking him: 'Hey p**** you still there ... @JonnyBones' before Jones responded with a picture of Adesanya receiving oxygen after his sole knockout defeat as a professional kickboxer. 

He accompanied the image with a caption that read: 'Wasting all that good oxygen. Someone wake this b**** up and change his tampon.'

The Nigerian responded by hitting out at the 33-year-old's criminal record and tendency to delete his tweets after he's sent them.

Part of his response read: 'Did he do a post and delete Dwight? I been ko'd once and I never made that mistake again. How many times you been arrested?'

Earlier this month, UFC president Dana White claimed a fight between the two men is certainly on the cards.

With this amount of bad blood between their championship pedigree, it's a fight all MMA fans are dreaming of.
