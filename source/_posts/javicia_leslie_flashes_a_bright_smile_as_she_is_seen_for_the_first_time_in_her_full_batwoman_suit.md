When season two of The CW's Batwoman premieres in January 2021, Javicia Leslie will become the first Black actress to play the superhero in a live-action television series. 

And now, with her debut now just four months away, the 33-year-old actress has been spotted in her full costume on Saturday. 

During production in rainy Vancouver, Leslie looked every inch the leading lady while sprinting away from a sleek black vehicle with her long, fiery-red tresses. 

Ready: Javicia Leslie was spotted in her full Batwoman costume for the first time on Saturday, just four months ahead of her CW series' premiere in January 2021 

Between scenes, a woman held an umbrella over the star, who flashed a bright smile under the iconic Batwoman winged-mask.    

Despite wearing the same cape and cowl Ruby Rose's Kate Kane wore in the first season, Leslie previously promised that her Ryan Wilder character will put her own personal touch on the Batsuit. 

'Look out, Gotham, I'm suited up and ready to go,' the Maryland native wrote in the caption of her Instagram post on Friday.

DC Comics also shared the image of Leslie in costume on Twitter, writing: 'She's here to protect Gotham. Get a first look at @JaviciaLeslie as #Batwoman.' 

In the promo photo, the heroine can be seen flashing a stern and focused look into the camera. 

In season one, Rose's Kate Kane set out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of Gotham City as Batwoman, some three years after the disappearance of her cousin Bruce Wayne/Batman.

Kane's disappearance will be written into the story in season two, which will portray Ryan Wilder as likable, messy, slightly goofy and untamed.

Like Kane, Wilder be an out and proud lesbian, with her own personal issues that includes being a drug runner who has crossed paths with the GCPD in the past.  

Leslie, who's best known for her roles on God Friended Me and The Family Business, sounded proud and humble when she addressed some of the responsibilities that come with such a high-profile role as Batwoman.

'I am extremely proud to be the first Black actress to play the iconic role of Batwoman on television, and as a bisexual woman, I am honored to join this groundbreaking show which has been such a trailblazer for the LGBTQ+ community,' Leslie said in a statement in July.  

Earlier this month, she gushed that when she 'read the character description' it was 'definitely' her. 

'I loved the idea that it's like goofy meets bada** meets a person who doesn't like to be told what to do, a person who does not like to follow the rules,' she told EW. 

Additionally, she revealed portraying a Black superhero has been her lifelong dream.
