In a new preview for The Bachelor shared on Tuesday, Locky Gilbert plays a very racy game with the girls. 

First he's asked, 'Is there anywhere you don't want to be touched?' to which the hunk replies, laughing, 'No go for gold!' 

The 30-year-old is then stripped down to his underwear and blindfolded while the women leave their mark on his body. 

Woo! In a new preview for The Bachelor shared on Tuesday, Locky Gilbert (pictured) plays a very racy game with the girls

First in was Bella Varelis who applied lipstick in a mirror before approaching Locky's chest. 

The 25-year-old marketing professional then left a lipstick kiss seductively on his chest. 

Next in was Irena Srbinovska, 30, who also left a mark on Locky's chest, but one with a little more meaning.

Smooch: First in was Bella Varelis who left a lipstick kiss seductively on his chest

'I decided to paint a heart, which was a symbol of when we first met on the red carpet,' she said. 

When Bella caught wind of what Irena had done she was enraged.  

'Hang on a second, I also left a mark on Locky's chest. My whole body was fuming,' she said.

Cute! 'I decided to paint a heart, which was a symbol of when we first met on the red carpet,' she said

Later in the clip, Bella is seen at the dinner party, ragingly angry, and decides to confront Locky.  

'I decided to say something to Locky because it seems like she's getting into his head,' she revealed. 

Locky was having none of it, saying:  'I am actually pretty pretty upset, I have seen a side of Bella I didn't think I would see'. 

Angry: When Bella caught wind of what Irena had done she was enraged. 'Hang on a second, I also left a mark on Locky's chest. My whole body was fuming,' she said

'I dont want her to get between us. I'm petrified I am going to lose him,' Bella insisted. 

Locky is then shown insisting they go back to the party, while Bella tries to make him stay with her.

'I really hope it's not too late,' a distressed Bella says at the end of the clip.
