Shopbop's Fashion Director Caroline Maguire reveals fall's top denim styles

Other than pumpkin spice lattes, there's nothing more 'fall' than a crisp new pair of jeans to style with a chunky knit sweater. 

As businesses across the country start to re-open following the COVID-19 shutdown, it's officially time to shop denim.  

Not sure you're ready to squeeze into a pair of skin-tight bottoms after months of leggings, pajama pants and sweats?

Good news! Shopbop's Fashion Director Caroline Maguire reveals the season's top denim trends, and they are not only chic but comfortable!

According to Caroline, the top denim silhouettes this season are high-rise, wide leg and tapered.  Statement making styles, Bermuda shorts and jumpsuits are also all the rage. 

Unlike mid-rise silhouettes that rest below your belly button and cut you in half, high-rise denim with a little bit of stretch works with the body .

'The leg lengthening and waist defining jeans make for a sleek, versatile, and flattering look,' said the expert. 

'I style mine with a simple bodysuit and a statement blazer for a powerhouse outfit.'

Sure, they go with everything but not all jeans needs to be basic.  

'We are thrilled to see statement denim back for the season,' declared Caroline.

'Think topsy-turvy tailoring, eclectic and exciting washes, and enhanced designed details.' 

AGOLDE's paperbag utility jeans in acid wash (on Shopbop) can make the simplest tee look street style fab.

Jeans have been around since the 1800s and they've undergone a lot of changes. In the 1970s they peaked saturation in the form of a jumpsuit. 

Seventies-inspired styles are a huge inspiration this fall, with roomy denim jumpsuits reigning supreme.

'They are really a no-brainer outfit, requiring minimal effort and delivering a major cool factor,' said Caroline.

'You can expect to see this trend evolve over the coming months with different fabrications, silhouettes and unique details,' she added.

Gained the Quarantine 15? No problem! The big and baggy denim styles of the '90s are back! 

'The minimalistic design of a loose fitting wide leg jean allows for a relaxed, comfortable and polished look.'   

For those that like a slimmer silhouette, Caroline revealed that tapered denim is also hot right now. 

'It is roomier at the hip and narrow through the ankle, creating a flattering shape. It’s the perfect style to pair with combat boots for a practical, yet chic look.'

Our wardrobes have become seasonless. By choosing versatile pieces, you can style them in a way that's suitable for the temperature - shorts included!  

'I am currently obsessing over the longer Bermuda-style denim cutoff short for a perfectly casual end-of-summer look.

'I like to pair them with a vibrant tie dye top, oversized sunnies, and a comfortable sport sandal.'

While almost every '90s trend has resurfaced in the last couple of years, low-rise jeans are nowhere in sight.

According to Caroline, high-waisted styles are dominating the fashion landscape.

'We are seeing brands reinvent this timeless trend through updated silhouettes – from pegged styles to distressed hems or even intricate crisscrossed hardware. 

'I’ll style a cinched high-waisted jean with a narrow belt and graphic tee for a simple yet elevated look. 

'Heading into colder weather, I love pairing high-waisted denim with a novelty cropped sweater – it’s cozy and practical.'

'For a more exaggerated or evening look, I’ll style a high-waisted pegged jean with a balloon sleeve puff shoulder and a bold bag to complete the outfit.'

While Levis and Jordache will always be classic, Isabel Marant, MOUSSY and Nili Lotan, are the ones to watch.

'These designers continue to push the envelope with their updated interpretations of denim staples,' revealed Caroline.

'From harem-peg style silhouettes to tapered bottoms and new prints and washes, these designers are continuously rethinking and pushing the entire denim space forward.'
