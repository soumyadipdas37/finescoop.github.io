Alex Jones fell for John Cleese's prank on The One Show on Friday.

The host, 43, was left baffled when the Fawlty Towers actor, 80, stormed off mid interview telling her 'why bother?' after they aired a lengthy preview of him covering his time on the comedy. 

Appearing via a live video link, John said to Alex and her co-host Amol Rajan: 'Can I ask you something?

'Why do you bother to have me on the show?' To which Alex replied: 'Well, we invited you. Didn't we?'

Taking about the preview segment, the comedic actor replied: 'No, that was really good what you put together – it was very informative, and I just want to thank you and say what a pleasure it's been'.

He then  got up from his chair and pretended to leave the room. 

While Amol watched open-mouthed, Alex managed to keep the commentary going despite looking shocked.

'There he goes off he goes, he's going back to watch the cricket. That's what he was doing earlier,' she said.

John later returned back to his seat and told the duo: 'It was a very good little piece. Congratulations!  

'I don't know what else I can add. What do you want to ask me?'

The TV presenter interviewed Max George after he was announced as one of the contestants on this year's Strictly Come Dancing. 

After a brief chat about the show, Alex appeared to forget about current guidelines around social distancing as she leaned in and touched Max's arm and patted him into the lift.  

Viewers quickly took to social media to hit out at the host for forgetting about the current rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

One user said: 'Alex touching Max just then so much for distancing,' while another added: 'Back in the lift, touch him on the arm, no 'distancing' Alex'. 

Another viewer said: 'Oh dear, Alex Jones *touched* Max George. They'll be letters!'
