Officers found and seized a 3D-printer as well as a semi-automatic pistol, which was allegedly made up of 3D-printed parts and components imported from the US.

They allegedly also found additional 3D-printed firearm parts, ammunition, electronic devices and cannabis.

Police seized the items for further forensic examination.

The 32-year-old was taken to Newtown Police Station where he was charged with manufacturing a pistol without a licence, possessing an unregistered firearm, not keeping the firearm safely and possessing ammunition without a licence.

Detectives from the State Crime Command's Drug and Firearms Squad established Strike Force Myosoti in November 2018.

The strike force was tasked to investigate the movement of firearms across Australia.

Through ongoing investigations, police became aware of information about the importation of firearm parts from the US through registered post.

Inquiries led officers to the 32-year-old man, who was refused bail and will appear at Newtown Local Court on Wednesday.

Investigations are continuing.
