A furniture removalist has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for moving a getaway car used in the daylight execution of former bikie kingpin Mick Hawi. 

But in a quirk of fate, the friend that Ahmad Doudar, 40, accepted had shot Hawi dead as part of his guilty plea - Yusuf Nazlioglu - has been found not guilty of murder.

Father-of-one Doudar was sentenced on Thursday after admitting to being an accessory after the fact to Hawi's murder.

Hawi was climbing into his Mercedes AMG 4WD outside Fitness First Rockdale on February 15, 2018 when he was shot several times in the head and torso.

A jury found Yusuf Nazlioglu (left, shirtless) not guilty of Hawi's murder a week ago. Ahmad Doudar (right) pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to Hawi's murder

The brazen executioners, face obscured by balaclavas, escaped while Hawi died of a brain injury in hospital. 

Doudar's role in the crime involved him picking up a hidden silver Aurion with a tow truck and intending to dispose of it, alongside others, the court heard. 

Justice Robert Allan Hulme said on sentencing today: '(Mr Doudar) intended to assist in disposing of the vehicle in order to assist' in the murder.

A week ago, accused shooter Nazlioglu, 39, and alleged getaway driver Jamal El-Jaidi, 32, were both found not guilty of murder by a jury, following a week of deliberations. 

Doudar was not called to give evidence at their trial. 

In handing down his sentence today, Justice Robert Allan Hulme said Doudar's plea of guilty and the facts he had agreed to indicated he knew 'the brazen and brutal executioner.'

'The murder itself was horrifying. It was a dangerous and violent public execution. Mr Doudar knew this.' 

Hawi's wife Carolina Gonzalez gave a 'very moving account' of the grief she and her family have suffered during Doudar's sentencing

The judge said murders like this 'do not happen by chance... they require the involvement of multiple people.'  

Doudar's motive remains unknown. 'For all I know, Mr Doudar may have been motivated by one or more other purposes,' the judge said.

Hawi's wife, Carolina Gonzalez, sister Zeinab and parents Ahmad and Nahdi read statements at a sentencing hearing.

They gave 'very moving accounts of the loss and grief that has resulted from the taking of their loved one in the most horrendous of circumstances.'

Doudar was jailed with a non parole period of three years and four months.  With time served, he will be eligible for parole at the end of 2021.
