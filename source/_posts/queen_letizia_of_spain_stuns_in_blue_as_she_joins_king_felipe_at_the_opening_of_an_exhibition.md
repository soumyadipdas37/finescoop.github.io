Queen Letizia of Spain stunned in a royal blue midi dress as she joined King Felipe at the opening of an exhibition for the Spanish writer Miguel Delibes tonight.

The Spanish royal, 48, arrived alongside her husband, 52, at the event at the National Library in Madrid, with the couple donning protective face coverings for the grand opening.

Queen Letizia opted for a midi length blue dress for the occasion, matching the stunning gown with a simple navy bag and set of heels. 

Miguel Delibes was a Spanish novelist, journalist and newspaper editor who became one of the leading figures of post-Civil War spanish literature, winning numerous literary prizes before his death in 2010.

The mother-of-two opted for a relaxed midi dress for the occasion, pairing her stunning blue gown with navy accessories 

The mother-of-two appeared effortlessly elegant in the blue gown, which featured ruched detail and floral embroidery on the bust and a pleated skirt.  

Letizia kept her smooth locks loose in a bouncy blow-dry and sported a dash of mascara and eye-shadow to compliment her natural glow. 

She wore little jewellery, apart from a favourite ring and a pair of silver hoop earrings, which matched her belt. 

Felipe VI looked dapper in a navy suit and a crisp white shirt. His navy tie was reminiscent of his wife's outfit.

The exhibition is opening on what would have been the author's  100th birthday held at the National Library in the city. 

It comes amid a busy period for the royal couple, with Queen Letizia and King Felipe marking the 125th anniversary of local paper El Heraldo de Aragon (Aragon Herald) earlier this week at the newspaper's headquarters. 

Felipe VI praised the newspaper's 'integrity' and 'dedication to inform' as he and his wife received the Extraordinary Heraldo 125th Anniversary Award to mark the event, the newspaper reported.

Looking in her element surrounded by journalists, Letizia, who used to be a reporter and newsreader, went for a co-ordinated look, matching her accessories to the dashing pink dress, which she first wore in July 2019. 

Days before, Queen Letizia headed to the Nuestra Señora del Patrocinio College in Milagro, Navarra to mark the start of the Spanish academic year.  

Wearing a pair of stylish black culottes and a grey top, the Spanish royal toured the premises with school staff, who were also wearing masks.

The Spanish school term began last week on Wednesday 9 September and saw Letizia's owner daughters return back to school after months of studying from home.

However, it was not long before a classmate in Princess Leonor's year tested positive to the virus, sending the royal sisters into a two-week-long quarantine period. 

It was said at the time that Leonor and Sofia would have to take coronavirus tests themselves.
