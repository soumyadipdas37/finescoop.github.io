Phillip Schofield admitted he was 'terrified' as he watched his co-host bash a piñata full of sweets to pieces during Wednesday's episode of This Morning.

The TV presenter, 58, told Holly she 'scared the hell' out of him, after she smashed the piñata to the floor with one strike before repeatedly beating it.

After witnessing the moment, Phil explained it was a first for Holly, and said: 'You just scared the hell out of me. I’ve never seen you like that!'

The game took place during a Halloween themed segment with Alison, as she discussed games at home for children during the spooky season.

But the star left viewers and the hosts stunned as he accidentally turned the air blue as he let slip a swear word.

Speaking via video link from North London, Grayson happily plugged his new TV project, which sees him travel across the US and explores the divide across the country.

He also opened up about his time in therapy and suggested that people need to be more sympathetic to others as several of us carry 'baggage'.

He explained: 'It helps me understand my own lens... we all carry a lot of baggage and we've got to have a lot of sympathy to that baggage... I think therapy is the most... 'no bullsh**' place I've ever been.'
