He shed an impressive two stone during a two-week juice retreat last month.

And James Argent appeared to be in good spirits as he visited Stephen Bear's new tanning salon Bronzing Bear in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, on Saturday.

The TOWIE star, 32, showed off his slimmed-down physique as he put on a casual display in a long-sleeved black top and shorts.

James completed his look by stepping out in a pair of black slip-on shoes that he paired with white socks.

The reality star wore his cropped brunet locks in a tousled style, and he put on an animated display as he left the tanning salon to pose with the bear statue outside. 

James was seen catching up with Ex On The Beach star Stephen, before he made his way to his moped that had a learner's sticker on the front.

Arg revealed he transformed his eating habits and lost two stone when he went on Jason Vale's retreat in Portugal in August after randomly bumping into the health and fitness guru, 51.  

The TV star told The Sun on Sunday: 'I met Jason on the off chance and he called my bluff when I said I'd book in. So the next day I bought my flights and flew to his resort in Portugal. All I drank for a fortnight was juices. 

'I feel incredible and I'm determined to lose even more weight. I saw pictures of myself on the beach when lockdown ended and I came to Spain. I was shocked by how I looked. Now I just never want to go back to feeling that way.'  

'It was the best thing I've ever done. I've struggled with my weight for years but this has really changed my outlook. I'm free from drink and drugs still, which is a huge achievement. And making sure I lose weight and get healthier is an ongoing goal.'

The media personality had previously insisted the secret behind his epic five-stone weight loss earlier this year was low-calorie curry.

Last year, James suffered two near-fatal overdoses at his home, with his then-girlfriend Gemma Collins calling emergency services after his family feared he was dead. 

The Essex native turned his life around and is continuing his recovery after he flew to Thailand earlier this year to go to rehab for his drug and drink addiction.

Things for James haven't been as promising in the romance department as he broke up with his partner Gemma, 39, earlier his summer after she revealed a string of abusive messages, purportedly sent to her by him prior to their split.

It's understood the Jump star had made derogatory remarks abut her weight after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner.  

The self-proclaimed diva decided to take some time off social media, citing that she was 'devastated' and 'heartbroken' by the exchange.

However after returning to the UK from her own Tenerife getaway, Gemma apologised to her former beau for releasing the messages.
