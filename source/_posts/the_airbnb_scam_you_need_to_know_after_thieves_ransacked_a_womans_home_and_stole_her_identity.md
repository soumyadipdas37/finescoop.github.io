Thieves ransacked a holiday home and took off with thousands of dollars worth of goods before stealing the owner's identity.

Rachel used Airbnb to lease out her townhouse in Brisbane for five years without any issues.

But her latest guest pulled off a heist over their five-day stay, taking off with 170 items totaling almost $18,000. 

When the guest left, she discovered her home had been turned upside down, with possessions strewn across the property and all her valuable items missing.

When the property owner Rachel arrived to her Brisbane home she discovered she had been robbed by her Airbnb guest

'I've been violated, I've been offended, invaded, I've been taken advantage of, abused, it's just horrific,' she told A Current affair. 

'I felt like I was in a dream, I felt this was happening to someone else, this couldn't be real.' 

She had given the guests full access to her own home, which she rented out for extra income while house-sitting. 

When they made the booking she approved their stay despite their profile lacking a picture to prove their identity.

But Rachel said she went ahead with the booking anyway because she trusted Airbnb's verification process for users.

'Remember Airbnb's meant to verify all Airbnb users with three forms of Government ID so even though there was no photo, I had to assume he had been verified by Airbnb and it wasn't mandatory to have a photo anymore,' she said. 

She even communicated with the guest via text message while they were carrying out the robbery to confirm they were enjoying their stay.

But after checkout she realised she had been scammed, and to make matters worse they had managed to steal her identity from documents they found on her old laptop.

They used this to try to purchase a $5,000 car on eBay and also ordered a new credit card to her mailing address.

A rental car was also hired in her name and never returned.

Her mother's share portfolio was also compromised during the process.

The homeowner said she was devastated when she realised the extent of the damage.  

'I opened up my home and my heart to this vile person who indiscriminately chose to destroy, potentially the rest of my life, I've got no idea how long the ramifications will go on,' Rachel said.

'I believe he's a sociopath, he has no conscience whatsoever, doesn't give a darn about how the victim will feel.'  

Queensland Police is investigating whether the scammer is a repeat offender, moving from home to home and using stolen identities to book their next property.

Meanwhile Airbnb has defended its policies and says customer safety is its top priority

Airbnb defended its policies and says customer safety is its top priority.    

'Airbnb has zero tolerance for such illegal activity and we take reports extremely seriously,' Airbnb's head of public policy Derek Nolan said.

'While negative incidents are extremely rare, we nonetheless remain vigilant and work diligently to find new ways to further improve our safety measures and support the vital work of law enforcement.'

Rachel has lodged a compensation claim for her stolen goods through the platform's Million Dollar Host Guarantee.
