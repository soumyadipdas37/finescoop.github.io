Nikki Bella recently got real about her postpartum weight-loss journey, weeks after welcoming her first child.

And the two-time WWE Divas Champion is walking the walk, staying active with some good old fashion retail therapy.

She rocked some skintight black activewear Tuesday, as she stepped out with fiancé Artem Chigvintsev and their newborn son Matteo Artemovich for lunch and shopping in Sherman Oaks, California.

The 36-year-old sported a black tank top with matching leggings, paired with chunky white sneakers and a blue shirt wrapped around her waist.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of black clubmaster sunglasses and a matching black face mask.

Nikki and Artem, 38, took baby Matteo, one month, to lunch at Sweet Butter Kitchen, before they shopped for baby clothes at Juvenile Shop.

They welcomed their first child on July 31, announcing the news on Instagram: '7/31/2020 Our baby boy is here and we couldn’t be HAPPIER and more in LOVE! Everyone is safe and healthy.'

She gave birth just a day before twin sister Brie Bella, 36, welcomed her own son Buddy Dessert, one month, also sharing daughter Birdie Joe, three, with husband Daniel Bryan, 39.

Nikki posted a candid video Monday to her Instagram Story, putting her postpartum body on display, while opening up about her weight-loss journey. 

She said: 'This was really hard to do, but I felt like it was the right thing to do because I feel like sometimes on social media, and people sometimes in the spotlight, we just truly don’t showcase how hard postpartum can be and the journey of getting your body back.'

Goal weight: The Total Bellas star revealed that she's 18 pounds away from her pre-pregnancy weight, but also admitted part of the weight gain was due to her quarantine indulgence

The Total Bellas star revealed that she's 18 pounds away from her pre-pregnancy weight, but also admitted part of the weight gain was due to her quarantine indulgence. 

She added: 'I want to blame so bad COVID and being in Arizona with a lot of heat that I didn’t get to workout like I used to. But no. I indulged in pizza quite a bit especially towards the end and baked goods. 

'I have to take full accountability, so I am now in a journey to lose 18 pounds, but in the most healthiest way possible because I’m breastfeeding obviously, and giving my son the most amazing nutrition is No. 1, so there’s going to be no crash-diets, no starving myself.'

Nikki later gave a glimpse at her postpartum fitness routine, posting a compilation TikTok of herself breaking a sweat in a black sports bra and matching leggings.
