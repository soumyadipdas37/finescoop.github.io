A man was fatally shot execution-style in the head and neck just steps away from a Bronx school after getting into a heated argument with his attacker on Thursday afternoon. 

The grisly incident took place at around 4.30pm outside a bodega on East 141st Street at Cypress Avenue in the Mott Haven neighborhood, directly across the street from an elementary school. 

According to police and an eyewitness, 33-year-old Felix Medina had gotten into a verbal dispute with another man.

Medina was arguing with another man outside the La Victoria deli on East 141st Street at 4pm on Thursday when the dispute took a violent turn 

A witness said a suspect pulled a gun from his bag and opened fire, shooting Medina in the head and neck in broad daylight 

When Medina turned away, the suspect reportedly reached into his bag, pulled out a gun and opened fire, striking the victim in the head and neck.  

According to the unnamed witness speaking to New York Daily News, the gunman continued firing on Medina after he collapsed mortally wounded to the ground. 

'It was execution style. He shot him in the back of the head and kept shooting to finish him,' the witness told the paper. 

Police have not said how many times the victim was shot, but photos taken at the scene show at least eight orange evidence markers dotting the blood-stained ground outside the La Victoria convenience store. 

The witness said that after the shooter walked away, he rushed to Medina to render aid, but it was too late.

Medina's brother, also named Felix, described his sibling as a devoted father of a 10-year-old boy who lived in the Mott Haven community and was loved by everyone. 

'He was a good man,' the brother said. 'We’re all grieving.'

As of Friday morning, no arrests have been announced in this case.
