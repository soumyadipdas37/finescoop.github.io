'If I conclude thing went wrong then I shall say so but we are not looking for scapegoats. We are searching for the truth.

'The explosion killed 22 people, including children. The youngest was eight years old.

'Salman Abedi blew himself up in the explosion but he intended as many people as possible would die with him.'

Sir John said some evidence must be heard in secret to prevent further similar terrorist attacks.

He said the role of the security services and what was known about Salman Abedi and the response of the emergency services will also be considered.
