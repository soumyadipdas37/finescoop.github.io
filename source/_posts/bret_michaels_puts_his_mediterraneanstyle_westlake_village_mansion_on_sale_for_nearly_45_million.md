Bret Michaels is ready to move on from his home in Los Angeles County's Westlake Village.

The 57-year-old Poison frontman has put his suburban Mediterranean-style home up for sale for $4.495 million, according to Variety.

The hair metal icon originally purchased the home in 2015 for $3.49 million, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.

The property is ideal for anyone looking for privacy, thanks to its gates and tall hedges.

The 6,683 square foot property is located at the end of a horseshoe-shaped driveway decorated with palm trees and rests on 2.5 acres.

Michaels, who hosted the VH1 dating series Rock Of Love, has added some of his hair metal touches like a Cheetah print carpet going up his elegant curved staircase and a white baby grand piano.

The home features six bedrooms and six bathrooms, as well as a powder room.

The cheetah print carpet makes a reappearance in the study, which features lovely built-in shelves and cabinet and has an excellent view of the yard.

Michaels' sunken living room is decorated with a thick shag carpet and featured French doors exciting to the back yard, along with a cozy fireplace.

In place of a standard dining room, he converted it into a games room with a pool table and some of his guitar memorabilia.

Home theaters are a common touch for celebrities, but Michaels decorated his modest brown space with posters from some of the films he was featured in, and he included a plush bean bag chair designed to look like a boulder.

After enjoying a film, guests can be entertained at the bar, which featured plenty of sitting space, as well as an other large TV and fireplace and some of the musician's classic guitars lining the wall.

Michaels' kitchen includes double sinks and an island for casual snacking, as well as an intimate circular table by the windows with excellent views of the property.

The master suite has plenty of space and its own fireplace, as well as striking vaulted ceilings.

New inhabitants looking to stay in shape without leaving the grounds will get plenty of use out of the mirrored exercise room, which the singer stocked with exercise machines and weights.

The grounds, which are dotted with palm trees and other tropical plants, feature multiple covered patios, ideal for entertaining outside on a sunny day (or the rare rainy afternoon).

There's also a long pool to cool down in after a long day.

Michaels (born Bret Michael Sychak) came to fame as the frontman for the glam metal band Poison, which was formed in 1983 and had its greatest success in the late '80s and early-'90s.

The group has sold over 45 million albums to date and is best known for its number-one single Every Rose Has Its Thorn.

Michaels and Poison were set for a stadium tour as the opening for Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard with Joan Jett this summer, but the tour has been rescheduled for 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

In addition to multiple seasons of his VH1 reality series, Michaels is also known for winning season three of future President Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice.
