She has made no secret of her irritation over Melbourne's stage-four lockdown.

And on Tuesday, Rebecca Judd revealed the reality of her life during the pandemic by sharing a photo to Instagram of herself drinking wine while enjoying a DIY pampering session.

The 37-year-old footy WAG explained that wearing sheet masks and hanging on the couch was the current 'vibe' of this year.

'2020 vibes - mask and chill,' she captioned the post.

The mother of four was sporting a white bathrobe embossed with her initials as she relaxed on the couch with a glass of rosé and a face mask on. 

She paired the look with a headband and cat-eye sunglasses, and had pulled her brunette locks back into a bun.

'I'm a newly cold sore person and it's awful,' she confessed. 

Cold sores are blisters that form on the lips or surrounding skin and are caused by a virus known as herpes simplex (HSV).  

She didn't reveal how she caught the condition, but it's usually spread through direct physical contact such as kissing or sharing drinks with someone who has the virus.
