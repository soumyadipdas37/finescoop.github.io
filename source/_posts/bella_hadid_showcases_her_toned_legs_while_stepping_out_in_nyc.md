Bella Hadid is making a serious statement with her sense of style.

On Thursday, the supermodel was seen in New York City showing off her legs in a pair of tiny jean shorts, while also wearing a striking slogan long sleeved T-shirt.

Written across the shirt was 'ok hand over the cure and stop playing' which in the current climate could easily come across as a reference to the coronavirus pandemic. 

Meanwhile, Bella ignited rumors last week that she was once again getting close to her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd. 

Bella and The Weeknd originally split up in August 2019, and blamed conflicting schedules on the reason why their on/off relationship had once again come to an end.

According to an insider, at the VMA rehearsals, supermodel Bella was spotted at the NYC shoot location the same day that Grammy-award winning artist The Weeknd - real name Abel Tesfaye - wrapped up rehearsals for his upcoming performance. 

'They played it cool and crossed paths with each other, same place, same time,' an insider revealed to DailyMail.com, adding that the pair still appear to be 'on good terms.' 

The romance began between the pair after they first spotted at Coachella music festival together, back in April 2015. 

He later confirmed to Rolling Stone that he connected with Bella after he asked if she would appear on the artwork for his album Beauty Behind the Madness.
