Studio 10 hosts Sarah Harris and Tristan MacManus have responded to viewer criticism following a mixed reception to the show's new format. 

One popular criticism was that Tristan was wearing no socks with his black leather brogues on Monday morning's episode.  

'It was a bit of a bloodbath, we broke the internet, essentially. And the hottest topic of debate were your ankles,' Sarah said on Tuesday's episode. 

'It's fashion!' New Studio 10 host Tristan McManus responds to viewer criticism that he has 'smelly feet and shoes' from not wearing socks

'I went home, I took the washing machine apart, the dryer apart, got all those spare stocks out of it, stitched them all together and then forgot them this morning again!' Tristan replied, before revealing he failed to wear socks for a second day in a row. 

The hosts then went through 'brutal' online comments about Tristan's lack of socks. 

'Having Tristan onboard is great but can someone find him some socks,' Kathy Dolley wrote. 

Meanwhile, Gary Abel simply wrote: 'Smelly feet and shoes!' 

Backlash: Viewers left 'brutal' online comments after Tristan failed to wear socks during his debut episode on Monday 

'No I don't because I have those tiny little socklets, I believe they're called. It's fashion Gary!' Tristan replied. 

'Bruce Willis as well, from Gogglebox, you have no right to be telling me about wearing socks when you're wearing a singlet everyday with your back hairs popping out everywhere. Alright? Idris Elba sitting at home there, calm down fella!' 

Sarah then guessed he was talking about Gogglebox star Keith, which Tristan confirmed.

Tristan's side: The Studio 10 host explained he was wearing no-show socklets, which did not rise above his shoe 

She then pulled out a pair of socks for Tristan, saying: 'Will you just whack these on?' 

'I'll do it for Australia! Tristan said, before bizarrely putting the socks next to his ears and asking: 'Where do socks go?' 

'On your feet,' Sarah replied. 

Caving in: Co-host Sarah pulled out a pair of socks for Tristan to put on and he said he'd 'do it for Australia'
