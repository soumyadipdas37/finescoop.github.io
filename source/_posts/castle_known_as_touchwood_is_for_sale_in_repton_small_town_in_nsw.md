A stunning castle-like home has hit the market boasting incredible medieval features which take you back in time.

The castle, known as Touchwood, was built by history-obsessed Englishman in Repton, a small town in northern New South Wales.

The builder was a skilled stonemason and the unique property was handcrafted from stone, brick and local timbers over three years. 

Known as Touchwood, the castle is situated at 90 Tuckers Rock Road, Repton, a small town in New South Wales 

The home's kitchen and living room area are open plan with a handmade fireplace perfect for cooler days and nights

Sitting on a 6,000sqm block, the one-of-a-kind home contains three bedrooms in the main building, some connected by gangways.  

A beautiful kitchen and living room designed in an open plan with a fireplace ready to be lit during the cooler days and nights. 

There are also two bathrooms and two car spaces. 

Inside, the designer ensured Touchwood resembled homes back from the medieval times. 

With spiral staircases, glass stained windows and even suits of armour propped up inside the home giving it that castle feel. 

The current laundry was also previously used as a forge for sword making. 

Outside there is a huge verandah which boasts stunning views of the surrounding forest and ocean. 

Sitting on a massive 6000sqm, the one-of-a-kind home contains three bedrooms in the main building making it simply perfect for a couple ready to start a family 

The property has gained a lot of attention since it hit the market and is selling for $985,000

The backyard is private and big enough to plant flowers or fruits and vegetables, or a swimming pool. 

Separate to the main structure is a two-storey turret which can be used as a bedroom, home office, studio or Airbnb.

Selling agent Peter Stone said the property has gained a lot of attention since it hit the market.

'It gets a lot of intrigue but it will suit a very selective buyer,' Mr Stone told realestate.com.au.
