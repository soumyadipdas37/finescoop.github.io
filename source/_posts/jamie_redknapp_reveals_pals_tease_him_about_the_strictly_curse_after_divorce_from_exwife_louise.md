Jamie Redknapp has revealed his celebrity friends still tease him about the so-called Strictly curse, nearly three years after his divorce from his wife of 19 years, Louise.

The BBC series was blamed for the demise of his relationship with the singer, 45, as they split shortly after competing on the series with professional dancer Kevin Clifton in late 2016. 

'Of course, Freddie [Flintoff] and I get some stick but there's nobody who gives it and can't take it. I've never really felt uncomfortable with a joke', the former footballer, 47, said about the jokes made by his A League of Their Own co-stars in a new interview.

The sports pundit, who has barely spoken about his divorce publicly, insisted he's used to getting made fun out of as he added to Ireland's Sunday Independent: 'I've been in football dressing-rooms since I was 11 years of age and there was always a lot of slagging

'I was in the Liverpool dressing-room with Ray Houghton, John Barnes and Ronnie Whelan. If you can handle that, you can handle A League of Their Own.'

Competing on Strictly requires hard work and often draws competitors away from their families, creating rifts between loved ones. This phenomenon is known as the Strictly curse and has led to several divorces and breakups. 

A series of couples have fallen victim to the curse since the show's inception in 2004, including Natasha Kaplinsky, Ben Cohen, and more recently Neil and Katya Jones.

The show is also responsible for forming new romances, with lovebirds Giovanni Pernice and Ashley Roberts and Joe Sugg and Dianne Buswell embarking on romances following the 2018 series.  

Jamie shares sons Charles, 16, and Beau, 11, with the former Eternal singer, who has always denied claims that anything happened between her and Kevin in the past.

The father-of-two is currently dating Swedish model Frida Andersson-Lourie, according to reports.

A source told The Sun last month: 'Jamie feels ready to move on from his marriage to Louise and is happy to be doing it with someone who has kids too and is financially secure. 

'It's early days for Jamie and Frida, but they have grown close and are really enjoying spending time together when they can.' 

Frida is currently signed to Mrs Robinson Management, an agency for older models, and has previously appeared in content for designer brands such as Escada. 

She is a familiar face at high society parties and currently lives with her four children in a lavish mansion in West London after divorcing 58-year-old American hedge fund tycoon Jonathan Lourie.

Lourie appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2013 when he was estimated to be worth £80 million. 

The source added: 'He likes that she's also a parent so fully appreciates the balance, she is also keen on her fitness and loves spending time at home.' MailOnline contacted Jamie's representative for comment at the time.

Series 1: Natasha Kaplinsky and Brendan Cole

Did they/didn't they? Natasha Kaplinsky and her hunky partner Brendan Cole sparked affair rumours

Strictly hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons during season one. Viewers were transfixed by the apparent close bond between newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky and her hunky partner Brendan Cole. 

Although the pair went on to win the show, their success was blighted by affair rumours. 

BBC presenter Natasha soon split from long-term partner Mike Barnard while Brendan dumped his fiancée and fellow dancer Camilla Dallerup.

Writing in her book Strictly Inspirational, Camilla said their split was like a 'mini death'.

'You go through the arc of grief, anger, bitterness,' she said. 'My best friend and dancing professionally with Brendan had both gone.' 

However, Natasha has always denied any wrongdoing, saying: 'There was chemistry, of course, and I certainly fell in love with dancing, but I did not fall in love with Brendan.'

Series 5: Matt Di Angelo and Flavia Cacace

Of all the Strictly romances there's been over the years, this remains one of the most interesting.

Before long gossip was raging about how Flavia and Matt, then 19, were secretly in love. Shortly after the show finished she called time on her romance with Vincent and went public with Matt.

Looking back at their partnership, Matt told Daily Mail: ‘It was a pretty crazy time. It was front page news.

'The funny thing was the story did not start off as true, but the more you read it, the more you started to believe it and actually act on it.' 



Their romance ended in 2010, and a few weeks later Flavia admitted she was dating her latest dance partner, actor Jimi Mistry, who she went on to marry.

Kristina – who has also dated Vincent Simone and ex partner Joe Calzaghe – said there have been other couples, yet she is the only one to be 'attacked'.  

She said: 'Ben's said it many times and I'll say it again - I wasn't involved in the breaking up of his marriage.'

Meanwhile Abby described the split and resultant divorce as 'the most traumatic thing to ever happen to me'. 





Ben, 37, met Abby in 1995 at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before welcoming their daughters in 2008.

'On Strictly, you form a close bond with your partner, but there was nothing romantic when Pasha and I were dancing. It was just dancing,' she told the Mail the following January, insisting there's no such thing as The Curse.

'[Strictly] serves as a magnifying glass that shows up pre-existing fault lines,' she said, explaining the situation. She is still with Pasha today.

Divorced: Louise Redknapp appeared on the series in 2016, after which she and Jamie were said to be facing marital issues

Footballer Jamie Redknapp is said to have been offered a place on the Strictly line-up recently, but understandably has refused after the series was blamed for the demise of his marriage to wife Louise.

Louise appeared on the series in 2016, after which she and Jamie were said to be facing marital issues. By the end of 2017, they were divorced.

It was highly-speculated that Louise realised, during the show, that she wanted to get back to work having sacrificed her career for her marriage - with co-star Daisy Lowe said to have helped her 'rediscover her youth'.

A TV source said: 'Strictly used to be show that no celebrity ever turned down. But the Curse has changed all that. There is now a genuine concern that appearing on the show can negatively impact relationships. Jamie only has negative feelings about Strictly now. There’s absolutely no way he would appear.'

Louise was also rumoured to have struck up a romantic bond with her pro partner Kevin Clifton, but this has never been confirmed. 

Series 14: Kevin and Karen Clifton

Split: The Cliftons - a married pair of pro dancers - split romantically in 2018

Despite the rumours surrounding thrice-married Kevin while he partnered with Louise, nothing seemed to transpire between the two. He was, of course, married at the time too - to fellow pro Karen Clifton.

However, since then, the pair have split up.

Kevin proposed to her, on her birthday, on stage during a performance of Burn the Floor and they wed in July 2015. But in March 2018, they confirmed that they were no longer together romantically.

They have since continued to work together as a pro dance partnership, however, insisting there is no bad blood.
