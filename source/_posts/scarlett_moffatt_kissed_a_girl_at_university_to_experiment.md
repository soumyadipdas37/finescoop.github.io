Scarlett Moffatt has revealed she kissed one of her good girl pals while she was at  university to 'experiment'. 

In Wednesday's upcoming episode of ITV's Celebrity Karaoke Club, the Gogglebox star is quizzed by Courtney Act after singing along to Katy Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl. 

In a teaser clip, Courtney asks Scarlett, 30, who attended York University: 'What I want to know, when you sang I kissed a girl by Katy Perry, you said it reminded you of your university years.

She went on: 'Everyone says when you go to uni you need to experiment and all that stuff, so then I kissed one of my good friends actually.'
