They've recently been seen loving it up on a late summer trip to Palm Springs, California. 

And Dua Lipa along with boyfriend Anwar Hadid were back to their day-to-day on Thursday, when they were seen on a walk with their puppy Dexter in the West Hollywood area of Los Angeles.

The Levitating songstress, 25, wore a baggy ensemble consisting of a pink, white and blue-striped buttoned down men's shirt and light wash bootcut jeans.

The Westminster, London-born hitmaker had on a white tee which peeked out from underneath the bulky shirt, and she wore a nameplate necklace.

Dua also sported the same yellow-lens shades she flaunted on Instagram the day prior, in posts from her trip to the desert.

The former model carried a black leather pouch purse, and donned black shoes with shiny thick gold laces.

Lipa's brown locks were down with braids along the sides of her face, and she covered her mouth and nose in accordance with California law with a standard blue surgical face mask.

Last month, it was reported that Dua had moved from London to Los Angeles to be closer to beau Anwar, whom she's been dating since the middle of last year.

It was claimed the New Rules artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near Anwar's famous family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK.
