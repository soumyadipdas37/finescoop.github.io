Jennifer Garner wasted no time in responding to an Instagram comment claiming she's pregnant, insisting that she is not.

The 48-year-old actress shared a charming video from her family farm in Locust Grove, Oklahoma, when one fan decided to ask, 'Are you pregnant?' 

'I am 48, have three healthy kids, and am not -- and never will be --- pregnant,' the actress emphatically said.

'We can lay that pupper to rest. Have I gained the Covid 19? Possibly. But that is another story,' she added.
