Stella Maxwell cut a striking figure as she headed to coffee with a pal following their hike on Friday.

The Victoria's Secret model, 30, turned heads in a red tracksuit as she larked around with her friend following their walk at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. 

The beauty looked chilled as she strolled along with her pal and her dog before picking up a hot beverage at Blue Bottle Coffee.

Stella kept things casual for the outing, donning a loose-fitting red sweater and matching joggers. 

She added a pair of dark trainers to her relaxed look, while most of her face was hidden by trendy sunglasses and a black face mask.

The Belgian-born star, who had swept her blonde tresses into a high ponytail for the day, looked at ease as she made the most of the fine weather. 

Speaking to The Cut about her diet and exercise routine back in 2017, Stella confessed that she likes to mix up her work outs and also likes to sweat in the sun as much as possible.

'I do a bit of everything. It’s good for your body not to get too used to the same routine. I have a trainer I see regularly here in L.A. I also like to do a lot of outdoor exercise. 

'I think that’s a more special experience, especially if you can go with your friends — hiking, even going to the beach for the day and swimming, or maybe some surfing' the model said. 

Stella's preferred method of outdoor exercise has suited her well during quarantine. 

With many gyms being closed for months, some celebrities have found creative ways to safely meet with trainers in an isolated space or turn to the great outdoors for an easier approach to daily fitness. 

The model has been spending a lot of downtime in Los Angeles with her dog Trip, who she adopted with ex Kristen Stewart  in 2017 during the course of their on and off three year relationship. 

Meanwhile, along with her work as a Victoria's Secret Angel, the model is also known as a brand ambassador for the cosmetics brand Max Factor, which began with her first campaign in 2017.
