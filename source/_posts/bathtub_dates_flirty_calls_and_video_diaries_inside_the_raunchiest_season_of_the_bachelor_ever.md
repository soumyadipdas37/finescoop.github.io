Fans of The Bachelor Australia are bracing for some of the 'raunchiest' dates the franchise has ever seen during the upcoming isolation episodes.

Producers reportedly encouraged the women to do some 'very eyebrow-raising things' to keep the spark alive with Locky Gilbert, after the COVID-19 pandemic halted on-site production in March.

Locky enjoyed a series of steamy bathtub dates, flirty phone calls and video chats with the ladies, with a source telling Woman's Day: 'The crew had lots of lingerie available and encouraged the girls to wear it.'

Filming at the Bachelor mansion was suspended shortly after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global pandemic.

The dating show continued production via digital means, including Zoom dates, phone chats and virtual hangouts.

The impromptu new concept started well, with the source saying: 'There was a whole lot of raunchy phone chats, let's put it that way. The producers encouraged the girls to be as flirty and open as they could be.'

The women were urged to flirt with Locky, 31, on Zoom and through a series of video diaries they recorded for the former Australian Survivor star.

However, producers reportedly believed that they weren't being racy enough, and so encouraged them to resort to more extreme measures.

'Because the girls were separated from him, the producers were concerned he would lose interest and that the lack of physical connection could see him become disinterested,' the insider said. 

They then decided on a new idea: 'bathtub dates'.

It was during these bubbly Zoom chats that things supposedly took a daring turn - much to the satisfaction of producers.

In a separate interview with TV Week, contestant Roxi Kenny admitted that her feelings for adrenaline junkie Locky changed during lockdown.

The 29-year-old had returned to her native Queensland and found herself questioning her connection with the Bachelor.

'It definitely changed how I was feeling because it made me realise, "I just met this guy. Do I actually have those strong feelings or did I just get caught up in it all?'" she said. 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
