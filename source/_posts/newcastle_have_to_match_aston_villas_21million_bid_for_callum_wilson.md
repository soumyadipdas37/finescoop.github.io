Callum Wilson wants to join Newcastle United but they will have to at least match Aston Villa’s offer of £21million for the Bournemouth striker.

The Magpies made an offer totalling £20m on Saturday morning but Villa - who saw a £15m bid rejected on Friday - have returned with an improved package.

We understand Wilson’s preference is to move to St James’ Park. 

Newcastle must match Aston Villa's bid of £21million for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson 

Steve Bruce has identified Wilson as the man to bolster his attacking options this season

Wilson would be a huge acquisition for the Magpies after they were drubbed 5-1 by Middlesbrough in a pre-season game ahead of the 2020-21 campaign. 

The 28-year-old has been a standout performer since joining the Cherries in 2014 from Coventry, firing 67 goals in 187 appearances for the club.

Wilson's impressive displays in the Premier League have also seen him feature in Gareth Southgate's England squad, earning his first call up in November 2018 for games against the United States and Croatia. 

Meanwhile, Newcastle have offered around £13.5m for Norwich left-back Jamal Lewis and are in talks to sign former Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser on a free transfer.
