Justin Bieber and his wife Hailey Bieber continue to life their lockdown life in style.

The couple were seen enjoying their most recent vacation in Idaho this week, as Hailey, 23, showed off her impressive bikini body in a green two-piece. 

Meanwhile, pop star Justin, 26, displayed his vast display of body art as he went shirtless in a pair of teal blue swim shorts as they took to a beach area on Wednesday.

The famous pair - who were married on September 13 in 2018 - were in high spirits as they enjoyed their fun break with friends. 

At one point, it seemed as though the Baby singer was getting back to basics as held onto a bucket and spade while standing alongside his wife on the beach. 

The sighting comes after it was revealed that the pair have reportedly bought a huge $26 million new home in Los Angeles.

The superstar couple have been spending a lot of their time in quarantine at their other home in Ontario, Canada, and lockdown has not been keeping the dup from jet setting around.

But the pair recently got out of the city, boarding a private jet with wife over the weekend.

Justin and Hailey got down and dirty Monday, as they rode ATVs in the mountains with friends, while promoting his streetwear merch line Drew House in a series of snaps on Instagram.

The 26-year-old posted a photo to Instagram of himself standing next to Hailey, 23, who sat on an ATV, both of them covered in dirt.

It comes after Justin and Hailey recently caused some controversy when he broke social distancing guidelines to throw a party at his Beverly Hills mansion.  

They threw a huge bash last Sunday at their $8.5million abode, attended by celeb pals like Hudson, Jaden Smith, Winnie Harlow, Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

Guests were spotted gathering outside the 6,132-square-foot Monterey Colonial home, none of them wearing face masks. 

Meanwhile, it appears that their most recent trip away seems to be Northern Idaho, which is home to dozens of sandy beaches, including Huckleberry Bay and Reeder Bay.
