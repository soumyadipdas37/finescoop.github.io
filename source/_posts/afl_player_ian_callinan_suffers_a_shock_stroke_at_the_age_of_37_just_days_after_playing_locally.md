Former Adelaide Crows star Ian 'Wingnut' Callinan has been hospitalised after suffering a shock stroke at the age of 37. 

Callinan's wife Lauren and two sons Jack and Harry were 'absolutely shocked' when he had a stroke in Hobart, Tasmania last week.

The small forward played 32 AFL games for The Crows from 2011 to 2013 and now plays for the Old Hobartians Association Football Club 'The Ships' in his home state. 

Still an on-field presence, he booted four goals for The Ships just a week before he suffered the stroke.

The athlete also plays for Rokeby Cricket Club, which broke news of the stroke on Saturday.   

'Our thoughts and prayers are with our little home grown CHAMPION Ian Callinan, Lauren and immediate family,' the club wrote on Facebook. 

'It’s been a tough few days but if anyone can bounce back IT WILL BE our little master. From everyone involved/associated with The Bullets we are thinking of you guys with love.'  

The Southern Cricket Association provided an update on Callinan's health on Monday, saying he 'has suffered quite a setback in relation to his health'. 

'Last week Ian (Wingnut) suffered a stroke, which is something that has absolutely shocked the Callinan family and all of Ian’s friends, teammates and everyone else in Ian's life to the core,' the SCA wrote on Facebook. 

'Nut, is receiving the best of medical care and all steps are being taken to put treatment in motion that will allow this debilitating health setback to be addressed which will allow Ian to continue on with his life with minimal long term effects.'

Adelaide Football Club posted a picture of Callinan when he played in the AFL team, wishing him a speedy recovery in the caption. 

'Our thoughts are with our good mate Ian Callinan and his immediate family. Wishing you a speedy recovery, Nutsy,' the post read. 

Callinan's current football club, the OHA Ships, also showed its support for the much-loved player, calling him 'our little champion'.   

The 37-year-old played junior football in Tasmania before playing 109 games for the Tasmanian Devils Football Club in the Victorian Football League from 2001 to 2005.

Callinan won four premierships for Central District in the South Australian National Football League from 2007 to 2013. 

At 28 years old, he was a mature-age draftee when he was recruited to the Adelaide Crows to play in the AFL in 2011. 

The small forward and wingman was the league's smallest player during his career, standing at only 172 cm.

He scored 49 goals in 32 games across three seasons for The Crows before he was delisted at the end of 2013.
