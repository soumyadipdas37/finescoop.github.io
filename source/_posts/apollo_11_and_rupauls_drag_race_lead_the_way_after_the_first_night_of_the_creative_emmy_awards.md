The first night of the Creative Emmy Awards is in the books, with Apollo 11 and RuPaul's Drag Race getting off to big starts.

While the event typically takes place over two nights, the weekend before the Primetime Emmys telecast, this year's ceremony was split up into five separate nights.

Nicole Byer (Nailed It) hosts all five nights of the ceremony, filming pre-taped hosting segments due to the COVID-19 production restrictions.
