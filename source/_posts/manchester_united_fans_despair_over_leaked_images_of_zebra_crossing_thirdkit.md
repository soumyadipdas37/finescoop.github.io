Manchester United fans have mocked leaked images of their third-kit for the 2020-21 season.

The leaked pictures appear to show that a black and white striped design will be run across the entire strip - including shorts and socks.

Dubbed as the 'zebra design', fans of the club on social media have ridiculed the kit which also has a stencil-style club badge with red Adidas logo and iconic stripes over the shoulders.

Images have been leaked of Manchester United's third kit for the upcoming domestic season

Manchester United fans have ridiculed the leaked images comparing it to a 'zebra crossing'

The images show the third kit as striped from top to bottom on the shirt, shorts and socks

FootyHeadlines.com who leaked the images posted on their website: 'More pictures of the Manchester United 20-21 third kit have been leaked, revealing that the eye-catching pattern continues onto the shorts and socks.'

Twitter user MGTweetz said 'Strikers gotta look both ways before they cross your defence. Cus it do be looking like a zebra crossing.'

Ashwin Sapre replied: 'We got a zebra crossing kit cuz teams are gonna walk all over us'.



Many fans tweeted zebra related responses to the leaked images which would certainly make United stand out next season when they wear the kit.

PavleUtd tweeted: 'It looks like we're trying to hypnotise the opposition' while Kamil Kowalski added that the Red Devils will look 'stupid playing in pyjamas.' 

Ryan Wedderburn gave a brutal response to the kit saying that the kit 'has to be up there as one of the worst kits ever released.' 





The shirt retains US car giant Chevrolet as its principle sponsor, with the partnership due to run out in 2021, while American manufacturer Kohler again have sleeve sponsorship rights.

One of the things which stood out most to people in their response of the kit were the 'zebra' themed shorts. 

Twitter user Wassem said: 'I laughed for a good 15 minutes after looking at those shorts and realising how ridiculous players will look wearing. @adidasfootball y'all still have time cancel this abomination.'
