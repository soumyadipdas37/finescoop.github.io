Images have surfaced of a former Premier League star who has made quite a radical change in appearance since his high-flying days in the English topflight.

His long, un-groomed grey hair along with his Father Christmas-esque beard make him almost unrecognisable from his days playing for one of the Premier League's biggest teams.

The striker, who passes an incredible resemblance to Tom Hanks in the movie Castaway, has also featured for big clubs such as Atletico Madrid, PSV Eindhoven and Paris Saint-Germain before retiring at just 32 years old.

Former Chelsea striker Mateja Kezman looks completely different to his Stamford Bridge days as a striker under Jose Mourinho. 

After an impressive spell with Eredivisie side PSV, Kezman earned himself a £5.3million move to the Premier League with a Chelsea side beginning to build momentum. 

Despite only spending one season in London, Kezman scored seven goals in 40 appearances for the Blues, for who he wore the No 9 shirt.

The almost unidentifiable front man won a Premier League and a Football League Cup before swiftly moving on after just one season.

Kezman ventured off to Spain as he joined Atletico Madrid for the same fee as his arrival at Stamford Bridge.

His career started to enter a downwards spiral as injury hampered his season with the LaLiga side which caused plenty of frustration as he linked up well with Fernando Torres when they both fit to play.

The striker then moved on to Fenerbache where he spent three seasons in the Turkish divisions before spells with PSG, Zenit, BATE Borisov and South China saw his career come to an abrupt end at 32.
