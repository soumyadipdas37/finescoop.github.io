It was revealed earlier this week that her new man is 'playboy' Morad Izemrane, who was arrested for allegedly stealing a Rolex from a woman he had a tryst with.

And Arabella Chi and her latest love interest were pictured soaking up the rays while on holiday together in Marbella on Friday afternoon.

The Love Island star, 28, flaunted her toned and tanned figure in a skimpy black bikini, as she sunbathed poolside beside her new boyfriend.

The reality star wore her blonde locks swept up into a bun, while appearing to go make-up free as she showcased her naturally pretty features.

The couple were seen tucking into some snacks beside the pool and Arabella stayed hydrated by sipping on a large bottle of water.

Arabella was first spotted packing on the PDA with Izemrane, 35, in Ibiza toward the end of August, just weeks after going public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.

And, as well as unveiling Izemrane's identity, The Sun has also reported that he was arrested for stealing a pricey timepiece from a woman he had a tryst with in a toilet.

According to the publication, he was arrested on accusations of 'affectionate theft' against the Italian woman when attempting to fly from Ibiza to Palma the next day.

The case against Izemrane - who previously dated Dutch model Estelle Cruyff, 41, who is the ex-wife of former Chelsea ace Ruud Gullit and niece of late soccer legend Johann Cruyff.remains – remains as yet unresolved.

According to The Sun, the way Arabella and Izemrane met is just as astonishing, with a source saying: 'She was seeing a rich guy called Mark and they were out at a party when his friend Mojo turned up with a bottle of champagne.

'Later that evening she took off with Mojo in his Ferrari, leaving her boyfriend Mark behind. That’s how they met. It was pretty shocking. They’ve been together ever since. Arabella likes a good time and hasn’t looked back.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Arabella Chi for comment. 

Her new romance may come as a surprise to fans, as things appeared to be hotting up with Josh just a few weeks ago.  

Blonde beauty Arabella moved in with fellow Love Island alum Harley Brash, 21, in June following her split from Wes, 22.  

The pair had been dating for nine months but were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their break-up.

Design engineer Wes moved out of their home so they didn't have to isolate together under lockdown rules. 

The Dancing On Ice hunk is now living with pal and former Love Island star, Josh Denzel. 

The news likely came as a shock to their fans, as just a week before they called it quits, the pair revealed that they were enjoying their time in lockdown together.

Speaking to OK! Online, Wes said: 'It's been alright. It's hard to get out at the moment, isn't it? We're just trying to do our piece of exercise a day.

'We spend a lot of time with each other anyway so it's been okay to self-isolate because it's pretty much what we have been doing anyway, it's the same as before but we're just not getting out and about.

The exes had moved into their first flat together back in December, gushing that they were ready to start 'the next chapter' of their life.

In 2018, the Staffordshire native reached the final of Love Island with former exotic dancer Megan Barton-Hanson, before ending their relationship in January 2019.

Arabella appeared on the 2019 series of the ITV2 show and struck up a brief romance with Danny Williams, but was dumped from the island after just seven days.
