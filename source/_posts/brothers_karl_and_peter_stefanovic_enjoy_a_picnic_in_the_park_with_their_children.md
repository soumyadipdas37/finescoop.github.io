TV star brothers Karl and Peter Stefanovic welcomed children with their respective partners earlier this year.

And on Thursday, the doting dads enjoyed a day out in the park with their babies.

Karl, 46, beamed with joy alongside his four-month-old daughter, Harper May, as she rested on the picnic rug in a photo shared on Instagram.

He channelled in inner 'cool dad' with an all-black outfit comprising a T-shirt, jeans and well-worn Gucci sneakers.  

Next to the Today host was his younger brother Peter, 38, who hosts Sky News' First Edition breakfast show.

He appeared to take style cues from Karl, opting for a T-shirt with black jeans as he cuddled his seven-month-old son, Oscar. 

Peter also teamed his outfit with hi-top sneakers and wore his cap backwards.  

Bonding: Fans loved the sweet family photo, including one who commented: 'So nice to see the Stef Bros hanging out together.' Pictured: Peter with his son, Oscar, on another park outing

'Splendour on the grass,' Karl captioned his post.
