Brian Austin Green's former fling Tina Louise has added to her large collection of tattoos.  

The 39-year-old Instagram model is now the proud owner of another artistic piece on her sensational figure. 

On Monday, Tina went topless to debut a row of flowers on her underboob, along with a bee and crown on her stomach.

The busty bombshell finished: 'Yes it f**kin hurt. But it looks dope as f**k.'  

Social media star Tina made headlines after her highly-publicised on-again/off-again relationship with 90210 star Brian.  

Earlier this month, Tina, who boasts a whopping 2.4 million followers on Instagram, was forced to clap back at haters who complained she was showing too much skin on her Instagram feed. 

Oh my! Tina, who boasts a whopping 2.4 million followers on Instagram, was forced to clap back at haters who complained she was showing her body this month

During a Q&A, Tina was told to cover-up, and one troll even asked: 'Why do you need to show your body that much?'

Tina responded by sharing a video of herself in a racy swimsuit, which drew attention to her sensational curves and pert derrière.   

'Does it offend you that I'm confident and comfortable with my sexuality?' she wrote. 

Star: Tina has gone from Instagram star to bona fide celebrity since her fling with Brian made headlines in July. She was most recently spotted with the actor at the beach in LA this month

Tina was most recently spotted with Brian at the beach in Los Angeles in August.  

The father-of-four, who is separated from wife Megan Fox, was unable to take his eyes off the bombshell.

He had reportedly split with Tina at the end of July after a month of dating, only for them to reconcile weeks later.
