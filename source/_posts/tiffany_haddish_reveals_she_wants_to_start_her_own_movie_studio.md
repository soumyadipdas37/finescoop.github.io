Tiffany Haddish has plans for beyond her acting career, revealing in a new interview that she wants to start her own movie studio.

The 40-year-old actress revealed on TMZ Live on Monday, where she was asked by Charles Latibeaudiere if she would like to branch out with her own studio, like filmmaker Tyler Perry has.

The Girls Trip star excitedly said she wants to follow in Perry's footsteps, after it was revealed that Perry is now a billionaire thanks in no small part to his massive Atlanta studio, with Haddish revealing she even has a name for the studio all ready to go.

'Oh yeah. She Ready Studios,' Haddish exclaimed. 'I would love to do that. I talk to Tyler all the time. He's teaching me.

She added that she talks to people, 'who are doing the things that I want to do,' adding that just yesterday she, 'went on a hike with some billionaires.' 

'I'm just picking their brain while we're looking at big trees, about how do you build business, how do you build storefronts, 'cause I don't know. The best way to know is to talk to people who do know,' she added.

Haddish was also congratulated her Emmy nomination for her Netflix special Black-Mitzvah, in the Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) category.

The comedienne added that, 'if I win, I'll be the first African-American, Jewish female to win in that category.'  

When asked if she had prepared a speech, Haddish said that this year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nominees were required to record speeches and send them in.

'I had prepared one that I thought was perfect, and they told me I had to re-do it,' she said, and while she wouldn't say why they asked her to change it, fans may see it anyway.

'If I win, I'm gonna post it, and if I lose, I'm still gonna post it, cause I thought it was great,' Haddish said with a laugh. 

'Regardless if I win or lose, I'm gonna post the one that they rejected, because it was hilarious, it was poignant, and yeah,' she added. 

Perfect speech: 'I had prepared one that I thought was perfect, and they told me I had to re-do it,' she said, and while she wouldn't say why they asked her to change it, fans may see it anyway

Haddish has also been working with comedian Dave Chappelle for his Camp Covid shows he's doing in Ohio, with the actress revealing, 'It's so much fun.'

'First of all, I've never felt more safe anywhere in my life,' Haddish began. 'As soon as you get off the airplane you get tested immediately, you're always wearing your mask, and I love it.'

She added that she can take the mask off on stage, adding the audience is 'all spaced out' in a 'huge field,' joking that they're growing 'Christmas trees on one side and corn on the other.'
