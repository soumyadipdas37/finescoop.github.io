Josh Taylor, having fretted through his 11-month absence from the ring, needed only 161 seconds to reassert his domination over world super-lightweight boxing.

The Tartan Tornado he surely is, this exceptional fighter from Prestonpans.

Apinun Khongsong, the Thai challenger for Taylor's two unified world titles, crumpled into a heap the first time he was hit to his slender body in a venue fabled for extraordinary happenings.

Josh Taylor knocked out Apinun Khongsong in an incredible first round on Saturday night

The Scot threw a devastating left-hand body shot to send his opponent down in 161 seconds

This night will rank among the more bewildering in the storied history of East London's York Hall.

Khongsong spent five times longer writhing on the canvas than the two minutes and 41 seconds it took Taylor to plant that devastating left beneath his ribs.

Even after all that medical attention Taylor's victim had to be wheeled out of the echoing, Covid secure emptiness of the arena on a stretcher.

While he waited, Taylor took a quiet, courteous bow.

Taylor moves closer to a world unification fight with WBO and WBC champion Jose Ramirez

Khonsong is unusually tall for this division and that gangly frame had been reputed to give him the leverage for all the knock outs on his record.

But that frame proved to be a fatal flaw. He was not possessed of the shock absorbers to withstand even one of Taylor's precision power punches.

Taylor could have done with a few rounds but will still head on to even greater things next year. Hopefully with his tartan army in attendance.

Jose Ramirez, his rival world champion, has been warned.
