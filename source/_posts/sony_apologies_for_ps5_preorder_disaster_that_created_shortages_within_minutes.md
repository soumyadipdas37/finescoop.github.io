Sony issued an apology on Twitter for PlayStation 5 pre-orders turning into a disaster.

The Japanese company announced pricing and release dates for the gaming system Wednesday and minutes after the event, nearly every major retailer was 'out of stock.'

Retailers including Amazon, GameStop and Walmart jumped the gun with opening pre-orders a day early that started a buying frenzy in the gaming community. 

Gamers around the world ran to their computers, smartphones and tablets to reserve a console, but many were met with broken links, page time outs and the dreaded 'out of stock' message.

Sony shared in the tweet that it is set to release more consoles over the next few days and promises 'more PS5s will be available through the end of the year.'

Sony issued an apology on Twitter for PlayStation 5 pre-orders turning into a disaster. Sony shared in the tweet that it is set to release more consoles over the next few days and promises 'more PS5s will be available through the end of the year'

PlayStation 5 pre-orders were not set to open until Thursday, September 17, as the gaming system shared a tweet shortly after the event: 'PS5 pre-orders will be available starting as early as tomorrow at select retailers.'

However, many retailers seemed to jump the gun and offer the gaming console earlier- even without having any physical systems. 

GameStop shared a news release stating it was now taking pre-orders for the PS5 Wednesday evening and quickly ran out of stock.

Target also sold out and is encouraging consumers to check back on the official release date of November 12.

Pre-orders were gone in what seemed to be minutes on Amazon, leaving many customers with an error message or telling them they missed getting the console in the first release. 

Amazon has also warned users who were able to secure a PS5 that they may not receive the console by the official release date of November 12.

'We're contacting you about your order of PlayStation 5 to let you know in advance that you may not receive this item on the day it is released due to high demand,' the email reads. 

'We'll make every effort to get the item to you as soon as possible once released.'

Users also ran to Twitter last week when they could not secure a console, telling the world of their frustrations.

Jason Celso was also unable to secure the gaming console, but is hopeful to have better luck pre-ordering the Xbox Series X

However, it seems those who beat the rush and pre-ordered a PS5 are already trying to 'flip them on Amazon and Ebay' for a higher cost
