Meanwhile, last week the star begged fans to listen to Boris Johnson after the Prime Minister's latest address to the nation.

The Diva Forever star took to Instagram following his TV appearance to issue an important message to her followers of how they should stick to the tougher restrictions.

Boris has imposed a set of new restrictions, including a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants, indoor sports subject to the rule of six, and people working from home where possible- all of which could last for six months.

Talking to PlayOJO bingo, Gemma said last week: 'It's really encouraging to see Boris taking action to tackle the issue of obesity in our country.

'Boris has lost some weight himself recently – I saw him on the news the other day with his weight loss and his holiday tan and I thought "Boris looks a bit of a sort".

'Bless you Boris – losing weight will make anyone feel better.'

The Prime Minister, 56, has lost at least a stone in weight and has enlisted the help of a personal trainer after recovering from coronavirus.
