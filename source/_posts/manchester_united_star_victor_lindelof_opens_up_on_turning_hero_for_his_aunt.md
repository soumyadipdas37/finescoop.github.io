Victor Lindelof has opened up on dishing out his own piece of civil justice by chasing down the man who stole his aunt's purse.

The Manchester United defender was back in his native Sweden at the end of last month when 90-year-old Kerstin had her bag snatched by a passing cyclist.

Lindelof, who was out in the city of Vasteras at the time, saw the incident and chased down the thief, catching him and holding him before police arrived.

'Everything went very fast,' he told Swedish publication Sport Bladet. 

'I did not think much. I just wanted to help my aunt get her bag back and what she had in it. It was nothing more than that, I just wanted to help.'

The 26-year-old's actions have not gone unnoticed, and his national team boss has also praised his actions. 

Speaking ahead of Sweden's Nations League ties, Janne Andersson told reporters: 'It is downright evil to rob 90-year-old ladies, but if that happens now, it is good that there are guys like Victor with civil courage, high morals and a lot of emotions,.

'Victor is a sensitive guy so when he sees this I understand that he reacts as he did. Fantastically well done.

'I have not talked to him, but I will pat him as much as you can in these times when we meet on Monday. More such civil courage in more people would be good for society.'
