Homeowners are today expected to start scrambling to grab a share of the government cash available for green home improvements.

The Green Homes Grant scheme offers up to £5,000 towards energy efficiency improvements that could cut bills by up to £600 a year.

The scheme, which opens for applications today, provides a voucher that covers two thirds of qualifying work to your home.

This could include insulation or installing low-carbon heating. The maximum value of the voucher is £5,000, or £10,000 if you are on a low- income and receive certain benefits.

You must own your own home in England or be a landlord — although landlords can only receive up to £5,000.

You must redeem the voucher and ensure improvements are completed by March 31.
