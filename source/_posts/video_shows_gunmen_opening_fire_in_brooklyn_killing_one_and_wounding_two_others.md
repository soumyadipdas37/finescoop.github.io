The New York City Police Department has released new surveillance video showing the moment two gunmen approached a housing complex in Brooklyn and opened fire, killing one person and injuring two others. 

The shooting took place at around 1.40am on Thursday near the Van Dyke Houses on Blake Avenue in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.

Video released by the police on Friday shows at least three suspects walking towards the housing complex. 

The NYPD has released video showing gunmen walking up to the Van Dyke Houses in Brownsville early Thursday with guns drawn 

The man in the front dressed in all black points his gun toward a group of people off camera and opens fire 

Two other suspects can be seen behind the man in black, at least one of them shooting 

The one in the front, dressed in a black hooded sweatshirt, looks around then raises his gun and opens fire. 

His apparent accomplices walking behind him follow suit, firing multiple shots before running away. 

The youngest of three victims, identified as 22-year-old Joshua Santiago, was shot in the left eye and later died from his injury at a nearby hospital, reported the New York Post. 

Evidence markers are seen scattered outside the housing project following the shooting 

A white gym shoe is seen resting next to a Yankees baseball cap at the scene  

A 32-year-old man suffered a gunshot wound to his right arm and a 38-year-old woman was shot in her left leg. Both were listed in stable condition at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center.

Investigators are looking for multiple suspects who may have fled the scene in two separate vehicles - a black BMW and a white Ford Fusion. 

According to reports, at least 14 people were shot, two fatally, in New York City between Tuesday and early Wednesday, CBS New York reported. 

The shooting left 22-year-old Joshua Santiago dead, and a man and a woman wounded 

The suspects fled the scene in two vehicles, possibly including this black DMW

Police are looking for this Ford Fusion in connection to the triple shooting 

The most recent data indicate that the number of people shot is up more than 97 per cent compared to the same time last year. 

'You want to reduce shootings, take gun arrests seriously. We’ve put so much work into that over the last six years,' NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said Wednesday. 'There’s always an exception. But there is no reason to carry an illegal firearm on the streets of New York City.'

Anyone with information can call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at (800) 577-TIPS. Calls are confidential.
