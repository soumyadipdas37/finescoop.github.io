A sobbing toddler, thought to be about two years old, was found wandering alone in the streets of Hull.

The little boy was spotted looking lost and confused by two passers-by on a road in Spring Bank in Hull, East Yorkshire on Saturday afternoon.

The men phoned the police who were filmed arriving on the scene in a Facebook video that has been viewed almost 20,000 times.  

Passers-by called the police when they found a little boy all alone looking lost and confused on a road in Spring Bank in Hull, East Yorkshire on Saturday afternoon

Footage shows the missing boy, who is wearing a red coat and green shorts, waiting with two men and a child as the police arrive.

The men explain the situation while the little boy stands beside the adults with a terrified look on his face. 

One policeman tries to talk to the boy, saying: 'Hello love. You alright? It's okay, talk to us.' 

The other policeman bends down to the boy's height and reaches for his hand, coaxing him to come to him, saying: 'We'll find mummy, come on.' 

Video footage shows the police arriving on the scene as one policeman tries to talk to the boy, bending down to his level saying: 'We'll find mummy, come on'

The terrified boy continues to sob as he is held in the policeman's arms as the men try to figure out his name and where he lives

He picks the toddler up in his arms as the little boys begins to sob.

'Where's your house?' he asks him. 'Where's mummy?', but the boy just continues to cry.

The four men discuss the situation, with the policemen wondering why they can't see any distressed parents out looking for him.

When the boy calms down they ask him again where he lives and his name but he only shakes his head. 

Eventually, the two police officers take the boy to their police van and it has been confirmed that the little boy has been safely reunited with his family

Eventually, the two police officers take the boy to their police van promising the boy some chocolate and thanking the kind strangers for looking after him. 

Humberside Police confirmed to The Sun that the boy has now been safely returned to his family.

It is unclear how the toddler ended up wandering the street by himself.

People commenting on the video expressed their relief that the boy had been found by the right people with one person writing: 'Thank goodness you helped him it could have been so much worse.'

Another wrote: 'Ah bless him. His parents will be frantic. Glad it was someone nice who spotted him before he was in any danger. Hope he’s home and safe.'
