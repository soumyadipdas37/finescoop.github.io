Eddie Hearn believes Anthony Joshua is primed to demolish Kubrat Pulev and Tyson Fury in his next two fights by knocking both of his rivals out.

Joshua, who currently holds the IBF, IBO, WBA, WBO heavyweight titles, is set to face Pulev in a mandatory defence of his belts later this year, with a fight on December 12 pencilled in.

And despite his return to the ring being delayed by months because of the Covid-19 pandemic, promoter Hearn insists his man is ready to establish himself as the division's unified champion in style.

Tyson Fury is next up for Joshua after Pulev - but Eddie Hearn believes he'll get knocked out

'I actually messaged him and I said: "You're going to steamroll through these guys," Hearn told Sky Sports.

'He just replied in capitals and said: "STEAMROLL!" I think he'd love to [stop Fury]. Yeah. He knows that Fury is an outstanding fighter and it's going to be very difficult. 

'But you can ask him for yourself, I believe he has bad intentions in those fights and I believe he expects to. I believe he will knock out Kubrat Pulev and Tyson Fury.'

Joshua is scheduled to take on Fury in two mega-fights in 2021 after the financial terms of the deal were agreed earlier this year.

And with the Gypsy King holding the WBC title - the one belt which has so far eluded AJ during his career - Hearn expects to see an even more aggressive performance from the 30-year-old.  

'I think he's ready to start doing a demolition job on these guys,' Hearn added. 

'I think he's shown, coming back from the [Andy] Ruiz Jr fight, that he has the ability to box and move. That's in the arsenal now. 

'But he still loves knocking people out - and when you see the drills, when you see the pads and you see that spite in his shots.'
