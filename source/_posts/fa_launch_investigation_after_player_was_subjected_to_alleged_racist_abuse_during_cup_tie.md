The FA have launched an investigation after a player was allegedly subjected to racist abuse from the crowd, leading to an FA Cup tie being abandoned.

Combined Counties Premier Division side CB Hounslow United took a stand and refused to come out of their dressing room for the second half of the preliminary round tie at Sevenoaks Town after a member of their team was targeted.

Sportsmail understands complaints were made to the referee on four separate occasions during the first half by the player on the receiving end of the abuse.

And the shocking incidents prompted Hounslow United to take matters into their own hands as they decided not to continue the game. An FA spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of the allegations and we are currently investigating the matter.’

Sevenoaks said in a post on Twitter following the match: ‘Today’s game has been abandoned. We are investigating an alleged matter and no further comment will be made until this process has been concluded.’

Sevenoaks confirmed they had been gathering witness statements as part of the probe.

Hounslow have been asked for their observations by the FA, who are awaiting the referee’s report as part of their investigation.

Isthmian League South East side Sevenoaks were 3-0 up at the break after goals from Kyle De Silva, Tyrell Richardson-Brown and James Bessey-Sakdana before the game was halted. No complaint had been made to Kent Police by Sunday night.

Last season an FA Cup qualifying match between non-League Haringey Borough and Yeovil was called off after racist abuse was aimed at players by the crowd.

Haringey’s players walked off after defender Coby Rowe suffered racist abuse, while goalkeeper Douglas Pajetat was spat at and had objects thrown at him, with Yeovil agreeing not to finish the match in a display of solidarity.

The incident led to five men being arrested.
