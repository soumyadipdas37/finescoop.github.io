A psychotic serial killer due for release from jail on Thursday is being invetsigated over alleged threats to bomb a police station and kill one of his victim's family members.

Reginald 'Tex' Arthurell is set to be walk free from prison this week by the New South Wales Parole Authority after being denied parole four times.

The 75-year-old has admitted killing three people, including two after being released from jail for previous crimes and is a major suspect in several other murders.

The former rodeo worker known as 'The Cowboy' bashed his fiance Venet Mulhall to death with a piece of wood in their home in Coonabarabran in 1995.

He is accused of threatening Ms Mulhall's family on his impending release.

The Daily Telegraph reported Arthurell told a fellow prisoner of destructive plans after his jail sentence, which has left Ms Mulhall's family in fear.

The killer allegedly also plans to blow up the NSW Police headquarters. 

NSW police are looking into the claims to finalise their investigation before Arthurell's release. 

'Officers from the Orana Mid-Western Police district have received a report of threats allegedly made by a 75-year-old man and are currently investigating the matter,' a spokesperson said.

The SPA are also awaiting an aged care assessment before Arthurell's release.

Arthurell was photographed wearing one of Ms Mulhall's dresses after her brutal murder and now calls himself 'Ms Arthurell' despite residing in a male prison.

The couple became pen pals when Arthurell was in Darwin Prison and moved in together when he was released on parole in 1991.

Ms Mulhall's brother Paul Quinn found her body after Arthurell's vicious attack and wrote a book titled 'In the Hands of Evil' about his sister's life and death.

'As I climbed through the window, I knew from the foul smell, that I was entering a horrendous situation, and that I was looking for a decomposing body,' Mr Quinn wrote.

'As the edge of the door passed through my gaze, I could see what I at first thought was a black plastic garbage bag, propped up against the door jam.'

Mr Quinn told A Current Affair Arthurell was a danger to the community.

'He was born a psychopath and he'll be a psychopath all his life,' he said.

'He'll never change. He has no remorse, no conscience, he doesn't have any compassion for anyone.' 

Arthurell previously killed his stepfather Thomas Thornton in Sydney in 1974 and naval officer Ross Browning in the Northern Territory in 1981.
