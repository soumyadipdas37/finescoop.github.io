Theo Hayez's family have shared a touching post to mark the Belgium backpacker's 20th birthday after he vanished in Byron Bay more than a year ago. 

Theo was 18 years old when he was last seen leaving the Cheeky Monkey's nightclub in the New South Wales tourist town at 11pm on May 31, 2019.

Despite launching a desperate search for the backpacker, Theo's family have been left without answers over his disappearance.  

Theo's parents Vinciane Delforge and Laurent Hayez said the pain of reaching another milestone without their son was 'indescribable' but vowed to continue their search.

'We will never stop looking for our boy and searching for answers,' they said in a statement reported by the ABC.

Theo's godfather Jean-Philippe Pector also paid tribute to the missing traveller on his birthday.

Mr Pector hosted the then-teenager at his 22-acre property in Victoria's Otways for about a month after he landed in Melbourne in November 2018. 

'Today Theo you should be 20. I wish I could say ′′Happy Birthday',' Mr Pector wrote on Facebook.

'It should be a day full of joy, as it has always been since you were born. But now, since you're not here and we don't know what happened to you, it's very difficult to celebrate this day.'

Mr Pector said it was a special day but 'not so happy'.

'We miss you so much,' he continued.

'Today, Theo, we won't be able to share good times with you, talk to you, hug you and make your wonderful smile shine. 

'But we will nevertheless continue to celebrate you, remembering all the good, unique moments we shared together. 

'You will never leave our hearts, you will always live in us.'

Mr Pector included a series of images with his birthday message, including a picture of him wearing a 'missing persons' t-shirt and 'Theo' built out of Lego.

Theo never returned to the hostel where he was staying and it was not until June 6 - a week after he was last seen - that his family in Europe raised the alarm.  

His father Laurent flew out to Australia to join other family members, police and local volunteers in the search for his son.

'When I left Belgium I promised Hayez's little brother, Lucas, I would bring his brother home, please help me keep my promise to him', Laurent said on his arrival.  

A grey Puma hat similar to the one Theo was wearing when he vanished was found in bushland last July. 

Extensive land, air and sea searches failed to find a trace of the teenager and the NSW Police referred Theo's case to the Coroner a year ago. 

May 31st 7.45pm: Theo Hayez and an unnamed friend were caught on CCTV camera at a local bottle shop in Byron Bay.

June 16th: Theo's mother Vinciane Delforge, told a French broadcaster in Belgium she is holding out hope her son is safe and well, but said his disappearance is entirely out of character.

June 17th: Theo's father Laurent Hayez travels to Byron Bay to help search for his son Theo. He makes an emotional plea asking Australia to keep looking for his son and vows to stay in the country until he is found.

He says he hopes WhatsApp will cooperate with police to decode the messages that Theo last sent - a feat, he says, which could change the course of the search.
