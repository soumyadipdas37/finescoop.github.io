The Premier League has issued a statement expressing its disappointment with the Government's decision to not allow fans to attend games from October.

England's top flight had previously intended for some supporters to return to stadiums from next month, but those plans have now been cancelled following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on Tuesday. 

The Premier League is adamant that, if fans were to attend, they would do so in a safe environment, as has been shown in other countries such as Germany, where some supporters have been permitted to attend Bundesliga matches. The league say that it would be 'safe or safer' for fans to go to football matches than to go to shops, pubs and restaurants. 

The Premier League has criticised the Government's decision to delay the return of fans

The Premier League's statement read: 'The Premier League is certain that, through League-wide guidelines and a code of conduct developed with scientific experts and agreed by the Government’s Sports Ground Safety Authority, fans in stadiums will be as safe or even safer than at any other public activity currently permitted. This is already evident in other European leagues.

'The Premier League notes the Government’s announcement today and while the health of the nation must remain everyone’s priority, we are disappointed that the safe return of supporters to matches has been postponed.

'The Premier League is certain that, through League-wide guidelines and a code of conduct developed with scientific experts and agreed by the Government’s Sports Ground Safety Authority, fans in stadiums will be as safe or even safer than at any other public activity currently permitted. This is already evident in other European leagues.'

The Premier League emphasised the financial impact of continuing to play games without fans

The Premier League emphasised the financial repercussions of fans not being allowed to attend games, with clubs and local communities suffering. 

'Football is not the same without attending fans and the football economy is unsustainable without them. Last season, Premier League clubs suffered £700m in losses and at present, our national game is losing more than £100m per month. This is starting to have a devastating impact on clubs and their communities.'

The league added that they will continue to liaise with the Government over a possible return for fans to stadiums, and stressed that they are continuing to work to ensure that stadiums are as safe as possible. 

They added that they are prepared to use 'innovative ways' to get supporters back into grounds safely.  

The Premier League will continue to liaise with the Government over the return of fans

'We are confident that Premier League clubs, using innovative ways to get supporters safely back into grounds, will enable revenues to return to all levels of the game, as well as maintain solidarity arrangements, current tax contributions and financial support for local and national economies.

'While there is a current pause in a date for fans returning to sports venues, the Premier League and our clubs will not slow down in our preparations for providing safe, bio-secure environments. We will continue to work with Government to bring supporters safely back into grounds as soon as possible.'
