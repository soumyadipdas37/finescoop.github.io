Massive changes are on the way for weddings, schools and community sport in New South Wales as the state takes another step in easing strict COVID-19 rules.

Dancing at weddings will be allowed from Friday, however, the dancefloor will be limited to just 20 people in the bridal parties. Previously, only the bride and groom were allowed to dance. 

Interschool activities will resume on Saturday - again under COVID-safe rules - and more than one parent will be allowed to watch from the sidelines while practising social distancing. No carpooling is allowed.

School choirs, musical ensembles, camps and excursions will resume in Term 4, as will school sports.

Year 6 formals and graduations are back on and high school formals will be permitted after the HSC, while kindergarten orientation and Year 7 transitions will be allowed under COVID-safe rules.

Under the changes, entertainment facilities can increase capacity to 50 per cent and function centres hosting corporate meetings will be allowed to cater for up to 300 people, up from 150, from next week.

'For workers across the full spectrum of the performing arts - from box office staff to ushers, from technicians and roadies to the artists - this change means more jobs,' Minister for the Arts Don Harwin said on Friday.

'For audiences, it means we can soon enjoy the experiences we have all missed so much during the pandemic.'

Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres said the relaxation of restrictions on corporate events will boost business for function centres.

'It's vitally important for the business community to back on its feet by being able to collaborate and share ideas in person once again,' he said in a statement.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday dangled the prospect of New Year's Eve fireworks being held on Sydney Harbour this year to 'offer people a glimmer of hope'.

The New South Wales premier said the state government will offer to pay for Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks to make sure they go ahead

Gladys Berejiklian said the fireworks represent 2021 being a sign of home amid the coronavirus pandemic

But mass gatherings on the harbour foreshore won't be allowed.

The changes come after the state recorded no new cases of community-spread COVID-19 for the third day in a row. 

There was just one case recorded in a returned traveller in hotel quarantine. 

NSW Health is treating 71 cases, with two patients in intensive care. None are on ventilators and the majority are in non-acute, out-of-hospital care.

There were 17,392 coronavirus tests conducted in the past 24-hour reporting period, compared with 16,759 in the previous 24.
