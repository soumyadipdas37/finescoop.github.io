Real Housewives of Melbourne star Chyka Keebaugh's daughter Chessie isn't afraid to flaunt her figure on social media. 

And last month, the 26-year-old showed off her ample assets in a series of racy pictures on Instagram.  

The plus-size model explained that her parents would be 'proud' that she feels 'sexy in her body'.

'I debated posting these BOMB *** pics I took on the weekend, because you all love to dm [direct message] me saying "WhAt Do YoUr PaReNts ThiNk",' she captioned the photos. 

'I would hope they are proud they raised a women who came out the other side of her insecurities and can feel sexy in her body.. I don’t know though, maybe that’s just me?' 

In the series of black and white snaps, Chessie flaunted her curvy physique in an unbuttoned white shirt which she paired with a lacy bra.

Flaunt it: The racy post isn't unusual for Chessie, who has reinvented herself as a plus-size model and influencer since viewers last saw her on the third season of The Real Housewives of Melbourne

The racy post isn't unusual for Chessie, who has reinvented herself as a plus-size model and influencer since viewers last saw her make an appearance on the third season of The Real Housewives of Melbourne. 

The brunette bombshell regularly flaunts her curves in lingerie and scanty ensembles on social media.  

The young socialite is based in New York City, where she works as a producer for a creative agency. 

In 2016, she was signed to Giant Model Management as a 'curve model'.
