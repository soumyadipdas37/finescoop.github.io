Brad Pitt's legal team reportedly plan on calling on Angelina Jolie's Girl, Interrupted costar Jillian Armenante to testify at the former power couple's upcoming custody trial. 

A witness list for Pitt filed on September 21 includes a therapist, security guard, and numerous psychologists, according to Us Weekly.     

Pitt will also be testifying, and will have Jolie cross-examined by his attorneys, claims the site.

The trial is set to occur from October 5 to October 23, according to Us Weekly. 

DailyMail.com have contacted representatives for Pitt. 

Jolie starred opposite Armenante and Winona Ryder in the 1999 film Girl, Interrupted, which followed a troubled young woman at a psychiatric hospital. 

Jolie also worked with Armenante in the 2007 film A Mighty Heart.

The former power couple have been locked in a bitter custody battle ever since splitting in 2016. 

Relations between the former couple who share six children have deteriorated to the point where they are no longer engaging in family therapy ahead of a custody trial slated for next month, UsWeekly reported earlier this month.

'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place,' a source exclusively told the website.

Pitt and Jolie had appeared to reach a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted leaving the actress' LA home in June after spending time with the children.

However, UsWeekly claimed they have become at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.

Eldest child Maddox, 19, is allowed to choose his own timetable and is rumored to no longer have any contact with his father.

'Brad wants 50/50 joint physical and legal custody of the kids. Angelina has been unagreeable to those terms,' a source told UsWeekly.

The insider added that Jolie 'will only agree to talk about an agreement if the home base for the children isn't Los Angeles. The younger kids are in school in Los Angeles, which Angelina has always been opposed to.'

It's previously been suggested that Jolie wants to relocate to the UK and base the children with her there.

Pitt and Jolie - who enjoyed the moniker Brangelina during their time together - separated in September 2016 when the Maleficent star filed for divorce following an incident aboard a private jet involving son Maddox and Pitt.

The two had met on the set of the film Mr. & Mrs. Smith that was released in June 2005.

Several months before the movie's debut, Pitt and then wife Jennifer Aniston had announced they were separating after five years of marriage, with the Friends star subsequently filing for divorce in March 2005.

On January 11, 2006, Jolie finally confirmed the romance with Pitt when she confirmed she was pregnant with his child.
