The 90 Day Fiancé franchise is finally coming to Australia.

At the Channel Nine Upfronts on Wednesday, the network announced that they would be releasing 'fast-tracked episodes' of the show exclusively on the 9Now streaming service.

The first four seasons of the main show are already available on 9Now, but more are on the way.

From October 1st, 9Now will have season five of the original flagship show, along with the first seasons of Before the 90 Days and Happily Ever After.  

90 Day Fiancé is currently one of the most popular reality TV franchises in the world.

It's one of the highest rated franchises in America, allowing its network TLC to surpass Bravo (home of The Real Housewives franchise) in ratings and key demos.

Since its launching in 2014, its spawned no less than ten spin-offs, with more to come next year.

The show follows couples from different countries and cultures, one American and one foreigner, in long-distance relationships. 

It's already featured one Australian participant in Erika Owens, who also made history as one half of the first ever same-sex couple to be featured on the show.

Erika and her internet girlfriend Stephanie Matto starred on season five of Before the 90 Days earlier this year.

During their season, Stephanie left America to stay with Erika in Port Augusta to see if their online romance could work in the real world. 

Unfortunately, the couple split shortly after filming and have since gone on to find success as influencers and OnlyFans models.
