A tiny but fiery female construction worker leapt to the defence of her fiance during a late night assault outside a popular kebab shop. 

Nicole Hendrie, 27, appeared in Waverley Local Court on Tuesday, where she entered an early guilty plea to one charge of common assault.

The court heard a verbal argument between her fiance Lewis Daley and a man escalated into a physical altercation outside the Big Bite in beachside Bondi in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

According to court documents, the victim and his friends believed Daley and his fiancee were staring at them and began looking in their direction before Hendrie swore and shouted at the group, the Wentworth Courier reported.

'The co-accused (Daley) grabbed hold of the victim's neck where a physical altercation occurred,' the police facts read.

'During the altercation the co-accused (Daley) was knocked to the ground. The co-accused landed on his head with great impact.'

Her lawyer Andrew Sant told the court his client only intervened to protect her towering fiance after Daley was injured when he was knocked to the ground and hit his head.

 Hendrie grabbed the other man's shirt and push and slapped him 'using open palms', court documents stated.

Mr Sant told the court Hendrie was 'truly mortified' by her 'foolish behaviour' and now realises her conduct was unacceptable.

The assistant contract administrator at Samsung C and T spent the night in a police cell following her arrest.

Her fiance was also arrested and charged. 

'You say it's an embarrassment, the situation, and I imagine it would be,' Magistrate Jacqueline Trad told Hendrie on Tuesday. 

The magistrate noted Hendrie's otherwise clean record and sentenced her to a two year conditional release order.

No conviction was recorded against Hendrie.

She relocated to Sydney from the UK six years ago and was due to marry her fiance on June 20 before the wedding was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Daley will appear in court later this month on September 29.
