The Wonder Years star Danica McKellar talked of her excitement for the upcoming reboot of the much-loved show.

The 45-year-old actress was spotted in Los Angeles on Thursday as she picked up a coffee and stopped to chat about the re-imagining of the series which will now center on a middle-class black family in Montgomery, Alabama in the late 1960s. 

Danica admitted she has not been asked to be a part of the new show but revealed her former costar Fred Savage emailed her to tell her about it before the news broke.

'I'm not involved at all but it sounds fascinating. A lot of great people are involved.' the actress, who played Winnie Cooper, said.

'They're gonna make something really quality and I'm really excited to see how they will manage to somehow honor the legacy of the show while bringing something completely new to it as well.'

Danica explained that it would be impossible for her to make a cameo as it's set in 1968 and Kevin and Winnie would have been 12 at the time. 

But she added that she'd love to be involved, 'I'm always open to being a part of great projects.'

The original Wonder Years was set between 1968 and 1973 and starred Fred as Kevin Arnold, an adolescent boy growing up in a suburban middle-class family. 

The series ran from 1988 to 1993. 

The reboot is being executive produced by Lee Daniels (Empire, Precious) and Savage is also involved.

Danica and Fred have remained close since the show ended in the 1990s and the duo delighted fans as they reunited in February 2019 along with their other costar Josh Saviano. 

Sharing a selfie of the trio to Instagram, Danica wrote: 'This group look familiar to anyone? I got to see these guys for lunch yesterday - it was so much fun to catch up and hear how their beautiful families are doing! 

'And yes, @joshsaviano, I totally agree - *you guys* are like family... I mean, we DID grow up together, after all. #memories'
