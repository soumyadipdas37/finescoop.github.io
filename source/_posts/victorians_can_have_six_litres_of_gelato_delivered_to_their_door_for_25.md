Victorians finally have something to celebrate with an Italian mini mart launching home delivery of its six litre tubs of gelato - with customers paying $25 for the service.

Word about Zio Glen's Mini Mart spread quickly around the stage four and three lockdown zones - mainly on private Facebook groups - with Australians trying to stock up for the warmer seasons ahead.

There were hundreds of people from surrounding states 'jealous' of the premium service, as they could only watch on enviously as pistachio, rum and raisin and Tim Tam flavours were advertised on social media feeds.

'Thanks to the two ladies who posted about the six litre gelato for $25! We just received our order and they are massive.  Some of the fruit flavours are $12.50 for five litres too,' one woman said.

'They taste REALLY good. I got the pistachio and coconut for the large tubs and biscotti and dark chocolate for the smaller tubs,' said another.

A third added: 'We purchased the strawberry sorbet last week and have given out servings to neighbours and STILL have heaps leftover'.

There are 51 flavours to choose from on the website, including cherry ripe, green tea, strawberry cheesecake and rainbow, and by entering the code GELATO10 at the checkout you'll receive 10 per cent off each flavour

'Our fresh handmade gelato is traditionally prepared using the finest ingredients, including fresh milk and some cream,' the website read.

'Our Italian gelato chefs can create the most authentic flavours, which are rich in taste, to produce a true taste of Italy. You don't have to be an ice cream connoisseur to taste the difference in our gelato. 

'If your desired flavour is not listed below, please contact us for special order flavours.'

The website helpfully displays each gelato flavour and whether it contains dairy, soy, gluten, nuts, egg and sesame - for those with serious allergies (pistachio left and coconut right)

Orders can either be collected by the customer from their warehouse in Reservoir, 12 kilometres north of Melbourne's CBD, or a freezer truck can hand deliver them.  

It's free delivery state-wide on all order over $50 - which is only two tubs of gelato. 

'Well done Victoria! Finally you guys get something good! Damn it's not in Sydney as it looks so good,' one woman remarked on Facebook.

'Be right back I'm emptying out my deep freezer for gelato,' said another.
