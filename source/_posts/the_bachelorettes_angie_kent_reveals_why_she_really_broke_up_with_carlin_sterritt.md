The Bachelorette's Angie Kent has broken her silence on her split from Carlin Sterritt, saying their relationship fizzled out after they left the reality TV 'bubble'.

The former Gogglebox star, 30, told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday that their romance in the outside world didn't live up to the intense chemistry they shared during filming last year.

She also claimed that her ex-boyfriend's Christian values were a problem for her because she prefers 'spirituality' to organised relation.

'We finished filming in August last year, and Carlin and I decided to break up... it would have been around June,' she said.

'We were discussing, "What are we going to do? It's getting hard." But we didn't really announce [the split] until about July.'

Angie explained that they decided to call it quits after she left Sydney to spend time with her family in Queensland. 

'It just wasn't good. I just kept staying [in Queensland] and he was kind of like, "What are we doing?"'

Angie said they 'tried' to make things work, but the romantic 'bubble' they made for themselves on The Bachelorette didn't translate into reality. 

'It was a good for a while, until it wasn't,' she added. 

'Our values were different. I'm a little more spiritual, a little bit more carefree and wild, whereas he's more, you know, kind of...'

Radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson interrupted: 'A Christian boy.'

'He's a Christian boy!' Angie agreed. 'He's just... we're just different.'

Angie also set the record straight on rumours that their relationship started to fall apart after Carlin discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly.

She clarified that she reached out all the contestants from the final four to make sure they were okay, and not just Timm.

'There was nobody else involved in our break-up. It was just him and I,' she said.

'I was very open about the fact I spoke to my top four dudes right after filming, because you go on such a hectic love safari - you technically go through four break-ups with dudes that you really like. Of course I'm going to check in on them.

'I always told Carlin when I did. Timm and I stopped talking in December last year, and Carlin and I broke up only two months ago, so it had nothing to do with Timm.'
