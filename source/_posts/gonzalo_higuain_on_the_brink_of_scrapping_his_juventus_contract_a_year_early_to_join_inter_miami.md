Gonzalo Higuain's time at Juventus is coming to an end after his agent reportedly arrived in Italy to negotiate his exit ahead of a move to Inter Miami.

The Argentine striker is surplus to requirement at the Allianz Stadium and Andrea Pirlo is looking to replace him with Barcelona forward Luis Suarez.

And according to Sky Sport Italia, Tuttomercatoweb and more Italian outlets, they claim that Higuain's brother - Nicolas - landed in Italy on Tuesday for negotiations with Juventus over his departure.

He is set to meet Juventus' directors on Wednesday to discuss details of terminating Higuain's contract by mutual consent a year early - with talks set over how much of his remaining £6.3million net salary he will receive.

Once those talks have concluded, Higuain is likely to link up with David Beckham at his new MLS franchise Inter Miami.

The 32-year-old Argentine striker, who has won three Serie A titles with the club, has been informed by new manager Andrea Pirlo that he is not part of his plans going forward.

Pirlo is now on the brink of capturing Uruguayan striker Suarez from Barcelona after being told he would play no part under new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman.

Suarez now looks set to combine with Cristiano Ronaldo after years of partnering Lionel Messi up top at the Nou Camp.

He will be remembered very fondly in Barcelona, scoring an incredible 198 goals in 283 appearances for the Spanish giants.
