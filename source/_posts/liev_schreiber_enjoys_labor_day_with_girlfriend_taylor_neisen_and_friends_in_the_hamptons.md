Like many famous celebrities based on the East Coast, Liev Schreiber has been decamping to the upscale vacation enclave of the Hamptons on the tip of Long Island, New York during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

And the Scream star, 52, was again seen living it up with his girlfriend Taylor Neisen, 27, on Monday, as the pair enjoyed Labor Day festivities with friends.

Liev looked ruggedly handsome for the beach outing, modeling his shirtless physique in a pair of dark grey board shorts.

The father-of-two looked to have somewhat of a sunburn, but that didn't stop him from smiling as he carried around a purple Playmate cooler. 

He had on a silver wristwatch as well as a silver pendant around his neck, which hung against his hairy chest. 

Schreiber also donned a maroon trucker hat which read Amber Waves Farm.
