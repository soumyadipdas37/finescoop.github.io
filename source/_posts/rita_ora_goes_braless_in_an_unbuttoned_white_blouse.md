She is no stranger to a daring fashion choice.

And Rita Ora looked typically stylish in a plunging white shirt as she sang along to Little Mix's holiday in the back of a taxi on Wednesday evening. 

The singer, 29, went braless in the slightly unbuttoned blouse as she flashed her cleavage in the short clip which she shared to her Instagram Stories.

Sharing her love for the band, Rita wrote: 'I love these girls they always give me exactly what I want and more! @LittleMix.'

Rita's next video saw her miming along to Fantasia's When I See U, as she showed her appreciation by writing: 'How did I forget about these vocals? Wow.'

Rita wore her blonde locks loose in beachy waves, while opting for a dramatic look with a grey smokey-eye and a matte nude lip.

Adding a further quirky twist, she donned white and black geometric print boots.

Her blonde tresses were styles in tousled waves, with smoky shadow, winged liner and berry lipstick accentuating her beautiful features. 

Rita is now back in the UK after spending much of the summer soaking up the sun in Greece and Ibiza.

She was feeling nostalgic as she shared a video of herself striking a series of poses while on a yacht during her trip. 

The singer looked incredible in the clip as she displayed her jaw-dropping figure in a tiny orange and black bikini.

She captioned the montage: 'Little diary of my day yesterday. Tag your best friend that takes photos when they think you’re asleep lol.' 

Before Greece, Rita had a holiday in Ibiza with her friends and new beau Romain Gavras. 

The singer has been inducing envy with her picturesque bikini snaps shared from the Ultima Corfu villa. 

Her  clifftop holiday home in Corfu is certainly fit for a superstar, boasting seven suites, a two-level infinity pool and its own 78ft private yacht.
