Manchester City face a tricky first match of the season away to Wolves in the Premier League on Monday night. 

Pep Guardiola's side travel to Molineux after being granted a longer break following their exploits in the Champions League last season, which saw their campaign carry over into mid-August. 

Yet Wolves, who not only beat Sheffield United in their first game of the season last week, also memorably did the double over City last season. 

Sportsmail will provide all the team news, build-up and live commentary from Molineux, with kick-off at 8:15pm!
