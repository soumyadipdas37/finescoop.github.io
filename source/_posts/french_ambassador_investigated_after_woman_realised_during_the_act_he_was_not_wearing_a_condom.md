A French ambassador who allegedly had sex with a woman who didn't realise he wasn't wearing a condom is being investigated by Paris prosecutors.

The woman, 30, claims she is a victim of 'stealthing' after telling police she had spent part of the night at the home of the ambassador, 44, she had met through a dating site.   

A source close to the inquiry said: 'They had met up several times without any sexual relations. That evening, they had consensual sex.'

Confirming the report in French magazine Le Point, the source added: 'She asked him to use a condom but realised during the act that the man was not wearing one.'

The woman filed her complaint three days later.

The source did not identify him by name, while Le Point said only that he is based in the Middle East.

French law defines rape as 'any sexual penetration... committed against another through violence, force, threat or surprise'.

But no clear jurisprudence exists for 'stealthing', which is when a man removes a condom while having sex with a partner who requested he wear one.

The action can potentially expose him or her to HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.

A woman also risks being impregnated.

In January 2017, a court in Lausanne, Switzerland, handed a Frenchman a suspended 12-month prison sentence after convicting him of 'rape' for removing his condom without telling his partner.

A few months later, the sentence was upheld on appeal, but the court lowered the charge to 'a sexual act committed against a person unable to discern or resist it'.

A scene depicting stealthing was shown recently in Michaela Coel's hit BBC sitcom I May Destroy You, in which the man is labelled a rapist.
