Tottenham are set to turn their attentions to Antonio Rudiger as their move for Milan Skriniar stalls.

Rudiger, Sportsmail understands, is emerging as a serious alternative to Inter Milan defender Skriniar as Jose Mourinho looks to bolster his options in central defence.

Historically Chelsea have shown a reluctance to sell players to their direct Premier League rivals - but there is a sense the Stamford Bridge would consider allowing Rudiger leave for their arch rivals provided the deal suited them.

Antonio Rudiger has fallen out of favour and is well down Frank Lampard's pecking order

Rudiger hasn't been in the squad for three of Chelsea's four games and Spurs are interested

Rudiger's days under Chelsea boss Frank Lampard are numbered after being frozen out during the start of the season.

The Germany international hasn't played a single minute of club football so far and hasn't even been named in the squad for three of Chelsea's four games this season.

It is understood he won't be involved in tonight's EFL Cup clash against Spurs.

Rudiger is open to leaving Chelsea - but the club face a delicate balancing act in how they engineer his exit.

The 27-year-old is approaching the final 18 months of his deal so loaning out the central defender for the season would open the door to losing Rudiger for nothing at the end of the 2021/22 campaign.

If they were to consider a loan move for the defender, it is understood Chelsea would insist on the German signing a 12 month extension to avoid that scenario.

Selling Rudiger on a permanent basis would also be riddled complexities with rivals clubs knowing he doesn't feature in Lampard's plans, essentially decreasing his value.

Jose Mourinho is keen on a swoop for Rudiger as he looks to strengthen his Spurs back-line

Thiago Silva's summer arrival has knocked Rudiger out of contention at Stamford Bridge

Spurs have been trying to strike a deal for Skriniar this week but can't agree on a price; Inter valuing the player at Â£36million.

That has forced Tottenham into considering other options and Rudiger heads the list of alternatives.

But the former Roma man is also wanted by Paris Saint-Germain, a move that could suit both parties. West Ham have also been credited with an interest.
