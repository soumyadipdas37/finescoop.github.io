Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster could reportedly return to Swansea City on loan following a successful spell with the Championship side last season.

The 20-year-old has been one of the most sought-after young stars in England after an impressive loan-spell at Steve Cooper's side has now led to Premier League interest. 

Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace have each made official approaches for Brewster, only to be informed the club and player are in no rush to make any decision just yet.

However each of those clubs have set their sights elsewhere with Newcastle and Aston Villa both signing a striker in the last week. 

Newcastle signed Callum Wilson from Bournemouth for £20m and Aston Villa completed a club-record £28m deal for Ollie Watkins from Brentford on Wednesday.

Crystal Palace meanwhile are on the verge of reaching a loan agreement with Chelsea over Michy Batshuayi.

And as reported by the Telegraph, this has brought Swansea City back into the picture, which could see Brewster again reunited with former Liverpool academy coach Cooper.

Swansea would be very keen on a deal after he impressed on-loan during the second-half of last season, where he scored 11 goals in 22 appearances. 

Brighton are also interested in the 20-year-old but Brewster will have to decide how likely he is to force his way into the starting line-up if he makes a Premiership move.

Liverpool could be tempted by a £25m bid if it includes a buy-back clause to protect their asset, however a loan deal still looks most likely before the transfer window closes in October.

Returning to Swansea, where he would be a guaranteed starter, is a consideration to give him a full year's senior football, with Premier League interest likely to remain strong next year.
