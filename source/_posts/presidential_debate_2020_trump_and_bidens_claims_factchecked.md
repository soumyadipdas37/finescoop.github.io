President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden squared off Tuesday night in their crucial first debate of the 2020 campaign, the most pivotal opportunity yet for them to outline starkly different visions for a country facing multiple crises.

Here we analyse what each candidate has said:

FACT: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid says a range from 50 to 129 million not including the elderly that have pre-existing conditions 

CLAIM: Trump claimed Biden called him xenophobic 

FACT: Biden said in March 'banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop' the virus. 

The day after Trump’s announcement on China Biden, without mentioning the virus, said: 'We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.'

CLAIM:  Biden said the US has '5 percent — 4 percent — of the world’s population, 20 percent of the coronavirus deaths'

FACT: This is true 

CLAIM: Trump said the country is doing  'record business' 

FACT: Unemployment has fallen from 14.7 per cent in April to 8.4 per cent

CLAIM: Trump said the US is 'weeks away from a vaccine'

FACT: Health officials have said we may have to wait until next summer until a vaccine is widely available

CLAIM: Trump said: 'You agree with Bernie Sanders, who is far-left on the manifesto, we call it' 

FACT: Biden and Sen. Sanders formed a joint task force in May to unify Democrats on issues including health care, producing a 110-page set of policy recommendations

CLAIM: Trump said he is 'cutting drug prices'

FACT: The president has signed executive orders lower drug prices but experts doubt the relief that will provide 

CLAIM:  Trump said: 'I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks'

FACT: The president has repeatedly been seen in public without a mask; he often mocks Biden for wearing one 

CLAIM: Trump said: 'I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing'

FACT: Manufacturing employment has risen by just under 500,000 jobs since Trump became president. The sector is currently down by more than 200,000 jobs from when he took office
