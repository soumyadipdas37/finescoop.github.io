Steph McGovern's day-time TV show Packed Lunch has been hit by a ratings blow just weeks after it relaunched.

The British journalist, 38, returned to screens on September 14 after she had been presenting The Steph Show for Channel 4 from her home during lockdown.

However Barb viewing figures from Tuesday revealed that at 12.56pm there weren't any viewers tuned in to the new format, reports The Mirror.  

Tricky start: Steph McGovern's day-time TV show Packed Lunch has been hit by a ratings blow just weeks after it relaunched  

Although boasting a range of big-name guests, such as Vogue Williams, Oti Mabuse and Chris Kamara, Packed Lunch is competing against well established show Loose Women on ITV.

A source said: 'It was a tough call to go up against such an established and well-loved show as Loose Women and there's no doubt the decision is hurting C4 and these ratings show it.'

However Channel 4 said: 'On Tuesday Steph's Packed Lunch attracted an average audience of 87,000 viewers from 12.30pm – 2.10pm and drew 204,000 at its peak. 

'Steph has brought a blast of energy to our daytime line-up and we're delighted with the live shows the team has produced.'

Getting started: The show, which is filmed from a studio in Leeds, didn't have any viewers at 12.56pm according to Barb rating figures (Steph is pictured on the set of her show)

It is thought that Loose Women had a high of a million viewers on the same day.

MailOnline has contacted Channel 4 for a comment.

Steph has previously spoken about being 'nervous' ahead of fronting her show and revealed that she'd blame herself if it didn't do well.

She said: 'But yeah, when your name's on the tin, there's no one else to blame if it's rubbish. If it's rubbish, it's my fault.' 

Packed Lunch is filmed from a Channel 4 studio in Leeds and also sees a host of top chefs rustling up delicious lunchtime treats, including Jack Stein, Doctor Rupy Aujla and former Great British Bake Off winner John Whaite.

Hiatus: Steph's Channel 4 talk show took a small hiatus amid the coronavirus lockdown, amid claims the decision to broadcast from her Harrogate home infuriated neighbours

It comes after Steph announced her Channel 4 talk show would go on hiatus amid the coronavirus lockdown, amid claims the decision to broadcast from her Harrogate home infuriated neighbours back in April.

Steph hosted The Steph Show from her home in Yorkshire but revealed via Twitter that the show will cease airing, for now, on May 7.

The star, who is mother to a baby girl with her partner, cited family reasons when breaking the news to her followers.

She wrote: ‘As much as I’ve loved doing a lockdown show at home I never expected it to go on this long. We’ve decided it’s time to have a break and give my family our home back.

Steph continued: ‘The proper prog will be launching when the Leeds studio is sorted, I may still be wearing slippers.’   

She added: ‘The last locked down version of #TheStephShow will be next Thurs 7th May. ‘Then the plan is to launch again at our fancy studios at Leeds Docks in a couple of months, once they’re safely up and running.’  

The news came after it was claimed that Steph broadcasting from home had left her neighbours unimpressed.      

According to The Sun, other residents were allegedly beginning to get hacked off by the to-ing and fro-ing filming from home entails.

It was claimed that 'the production equipment parked outside and the steady flow of deliveries for The Steph Show have gone down badly'.
