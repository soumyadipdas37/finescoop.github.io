As one of Australia's most successful activewear moguls, Pip Edwards rarely puts a foot wrong when dressing for the gym. 

But the P.E. Nation designer, 40, raised eyebrows on Tuesday by wearing a set of nude-coloured leggings that made her appear naked at first glance.

Instagram fans did a double take as the mother-of-one uploaded a photo of herself modelling the optical illusion tights inside a Pilates studio.

Posing next to a reformer machine, a pouty-looking Pip wrote in the caption: 'Hands down my most favourite place to be ... the Pilates studio.' 

Posting to Instagram Stories, Pip also shared photos of herself performing various Pilates moves.

In some photos, Pip's leggings were practically indistinguishable from the rest of her natural skin.

It comes after Pip recently released her debut uni-sex activewear collection.

Designed with co-founded Claire Tregoning, the new range features slounchy trackpants and oversized hoodies. 

It's unclear whether P.E. Nation will release nude-coloured leggings to accommodate her male customers, however.

Giveaway signs: Luckily, Pip's leggings featured zippers at the bottom - a giveaway sign that she wasn't nude from the waist down 

Working hard! Pip has previously credited Pilates as the secret behind her incredible physique 

Aside from her business success, Pip is also enjoying a blossoming romance with former cricketer Michael Clarke. 

The pair began dating sometime in late 2019, following Michael's split from his wife-of-seven-years, Kyly. 

Their relationship didn't become public knowledge, however, until after the Clarkes announced their separation on February 12.
