Miley confirmed she'd split from Cody after less than a year of dating on Instagram in August, telling fans the pair are taking time apart to 'work on' themselves.

The Wrecking Ball hitmaker said she remains friends with the Australian singer, who she has known for a decade. 

Referencing her split from ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in August last year, Miley began: 'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that. 

'So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up,' she added.

She continued:'It was confirmed by a "reliable source" even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it.

'But right now, two halves can't make a whole and we're individually just working on ourselves to become the people that we wanna be, like everybody else at this age.' 

Miley added: 'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza.

'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not.'

The couple began dating in September 2019, shortly after Miley had ended her fling with U.S. reality star Kaitlynn Carter.

She was previously married to actor Liam Hemsworth, but they separated in August last year after just seven months of marriage.
