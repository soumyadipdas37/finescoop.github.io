Good Morning Britain presenter Ranvir Singh said that the Strictly contestants have not started training yet despite the new series starting in a few weeks. 

And moreover, the celebrities have not even met their training partners yet. 

The 43-year-old was quizzed by her fellow hosts ahead of her appearance on the BBC One show which begins on October 24 with a one-off launch show on 12.  

'We haven't even met out partners': GMB's Ranvir Singh shocked Susanna Reid on GMB on Wednesday when she revealed the Strictly contestants haven't begun training yet 

She can't believe it: 2013 Strictly contestant Susanna said that normally at this point, contestants would be 'up to their eyes in sequins'

2013 Strictly contestant Susanna Reid was shocked and said that usually by this point in the year, contestants are normally in the thick of training.

She said: 'In a normal season, you would now be up to your eyeballs in training, in sequins, in glitter.' 

Ranvir replied: 'It's all happening a bit later. We can't - we've not met our partner yet.'

She added: 'I am eating fewer Pringles if that counts towards training, but that's as far as it got.'

Ranvir said: 'It's all happening a bit later. We can't - we've not met our partner yet.'

She added: 'I am eating fewer Pringles if that counts towards training, but that's as far as it got'

Piers Morgan asked Ranvir if she would like to be partnered up with anyone in particular and she said having a laugh was key. 

She said: 'Anyone who's got a sense of humour.

'The thing is, it's to do with the height. So I've got to figure out who the short one is.' 

Ranvir recently confirmed she had split from her husband, Ranjeet Singh Dehal, a few years ago. The pair share a son called Tushaan, eight. 

Question time: Piers Morgan asked Ranvir if she would like to be partnered up with anyone in particular and she said having a laugh was key. She said: 'Anyone who's got a sense of humour'

Meanwhile, it was recently reported that Strictly will operate with a socially-distanced live studio audience when the series kicks off. 

The BBC One show confirmed it will return with an eighteenth consecutive series in September, and has since outlined the safety measures put in place to ensure it continues to be aired in front of its traditional live studio audience.  

Producers have revealed that family bubbles of four will be allowed to watch the show while it is filmed at Hertfordshire's Elstree Studios, while face masks and social distancing will be compulsory for all members of the public. 

A step back in time: Susanna was paired with professional dancer Kevin Clifton when she appeared on the show in 2013 - she finished as a runner-up on the eleventh series

Alleviating logistical concerns regarding the production of the show, a tweet posted on Monday read: 'To make the most if limited space we’ll have in the studio this year because of our social distancing measures, for the first time ever tickets will be allocated to groups of four, allowing you to come along as a family bubble / household group.

'We’ll be able to seat family groups of up to four people from the same household / social bubble at cabaret tables and in balcony seating. Cabaret tables and balcony seats will be allocated randomly, in advance of your arrival at the studio.' 

While the show attempts to move on following the coronavirus pandemic, it's understood that its annual Blackpool special - a favourite among fans - will not go ahead for the first time in its history.
