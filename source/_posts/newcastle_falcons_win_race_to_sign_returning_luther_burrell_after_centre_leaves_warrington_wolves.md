Luther Burrell is set to make an immediate return to rugby union with Newcastle Falcons.

Burrell announced in The Mail on Sunday last week that he was cutting short his rugby league contract with Warrington Wolves and was desperate to return to the sport he loves. He was then contacted by three Premiership clubs and one French Top 14 club.

The former England centre will opt for a two-year deal with Newcastle, who will return to the Premiership for the 2020-21 season.Â 

The deal will be announced on Sunday. The postponed campaign is not expected to start until the end of the year but Burrell could make his Falcons debut in a friendly against Ealing Trailfinders in November.
