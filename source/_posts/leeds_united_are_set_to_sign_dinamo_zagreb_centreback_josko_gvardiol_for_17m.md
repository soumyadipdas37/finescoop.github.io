Leeds United are closing on the £17.6million signing of Dinamo Zagreb centre back Josko Gvardiol.

Highly-rated Gvardiol, 18, has been watched by Manchester City and Bayern Munich in recent months and can play at left-back also.

The Elland Road club remain in talks with Udinese over a £30m deal for attacking midfielder Rodrigo de Paul and have been offered the chance to sign Rafinha from Barcelona though he has struggled with injuries and form.

Leeds are discussing a £1.3m fee with Feyenoord for Dutch winger Crysencio Summerville, 19, and have released goalkeepers Will Huffer and Kamil Miazek.

Should the newly-promoted side secure the signing of Gvardiol, he will add to a busy summer for the club in the transfer window. 

The Whites have already brought in Rodrigo from Valencia for £27m, while Robin Koch has arrived from Freiburg and goalkeeper Illan Meslier was signed from Lorient.
