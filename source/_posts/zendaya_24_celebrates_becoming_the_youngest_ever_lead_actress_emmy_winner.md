After ringing in the big day at home with her nearest and dearest, Zendaya could not stop littering social media with excited reaction. 

She wrote on the photosharing site: ' Still on cloud nine... so grateful, still speechless, to all my friends and family who have tested/tweeted/called etc...

'I promise I will get back to you tomorrow when I've wrapped my head around this amazing night, until then... gonna go to sleep and make sure this isn't a dream.'#

Such was her excitement, Zendaya changed her profile picture on Instagram to feature a video still from the moment she discovered her win.  

Earning it: At just 24-year-old, Zendaya was the youngest to ever earn Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her work on HBO series Euphoria at the 72nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday night

Aside from Zendaya's win, HBO show Succession scooped the Outstanding Drama Series prize, while Schitt's Creek swept the board across the comedy categories.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the no-audience event was presented by Jimmy Kimmel at Los Angeles' empty Staples Center Arena.

Winners accepted their awards over video call from their homes around the world for the first time to adhere to California's social distancing rules. 

At just 24, the screen star - full name Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman - beat out a very impressive field of actresses including: Jennifer Aniston (The Morning Show), Olivia Colman (The Crown), Jodie Comer (Killing Eve), Laura Linney (Ozark), and Sandra Oh (Killing Eve).

Zendaya was shocked by the win as she said: 'I'm really, really nervous. Okay. Okay. Oh, gosh. I just want to say thank you to the TV academy, and all the other women, this is crazy. Thank you, HBO and A24 for your support...

'Thank you to my family and my team. To the incredible cast and crew of Euphoria.' 

On the series she plays protagonist Rue Bennett as it centers around a group of high school students as they grapple with issues of drugs, sex, and violence.

She gave a shoutout to her character as she said: 'I'm so lucky and I'm inspired by everything you do. And Sam, I appreciate you so much. I'm so grateful you trusted me with your story, Rue.'

'I'm so grateful you trusted me with your story, Rue': On the series she plays protagonist Rue Bennett as it centers around a group of high school students as they grapple with issues of drugs, sex, and violence and even gave a shoutout to her character

Zendaya made sure to acknowledge the COVID-19 pandemic as well as unrest surrounding racial injustice in America as she said: 'And I feel like this is a weird time to be celebrating, but there is hope in the young people out there...

'I know our TV show doesn't always feel like a great example of that, but there is hope in the young people. And to my peers out there doing the work in the streets, I see you, I admire you, and I thank you...

'And thank you so, so much. This is -- whoa, okay. Thank you.'

The young star was surrounded by her friends and family who couldn't help but cheer her own during the duration of her speech.
