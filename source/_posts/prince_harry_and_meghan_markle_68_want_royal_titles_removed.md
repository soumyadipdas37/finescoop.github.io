More than two thirds of Britons believe Prince Harry and Meghan Markle should have their royal titles taken away from them, a new survey suggests.

The study for Tatler magazine also showed the majority of respondents believed the Duchess of Sussex, 39, should not be commenting on US politics.

It comes as the couple this week drew criticism for participating in a Time 100 video urging Americans to vote, which was perceived as critical of President Donald Trump, although the Tatler survey was conducted last month.

The data, collected by research consultancy Savanta Comres, polled 4,174 British adults, only taking results from those who expressed an opinion when questioned.

More than two thirds of Britons believe Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, pictured in a Time 100 video urging Americans to vote, should have their royal titles taken away from them, a new survey suggests

It found 68 per cent agreed Harry, 36, and Meghan should have their titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex taken from them, following their step down from royal life and their move to the US.

A total of 63 per cent agreed Meghan, although American, should not be commenting on US politics.

And 35 per cent concurred that the duchess 'wants to be president of the United States one day'. 

Harry and Meghan's video message urging Americans to vote, which hinted that they support Democrat Joe Biden, drew criticism from President Donald Trump.

Speaking from the White House podium on Wednesday, the president said: 'I'm not a fan of hers... I would say this - and she has probably heard that - I wish a lot of luck to Harry because he's going to need it.'

The Sussexes, now ensconced in their $14billion Santa Barbara mansion, made their remarks just weeks before the November 3 elections with Americans in some states already going to the polls.

Harry urged people to 'reject hate speech' while Meghan called it the 'most important election of our lifetime' in remarks which made waves on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Royal insiders voiced concern in Britain, where the Queen and her family are expected to remain politically neutral at all times, with one saying that Harry and Meghan had 'crossed a line'. 

Yesterday Meghan made a surprise appearance on the season finale of America's Got Talent to send a video message to singer Archie Williams, who was wrongly imprisoned for 36 years until his release last year

Buckingham Palace also distanced itself from Harry's remarks by saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the royal family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'.  .

Today it emerged Harry and Meghan's last official tour as members of the Royal Family cost British taxpayers almost a quarter of a million pounds.

Royal accounts published today show £245,643 was spent on scheduled flights and a private jet for the couple and their entourage on the high-profile trip to South Africa, Botswana, Angola and Malawi last autumn, making it the most expensive royal trip of the year.

Yesterday Meghan made a surprise appearance on the season finale of America's Got Talent to send a video message to singer Archie Williams, who was wrongly imprisoned for 36 years until his release last year.

While Williams finished in the bottom half of the Top 10, his story touched the heart of the Duchess of Sussex, who appeared in a surprise video from her home.  

Speaking to the singer, she said: ‘Hi Archie! I just wanted to let you know that we have been so moved by your story, and we have been cheering you on every week.'

Meghan joked that her support for Williams was 'not just because we’re partial to the name,’ making the connection between the singer’s name and that of her son Archie, 16 months. 

The results of the Tatler survey are contained in the November issue of the magazine, available on newsstands and via digital download next Thursday.
