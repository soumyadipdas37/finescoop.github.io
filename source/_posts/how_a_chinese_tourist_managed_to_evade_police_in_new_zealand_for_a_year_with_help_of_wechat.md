New documents have shed light on a bizarre disappearance that saw a Chinese tourist vanish in New Zealand, only to show up a year later.

Biao Zhang was 29 when he arrived as part of a scenic tour group on June 14, 2018. 

Six days later he told his roommate at the Surrey Hotel in Grey Lynn, Auckland, he was stepping outside for a cigarette. 

But he never returned and the next day Travelmore informed police the Chinese student was missing.

Police probed every possibility from foul play to a deliberate visa overstay, however investigators come up with nothing.

On Tuesday, documents uncovered by New Zealand media under the Official Information Act revealed the disappearance was orchestrated over the Chinese social media platform WeChat.

Zhang rocked up to a police station in New Zealand more than a year later in 2019, to hand himself in.

He said a mysterious figure had arranged for him go missing and that the trip to New Zealand, as well as his place on the tour group, was all part of the plan, Stuff NZ reported.

The entire operation had been had been organised on WeChat and Zhang said he had never ever met the individuals he was messaging, let alone knew of their identities. 

Zhang said a mysterious figure he contacted on WeChat had arranged for him go missing 

Zhang offered no explanation when interrogated as to why he had planned to disappear.

Nor did he reveal where he had been staying during the time he was missing.

Two witnesses reported seeing Zhang at the Epsom Badminton Hall in Auckland in June 2019.

The women said they recognised Zhang’s face from the news but when police followed up on the sighting they uncovered no sign of the Chinese national.  

At one point during the investigation, New Zealand police organised for Chinese investigators to visit Zhang’s parents in Anshan city.

They told officers their son had returned to China and was working in a another city.

Zhang's parents admitted their son was working for a construction site in Christchurch and was living on Oldwood Street in Bishopdale (pictured)

But investigators found no record of Zhang ever re-entering China.

His parents later admitted to police he had been working for a construction site in Christchurch and was living on Oldwood Street in Bishopdale.

When police in New Zealand searched the Christchurch address given by the parents, there was still no sign of Zhang.  

He eventually turned himself in to police, was served with a detention notice, and processed by New Zealand's immigration department.

A spokesman from Immigration NZ said Zhang was deported in November 2019.

But exactly what happened to the wayward Chinese student remains a mystery.
