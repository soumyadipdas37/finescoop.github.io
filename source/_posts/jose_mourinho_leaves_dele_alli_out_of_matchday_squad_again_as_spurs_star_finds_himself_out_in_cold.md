Dele Alli has once again been excluded from Jose Mourinho's Tottenham squad for the visit of Newcastle on Sunday afternoon. 

The midfielder played for an hour during Spurs' 3-1 Europa League victory over Shkendija in midweek, but Alli has not been named in the starting XI or among the substitutes for the Premier League fixture.

The England international has been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain in recent days, but the Ligue 1 champions are reportedly set to withdraw from negotiations. 





Mourinho insists he does not see him leaving before the transfer deadline next month. 'Since Dele arrived from MK Dons he's had ups and downs,' he said. 

'Fabulous periods and also other periods when he disappears from the top level. When this lack of consistency happens in a player it is normal that when you are in great form you play because you deserve to and when you are not in a good moment you don't play.

'He is selected. No decision yet about starting or on the bench, but if he is on the pitch for one minute or 90 he has to show us. Pure and simple.'
