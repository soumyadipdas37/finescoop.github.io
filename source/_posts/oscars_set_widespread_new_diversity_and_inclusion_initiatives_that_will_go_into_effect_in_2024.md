Inclusion: Films vying for Best Picture in 2022 and 2023 will be required to fill out a confidential Academy Inclusion Standards form, though meeting inclusion thresholds will not be required for Best Picture eligibility until 2024

The guidelines were developed by Academy governors DeVon Franklin and Jim Gianopulos, who lead a task force to develop the standards.

The standards were inspired by British Film Institute (BFI) Diversity Standards, which determine funding for some films in the UK and eligibility in some categories of the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) Awards.

These guidelines, though, 'were adapted to serve the specific needs of the Academy,' which consulted with the Producers Guild of America (PGA).

'The Academy is committed to playing a vital role in helping make this a reality,' they continued.

'We believe these inclusion standards will be a catalyst for long-lasting, essential change in our industry,' the statement concluded.
