Daniel Podence has received high praise on social media after he pulled off an audacious nutmeg against Kevin De Bruyne during Wolves' Premier League defeat by Manchester City. 

The winger displayed excellent skill to tap the ball through the City midfielder's legs and cross perfectly for Raul Jimenez who headed past Ederson and into the net.

Although De Bruyne is not renowned for his defensive capabilities, Podence understandably won plaudits from football fans after he outwitted one of the most talented players on the planet.









One person posted: 'All of Kevin De Bruyne's assists now belong to Daniel Podence.' 

Meanwhile, another fan Tweeted: 'Daniel Podence just sent Kevin De Bruyne for a Belgian waffle. Lovely assist from the pint-sized wizard.'

One person even accused the Portuguese of 'sending De Bruyne back to Chelsea'. 

De Bruyne once again displayed his outstanding talent at the other end of the pitch as City kicked off their season with a win at Molineux, playing a part in all three goals scored by Pep Gardiola's team. 







The 29-year-old was taken down by Roman Saiss in the first half before picking himself up to score emphatically from the penalty sot. 

The Belgium international then played anther incisive pass to Raheem Sterling who set up Phil Foden with a tap in to double the visitors' lead.

Podence missed two opportunities to half the deficit, first shooting wide from the edge of the box and then putting too much weight on his lob over Ederson. 

12 minutes of normal time remained when Jimenez headed in from Podence's teasing cross, but City wrapped up all three points in stoppage time as Gabriel Jesus' deflected beyond Rui Patricio after De Bruyne won back possession.
