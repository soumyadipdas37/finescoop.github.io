A convicted killer already serving two life sentences asked a judge to give him the death penalty and warned he will kill again, after stabbing a fellow inmate to death in an Indiana prison.  

Tommy P. Holland, 45, of Indianapolis was charged with murder for stabbing Clifford Baggett, 28, to death at the Pendleton Correctional Facility on August 9 2019. 

Holland, who is behind bars for the 2015 slayings of employees at a supermarket and at a gas station, allegedly stabbed Baggett 10 times including in the arm, chest and buttocks in the attack.  

The killer appeared in Madison Circuit Court this week where he refused to accept a deal and vowed to kill again if the judge didn't execute him.   

Convicted killer Tommy P. Holland, who was already serving two life sentences, asked a judge to give him the death penalty and warned he will kill again, after stabbing a fellow inmate to death in an Indiana prison

'I will continue to drop bodies until you give me the death penalty,' Holland told the court, according to Madison County prosecutor Rodney Cummings.

Holland rejected a deal in which he would have pleaded guilty and received a third sentence of life without the possibility of parole, The Herald Bulletin reported.

Instead, the murderer told Judge Andrew Hopper he wanted to be executed. 

Holland's attorney Bryan Williams confirmed Holland had made the request to the court against his advice and said he believes his client is 'serious' about his threat.  

'In 27 years as a defense attorney I've never had that happen before,' he said. 

'Without question, he was serious about the request.'

The judge said he would consider Holland's request for the death penalty but is leaning against it because he did not want to waste taxpayer money.

'I don't want to spend the county's money,' he said. 

'If there is no trial it would cost about $50,000. A trial and the appeals could cost $750,000. 

'It's not an appropriate way to spend taxpayer dollars.' 

Cummings said Holland will be segregated from other inmates for another year before being returned to the general population.

He said he was urging the Department of Correction to exercise caution in allowing the killer access to other inmates and prison staff following Holland's threats to kill again.  

'I have contacted the prosecutor in LaPorte County of a potential problem and am writing to the Department of Correction for them to exercise reasonable caution to prevent his (Holland) access to other inmates, nurses and correctional officers,' Cummings said.

Holland's attorney said he was requesting an evaluation to see if the killer is mentally competent.  

He said he believes he will be found competent and 'will be a problem for the Department of Correction'.

Holland was captured on surveillance footage attacking Baggett in the Pendleton Correctional Facility last year, according to an affidavit.  

Holland is allegedly seen entering the cell block holding something near his waistband and paces back and forth before stopping behind a stairwell. 

Holland, who is behind bars for the 2015 slayings of employees at a supermarket and at a gas station, allegedly stabbed Baggett 10 times including in the arm, chest and buttocks in the attack at the Pendleton Correctional Facility (above) 

The affidavit then says Baggett opened a door in front of the stairwell and is attacked by Holland.

Holland is allegedly seen stabbing the victim several times in the back and on the body as the victim falls to the floor.

An autopsy revealed Baggett suffered 10 'sharp force injuries' on his upper right arm, right underarm, right ear, right neck, right chest, left chest, left forearm, left palm, lower back and buttocks.

Holland was convicted in 2015 for the murders of workers at a Mars Hill supermarket and a Marathon gas station. 

The convicted killer is also a suspect in two other murders.

He is now being held in the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.
