Seeing yourself grace the cover of Vogue must be an incredible experience for anyone.

But for actress Emma Corrin, 24, barely known before she was picked to play Princess Diana in Netflix hit The Crown, the experience must have been particularly difficult to believe.

And she was so surprised to spot herself on the fashion magazine cover in a newsagent’s window while walking her dog that she decided to record the moment with a photo.

'So surreal!': Emma Corrin was starstruck by her own image when she spotted her glam Vogue covershoot image on display at a newsagents while out walking her dog

Wearing square-shaped sunglasses, black boots, bright-yellow trousers and a tanktop, Miss Corrin’s look in her picture is in stark contrast to her image in Vogue, where she is dressed in a glamorous blue dress.

‘Still so bloody surreal!!!’ posted Miss Corrin, 24, alongside the photo on Instagram. 

Cambridge University graduate Miss Corrin was picked to portray the ‘People’s Princess’ last year despite having only a handful of small roles to her name prior to her audition.

She told Vogue that playing Diana has given her a feeling of rapport with the late princess. ‘I feel I’ve got to know Diana like you would a friend,’ Miss Corrin said.

‘I know that sounds really weird, but I get a great sense of companionship from her.’  

Ms Corrin also revealed to Vogue that she keeps a vibrator in her handbag – just like the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

The actress admitted that she likes using the sex toy as a way to 'unwind'.

In a recent video interview she said of the gadget as she revealed the contents of her bag: 'It’s great if you’re stressed and need to unwind. Also, it kind of looks like a lipstick so, you know, nice and subtle.'

Princess Diana had a 'secret mascot' in the form of a sex toy, which she took with her on all overseas trips as a good luck charm, her former bodyguard revealed in 2016. 

Royal protection officer Ken Wharfe said the marital aid – which was referred to as 'Le Gaget', or 'the gadget' – was purchased on a 'wild staff night out' in Paris in 1992.

Wharfe claimed he then persuaded Diana's sister Sarah McCorquodale to hide the sex toy in the Princess of Wales' bag the next day. 

The shock revelation was made by Wharfe in an updated edition of his book Diana: Closely Guarded Secret. 

He added that the Princess 'loved pranks and practical jokes' and thought the toy was 'hilarious' before she quickly made it her 'secret mascot for foreign trips'. 

The Crown season 4 will be available to watch on Netflix on November 15.
