A man allegedly armed with a gun and his girlfriend have been arrested following an intensive police search that saw an entire town put into lockdown as officers conducted a search.

 Alex Blake, 28, and his 30-year-old girlfriend allegedly entered South Australia from Queensland on Tuesday - a breach of coronavirus border closures.

The pair were finally arrested late on Wednesday afternoon following high speed chases and helicopter searches in SA's far north.

Blake and his girlfriend allegedly crossed the border in a stolen Toyota Hilux Utility on Tuesday.

He was allegedly armed with a gun, Nine News reported.  

Breyten Ward, Leigh Creek Petrol Station manager, said officers told people in the area to close their businesses while they searched for the accused.

'About two hours ago they told us to lock everything down,' Mr Ward told the ABC.

'We locked the pub down, the petrol station down … I think the police have it under control.'  

The man was expected to be extradited to Queensland for local charges once the charges in South Australia had been dealt with.  

Blake's car was allegedly seen speeding down the wrong side of the road while being chased by a police car at Port Augusta on Tuesday afternoon.

Blake allegedly almost ran over a roadhouse manager in Innamincka while speeding off after not paying for his petrol. 

The pair were finally arrested late on Wednesday afternoon following high speed chases and helicopter searches in the state's far north. Pictured: Vehicle allegedly driving down wrong way on road

He was spotted again at 1pm on Wednesday before his arrest at 3.45pm.

'PolAir then followed the utility from the air as it continued along the Outback Highway towards Leigh Creek where it turned onto Old Beltana Road and headed north before turning onto Warraweena Station,' SA Police said in a statement.

'The vehicle then stopped in scrub.'  

He is also believed to be responsible for another petrol theft in Hawker, near the Flinders Ranges. 

The couple are expected to be charged with border breach, acts to endanger life, driving to evade police and petrol thefts.

They will both appear at Port Augusta Magistrates Court on Thursday.
