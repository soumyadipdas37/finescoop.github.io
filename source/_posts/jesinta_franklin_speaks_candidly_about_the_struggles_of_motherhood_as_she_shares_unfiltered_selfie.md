She's taken a step back from the spotlight after the birth of her beautiful daughter, Tullulah, back in February.

And on Sunday, Jesinta Franklin (née Campbell) shared an unfiltered moment in her bathroom. 

Taking to Instagram, the brunette stunner shared a photo of herself standing in a beige robe as she rested her head on her hand.

'Sunday night is usually my self care night but it didn't quite go to plan this evening,' Jesinta began. 

'I felt like I was chasing my tail all day and spent tonight catching up once Lulu was asleep,' she added. 

The beauty said while it was a hassle, she did get organised. 

'Finally got myself sorted for the week ahead. I like to get organised on a Sunday so my week can run smoothly.'

Jesinta's sweet photo comes after she revealed she's bouncing back to her pre-baby body and packed away all her maternity clothing. 

In July, she posted a picture of some of her designer heels, which she had just taken out of her cupboard. 

'Hello old friends... finally (!!!!) packed away all my maternity clothing yesterday and discovered lots of fun things in my wardrobe I'd totally forgotten about!' Jesinta wrote on Instagram.

Her husband Buddy cheered her on and commented: 'Bring out the heels!' 

Jesinta and Buddy Franklin announced they were expecting a child in August last year.

The couple tied the knot back in November 2016 at the lavish yet intimate ceremony  at Wildenstein Gardens in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. 

Buddy proposed to Jesinta in December 2014 after 14 months of dating.
