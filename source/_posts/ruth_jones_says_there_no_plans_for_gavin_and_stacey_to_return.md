Ruth Jones has revealed that there are 'no plans' to Gavin and Stacey to return this Christmas, as she's been unable to see James Corden amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The actress, 53, admitted she and James have to be 'in the same room' to write their episodes, but the presenter has been holed up in the US due to travel restrictions.

The news will come as a disappointment to many fans after the long-awaited Christmas Special ended on a heart-stopping cliffhanger, with Nessa proposing for Smithy after confessing her love for him.

Not yet! Ruth Jones, 53, has revealed that there are 'no plans' to Gavin and Stacey to return this Christmas, as she's been unable to see James Corden amid the COVID-19 pandemic

Ruth told Lorraine Kelly: 'It's lovely that people ask me. People always say ''I'm really sorry to ask''.'

'I wish I could say yes but as always been the case, James and I love to write together in the same room and that's just not possible at the moment because he's in America and I'm in the UK. There aren't any plans at the moment but, who knows?'

Ruth did briefly reprise her role as Nessa during lockdown for a hilarious clip which saw the no-nonsense Welsh woman reminding everyone to adhere to social distancing.

She added: 'The reason I love her is because she doesn't care what other people think at all. I think that's a good life philosophy to have.'

Fans were left speechless on Christmas Day when the long-awaited special ended on a shocking cliffhanger, a decade after the beloved sitcom had last aired on screen.

The series was penned by Ruth and James, who also starred as on-off lovers Nessa and Smithy alongside Mathew Horne as Gavin and Joanna Page as Stacey.

Asked how she's been spending the lockdown, she said: 'I did a lot of cleaning out during lockdown and found lots of old letters. 

'One friend wrote to me when she was like 11. To go back in time and realise your friendship was a lovely thing.'  

Ruth was a guest on Lorraine to chat about her new book which tells the story of three Welsh women.

She explained: 'With what everything is going through now, friendship couldn't be more important. 

'I've written about three Welsh girls and it's all about whether friendship can stand the test of time. There's not a single mention of COVID in there.

'This story spans over four decades. You'd have to work out whether you'd have to have a different actress or just have them wear prosthetics.'

Lorraine airs weekdays from 9am on ITV.
