Martin Odegaard has tested negative for coronavirus along with his Real Madrid team-mates after the Norwegian initially tested positive on Sunday.

The news comes as a relief after recent footage emerged showing the Norwegian star shaking hands with Real Sociedad's bench before Madrid's 0-0 draw with their LaLiga counterparts on Sunday.

Both teams had mandatory coronavirus tests following the game - and just hours after Odegaard had greeted his former team-mates - and Spanish radio station Onda Cero reported the 21-year-old was the only positive test.

Having taken part in training with Odegaard on Tuesday, the whole of Zinedine Zidane's squad had to undergo a new Covid-19 test, but all the results came back on Wednesday as negative, according to El Chiringuito. 

Odegaard will therefore be available for the LaLiga champions' trip to Real Betis on Saturday and the visit of Real Valladolid four days later.  

Odeegard's latest test is the second false positive test a Real player has experienced, following Thibaut Courtois' while away with Belgium on international duty. 

Forward Mariano Diaz is therefore still the only Real player to have tested positive, having contracted the virus in July.

Norway international Odegaard spent last season on loan at Sociedad but lined up against his former team-mates in from the start in San Sebastian to make only his third appearance for Real on Sunday.

After being given the nod ahead of Casemiro, he insisted he was happy to be playing for the club again but was not satisfied that there was no winning start for Real.

 Odegaard told Spanish channel Movistar+: 'I feel good but we're missing the win.

'It doesn't leave me very happy, although it's good to play for Real Madrid again.

'It was a game against friends and good people.'

But if confirmed Odegaard will be the second positive test after striker Mariano Diaz's in July
