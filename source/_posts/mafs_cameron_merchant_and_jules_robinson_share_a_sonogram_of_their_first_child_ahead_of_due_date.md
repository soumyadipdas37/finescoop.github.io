Married At First Sight star Jules Robinson is soon to give birth to her first child with husband, Cameron Merchant. 

And it appears he is over the moon waiting for their little baby bundle. 

Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Cameron shared a photo of the sonogram of the baby while Jules was getting an ultrasound.

Cam and Jules were both seen in surgical masks while the sonogram was seen in the middle of the soon-to-be parents. 

'Coming soon to a World near you,' Cameron said, referencing his unborn child. 

'Not sure if you can see but I'm actually smiling ear to ear.' 

Cameron added a number of hashtags including 'notlongtogonow' and 'notmuchroomleft' under the photo.

Cameron and Jules, who legally married in November 2019, have chosen to keep the sex of their unborn child a secret until birth.  

The beauty told WHO magazine she doesn't feel pressure to "bounce back" to pre-baby weight soon after birth. 

'I've never felt more feminine or sexier,' she said of her pregnant frame ahead of her baby's September due date.

Jules and Cameron announced they were expecting their first child in April. 

The couple say they'd be happy with a boy or a girl, but have been drawn to pinks and florals when buying baby-related items. 

It was reported the couple recently bought a $1.8million property on Sydney's Northern Beaches.
