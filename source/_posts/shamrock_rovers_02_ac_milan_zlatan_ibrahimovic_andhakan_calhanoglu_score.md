It's the stuff of dreams for Shamrock Rovers as they face Serie A outfit AC Milan in the second round of Europa League qualifying tonight.

Shamrock are hoping to pull off what would be an absolutely incredible victory against Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Co at the Tallaght Stadium.

And Ibrahimovic and his Milan team-mates have taken to the field against the Irish minnows - whose whole squad value is dwarfed by Swedish legend Ibrahimovic.

Ahead of the match, Shamrock boss Stephen Bradley said his players are relishing the opportunity to come up against one of Europe's old elite clubs.

Bradley said: 'The bigger the game, the bigger the occasion, the better these players are.

'They've grown together as a group and in the last 12-14 months they've shown the bigger the game, the better they are. They want to perform.

'We're under no illusions how difficult it will be, but there's a stage there and I genuinely feel the players will perform.

'The pitch looks fantastic, we're playing one of the biggest clubs in the world with great players - it's time to enjoy it, perform and do what we do.'
