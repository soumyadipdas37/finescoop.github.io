She recently spoke out in defence of her Britain's Got Talent co-judge Ashley Banjo over his dance troupe Diversity's Black Lives Matter-inspired performance. 

But Amanda Holden appeared to put the ongoing controversy aside as she had a Marilyn Monroe moment while twirling into Tuesday donning a white midi dress. 

The Heart presenter, 49, flaunted her toned sun-kissed pins as she twisted in the broderie anglaise shirt dress at the Global Radio studios in central London.

Fun: Amanda Holden, 49, had a Marilyn Monroe moment while twirling into Tuesday donning a white midi dress at Global Radio studios 

The mother-of-two looked radiant as she embraced the late summer heat in the chic ensemble which flattered her figure and highlighted her bronzed limbs. 

Amanda styled her caramel tresses into a centre parting which fell in loose waves over her shoulders. 

She accentuated her glowing complexion with a dash of highlighter over her cheekbones and a touch of mascara on her fluttery eyelashes.

In keeping with her minimal look, the TV star opted for heeled nude sandals and simple studs ahead of her Heart Radio show. 

Captioning the gif to her Instagram, she penned: '#spinning into Tuesday #halo dress.'    

Her stylish post comes after she spoke about the BGT's Black Lives Matter controversy on Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan.

She said: 'It is extraordinary. I think the number of negative complaints means this conversation is right and fundamental and should continue to happen. 

'What hasn’t really been highlighted is the fact that we were inundated with overwhelming positive response, hundreds of thousands of them.

'As BGT family, and Diversity is very much part of that family, and Ashley is doing a phenomenal job on BGT, we stand by him and stand by that performance 100 per cent.'

The star added of Ashley Banjo: 'He sends out positive vibes to both the haters and the lovers of the piece that they did. He is saddened by negativity.'

Ofcom complaints have soared to 21,673 following the performance, which featured a portrayal of a policeman kneeling on Ashley Banjo's neck. 

On the show Piers reiterated his support for the routine saying: 'If you can't handle that without feeling the need to never watch BGT again or to complain to Ofcom, there's something wrong with you. 

'You, you're the problem! You're part of the problem.'

He added: 'By the way, if you don't like me saying this, then don't watch us either. Don't watch Good Morning Britain. Because I agree with Ashley Banjo and Diversity. And if you can't handle it Britain, wake up.'
