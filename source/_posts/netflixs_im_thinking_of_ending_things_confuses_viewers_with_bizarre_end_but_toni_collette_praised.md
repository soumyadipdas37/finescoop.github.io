Netflix's 'trippy' new movie I'm Thinking of Ending Things has significantly divided viewers, with many failing to make sense of the disoriented and unsettling ending.

Oscar-winning director Charlie Kaufman's film adaptation of Iain Reid's novel was released on Friday and features a stellar cast of Jessie Buckley, Jesse Plemons, David Thewlis and Toni Collette.

And while the psychological drama left viewers more confused than ever, they all agreed that Australian actress Toni, 47, deserved award season praise for her turn as the wacky and eccentric mother. 

Meet the parents... but with a twist! Netflix's 'trippy' new movie I'm Thinking of Ending Things has significantly divided viewers, with many failing to make sense of the disoriented and unsettling ending

I'm Thinking Of Ending Things features an unnerving and terrifying twist on the usual 'Meet The Parent' tropes depicted in films.

Jessie plays a woman who reluctantly agrees to meet the parents of her new boyfriend Jake [Jesse Plemons], despite not being too sure about the future of their romance.

After meeting his oddball parents [Collette and Thewlis], the woman quickly plunges into an unsettling psychological spiral as she tries hopelessly to make her way back home.

With no context given, intertwining scenes show a lonely school janitor going on about his usual work commitments.

In an attempt to tie up the movie, a dramatic ballet number is performed by a random couple before the janitor strips naked and hallucinates about a maggot-infested pig.

'The Oscar is going to Toni!' While the psychological drama left viewers more confused than ever, they all agreed that Australian actress Toni, 47, [pictured] deserved award season praise for her turn as the wacky and eccentric mother











Divisive: Some viewers couldn't believe they didn't have any answers to the movie's plot despite dedicating more than two hours to it - while others revealed they were fond on the unique movie 

The film's turn of events left viewers confused, with one asking: 'I enjoyed watching #ImThinkingOfEndingThings but did not enjoy how I gave 2 hours of my life to this and understood nothing. like.. brain empty, my dudes. I don't get it, was anything supposed to mean anything. like, was it a dream? was she dead?? was he? what??'

Another added: 'Ever watched a film the whole way through and still had no clue what it was about even after its finished? Well #ImThinkingOfEndingThings is that film! Good luck if you're going to give it a watch.'

Despite the confusion, a viewer tweeted: 'I am watching #ImThinkingOfEndingThings and had to take a mental health break and breather. One of the most visceral and engaging works I've seen in a while: Frightening, sad, relatable, maddening. Not knowing what comes next...but in a good way for a change. #netflix.'

Someone else echoed: '#ImThinkingOfEndingThings was really great it was amazingly acted beautifully cinematography it was a very interesting movie I don’t think I seen any other movie like it it was really different and I really liked it a lot :)'

One thing that everyone did agree on though was Toni's zany and offbeat performance.







'How many times must she scream to earn her Oscar?' One thing that everyone did agree on though was Toni's zany and offbeat performance

One said: 'The only good thing about #ImThinkingOfEndingThings is Toni Collette... #sorrynotsorry.'

Others added: 'How many times must Toni Collette scream to earn her Oscar' and  'Toni Collette can make something as ordinary as waving look scary.'   

'If there’s Oscars this year then Oscars are going to Toni Collette #ImThinkingOfEndingThings,' another added. 

It's believed the woman's journey to meet her boyfriend's terrifying parents in the movie I'm Thinking Of Ending Things is actually a figment of the lonely janitor's imagination.
