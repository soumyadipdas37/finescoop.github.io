Many girls dream of becoming social media influencers, but the Hembrow sisters made it their reality. 

However, Amy Hembrow has revealed that it's not always as perfect as it seems from the outside.

'I have a horror story that was with Star, because I manage her collaborations,' she began. 

'She was just starting out on Instagram and had a collaboration deal, it was her first one... in the contract it said she could not delete any of her photos.' 

Unfortunately, Amy revealed that Star 'accidentally deleted her account' and the brand demanded a 'refund for every past payment'.

'It was over a long period of time, so it was a lot of money,' she added. 

'This brand went to town and were so aggressive. We ended up paying them just to leave us alone.'

She went on to give a warning to others considering becoming an influencer, telling their listeners that 'sometimes brands will take advantage of people'.
