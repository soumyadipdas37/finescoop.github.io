A New Zealand man has filmed the moment he snowboarded through the streets after an unexpected dumping of snow.

Footage showed Tom Woodward taking his board for a ride from the driveway of his Fernhill home in Queenstown, on Monday.

Mr Woodward needed some milk and thought snowboarding to the shop would be quicker than walking.  

He continued to snowboard down the street, past parked cars that were covered in snow.

Icy particles clung to his clothes and during one patch Mr Woodward almost fell over.

Mr Woodward even has a close brush with an oncoming car attempting to brave the snow.   

'As I went down the hill I snowboarded past crashed cars and a stuck bus with police there helping them,' Mr Woodward told Daily Mail Australia.

'There was so much snow and it was so fun that I climbed up some other roads and snowboarded them too.'

Mr Woodward initially had plans to go to The Remarkables skifield, but the facility was closed due to the strong winds. 

When he saw snow up to 30cm at 8am, he knew he had to still take advantage of the show.

He made it close to town but due to warmer roads the snowfall wasn't as thick.

Severe northwest gale-force winds are expect to reach the lower North Island on Tuesday. 

Mmathapelo Makgabutlane, MetService meteorologist, said: 'Heavy Snow is likely today in the far south and remains a possibility into tomorrow for the lower South Island.

'By Tuesday, daytime temperatures in the far south just crack the mid-single digits. Gore and Invercargill see their lowest maximum temperatures since July at 3C and 4C respectively.'
