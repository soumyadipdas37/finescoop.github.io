He has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep his famous physique in shape during the coronavirus pandemic. 

And Hugh Jackman looked as fit as a fiddle as he went for a stroll with his pet pooches in New York on Monday. 

The 51-year-old showed off his muscular physique in a flimsy grey T-shirt teamed with white shorts during the outing.

Hugh's wife Deborra-lee Furness recently revealed how sehe and her husband kept occupied while in lockdown with their family during the pandemic.  

In an interview on Georgie Gardner's Drive podcast, Deborra-lee revealed the couple start each morning by reading together for half an hour.

'We read something of substance, so it sets you up for the day and we have a bit of a debate,' she said.

'We [also] do meditation, we walk the dogs, we work out and then we start our day. It gives you a structure to hold on to,' she explained.

Deborra-lee also revealed Hugh has been baking everyday during lockdown, saying: 'He's a big baker. It's his new passion. He bakes literally every day.'

Hugh and Deborra-lee share their daughter Ava, 15, and son Oscar, 20. 

Last month, Hugh also revealed being able to reconnect with his family was the one upside of the global health crisis.

'It's re-calibrated what is important,' the Wolverine star told ET Canada.

He continued: 'In many ways that has been a bonus. The silver lining has been quality time that I thought wouldn't happen again.'

The Greatest Showman star said he and his family were keeping occupied by doing puzzles together, playing games, watching movies and baking.

Hugh added that he was also able to finish watching Stranger Things, Succession and Ozark on Netflix with his 15-year-old daughter, Ava.
