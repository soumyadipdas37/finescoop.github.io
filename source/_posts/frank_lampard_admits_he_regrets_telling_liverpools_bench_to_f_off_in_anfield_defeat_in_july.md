Frank Lampard admits he regrets getting in a verbal scrap with Jurgen Klopp's coaching staff earlier this year and will put the situation to bed when Chelsea play Liverpool this season. 

The Blues boss became embroiled in an expletive war of words with the Liverpool backroom staff when his side visited Anfield on the day Liverpool lifted the Premier League title.

Lampard's side were trailing in the match when he felt that a soft free-kick had been given Liverpool's way and told Klopp's staff to 'have respect', sit down' and 'f*** off' while the Englishman also accused the group of being too arrogant after winning the league.

But the Chelsea head coach revealed on The High Performance Podcast that he is embarrassed about the incident and claims he was 'in the moment'. 

Lampard said: ‘Yeah, I did regret that. And when that broke the next day a friend of mine sent it to me in the morning, I was a bit embarrassed by it. 

‘I was in the moment, I felt we turned up and it was the easiest day for Liverpool ever. They won the league, they went goals up early in the game.

‘And a few things happened with the bench, I’m not going to go into detail, but my feeling was, I want to protect my club. And I didn’t have a problem with Liverpool celebrating. 

‘Luckily enough, I’ve been there with Chelsea where we won the league quite early one year, and you can sit there and everything feels great. My feeling was, I want to be there where they are.’

Lampard admits he does not hate any ill-feeling towards Klopp in any way as the pair prepare to lock horns again in the second match of the 2020-21 season on September 20.

The Chelsea coach also claimed he spoke to his daughters about his behaviour during the match in his attempts to 'practice what (he) preaches'.

He added: ‘ I definitely didn’t mean any disrespect to Jurgen Klopp, because I’ve got huge admiration for them. 

‘It was an impulse reaction, which I will happily – when I do see him, I’ll put that one right.

‘I care about my job, and it came out in the wrong way. And even I explained that to my daughters when I got home. And I’ll be brutally honest, it’s not the first time that they’ve heard it from me in the wrong moment. 

‘So I do try and practice what I preach, but I suppose in adult life, it doesn’t always work that way. 

‘But yeah, I was – and not just my own daughters, because you’ve got millions of Chelsea fans around the world, whether you’re young or old, it’s not the way I like to carry myself. 

‘But in talking about high level sport, you can’t take passion out of the game. And it just came out of me in one little swoop there.’
