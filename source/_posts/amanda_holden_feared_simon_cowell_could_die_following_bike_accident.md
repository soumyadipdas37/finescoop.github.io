Amanda Holden has detailed her utter dread after learning her friend Simon Cowell had broken his bake following a horrific motorbike accident.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, feared the music mogul would die after hearing the 'gut-wrenching' news and was unable to sleep after receiving the call.

The TV star said she discovered that the BGT mastermind, 60, had broken his back in August after falling off his electric motorbike in California and was terrified his injuries could be fatal.  

Oh no! Amanda Holden revealed on Saturday that she was so concerned about her pal Simon Cowell during his motorbike accident in August that she thought he was going to die

She said to The Sun: 'I honestly panicked it could be fatal. I felt physically sick as I didn’t know how bad it was.

'I wanted him to be alive, but I also wanted him to be able to walk as he’s such a good friend.' 

As Simon doesn't have a phone, Amanda got in touch with his partner, Lauren Silverman, who described what had transpired.

Their friendship spans over a decade and was cemented on TV as they joined forces and became judges on Britain's Got Talent. 

Simon's beau was spotted taking their son, Eric, six, to the beach last week while he recovered at home and she has been aiding his recovery by cooking turkey shepherd pies.

Amanda sent her co-star some Lego, books, cashmere socks and butterscotch Angel Delight as it is reportedly his favourite.

An ITV insider confirmed with The Sun that Simon will not be able to make the Britain's Got Talent finals.

'He’s obviously a massive loss but we are happy with the very talented judging panel.' 

A producer from the show has reportedly spoken to Simon and confirmed that he is doing incredibly well, despite his injuries.

While he won't be able to attend the finals in person, they revealed he might be able to make a small appearance by video link.
