She welcomed her third child - son called Huska - last Friday.

And on Tuesday, Big Brother star Krystal Hipwell (née Forscutt) was seen leaving  hospital in Cronulla, Sydney, after heading there for a hearing test for the young tot.

The 34-year-old looked effortlessly chic as she cradled her newborn son in the beachside suburb, sporting a boho-chic blue dress featuring a stunning floral pattern.

The mother-of-three shielded herself from the cool spring breeze in a thick knitted beige cardigan, and wrapped her little one up in a grey wool hat and white blanket.

She accessorised with a large brown hand bag and matching sandals, and wore round-rimmed sunglasses on her face.

The model also kept safe by wearing a face mask over her pretty visage, and appeared in high spirits as she stared down at her little one during their outing.

She had revealed on her Instagram story that the little one headed to hospital to check his ears, posting a picture of him captioned: 'Husky boy passed his hearing test!' 

Shortly after giving welcoming her baby boy with builder husband Neil Hipwell, Krystal shared details of her birthing experience - and it wasn't the easiest ride for the reality star.

Posting on Instagram on Sunday, Krystal revealed she'd undergone her third painkiller-free labour, despite suffering from internal bleeding this time around.

Krystal described what it was like to give birth to her 'big boy, who weighed 4.28kgs [9.4lbs], revealing that she suffered 'little bit of damage' due to internal bleeding.

She insisted, however: 'Every ounce of pain couldn't be more worth it for the gift in the form of this beautiful little boy.'

Krystal revealed she was expecting her third child in March, but was told by doctors to be 'cautiously optimistic' about the pregnancy.

She almost suffered a miscarriage at 13 weeks, which would have been her third if complications persisted.

She and Neil are based in Sydney's Cronulla with their family, including children, Nakoda, one, and Sunny, five.
