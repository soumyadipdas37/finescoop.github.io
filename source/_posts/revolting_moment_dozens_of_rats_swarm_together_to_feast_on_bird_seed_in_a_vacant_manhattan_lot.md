Musophobes, avert your eyes. 

Stomach-turning footage has emerged from Manhattan's Lower East Side this week, showing a massive rat gathering in a vacant lot. 

The video, shared by eyewitness Christina Martinelli to the detriment of anyone suffering from a fear of mice and rats, was recorded at around 4pm on Sunday on Hester Street.

Eyewitness Christina Martinelli, who took the revolting video, described the scene as the most rats she has ever seen in her life 

The brief-yet-impactful recording, first reported on by Gothamist, captures a teeming, chittering cluster of dozens of rodents feasting on bird seeds and stray bits of trash littering the ground behind a chain-link fence. 

On the periphery of the rat swarm, several pigeons and small birds are seen snacking on seeds.

In an email to Gothamist, which first reported on the revolting rat pack, Martinelli described the scene as 'the most rats I’ve ever seen in my life.'

Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, New York City's rat population has grown increasingly desperate and aggressive towards other animals, as well as people.  

There is a lack of available food sources for the rodent population as many restaurants remain closed and the city is emptied out, leaving less trash behind for rats to eat.

Hunger has been driving rats to take greater risks. Footage filmed in July shows rodents scurrying around diners enjoying an outdoor meal at a New York City restaurant.

One patron even claimed to be attacked by the animal, with the hungry critter nibbling in their shoe.

The stomach-turning scene played out in this location near Sara D Roosevelt Park on the Lower East Side - an area that's no stranger to rats  

Rodentologist Dr Bobby Corrigan noted that there are typically more rats out and about this time of the year because that is when young rats born in the spring leave the nest and strike out on their own to look for food before the lean winter months.

'Their lives have been upended, so they're out during the day, foraging around in a daze,' he told Gothamist of the rodents' woes caused by the pandemic. 'They're stressed from not having their normal feeding. They're disoriented and whacked out.'

He also said that the area around Sara d D Roosevelt Park, where the footage was taken on Sunday, has long been known for its high concentration of rodents.

Rat sightings across Big Apple have reportedly increased 60 per cent since city officials slashed the Department of Sanitation's budget by more than $100million three months ago.

Less than 1,000 rat sightings were reported in the city in April, but after the collection change was implemented that number ballooned to 1,650 in June.

Last month, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer complained that the current policy has created a ‘welcome mat for the rats of our city.'

'These rats have the run of New York City,’ Stringer continued about the infestation. ‘These rats are walking around waiting for a table at outdoor seating.’

He continued jokingly: ‘I’ve seen them walking upright. They come up to me and say, ‘Good morning Mr. Comptroller. They have become part of the fabric of this city because city government has failed to get trash and sanitation under control.’

Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he would restore some garbage-collection services by reallocating funds to the city's Department of Sanitation in response to growing complaints from politicians, business leaders and everyday New Yorkers fed up with the city's deteriorating conditions.
