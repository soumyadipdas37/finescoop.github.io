Princess Anne released a stunning new portrait to thank royal fans for their well-wishes on her 70th birthday. 

The princess royal, who celebrated the milestone last month, sent the photo along with a thank you note that reads: 'The Princess Royal appreciated your kind thoughts sent on the occasion of her 70th Birthday, and sends you her thanks and best wishes for the future.'

Photos of the card were shared online by royal fan accounts including The Royal Mail Box and Kat's Royal Letters.

Princess Anne released three official portraits to mark the milestone birthday and it is possible this fourth image was taken during the same photo shoot at Gatcombe Park, Gloucestershire. 

The photo shows the princess royal seated next to a window in what appears to be her country estate. 

Typically elegant, she is dressed in a peacock blue skirt suit accessorised with a gold brooch and simple gold necklace. Her brunette locks are coiffed in her signature style. 

The royal fan behind Instagram's The Royal Mail Box commented on the quality of the card and shared a photo revealing Anne's insignia was printed on the back.

Anne's other birthday photos showed the no-nonsense princess in unusually formal attire. 

Wearing a Maureen Baker evening dress, Sue Palmer bolero jacket and pearls, the Queen's only daughter looked stylish as she posed for celebrated photographer John Swannell and smiles broadly while sat in her golden leaf chair. 

Swannell has taken photographs of everyone from Diana, Princess of Wales and her sons and the Queen's official Diamond Jubilee portrait in 2012 to Tony Blair, Sir Michael Caine and Sir Elton John.

The images were taken in late February a few weeks before the coronavirus lockdown, and in the final picture Anne is dressed more causally for the outdoor setting, where she poses under a tree and looks off into the distance. It is possible the new photo was also taken then

In another picture the princess looks directly at the camera, with a hint of a smile on her lips, wearing a Sue Palmer emerald green dress and a gold ribbon knot brooch, set with 12 diamonds.

Anne's birthday plans were cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis but she still celebrated with a sailing trip around Scotland with husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence.
