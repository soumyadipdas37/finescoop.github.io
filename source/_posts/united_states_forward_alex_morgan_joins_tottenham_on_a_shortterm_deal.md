United States forward Alex Morgan has joined Tottenham on a short-term deal.  

The club announced released a statement on their club website confirming the move and said that Morgan has joined the club for the upcoming 2020-21 season from Orlando Pride.

Morgan has scored 107 goals in 169 appearances for her country and was part of the World Cup wins of 2015 and 2019.

She netted a header in the semi-finals against England at last year's tournament, memorably making a tea-drinking gesture as she celebrated. 

Morgan - who gave birth to her daughter Charlie in May - has become another among a number of high-profile names to have moved to the Women's Super League since the end of the 2019-20 season.

That has included four other United States internationals, with Manchester City having signed Sam Mewis and Rose Lavelle and Manchester United earlier this week recruiting Tobin Heath and Christen Press.
