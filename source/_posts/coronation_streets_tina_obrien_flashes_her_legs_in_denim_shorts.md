They're two of Coronation Street's best loved actors.

And Tina O'Brien and her co-star Jack P Shepherd enjoyed the balmy September temperatures as they left Media City in Salford, Manchester, on Tuesday. 

Blonde beauty Tina, 36, showed off her toned legs in a pair of denim shorts which she teamed with a black vest for the socially-distanced outing.  

Summery: Coronation Street's Tina O'Brien flashed her legs in denim shorts as she left Media City in Salford, Manchester, on Tuesday with some of her co-stars 

She teamed the casual summery outfit with white trainers and a black rucksack as she strutted her stuff and chatted with fans. 

Meanwhile Jack, 32, looked casual in a pink t-shirt and black jeans as he showed off the results of his recent hair transplant.

Ryan Prescott, 31, also made an appearance outside the studio in a blue vest and grey shorts which showed off his muscly physique.

The stars looked in high spirits as they left the building, with Ryan taking a socially-distanced selfie with one fan stood outside.

Jack's outing comes after he proudly showcased the impressive results of his hair transplant after his thinning locks put strain on his mental health.

The actor - who has played David Platt on Corrie since 2000 - underwent his first transplant last year, when he admitted that his hair loss had taken a toll on his health to the point that he almost quit the soap.

Jack visited the Crown Clinic in Manchester in January 2019 and in December of the same year to undergo the hair transplant and has now proudly flaunted the incredible results with his moved hairline and thicker volume.  

After undergoing the work, he has since shown the amazing results of his thickened thatch proving the work was very much a success.  

Last year, Jack made the surprise admission that hair loss made such an impact on his mental health that came close to giving up acting.

Wow! Jack's outing comes after he proudly showcased the impressive results of his hair transplant after his thinning locks put strain on his mental health

He wrote: '9 months it’s been since my hair transplant, I decided to get one as my hair was falling out and it was affecting my mental health to the point where I considered giving up acting and not being in the public eye. Thank you @drasimshahmalak @CrownClinicUK for everything.'

Jack had previously stated he was convinced to have a transplant after his hair loss became more noticeable on-screen.

He said at the time: 'I decided to have it done because my hair loss has really escalated in the last year, particularly at the front of my scalp. I remember seeing myself on screen and thinking: ''Oh my God, it is really falling out''.'
