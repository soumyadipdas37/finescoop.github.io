She's the Bachelor star with a taste for the finer things in life. 

And on Monday, Laura Calleri proudly showed off some designer goods as she stepped out in Perth. 

The 24-year-old, who has previously described herself as a 'snob,' clutched a $2,250 Louis Vuitton bag and flashed her bra in a sheer $344 Off-White singlet as she made her way to The Peach Pit bar.

Sheer daring! On Monday, The Bachelor's self-professed 'snob' Laura Calleri flashed her bra in a see-through designer singlet and clutched a $2,250 Louis Vuitton bag as she stepped out in Perth

Laura flashed her trim pins in a khaki miniskirt and wore a white denim jacket over her shoulders. 

She finished the look with white sandals and wore her long dark locks out and over her shoulders, neatly straightened. 

For makeup, she wore thick foundation with blush and bronzer, and a soft pink lip.

The marketing co-ordinator appeared relaxed on the outing, walking into the bar with a friend.

The reality star copped backlash from viewers after she asked Locky, 31, if he'd court her with luxury goods in the first episode.

After stepping out of the car, she introduced herself and asked him: 'When we're together, how much will you spend on my birthday present?'

But she hit back at trolls, telling The West Australian: 'In the comments (on social media) people are like: "You need a sugar daddy dating site."

'I'm like, "no, my dad just gives me money. I don't need a sugar daddy, I already have one, he is my real dad."

She also told the publication that going to Perth's prestigious private school Penrhos College prepared her for The Bachelor, because 'there's so much b**ching and carrying on at Penrhos.'
