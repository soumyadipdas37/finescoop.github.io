Barbados has announced its intention to remove the Queen as its head of state and become a republic by November, 2021.

A speech written by Prime Minister Mia Mottley quoted the Caribbean island nation's first premier Errol Barrow's warning against 'loitering on colonial premises'.

Reading the speech, Governor-General Dame Sandra Mason said: 'The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind. Barbadians want a Barbadian Head of State.

The country gained its independence from Britain in 1966, though the Queen remains its constitutional monarch. Above, Prince Charles attends a wreath laying ceremony in Bridgetown in March 2019 

'This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving.

'Hence, Barbados will take the next logical step toward full sovereignty and become a Republic by the time we celebrate our 55th Anniversary of Independence.'

In 1998, a Barbados constitutional review commission recommended republican status. Above, Queen Elizabeth ll and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visit Barbados during the Silver Jubilee year on October 30, 1977

The country gained its independence from Britain in 1966, though the Queen remains its constitutional monarch.

In 1998, a Barbados constitutional review commission recommended republican status, and in 2015 Prime Minister Freundel Stuart said 'we have to move from a monarchical system to a republican form of government in the very near future'.

Most Caribbean countries have kept formal links with the monarchy after achieving independence.

Barbados would join Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica and Guyana if it proceeds with its plan to become a republic.

Jamaica has also flagged such a transition, with Prime Minister Andrew Holness saying it is a priority of his government, but has yet to achieve it.

Barbados took another step towards independence from the UK in 2003 when it replaced the London-based Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with the Caribbean Court of Justice, located in Trinidad and Tobago's Port of Spain, as its final appeals court.

The Sugar Revolution, the introduction of sugar cane from Dutch Brazil, in the 1640s was highly lucrative but came at great social cost 

In 1627, 80 Englishmen aboard the William and John landed on the Caribbean island and founded Jamestown (close to today’s Holetown), in the name of King James I.

The early settlers struggled to develop a profitable export crop and faced difficulties in maintaining supplies from Europe.

However, the Sugar Revolution, the introduction of sugar cane from Dutch Brazil, in the 1640s was highly lucrative and over the next decade more than two thirds of English emigres to the Americas went to Barbados.

By 1650 there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared with 12,000 in Virginia and 23,000 in New England.

But while this shift to sugar yielded huge profits, it came at a great social cost thousands of West African slaves were shipped across the Atlantic to work the plantations.

Small family farms were sold and swallowed up by plantation owners and many of the white residents moved on to Jamaica and the North American enclaves, most notably North Carolina.

In the early 1640s, historians estimate there were around 37,000 whites and 6,000 blacks; by 1684 there were 20,000 whites and 46,000 blacks; and in 1834, the year slavery was abolished, there were 15,000 whites and 88,000 blacks or mixed race people.

The sale of sugar, or white gold as the colonists called it, reaped huge profits because it was a scarce commodity in European markets.

Slave laws enacted in 1936 separated society into three categories of persons, free, indentured, and enslaved, with race being a main determinant of status. 

Sugar continued as an integral part of the country's economy into the 19th century, while workers suffered from low wages and minimal social services.

By the 1930s, political unrest erupted into a labour revolt which challenged the existing order and led to the full legalisation of trade unions and the extension of the political franchise. 

Reforms in the 1940s led to the institutionalisation of mass political organisations and curtailed the power of the elite. 

Black political leaders gained ascendancy by 1944, universal adult suffrage was adopted in 1950, and full internal self-government was achieved in 1961.

Barbados became independent on November 30, 1966, during a time when the country's economy was expanding and diversifying.
