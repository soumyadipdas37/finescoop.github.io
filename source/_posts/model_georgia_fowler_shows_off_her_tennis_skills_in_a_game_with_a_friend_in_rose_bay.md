She is the Kiwi model known for strutting her stuff on the catwalk for designer labels like Balmain and Ellie Saab. 

But on Saturday, Georgia Fowler enjoyed a game of tennis with a friend in the affluent enclave of Rose Bay in Sydney.

The 28-year-old was makeup free as she showed off her trim and toned figure in a white singlet top, teamed with black leggings and trainers.

The former Victoria's Secret looked focused as she ran around the court.

She appeared pleased with herself after hitting the ball across the net, likely winning the point.

Last month, Georgia paid tribute to her beau Nathan Dalah on Instagram, sharing a series of loved-up photos of the two of them together. 

'The only thing certain about this year is you. HBD. I love you to the [moon emoji],' she wrote.

Georgia first confirmed her relationship with Nathan in February, and since then, they've made no secret of their romance.

The couple attended Paris Fashion Week together in March, before coronavirus lockdown restrictions were put in place.

They are also believed to have holidayed together in the Northern Territory earlier in the year.
