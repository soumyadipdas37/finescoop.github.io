He's among the 15 celebrities set to set to bare all for Channel Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals this month.

And on Wednesday, former Home and Away star Orpheus Pledger called for influencers to use their voice for good.

'Social media influencers should use their voices to unite,' the 27-year-old began.

United: On Wednesday, Orpheus Pledger (pictured) called on influencers to use their voice to tackle mental health issues, ahead of his turn on The All New Monty: Guys and Gals 

'And at least get the conversations started about how to combat the effects that the coronavirus is having on our lives,' he continued. 

Like many Melburnians, Orpheus has had to find different ways to entertain himself while in isolation during the city's stage-four lockdown. 

In July, he told Daily Mail Australia that he has been keeping himself distracted by making music. 

'There will be singing involved, but I've been mainly producing music,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

Good cause: On Wednesday, the Australian actor urged his followers to spread awareness of the devastating effects the coronavirus has had on mental health amid the global crisis

Distracted: Like many fellow Melburnians, Orpheus has had to find different ways to entertain himself while in isolation during the city's stage-four lockdown 

Orpheus left the role of Mason Morgan on Home and Away last year, following a number of years on the show. 

Back in July, Daily Mail Australia revealed the hunky soap star will bare all in this year's season of Seven's All-New Monty: Guys & Gals.

He will join the likes of Fat Pizza star Paul Fenech, former Biggest Loser trainer Shannan Ponton, 46, and Samuel Johnson, 42. 

 

Moving on: Orpheus fuelled rumours he was leaving Summer Bay last September, after he relocated from Sydney to Melbourne 

The All New Monty: Guys and Gals is a continuation of Seven's previous hits, The Real Full Monty and The All New Monty: Ladies Night.

Hosts Shane Jacobson, Todd McKenney and Georgie Parker have this time brought together male and female celebrities for one massive night of entertainment.

The event is designed to raise awareness for regular health checkups, including those for breast cancer, as well as prostate and testicular cancer.

The All New Monty: Guys and Gals premieres in September on Channel Seven

Get excited! Last month, it was revealed the hunky soap star will bare all in this year's season of Seven's All-New Monty: Guys & Gals - set to air on Seven soon
