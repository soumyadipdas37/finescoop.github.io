West Ham suffered an embarrassing defeat as their pre-season preparations come to an end against relegated Bournemouth at the London Stadium.

The Hammers lost 3-5 to the Cherries, who ran rampant in London as they prepare for life in the Championship this season.

Jarrod Bowen brought the home side back on level terms with a brace following a slow start as Arnaut Danjuma and Dominic Solanke scored inside the opening 17 minutes.

Drawing at the start of the second period, Sebastian Haller wasted a golden opportunity to give West Ham the lead and complete the comeback, but his volley firing over the bar came back to bite them just minutes later.

Dan Gosling put Bournemouth back in the lead after good work from Solanke and the home side failed to clear the danger.

Adam Smith and Jaidon Anthony added to the Hammers misery before Felipe Anderson scored a consolation goal with his head after a cross from Robert Snodgrass.

The defeat has added insult to injury after the club's players shared their anger over the sale of winger Grady Diangana to West Brom on Friday night.

In response to Diangana's move to their Premier League rivals, West Ham captain Mark Noble tweeted: 'As captain of this football club I'm gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!!' 

Declan Rice 'liked' Noble's tweet in a show of support from the Chelsea target, whilst Jack Wilshere had a sly dig at the club hierachy for the decision.

On a post that the 22-year-old posted thanking West Ham for his time with the club, the former Arsenal man did not hold back as he commented: 'Go and do your thing in a club that respects you. big player with a big future.'
