Bruno Fernandes has responded to Jose Mourinho's dig at his penalty record by comparing himself to Kevin De Bruyne.

The Tottenham manager took a swipe at Fernandes as well as United regarding the amount of spot-kicks Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side were awarded last season.

'Bruno came in, he was fit, played very well and improved the United team,' he told Portuguese newspaper Record.

'He also proved to be a great penalty taker, one of the best in the world, because he had about 20 to score!'. 

Fernandes made an instant impact following his £68million January move from Sporting Lisbon, scoring 12 goals and providing eight assists in 22 matches.

Out of those 12 goals, eight came from the penalty spot but Fernandes defended himself and said Mourinho's jibe about him being 'a great penalty taker, because he had about 20 to score' is a 'reality'.

'I honestly did not feel stung,' Fernandes told A Bola.

'I feel that I am a good penalty taker and nothing more, I understand, but what I take from his [Mourinho's] words, because I'm a very positive person, is that he said I hit penalties well.

'It is a reality, not least since I arrived at Manchester United.'

Following the arrival of Fernandes United's form improved and he helped them seal a Champions League spot in the Premier League after being off the pace earlier in the 2019-20 campaign.

Fernandes has defended himself by comparing his influence on games to Kevin De Bruyne

The 25-year-old pointed out his influence on games during the second half of the season, comparing himself to Manchester City maestro De Bruyne.

'I hear people saying, "ah, he only scores from penalty kicks"… but a little while ago, I saw the statistics and, except for penalties, only Kevin De Bruyne has a higher involvement in goals than me in England when it comes to midfielders,' he added.

Last season United were awarded a record 14 penalties in the Premier League. Mourinho was on the receiving end of two penalty decisions when United drew 1-1 with Spurs.

The first saw Paul Pogba dragged back by Eric Dier before United were awarded a second penalty in injury time, although VAR overturned that decision.

'The second one was incredible for me,' Mourinho said after the game.

'If VAR goes for simulation, the players could be exposed and given a yellow card. Fernandes comes from a country that I know well.' 

It's not the first time Mourinho has jibed at United's penalty record. In July, when asked to compare United's attack with Tottenham's, the Spurs boss said: 'United's 13 penalties is a help. It's a help!'
