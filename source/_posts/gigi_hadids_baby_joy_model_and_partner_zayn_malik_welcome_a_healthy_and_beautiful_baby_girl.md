Precious: Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have welcomed their first child, a baby girl 

Expecting the best! The couple's baby news first emerged back in April from a 'family' source 

Word Gigi and Zayn were expecting first emerged in April after a 'family source' spilled the beans about the IMG beauty and her on/off boyfriend of five years.  

Shortly after she confirmed the news herself. 

Gigi said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. 

'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.' 

An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month that the couple had been getting along great ahead of the birth of their baby.

'[They are] closer than ever. Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn,' the source revealed. 'She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.'

And it seems their incoming bundle of joy will be just the start for the young family.

Back in May People said the celebrity couple 'plan to have a large family.'

'They've been through their ups and downs, but neither stopped caring about the other.'

Of expanding their brood, they went on: 'They've jumped on the timing of having a baby and are preparing for their new lives.

'Gigi is young but always said she wants several kids. She's sensitive and nurturing and will be a great mom.' 

Hadid and Malik's relationship has not always been perfect.

The duo began dating in in November 2015, three months after the musician called off his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards. 

But after just over two years together, the couple confirmed their break-up on Twitter in March 2018.

The pair reconciled in December of 2019 after a year long split, during which time Gigi briefly dated former Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron.
