Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson and Laura Byrne announced earlier this week that they're expecting their second child together. 

And on Saturday, Laura, 31, showed off her burgeoning baby bump in a bikini as she went for a swim at the beach. 

The jewellery designer shared a picture of herself on Instagram in her leopard print two-piece, as she played with her daughter Marlie-Mae, one, in Byron Bay.
