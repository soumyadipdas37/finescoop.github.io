Karren Brady has claimed raising children is harder than going to work and said women in business have a tough time because they're 'picked apart and commented on' in a way men aren't. 

Baroness Brady, 51, who became the managing director of Birmingham Football Club at the tender age of 23 and has gone on to become an aide to Lord Alan Sugar on The Apprentice, made the comments on ITV show Loose Women on Monday.  

Speaking in a discussion with presenters Carol McGiffin, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore and Brenda Edwards, Karren said: 'Having a family and bringing up children is actually much harder - and I know because I've done both - than going to work.'

Karren, who has daughter Sophia, 23, and son Paolo with her Canadian footballer husband Paul Peschisolido, 48,  detailed how a mother is a 'chef', 'entertainments manager' and 'taxi driver' and is often 'very unappreciated'. 

Earlier in the conversation, the businesswoman had said that while it is a 'positive thing' that attitudes to women have changed, they do 'have it difficult' in the workplace.

On the subject of having children, Karren, who is also the vice-chairman of West Ham United football club, blasted the notion that going on maternity leave to spend time with little ones counts as a 'year off.' 

'There is no such thing as the year off. It is exhausting, you're the entertainments manager, you're the chef, the taxi driver,' she aid.

'You're doing everything in your power, often very unappreciated, but there you are providing all the support.

'And some people are trying to work. And actually statutory maternity pay is not really enough to see you through that period.'

She said that mothers have no choice but to take maternity pay unless they have 'very understanding grandparents or a lot of money to afford childcare.'

Mothers who want to return to business then have to 'try and pick the pieces up when you go back to your career,' she added.

Earlier, Karren spoke of the time she was turned down for a job in a supermarket because she was told she was 'too glamorous' and went on to explain why she thinks women have a difficult time in the work place. 

She said: 'To be fair, I did turn up in white cowboy boots.

'Attitudes to women have changed and opportunities for women have changed and that’s the positive thing. We do have it difficult, us women. 

'All the small parts of ourselves are picked apart and commented on,' she added.   

Karren had first broached the subject of business when she was asked about the upcoming BBC show The Apprentice, Best Bits, which is set to air on Thursday. 

It has been made to replace the normal annual series, which was cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Karen detailed how a mother is a 'chef', 'entertainments manager' and 'taxi driver' and is often 'very unappreciated'. She was speaking in a discussion with presenters Carol McGiffin, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore and Brenda Edwards

Earlier in the conversation, the businesswoman had said that while it is a 'positive thing' that attitudes to women have changed, they do 'have it difficult' in the workplace

She said it features '15 years of incredible moments.'

'It's so funny. We comment on it, it's hysterical. You laugh, you cringe, some of the things they do are incredible, some incredibly stupid. 

'There are some incredible moments that have been created over the past 15 years.'  

In 2018 the millionaire businesswoman admitted on Loose Women that despite missing out on many things in her children's upbringing, she has continued to be a good role model for them. 

She said: 'I love my children, I love my work, I've tried to make it work. 

'I haven't always got it right but I've done my very best and actually that's all you can do as a working mum.'
