Bella Thorne has been keeping busy with her controversial OnlyFans account, where she recently dropped her new single.

But the former Disney Channel star is also enjoying some quality romantic time with boyfriend Benjamin Mascolo.

She lived her goth girl fantasy Tuesday in a strapless black leather corset with sheer cutouts over her taut midriff, as she grabbed dinner with the Italian artist in West Hollywood.

The 22-year-old paired the top with a matching black ruffled mini skirt, which showed off her toned legs in a pair of black leather platform combat boots.

She finished the ensemble with a black 'vote' face mask, a chunky pearl Chanel choker, a matching handbag, a white belt with a gold buckle and diamond bling on her wrists and fingers.

Bella held hands with Benjamin, 27, who sported an equally pink look, as they arrived at the celeb favorite hotspot Craig's.

She previously took to her Instagram Story to show off a bouquet of roses he bought her, writing: 'My boyfriend is perfect perfect perfect.'

The Shake It Up actress gushed to her 23.8million followers: 'Come on. I mean... Come on, my boyfriend, number one stunner. Come on! I mean, just gorgeous. Gorgeous!'

She also took to her profile with a behind-the-scenes photo from her Stupid F***ing B**** music video, showing her in a white bikini and matching pearls, looking into a poolside monitor. 

Bella teased the video for her new single the night before on Instagram, writing: 'STUPID F***ING B**** just about to drop this on my ONLY fans !!! Link in bio BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND SEE' 

She launched her OnlyFans last month, charging $20 a month, $51 for a three-month subscription or $102 for six months.  

The Assassination Nation actress was reportedly the first content creator on the platform to earn $1million in their first 24 hours, after briefly crashing the site.  

She told the Los Angeles Times that she made $2million in the first week, and she's 'putting the earnings into her production company and toward charity.'

Although the site is mostly for adult entertainers to monetize their work, Thorne tweeted: 'Also nooooo I’m not doing nudity!!!'

But she quickly stirred up controversy, when she charged $200 for nude photos, which weren't actually nude, prompting many users to complain and request refunds.

The site subsequently implemented some unwelcome changes, like capping payments at $50 for pay-per-view posts, as well as a hold that would require some international users to wait 30 days for their payout.

Many sex workers who rely on the platform for their livelihood blamed Bella for making their jobs more difficult.

She later apologized on Twitter, writing: 'I wanted to bring attention to the site, the more people on the site the more likely of a chance to normalize the stigmas, And in trying to do this I hurt you.

'I have risked my career a few times to remove the stigma behind sex work, porn, and the natural hatred people spew behind anything sex related.' 

She added: 'I am a mainstream face and when you have a voice, a platform, you try to use you in helping others and advocate for something bigger than yourself. Again in this process I hurt you and for that I’m truly sorry.' 

A spokesperson for OnlyFans clarified to BBC: 'Spending limits are in place to protect all OnlyFans users and to allow them to use the platform safely. 

'The newly introduced limits on tips and paid posts is a change that has been in the pipeline for a while, and has not been implemented in response to any one creator or fan.'

Bella told Paper of her reasons for joining the site: 'OnlyFans is the first platform where I can fully control my image; without censorship, without judgement, and without being bullied online for being me.'

She also retweeted a journalist who claimed she joined as research for an upcoming project with director Sean Baker.

The Florida Project director subsequently posted a statement, revealing that the film would be in the 'far future' and nothing was concrete.

He wrote: 'I advised her team to consult with sex workers and address the way she went about this so as NOT to hurt the sex work industry. This has been the extent of my involvement.'

Bella posted the screenshots and a note to Twitter: 'F*** u and the power u think you have over me. I'm gonna write about this in my next book. Here's the photos he's been threatening me with, in other words here's my boobies.'
