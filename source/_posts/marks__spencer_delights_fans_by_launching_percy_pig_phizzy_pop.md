'Add a bit of alcohol and I think we've got a Percy Pig cocktail,' added a third. 

It comes as fans across the country rejoiced as their first shops from Marks and Spencer arrived as the company joined forces with Ocado.

As part of its tie-up with the online grocer, it put 6,000 of its products online, including replacements for the 4,000 Waitrose products previously available through the online supermarket.

Earlier this year Londoner Gemma Keen went viral after sharing her delicious Percy Pig cocktail recipe, paying homage to the popular Marks and Spencer sweet. 

The recipe only takes four ingredients to make and can easily be recreated at home with Percy Pig ice cream and Tequila Rose. 

In April, Marks & Spencer launched Percy Pig ice-cream, which also has the unmistakable raspberry and grape flavour of the popular sweets with a ripple of signature fruity sauce running through, as well as strawberry marshmallows.

The easy to make cocktail requires four main ingredients: Percy Pig Ice-cream, milk, tequila rose and an optional shot of vodka if you like it strong
