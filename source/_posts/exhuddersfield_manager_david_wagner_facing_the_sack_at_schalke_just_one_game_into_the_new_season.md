Schalke head coach David Wagner faces the sack after just one game of the 2020-21 campaign, with the charismatic German reportedly told he will lose his job if the club lose again.

Former Huddersfield boss Wagner took over at the Bundesliga club last year after enjoying a four-year spell with the Terriers, but the 48-year-old set a new club record last season when Schalke went 16 league games without a win.

And their poor form continued into the new campaign, as Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich served up an 8-0 hammering of Wagner's side at the Allianz Arena.

The latest defeat increases the pressure on Wagner, and German outlet Bild reports that Wagner has been warned ahead of the side's next league game against Werder Bremen.

If Schalke lose their game on Saturday, Wagner will be dismissed from his post at Veltins-Arena. 

The same report suggests that Schalke's sporting director Jochen Schneider has been told to contact possible replacements for the 48-year-old, with former Mainz boss Sandro Schwarz a front runner to take over as boss.

Wagner's side performed well below expectations last season, with the slump in form in the second half of the campaign resulting in Schalke finishing in 12th, just nine points above the drop zone. 

'We didn’t perform well as a group and Bayern were in great shape. We need to shake this off now,' Wagner said after the humiliating defeat.

'We have to show a reaction against Werder – we expect that from ourselves. I have confidence in my team’s qualities, which we unfortunately couldn’t show today.'
