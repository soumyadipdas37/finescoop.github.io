They've revealed they both found the man of their dreams on The Bachelorette, which is set to premiere next week. 

And it seems that love was well and truly in the air when Elly Miles and sister Becky went on a double date with two hunky suitors during filming last month. 

The pair enjoyed a romantic day on the water in Sydney's Rose Bay with two contestants, and at one point Elly was seen sharing a kiss with her man.

The girls cut casual figures on the day, with Elly, 25, wearing a pair of white high-waisted short teamed with a brown singlet and a checkered blazer and sneakers. 

Meanwhile, Becky, 30, opted for a long sleeve black top, which she matched with a layered floral miniskirt. 

The siblings looked glam, wearing full makeup and and their blonde locks out and over their shoulders.

Elly revealed there were no issues of jealousy or liking the same guy because of their different taste in men.

'We clicked with who we clicked with, and they were completely different,' the younger Miles sister explained. 

The former Bachelor contestant's happily ever this season comes after she found herself being sent home by Matt Agnew last year - despite being a fan favourite.
