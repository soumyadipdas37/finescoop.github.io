Diego Simeone has reportedly made contact with Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira, with Atletico Madrid interested in bringing the 24-year-old to the club on a loan deal. 

Torreira's future at the Emirates Stadium is uncertain, with new boss Mikel Arteta looking to strengthen his midfield before the transfer window closes. Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar have been heavily linked with a move.

As such, the Gunners are open to letting the Uruguayan midfielder leave, and the former Sampdoria midfielder has been linked with a return to Italy, with Fiorentina and Torino interested.

And according to AS, Atletico are also interested in Torreira and have opened talks with Arsenal over a move for the 24-year-old. 

The Spanish outlet reports that Atletico are initially looking to seal a loan deal for Torreira, while boss Simeone has personally contacted the Arsenal man in a bid to convince him to move to Spain.

Torreira has fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal under Arteta, and has not featured in the Spaniard's matchday squad for either of the club's first two Premier League fixtures.

Meanwhile, the Gunners are interested in signing Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey

The 24-year-old made 39 appearances for the Gunners last season, scoring two goals and providing one assist.  

Arsenal have reportedly already offered Alexander Lacazette and Matteo Guendouzi to Atletico as a sweetener to acquire Partey from Simeone's side. 

However, Atletico have rejected Arsenal's approaches and are demanding £45.5m for the midfielder.
