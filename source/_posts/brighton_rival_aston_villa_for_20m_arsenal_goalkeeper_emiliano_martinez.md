Aston Villa's hopes of signing Emiliano Martinez have been threatened by rival interest from Brighton and Hove Albion.

Martinez has been pulled from Arsenal's squad to face Fulham with Bernd Leno to start.

Arsenal want £20million for the Argentine and it is understood he is still owed a seven figure bonus as part of his contract before he leaves.

Villa's offer is understood to be £15m plus £4m in add ons.

Martinez, who turned 28 earlier this month, is eager to play regularly and wasn't guaranteed to do so at Arsenal.

Towards the end of last season Martinez made a significant impact for Arsenal while Leno was out injured.

Martinez helped Arsenal to win the FA Cup and made 23 appearances - the most of any season in his career. 

During his ten years at Arsenal Martinez has been sent out on loan on six occasions.
