Gwyneth Paltrow and her producer husband Brad Falchuk have enjoyed almost two years of wedded bliss. 

And the Hollywood power couple, who each have homes in Los Angeles and in New York, have been spending a lot of their quarantine at Gwyneth's Hamptons property.

On Saturday, the veteran actress, 47, was spotted taking her beloved husband Brad, 49, to the East Hampton airport in a red jeep as he left to catch a flight.

Gwyneth bid her mate farewell with a sweet kiss in the front seat of their red jeep before Brad left. 

Though the Goop founder was barely visible she clung onto her husband who was dressed down in a white t-shirt, black sweatpants and distressed brown boots. 

Just last summer, Gwyneth caused a stir when she admitted to The Sunday Times that the couple - though married - were not living together. The pair typically spend four days a week cohabitating with Brad returning to his Los Angeles property for the rest of the week. 

'All my married friends say that the way we live sounds ideal and we shouldn’t change a thing' the blonde beauty said.

The couple both have sets of kids with their exes. Gwyneth shares Apple, 16, and Moses, 14, with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and Brad has Isabella and Brody with his ex-wife Suzanne Falchuk. 

It appears as if the blended family of six has been quarantining together as Gwyneth revealed in a Goop video that 'It’s pretty close quarters.' 

The pair seemed to have been splitting time between the east and the west coast with Brad likely heading back home to Los Angeles as Hollywood productions slowly start to open up safely amid COVID restrictions.  

Most recently the producer and writer created a part for his wife in the Netflix smash hit The Politician.

Co-created with his right hand man Ryan Murphy, Falchuk wrote the role of Georgina Hobart for Paltrow, a Montecito mom to protagonist Ben Platt's character Payton. 

Speaking about her husband's persistence to get her to play the part he had written, Paltrow revealed that she originally said 'no.' 

The actress who has recently pulled back from Hollywood amid her success from her lifestyle brand Goop, told her persistent husband that there was 'no way she could do it.'

In an interview with Elle magazine, Falchuk added, 'She’d show me a giant chunk of her dialogue and be like, ‘I have a [Goop] board meeting in two days. Please don’t make me do this' he said. 

Production eventually agreed to work around her schedule and the Hollywood power couple were back on set together for the first time since they met on the set of Glee in 2014. Gwyneth had a recurring role in the show  and Falchuk co-created the show with Murphy. 

Since her hiatus from acting, Gwyneth's lifestyle company Goop has exploded. The company was valued at $250 million in 2018 and seems to only be getting bigger. 

She first launched the company as a newsletter in 2008 and now the brand is a full lifestyle website with skincare products and wellness tips among other things.
