Students at the elite Shore School have mocked battling western Sydney suburbs as being full of 'druggos' in a viral video - after they were caught planning vile Muck Up day antics and boasting about their exclusive facilities. 

The TikTok video shows students from the $33,000-a-year school on Sydney's north shore being interviewed by popular account Fonzie Gomez, who asks the boys in their trademark boater hats and uniforms to to name the 'worst' suburbs in Sydney.

All the students name suburbs in Sydney's western, including Blacktown and Mount Druitt as they prepare to board the train at North Sydney station.

The latest video comes after students were slammed for bragging about their lavish facilities, including a '$50 mill[ion] gym' and library with Sydney Harbour views in an earlier TikTok clip. 

Then on Tuesday, a document that circulated among Year 12 students detailing their plans for muck-up day was leaked to the public. 

The 'pranks' included spitting on homeless men and taking drugs.

Students at the $33,000-a-year Shore School have slammed other suburbs for being full of 'druggos' in a viral TikTok video (pictured), in the latest scandal to rock the elite college

In the now deleted TikTok interview, a group of four Shore School students were told to name the worst suburb in Sydney. 

'Blacktown,' the four boys answer in unison.

When asked to elaborate one said 'because its Blacktown', before another answered 'druggos'.

Another pair of mates were asked the same question, with one replying: 'The worst is Bankstown... too many 'eshays' who'll roll you'.

An eshay refers to a Sydney subculture of young criminals who tend to wear bumbags and sneakers, and are usually considered to be from battler suburbs.

The exception among the group was one boy who said the worst suburb 'is Mosman because all the rich kids live there'.

The TikTok comes the day after a document detailing plans for a crime-spree among Year 12 students on Muck up Day was revealed.

Plans for a scavenger hunt, titled the 'Triwizard Shorenament' in a reference to Harry Potter, encourages students to take drugs, assault strangers and trespass on private property.  

The 'rule book' - detailed by students in a PDF documents - reveals plans to meet at a park on the lower north shore on the night before the traditional celebrations.

Year 12 students would be split into teams of five or six before carrying out a series of tasks to gain the most points.

It comes after a shocking document detailing plans for a crime-spree among Year 12 students on Muck up Day was revealed, with students planning to spit on homeless men as part of the 'Triwizard Shorenament' (Pictured is the front page of the document sent between students)

The school is among the top ranked in New South Wales and regularly features impressive Year 12 results 

Founded in 1889, the school overlooks Sydney Harbour (pictured) and features a distinguished list of ex-students including a Prime Minister 

Some challenges are illegal, such as 'snort a line' (of cocaine) or 'rip a cone on the Harbour Bridge' (smoke cannabis out of a bong).

Others dare students to 'break into Taronga Zoo', 'spit on a homeless man', and 'sh** on a train'.

Some involve assaulting total strangers by hitting them in the genitals while they are walking past.

The list of challenges also denigrates women, urging students to have sex with a woman over 80kg or hook up with an unattractive women deemed '3/10 or lower'. 

Others tasks are more family friendly, including getting mullet haircuts and waxing armpit hair.  

Instructions written into the rule book advise students they must document their completed tasks on Instagram.

But they are also warned not to upload any potentially incriminating evidence of illegal behaviour including 'inappropriate or sexual advances'.

'If anyone gets caught by a teacher/cops they will say that they were just having fun between the 5/6 of them and won't mention the tournament,' the instructions state.

Before starting on the challenges, the groups first have to finish a case of 30 beers in 15 minutes.

The game was discovered by school administrators, who contacted New South Wales Police.

A spokesman for Shore school - which charges up to $33,000-a-year in fees, told the Sydney Morning Herald it had issued a stern warning to students and parents over the game.

'As soon as the school became aware of the document police were informed and an urgent communication was sent to all year 12 parents instructing that under no circumstances are Shore boys to participate in the activities specified,' the spokesman said. 

'Consequences for any boys who do participate will be severe and could include the loss of their place at the school.'

A spokesperson for New South Wales Police told Daily Mail Australia they respect the age old tradition of muck-up day but will not tolerate any illegal behaviour. 

Established in 1889, Shore School features state-of-the art facilities and an incredible view over Sydney Harbour.

It is regularly ranked among the highest schools in the state for its Year 12 results and has produced a Prime Minister, a High Court Judge and several sporting champions.

'We believe the best evidence of success will be exhibited in the adult lives of those who have passed through the School. 

'We are proud of our many Old Boys who have served in all walks of life with great dedication.'
