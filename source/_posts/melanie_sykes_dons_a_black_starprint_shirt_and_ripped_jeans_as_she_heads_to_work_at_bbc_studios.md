She recently hit out at Keith Lemon when she branded men 'basic and limited' during a rant about her love life.

And Melanie Sykes put the drama behind her as she put on a cheerful display while heading to work at the BBC Radio 2 Studios in London on Saturday.

The presenter, 50, cut a casual figure in a black star print shirt and ripped blue jeans as she strolled in the sunshine.

Melanie highlighted her trim physique by cinching in her waist with a black leather belt with a gold buckle.

While she accessorised her work look with a large tan tote bag and simple black sandals.

The beauty swept her raven tresses into a smart ponytail, while she completed her look with trendy brown tinted shades.

Melanie appeared in great spirits as she flashed a huge smile as she walked.

The outing comes after Mel recently hit out at Keith Lemon as she branded men 'basic and limited' during a rant about her love life.

Earlier this month, the presenter said she felt 'sorry' for British men as she let rip at the ITV2 star during an interview for her own Frank magazine.

'Sadly, in all realms of life, most men are pretty basic and disappointing,' she said.

'I feel a bit sorry for British men who have adopted the limited vocabulary of the television character Keith Lemon when talking about and to women.

'I would be surprised, and indeed it would be a miracle, if any of these men are actually getting laid', the TV personality added.  

Mel has previously appeared on Celebrity Juice where comedian Leigh Francis takes on the persona of host Keith. 

In light of her comments, Keith told The Sun he contacted the TV personality, who said she was merely referencing the persona he portrays on screen. 

Keith, who is the alter ego of Leigh Francis, said: 'I reached out to her and asked why she didn’t like me. She said, "It’s not you, it’s your on-screen persona".

The star then noted some of his career achievements over the years as he defended himself.

He said: 'Well if anyone’s watching and you have a limited vocabulary, you can still win two Baftas and two NTAs. I don’t want to boast about all the things I’ve won.' 

Elsewhere, Mel was previously married to Daniel Caltagirone between 2001 and 2009 and the couple share two sons Roman and Valentino.

Her second marriage to Jack Cockings ended in 2016 and she has since enjoyed romances with the likes of Jamie Theakston, Martin Kaymer, Olly Murs and Steve Coogan.
