Sophie Turner stepped out with her husband Joe Jonas on a sunny stroll for the first time since giving birth to their daughter, Willa, on July 22.  

The first-time parents, who welcomed their little girl less than two months after their first wedding anniversary, affectionately held hands around their neighborhood in LA on Saturday.

As they walked briskly, the 24-year-old Game of Thrones star showcased her slender post-pregnancy physique in striped top, which she tucked into a pair of white jeans.

Her figure-hugging bottoms clung to ever curve of her toned frame and taut midriff, as she strutted next to the singer in her grey and white Nike sneakers. 

She paired her look with a chic pair of yellow tinted sunglasses and kept her nose and mouth covered under a black CDC-recommended face mask.  

The two-time Grammy nominee appeared protective of Turner, as he closely flanked her side on their solo outing. 

Despite the soaring California heat, Jonas opted to wear a chic black sweater and matching shorts.
