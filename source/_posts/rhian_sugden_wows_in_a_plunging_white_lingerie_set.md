She is known for flaunting her enviable curves. 

And Rhian Sugden looked sensational as she posed in a plunging white lingerie set to celebrate the brand, PrettyLittleThing, stocking her self-tan range on Monday. 

The former glamour model, 33, displayed her svelte sun-kissed physique as she described how she was 'still buzzing' that the retailer sells her natural tanning lotion.

Rhian showcased her model credentials on Instagram as she posed alongside rose gold balloons branded with the name of her self-tan 'Clarity by Rhian Sugden'. 

With her blonde bob styled in loose waves, Rhian looked every inch the natural beauty as she pouted for the camera. 

The influencer pulled her white thong high on her hips to accentuate her incredible hourglass curves in the Instagram post.

Keeping all eyes on her figure, Rhian opted for minimal makeup and added a dash of bronzer over her cheekbones with a slick of nude lipstick. 

Captioning the snap, she penned: 'Still BUZZING that @claritybyrhian is now stocked on @plthq.

'If you’re a product conscious guy/gal Clarity is the one for you. It’s got all the nasties stripped out of it.'

She continued: 'Paraben free, vegan friendly and it give a beautiful medium glow. No orange smudges in sight! 

'It also goes on clear meaning you don’t have to stay in during the developing stage.'

Earlier this month Rhian revealed she put on a half a stone during lockdown but is embracing her new curves.

She wowed in a floral sports bra as she talked about her changing body with her 438,000 Instagram followers.

The social media star admitted the extra time at home has made her put on a few extra pounds but she has taken the first step to getting fit by putting on some chic activewear.

She wrote: 'Has anyone else packed on a few pounds in lockdown? I’ve put on over half a stone and can’t for the life of me get motivated to go to the gym.   

'But putting my gym gear on is a step in the right direction right?

'I wish I was one of those people that enjoys working out and running etc... I just like eating and laying down too much.'

Rhian recently revealed that she's desperate to have her bust size reduced, 14 years after they helped propel her to stardom and kick off her £800,000 career. 

The beauty shot to fame as a Page three model back in 2006 at the age of 19, earning herself legions of fans and going on to secure a plethora of deals, including £100,000 for appearing on the 2012 instalment of Celebrity Big Brother.

But the star, who retired from topless modelling on turning 30, has now revealed that she's eager to reduce the size of her ample assets, and get implants to give her 32G chest a lift in defiance of gravity's inevitable pull. 

She told The Sun: 'I've always been a D/E cup but since getting married I've put on a little bit of weight and it's my boobs that grow and nowhere else. Now they're a 32G, a bit out of control and gravity has taken its toll.

'I'd give anything for a C cup. If someone said to me tomorrow, 'Shall we cut them off?' I'd say 'Yeah!''

Looking back on her experience with topless modelling, she added: 'It lasted 12 years. I was part of the elite glamour girls and my boobs landed me £100K for Celebrity Big Brother in 2012.'

Rhian said she isn't sure about the exact amount she has earned as a glamour model but believes it's above £500,000.
