Thomas Cook is to rise from the ashes of the coronavirus crisis as a Chinese-owned online holiday business.

While the sector has been ravaged by travel bans, the company founded 178 years ago has been bought by the Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group following its collapse last September.

It has been licensed by the Civil Aviation Authority and carries Atol protection for the holidays it will sell via the Thomas Cook website.

Thomas Cook, which was founded 178 years ago, has been bought by the Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group following its collapse last September

Initially, it will sell holidays to beach destinations and cities in countries including Italy, Greece and Turkey, that are not covered by travel controls or a need for people to quarantine on return. 

Customers will be able to choose from room-only to all-inclusive options. A family of four can stay for a week outside Bodrum in October for £1,250, flying from Liverpool.

Thomas Cook UK's chief executive, Alan French, said: 'We have reinvented one of the most recognisable names in British travel.

'We know Brits are keen to travel but feel nervous about safety and changes to Government rules on quarantine.

We are only selling destinations on the travel corridor list and all hotels are flexible.

We also won't charge customers a fee to swap their holidays if rules change.'

Jim Qian, chairman and chief executive of Fosun, which also owns Club Med, said: 'Supporting the growth of the brand in China and its relaunch in the UK is a big step in our plan to turn Thomas Cook into a global success story.'

The editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, was cautious, saying: 'While some previous Thomas Cook customers may be pleased to see it relaunching, the events of the past few months should act as a reminder that just because a brand is a household name does not mean you can rely on it to treat you fairly.'
