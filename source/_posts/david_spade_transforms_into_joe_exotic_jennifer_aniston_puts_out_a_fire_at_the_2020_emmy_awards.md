Hollywood honored the latest and greatest in TV by orchestrating a first of its kind socially-distanced Primetime Emmy Award ceremony on Sunday evening.

And aside from career milestones and emotional acceptance speeches, the two-and-a-half hour show included a slew of hilarious, share-worthy moments.

From David Spade transforming into Tiger King star Joe Exotic to Jennifer Aniston putting out a LITERAL fire on stage, the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards had something for everyone. 

Hilarity: From David Spade transforming into Tiger King star Joe Exotic to Jennifer Aniston putting out a LITERAL fire on stage, the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards had something for everyone

Aniston to the rescue! While handing out the evening's first award with host Jimmy Kimmel, Jennifer Aniston showcased her firefighting skills

In a segment that gave viewers a comedic look at the lockdown lives of celebrities, Spade put on his best Southern drawl and a bleach blonde wig to impersonate the former zoo operator.

'I've been in prison,' began Spade, who sat before a cellblock backdrop and had on a bright orange prison jumpsuit. 'Cause of Carole f**king Baskin, you b**ch!' 

Spade was referencing to Exotic's 22-year prison sentence, which resulted from a failed murder-for-hire plot against rival Big Cat enthusiast Carole Baskin. 

Joe Exotic - born Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage - rose to fame earlier this year, following the release of the out of this world Netflix documentary series Tiger King.  

Crisis averted: As the flames reflected in Kimmel's eyes, Aniston sprung into action, grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher, and expertly put it out - all while wearing a floor-length gown

Girl gang: Later in the show, Jennifer reunited with her Friends co-stars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow for a short bit about how they planned to continue viewing the rest of the socially-distanced show, together

Jennifer Aniston is known for her glamorous red carpet moments and her iconic film and television characters.

But while handing out the evening's first award with host Jimmy Kimmel, the 51-year-old Friends star showcased her firefighting skills.

Kimmel was 'disinfecting' the winner's envelope with a slew of flammable disinfectants, which eventually led to him just setting the entire envelope on fire and throwing it into a dumpster.

As the flames reflected in Kimmel's eyes, Aniston sprung into action, grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher, and expertly put it out - all while wearing a floor-length gown.

Unlikely duo: Randall Park took to the stage to present the award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series or Movie with an unlikely co-presenter

Better safe than sorry: 'I learned that the covid transmission rate between humans and alpacas is very low,' began 46-year-old Fresh Off the Boat actor as an adorable alpaca resided next to him

Later in the show, Jennifer reunited with her Friends co-stars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow for a short bit about how they planned to continue viewing the rest of the socially-distanced show, together.

'We've been roommates since 1994, Jimmy!' joked Aniston, before scurrying off with Cox and Kudrow to grab some dinner. 'We'll be watching! Dinner's ready, we're DVRing it!' they shouted.

Randall Park took to the stage to present the award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series or Movie with an unlikely co-presenter.

'I learned that the covid transmission rate between humans and alpacas is very low,' began 46-year-old Fresh Off the Boat actor as an adorable alpaca resided next to him.

The Pand-Emmys: As he made his way through the evening, Jimmy Kimmel referred to the Emmy's as 'The Pand-Emmys' and even the 'No People's Choice Awards' due to the empty stadium

Poking fun: In tune with most hosting gigs, Kimmel indulged in a slew of side bits, including one with Anthony Carrigan that parodied the current mail-in hysteria

'I also learned that when you read an email too quickly, the phrase, 'You're presenting with an alpaca' looks a lot like the phrase, 'You're presenting with Al Pacino,'' joked Park before listing the category's nominees. 

Jimmy Kimmel took a break from his evening talk show to host the award ceremony on Sunday evening at the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles.

And the 52-year-old comedian, with no live-audience to judge him, put his entire joke arsenal on display for those tuning in at home.

As he made his way through the evening, Kimmel referred to the Emmy's as 'The Pand-Emmys' and even the 'No People's Choice Awards' due to the empty stadium. 

Making it work: With no living bodies able to fill the seats at Staples Center on Sunday, the Emmy's production crew placed cardboard cut-outs of the nominees in the first few rows

Wait a minute: But Jimmy quickly recognized that out of these 'cardboard cut-outs' was actually a living and breathing Jason Bateman

In tune with most hosting gigs, Kimmel indulged in a slew of side bits, including one with Anthony Carrigan that parodied the current mail-in hysteria.

Carrigan, who notoriously portrayed Chechen mobster NoHo Hank in the HBO series Barry, pretended to be a corrupt Russian mailman that was a hellbent on convincing Kimmel that his mail-in ballot would be safe in his hands.

With no living bodies able to fill the seats at Staples Center on Sunday, the Emmy's production crew placed cardboard cut-outs of the nominees in the first few rows.

But Jimmy quickly recognized that out of these 'cardboard cut-outs' was actually a living and breathing Jason Bateman.

Ha ha: Jason Sudeikis was one of the many famous faces to present during the award show and the 45-year-old SNL alum made sure to poke fun at the strict protocols put in place by the TV Academy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 

Not so fast: And, in the middle of presenting the trophy for Outstanding Comedy Series, Jason was approached by a nurse wearing scrubs, gloves, mask, and face shield

And, in the middle of presenting the trophy for Outstanding Comedy Series, Jason was approached by a nurse wearing scrubs, gloves, mask, and face shield.   

'Really? Can't wait five minutes?' he uttered as the nurse shoved a q-tip up his nose. 

Gabrielle Union, donning just a robe and a shower cap, Zoomed into the evening to introduce the acclaimed HBO series Insecure in the Outstanding Comedy Series category.

Lyrical: But the 47-year-old, with husband Dwyane Wade, 38, behind her, felt it was best to express her love for the show through rap

But the 47-year-old, with husband Dwyane Wade, 38, behind her, felt it was best to express her love for the show through rap.   

'Black girl magic, my girls do they duty / And in the love scenes, they show the boys' booties / Yeah, I said what I said,' she began, while bobbing and weaving to her own beat.

'The show's mad funny / Issa's tryina' find herself, Molly's got money / They in and out of love, it's oh so cute to see / And did I mention, in the love scenes, they show the boys' booties!'

Dwyane put forth some hilarious facial expressions as he attempted to take in his wife's words.

Losing sucks: Ramy Youssef of Hulu's Ramy gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at what it is like to 'lose the emmy'

Better luck next time: The anonymous presenter waved at Ramy, who lost to Schitt's Creek star Eugene Levy in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category, before fleeing with the highly-coveted statue

Ramy Youssef of Hulu's Ramy gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at what it is like to 'lose the emmy.'

The 29-year-old comedian snapped a picture of one of the evening's hazmat suited presenters hanging outside his home with an Emmy Award in their hand.

The anonymous presenter waved at Ramy, who lost to Schitt's Creek star Eugene Levy in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category, before fleeing with the highly-coveted statue.

Schitt's Creek, which was created by Eugene and his son Daniel, swept in the Comedy category on Sunday evening, with all of the top acting prizes going to the series' four main characters.

Wow: Schitt's Creek, which was created by Eugene and his son Daniel, swept in the Comedy category on Sunday evening, with all of the top acting prizes going to the series' four main characters

Haters gonna hate: When Daniel took to the stage for his umpteenth Emmy of the evening, he hilariously blurted out: 'Oh no, the internet is about to turn on me!'

When Daniel took to the stage for his umpteenth Emmy of the evening, he hilariously blurted out: 'Oh no, the internet is about to turn on me!' 

Hollywood completely shutdown in late March, which forced active projects to hit pause and swept many impending projects to the infinite wayside.

Sunday evening's Emmy Award ceremony, prior to the pandemic, was set for its usual format, a live audience at the Microsoft Theatre in Downtown Los Angeles. 

But, due to the aggressive and looming nature of the pandemic, it was decided that the 2020 award show would be moved to a mostly virtual format.

Complying: So, in order to adhere to COVID-19 precautions, Jimmy Kimmel was forced to perform his hosting duties for an empty audience at the Staples Center

In a statement published in July, ABC and the Television Academy said that they intended on delivering 'a live show that is both celebratory and safe.' 

So, in order to adhere to COVID-19 precautions, Jimmy Kimmel was forced to perform his hosting duties for an empty audience at the Staples Center. 

Most nominees virtually attended the annual award show via webcam, while some, such as Jennifer Aniston and Zendaya, appeared at the iconic venue alongside Kimmel. 

Presenters in full hazmat gear, personally delivered awards to winners' homes.
