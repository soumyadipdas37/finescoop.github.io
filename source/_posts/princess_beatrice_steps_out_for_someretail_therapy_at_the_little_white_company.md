Princess Beatrice was seen in public today for the first time since her wedding as she enjoyed a trip to the baby shop The Little White Company with new husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. 

The Queen's granddaughter, 32, donned a facemask as she popped into the store in London, while her new husband Edo, 36, patiently waited in the car for her. 

The royal could be seen carrying a white bag from upmarket highstreet brand The White Company's children's range as she strolled through the city's streets. 

Her appearance is the first time she has stepped out in public since the couple tied the knot in a secret ceremony on July 17.

The royal opted for a casual look and donned a facemask as she stepped out to shop in London earlier today 

Princess Beatrice opted for a trendy blue pleated midi skirt as she stepped out in London today, pairing the look with a smart black military style blazer.

Meanwhile she ensured she stayed comfortable with a pair of casual white trainers.

The royal wore her red hair in a relaxed flowing style over her shoulders, and ensured she stayed safe during the trip by wearing a medical grade mask. 

She carried her phone in one hand, and clutched a bag from The Little White Company in her other. 

The royal slipped back into the car alongside her husband a short while later, carrying the singular shopping bag from The Little White Company  

It appeared the royal kept the shopping trip brief, and slipped into the car alongside her husband with just one shopping bag.  

The White Company sells everything from £20 scented candles to £200 cashmere jumpers, while the children's range sells clothing, toys and blankets. 

It is Princess Beatrice's first appearance since marrying Edo in July and comes after the couple returned from a low-key honeymoon in France.

Earlier this summer the couple, who had a secret wedding with just 20 guests, were spotted by an eagle-eyed tourist as they drove ‘a small car absolutely packed to the roof with stuff’ in the south of France.

‘It was such a surprise to see them,’ the tourist said. ‘Edo was behind the wheel and they looked just like any other couple enjoying the beautiful drive.’

The couple tied the knot on July 17 with Beatrice wearing a 1953 Norman Hartnell dress borrowed from the Queen and the Queen Mary tiara the monarch wore on her own wedding day.

Beatrice’s father, Prince Andrew, walked her down the aisle but he has not featured in any of the publicly released pictures amid the controversy over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.

A source said Beatrice and Edo had planned to skip a traditional honeymoon, but decided at the last minute to take a trip across the Channel.

‘The wedding was arranged in a couple of weeks, and with lockdown their choice of honeymoon destinations was severely curtailed.

‘They weren’t going to bother but at the last minute they decided to pack up the car and head out. They’re a very down-to-earth couple.’

It is understood that they are planning a trip to Lamu Island, off Kenya, where Edo’s family own a home and where he took Beatrice in the early days of their romance.

The property developer fell for the Princess after meeting her at the wedding of her sister Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018.

It marked the first time the Queen's granddaughter has been seen in public since her secret wedding in July

At the time he was living with his fiancee Dara Huang, 38, the mother of his four-year-old son Wolfie.

Ms Huang was said to be distraught when Edo began dating Beatrice, but the three are now firm friends. ‘Dara was devastated at the beginning but she has always maintained good relations for the sake of their son,’ said a friend. 

‘She and Beatrice get along well. Beatrice is very kind and sweet to Wolfie.’ 

It emerged that Ms Huang, who runs Design Haus Liberty, an architecture firm, has moved her UK base into the same West London building from which Edo runs his property business.
