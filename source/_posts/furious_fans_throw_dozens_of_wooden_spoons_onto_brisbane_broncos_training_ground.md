Furious fans have hurled dozens of wooden spoons onto the Brisbane Broncos training ground after the beleaguered rugby league side finished the season in last spot on the NRL ladder.

A video posted to Twitter shows a staffer reluctantly collecting dozens of the cooking implements from the Red Hill base in Brisbane's west on Friday morning.

The Broncos claimed victory in just one of 18 games played after lockdowns, with Thursday night's loss to the North Queensland Cowboys their 11th in a row. 

The 'wooden spoon' is said to be handed to the team which finishes last during the regular season.

Retiring Broncos star Darius Boyd (pictured with wife Kayla) could not lift the Broncos to a win in Thursday game against North Queensland despite an early try

While the Broncos jumped to an early lead in the match after retiring star Darius Boyd scored an early try, their sub-par defence let the Cowboys claw their way back. 

The 32-16 loss, on the back of a hat-trick by North Queensland's Kyle Feldt, put the Broncos on the bottom of the ladder at the close of a season for the first time in the club's 33 year history. 

Fans of the club were less than impressed with another video emerging that appears to show a group of young males lobbing the wooden spoons onto the field under cover of darkness. 

'Never thought I'd see the day ... Broncos getting the spoon' Quade Cooper tweeted.

Boyd was making his 337th and final NRL appearance, and while he did his best to lift to Brisbane side they finished with three tries to North Queensland's six.  

The season was a strange one for the retiring star to end his career on, with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting fixtures and crowds. 

The Broncos' poor performance also resulted in Boyd being stripped of his captaincy during the season and coach Anthony Seibold having his contract cut short at two years into a five year deal.

But there was one final highlight Boyd had up his sleeve, with the famously private 33-year-old staging an unexpected gender reveal after the match by kicking a footy into the stands at Suncorp Stadium. 

He and wife Kayla are having a girl, their third daughter, a puff of pink smoke revealed as his teammates let up a cheer and hugged the former Clive Churchill Medal winner. 

Brisbane's standout player for the 2020 season, 21-year-old Kotoni Staggs, had to leave the field in the Cowboys match suffering a suspected ACL tear. 

The injury could sideline the rising star until mid-2021. 

The Cowboy's win sees them at third-last in the NRL table ahead of the Bulldogs and Broncos, while the Penrith Panthers have won the minor premiership ahead of the Melbourne Storm and Roosters.
