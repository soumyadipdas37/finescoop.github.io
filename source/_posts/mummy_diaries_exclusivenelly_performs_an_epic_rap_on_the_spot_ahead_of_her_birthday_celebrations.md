Nelly Shepherd leaves mother Billie Faiers seriously impressed on Thursday's episode of The Mummy Diaries with her epic rapping skills.

During the episode, which was filmed earlier this year, Billie, 30, and Nelly, then five and now six, are discussing her birthday celebrations in July.

Revealing that she wants to make her own ice cream sundae, Billie suggests: 'Why not get up and do a performance on your birthday for everyone. You could get up and rap? Do a birthday rap? That would be very cool.'

Nelly goes on to reference her family in the rap, saying 'her mother wears her fashion gown', 'her dad was a cool man' and 'her brother [Arthur, three] is a troublemaker'.

Elsewhere in the episode, Billie and husband Greg Shepherd are left gutted after their planning permission is denied by Brentwood Borough Council.

The former TOWIE star, 30, and her spouse, 35, purchased a run down 1920s property earlier this year and had dreamed of turning it into a five-bedroom £1.4 million dream home over a planned year and a half long project.  

Yet on Thursday's episode, Billie and Greg discover their plans have been 'shattered' as their planning permission has been denied by Brentwood Borough Council in Essex.

Talking to the camera in a behind-the-scenes clip, Billie says: 'We just feel absolutely gutted don't we. I didn't think I would feel as upset about it as I do.

'It's on my mind, I just can't get it out of my head, I just feel like all the plans we made have been shattered... I know it sounds dramatic, but that's just how I feel.'

To which Greg adds: 'It's now going to go on for months and months. We don't know where we stand really at the minute.' 

Yet despite their woes, which were filmed earlier this year, the couple have since received a green light on their dream home after reducing the building by a matter of centimetres.
