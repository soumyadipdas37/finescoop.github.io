Premier Daniel Andrews has revealed that Health Minister Jenny Mikakos told him in a text message that she had decided to resign.

The Victorian leader fended off tough questions on Saturday, when he fronted the media on Saturday, only hours after Ms Mikakos abruptly stood down as a minister and a member of parliament.

Mr Andrews told reporters she made the right decision and he thanked her for her service.

'I did not speak with the Minister before she resigned and I have not spoken to her since,' Mr Andrews said.

'She sent me a text. She has resigned. She is no longer a Minister.

'I believe that Jenny has made the right choice but she made that choice and I have taken the opportunity, and I will take it again, to acknowledge... a dedicated person.'

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has revealed that Health Minister Jenny Mikakos told him in a text message that she had decided to resign

Mr Andrews named mental health minister Martin Foley as Ms Mikakos' replacement. 

His praise came after Ms Mikakos posted to Twitter that her integrity been 'undermined' and that she could no longer serve in the Premier's Cabinet.

The ugly, public break-up, comes as pressure mounts on the government over their handling of the state's quarantine hotel blunder. 

Premier Andrews told an Inquiry into the matter yesterday that he regarded Ms Mikakos 'accountable for the program', which led to a surge in coronavirus cases and a statewide lockdown.

Less than 24 hours after the premier made his comments, Ms Mikakos  walked out on the job, becoming the first domino to fall.

On her way out the door she did not hesitate to take one final swipe at Mr Andrews, saying she too wanted to know who was responsible for the hotel disaster.

At an inquiry in the bungled quarantine program on Thursday, Ms Mikakos (pictured taking the oath) recalled she did not know private guards were enforcing the scheme until late May

'I have never wanted to leave the job unfinished but in light of the Premier’s statement to the Board of the inquiry and the fact that there are elements in it that I strongly disagree with, I believe that I cannot continue to serve in his Cabinet,' Ms Mikakos said in a statement on Twitter.

'I am disappointed that my integrity has sought to be undermined.

'I have today written to the Governor of Victoria to resign my commissions as a Minister effective today. I will also be resigning from the Parliament.'

Pressure on Ms Mikakos mounted after her testimony to the inquiry on Thursday was conflicted by Mr Andrews' on Friday.

Ms Mikakos told the hearing that 'to the best of her recollection' she did not know private guards were enforcing the scheme until late May when the Rydges hotel suffered a coronavirus outbreak.

But a video of a press conference on 29 March - two days after the quarantine scheme was announced - shows Ms Mikakos standing alongside jobs minister Martin Pakula as he said: 'Passengers returning will now undergo mandatory two-week quarantine at those Melbourne hotels with security guards in place.'

On Friday Premier Daniel Andrews told the inquiry he regarded Ms Mikakos 'accountable' for the hotel quarantine program.

The virus escaped from hotel quarantine in late May and sparked the state's second wave which has seen more than 700 deaths.

The Victorian government has faced criticism for not accepting ADF troops and instead using private security guards, some of whom flouted social distancing rules and failed to properly wear PPE, witnesses told the inquiry.

Ms Mikakos said she was 'not part of the decision-making process' to use private security guards.

'With the benefit of hindsight, there are clearly matters that my department should have briefed me on,' Ms Mikakos said in her resignation letter.

'Whether they would have changed the course of events only the Board and history can determine.

'For three months I had looked forward to learning who made the fateful decision to use security guards. Victorians deserve to know.'

But while Ms Mikakos acknowledged she is responsible for her department and that 'the buck stops with me'.

She also said 'it is not her responsibility alone' and does not believe her actions contributed to the second wave of cases which have ravaged the state.
