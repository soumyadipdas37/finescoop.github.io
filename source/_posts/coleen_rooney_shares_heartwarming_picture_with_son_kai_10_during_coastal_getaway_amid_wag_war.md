She is embroiled in an ongoing feud with fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy. 

But Coleen Rooney appeared to set the drama aside as she made the most of a day out with her eldest son Kai on Sunday.

The mother-of-four, 34, beamed as she posed on the picturesque shorefront with her 10-year-old son.

Coleen protected herself from the blustering winds with a padded jacket and cream jumper. 

She let her natural beauty shine through with a minimal makeup look and framed her face with classic cat-eye shades. 

Kai displayed his freckled features and bore a striking resemblance to his football star father, Wayne Rooney. 

WAG WAR: The mother-of-four, 34, enjoyed a day out with her son despite her ongoing feud and upcoming legal battle against fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy

They appeared care-free in the touching mother-son snap, despite the mother-of-four's recent controversies. 

Coleen is expected to face Rebekah, 38, in court this November – one year after she accused her former friend of leaking stories about her to the press, a claim that Rebekah vehemently denies.

The wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy, is seeking substantial damages in the libel trial, as she claims to have suffered 'severe and extreme hostility and abuse' in the fallout after the claims were published on Instagram.

The Mirror reports that judge Mr. Justice Nicklin has stated a preliminary trial will decide the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of Coleen’s social media posts.

He has also given Coleen until October 2 to serve a 'statement of case'.

In the September 17 court order he stated: 'It is ordered by consent that there be a trial of the preliminary issue of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of.'

The half-day trial, he has stated, would be heard by a judge specialising in media and communication after November 15.  

Coleen has yet to file a defense, though it has been revealed by the judge that she isn't obliged to do so until 28 days after the preliminary hearing.

Court costs are expected to stay under £25,000 on each side, according to the publication, with any party exceeding the limit being required to justify them.
