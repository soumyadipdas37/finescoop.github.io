Their rekindled romance has been going from strength-to-strength.

And Yazmin Oukhellou and James Lock looked smitten as they stepped out for dinner together at Sexy Fish in Mayfair, London, on Tuesday.

The TOWIE stars, aged 26 and 33, were seen holding hands as they strolled to the trendy eatery for their night out.

Smitten: TOWIE's Yazmin Oukhellou put on a loved-up display with on-again beau James Lock as they held hands while heading out for dinner in Mayfair, London, on Tuesday

Yaz put on a busty display in a plunging black Fendi jumpsuit that fit snugly on her slender frame and featured a semi-sheer belt to accentuate her waist. 

She boosted her height in a pair of open-toe heels, and she kept her personal items in a small clutch bag.

The reality star wore her raven tresses in a sleek, straight style that fell over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

James matched his girlfriend's fashion choices, as he tucked in a short-sleeved black shirt into a pair of matching slacks.

Yazmin had dumped Lockie over claims he had cheated on her while they were on a romantic holiday together in Turkey, and has said she still doesn't trust him but wouldn't say 'no' if he popped the question.

Speaking to The Sun, the brunette beauty said: 'We are trying to take things really slow but I know what I am like.  

'I do love him and if he did propose to me I would say yes and marry him. I still don't trust him but I do trust him more this time, which is strange because he messed up. But I do believe he has changed.'

Yazmin also revealed that the couple are now having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom after starting during lockdown, which is helping get their broken relationship back on track. 

She added that her family and friends around her are still sceptical about the reunion but that she needs to 'prove everyone wrong'.

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.
