The battle of the relegated saw Bournemouth come out with their unbeaten Championship record intact, beating Norwich 1-0 at the Vitality. 

The clubs finished 18th and 20th in last season's Premier League campaign and are aiming to bounce-back immediately this season, with the Cherries getting off to the better start after four games. 

Bournemouth lie in fourth after Arnaut Danjuma's superb strike, smashing into the bottom corner from 25 yards after 35 minutes, before the hosts held off Daniel Farke's men to the whistle.
