Back from their summer in the Hamptons, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick appear to have NYC real estate on their mind. 

The Hollywood couple who already own several properties in Manhattan, were spotted walking around their West Village neighborhood as they looked at a few homes and snapped some photos. 

Sarah, 55, and Matthew, 58, seemed to be dipping their toes back into the housing market, as they are currently looking to sell their townhouse for $19million.

For their day of real estate hunting the pair prioritized comfort, keeping themselves dressed down in grey outfits.

Parker wore a matching grey sweatsuit with a white stripe down the pant legs that she layered under a black velour blazer.  

She dressed the lowkey look up with a pair of black strappy heels adorned with a brown heel and a peep toe. 

The Sex and the City star wore her signature long blonde locks tied back in a high ponytail, accessorizing her look with a pink strapped cross body bag and a printed mask.

Matthew walked beside his wife of 23 years as they explored their beloved city together. 

He kept it casual in a grey pullover cardigan and a pair of cuffed grey jeans, as he slipped a pair of black sneakers on his feet. 

The Ferris Bueller star topped the monochromatic look off with a navy blue face mask and his signature glasses, as he walked with his hands in his pocket. 

Stopping to help Parker snap a pic, the pair looked up admiring the architecture in their picturesque neighborhood.

Parker who also has flagships stores for her SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker line appeared to take a vested interest in storefronts as well, as they appeared to chat in front of a renovated property. 

The couple originally purchased their current West Village townhouse - which was built in 1905 - for a cool $2.99M in 2000. 

Parker and Broderick have since put extensive work into property, and are inching close to selling as first reported earlier this year.

The duo is currently building their dream mega-mansion in the city, after purchasing two neighboring townhouses in 2016 for $35M and combining them into one massive home. 

The mega-mansion townhouse currently has two addresses due to its scale, and has now been combined into one 14,000 square foot unit which will serve as the family's primary residence in NYC. 

The phenomenal property is set to have all the bells and whistles, including a private garden.

The sprawling unit takes up a good portion of the street and the project is being spearheaded by famous NYC architect Morris Adjmi. 

Though the building currently maintains a classic exterior, Adjmi and his associates focus on sleek and modern sustainable design, which will likely be translated into the Parker-Broderick home.  

Though SJP is incredibly hands on when it comes to her flagship stores, the television veteran appeared to take the day off with her husband to focus on their living arrangements. 

The couple will share their enormous property with their three children, James, 17, and twin girls Marion and Tabitha, 11.
