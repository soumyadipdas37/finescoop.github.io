Wonder Woman star Lynda Carter and daughter Jessica Carter Altman make quite the dynamic duo.

The TV star, 69, and her youngest child, 29, looked like they could be sisters as they charmed Access Daily's Mario Lopez and Kit Hoover in a new interview.

The beautiful brunettes were glowing as they opened up about their close bond, with Jessica calling her mom 'even more wonderful' than her superhero alter-ego.

'She embodies the character every single day,' lawyer/singer Jessica told Access.

'I think every person believes and sees the character as a strong woman figure in their lives. 

'Their moms, their girlfriends, their grandmothers, their aunts, their sisters,' she continued about the comic character, which will be celebrating its 80th anniversary next year.

Lavishing her mom in praise, Jessica went on: 'I just feel really lucky that my mom is even more wonderful than the character.'

'She taught me how to be strong, she taught me how to be brave and she taught me that I could do whatever it is that I want to do, and that I didn't have to fit anyone else's ideal,' she went on. 'I just had to be myself.'

Lynda - who shares Jessica and son James, 32, with ZeniMax Media CEO Robert Altman - explained why Wonder Woman's legacy has been so empowering, calling the DC legend 'iconic for her heart and her intellect and her strength and beauty.'

Not only did Jessica take after her mom's kindness, but she also developed her own love of entertaining, recently releasing her own EP of songs called No Rules.

And it was mom who actually got her daughter involved in music.

'It started off as a family affair,' Jessica told Mario and Kit. 'My brother had performed with my mom at the Kennedy Center and my mom when I was in law school asked me if I would consider performing with her, not really realizing how nerve wracking it would be until I actually walked on stage.'

That first gig lead to many more, something with Carter Altman feels blessed for.

'It's been such a fun experience to not only for the first time be able to work in that professional way, not just to see the final project but the watch her work,' Jessica explained. 'To be on stage and to share those really special moments together.'

Lynda looked back on her own time singing, calling her duets with music big shots like Kenny Rogers and Ray Charles 'a dream come true,' while adding that making music with her kids even 'tops that.' 

Musical family: Jessica also talked about how mom sparked her love for singing. She just released an EP titled No Rules
