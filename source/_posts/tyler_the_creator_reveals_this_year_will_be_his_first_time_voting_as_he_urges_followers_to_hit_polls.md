Tyler, the Creator has been known for his outspoken ways, including some past controversies.

But the Grammy winner's latest use of his massive platform is spreading a message that most can agree with.

He revealed Monday in an IGTV video that this year will be his first time voting, as he urged his 10million Instagram followers to hit the polls as well, teaming up with Converse to help register voters.

The 29-year-old said as he sat outside: 'Yo, it's T. Look, I know I'm the last person y'all should ever take advice from, but I'm reiterating what everyone else is saying. 

'Please, please, if you are young, and your f***ing back don't hurt, go to them polls and cast a f***ing vote. And I didn't give a f*** about none of this s***, just like a lot of y'all. This is actually gonna be my first time voting. But I... I see the light.'

He's not the only celeb making his first appearance at the polls this year, as Snoop Dogg and Mike Tyson have also revealed they're their voting. 

Tyler used the opportunity to call out social media activists, adding: 'And a lot of y'all gonna be like, "Whah! My vote doesn't matter, and they're gonna pick who they want!"

First time: He continued: 'And I didn't give a f*** about none of this s***, just like a lot of y'all. This is actually gonna be my first time voting. But I... I see the light'

Pull up: Tyler concluded, urging fans to vote in-person if they can: 'And I'm not a f***ing encyclopedia on this s***, but I know one god-d*** thing, that if you want any of that, then y'all know what to do. You n****s gotta pull up'

Candid: He reiterated the importance of registering to vote and then voting

'Yeah, you weird a** n****, keep that up. Y'all was posting black squares and protesting from your phone, and "rights" this, cancelling everybody, n****. Pull up. Y'all want a new DA? Pull up. Y'all want all these rights and s***, then pull up.'

He also mentioned some of the issues that are driving him to the polls for the first time in his life.

The Igor artist continued: 'The s*** that I actually give a f*** about is more art in schools and more music classes in schools, and them changing the curriculum. They've had the same curriculum since 1442, judging everybody on the same s***. 

'And I have female friends that need certain things. And I like being able to f*** on and marry whoever the f*** I want at any given moment. And if we wanna keep some of those options, then we have to start somewhere. 

He concluded, urging fans to vote in-person if they can: 'And I'm not a f***ing encyclopedia on this s***, but I know one god-d*** thing, that if you want any of that, then y'all know what to do. You n****s gotta pull up.

True ally: The Kidding actor explained to i-D: 'I don't think that people realize that he's like one of the first ones to really understand. He's not just like, "I love America, I love African Americans." No, he likes n****s' (pictured in November, 2019)

'Actually go to the polls, 'cause some of that mail-in s***, n****s gonna try to call fraud. So, if you can go to the polls, and I know them lines gonna be long, and it's gonna be hot, but please. Do that. Alright? It's hot as f***, and this was like my third take of this video. And yes. Love.'

Tyler also took to his Insta Story with a tweet he posted earlier this month: 'make sure yall n****s register to vote.....and then vote.'

Although he apparently didn't vote in the last election, he revealed his love for Bernie Sanders in 2016, releasing a t-shirt with Sanders' face above the words 'loves n****s' from his line Golf Wang.
