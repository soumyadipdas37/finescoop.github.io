Production on The Last Duel was shut down in March as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the film industry,

But filming on the all-star blockbuster has finally resumed in Ireland this week, with stars Jodie Comer, Matt Damon and Adam Driver seen on set on Monday.

Jodie was in full 14th century costume for her scenes, while both she and Matt added contemporary face shields to their looks, in keeping with strict health and safety measures on set. 

They're back! Production on The Last Duel was shut down in March as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the film industry, but filming resumed in Ireland on Monday as Jodie Comer was spotted on set

Jodie was a far cry from her most famous role as Villanelle in Killing Eve, dressed in a pink velvet gown and corset.

Her blonde hair was styled into elaborate braids for the day's filming.

As she carefully hitched up her long robes to walk to set, Jodie wore a face visor, while crew members escorting her were in masks.

Matt was also seen in his visor, teamed with bronze robes. The Hollywood star looked delighted to be back filming, grinning and waving at the huge crowd of fans who had gathered to catch a glimpse of the stars.

Meanwhile the film's other leading man Adam Driver kept his costume covered with a waterproof coat as he talked to members of the crew between takes.

Adapted from Eric Jager's book of the same name, it follows the true story of Jean de Carrouges (Damon), a 14th century knight who embarks on a fight to the death with former friend Jacques Le Gris (Driver) after accusing him of raping his wife. 

Jodie plays Marguerite de Carrouges, the woman at the centre of the fight in the Ridley Scott-directed epic.

The Last Duel marks the first return of Matt's writing partnership with Ben Affleck since their award-winning script for Good Will Hunting.  

Matt co-wrote the screenplay alongside Nicole Holofcener and his longstanding writing partner Ben, the latter is also starring in the film, although he wasn't seen on set on Monday.

Originally, Matt and Ben were set to play the two leading roles in the film, but they ran into scheduling conflicts because of Ben's film Deep Water, so he is now set to play King Charles VI, while Adam was cast to take over the role of Le Gris.

Filming began on the movie in February in France but the set was shut down in March due to the pandemic and travel restrictions in Europe. 

Matt was at the film's next location in Ireland when lockdown began and amid the travel ban ended up isolating in the seaside resort of Dalkey, an affluent suburb of Dublin with his wife and four children for a few weeks.

The Last Duel had a scheduled released date of December 2020 but it has now been pushed back to October 15, 2021.
