It has been six years since she was left heartbroken after failing to win the heart of Blake Garvey on The Bachelor in 2014.

But on Wednesday, Zoe O'Brien still couldn't relate to Bella's infatuation as she made her feelings of disgust against Locky Gilbert known on her Instagram Stories.

The reality star couldn't resist brutally trolling Locky as she asked her followers what the girls saw in a man who had a 'strength and honour' tattoo.

Watching the show in her living room, Zoe shared a clip of teary-eyed Bella leaping into Locky's arm at the end of their hometown date.

She added the harsh caption: 'Can someone please remind me why ALL of these girls are crying over a guy with a chest tat that says: "Strength and Honour".

Following her failed attempt on The Bachelor in 2014, Zoe starred on Bachelor In Paradise in 2018, however, proved unsuccessful in her quest to find love yet again.

In an interview with the Herald Sun on Thursday, Irena confessed she would be 'heartbroken' if Locky chose Bella, after falling hard for him.

'I have fallen head over heels crazy for Locky, I see him as my future partner, my husband, the father of my children,' she revealed.
