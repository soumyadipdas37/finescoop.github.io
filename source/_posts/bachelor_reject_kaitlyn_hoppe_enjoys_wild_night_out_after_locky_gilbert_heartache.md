She failed to win the heart of Locky Gilbert on this season of The Bachelor.

But Kaitlyn Hoppe appeared anything but heartbroken on Friday, as she headed out to Bedroom nightclub in Surfers Paradise, QLD - where she was spotted being straddled by a stunning female pal as the pair celebrated the venue's VIP launch.

The blonde bombshell, 26, wrapped her sensational figure in a tight sequinned dress for the occasion, showing off her tanned pins and ample assets in the process.

Clearly letting her hair down for the evening, Kaitlyn sprawled her body onto a chair while her close pal clambered on top of her.

Kaitlyn was seen in fits of giggles as her pal grabbed her thigh in a friendly embrace, before she straddled the former Bachelor star in front of the camera. 

The snaps come just a week after The Bachelor finale aired, showing Kaitlyn's former love interest Locky finally choose Irena Srbinovska as his winner. 

Kaitlyn had arrived as a latecomer into the competition, and appeared to have a spark with Locky on the show.

However, she was swiftly booted out before hometown visits - a move she claims came as quite a shock.

She told Popsugar after her exit: 'That night I thought I was getting a rose.

'I was honestly in a state of shock and confusion and I told him - I said, I'm really confused and he just said that maybe it's too late.'

Kaitlyn said that the pair, 'literally had a conversation at the cocktail party about 30 minutes prior to the rose ceremony about meeting his friends and family'.

She added: 'He asked if my family would like him. I thought I was definitely going to hometowns.'

The blonde beauty said her feelings for Locky were 'strong' and she 'experienced heartbreak' over the eviction.

Since leaving the show Kaitlyn has been linked to troubled Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic, however she has confirmed she is no longer dating him.

The pair had been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, and had reconnected about two months ago when Kaitlyn was kicked off The Bachelor.
