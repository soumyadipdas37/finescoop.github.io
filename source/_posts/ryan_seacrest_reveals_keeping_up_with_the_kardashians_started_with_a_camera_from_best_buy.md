Keeping Up With The Kardashians is ending on 2021 after 20 seasons, it was announced by the family on Tuesday.

And the next day the show's co-creator Ryan Seacrest talked about the end of the reality TV show with Kelly Ripa on Live With Kelly and Ryan!

The 45-year-old host reflected on how the super-hit show began with a camera bought at Best Buy and a wild family barbecue with Kim, Khloe and Kourtney and the rest of the clan as he noted that the program 'changed entertainment forever.' 

His point of view: Ryan Seacrest talked about the end of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians which he co-produces on Wednesday on his show with Kelly Ripa, Live With Kelly and Ryan!

That's a wrap, folks! The popular TV show will end in 2021 after season 20, Kim announced

'It's an amazing run,' he told Ripa as they returned to their studio after 180 days in lockdown over COVID-19..

'Thank you to the whole family,' Seacrest continued. 

'The sisters, especially Kris Jenner. I know her as my partner and dear friend. I feel like I'm family with her. I think she's one of the savviest business people on the planet. She manages family and an incredible empire, it's no small task.'

Early days of fame: The 45-year-old host reflected on how the super-hit show began with a camera bought at Best Buy and a wild family barbecue with Kim, Khloe and Kourtney and the rest of the clan as he noted that the program 'changed entertainment forever.' In 2007

He also looked back to when the show kicked off in 2007 when Kim was best known as Paris Hilton's sidekick pal.

'It was about 14 and a half years ago, [Kris Jenner] was looking to do a series with the family,' he said.

 'I was looking for my first series to produce. We met, and I remember they were gonna do a barbecue at their house. We had to go get a camera from Best Buy.'

The setting was a family barbecue where the kids let their personality out. 'There was yelling, laughter, hugs, all the ingredients to make a show,' Ryan noted.

The start: 'It was about 14 and a half years ago, [Kris Jenner] was looking to do a series with the family,' he said. 'I was looking for my first series to produce. We met, and I remember they were gonna do a barbecue at their house. We had to go get a camera from Best Buy'; Kris, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe in 2007

'We made a seven-minute tape out of it and showed it to E! We put the show on the air weeks later,' he said.

'Thank you to the Kardashians,' Seacrest added, 'who have changed entertainment forever.'

E! networks said of the cancellation: 'E! has been the home and extended family to the Kardashian-Jenners for what will be 14 years, featuring the lives of this empowering family. 

She was the hot ticket: Kim was already a semi star at that point but she looked different

Kim now: The 39-year-old star in a SKIMS ad shared on her Instagram account last week

Season 19 premieres September 17 on E! 

'Along with all of you, we have enjoyed following the intimate moments the family so bravely shared by letting us into their daily lives. 

'While it has been an absolute privilege and we will miss them wholeheartedly, we respect the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras. It is not our final goodbye yet, we are excited to have the new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians launching on September 17 with the final season airing in 2021.

The way they were: Over time, the ladies evolved as their social media profile rose. Kourtney, Khloe and Kim in 2011

'We thank the entire extended family and our production partners, Bunim Murray and Ryan Seacrest Productions for embarking on this global phenomenon together.'

In recent years numerous siblings, most recently Kourtney, have been reluctant to film the show. Kim has also endured a turbulent year with her husband Kanye West's mental health battle and controversial presidential run putting unprecedented strain on her marriage.

Throughout the years the show chronicled key events in the personal and professional lives of the California family, including Kim Kardashian's marriages to Kris Humphries and West, an armed robbery in Paris, the break-up of Khloe Kardashian's marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom, and the transition of family patriarch Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.   

In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, 39, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

Shock announcement: Kim revealed on Tuesday her family has made the 'difficult decision' to end Keeping Up With The Kardashians 

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. 

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives. 

One of the biggest moments: Khloe had her wedding to Lamar Odom filmed in 2009

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'

'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'

While the show has undoubtedly had an extraordinary run, its more recent series have suffered poor ratings. 

In April this year, it was reported that viewership had sunk to 871,000 viewers, making that episode the 4th lowest rated episode ever.  

Before things got very crazy: Scott Disick, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe, Mason Disick and Jonathan Cheban in Miami Beach in 2012

At its peak, KUWTK earned E! its most-watched day ever, when 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries - the episode, Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event - Part 2, aired in 2011.

The show also had an endless supply of celebrity guest stars over the years, but most notably there were appearances from Hugh Hefner, Mel B, Kobe Bryant, Lindsay Lohan, Serena Williams, and even TV legend Oprah Winfrey. 

The series famously gained momentum after Kim gained notoriety for starring in a leaked, home-made sex tape with singer Ray J. 

Porn company Vivid Entertainment bought the rights to the tape for $1 million, and released the film under the title Kim Kardashian, Superstar in February.  

Kim would later sue Vivid for ownership of the tape, but ended up settling for a reported $5 million. 

The controversy and notoriety surrounding the tape helped propel the start of the reality series.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!.

It had been pitched by mom-of-six Kris Jenner to  TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest who was looking to bring a fly-on-the-wall show to E! following the huge success of MTV's The Osbournes that ran from 2002 to 2005.

Kris persuaded him that she and her children - three daughters and a son with former O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Kardashian and two daughters with Olympic decathlete Bruce Jenner - would be a perfect fit. 

Fly on the wall: Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!

A few months before the first episode was set to air, a sex tape featuring Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian was leaked, generating headlines and interest in the 27-year-old.

She had made the tape in 2002 with then boyfriend Ray J but the timing of its release five years later couldn't have been better timed. 

The publicity surrounding the sex tape considerably raised Kim's public profile; until then she was best known for being an assistant to Simple Life star and hotel heiress Paris Hilton. 

Timing: Kris Jenner masterminded the reality show and a few months before the first episode aired, a sex tape starring her daughter Kim was leaked, generating huge interest in the series

The E! series made global stars of Kim and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian as well as her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. 

In the past 13 years, they have grown up on camera, sharing their life and loves, heartache and happiness, their changing faces and changing bodies, and the births of their own children.

More than that, though, they have taken TV fame and spun it into a huge money-making empire, with a lot of help from social media and some very clever marketing.

They mastered the art of keeping hundreds of millions of Twitter and Instagram users engaged with multiple posts a day and then found ways to make money from it.

They used their platforms to sell everything from makeup and perfume to waist trainers and underwear, while also striking lucrative endorsement deals and signing up for high-paid public appearances.  

Throughout it all, Kris has managed her children's careers, taking 10 percent of their earnings in addition to her own fees from the TV show and its spin-offs.

While KUWTK may be coming to an end after 20 seasons, there's no doubt we haven't heard the last of the momager, her kids and grandkids. 

Kylie Jenner - KUWTK made her a billionaire (well, almost) 

She is the youngest of Kris Jenner's six children but she's also now the richest.

Kylie Jenner, 23, is the youngest but richest of the KUWTK stars

Kylie, 23, made the cover of Forbes magazine in 2019 as the 'the world's youngest self-made billionaire' after she sold 51 percent of her Kylie Cosmetics company to beauty giant Coty in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.

Forbes subsequently retracted the 'billionaire' title reckoning that, in reality, she was only worth an estimated $900 million.

Kylie's personal wealth came thanks mainly to her decision to start getting lip fillers when she was 18. And while she initially denied getting enhancements, she later acknowledged it and launched a collection of lip kits in 2015.

The following year, due to the tremendous success of her initial products, she launched Kylie Cosmetics. 

Kylie has also partnered with sister Kendall in a clothing line, founded her own skincare line, Kylie Skin, and released her own fragrance through half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty.  

Kim Kardashian - Game app, shapewear and beauty products add up to $900 million

It can certainly be argued that without her sex tape, she and her family might never have achieved unimaginable wealth.

But while Kim Kardashian Superstar raised her profile, Kim, 39, made sure to capitalize on every opportunity that came her way subsequently.

Kim, 29, earns up to  a rumored $1 million for a paid Instagram post

Unquestionably the star of her family's reality show, her televised 2011 wedding to NBA pro Kris Humphries was a ratings blockbuster. Her divorce and subsequent marriage to rapper Kanye West kept fans fascinated by her private life.

Forbes estimates Kim's fortune to be $900 million.

In 2014, she launched mobile game app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and it made $1.6 million in the first five days after its release. In 2015, she released her own range of Kimojis.

In addition to her TV fees, paid endorsements and appearances, the bulk of Kim's wealth comes thanks to her KKW Beauty company. 

In 2019, the Product line raked in $100 million and she gained $200 million by selling a 20 percent stake in the company to Coty, the same company that bought Kylie's brand. 

Her SKIMS shapewear launched last year is also a huge revenue generator and she can earn up to $1 million for a paid Instagram post. 

Kris Jenner - the momager takes her cut to the tune of $90 million (at the very least) 

As her daughters' manager, Kris, 64, get a 10 percent cut of each of their earnings

Kris, 64, is the mastermind behind everything Kardashian, and that's how she makes her fortune.

In 2018, Forbes reckoned her net worth to be $37.5 million but it's certainly grown plenty since then with some placing her true net worth at somewhere between $90 and $140 million.

The bulk of her income comes from her 10 percent fees as the manager of her children's careers.

She also has stakes in some of her kids' companies; for example, when Kylie sold her cosmetics company in 2019, Kris pocketed $60 million from the deal, Forbes reported.

Khloe Kardashian - denim and workouts bring her an estimated $50 million

Khloe Kardashian, 36, has dramatically transformed her look during the series

Khloe, 36, has carved out her own niche in the Kardashian family marketplace.

She is perhaps the sister who has most transformed their look in recent years, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.

Her fitness regimen in the wake of her divorce from Lamar Odom helped land her her own TV show Revenge Body, and she also hosted the TV chat show Kocktails With Khloe.

In 2016, she founded Good American, which began with a line of jeans and has since expanded to include bodysuits, activewear and swimwear. 

Kourtney Kardashian - lifestyle website helps Poosh her earnings to upwards of $35 million

Kourtney Kardashian, 41, makes most of her money from the TV show

Kourtney, 41, the eldest of the Kardashian siblings, is most reliant on the TV show for her income.

However, like her sisters, she makes money with paid product endorsements and paid Instagram posts.

In 2017 she partnered with fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing.

Then last year, Kourtney launched her lifestyle website Poosh where companies can sell their products directly to consumers attracted to Kourtney's brand.  

Kendall Jenner - modeling career enhanced TV fame for $30 million net worth

Kendall Jenner, 24, earns millions from her modeling career

Kendall, 24, turned her attention several years ago to trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a fashion model.

Thanks to her TV and social media celebrity, she won contracts with some of the world's top brands making her the highest-paid model of 2018, according to Forbes.

Forbes estimated her net worth at $22.5 million but it's only increased since then.

She has also teamed up with younger sister Kylie for clothing, jewelry and swimwear lines and like the rest of her sisters, she gets plenty of paid endorsement work.

Rob Kardashian - sporadic TV appearances net him $10 million

Rob, 33, is the only boy in the family of girls and has played a much more low-key role in the KUWTK world.

Initially featuring on the reality show, he subsequently retreated from the spotlight as he battled a number of health issues.

He had his won sock company Arthur George and in 2016, he agreed to star in a spin-off Rob & Chyna, that followed his relationship with fiancee Blac Chyna and the birth of their daughter Dream.

His estimated $10 million net worth comes mostly from his TV appearance fees. 

 

Keeping Up With The Kardashians just announced it will be ending next year after 20 seasons on TV. 

And while plenty of things have changed for the superstar family in the past 14 years, nothing has evolved as much as the sisters' looks.

Since 2007 Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian went from wild 20-somethings with heavy eyeliner habits to chic, contour-savvy CEOs and moms.

At the same time Kendall and Kylie Jenner grew-up in front of the camera, transforming from awkward preteens into their ultra glamorous selves of today.

Though it's undeniable that styles - and budgets - have changed since the start, many think the ladies have had a little extra help throughout the seasons.

The girls began to flaunt fuller lips, changing curves and ever-thinning noses as the years went on.

While Kim and company have kept coy about their procedures, the sisters have fueled more than a few cosmetic surgery trends along the way, prompting fans to flock to their doctors to get that Kardashian-plump pout or Kim-inspired derriere.
