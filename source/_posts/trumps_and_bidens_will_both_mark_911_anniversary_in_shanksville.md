Both the Trumps and the Bidens will travel to Shanksville, Pennsylvania next Friday to mark the 19th anniversary of the September 11th attacks but it remains unclear if the presidential rivals with cross paths.

Joe Biden's campaign announced he and Jill would be in the city to mark the occasion of the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil. No further details were announced and the campaign did not respond to a request for them.

And the White House said President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump would also be in Pennsylvania. The Trumps marked 9/11 in Shanksville in 2018 and spent the 2017 and 2019 anniversaries at the Pentagon.

'To mark the 19th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our country and to honor and remember the lives lost, President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will travel to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, next Friday. This will be the President's second time to mark this solemn day at the Flight 93 National Memorial,' deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement to DailyMail.com.

It's unclear how the two couples will participate in the anniversary and if they will cross paths.

The National Park Service will host the Nineteenth Anniversary Observance on Friday, September 11, 2020 at 9:45 am.

This year's ceremony will be shorter and have a more reduced attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The usual 90 minute ceremony will be reduced to a to a 20 minute 'Moment of Remembrance,' the National Park Service says on its website. The park service arranges the memorial and cares for the area.

There will be no keynote speaker nor musical talent. The name of each passenger and crew member will be read aloud with the ringing of the Bells of Remembrance. This moment will observe the exact time Flight 93 crashed at 10:03 a.m.  

In the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton both observed the 9/11 anniversary at the Ground Zero memorial in lower Manhattan. 

But the day gained significance after Clinton abruptly left the ceremony and was captured on video looking unsteady as she tried to get into a van. Her campaign later said she had pneumonia and she took a few days off the campaign trail to recover.

Biden previously attended a memorial service for Flight 93 in 2012, when he was the vice president.

Just outside Shanksville is the 2,200-acre Flight 93 National Memorial Park, which marks the spot where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field on September 11, 2001, killing all 40 civilians and four al-Qaeda hijackers on board. 

The hijackers had intended to fly the plane to Washington, D.C. but when the passengers on board, after learning from family members via airphone of the earlier attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, revolted and fought for control of the plane, causing it to crash. 

It was the only one of the four aircraft hijacked that day that never reached its intended target - believed to be either the White House or the U.S. Capitol building. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attack.

The Flight 93 National Memorial is built around the crash site and protects the area of impact, known as the 'Sacred Ground', which remains accessible only to family members of the passengers and crew.
