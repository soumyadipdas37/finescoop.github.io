They left New York to wait out the height of the coronavirus crisis in Los Angeles.

But after returning to the Big Apple earlier this month, Elsa Hosk and Tom Daly are clearly back in their stride in the east coast metropolis.

The Swedish model and the Danish entrepreneur made sure to wear masks as they ran errands together on Monday.

Hosk, 31, wore a long black trench coat which she paired with black leather sandals.

Her blonde hair was severely pulled back from her face and she sported sunglasses.

Daly, on the other hand, opted for a more colorful and relaxed option, pairing a bright red floral-themed shirt with black jeans and red sneakers.

The couple have been dating since 2015 although they knew each other as friends before that.

While she may have returned to NYC, it's not clear if Hosk plans to continue living there or will up sticks and return to the west coast where she hopes to pursue an acting career.

The Victoria's Secret Angel has listed her Soho neighborhood apartment for sale, seeking $3.5 million for the two-bed, two-bath residence. 

The 1,750-square-foot property is located in a pre-war building in Soho’s famous Cast Iron Historic District. 

The apartment boasts a pair of original Corinthian columns, Danish wide-plank Douglas wood floors and exposed brick. 

The master bedroom situated directly above the kitchen sits 'within a steel structure mezzanine level with a wall of operable windows that overlook the loft space,' the listing states.

The open plan layout includes six floor-to-ceiling windows that allow natural light to flood in.
