Christine Lampard was dressed in a lovely monochrome ensemble when she was pictured after a date night with husband Frank on Tuesday. 

The couple, who married in 2015, appeared to still be very much in love as they held hands after dining in upmarket restaurant Roka in Mayfair. 

Christine, 41, tiered a black top with a matching blazer and a tiered cream skirt with black edging.

She carried a black YSL bag across her body and completed her look with strappy black sandals. 

Frank, 42, mirrored Christine's style wearing a smart casual cream knit top with smart navy chinos and trainers. 

He draped a matching navy jacket over his arm as he walked along with his love.   

Christine recently revealed that she has also been following Joe Wicks aka The Body Coach's recipes during the coronavirus pandemic, and has no doubt kept fit running around after her daughter Patricia, 12 months, who she shares with Frank.

TV star Christine recently revealed that she has also been following Joe Wicks aka The Body Coach's recipes during the coronavirus pandemic, and has no doubt kept fit running around after her daughter Patricia, 12 months, who she shares with Frank.

After spending lockdown together, the couple have recently been resuming their work duties.

Christine has been presenting daytime shows Lorraine and Loose Women.

And Frank has been busy rebuilding the Chelsea squad with some big money signings ahead of their first game away to Brighton and Hove Albion.

Frank - who also starred for Chelsea before he turned to coaching - said of his wife: 'She definitely coaches me. And I do throw a lot of things off Christine.

'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home [and ask].

'It's a different view, a different opinion.'
