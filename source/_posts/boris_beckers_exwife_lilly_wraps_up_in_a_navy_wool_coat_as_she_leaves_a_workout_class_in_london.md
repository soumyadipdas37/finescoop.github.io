She recently hit out at her ex-husband Boris' new girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro as she urged her to 'step away from my child'.

And Lilly Becker showed the drama was behind her as she made a low-key exit from a workout class in South London on Thursday.

The model, 44, wrapped up against the autumn chill in a long navy woolen coat as she made her way down the street.

Stepping out: Lilly Becker cut a casual figure as she made a low-key exit from a workout class in South London on Thursday.

Beneath her cosy outerwear, Lilly donned a white hooded and semi-sheer black leggings, while she added a bright pair of orange trainers.

The Dutch beauty swept her curly brunette tresses into a ponytail beneath her black sports cap, while she appeared to go make-up free for the occasion. 

She appeared relaxed as she strolled through the capital while holding on to her water bottle and listening to music via her AirPods.  

Lilly's outing comes after she hit out at estranged husband Boris' girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro after she was seen with her son Amadeus, 10, in Ibiza at the end of July.

Lilian had been seen wrapping her arms around the 52-year-old tennis legend's son while they waded in the ocean earlier this week during their holiday. 

In a now deleted Instagram post, Lilly implored to Lilian: 'Let me put it his way so you understand: during the period of #corona! You're the 2nd girl within 7 months to make breakfast - pizza- pancakes for my son! (sic) 

'No girl - as a mother please respect my son and go take pics with @borisbeckerofficial in your cute bikini and your fabulous body but I beg you step away from my son! (sic)' 

Lilly then requested that Lilian 'take Boris' hand' during the trip rather than try and get close with her son.

Referring to her estranged husband, Lilly went on: 'B won't tell you! But I will otherwise you won't get the message! Have a fab holiday - without touching my kid! He's off limits! Period!!' (sic)

MailOnline contacted Boris' representatives at the time for comment.

The former Wimbledon champion split from model Lilly in 2018 after a 13-year relationship and nine years of marriage, and it is understood that they are in the 'final stages' of divorcing. 

In May 2019, the pair reached an agreement after becoming embroiled in a family court dispute over their son Amadeus. Lilly reflected on 2018 after parting ways from her husband of nine years during an interview with Günther Jauch on Germany's RTL.

She admitted the couple will never rekindle their relationship, insisting: 'It's really over between us. 2018 was the worst time of my 42 years. He so grossly disappointed me.'

Speaking on the negative effects of being in the limelight, she went on: 'What makes it so bad is that everything is happening in public now. But I married a public man, maybe it's part of it.'

'Unfortunately, [a reunion wouldn't] not work anymore. Too much has happened. I do not want to, he does not, and that's fine. It's really over between us.'
