The day before, Alec's wife Hilaria snapped a humorous selfie to share with her hundreds of thousands of followers.

She had her gray zip-up hoodie left open to give Eduardo access to nurse while she brushed her teeth and snapped the photo.

The 36-year-old beauty wrote, '3.5 days in and we are champs at multitasking.'

Although she was reveling in her ability to do multiple things, some social media trolls came after her for spending too much time online while she had a newborn to care for.  

'Good for you ... but TMI... use the focus on yourself and your children now,' read one, while another said: 'Seriously, get off social media and bond with your baby. Do you not get attention at home?'

Shortly afterward, Hilaria posted a lengthy message addressing the digs on her Instagram page.

'Let me be really clear about something: I will post here and there about how we are doing. If you send me a comment telling me how much to post or how little, and I happen to see the message, I will just block you. I’m not interested in those opinions. 5 kids in, we are happy, healthy, bonded, tired, busy, but blessed,' she wrote. 

She reminded her followers that it only takes a short time to post and that she also has friends on the app, not just fans. 

'It’s also my family and friends too and we all want to stay in touch. Especially now, during Covid, when this is how they will meet Edu. I look back to these pics and am always happy to pause and document. I never regret it.' 

Hilaria captioned the post: 'In case you missed my stories and you need clarity here too. As I said there: 45 seconds on this and that is all I’m giving it. Post from here will hopefully just be babies and silliness and love.' 

Hilaria's response: Her post received some comments criticizing her for spending too much time on social media when she had a new baby at home so she posted a clapback
