Prison Break star Dominic Purcell appeared to confirm the show will return for a sixth season on Tuesday.

The actor, 50, took to Instagram to share a cryptic post in which he responded to rumours he had heard, and claimed Prison Break would return despite previous claims another outing wasn't in the works.

Dominic shared a picture of himself, as he explained: 'Rumor number 1. I'm old. Yes. I'm 50.....

Could it be? Prison Break star Dominic Purcell (pictured with Wentworth Miller) 'confirmed' the show WILL be back for a sixth season on Tuesday... despite previous claims it would not return

'Rumor number 2. I'm bald. No I have a full head of hair; the people demand I shave it.

'Rumor number 3, Will season pb 6 happen. Yes..... Rumor number 4. Do I like humans? No. Not on mass. Definitely not.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Fox Entertainment for comment.

Prison Break ran for five seasons with the first four airing between 2005 and 2009, before it was revived in 2017 for another outing.

The gritty drama starred Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield, while Dominic played his brother Lincoln Burrows, and the show focused on Michael's plan to help Lincoln escape prison after he was sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit.

Season five was a sequel set seven years after the original show, and saw Michael return from the dead as he fought to get his identity back and take down Poseidon, the person responsible for his disappearance.

The limited series ended with Michael refusing to join the CIA so that he could live a normal life with his wife Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies) and their son Mike.

Despite Dominic's post, Fox Entertainment's CEO Charlie Collier shot down hopes for a sixth season in August 2019, as he said the channel had 'no plan' to make it.

He explained: 'There's no plan right now to revive Prison Break or any of the other franchises, but when the creators come with a story that they think is the right time to tell, we are so ready to listen because those are some franchises of which I'm so proud and feel so fortunate that they're in our stable.'
