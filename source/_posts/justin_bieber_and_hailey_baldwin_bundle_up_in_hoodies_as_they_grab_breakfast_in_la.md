They're gearing up to celebrate their official second wedding anniversary on September 30.

And Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin appeared to be enjoying married life when the couple grabbed a low-key breakfast together in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The singer, 26, and the model, 23, both rang in the newly arrived Fall season by bundling up in heavy hoodies for the outing.

The What Do You Mean hitmaker paired his large off-white sweatshirt with green sweatpants and white sneakers.

The niece of Alec Baldwin meanwhile showed off her long, toned legs in a pair of skimpy shorts that were all but hidden by her large hooded sweatshirt.

The blonde beauty kept her straight tresses pulled up in a high, taut bun as she strolled with her husband of nearly two years.

Those Justin initially walked away from the couple's vehicle without a mask, he soon thought better of it and covered his face per CDC recommendations.

The pair sat at an outdoor table, and Justin appeared to be posting to his high profile Instagram account.

Later, the post -a bible quote- showed up on Bieber's feed, along with the caption, 'Let’s highlight the main point of the Gospel! IT’S LOVE!'

'Being a Christian doesn’t give you the right to point fingers or judge,' continued the Hillsong devotee. 'It should actually give you more freedom to love better, (more patient, more kind)'. 

'Let’s not miss the main point. Love your neighbor as yourself!' the Sorry singer concluded.

He later posted an Instagram Story from his car in which he played with filters on the social media app.

The Biebers are gearing up to celebrate their official second wedding anniversary on September 30 following an informal picnic on September 13 to celebrate the day they got their marriage license in New York.

The Christian couple - who met at the 26-year-old pop star's 2009 concert meet-and-greet - are now moving into the $25.8M seven-bedroom Beverly Park mansion they bought in August.

Last Friday, Justin debuted the wholesome music video for his new song Holy featuring Chance The Rapper, which references his whirlwind romance with Hailey.

'Running to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy,' Bieber sang.

'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.'
