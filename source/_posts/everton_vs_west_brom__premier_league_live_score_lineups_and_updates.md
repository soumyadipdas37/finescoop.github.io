Everton will look to make it two wins from two when they host Premier League new boys West Brom in the early top-flight action.

Carlo Ancelotti has made some astute signings this summer with the likes of James Rodriguez and Allan joining from huge European clubs and the Toffees made an impressive start to their season by beating Tottenham on the road.

The newcomers didn't receive such a warm welcome back to the top-flight though as they were thumped 3-0 by Leicester. Can they spring a surprise today and get their first three points of the season or will Everton be too strong?

Greetings one and all and welcome to our coverage of the second Premier League weekend of the season.

Once again, the games are spaced out and without overlap to allow for blanket television coverage with fans still unable to get back into grounds.

We begin at Goodison Park watching an Everton side creating quite a buzz following some exciting summer acquisitions, with optimism soaring after last Sunday's 1-0 win at Tottenham in their season opener. 

Today, they host newly-promoted West Bromwich Albion, whose return to the top-flight started in ominous fashion with a 3-0 home loss to Leicester. They'll hope for better here.

Plenty of build-up ahead for what is a 12.30pm kick-off and we will bring you all the team news in a few minutes' time.
