She is the former model and radio host who always puts on a fashionable display.

The presenter, 40, looked radiant in a lemon yellow ruffled blouse and high waisted jeans as she reported for duty on her drive time radio show.

Kelly's pretty shirt featured frills at the shoulder and chest and was tucked into her faded blue jeans.

The beauty boosted her height with a pair of tan heeled sandals, while she carried her essentials in a quilted black handbag.

She swept her brunette locks into a high ponytail for the occasion, while she enhanced her features with a minimal make-up palette. 

Kelly was clearly in high spirits as she flashed a warm smile before making her way into the building.

Kelly's stylish display comes as she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up'.

She also declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March.

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The brunette beauty has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
