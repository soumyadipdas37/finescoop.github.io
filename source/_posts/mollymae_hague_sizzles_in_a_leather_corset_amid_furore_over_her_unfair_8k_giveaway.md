As many social media users branded her technique 'lazy', the influencer claimed she couldn't record all participants on the site without putting her account at risk and urged fans to 'be happy' for the champion, who goes by @joycenotjoy on the platform.

The reality TV star, who opened the competition to celebrate earning one million YouTube subscribers earlier this month, went make-up free as she detailed her selection process.

Molly-Mae said: 'Okay guys the moment is finally here, I'm just going to keep my phone up so you can see, it's totally legit.

'To pick the giveaway winner, we've come up with several ideas, but what we've done is pick 25 random people from the giveaway. We're going to put 1-25 in the generator and whatever number is pulls out, that's going to be the winner!'

'Is it just or me or was the Molly Mae giveaway kinda unfair? Cause she said to enter the giveaway do this and that which 2mil+ did but she only used the random generator on 25 ppl so only they had a chance of winning tbh.. I don’t think this was executed very well.

'Imagine Running a competition that millions of people enter and you can only be bothered to pick up 25 names... well your management @mollymaehague #mollymaegiveaway #mollymae #lazybehaviour  

'How do you get 2mil+ comments on the Molly mae giveaway but then only do the number generator on 25 people??? How is that fair? 







Support: Others said naysayers should be grateful as they insisted the 'sweetheart' has been one of the only celebrities that have created such an impressive giveaway

'what a scam Molly Mae's giveaway was. nearly 3 million entries and she only picks 25 people to put in the random name generator lmfao. 

Others said naysayers should be grateful as they insisted the 'sweetheart' has been one of the only celebrities that have created such an impressive giveaway.

They penned: 'Why are people moaning about how Molly Mae picked the winner Rolling on the floor laughing Stop being so sore and be happy for the girl that won ffs 2 million people entered what did you expect.

'Really baffles me how salty some people are about loosing @mollymaehague giveaway. 1. She did sth most celebs would never do and we should appreciate her for that 2. Be happy for someone else, it really isn’t that hard

'Molly Mae is such a sweetheart idc I’m still keeping my follow.' (sic) 

The TV star stood by her further as she added in a separate post following the backlash: 'For people saying that 25 names in a generator isn't fair... we literally spent all well brainstorming the best way to pick.

'There was no software or app that would allow me to put in two million IG comments without logging in with my insta password which I would never ever do. 

'why am I scrolling through the all the tweets about molly mae and seeing people mad that she only picked from 25 people ... like she still picked those 25 from the 2 million it’s literally not unfair lol ?

'Let's just all be happy for the winner please. It's only a light hearted giveaway. The 25 names had all entered more than one... including the winner. Let's be happy for her! She deserves it.' (sic)
