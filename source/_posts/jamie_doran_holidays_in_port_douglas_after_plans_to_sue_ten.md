Jamie Doran announced his intention to sue Channel Ten over his negative portrayal on Bachelor in Paradise in July.   

And on Thursday, the reality star looked to be letting off some steam while holidaying in Port Douglas, Queensland with pal Jackson Brown.

Dressed in a black muscle tank and matching shorts, the 40-year-old worked on his core strength by utilising a Captain's Chair in a local park.

Jamie kept light on his feet in black flip flops, and concealed his gaze behind dark sunglasses and a purple cap.

When not breaking out into a sweat, the firefighter-turned-FIFO worker strolled the streets of the coastal town with his shirtless pal, Jackson. 

On July 29, Jamie announced he would be taking legal action against Channel Ten and Warner Bros. over his portrayal on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise.

Jamie shared a statement to Instagram, explaining why he had decided to call in his lawyers.

He wrote: 'This is not the news I wanted to post, but I feel I owe this to at least my family, friends, and also fans of The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. 

'After lengthy consideration, I've decided to begin legal proceedings against Network 10 and Warner Bros. Australia.

Online: 'After lengthy consideration, I've decided to begin legal proceedings against Network 10 and Warner Bros. Australia,' Jamie told his Instagram followers 

'I'm not going to comment on this any further for the time being and would appreciate it if people would respect my privacy.' 

In response to Jamie's legal threat, a network spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia on July 29: 'Channel 10 has not received any papers regarding this claim.'

Jamie was portrayed as a 'stage-five clinger' on Bachelor in Paradise this season, and received a similar edit on The Bachelorette last year.
