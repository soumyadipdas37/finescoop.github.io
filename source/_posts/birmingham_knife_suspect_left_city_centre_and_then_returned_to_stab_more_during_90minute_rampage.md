The man suspected of carrying out a murderous knife attack in Birmingham allegedly left the city centre and returned to stab more in a 90-minute rampage that killed a 23-year-old man and wounded seven others, a court has heard. 

Birmingham Crown Court heard allegations today that Zephaniah McLeod, 27, did not remain in the city centre throughout the hour-and-a-half period, during which five separate incidents unfolded. 

Birmingham-born McLeod, from Selly Oak is accused of stabbing to death 23-year-old Jacob Billington, a Sheffield Hallam University graduate intern and drummer, and attempting to kill seven other people in a series of attacks spanning 90 minutes. 

West Midlands Police had previously been criticised for alleged delays in responding to the attacks, which the force's chief constable condemned as 'ill-informed critique'.

Zephaniah McLeod appeared at Birmingham Crown Court today. It is alleged he did not remain in the city centre throughout a 90-minute period on Sunday morning, during which five separate stabbing incidents unfolded

Three people were initially knifed, beginning in Constitution Hill at 12.30am, before attacks were reported in Livery Street and nearby Barwick Street over the next 20 minutes.

Jacob Billington was stabbed while heading back to a hotel after spending a night out with friends

Five other people were then stabbed, including Mr Billington, from Crosby, Merseyside, in attacks in both Irving Street and Hurst Street between about 1.50am and 2am.

Police declared a major incident after Mr Billington, a drummer in a band named The Vedetts, was killed and others wounded, including his old school friend and band-mate Michael Callaghan.

Mr Billington was among a group who were making their way back to their hotel after enjoying a night out while visiting a friend who is studying in the city.

A post-mortem examination concluded he died from a stab wound to the neck.  

Mr Billington's devastated family said in a statement: 'Jacob was the light of our life and we have been devastated by his loss.

'He was a funny, caring and wonderful person who was loved by every single person he met.

'He lit up every room with his boundless energy and witty humour and the loss of such a special person will be felt by all who knew him for years to come. We ask that our privacy is respected during this difficult time.'

Sheffield Hallam University, his alma mater, paid tribute to him as 'warm and enthusiastic'. A spokesman said: 'As a university community we are deeply saddened to learn that a member of our staff was a victim of the major incident in Birmingham over the weekend.

'Jacob was a Sheffield Hallam graduate and had joined the library as a graduate intern, where his warmth and enthusiasm made him a greatly valued member of our team.

'Our thoughts and condolences are with his family, friends and colleagues at this very difficult time. We are providing support to those in our community who have been affected by this tragic incident.'

Forenics and police carried out a search around a property in Selly Oak, Birmingham, on Monday, following the knife rampage on Sunday morning

NHS worker and engineering graduate Mr Callaghan, also 23, was also stabbed in the neck during the attack in Irving Street and remains in a critical condition.

A 22-year-old woman who was knifed four times in the neck in nearby Hurst Street is described as critical but stable.

Another man, Thomas Glassey, who suffered two stab wounds in Barwick Street, is in a serious condition but understood to be recovering.

McLeod, who spoke only to confirm his name and that he could hear the proceedings during the 25-minute hearing, wore a yellow and green jumpsuit for the court appearance.

At times, he could be seen rubbing his temples with both hands, touching his wrist and screwing his eyes closed.

The Recorder of Birmingham, Judge Melbourne Inman QC, remanded McLeod into custody for a further hearing at Birmingham Crown Court next month and set a three-week provisional trial date for February 22 2021.
