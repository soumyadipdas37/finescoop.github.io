Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre has described how the millionaire paedophile and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell fed their victims fruit platters and iced tea to keep them looking 'prepubescent'. 

Giuffre claims she spent two years as a 'sex slave' in Epstein's luxury properties, forced to give him erotic massages and 'tuck him into bed' along with other girls. 

Speaking to the podcast Broken: Seeking Justice, she said Epstein wanted 'tanned bodies, he wanted petite bodies, he wanted prepubescent bodies' among the girls who would 'lay out completely naked' at Epstein's mansions.  

'Jeffrey had us on these ridiculous diets. It was all organic and it was all like shaved salmon on a bed of pilaf or couscous and vegetables,' she said. 

'It was never like carbs, you can't just fill up, they wanted you to look a specific way.'

Julie K. Brown, an investigative journalist credited with bringing some of the claims against Epstein to light, said the financier 'wanted girls who looked young'. 

'Even if they were 18, he wanted girls that looked like they were 14. That was very clear to anyone that did the recruiting for him,' she said.  

Giuffre is trying to extract evidence against Epstein from celebrity chef Adam Perry Lang, who worked for Epstein but says he did not witness any of his crimes. 

She described on the podcast how Perry Lang would make her pizzas when she was 'starving' and drink beer with her on Epstein's private Caribbean island. 

Giuffre described Perry Lang as a 'friend' and called the late-night pizzas a 'small act of rebellion' against the conditions she was allegedly being kept under.    

However, Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly 'reprimanded' the pair when she found out about the small gatherings and 'made sure we weren't talking any more'.  

Giuffre recently wrote a letter to Perry Lang urging him to come forward with any evidence against Epstein. 

'He's gone now, he can't hurt us any more,' she says in the letter. 

'I'm not here to ruin your life. You have so much knowledge of the various people on the planes, in his homes and anywhere you would have been with him. 

'You have the ability and frankly the responsibility to speak now... you could help me on my pursuit of justice.' 

Perry Lang acknowledges that he worked for Epstein but says he was 'unaware' of the late financier's crimes.

Adam Perry Lang (pictured in 2015) worked for Epstein as a chef but denies that he witnessed or knew about any of the paedophile's crimes  

'I never saw sexual activity or nudity, I was never aware of underage girls, I was never told of nor saw any of the depraved acts committed by Epstein and his friends,' Perry Lang said in a statement. 

In a message sent directly to Giuffre he praised her 'fierce advocacy' for Epstein victims and promised to speak to her attorneys. 

Perry Lang's lawyer also said that the chef was in contact with federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating Epstein's accomplices. 

Giuffre's lawyers are also involved in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who is awaiting trial on charges of helping Epstein to recruit and abuse underage girls.  

The lawyers have been arguing for the release of Maxwell's deposition in a lawsuit against Giuffre in 2016.   

Maxwell's lawyers argue that her deposition contained 'intimate, sensitive, and personal information' and that its release would wreck her chances of a fair trial. 

The British socialite, who denies the claims against her, last month pleaded with judges not to 'let the cat out of the bag' by unsealing the documents. 

Giuffre's lawyers responded by saying that other high-profile suspects such as al-Qaeda terrorists and cult leader Charles Manson had been given fair trials.

Quoting from a ruling in the Manson case which ended with the killer being sentenced to life in prison in 1972, Giuffre's lawyers said that massive pre-trial publicity 'does not automatically translate into prejudice'.

Maxwell's trial is scheduled for next July. She was arrested in New Hampshire on July 2 and is being held in a Brooklyn jail after a judge deemed she was a flight risk.  

A grand jury returned a sealed, six-count indictment against Maxwell on June 29, almost a year after Epstein was charged.  

It alleges that Maxwell groomed three unnamed girls, all under the age of 18, in London, New York, Florida and New Mexico between 1994 and 1997. 

She is accused of having befriended them by taking them to the movies or on shopping sprees and 'normalised' abusive behaviour by getting undressed in front of them.   

Maxwell's lawyers have tried to distance their client from Epstein, saying she'd had no contact with him for more than a decade.  

Epstein killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. 

He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge, and completed a 13-month jail sentence now widely considered too lenient.  



Before Epstein's conviction, he and Maxwell had a network of powerful friends including Prince Andrew, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.     

Giuffre claims that she had sex with Andrew in the early 2000s. He denies this.
