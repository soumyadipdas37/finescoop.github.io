Hollywood A-Lister Eva Mendes is calling on Australians to dig deep for sick or seriously injured children after being named ambassador for McHappy Day.

The 46-year-old's newly elected position was announced by McDonald's Australia on Friday, despite being unable to travel Down Under due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eva joins a long line of celebrities to hold the position for Ronald McDonald House Charities Australia - including Katie Holmes, Naomi Watts and Ricki-Lee Coulter, Ada Nicodemou, Benji and Joel Madden, and Ryan Kwanten.

The mother of two shared her excitement with Instagram fans on Friday, stating she was eager to get involved due to a personal connection to the charity. 

'I know this charity personally,' Eva wrote.

'My cousin's child had neuroblastoma and the Ronald McDonald House was incredibly instrumental in getting them through the most horrific time.'

Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer commonly found in the adrenal glands, which are the small glands on top of the kidneys.

'I wish I could be there in Australia (one of my favorite places in the world!) to be a part of this important fundraiser for Ronald McDonald House Charities, which helps keep families together while their seriously ill or injured child undergoes treatment,' she told her fans.

'So excited to help raise money so they can continue to do what they do.'

McHappy Day is the largest annual fundraiser for Ronald McDonald House Charities Australia, raising vital funds to keep families together when a child is seriously ill or injured.

This was specifically important to Eva, who added: 'As a mum, I couldn't imagine being away from my children when they need me most, so I feel so honoured to be involved in such an important initiative.'

'Aussies can get behind the McHappy fundraising efforts by heading to their local McDonald's from the 21st of October and picking up a pair of Silly Socks, a Helping Hand or simply making a donation,' she said.

'And on Saturday 14th of November, McHappy Day, $2 from every Big Mac sold will also go to Ronald McDonald House Charities.'

McDonald's Australia marketing director Jo Feeney said the event had raised more than $51million for RRMHC the past three decades. 

Standing proud: 'As a mum, I couldn't imagine being away from my children when they need me most, so I feel so honoured to be involved in such an important initiative,' Eva said

'These funds have played a vital role in helping the charity keep thousands of families together when they need it most,' she said.

RMHC CEO Barbara Ryan added:  'This year has been especially tough for families of seriously ill or injured children, and as a charity we've had to stretch ourselves and adapt the ways we operate to continue to support these families during this challenging time.

'We are so excited that Eva is lending her voice to McHappy Day ...  The money raised through McHappy Day is critically important to enabling us to continue to do the work we do.'  

Working together: 'Aussies can get behind the McHappy fundraising efforts by heading to their local McDonald's from the 21st of October and picking up a pair of Silly Socks, a Helping Hand or simply making a donation,' Eva said. Pictured: McHappy Day socks
