Australian customers are rushing to get their hands on a budget $9 pina colada fragrance candle from Kmart.

Mum-of-two Chelsea first praised the cheap product on social media which caught the attention of other shoppers online who had also purchased it.

'I am living for this scent right now…I got a few because there weren't many left so I assume it must be popular because I've never spotted it before!' she said.

The candle has a mixed scent of sweet pineapple, coconut and vanilla to resemble the smell and taste of a pina colada.

It also seems to be part of a selection of beverage-inspired scents, as customers can purchase an espresso martini fragrant candle and prosecco fizz candle.

All three candles are priced at $9 each and are available in store or online if stock hasn't sold out prior.

'I am obsessed with that scent and the only candle that smells up the whole house!' one woman said on Facebook.

'Espresso martini is divine!! Best present to give to your girlfriends as a reminder of the good times!' another said.

A third added: 'I love the espresso martini one, the orange one was not all that great but will have to try this one next.'

Some customers who are eager to buy the product say they have been having difficulty finding it in stores

Other social media users said they have never seen the candles in store before and were eager to buy the product for themselves.

'Kmart? Never seen this or espresso martini one, are they new?' one woman asked.

But some customers said they have been having difficulty finding all three candles in stores.
