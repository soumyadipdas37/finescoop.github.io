Throughout the global pandemic, many people have had to rely on technology to stay in touch with their loved ones. 

And Eva Longoria has revealed she is very much in favour of using these methods as she spoke exclusively to MailOnline about connecting with her friends and family during the COVID-19 crisis by enjoying 'wine o'clock on Zoom'.

The Desperate Housewives star, 45, admitted she has forged a deeper connection with her pals, including Victoria Beckham via online means, while also finding solace in her sisters and meditation during the coronavirus pandemic.

Eva, who is mother to two-year-old Santiago with her husband José Bastón, weighed in on how she has empowered her pals during lockdown as she spoke to MailOnline about her work with LaLiga football league and female empowerment. 

She said: 'We have a lot of Wine O'Clock Zooms, with a lot of wine and a lot of Zooms. I almost feel like I've been staying in touch more because I'm not working...

'So I've been in touch more often and connecting more often and having a deeper relationship because the world paused.'

On how she is managing herself, she went to explain she seeks solace in her sisters Esmeralda, Elizabeth and Emily, her girlfriends and in meditation.

She said: 'For me that involves my girlfriends, that means my sisters, more than ever, I need my friends. Meditation, we need to take care of our mental and spiritual health at this time for sure.' 

Eva also spoke of Victoria being her 'best friend' and how Victoria's husband David has helped her in her latest project, in women's football. 

The philanthropic star's chat came in conjunction with her latest project and quest for female empowerment, as she joins the LaLiga football league to help provide visibility to women in the world of sport.

Eva's latest project is a nod to her devotion to the empowerment of women through her sport, which in July 2020, saw her announce the formation of Angel City, the first majority owned and led by women soccer team in Los Angeles.

The star created the Eva Longoria Foundation in 2012, where the ethos is to reduce the educational gap for Latin women, and fight poverty in the Latin community.

Following her collaboration with LaLiga, she revealed David has taken her to many games which helped spark her love further.

She said: 'When David Beckham played for LA Galaxy we went to a lot of games because one of my best friends is Victoria so we went to many games at the stadium all the time and that was a lot of fun...

'And now there's the LA Football Club which is the other team we have in Los Angeles and that stadium is beautiful...

'We went to watch Davids team Inter Miami play against LAFC. They have the most beautiful [stadium] - you feel like your watching a European team because we don't have that football culture in the United States. 

'And that's the first time I've felt the same level of engagement from fans at the LAFC games. I go a lot to the games. I have so many favourite players, such as Messi, Ronaldo, David of course, Sergio Ramos. I like that he's from Andalucia.'

Kick about: She said: 'When David Beckham played for LA Galaxy we went to a lot of games because one of my best friends is Victoria so we went to many games at the stadium all the time and that was a lot of fun'
