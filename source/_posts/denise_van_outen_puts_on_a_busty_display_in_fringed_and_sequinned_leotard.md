She is the stunning television star known for her glamorous ensembles. 

And Denise Van Outen looked sensational as she posed up at her Cabaret All Stars show in London's Proud Embankment Theatre on Monday.

The presenter, 46, put on a busty display in a plunging sequinned and fringed leotard as she brought out her inner showgirl.

The leotard emphasised the star's ample cleavage with the bodice adorned with multicoloured sequins and crystals.

The star showed off her lithe legs in fishnet tights while adding height with vertiginous heels. 

 Her platinum tresses were styled in soft curls while her pretty features were adorned with a rich palette of make-up.

It comes after Denise was also confirmed as one of the stars set to take to the rink for this year's Dancing On Ice.

Denise spoke on Loose Women about her stint on ITV's skating series earlier this week, saying: 'I'm really excited. Finally, I get to tell people. I've kept this a secret from most of my friends and family. Betsy (her 10-year-old daughter) doesn't even know.

'She's at school, so she's going to find out this afternoon when I pick her up from school.. She will be so excited. She loves the show and we watch it every year...

'Literally, I cannot stand up on ice. Every time I've taken Betsy around on a rink I've been the one on the penguin.' 

Go for it: The star posed with a glamorous pregnant pal on the night

Reflecting on things turning around, she went on: 'After the year we've all had it's going to be lovely and refreshing to see a bit of sparkle, a bit of glamour and see us all happy and smiling enjoying ourselves on the ice." 

Last month, it was reported that the mother-of-one has signed up to the upcoming series as a contestant in a staggering £40,000 deal.  

The screen star is understood to have 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month. 

A source told the Daily Star: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'
