Teddi Mellencamp is pictured carrying belongings into her new $6.5 million home in Encino, Los Angeles this week, after news she's been fired from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. 

Teddi, 39, and husband Edwin Arroyave closed this week on the stunning 7 bedroom, 8,550 sq ft property, and the reality star shared clips to her Instagram as the family got settled in on Tuesday.

It seems the fitness guru has a lot to keep her busy as she stays silent on Dailymail.com's exclusive report that Bravo producers have axed her from the series for being 'stale and boring'.

New beginnings: Teddi Mellencamp is pictured moving some of her things into her new house in Encino on Tuesday after closing on the $6.5 million mansion 

Teddi wore comfy gym gear for the moving day and was seen with her hair pulled up in a messy bun.

She teamed a black tank with purple leggings and wore a Gucci belt bag around her waist. 

The new home will be an upgrade for the family , giving them more space than their Hollywood Hills house that the couple put on the market last month for $5.9 million. 

While she hasn't yet addressed the reports that Bravo have dropped her from the reality series, the mother-of-three posted a cryptic quote on Tuesday morning.

The daughter of rocker John Mellencamp talked of being 'frightened about what comes comes next' in an Instagram story.

'If you're feeling frightened about what comes next, don't be. Embrace the uncertainty. Allow it to lead you places,' the quote read. 'Be brave as it challenges you to exercise both your heart and your mind as you create your own path toward happiness.

'Don't waste time with regret. Spin wildly into your next action. Enjoy the present, each moment, as it comes, because you'll never get another one quite like it. And if you should ever look up and find yourself lost, simply take a breath and start over.

The quote ended with the words, 'Retrace your steps and go back to the purest place in your heart … where your hope lives. You'll find your way again.' 

The daughter of rocker John Mellencamp has been on RHOBH for three seasons after joining in 2017. 

The 10th season came to a close last week with the final reunion show.

A production insider has told DailyMail.com: 'Teddi will be advised this week that she will not be picked up for another season.'

Bravo refused to comment when contacted by DailyMail.com.

'The network has not been impressed with her performance on the show,' the insider continued. 'They considered cutting her last season but gave her one last chance.’

'She is boring and stale and does not offer anything to the franchise with her robotic and staged delivery when interacting with the other cast members.'

'The issue is, the other cast members don't particularly like her and beyond Kyle [Richards] no one is friends with her.

'Kyle will most likely dump her, when Bravo does.'

It seems that Teddi's off-camera pursuits have also raised questions about her suitability to be on the show.

A production insider told Dailymail.com Teddi 'is boring and stale and does not offer anything to the franchise with her robotic and staged delivery when interacting with the other cast members.'

The TV star defended her All In weight loss program in an Instagram video posted last week, after receiving criticism over the program's restrictive nature and alleged aggressive attitude of the brand's coaches.

The insider added: 'The network has been less than impressed with the war she is in with influential Instagrammer Emily Gellis.

'It is concerning that she is pushing a business that young women, Bravo's key audience, are claiming is unhealthy and downright dangerous.'

'Regardless of how much Teddi begs to keep her job when she is told, the network will not change their mind. She's done.'
