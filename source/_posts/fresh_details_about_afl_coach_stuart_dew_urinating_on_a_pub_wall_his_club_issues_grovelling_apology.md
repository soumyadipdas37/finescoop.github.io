Fresh details have emerged about a shocking video showing AFL coach Stuart Dew urinating outside a Gold Coast nightclub, which the club claims is two years old.

Dew, 41, was videoed outside the Miami Tavern Shark Bar urinating against a wall while out with fellow senior members of the Gold Coast Suns staff. 

The video surfaced just hours after his side's final game of the severely interrupted 2020 season.

The Gold Coast Suns issued a stern warning to employees involved in the filming, as well as Dew, and said the video was from 2018.

Dew and the club made a grovelling apology for the video on Monday night.

'We apologise for our actions for which there is no excuse and we take full responsibility for our behaviour,' Dew said in the statement.

'The behaviour that took place and the filming and distribution of the footage was not appropriate and we have taken responsibility for what has happened,' Suns General Manager of Football Jon Haines said.   

Both Dew and Haines are both donating $5,000 each to programs supported by AFL Cape York, which provides education, employment and training for young Indigenous men. 

Dew was reportedly filmed urinating by a colleague before the video was shared to a WhatsApp group and eventually wound up online, The Courier Mail reports.

The morning after the video was shot the staffer reportedly realised his mistake and asked everyone in the WhatsApp group to delete it - but it was already too late.

After finishing relieving himself, Dew turns to the camera and smiles awkwardly

Several AFL players have been sent home from Queensland for breaching COVID-19 rules

The former Port Adelaide and Hawthorn champion took over as coach of the battling team at the beginning of 2019 and has widely been praised for developing the side. 

Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been criticised for allowing the AFL to set up private hubs in the state, after a series of scandals.

Richmond Tigers pair Sydney Stack and Callum Coleman-Jones were sent home and banned for 10 weeks after getting into a fight outside a strip club.

The AFL is also currently investigating Harley Bennell for a potential breach of strict COVID-19 rules that were agreed upon so the league could set up in the state.
