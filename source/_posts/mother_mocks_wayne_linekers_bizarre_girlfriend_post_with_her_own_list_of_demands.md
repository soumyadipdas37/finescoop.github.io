A single mother who thinks men are intimated by her success and how much she earns has mocked Wayne Lineker's viral list of requirements for future girlfriends by releasing her own tongue-in-cheek criteria. 

Kerrie Berrie, 36,  of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, took to Instagram to release her light-hearted list with requirements including 'having a six-pack', making dinner every night and loving chick flicks. 

She added: 'You must feel comfortable with having a partner that is more successful and earns more than you.'

The mother-of-one said she was spurred into action after feeling irritated by Lineker's list of demands, which has since gone viral, particularly his suggestion that a future girlfriend should 'give up her career'. 

The request struck a nerve, with Kerrie admitting she thinks men struggle with dating successful women. The bid manager did not reveal her exact salary but said it is more than £45,000. 

Kerrie Berrie, 36, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, has mercilessly parodied Wayne Lineker's infamous girlfriend ad with her own bid for a 'younger Adonis'

 Kerrie added in the post that her new boyfriend would need to 'enjoy the gym and go everyday' and also have to cooker her dinner

Kerrie said: 'I'm single and it's terrible - we women are expected to do everything. Guys don't message first, guys can't carry a conversation. I get asked the rudest questions.

'There is an element of truth in my parody as well because either you can't earn as much as the guy or they think you're there taking his money. It's such double standards. I think men need to look at what they offer. That's really lacking at the moment.

'I'm not super successful but I do alright for myself. I have a nice house, I have a nice car, and my child is grown up. I do go to the gym and keep myself in shape, so they need to bring something to me as well.

'I'm happy in myself and I don't need them. I would like a partner, but they need to bring something back to me as well. It has to be 50/50.'

In the bizarre criteria posted on Instagram last week, Wayne stipulated his future girlfriend had to 'give up her career, not want children, be able to cook ready meals, love R&B music and not watch chick flicks'.

Wayne added in his post that his ideal woman had to 'like older men but only me' and also needed to be a 'worldie and above 30'

But Kerrie's own post asked her potential partner to be comfortable with her success, love her dogs, know the difference between 'there, they're and their' and tickle her hair when watching films together.

You must be an Adonis over 6ft with a massive knob and younger than me, not my age because that would look weird!

You must feel comfortable with having a partner that is more successful and earns more than you. Don’t worry though if you are a good boy I will give you an allowance and I will insure you on my Land Rover so you can drive a big car.

No baggage as my daughter is grown up now. But you must love my dogs, Evie & Bowie, like they are your own children.

You MUST be Educated enough to know when to use their, there and they’re. You MUST never use LOL or LMAO unless your arse literally falls off your body and onto the floor.

You have to enjoy the gym and go everyday. Having a six pack is vital because I want something nice to look at whilst you cook me dinner after a hard day at work. You can’t be obsessed with yourself or over confident though because that’s just so unattractive. When we settle down for some Netflix’s don’t moan about the chick flicks....if you wanna watch another action film then go to your mates, but not too often...maybe once a month? We can negotiate that. I’ll expect my back tickled and my hair played with whilst we are watching the film.

With 362 followers on instagram and 251 followers on tiktok, you’ll need to accept that I HAVE to reply to men’s messages as well as girls on all social platforms.

Parodying Wayne's demands for 'body definition' on his ideal partner, unimpressed Kerrie asked for hers to be 'an Adonis over six feet'.

Kerrie wrote: 'I've not had much luck with the dating sites as we all know, so inspired by @waynelineker latest post here are my requirements.

'Let's start off like I'm normal...strong, nice loving personality. Now onto the more important things... You must feel comfortable with having a partner that is more successful and earns more than you.

'Don't worry though if you are a good boy I will give you an allowance and I will insure you on my Land Rover so you can drive a big car.

'No baggage as my daughter is grown up now. But you must love my dogs, Evie & Bowie, like they are your own children.'

She added: 'Ohhh and one last thing this is obviously a joke!!' 

Speaking after sharing her post, Kerrie said she had grown tired of receiving sexist and rude comments from men on dating apps.   

Kerrie said: 'The people who know me well know how ridiculous my post is. They know I'm quite a feminist and I'm all about equal rights, but I've had the worst luck dating.

'I sometimes think my friends think I'm being too fussy and that's why I haven't found someone, but I'm not. There are complete weirdos out there.

'I think some of these men need to have the treatment Wayne Lineker got and feel a bit embarrassed.  

'My friends think [Wayne's post] was all done tongue and cheek to start with, but knowing men I think at first it was genuine and then obviously he got called out and got embarrassed and had to backtrack a bit. The woman he wants doesn't exist. She's not out there. 

Kerrie claims she receives inappropriate messages from potential dates all the time - including a man who asked her if she'd rather 'kneel or squat when giving him a b***job'.

One stranger messaged her on Instagram to 'ask permission to masturbate with your picture', while another announced he would never date her as she 'was obsessed with bodybuilders and gym bodies'.

'I was talking to a guy and we seemed to be on the same page morally and about what we want in the future.

'It was going quite well and there were back and forth messages for a couple of hours. Then he said, 'when you give a b***job, do you squat or kneel?'.

Kerrie shared a banana milkshake with Gary Lineker's brother Wayne when they met in Ibiza six years ago and had followed him on Instagram ever since - until she saw his post last week

While she admits Wayne's post was a joke, Kerries says there is an element of truth as she believes men can't handle women who earn the same or more than them

'The only way to date nowadays is to be on the apps. To be on the app you have to put up with the daily crap that men spout at you. You just wouldn't do it in real life.

'If you wouldn't say it to a woman in real life face-to-face, then my advice is don't say it. If you wouldn't want your mum or sister to know what you've just said to a woman, definitely don't say it.

'I have now spelt it out on my Tinder bio. I feel like you have to spoon-feed men.'
