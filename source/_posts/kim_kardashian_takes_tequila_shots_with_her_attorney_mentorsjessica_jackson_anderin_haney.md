Kim Kardashian has added several notches to her belt since rising to fame as a socialite on her hit E! reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2009.

And the 39-year-old aspiring lawyer, who is currently aiming to take the bar exam in 2022, put an adult twist on her study session on Wednesday night.

'Tequila & Torts! Was tonight's theme!' captioned Kardashian as she took celebratory tequila shots with her attorney mentors Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney.

Kim documented the entire tequila-filled fun on her Instagram Story, despite her obvious aversion to taking shots.

'This is how we study,' began the KKW Beauty founder, before telling her lawyer pals that she 'needs a chaser' for her shot.

The ladies, with full shot glasses in hand, gathered around as Kim uttered some encouraging words.

'Cheers to studying for law school and passing this f**king test once and for all,' she concluded.

Kardashian could not help but laugh at herself as she struggled to consume the pungent liquor.

'I'm such a p***y!' she shouted, while sipping away on her chaser. 'Oh my God! I have way too much taste of that.'

In a follow up video, taken in selfie mode, Kim sipped on her lime-infused drink and repeated her celebratory toast for her 189million followers on Instagram.

She then raised up a bottle of Don Julio tequila that was gifted to her for her birthday last year.

'This must have been from last year...1942,' said Kim as she read the bottles label before slamming it down on the counter top and ending the Instagram Story video.

In her final post of the night, the KUWTK star encouraged her followers to weigh in on what she, Erin, and Jessica should name their study session.

'Tequila and torts...Cocktails and contracts...Crunk and crim...' she listed, followed by a laughing face emoji.

Kim began a four-year apprenticeship at a law firm in San Francisco in 2018 and is working under Erin Haney and Jessica Jackson to complete her law studies, according to NBC.

Kardashian often documents her rigorous study sessions, which involve plenty of extensive note taking, on her Instagram Story.

But Wednesday evening's session proved to be a real treat for Kim and her renown mentors.

In March, she spoke of how becoming a mother prompted her to begin her apprenticeship.

Speaking to Grazia, the beauty, who is a little more than a year into a four year law course, said: ‘Becoming a mom has really opened up my heart, and it’s changed me. 

‘I don’t know if this journey would have happened for me before I was a mom. I will do what I can to help keep on shouting the stories of these people I’ve met.’

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she was 'prideful' that she could set an example for her children through her work and that a 'big part' of life should be giving back.
