Thom Yorke has married his girlfriend of three years Dajana Roncione in Sicily, four years after the death of his ex-partner Dr Rachel Owen.

The Radiohead singer, 51, and Italian actress, 36, tied the knot on Saturday at the 18th century villa Valguarnera in Bagheria, reports Italian Vanity Fair.

During the celebrations, the happy couple ensured all COVID-19 rules were followed meaning they didn't have a dance floor and provided masks to their '120 guests'.

It is thought that Thom's Radiohead bandmates - Jonny and Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien and Philip Selway - were all invited to the stunning Sicilian wedding.

As well as making sure guests didn't mingle too closely on the dance floor, Thom and Dajana also had their catering staff take Covid tests, reports La Repubblica.

Speaking ahead of the nuptials, Thom told Vanity Fair: 'Despite all the difficulties caused by the global pandemic, we are proud and happy to get married here in Sicily. Sicily is Dajana's native island.' 

The musician added that he hoped: 'In these strange times our wedding can be a small celebration, with our friends and family, of Sicilian culture and its way of life.'

Pictures shared by photographer Greg Williams from the happy couple's big day show them relaxing in a stunning room which boasts a huge chandelier.

Thom and Dajana were first linked in 2017 and were seen hitting the beach in Miami that March, three months after the death of his ex-partner of 23 years, Dr Rachel Owen.

Artist Dr Owen, who Thom shared children Noah and Agnes with, passed away aged 48, following a battle with cancer. 

At the time Pembroke College Oxford, where Dr Owen was a retained lecturer, released a statement paying tribute.

It said: 'It is with great sadness that the College marks the death of Dr Rachel Owen.

'Despite her declining health from cancer in the last year, she asked to continue to teach, which she did right until the end of last Michaelmas term. She was 48 years old and leaves behind a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, aged 15 and 12.

'One of her latest artistic productions was a series of prints inspired by the Cantos of Dante's first book of the Divine Comedy. The prints will be exhibited at Pembroke's JCR Art Gallery during Trinity term.' 

Dajana was the first person the Radiohead singer dated since splitting from his long-term former partner Dr Owen in 2005, after 23 years together. 

The Italian actress later appeared in Thom's ANIMA short film in 2019. The piece has been described as 'mind-bending' and was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. 

Most recently, Dajana has worked on La Concessione del Telefono while Thom has hinted that Radiohead might be considering a 2021 tour, reports NME.
