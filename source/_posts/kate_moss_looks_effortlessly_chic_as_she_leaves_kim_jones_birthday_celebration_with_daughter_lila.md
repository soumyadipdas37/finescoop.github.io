A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together. 

'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.

'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'

After attending a week-long detox in Turkey back in June 2015, the runway sensation wound up being escorted off an easyJet flight home after her airport drinking session took a heavy turn.

Last month she told Elle: 'I hit the sack at 11pm-ish and watch Netflix before I go to sleep. I deal with stress by doing yoga. It helps me concentrate on the here and now.'
