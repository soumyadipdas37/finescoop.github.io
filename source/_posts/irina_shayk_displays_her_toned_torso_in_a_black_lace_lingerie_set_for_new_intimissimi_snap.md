Rumours: It comes after Irina and art dealer Vito Schnabel continued to spark relationship rumours over the weekend 

'Irina has known Vito for years and they've always been friends. They used to double date when Vito was with Heidi and Irina was with Bradley,' they explained.

Quarantine left the pair plenty of free time to spend together, according to the insider who added: 'Now, they are both single and quarantined in New York.'

'Vito is a big flirt and Irina is his type. She likes the attention. They are neighbours and are spending a lot of time together. When Irina's daughter is with Bradley [Cooper], she has downtime and she likes the company.' 

Irina and Bradley Cooper began dating in 2015 but split in June 2019. The duo share and co-parent daughter Lea, three.
