Women are now submerging their faces in water after they have applied their makeup, in a Korean technique known as 'jamsu' - which promises a flawless, lasting look.

'Jamsu', which loosely translates as 'to submerge', is designed to help tackle oily skin by making the skin matte, and it also claims to make your makeup transfer-proof to ensure an even and long-lasting look.

To try the technique, all you need to do dunk your face in a bowl of cool water after applying your makeup for 15-20 seconds.

Keep your eyes shut while you rest and 'set' you face, before you remove it from the bowl and pat it lightly with a dry face towel, taking care not to remove any of your foundation, concealer or loose powder.

The reason why the technique works is because cold water is known to shrink your pores and create a matte effect on the skin.

Cold water can also help to 'set' your makeup, and enables your skin to blend seamlessly with any foundation or tinted moisturiser.

Those who have tried the beauty approach online have revealed how great they find it for making their skin look flawless.  

'Trying out the jamsu makeup technique,' one woman posted on Instagram.

'It means diving or submerging and is basically combining the baking technique and submerging your face in cold water to seal your makeup for a flawless look.'

She added: 'It's perfect for a no-makeup-makeup look'.  

Another commenter said the approach has transformed her entire work-day look, and means she never needs to touch up her makeup.

This isn't the first time a Korean beauty trick has wowed the internet.

Previously, skincare devotees around the globe started washing their faces with sparkling mineral water rather than regular tap.

Originally from Japan, but popularised in Korea, this claims to be a skin miracle worker because it purifies the skin after cleansing and firms the overall appearance of your complexion.

'Some spas... have used carbonated water to treat the skin,' Alicia Yoon of Korean beauty site Peach & Lily said.

'Sometimes it's soaking the face in this water, or the aesthetician may recommend soaking cotton pads with carbonated mineral water and dabbing them onto the skin (no tugging or rubbing) after cleansing.'

She continued: 'The idea is that instead of using just plain mineral water, they use carbonated water as well, creating a treatment that is even more nourishing and beneficial.'

The benefits of switching your evening facial wash to sparkling are myriad.

Not only does the mineral water 'help keep the cells between collagen fibres strong', but it also aids the 'overall firmness and plumpness of the skin', said Alicia.

Sparkling water also helps to wash out the pores without too much harshness, and it helps the efficacy of your other skincare products.
