David James has sensationally predicted that Arsenal will become surprise winners of the Premier League title this season.

Having missed out on Champions League football last year, despite Mikel Arteta managing to steady the ship after Unai Emery's departure, the north London club will be targeting a top four charge this time around.

But former Liverpool and England goalkeeper James believes a rejuvenated Arsenal will be able to defy all the odds and go one step further by clinching the trophy for the first time in 16 years.

David James tipped Mikel Arteta and Arsenal to be shock Premier League winners this season

The former Liverpool goalkeeper has praised Arteta's work since he replaced Unai Emery

In an interview with The Gary Newbon Sport Show on Punching.TV, James said: 'I just think with Arsenal, what Arteta was doing, or trying to implement last season and they started doing, he's had more time to get his team working well. 

'They looked fantastic against Fulham, arguably you would expect them to win. 

'I think Arteta's got an opportunity with a gifted squad to go all the way. There's no reason why they can't do it, other than Manchester City and Liverpool reproducing the sort of form they've been doing over the last two years.'

Arsenal began the new campaign with a win at Fulham and James says they can go all the way

It has been widely expected that both recent winners will go on to do battle at the summit again during this campaign. 

Liverpool were able to edge past Leeds in their opening day fixture to overcome the first hurdle in the defence of their crown, while City begin their challenge with a clash against Wolves next Monday.

James, however, believes that the Anfield giants may fall short this year - and has been drawn to tipping Arsenal due to their newfound and free-flowing style of play.

Liverpool may fall short in their bid to retain their first title in three decades, James believes

The style of play and mentality instilled by Arteta have been particularly praised by James 

'As everyone knows, winning the league is not easy,' he added. 'Winning the league twice is very, very difficult. When Liverpool have had almost two perfect seasons, you wonder whether they can reproduce that. 

'As a football follower I just like what Arteta's doing and I think they've got the chance.'

Arteta has attempted to instil a winning mentality since taking his first steps into management and his approach has paid dividends. 

Arsenal were handed a further boost when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang signed a new contract

The club lifted the FA Cup last term after defeating Chelsea in the final, and also ensured the start of the current season got off to the best possible start with their triumph in the Community Shield. 

Talismanic captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang recently confirmed he has pledged his future at the Emirates after finally penning a new three-year deal worth £350,000-a-week in a further boost.

Arsenal are also expected to remain active in the transfer market before it slams shut on October 5, although whether they will be able to live up to James' sky-high expectations remains to be seen.
