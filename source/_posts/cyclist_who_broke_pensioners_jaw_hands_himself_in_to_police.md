A cyclist who allegedly left a pensioner with a broken jaw in a road rage attack has handed himself into police. 

Graeme Gibb, 76, was allegedly punched by a lycra-wearing cyclist while en route to his weekly Sunday walk at Burleigh Waters on the Gold Coast. 

On Friday, a 46-year-old man was charged with one count of serious assault after he handed himself to police.

The cyclist took himself to the station after a photograph of him and his grey Trek bicycle was shared hundreds of times on social media.

Mr Gibb said he holds no ill will to his alleged attacker, despite claiming the ordeal could have been fatal. 

'In reality he could have killed me, I could have fallen down, hit my head on the concrete, I could have had a brain malfunction,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

The great grandfather feared for his family if he didn't survive the alleged attack.

'I have three children and ten grandchildren and three great grandchildren and they are all young and to lose their pa, their grandpa, their father and their great grandfather,' he said. 

'They would have to live the rest of their lives without me.'

Mr Gibb is not allowed to eat solid foods for at least six weeks and if his broken jaw doesn't heal he will be forced to get screws and metal plates put in. 

He has been making good use of his blender since he isn't able to chew anymore. 

'The police told me to save every single receipt that you've got because he's going to be paying for it,' Mr Gibb said.

Mr Gibb said he did not fight back at the cyclist during the alleged ordeal.  

'I didn't have any anger. I never even picked up my hand to him. I didn't even touch him, so it's kind of sad,' he said.   

Mr Gibb has since become friends with the woman who photographed the alleged culprit.  

The chain of events unfolded after Mr Gibb made an offhand comment to two cyclists travelling along the road.

He was driving from his gym session to the Miami Hotel car park when he came across the cyclists taking up the lane.

Mr Gibb's daugher Alisha said she is thankful for the community support following the alleged assault 

He leaned out the window and called out to them.

'I said why don't you guys cycle in a single lane?' he said.

Mr Gibb passed the cyclists but when he parked his vehicle in the car park, he was approached by one of the riders. 

'They kind of looked threatening to me... and then I just got an almighty whack to the chin, and down on the knees I went,' he said.  

Bystanders surrounded the accused and snapped his photo before he allegedly fled on foot.  

Before taking off, the cyclist allegedly picked up the retiree's car keys and hurled them on top of the roof at Dan Murphy's.

Mr Gibb's daugher Alisha said she is thankful for the community support following the alleged assault.  

'Nobody deserves to be treated by someone the way my Dad did, especially at his age,' she told the Courier Mail.

'It's overwhelming the amount of people who jumped in so quickly to help him.

'I'm very pleased ... that my Dad can now move on from this and recover.' 



The 46-year-old will face Southport Magistrates Court on September 25. 

Mr Gibb is not allowed to eat solid foods for at least six weeks and if his broken jaw (pictured) doesn't heal he will be forced to get screws and metal plates put in
