Alessandra Ambrosio has been hitting the beach over the last few days marking the end of summer and the beginning of fall.

And on Wednesday the former supermodel was back at it again when she soaked in another gorgeous sunset during the golden hour in Malibu.

The Brazilian-born beauty, 39, could be seen snapping photos and taking quick video of the sunset as she walked through the sand and frolicked a few feet into the ocean water.

Ambrosio showed off her fabulous figure in a peach-colored bikini that was paired with a matching vest.

Several buttons of the vest were left undone, which gave more than a hint of her cleavage and toned midriff. 

By the time the sun was going down, the longtime Victoria's Secret Angel used her stylish sunglasses to help pulled her brown tresses off of her face.

The previous day, the mother of two headed out to the beach, not far from her coastal home, and documented another beautiful sunset on her Instagram page.

'Sunset of the day,' she wrote across one snap taken as the sun fell in the horizon, leaving a stunning glow on the shoreline.    

Ambrosio also posted some images of herself throwing around a volleyball with the gorgeous sunset in the background.

Over the summer months, the GAL Floripa lifestyle brand co-founder has made a habit out of playing beach volleyball with friends and family whenever she finds the time.

Ambrosio has been quarantining at her home in nearby Brentwood during the COVID-19 pandemic with her two children, Anja, 12, and Noah, eight, whom she shares with her former fiancé Jamie Mazur.
