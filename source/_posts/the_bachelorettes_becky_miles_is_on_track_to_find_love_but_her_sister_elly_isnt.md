The source added: 'Unlike Elly, who loves to be the centre of attention, no one really knew who Becky was, but she really surprised everyone.'

The insider also claimed 'there was some jealously between the sisters' as Elly is used to being 'in the spotlight'.

'While Elly is used to the spotlight, Becky definitely stole it and there was a bit of jealousy.'
