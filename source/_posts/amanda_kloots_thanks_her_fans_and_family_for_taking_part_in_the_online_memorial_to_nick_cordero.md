Exactly two months after Broadway star Nick Cordero passed away due to COVID-19 complications, his wife Amanda Kloots thanked her fans and family for their support.

An online memorial was streamed live on BroadwayOnDemand.com on Sunday afternoon, celebrating Kloots' late husband, who passed in July at just 41 years of age.

After the memorial, Kloots, 38, took to her Instagram to share her heartfelt thanks for everyone who tuned into the memorial.

Kloots shared a photo on Instagram on Sunday evening, featuring a number of friends such as Sydney Morton, Preston Boyd, Molly Tuttle, Trevor Tuttle, Jessie Weiss and Cary Brothers watching the memorial.

'I’m very grateful for Nick’s memorial tonight. I’m grateful that so many people from Nicks life were a part of it,' Kloots began.

'I’m grateful that people learned things about Nick they didn’t know, got a glimpse into his childhood, early adult years and then these last special years. I’m grateful that Elvis will have this video to watch one day to learn about his father, about how many people loved him and the lives he touched,' Kloots continued.

She added that she found many 'silver linings' tonight, adding they couldn't have a 'huge celebration' due to COVID-19, but now they have a 'video for a lifetime. 

'Tonight so many people could watch and learn about Nick’s life that may not have been able to travel to wherever we would have held a ceremony,' Kloots explained. 

'Tonight I was in the comfort of my own home, surrounded by dear friends and Elvis able to ugly cry and breathe when I needed. Hooray for silver linings!' she added.
