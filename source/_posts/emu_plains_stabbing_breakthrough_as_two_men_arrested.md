Police arrested a 26-year-old man at a McCauley Crescent home, in Emu Plains, and a 22-year-old man at a Monica Avenue home, in Hassall Grove, on Friday. 

They will allege both men gave police false and misleading information about the events leading up to the 23-year-old man's death. 

Both men have been charged with concealing information about a serious indictable offence and hindering an investigation into a serious indictable offence.

They were refused bail and will front Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday.
