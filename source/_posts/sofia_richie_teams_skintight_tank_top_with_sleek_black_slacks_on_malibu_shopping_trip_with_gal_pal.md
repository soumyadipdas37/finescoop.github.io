Sofia Richie demonstrated her street style as she stepped out for a shopping trip in Malibu with a gal pal on Thursday.

The 22-year-old daughter of Lionel Richie emphasized her trim figure in a fitted grey tank top and pulled on a pair of black slacks.

Letting her blonde hair fly free, she accessorized with a pair of black shades and added a pop of color with a bubblegum pink mask.

The half-sister of Nicole Richie also threw in a splash of dazzle to the look with a glittering necklace and a couple of bracelets.

Sofia wore a fashionable powder blue shade of nail polish and rounded off her relaxed ensemble with a pair of open-toed sandals.

Her latest leggy outing comes a day after she was seen embracing a male pal in Malibu in the wake of her reported split from her beau of two years Scott Disick.

The 37-year-old reality TV dreamboat shares three children with his friendly ex Kourtney Kardashian whom he last broke up with in 2015.

This May Scott checked into rehab for 'emotional issues' and 'past traumas,' but checked out shortly thereafter. 

In the wake of his decision to leave rehab Us Weekly reported he and Sofia were 'on a break until Scott straightens himself out more.'

Finally on May 27, the day after his 37th birthday, the magazine revealed that Scott and Sofia had decided to end their romance.

Sofia was seen spending time with Scott in July and there were rumors they may have reignited their relationship.

The dynamic duo spent Independence Day together and a People source said in mid-July that they are 'trying to make things work while taking things slow.'

But in early August an Us Weekly source: 'Scott and Sofia have simmered down a little and Scott has been making a big effort to refocus on himself and his family.'

By mid-August an E! News insider said: 'They have been off and on for two months. Sofia really pushed to make things work between them after they initially broke up, but Scott officially called it off recently and they are no longer speaking.'

Meanwhile a source recently told TMZ that Scott and Kourtney 'are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia.' 

Dampening hopes of a reunion even further the insider shared: 'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both.'
