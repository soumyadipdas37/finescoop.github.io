She helped put the 'super' in 'supermodel' en route to becoming one of the top earning models many times over during her illustrious career.

Alessandra Ambrosio is back, gracing the cover and page of yet another high fashion magazine; only this time she's sharing the spotlight with her 12-year-old daughter Anja and eight-year-old son Noah.

And on Monday, September 28, the Brazilian-born beauty took to her Instagram page to give her 10.2 million followers a glimpse at some of the photos from her shoot for the October edition of Elle Russia.

 Shifting into the vibration of love. ¿¿¿¿¿¿

Ambrosio first shared a photo showing the trio dressed in matching olive-green ensembles as they appeared to strike yoga poses.

'A family where life begins and love never ends!!! @elle_russia @anjalouise.a.m & @noahphoenixx BY @gregswalesart,' she gushed in the caption.

The proud mother can be seen standing on one foot with her right arm reaching above her head, while in-between her two children.

Anja is stretching out on floor in front of her mom while Noah does a semi-split to her right.

By Monday afternoon, Ambrosio posted the cover photo showing herself standing against a wooden wall as she has her right arm around her boy.

He is looking up towards his mother while in a prayer position dressed in what appears to be stylish grey sweatpants and a matching long-sleeve shirt.

The longtime Victoria's Secret Angel stared into the camera decked out in a chic white outfit consisting of stylish shorts, matching top and jacket.

By Monday evening Ambrosio shared a series of three photos showing herself and Anja striking leggy poses behind a pole wearing blush-colored outfits.

The former catwalk queen's number had an added dose of sex appeal with its plunging design.

The mother-daughter duo both wore their dark brown tresses long and flowing with a part slightly off to one side.

By night's end, the Gal Floripa brand co-founder shared a close-up selfie snap of herself, seemingly lying in bed, on her Insta-Story with the headline: 'Goodnight'
