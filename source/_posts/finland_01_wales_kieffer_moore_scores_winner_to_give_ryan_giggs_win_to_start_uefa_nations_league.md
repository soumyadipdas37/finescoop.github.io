Forget the circus that followed Gareth Bale to the desolate surrounds of Helsinki’s Olympic Stadium, this trip represented a chance for Ryan Giggs to blood more potential Welsh heroes of tomorrow.

Bale, ostracised at Real Madrid and teasing a Premier League return, enjoyed a first competitive start for more than two months.

But the captain lasted only 45 minutes, having rubbed his thigh. Without him, Daniel James and striker Kieffer Moore combined to stretch Wales’ unbeaten run to seven matches.

As the game fizzled towards stalemate, Moore turned home James’s low cross to settle a largely lifeless Nations League opener against Finland.

With his squad ravaged by injuries to the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and David Brooks, Giggs stuck to his promise of experimentation. 

He handed debuts to Liverpool’s Neco Williams and Manchester United midfielder Dylan Levitt as Wales began their long run-up to the postponed European Championships.

There were signs of vulnerability and promise in a first outing since they secured a place at Euro 2020.

This young squad should benefit from an extra year of experience but with the pace of Bale and James they already have enough to hurt any team.

Inside five minutes, James raced clear and crossed for Moore, whose header was ruled out for a foul.

Then James’s cross-cum-shot was parried towards Bale, who couldn’t quite gather.

Finland did grow into the game and they had a first-half goal ruled out, too, this time for offside against Joni Kauko.

Only the post saved Wales shortly after the break when Sauli Vaisanen hit the woodwork from a couple of yards out, the goal gaping.

Fortunately for Wales, Moore made no such mistake when his late chance came.
