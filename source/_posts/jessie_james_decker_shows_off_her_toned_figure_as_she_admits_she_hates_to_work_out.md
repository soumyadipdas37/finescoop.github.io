Jessie James Decker has one of the most toned bodies on Instagram.

But the 32-year-old country singer shared on Monday that even though she works out every day to look her best, she really doesn't like hitting the gym.

'Gonna be honest... I hate working out. I dread it. I’m one of those girls that watches the clock and counts down to the last second when I can be done,' said the beauty who has been married to former American football wide receiver Eric Decker since 2013. 

She does it to stay healthy: Jessie James Decker has one of the most toned bodies on Instagram. But the 32-year-old country singer shared on Monday that even though she works out every day to look her best, she really doesn't like hitting the gym

'I wish I enjoyed it. I wish I was a big workout junkie but the truth is I just don’t!'

The mother of three then added: 'I do know that in order to achieve a strong body that I want to have and maintain I MUST put the hard work into it.'

And people come to her for advice often: 'Everyone asks me all the time what kind of work out I do and what I eat. As far as work outs I’ll be real, I hate running so I don’t do much of that.'

Decker then said: 'I do enjoy lifting weights and quick circuit training. I love the stairmaster, I love nice long walks (lunges are key, I do 100 at a time). I work out a few times a week and usually no more than 40 minutes time.'

Her truth: 'I wish I enjoyed it. I wish I was a big workout junkie but the truth is I just don’t!' she said to her followers

'But the biggest factor is watching what I EAT and making sure whatever I’m putting in my body is going to make me feel strong and energized.'

The author then shared: 'I’m really excited to share that in my cookbook @justfeedme I have an ENTIRE chapter on what I eat in a day and recipes to share with you on what it is I eat on a daily basis to maintain. 

'It’s high protein low carbs and these recipes are absolutely delicious that you won’t even feel like you’re watching your fitness!!!'

Looking fab for the camera: She also shared several behind the scenes shots from her latest photo shoot

She said she was 'proud' of this chapter in particular because it’s something her fans have been asking her to share for a long time.

Jessie also noted she was in a Kittenish bikini. She founded her clothing line Kittenish in 2018.  

Jessie is hunkering down with her hunky husband Eric Decker, an ex-NFL player who has been in the Denver Broncos, New York Jets and Tennessee Titans.

They are joined in lockdown by their three children - six-year-old Vivienne, four-year-old Eric Jr. and two-year-old Forrest.

In June Jessie revealed little Forrest suffered bug bite, which developed a boil that had to be removed at the hospital.

She explained that the bite 'turned into a staph which turned into a boil! It was like a golf ball it was so hard and he was in so much pain.'

The mother-of-three wrote: 'He got a very high fever and we had to take him to the emergency room late night. Obviously with covid only I could I go in with him. They had to sedate him and cut it open and get it all out.'

She added: 'He handled it like a champ but it was so sad to see him in so much pain! I could not believe this happened. It was such a freak thing. He got in an antiobiotic and that helped big time.'

Jessie and Eric married in June 2013 at the St. Francis Of Assisi Church in the Colorado town of Castle Rock.

The family currently live in Nashville, Tennessee, the capital of the country music industry that made Jessie a star.

They relocated to a house in Music City last year that Jessie told People was her 'forever home,' gushing that it 'checks off every item on the wish list.
