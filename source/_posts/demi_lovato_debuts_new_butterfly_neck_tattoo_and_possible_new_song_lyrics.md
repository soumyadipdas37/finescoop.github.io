Demi Lovato has been on a heightened spiritual quest ever since her recovery following an opioid overdose in July 2018.

Just this past December, the songstress had the word 'survivor' added to the right side of her neck near her collarbone. Just days later, artist Alessandro Capozzi revealed her 'Divine Feminine' tattoo on her back near her neck, a design that took over eight hours to finish. 

The winged female figure is decked out in loosely draped clothing and she's being carried up by three white doves.
