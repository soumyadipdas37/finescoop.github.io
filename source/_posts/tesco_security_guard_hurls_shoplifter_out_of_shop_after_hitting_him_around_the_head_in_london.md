A Tesco security guard has been filmed punching a suspected shoplifter in the head before hurling him out of the store.

Other shoppers filmed the moment the man was beaten up at a Tesco Express branch on Blackfriars Road in Elephant and Castle, London, on Sunday evening.

The footage showed the security guard throw the alleged thief into a display by the store entrance. The employee then punched the man in the head while pinning him to the ground.

Another man can be heard cheering the security guard before telling him: 'Let him up, throw him out.'

The suspect was hurled out of the store but immediately got up and asked for his t-shirt, which was on the floor inside the shop, to be passed out to him.

The security guard shouted 'p**syhole' and threw the shirt over and behind the man. 

Before the clip comes to an end, the man approached the security guard and asked him what time he finished his work shift, presumably so they could continue the fight.

The viral clip has divided social media users – with some condemning the security guard's heavy-handed treatment of the man while others supported the use of force.

One user commented that the 'man probably fell on hardtimes, security doin too much its only tesco [sic].'

Another individual was disgusted by the security guard's behaviour, writing: 'IS THE SHOP HIS? Was that actually needed! F*ckin prick!'

Others found the incident amusing with one user comparing the security guard's attack to WWE: 'My guy threw him out like he was in the WWE'. 

Another said the Tesco employee was 'definitely earning his wages' as a security guard.

Others were stunned the suspected shoplifter seemed to challenge the security guard to a second fight at the end of the video. 

One wrote: 'Man got smacked silly and wanted a second round dun out ere'.

While another individual couldn't believe the man asked the security guard what time he finished work after he beat him up like that: 'How can you ask what time he finishes after THAT, you really want round 2???'
