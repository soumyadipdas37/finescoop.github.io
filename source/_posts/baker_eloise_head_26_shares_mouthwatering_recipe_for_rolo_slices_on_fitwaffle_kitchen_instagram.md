An 'Instagram famous' baker known for her decadent but remarkably simple desserts has revealed how to make caramel slices flavoured with Rolo chocolate - no oven required. 

Eloise Head, 26, is the founder of FitWaffle Kitchen, an Instagram page where she posts videos of decadent desserts that take just a few minutes to prepare.

'Just five ingredients and super quick and easy to make!' she wrote in the caption.

To make the base, Ms Head melts Rolos and butter in the microwave, then adds condensed milk and crushed biscuits.

After mixing well, she spoons the mixture into the base of an 8cm x 8cm baking dish and refrigerates for roughly one hour until set.

Once hardened, she removes the dish from the fridge and melts milk chocolate to pour over the top.

After shaking the tray to ensure chocolate spreads to every corner, Ms Head presses leftover Rolos into the liquid chocolate before refrigerating for another hour until set.

A video of the slices has been liked 10,600 times since it was shared on Saturday, with one viewer tagging her friend and saying: 'Next sleepover, we have to do these!'

Another followed suit, writing: 'This girl has so many tasty recipes!' 

Indeed it's the latest in a long line of viral recipes shared by the British social media star, who wowed foodies with a luscious Mars bar cheesecake earlier in August. 

Ms Head makes the soft nougat filled dessert with 230g of Mars ($5), 300g of plain biscuits ($3.95), 150g of unsalted butter ($5), 480ml of double cream ($3), 500g of cream cheese ($5.50) and 200ml of caramel sauce ($4.50), all available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.

For the base, she crushes the biscuits and stirs them into a saucepan of melted butter, then presses the buttery crumbs into the base of a 9cm tin.

The base is made by crushing biscuits into melted butter while the filling is an indulgent blend of cream cheese, icing sugar, double cream and chunks of Mars chocolate

To make the filling, Ms Head whisks the cream with icing sugar and cream cheese before adding chunks of Mars into the mixture.

She spoons the filling over the biscuit base and leaves to set in the fridge for six hours, minimum.

Once set, Ms Head drizzles ready-made caramel sauce over the top, allowing it to flow down over the edges to coat every inch of the cake.

She decorates with leftover chunks of Mars bar and sprinkles grated chocolate over the top to finish.
