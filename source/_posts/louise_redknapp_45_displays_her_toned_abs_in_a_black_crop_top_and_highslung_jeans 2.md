She has been documenting her workouts during lockdown. 

And Louise Redknapp flaunted her svelte physique in a black crop top and high-waisted jeans on Monday.

Louise draped an oversized tan blazer over her shoulders for the laid-back look and added height to her outfit with towering black court shoes.

The mother-of-two also posed in a cropped grey marl knit on her Instagram Stories as she modelled her favourite mohair-blend cardigan.

Louise has just returned from a trip to Ibiza with her sons Charley, 16, and Beau, 11, where she was sure to let her hair down. 

The star knows how to enjoy herself while maintaining a sporty figure at the same time, having also been announced as the new face of Pimm's.

The star will have plenty of home time as she will have to quarantine for two weeks with her sons now they have returned. 

Louise's outing comes hot on the heels of the news that her ex-husband Jamie has moved on with a new love, Swedish model Frida Andersson-Lourie.

The former footballer, 47, was photographed heading on a dog walk with the mother-of-four, 37, near his home in Surrey last week in pictures obtained by The Sun. 

It is thought to be Jamie's first confirmed relationship since his split from Louise, with whom he shares two sons, after 19 years of marriage.
