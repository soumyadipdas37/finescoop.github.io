Manchester City are 'hopeful' striker Sergio Aguero will be fit for their season opener against Wolves after making a fast recovery from knee surgery just three months ago.

The star frontman was expected to miss the start of the 2020-21 campaign after going under the knife in late June.

But according to the Sun, the Argentine will be available for selection by Pep Guardiola in the September 21 clash after making quick progression in his rehabilitation.

The report claims Aguero is now pain free and his mobility is improving which has given City confidence he will be available to feature in the Molineux face-off.

The north-west club will be thankful their season kicks off a week later than most teams after they and Manchester United were granted extra time off due to their European exploits last season.

Their season came to an end only three weeks ago when they were eliminated from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage after a 3-1 defeat against Lyon.

Aguero was absent for the disappointing defeat and Guardiola will be hoping he can keep the 32-year-old fit for as much of the season as he can.

City will be desperate to wrestle their Premier League crown back off Liverpool this campaign after finishing 18 points behind the Reds in the last campaign.
