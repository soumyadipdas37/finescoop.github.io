Madison Beer is poised to release her first full-length studio album this year, following the release of her new single Baby.

But over the weekend the pop singer got to enjoy some downtime when she headed out shopping with new TikToker boyfriend Nick Austin.

The couple were seen hopping in and out of their SUV along the world famous Melrose Ave. in the West Hollywood section of Los Angeles.

Never one to not want to make a statement with her fashion choices, Beer showed off her petite 5ft 4in figure in skin-tight baby blue shorts and a matching jacket that was thrown over her shoulders.

Underneath she wore a spaghetti-strap sports bra that helped showcase her toned midriff and bronze tan.

The New York native, 21, also donned white sneakers and socks as she carried an animal print purse and pulled her long brown tresses back off of her face with a center part.

She also made sure to match her outfit with the perfect protective mask, in adherence to health and safety protocols amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   

After parking their vehicle Austin, 20, joined up with his new lady dressed casually in a black t-shirt and black baseball cap on backwards over his newly dyed-blond hair.

He too had a safety first mentality and wore a medical mask over his face and nose. 

The new couple have been seen out and about in the West Hollywood area over the last month or so.

Beer initially gained prominence in 2012 when Justin Bieber tweeted the link to a cover song she shared on YouTube when she was just 13-years-old.

The overnight attention led to her landing a deal with Island Records and the release of her debut single Melodies in September of 2013, and subsequent video that featured a gust appearance by Bieber.

She released her second single Unbreakable the following year.

Making her mark: Beer has released four singles, with the last n=being the song Baby, ahead of her first full-length studio album which drops in 2020

Her debut 2018 EP As She Pleases boasts over 700 million streams globally, which helped garner her another big buzz in the music industry. 

After reportedly scrapping a first attempt and a full-length album, Beer eventually signed with Epic Records in 2019, and has been working in Life Support ever since.

She has dropped four singles ahead of the album's release since January, including the songs Good In Goodbye, Selfish, Stained Glass and Baby.
