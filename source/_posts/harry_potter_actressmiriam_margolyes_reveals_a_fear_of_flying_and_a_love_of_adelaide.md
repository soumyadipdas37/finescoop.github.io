Harry Potter actress Miriam Margolyes

This week the Australian-British actress who played Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter movies - Miriam Margolyes - checks-in to our travel Q&A.  

She reveals that she's a nervous flyer, loves islands and more... 

How are you coping without travel?

I keep in touch with people in different countries and watch travel programmes, and wish I could take part. It’s a real deprivation not to be able to travel.

Top weekend trip?

I’m very lucky because I’ve got three places to visit which belong to me. My favourite is my house in Tuscany, La Casella, a 300-year-old farmhouse. I’m hoping I can visit in September because it’s glorious at that time.

Are you a good flyer?

I’m always nervous and think that I’m going to die. For many years, I went everywhere by boat. I do fly now though.

Best memory from your latest travel series?

Sitting around the campfire at Seven Emu Station, seeing the Milky Way with total clarity.

Best bit of Australia?

I warm to there being no people. Goolwa in South Australia is glorious. And I’m fond of Adelaide. It’s an elegant, quiet city.

Miriam says that she loves islands and would love to go to Sardinia (pictured) next

Can’t travel without?

A book — and my glasses.

Where do you want to go next?

Sardinia. I love islands. And I’d also like to go back to Tasmania.
