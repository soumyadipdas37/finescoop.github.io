Roy Jones Jr has been sent a stark warning about fighting Mike Tyson from former heavyweight contender Danny Williams.

Boxing legends Jones Jr, 51, and Tyson, 54, are set to face off in an eight-round exhibition fight in Los Angeles on November 28.

Former heavyweight world champion Tyson will hold the natural size advantage over Jones Jr, who for much of his career campaigned in lower weight divisions. 

Danny Williams believe Mike Tyson is going to 'seriously hurt' Roy Jones Jr in exhibition clash

Williams, who shocked the world when he knocked out Tyson in four rounds back in 2004, is concerned that facing his former foe is a dangerous assignment for Jones Jr.

'I think Roy is going to get seriously hurt. He is a natural middleweight,' Williams told The Sun. 

Jones Jr himself has recently admitted he may come to regret the decision to fight Tyson - who is widely regarded as one of the most ferocious punchers of all time and seems to still carry significant power at glancing at his training videos.

Speaking to Sky Sports about the fight, Jones Jr said: 'When it comes time to fight, we're going to fight. If it comes down to bite, we're going to bite. Whatever has to happen, is going to happen, that's just what it is,' Jones said.

Williams fears for Jones Jr's welfare in the fight because Tyson is the naturally bigger man

'He's still Mike Tyson, he's still one of the strongest, most explosive people who ever touched a boxing ring. If anything, I made a mistake going in with him. He's the bigger guy, he's the explosive guy.

'He's going to have all the first-round fireworks, not me. I do have first-round fireworks, but he's known for more first-round fireworks than anybody to ever touch boxing, other than maybe George Foreman.

'With him having the first-round fireworks, he'll be against a guy smaller than him, maybe 40-50 pounds smaller than him. But who knows?'

Williams, meanwhile, confirmed his retirement from fighting at the age of 47 earlier this week after drawing serious concern from fellow fighters over the manner of his latest defeat against Sergey Kharitonov.
