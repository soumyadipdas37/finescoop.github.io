Cristiano Ronaldo became just the second player ever to score 100 international goals with a sublime free-kick against Sweden before later adding his 101st.

The Juventus superstar was stuck on 99 since November but finally broke the duck in trademark spectacular fashion. 

It looked as though he would have to continue his wait after struggling with injury, but the captain started the game and emphatically struck from distance to put his side ahead on the stroke of half time.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored a landmark 100 international goals with a sublime free kick 

Iran's Ali Daei still holds the record for the most international goals, with an incredible 109 from 149 caps. 

Ronaldo's former club Manchester United were quick to congratulate their former star, saying 'Congratulations to Cristiano on a century of international goals for Portugal'. 

Ronaldo is 14 goals ahead of Malaysia's Mokhtar Dahari in third, with Lionel Messi the nearest high-profile player on 70 goals for Argentina.
