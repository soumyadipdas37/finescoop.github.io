An online gaming addict said watching child porn every day made him 'feel good'. 

Troy Hyman, 37, known as 'Batman' to his friends was arrested at his home he shares with his mother in Lalor, in Melbourne's north, in March, 2018.

After banging down his door, police found several devices including phones, a laptop and computers which combined stored 29,746 images and videos of child porn.

The 37-year-old admitted to watching the pornography everyday for six years and said most of the children were between eight and ten-years-old but were 'smiling'. 

On Wednesday the former security guard pleaded guilty in the County Court to accessing and possessing child abuse material.

Hyman was caught after investigators from a specialist child abuse unit linked his IP address to an online peer-to-peer network that had been sharing child sexual material, the Herald Sun reported.

He said he knew what he was doing was wrong but continued anyway, telling police it made him 'feel good'.

The court heard that Hyman had eventually become 'desensitised' to the material.

His barrister described him as an 'introvert' who had become caught up in the world of online gaming.

The 37-year-old said most of the children in the videos were aged between eight and ten-years-old

'(He) goes from adult pornography to more risqué pornography to utterly illegal pornography,' his barrister said.

'He's actually really shy … he's not equipped to deal with … real women.'

Hyman had a 'perfectly normal' upbringing in Melbourne and went on to finish a health studies course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the court heard.

He will be sentenced at a later date and will be registered as a sex offender for 15 years.
