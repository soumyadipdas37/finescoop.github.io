Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane has claimed that brandishing excessively negative 'chicken licken' views about the impact of the pandemic could end up hurting the country's economy more than necessary.

In a speech today, Haldane said that authorities such as the BoE had a 'public responsibility to avoid economic catastrophizing' during the pandemic. 

During the Brexit vote in 2016, the BoE was often criticised for its overt warnings about the economic fallout from a pro-Brexit vote result.

The BoE now expects the economy to rebound with 'vertiginous' growth of 20 per cent in the third quarter, with Haldane today stating that the faster-than-expected recovery should not be overlooked.

This would mark a record bounce-back from recession, with official figures published today separately showing GDP collapsed by an upwardly revised 19.8 per cent in the second quarter.

Andy Haldane said that authorities such as the BoE had a 'public responsibility to avoid economic catastrophizing' during the pandemic

Haldane said in a speech at the Cheshire and Warrington Local Enterprise Partnership Economic Summit today: 'Averting an economic anxiety attack calls for a balanced and flexible approach to the words and actions of businesses and policymakers. 

'Planning for the worst is important, but needs to be accompanied by hope for the best. Encouraging news about the present needs not to be drowned out by fears for the future. Now is not the time for the economics of Chicken Licken.'

He added: 'I think the prevailing popular economic narrative, among businesses and households currently, is unduly negative. 

'It has emphasized recession and risk over recovery and resilience. It has resulted in good economic news (of which there has been plenty) being discounted too readily, and fearfulness about the future being accentuated.'    

Haldane said none of the conditions that would justify the BoE taking interest rates below zero for the first time in its 326-year history had yet been met.

He added that it was likely to be a 'number of months' before the BoE's work looking into the feasibility of negative rates would be finished.

His comments come amid mixed views from policymakers on negative rates in recent days after minutes of the latest Monetary Policy Committee meeting revealed the BoE was looking at how the policy tool could be put into practice.

No criteria met: Negative interest rates appear to be off the cards for the time being

Haldane said: 'Some commentators have interpreted the start of this work as conveying a signal about the likelihood of the MPC introducing negative rates in the near term.

'The minutes contained no such signal.'

Ruminating on the psychology behind fears surrounding the economy, Haldane said: 'If the economy were sat on a psychiatrist’s sofa, the diagnosis would not be especially difficult. 

'A propensity to dismiss good news and dwell on bad? To catastrophize about the future? 

'The sense of events being beyond our control? These are the psychological symptoms of anxiety. And collective anxiety is as contagious, and could be as damaging to our well-being, as this terrible disease.'

Haldane admitted that the economy faces an 'unholy trinity of risks' from rising Covid-19 cases, mounting job losses and the end-of-year Brexit deadline, but stressed there was a danger of exaggerating the threat they pose. 

To date, over 1million people have lost their jobs, as businesses like nightclubs and theatres continue to remain largely shut and other sectors seek to cut costs by shedding staff.

But, he added that the speed and scale of the recovery to date had been 'fairly remarkable.'

'The economy began its recovery from this dramatic fall earlier, and has since recovered far faster, than anyone expected,' he said.

Haldane has been one of the most optimistic over the UK’s economic recovery from the pandemic.

His views on negative rates also see him echo comments by the BoE's governor Andrew Bailey, who has sought to play down talk of a move to take rates negative since the last MPC meeting.

But signs of a split on the MPC are emerging, with external member Silvana Tenreyro appearing to back sub-zero rates at the weekend, saying there was 'encouraging' evidence on their effectiveness.

Just days later, Bank deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden took a very different stance, saying rates had likely already bottomed out at 0.1 per cent.
