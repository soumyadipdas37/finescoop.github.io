An Abraham Lincoln impersonator has been arrested on child porn charges. 

George Buss, 63, of Freeport, Illinois, has been accused of possessing child pornography video and patronizing a prostitute.  

As well as working as a Lincoln impersonator, Buss used to be a teacher at Freeport high school, according to his website.

He was taken into custody on Friday morning following a six-month police investigation that was launched in February, authorities said. 

Tyler Dotson, 22, of Leaf River, Illinois, was also arrested after the investigation. He is charged with two counts of child pornography disseminating video and prostitution, the Rockford Register Star reported.  

Buss is known across the state of Illinois as an Abraham Lincoln impersonator who has performed in venues including Quincy's Lincoln in the District. 

He is also the official Lincoln reenactor who performs the annual Gettysburg Address reading at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania. 

Buss' arrest occurred the day before his scheduled performance at the annual reenactment of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, a usually outdoors event held in Freeport's Debate Square, which was moved online during the coronavirus pandemic. 

He was booked at the Stephenson County Jail on Friday where he is being held in lieu of a $200,000 bond. 

Illinois State Rep. Andrew Chesney said in a statement to media that 'The crimes George Buss stands accused of are heinous. I denounce him in the strongest of terms.'

He added: 'My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. May their voices be heard and may justice be quickly served.' 

According to his website, Buss has a background in education across northern Illinois. He had worked at Freeport School District 145 for the past ten years, serving as its AVID District Director, according to his LinkedIn page. 

He was also Vice President for Equity with the local teachers' union.

He had been a teacher at Freeport High School, and once was a member of the district's Board of Education. 

Buss made his debut as an Honest Abe impersonator in 1986 and often performed as the historic president in elementary school classrooms. 

He would participate in mock Lincoln-Douglas debates up-and-down the state. The historic debates were held between Lincoln and incumbent Senator Stephen Douglas in 1858. 

Buss performed as Lincoln at the Lincoln-Douglas Elementary in Quincy, Illinois, as part of a post-President's Day lesson on February 18.
