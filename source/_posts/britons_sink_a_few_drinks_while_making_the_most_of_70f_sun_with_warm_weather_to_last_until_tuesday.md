Britons have flocked out to enjoy the last of the summer sunshine this weekend as rain is set to sweep across the nation next week.

Temperatures reached a warm 70F (21C) today, with people heading out across the UK to enjoy the last weekend of summer weather before rain is set to hit the nation next week. 

But temperatures are set to become cooler into next week, as Tuesday and Wednesday are set to bring in rain from the north west. 

The Met Office had forecast a weekend of 'largely dry, bright and fine' weather, which could see temperatures rise as high as 24C (75F).

Highs of 77F (25C) were recorded at Heathrow across today, as temperatures are set to hit similar highs tomorrow.

Kew Gardens and St James Park in London both reached 77F, with Kin Loch Ewe in Scotland also hitting 75F (24C). 

Ollie Claydon, a spokesperson for the Met Office, said that the warm weekend temperatures would come ahead of a more 'unsettled' week of weather.

'We're in for a dry and fine evening on Saturday, with clear conditions for central parts of the UK and northern Ireland,' he said.

'There's a risk of showers but temperatures will stay high.

'But then a cold front from the north west around lunchtime on Monday will herald the arrival of cooler, more unsettled weather next week.'

The September warmth follows on from an August heatwave which saw temperatures hit 93F (34C) for six days running last month.

The warmest September day of recent years was September 13, 2016, when 93.9F (34.4C) was recorded at Gravesend, Kent - the warmest day of that year

The highest temperature ever recorded in September was 96.08F (35.6C) on September 2, 1906, but they 'don't look like they're going to come anywhere close to that in this current hot spell', the forecaster said.

The warmest September day of recent years was September 13, 2016, when 93.9F (34.4C) was recorded at Gravesend, Kent - the warmest day of that year.

It comes as police forces across the UK urged people to comply with the Government's new 'rule of six' during the warm and sunny weather this weekend.

Further lockdown measures were also introduced in northern parts of England, with 10pm curfews being introduced in some areas across the northeast. 

Police officers in Manchester urged people to comply with coronavirus restrictions after they were called to reports of a wedding party at a home. 

Greater Manchester Police said officers attended a property in Wythenshawe on Friday evening, having received intelligence that a wedding party was being held.

'Police attended and found that a gazebo had been erected in the garden of a property,' the force tweeted.

'Officers prevented the illegal gathering before restrictions were breached.'

Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Constable Claire Nix, of Kent Police, said there would be an increased presence in 'key areas' around the county, as Covid-19 remains a 'real and deadly threat'.  

The Metropolitan Police urged Londoners to 'continue to act responsibly' amid forecasts of warm weather for the capital over the weekend.

The force said it will continue to patrol public spaces and respond to incidents where groups of more than six are gathering, reminding the public of fines for breaching coronavirus guidelines.
