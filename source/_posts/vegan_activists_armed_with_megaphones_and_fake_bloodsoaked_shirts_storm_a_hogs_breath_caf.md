Vegan activists wearing fake blood-spattered shirts have rallied outside a Hog's Breath Cafe with megaphones, screaming 'animals do not want to die'.

Noisy demonstrators from the Brisbane branch of militant animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere arrived at the Cleveland steak house on Sunday afternoon to urge diners to reconsider their diets.

Armed with signs and fake blood, the group marched along the promenade toward the alfresco table settings at the franchise.

Leah Doellinger, a group member who has copped numerous charges for actions associated with the vegan group, filmed the event.

'We're going to the Hog's Breath Cafe to speak to the public as say that we, as a society, have blood on our hands,' she told the camera while walking to the protest.

The demonstration protest began with a siren to capture the attention of the crowd before a leader started lecturing unwilling participants about the treatment of live stock in Australia.

Activists with fake blood stained hands stood in line formation out the front of the restaurant donning signs and TV screens showing footage from inside slaughter houses. 

What began as murmurs from the crowd to the tune of 'go away' and 'stop' quickly escalated as the extremist 14-strong group elevated their efforts.

'We're having chicken for dinner!' a child yelled in the background.

'F*** off,' said another.

'You're a d***head, mate,' added someone else.

Two group members began smearing fake blood from plastic bottles on the ground leaving a mess of crimson puddles and hand prints over the pebbles. 

'We have blood on our hands,' a female member wearing fake leather boots shouted, before launching into a screeching tirade. 

Ms Doellinger, who stood in front of the group to film the action, explained the group's ethos to angry diners who approached her for answers.

One frustrated diner from the restaurant grabbed a chair, aiming it at the male activist chanting into the loudspeaker 

As tensions rose, the group began chanting: 'Humane slaughter is a lie, animals do not want to die'

'I eat animals. I kill them myself. I love it,' said one smiling man.

'You should be ashamed of yourself,' she replied. 'You're a cruel person.'

As tensions rose, the group began chanting: 'Humane slaughter is a lie, animals do not want to die.'

One frustrated diner from the restaurant grabbed a chair, aiming it at the male activist chanting into the loudspeaker.

He raised his hand in defence, as the diner yelled 'F*** off,' before walking inside.

As the group moved around the outdoor food precinct, irate members of the public pleaded with them to stop. 

Another frustrated diner grew so enraged a scuffle broke out in the middle of the precinct

As members of the public and Direct Action Everywhere pulled the fighting pair apart, a group member said over the megaphone: 'We are not violent'

'Everyone's shouting. Stop the f***ing shouting,' one man begged.

'Your breath smells,' Ms Doellinger replied.

Another man grew so enraged a scuffle broke out.

As members of the public and Direct Action Everywhere pulled the fighting pair apart, a group member said over the megaphone: 'We are not violent'.

Vegans flocked to the comments section to congratulate the group for 'spreading  the truth'.

'Typical aggression from meat eaters. Happens every time! Animal activists are never violent. Loud... yes. But not violent. Typical male power trips,' one person wrote.

'Great work guys! I got chills watching that,' another added. 

Someone else said: 'Powerful disruption! Well done to everyone.'

It wasn't the first time the Brisbane faction of the global activist group disrupted people's meals.

In January, protesters held up signs and repeated the chant 'it's not food, it's violence' in the middle of the Black Hide Steakhouse in the city. 

The group live-streamed the protest to Facebook, urging animal rights supporters to share the video and spread their message.

Diners appeared uncomfortable as the group stood in the middle of the restaurant chanting and holding their signs.

Others stood out the front of the steakhouse confronting those who entered the restaurant with their message against meat.

The group are well known for their activities in Western Australia, where they have held several marches and protested outside abattoirs and butchers shops near Perth.
