Garrett's longest standing Hollywood relationship was with Kirsten Dunst who he dated from 2012-2016 before the couple split. 

On August 30, Emma confirmed the couple's pregnancy rumors on her own watch with a sweet series of Instagram posts.  

She and boyfriend Garrett could be seen basking in the bliss of impending parenthood as they embraced each other.

 Though Emma is still very much a coveted actress, the beauty has also found great success through her love of literature.  

Belletrist, the book club she founded a few years back, helps her audience find new books every month and has been praised by her fellow actors for their variety of poignant book recommendations. 

The venture has been especially important to its members in Quarantine as it has provided a way for her community to feel that necessary connection to others during this unprecedented time. 

With Hollywood having been on lockdown since March it has no doubt been fulfilling for Emma to still be able to continue nurturing her passion for reading. 

Her most recent movie project is her starring role in the romantic comedy, Holidate, which is set to be released on Netflix sometime in 2020.
