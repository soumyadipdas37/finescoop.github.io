New South Wales has recorded just one new case of COVID-19 in a another positive day for the state.

The only confirmed case of the virus was from a returned traveler currently in hotel quarantine.  

The case was detected from 12,258 tests.

NSW Health is urging people to get tested as soon as symptoms appear as residents move across the state a lot more during the start of the school holidays.

'We all need to do our part to keep the community safe from another outbreak,' NSW Health said on Saturday.

'Get tested right away at the earliest symptoms and help protect friends and family from serious disease. This is especially important in southwest Sydney.'

The state's three-day streak of no new locally acquired infections ended on Friday, with a man in his 50s from Sydney's southwest testing positive.

His infection could reset NSW's 'border clock' with Queensland if authorities cannot account for the origin of his case.

NSW Health said on Friday the man had not had contact with a previously confirmed case.

Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said it appeared the infection would reset the border clock with NSW but she would await the result of the investigation.

NSW must record 28 days with no community transmissions before its border with Queensland is reopened - a feat Premier Gladys Berejiklian has described as a 'pretty tall order'.

That target was on track to be reached on October 6 but the case has put it in doubt.

NSW Health has advised anyone who attended Woolworths in Campbelltown Mall on September 17 between 1.30pm and 2pm is considered a casual contact of the man and must monitor for symptoms.
