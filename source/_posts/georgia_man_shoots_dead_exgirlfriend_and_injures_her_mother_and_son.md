Karl Jordan, 26, was detained by U.S. Marshals and the Henry County Police Department on Thursday

Authorities have detained a Georgia man who shot three people - including a woman he formerly had a relationship with - before later robbing a Waffle House and shooting another woman in the head. 

Karl Jordan, 26, was detained by U.S. Marshals and the Henry County Police Department on Thursday. He was arrested as part of a joint investigation with the agencies and the Clayton County Sheriff's Office, who had been searching for the suspect in connection to the three-person shooting. 

During a press conference on Thursday, the CCSO shared that they received a call about a triple shooting at a residence in Glynn Court in the Hampton/Lovejoy area in Georgia on Wednesday night at around 9pm. 

Once they arrived at the scene, they learned that one of the victim's - a grandmother - had been sitting on the porch when she 'heard a loud sound.' 

The woman, who was not identified, went into the residence bedroom and discovered her daughter lying on the floor with an apparent gunshot wound. Her daughter's four-year-old son was standing over her at the time, police shared. 

Authorities say that Jordan shot his ex-girlfriend and a residence in Glynn Court before shooting her mother and four-year-old son. He then fled the scene in a Silver 2009 Acura (pictured)

The grandmother rushed to retrieve her grandchild and fled the scene, getting shot in the rear twice by the suspect. The four year old was shot from behind as well.  

Authorities shared that the grandmother was able to eventually get to a neighbors home to alert first responders as Jordan fled the scene in a Silver 2009 Acura.

The next day, authorities say that Jordan robbed Waffle House at 2045 Highway 155 in Henry County and shot a woman there in the head

All three victims were taken to a local hospital, but the mother succumbed to her injuries. The grandmother and the small boy are both said to have non-life threatening injuries. 

During the press conference, the sheriff's office shared that Jordan and the deceased woman had previously had a relationship. It is unclear on when the relationship occurred but authorities did share that they don't believe Jordan is the father of the child.  

The next day, authorities say that Jordan robbed Waffle House at 2045 Highway 155 in Henry County and shot a woman there in the head. Jordan left the Acura at the scene, stealing the 2011 Dodge Avenger belonging the woman he allegedly shot, the CCSO shared in a release.

The condition of the woman is currently unknown.

Police obtained a weapon at the scene of Jordan's arrest and it is believed to be the same firearm used in the triple-shooting. The CCSO shared that shell casings were recovered at the scene.

The Henry County Police Department plan on charging Jordan with aggravated assault and armed robbery. 

It is currently unknown what charges he will face in Clayton County as the shooting is still under investigation.

Authorities share that Jordan has a criminal history and was recently released from prison.
