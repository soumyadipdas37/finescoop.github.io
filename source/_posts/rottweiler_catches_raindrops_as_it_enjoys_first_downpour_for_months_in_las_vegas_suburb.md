This is the moment an excited Rottweiler ran out into its owner's garden to splash around in a rare rainfall in a Las Vegas suburb.

Amber Opheikens filmed her rottweiler Tank jumping up-and-down in the downpour on her patio in Henderson, Nevada, after months without any measurable rain.

In the footage, taken on September 21, the water-loving hound stands on its hind legs and sticks its tongue out to try and catch the falling raindrops.

The energetic dog runs across the patio at speed and seemingly cannot cope with the excitement of the rare downpour.

Rottweiler Tank tried to catch raindrops in its mouth on September 21 as Henderson, Nevada, enjoyed a rare downpour after more than 150 days without rain

Ms Opheikens can be heard saying to Tank: 'Get the rain, get it Tank!'

The rottweiler refuses to shelter from the rainstorm during the video, continuing to splash around on the soaking wet patio. 

Another voice is heard shouting in surprise: 'Oh my God, it is raining so much!'

In the video, Ms Opheikens's daughter stands completely drenched with Tank in the downpour, enjoying the warm rain in shorts and a t-shirt.

Ms Opheikens said that although Tank 'loves anything with water', this was her dog's first time chasing the rain. 

The downpour in Henderson came after a record stretch of 154 days without any measurable rain at McCarran International Airport, according to the National Weather Service.

But the small showers of rain on September 21 were isolated to Henderson and Anthem, meaning that Las Vegas continued its stretch without precipitation, breaking the previous record from 1959.

It is reported that there has been no rain measured at McCarran International Airport, home of the National Weather Service's Las Vegas rain gauge, since April 20.

Residents have been warned by scientists to expect the lack of rain in this year's monsoon season to continue, according to the Las Vegas Sun.

Professor of geoscience at UNLV said it is not 'altogether uncommon' for the monsoon to fail, referring to years including 2010 and 1962. 

He added: 'Climate change is influencing the amount of water available when there is water. Of course when there’s zero monsoon, then there’s zero water.'

Nevada's wetter season normally lasts from July until March, with the chance of a wet day being greater than seven per cent, Weatherspark reported.
