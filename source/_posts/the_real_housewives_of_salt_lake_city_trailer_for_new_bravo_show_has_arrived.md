The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is the latest in the Bravo franchise to launch on our screens, and judging by the trailer, it'll be well worth a watch.

The teaser was released on Wednesday and introduces us to the main cast that consists of Lisa Barlow, Mary Cosby, Heather Gay, Meredith Marks, Whitney Rose and Jen Shah, who all appear to have a story to tell. 

Firstly, Salt Lake City is known to be the global headquarters for Mormons, but not all the cast follow the religion, with Meredith revealing she is Jewish and Lisa explaining she is 'Jewish by heritage and Mormon by choice.'

Meanwhile Mary is Pentecostal, the Protestant Christian movement. However, despite their religious beliefs, it seems that many of the housewives are no strangers to sin. 

Heather is the first housewife to speak in the trailer, saying 'Perfection is attainable,' adding: 'I am a purebred, pioneer Mormon.'

Meredith then adds 'Hashtag blessed on that one!' before revealing she is actually from Chicago.

Whitney reveals she is 'no longer Mormon' suggesting there is some drama to be discussed as it's been a 'big deal' in her family. 

Jen, who was raised Mormon, tells viewers she is now converting to Islam, before she is seen lifting up her top to reveal some underboob. 

Lisa can then be heard saying that a good Mormon doesn't drink or have sex, as the ladies run wild, before adding: 'I was bringing the decadence, while they were bringing the depression.'

There's certainly going to be no shortage of fights with the girls too, in true Housewives style.

'There's a lot of misrepresentation of who is friends with who in this circle," says Meredith, as Mary adds, 'She hates my guts.'

'I don't judge you, but I don't care enough to judge you,' Lisa offers. 

The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is set to premiere on Nov. 11, on Bravo. 

LISA BARLOW

Born in New York, Lisa Barlow has been living in Utah for over 20 years. As the owner of a marketing company and various tequila brands, she considers herself “Mormon 2.0” as she is not one to adhere to all of the traditional and strict Mormon rules. Lisa attended BYU with Heather and has been best friends with Meredith for years. Married to her husband John with two children, she seemingly has it all, but struggles with her quest for perfection when her unrealistic standards start impacting her friendships.

MARY COSBY

With a penchant for God, couture and only the finest champagne, Mary Cosby is a Pentecostal First Lady who inherited her family’s empire of churches, restaurants and more. The caveat in her taking over the family business was that she marry her late grandmother’s second husband, Robert Cosby Sr. They have since been married for 20 years and have one teenage son together. Small but mighty and always dressed to the nines, her unconventional past has made her guarded and she quickly finds herself on shaky ground with some of the ladies.

Religious: Mary is a Pentecostal First Lady

HEATHER GAY

A devout Mormon from birth, Heather Gay was married to Mormon royalty for 11 years, but has distanced herself from the church after her divorce. A self-proclaimed ‘good Mormon gone bad,’ she now considers herself “Mormon-ish” as she plays by her own rules. A devoted mother to three daughters, she owns a burgeoning Med-Spa business, Beauty Lab and Laser where the ladies often frequent. As she embarks on the next chapter of her life, Heather is on a journey of self-discovery as she finds her voice and looks for love again.

MEREDITH MARKS

Meredith Marks is a celebrity jewelry designer with a store on Main Street in Park City. Jewish and married for over 25 years, Meredith and her husband Seth have hit a rough patch and with their kids in college, she is faced with being an empty nester for the first time in her life. An ice queen with a knack for partying, Meredith is often out on the social circle alongside Jen and Lisa, who love to buy her jewelry - even the rings off her fingers. Meredith appears to have it all but when rumors begin to swirl, she must decide if she wants to turn to her girlfriends for support or suffer in silence.

We won't tell! Meredith reveals in the trailer she is originally from Chicago

WHITNEY ROSE

A descendant of “Mormon Royalty,” Whitney Rose has been trying her best to navigate life outside of the religion for over a decade. She left the church after she fell madly in love with her boss, Justin, and the two had an affair. Within weeks, they both left their spouses to be with each other and got married when Whitney found out she was pregnant. Married for 10 years, they have two children – Bobbi and Brooks - and she owns a skin care line called Iris and Beau. Now, she is faced with parenting her father who is dealing with his own struggles and depends on her for everything. And just when it seems like society is finally beginning to accept her 10-year-marriage, scandalous rumors about her progressive relationship start to swirl.

JEN SHAH

As a Tongan and Hawaiian growing up in Salt Lake City, Jen Shah felt like she often stuck out in her traditionally white, Mormon world. When she learned about the historical mistreatment of black people in the Mormon religion, she converted from Mormonism to Islam. A mom of two with her husband, Sharrieff, Jen is the queen of her house and her businesses as the CEO of three marketing companies. Always decked out in designer brands, Jen loves to host parties and spares no expense - it’s important to her that everyone knows she is the best host in Utah. With an extravagant personality and sharp tongue, she can go from 0 to 100 very quickly, but usually comes back with apologies and love. But it’s not always fun and games for Jen with this group of women when she quickly finds herself at the center of the drama.
