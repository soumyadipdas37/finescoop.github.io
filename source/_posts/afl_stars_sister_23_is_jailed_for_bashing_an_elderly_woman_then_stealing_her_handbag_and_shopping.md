The sister of an AFL star has been jailed after bashing and mugging an elderly woman while on bail for holding up a liquor store with a pair of scissors. 

Sally-Anne Powell-Pepper, 23, whose brother Sam plays for Port Adelaide, was sentenced to three years in prison at Perth's District Court this week over a series of brazen robberies.  

The court heard how the mum-of-three's first offence occurred in November last year when she stole ten cans of bourbon from a Bayswater liquor store, The West Australian reported.  

After plucking the items from a fridge, she walked out of the store without paying.

Staff workers rushed after, at which point she produced a pair of scissors and threatened to stab them.

Powell-Pepper then fled the scene but was arrested a short time later by police who found her in a bus stop with the booze, valued at just over $51. 

Officers seized scissors and a knife were in her possession. 

The second altercation occurred just three months later, on January 9, when she assaulted an elderly woman in an East Perth car park.

After watching the woman struggle with her shopping, the court heard how Powell-Pepper followed her to her car then punched her in the head.

She demanded the woman give her the handbag, and the woman offered up the money in her wallet instead. 

Unsatisfied with the woman's offer, Powell-Pepper hit her again, then took of with her handbag and shopping. 

The attack occurred hours after Powell-Pepper had faced court over the first theft. 

She was arrested months later and confessed to the crime. 

In court earlier this year, Judge Ronald Birmingham described the offender as 'disgraceful' and 'thuggish'.
