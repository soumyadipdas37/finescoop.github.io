Nadia Bartel enjoyed a family getaway on Southern Italy's Amalfi Coast with her then-husband, Jimmy Bartel, in 2018. 

And on Monday, the 35-year-old was reminiscing about that vacation, sharing an Instagram video featuring highlights from the trip. 

In the clips, Nadia was pregnant with her second son with Jimmy, Henley, now one, and showed off her bump in a orange bikini while filming herself in the mirror.

Other sections of the video show her on a boat in another bikini, this time in a red and white striped pattern, being filmed presumably by Jimmy. 

She also panned over her incredible view and some delectable food she enjoyed during the trip. 

Over the top of the clip, Nadia played The Beatles song All My Life.

She showed off her growing baby bump while posing in a bikini in photos taken at the Bagni d'Arienzo Beach Club.

Nadia and Jimmy announced their separation on August 15 last year, but are believed to have actually parted ways two months prior.
