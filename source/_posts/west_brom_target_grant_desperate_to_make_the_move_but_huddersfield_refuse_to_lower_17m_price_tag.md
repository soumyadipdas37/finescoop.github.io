Karlan Grant has set his sights on a move to West Brom despite Huddersfield holding out for £17million for the striker.

Albion boss Slaven Bilic has identified Grant as his top target to improve his attack, with the club putting together a deal that could eventually be worth up to £15m for the 22-year-old.

Grant is desperate to make the move and is believed to have grown frustrated at Huddersfield's stance, as the Championship club have so far proved unwilling to budge.

Bilic wants a new forward in place before Sunday's Premier League opener against Leicester at The Hawthorns following the permanent signing of winger Grady Diangana, who spent last season on loan from West Ham.

Grant has scored 23 goals in 51 starts for Huddersfield and is considered one of the most promising strikers outside the top flight.

Earlier on Wednesday Albion completed the capture of Callum Robinson from Sheffield United after his impressive loan stint during the second half of last season.

Robinson's move sees winger Oliver Burke leave Albion to join the Blades.
