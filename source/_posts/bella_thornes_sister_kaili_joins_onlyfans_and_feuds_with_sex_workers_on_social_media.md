Bella Thorne's older sister Kaili has joined OnlyFans and is feuding with sex workers on social media after her sibling sparked outrage by raking in millions on the site. 

Kaili, 28, followed her sister's lead by creating a profile on OnlyFans, a platform which is mainly used to sell X-rated content, and was met with immediate backlash after she claimed that was she is doing does not classify as sex work.  

The elder Thorne, who charges $9.99 per month to subscribe to her risqué photos, launched an attack on her critics on Tuesday by sharing a screengrab of comments she'd received on Instagram.  

'There is no right or wrong way to do sex work. It's facts. If you're sucking for crack it's still legit sex work,' someone wrote in one comment.    

Kaili responded: 'The argument is that sex should not be work. That's why it turns into human trafficking and should be stopped.  

'Sex work does not exist. It is not real.'

Bella Thorne sparked outrage after she created an OnlyFans profile last week and reportedly raked in $2million in two days. Sex workers slammed the former Disney star for profiting so heavily off of the site while doing little to help distigmatize sex work

Kaili launched an attack on her critics on Tuesday by sharing a screengrab of comments she'd received on Instagram. She responded to one by writing: 'Sex work does not exist. It is not real'

'Would I call it legit? No. Nothing about "sucking for crack" is legitimate,' Kaili wrote over the screengrab.  

'You want me SO badly to be apart of your little club and I refuse. I rather save the world,' she responded to another sex worker's post. 

When one person commented: 'There are people who will not be able to feed their children or themselves because of y'all,' Kaili replied: 'Wait. A. Table.'

Kaili also sought to defend her sister against those who've accused Bella of taking work away from other women by joining the platform.  

Kaili hit out at critics in a video on her Instagram story, saying: 'Get creative and maybe you'd keep your clientele'

The former Disney star created an OnlyFans profile last week and raked in $1million on her first day and has made at least $2million so far.

Sex workers slammed Bella, 22, for profiting so heavily off of the site while doing little to help distigmatize sex work and claimed that she caused OnlyFans to put caps on how much users can be paid. 

Kaili refuted those claims, writing: 'Sex work is short lived. MY SISTER DID NOT DAMAGE YOUR LIVELIHOOD. 

'You physically can't sell sex after a certain point in your life. Sorry for cutting that short.' 

She took her attack even further in a video, telling critical fellow OnlyFans users: 'All your bios say the same thing: "Insatiable s**t.' Get creative and maybe you'd keep your clientele.'  

Kaili later explained to Page Six that she was merely trying to defend herself.  

'These girls … have been bullying me nonstop,' she said. 'I was not calling any sex worker "insatiable s**t" or any other type of s**t. I was directing my comments back to these girls that call themselves that.

She continued: 'I'm saying that since sex is not work to me, I don't consider it a job to me. I'm not saying it about anyone else. What people do for a living is their choice.'

Kaili posted this risque photo on her Instagram amid her row with OnlyFans users on Tuesday, writing in the caption: 'I just know that all the ppl ever to know me are like, wtf did kaili get herself into this time? My poor grandpa lol'

Kaili waded into the OnlyFans fray three days after Bella apologized for 'hurting' sex workers by joining the platform, which allows creators to sell content to subscribers and has gained a reputation as a safe way for sex workers to earn money. 

Bella claimed that she made a profile as research for a movie about OnlyFans and because she wanted to help destigmatize sex work.  

But she drew outrage when she charged $200 for a 'naked' photo where she was not actually nude and people reportedly demanded refunds, according to the Los Angeles Times.

She said on her social media accounts that she does not offer nudity. She told the Times that a post circulating the internet claiming to offer the nude was falsified.

Content creators say Only Fans subsequently imposed payment caps of $50 on pay-per-view posts from a previous cap of $200, and a $100 cap on tips last Thursday. 

The company also enacted a hold on payments that would make some international creators wait 30 days to receive their money – without any warning.

Thorne issued a lengthy apology to sex workers on Twitter on Saturday saying she started her OnlyFans page to remove the stigma behind sex work



She said she's in talks with OnlyFans regarding the new payment restrictions

Some sex workers, who earn a significant portion of their income on the platform, blamed Thorne for the new policies that now limit their abilities to make money. 

'OnlyFans is a full-time job for some of us, mostly the only income some of us have, when she has movies and other outlets to continue to make money,' Jenna Foxx, who has worked with OnlyFans since 2017, told the New York Times. 

'She already is rich — on top of the $2million she made. She didn't hurt anyone but the sex community and hasn't spoken out about it. That's why we are not okay with what happened.' 

'Bella Thorne is the Walmart of Onlyfans,' one Twitter user slammed.

'So cute how Bella Thorne made her Onlyfans on a whim without doing an once of research on how it would impact the community and she immediately f***ed it up for us,' another user wrote.

'I finally got caught up on Bella Thorne/ Only Fans, and a white Disney star and still *working* actress f***ing up a platform that allowed sex workers to earn safely and with autonomy is basically THE snapshot of WW coopting spaces for the marginalized in the name of empowerment,' a third added.

In a series of tweets on Saturday, Bella insisted that she only intended to normalize sex work, not financially harm sex workers. 

'I wanted to bring attention to the site, the more people on the site the more likely of a chance to normalize the stigmas, And in trying to do this I hurt you,' she wrote. 

'I have risked my career a few times to remove the stigma behind sex work, porn, and the natural hatred people spew.' 

She also said she's meeting with Only Fans about the new restrictions.

'Ps. I'm meeting with only fans about the new restrictions to find out why!!! This is f***ed up and I'm sorry comment any ideas or concerns you want brought up to OF!! and send me your links and a pic so I can promote you guys,' she wrote. 

OnlyFans released a statement saying that the payment changes were not based on one user.

'Transaction limits are set to help prevent overspending and to allow our users to continue to use the site safely,' the company said in a statement. 

'We value all of the feedback received since this change was implemented and we will continue to review these limits,' it added.
