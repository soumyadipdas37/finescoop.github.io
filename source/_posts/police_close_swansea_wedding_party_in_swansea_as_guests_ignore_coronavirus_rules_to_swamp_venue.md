Police shut down a wedding reception after dozens of well wishers crammed into a Swansea restaurant.

The local authority has told the bar to close after a large number of people attended the celebration. 

Pictures from the night appear to show people not social distancing and crammed into Adelina's Bar and Kitchen, Mumbles Road, last Thursday.

Guests appeared to ignore social distancing at the wedding party

Officers were called to the scene and they forced everyone who was there to mark the joyous event to leave.

Swansea Council has now issued an immediate closure notice to the owners for failing to protect customers, according to Wales Online.

The venue now has a fortnight to put new measures in place including controlled use of toilets and two-metre social distancing.

A spokesperson for Adelina's Bar and Kitchen told The Sun staff had become 'overwhelmed' by the situation. 

Staff at the restaurant say they only took a booking for 25 people for the wedding reception.

Staff at the restaurant claim that they were overrun at the event

They claim to be unaware of bookings taken in other parts of the restaurant for the same party. 

They told The Sun: 'We only had six members of staff on for the night, as things started to get slightly out of hand the staff got overwhelmed.

'At this point the owner had been called who was on his way to ask everyone to leave.

'Before the owner could arrive though the police had attended the scene.

'We would like to thank all the police that attended that night and the council officers who came to the premises the next day.

'We would also like to take this chance to apologise for what took place in our restaurant as it wasn't our intention at all.

'We will be putting in much more strict coronavirus prevention measures in place in the future.'

A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: 'South Wales Police responded to a report of a gathering at the Adelina's Bar and Kitchen at approximately 7.10pm on Thursday.

'Upon arrival officers found large number of people in attendance at a private function.

'The function was shut down and all attendees ordered to leave.

'Further enforcement action by South Wales Police and Swansea Council is currently being considered.'

Organisers of a wedding in Telford, Shropshire, have been fined £10,000 for breaching covid-19 rules.

Reports from West Mercia Police say that 120 people were celebrating at a party which they shut down at 5pm on Friday.

While Greater Manchester Police shut down a wedding with 70 guests on Friday night and they also handed out a £10,000 fie to the organisers.

Guests initially argued with the police over leaving the reception in Longsight, Manchester.

The Swansea wedding comes just days before Wales introduces new strict lock-down measures.

These will come into force from 6pm on Sunday in Cardiff and the county of Swansea.

While the town of Llanelli will face new restrictions from 6pm on Saturday.

Under the new rules people will only be able to meet people they do not live with outdoors for the time being.

They will not be able to leave the area without a reasonable excuse. Swansea recorded 28 new cases of coronavirus on Friday.

Councillor David Hopkins, cabinet member for delivery and operations and deputy leader of Swansea council, said: 'We told businesses that we would take firm action if they failed to comply with Welsh Government rules.'

While revelers around the county enjoyed a last night on the town before the Government's curfew bit.

Drinkers in Leeds, Newcastle and Manchester enjoyed a last pint before the curef imposed by the government bit.
