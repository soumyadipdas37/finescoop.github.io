Strict COVID-19 rules inside the Queensland NRL bubble are taking their toll on players, who aren't even allowed to sleep in the same room as their partners. 

Brisbane Broncos fullback Darius Boyd warned players were struggling with the home quarantine requirements, which include no sex, no grocery shopping and no exercise away from their club. 

Boyd called for an easing of the restrictions because of the impact they are having on the mental health of players who 'don't have the tools to handle it'.

The strict quarantine rules (pictured) restrict players from leaving their homes for any reason other than training or games and they can't even sleep in the same bed as their partners 

The Brisbane fullback said he's still had bad days despite having a strategy to apply when he is feeling down.

'I had a bad day and I thought, "I don't know if I can do this",' Boyd told The Daily Telegraph.

'I know the strategies I use for my mental health, but I had a day where I was just like "this is ridiculous, I'm really struggling".'

Under the NRL's Project Apollo protocols players are not allowed to leave their homes for any reason other than training with their club or for a game. 

While at home players must remain at least 1.5m from anyone they live with and have to sleep alone. 

Boyd has reached out to the Rugby League Players Associations, the NRL and the Queensland government asking for an easing of restrictions for the well-being of players. 

He said players who lived alone were the worst off because they weren't even allowed to visit teammates they'd trained with that same day.  

'I've been pushing to the RLPA hoping that the Queensland Government will take it on board for us, just to be allowed to go for a walk outside the house, go through a drive-thru to get a coffee, just a couple of small leniencies,' he said.  

He said whether people knew it or not, the slightest easing of the restrictions could have large benefits for the mental health of some players.  

Boyd (pictured) said he wasn't calling for players to be allowed back into restaurants or cafes but for an easing of restrictions to help players cope with the struggles of playing in the NRL bubble
