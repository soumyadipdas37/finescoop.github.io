She's usually showing off her glamorous looks on the red carpet with her husband Matthew McConaughey.

But Camila Alves gave her 584K fans a more natural glimpse of her beauty on Sunday when she shared a makeup-free closeup selfie to her Instagram.

The 38-year-old Brazilian-born model showed off her best pout while flaunting her natural raven tresses.

Camila rested her chin in her hand and wore a white top while gazing into the camera with a sly smile.

She left her hair messy and had strands falling down over her eye. 

The low-key look was a far cry from the heavily made-up image she cultivates when strutting down the catwalk or posing with her husband.

'Dear long weekend, I like you...,' she wrote, adding a kissing emoji. 

The model has had plenty of long weekends throughout the coronavirus pandemic as she has quarantined with her husband Matthew, his mother Kay McConaughey and their children Levi, 12, Vida, 10, and Livingston, seven.

Blast from the past: On Thursday, she shared another unvarnished look at herself with a throwback photo of herself as a child when she still lived in Brazil

On Thursday, Camila shared another unvarnished look at herself with a throwback photo taken when she was just a child and still living in Brazil.

She had long, wavy hair in the picture and wore a blue and white striped shirt with teal pants and blue sneakers.

The future model also had an adorable black puppy perched on her lap. 

'I was a bit of a tomboy growing up with a lot in my mind always!' she wrote of the photo, in which she looked deep in concentration.

'I am not much of a tomboy now but I still have a lot in my mind...always!! My first dog here was named Bobby. He wouldn’t stop stealing our food he was very naughty! (I thought it was funny) My dad gave him away... so I think that’s part of why I want every animal I see!,' she wrote, before repeating the text in Portuguese.

'Love': Last month, Camila shared a romantic black and white photo of herself and Matthew while both wore cloth masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus

Still going strong: Camila married Matthew back in June 2012, six years after they started dating

Last month, Camila shared a romantic black and white photo of herself and Matthew while both wore cloth masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The Oscar winner embraced the model and leaned in for a kiss, despite the fabric getting in the way.

She let the image do most of the talking and simply captioned it, 'Love.'

Camila married Matthew back in June 2012, six years after they started dating.

The couple had already started a family by that point, with Levi arriving in July 2008 with Vida following soon after in January 2010.
