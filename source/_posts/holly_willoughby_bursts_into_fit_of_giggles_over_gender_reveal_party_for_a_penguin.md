Holly Willoughby was left in hysterics on Wednesday's episode of This Morning during a gender reveal party for a penguin.

The TV presenter, 39, could hardly contain herself as she and co-host Phillip Schofield spoke to Dr Scott Miller about the gender reveal at a zoo for the penguin, a female who was named Squirt because she kept 'popping'. 

Speaking from the zoo via link, Dr Scott said: 'Is it possible to tell a male from a female? Normally as a vet, we would just turn an animal upside down and check for suitable plumbing.'

Phillip then turned to Holly and said: 'Even if it was a giraffe?' prompting her to burst into a fit of giggles. 

Afterwards, Phillip said: 'That was a bizarre way to start the show.'

Holly replied: 'That's what I like to be talking about actually.'

'Penguins?' Phillip said.

She answered: 'I mean, not just specifically penguins but nice stories.'

Phillip joked: 'I mean, over the next six months it's going to be quite hard to find a story a day about penguins but we'll give it a go!'

Laughing, Holly replied: 'That's a challenge for you!

Speaking to the viewers, Phillip said: 'I have to say I don't know if it's just the point today we've just been pushed over the edge. We can't take any more. There's an element of hysteria!'

Still laughing, Holly said: 'Honestly, I don't know what's happened to me! I think it is that! 

'Everything feels so much to deal with in your own head, I can't stop laughing!'

'It's a coping mechanism,' Phillip told her.
