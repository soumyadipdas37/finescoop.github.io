Real Housewives of Cheshire star Dawn Ward is reportedly planning to transform her £14.5 million mansion into a luxury spa retreat.

The reality star, 47, has finally received planning permission to begin work on Warford Hall, which will include an extension for a swimming pool complex and added guest rooms.

Dawn and her husband Ashley have been struggling to sell the mansion - described by some as a mini village - for more than five years, after claiming it costs £100,000 a year in utility bills, and have now filed papers with their plans to begin a huge renovation on the property.
