Diversity's Jordan Banjo and Perri Kiely have candidly discussed the backlash from their controversial BLM routine on Britain's Got Talent. 

After the dance troupe's performance on September 5, Ofcom received 24,500 complaints but have since announced they will not investigate any further. 

However despite the furore, the professional dancers have said that they've also seen 'so much positivity' from the public in a new interview with Hello!.

 Jordan, 27, said that despite at first thinking lots of the feedback was negative, he's also seen 'so much positivity'.

'All you can really do is go on and speak your own truth. It was a dance piece. No one went on television to be antagonistic or spark a media frenzy. There were no politics,' he added. 

The dancer added that he's been receiving encouraging words from the public, with one person even saying they loved the dance when he popped into a petrol station. 

Dancing sensation Perri, 24, agreed, adding: 'It wasn't as if we were doing something wrong. We just wanted to get people talking about it.'

Earlier this week, TV and radio presenter Jordan shared BGT judge David Walliams' reaction to the troupe's performance.  

He said the comedian - who is yet to publicly comment on the performance - 'loved' their set and insisted he's not offended by his choice to remain silent on the matter. 

The Kiss FM Breakfast Show star said in a new interview: 'Ashley has been there with David and we know his reaction, he loved the routine and thought it was wicked.

'No one should be made to have to scream and shout out or anything – you agree or you don't and you know that it is what it is. No one should be made to feel guilty for saying something or not saying something.' 

The choreographer also shed light on the public's overwhelmingly 'positive' response to their powerful set as he told Metro: 'There has genuinely been so much positivity face-to-face, so much positivity online and it just shocks me when I see that many complaints – and then I go 'hang on' that's relatively such a small amount.'

While last weekend's episode of Britain's Got Talent also racked up 1,675 Ofcom complaints, after Alesha Dixon was seen wearing a Black Lives Matter necklace.

Complaints: The most recent episode of Britain's Got Talent has racked up 1,675 Ofcom complaints, after singer Alesha, 41, was seen wearing a Black Lives Matter necklace 

Show judge Alesha, 41, donned the statement jewellery, one week after Diversity's set was also subject to an avalanche of complaints.

However, while her choice of jewellery left some viewers disgruntled, the number of complaints pales in comparison to the 24,500 filed following Diversity's performance the week before.

An Ofcom spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.' 

Grateful: The singer took to Instagram to share a snap of the advert, and wrote: 'Well done @ITV for standing with Diversity'

Thankful: Ashley also shared his gratitude with ITV for standing by Diversity over their Black Lives Matter-inspired performance

ITV has 'stood with Diversity' as they featured adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial dance. 

ITV are believed to have spent around £260,000 on the newspaper ads with full-page monochrome pieces in The Metro costing £36,461 and £27,700 in The Mirror. 

Alesha was one of many who praised ITV for standing by the dance troupe. The singer took to Instagram to share a snap of the advert and gushed over how 'proud' she was with them. 

In her caption, she wrote: 'Well done @ITV for standing with Diversity! Proud of you! This image is in all of the national newspapers today.'

Decision: A spokesperson for government-approved regulatory body Ofcom confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken for Diversity's BLM-inspired routine 

Ashley also shared his gratitude with ITV for standing by Diversity over their Black Lives Matter-inspired performance. 

The poster showed a poignant black and white image of Ashley taking the knee alongside the words: 'We are changed by what we see. Just as we are changed when we are seen. ITV stand with Diversity.'

Sharing a snap of the same advert, which shows him kneeling in black-and-white, he wrote: 'This is what change looks like.

'@ITV stand with @Diversity and we've never been prouder. This is in all the national papers today. Thank you again to everyone that has supported us.' 

Support: The broadcaster shared a statement on their Twitter page as the furore continued
