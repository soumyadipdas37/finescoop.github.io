Paris Hilton has revealed she's ready for motherhood as the heiress credits her boyfriend with helping her get through the abuse she endured as a teen in boarding school, she exclusively told DailyMail.com. 

The 39-year-old socialite and entrepreneur gives fans a much different look into her glamorized life in her new documentary This Is Paris, which premiered on Monday on YouTube.  

Hilton became so close with director Alexandra Dean while filming, she disclosed secrets she had never shared before about being mentally and verbally abused while at Provo Canyon School, a boarding school she attended in Utah.

Hilton said she used to suffer from severe nightmares every night, but speaking out about her experience has helped release many of those painful emotions, as well as her relationship with boyfriend Carter Reum. 

Now Hilton said she's ready to focus on having a family with Reum, 39, saying: 'We have an incredible relationship which makes me feel so happy and safe that I don't have any nightmares anymore.' 

She added: 'I can't wait to have my baby daughter named London.'

Hilton said she never set out to expose her deepest darkest secret, but that changed when the film's director gained her trust.

She explained: 'The premise of the film was about my life and being a businesswoman and all the hard work I've put into that and this just happened organically where I became so close to the director I started talking about traumatic experiences that happened in my life. 

'All the memories that I tried to erase with my mind just started flooding back. I didn't want this in the film, even during the editing process I felt like it was too personal. I had never told anyone.'

Hilton spent 11 months at Provo Canyon from 1998 to 1999, before leaving when she turned 18. 

She had ended up there after being sent to a series of boarding schools, following a rebellious phase while living at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City with her family. 

Provo Canyon, the last in a series of schools her parents enrolled her in, focused on behavioral and mental development. 

It has come under fire for questionable practices and ongoing claims of widespread emotional, verbal and physical abuse.

Hilton left the school in 1999, after she turned 18, recalling: 'I was so grateful to be out of there, I didn’t even want to bring it up again' (pictured in August, 2000)

Hilton told People of her time at the boarding school: 'From the moment I woke up until I went to bed, it was all day screaming in my face, yelling at me, continuous torture.

 'The staff would say terrible things. They were constantly making me feel bad about myself and bully me. I think it was their goal to break us down. 

'And they were physically abusive, hitting and strangling us. They wanted to instill fear in the kids so we'd be too scared to disobey them.'

She added: 'I was having panic attacks and crying every single day. I was just so miserable. I felt like a prisoner and I hated life.' 

Three of her former classmates from Provo Canyon also appear in the documentary, making similar allegations, including the use of restraints and being force-fed medication. 

Hilton, who paved the way for the influencer generation, said she now feels a sense of relief and purpose coming forward with her story, which shines a light on the billion-dollar troubled teen industry, which she knows all too well. 

She said: 'I can't go to sleep at night knowing this is still happening to children and if I don't say anything, I don't know who will. I am figuring out ways to help and talk to survivors.'

 'I am using my voice and my platform to speak up for all of the children who have not been heard or have not been believed, and for anyone who was too scared to say anything because they felt ashamed.'

 'We are not the ones who should feel ashamed. These adults who are abusing children, and people who are manipulating families into putting children into these places where they are not safe, these are the ones who should feel ashamed.'

Hilton has also joined forces with the Breaking Code Silence movement aimed at supporting survivors and spreading awareness about the troubled teen industry. 

In addition to releasing her 28th fragrance, 19th product line and a third hotel property, the savvy businesswoman says she also has a new album coming out and is investing into a variety of new tech products.
