David cut a casual figure in a white slogan print tee paired with black trousers as he held onto a glass of wine and embraced Romeo.

Romeo, who looked trendy in a white tee and tan jeans laughed as Brooklyn appeared to lip-sync beside him. 

The good times continued to roll in the next photo captured by VB which showed David and eldest son Brooklyn cracking up with laughter as they relaxed on a sofa.

Fashion designer Victoria captioned the photo: 'My boys.'

A source told The Sun: 'Victoria hasn't touched a carb since 2001. But at the start of lockdown, David started experimenting with recipes — making the dough from scratch and trying various toppings.'

They added: 'Victoria eventually relented and had a small slice.
