There's a world of difference between Liam Hemsworth's ex-wife Miley Cyrus and his new girlfriend Gabriella Brooks. 

And this was certainly demonstrated on Sunday as Gabriella, 24, was spotted enjoying a low-key outing in Australia's trendy coastal town of Byron Bay, just hours before Miley, 27, flashed the flesh on the MTV VMAs red carpet. 

Gabriella, who has been dating Liam for eight months, covered up her slender frame in a white cotton singlet top and floaty lace mini-skirt.

She completed her bohemian look with a pair of oval-framed sunglasses, a woven handbag, brown woven sandals and a jumper which she slung over one arm. 

Gabriella appeared relaxed as she sipped on a smoothie and listened to music through her headphones.   

Just hours later, on the other side of the world, Miley was putting on a far more racy display as she attended the 2020 MTV VMAs in New York.

The Party In The USA singer left little to the imagination in a sheer off-the-shoulder dress with metallic sequin detailing. 

She wore matching gloves that reached up her arms, and covered her modesty with a black bandeau and matching underpants. 

Later, the songstress performed her new single Midnight Sky while swinging on a giant disco ball, once again wearing a very revealing outfit.

Liam and Miley called it quits in June last year after 'drifting apart', but they did not publicly confirm their split until two months later. 

The Hunger Games hunk was spotted for the first time with Gabriella in mid-December as they enjoyed a lunch date in Byron Bay with his parents, Craig and Leonie Hemsworth.   

In March, Us Weekly quoted an insider who alleged that  Liam 'feels more at home with Gabriella than he did with Miley and feels like he can be his complete self without any drama.'

Meanwhile, Liam has reportedly not spoken to Miley 'in months', Entertainment Tonight alleged earlier this month. 

'Miley and Liam spoke very little after their separation and any communication was more about making decisions regarding plans and property,' a source said.

'They haven't been in touch in months and it has been for the best because they have both needed this time to heal and move on.'
