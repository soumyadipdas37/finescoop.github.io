When it comes to cutting-edge design, these slick hotels hit the right note.  

They have all been longlisted in the hospitality architecture category in the prestigious Dezeen Awards 2020.

The list includes a very hip pet retreat for dogs and cats in Portugal, a cave complex in Santorini with dreamy views, a futuristic high-end resort in China and a hotel blending 'Swedish minimalism' with 'Japanese heritage design' in Tokyo's financial district.

Now in its third year, the awards, run by architecture and design website Dezeen, identify 'the world's best architecture, interiors and design', as well as the studios, architects and designers producing 'the most outstanding work'.

A jury, comprising a panel of international architects, designers and academics, will whittle the longlist down to a shortlist, which will be announced in September.

Scroll down to see some of the jaw-dropping properties that are in the running for the grand prize...
