Katie looked summery on the fall day in a floral print frock.

The dress had short sleeves and fell to mid-calf and she paired it with white sneakers.

The Dawson's Creek alum wore her brunette hair in a messy topknot and sported sunglasses and a disposable face mask.

She carried a pair of cellophane-wrapped sneakers along with her black shoulder purse.
