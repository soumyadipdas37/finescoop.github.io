Jenner served major bombshell vibes in a white Bottega Veneta shirt dress that she had customized to highlight her unique curves.

She had the waist taken in, some buttons down the front removed in order to expose more of her chest, and she shortened the length of the dress.

The Kylie Cosmetics founder had a chainlink pouch purse, a highly sought after Bottega Veneta accessory, tucked under her arm as she posed for photos at her Hidden Hills home.

To coordinate with the bag's eye-catching strap, Jenner wore a pair of gold chainlink earrings.

She slipped her feet into a pair of white heels, also by Bottega Veneta, that featured a triangular heel and espadrille-inspired ankle straps. 

Kylie had her hair parted down one side and she let her lengthy brunette strands flow down her back.

She opted for a more subdued version of her go-to makeup look, which included a neutral pink pout, some soft winged eyeliner, and a generous amount of pink blush.
