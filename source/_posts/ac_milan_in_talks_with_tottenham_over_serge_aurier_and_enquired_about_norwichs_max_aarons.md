AC Milan remain in talks with Tottenham for Serge Aurier and have enquired about Norwich City right back Max Aarons. 

Matt Doherty's arrival in North London will allow Aurier to move on this summer but the club are still to receive a suitable bid for the full back. 

The 20-year-old Aarons, meanwhile, is waiting to see if a move to Barcelona materialises.

The Serie A giants have also made an enquiry over highly-rated Norwich defender Max Aarons

The Spanish side have been negotiating for Ajax right-back Sergino Dest but face competition from Bayern Munich and Aarons is their back-up option. 

It was reported recently that they saw two shock bids for Aarons, including one worth £20m, rejected by Norwich.  

Roma are also keen on Aarons though Norwich want the same price tag guaranteed after dismissing loan offers. 

Aarons will feature against Bournemouth on Sunday afternoon after boss Daniel Farke insisted the player hasn't been affected by the speculation.

Meanwhile, Norwich City defender Akin Famewo has joined League One side Charlton Athletic on a season-long loan.
