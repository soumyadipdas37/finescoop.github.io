Bournemouth have tested their players for Covid ahead of Thursday night's League Cup clash with Manchester City, Sportsmail has learned.

The Cherries decided to bring in testing despite both clubs initially not deeming it necessary.

As previously reported, a number of Premier League clubs have offered to pay for their opponents to conduct the tests, while others have not.

Following discussions, City offered to pay for the Cherries – relegated from the top flight last season – to bring in testing. 

But the south coast club decided to stump up for it themselves and were tested this morning. They are hoping to receive the results before they set off for the Etihad Stadium tomorrow.

Bournemouth played at Middlesbrough, whose manager Neil Warnock has tested positive for the virus, on Saturday in front of 1,000 fans.

City and Bournemouth hold a strong relationship. In the summer, Pep Guardiola's side paid £41m for Cherries defender Nathan Ake and Bournemouth chairman Jeff Mostyn is a lifelong City fan.

Premier League players are tested frequently but that is not the case in the EFL, unless players have been on international duty.

On Tuesday night it emerged that West Ham manager David Moyes and tested positive before their match with Hull City, along with Hammers players Issa Diop and Josh Cullen, while Tottenham's clash with Leyton Orient was called off when the majority of the League Two Os squad did likewise. 

Spurs had paid for the tests, while Hull declined West Ham's offer to pay for theirs.

As reported this morning, Premier League clubs have been split on whether to pay for their opponents' testing. 

City's cross-town rivals United did not fork out for tests for Luton's players, ahead of last night's fixture at Kenilworth Road.
