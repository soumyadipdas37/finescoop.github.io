On Wednesday, Texas-born London, who recently moved to the Gold Coast to live with Reece, also shared a lengthy statement on her Instagram story explaining that she'll be posting about her pregnancy journey on another platform, before linking to her OnlyFans account. 

'I'm so excited that I can finally share with y'all the news that I'm PREGNANT!!!' London's post began.

She said she made the decision to post on OnlyFans because over the years she and Reece have been 'harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action.'   

London said she'd be posting 'updates, gender reveal and more intimate photos of me and Reece' online. 

OnlyFans is a subscription-based adult website where content can range from something as innocent as a suggestive selfie, all the way to hardcore pornography.  London is charging fans $14.99 a month for content.
