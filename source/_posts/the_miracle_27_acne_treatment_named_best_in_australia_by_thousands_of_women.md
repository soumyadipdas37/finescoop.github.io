A $27 acne treatment has been crowned the best in Australia by thousands of women who say it's a 'miracle' life-saving product.

The Mario Badescu Drying Lotion was preferred against competitors at the 2020 Mecca Beauty Election for its ability to fight breakouts overnight.

The spot treatment works to dry surface blemishes and reduce redness or inflammation while you sleep.

It's ideal to use when blackheads or whiteheads surface on the skin.

A $27 acne treatment has been crowned the best in Australia by thousands of women who say it's a 'miracle life-saving' product 

The popular product is vegan, sulphate-free and uses a rich blend of ingredients to fight against acne - including sulfur, zinc oxide and isopropyl alcohol.  

Only a small amount of the solution is needed to clear the skin, and Mecca encourages customers to apply the solution to the surface of the blemish using a cotton bud.

'There's a reason why the Drying Lotion has been a medicine cabinet staple for over 50 years: it's the original bi-phase, on-the-spot solution that targets surface blemishes while you sleep,' a Mario Badescu team member said online.

'I have been using it on my skin for three days and all my blemishes have almost completely vanished! Nothing seems to work with my skin and I was so amazed at the results from this product!' one happy customer said on the Mecca website.

'Perfect product for my teenage daughters skin to clear up or reduce spots!!' another said.

'This is a must have for any girl that gets any pimple - pop it on at the end of your night time routine,' a third added.

Runners-up in the 'Best for Acne' category included the Sunday Riley UFO Ultra-Clarifying Face Oil, GlamGlow's Supermud Clearing Treatment and Kate Somerville's EradiKate Daily Cleaner.

Each runner-up is more expensive in price compared to Mario Badescu's Drying Lotion, with prices varying between $61 and $128.

Customers can purchase all products from the Mecca website or store locations.
