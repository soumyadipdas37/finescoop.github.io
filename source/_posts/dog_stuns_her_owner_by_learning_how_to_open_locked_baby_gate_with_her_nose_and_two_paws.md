A dog owner in Canada was left baffled when her two pets kept appearing upstairs - despite having installed a safety gate to stop them

Joy Hattie thought she was 'losing her marbles' when her two dogs, Sadie and Sophie, kept showed up behind her upstairs while she was folding laundry. 

The mystery was solved when she set up a camera and caught her mischievous pooch Sophie red handed, opening the locked baby gate with her nose and two paws.  

Joy, a teacher in Morinville, Alberta, Canada, had installed the baby gate across the stairs to stop her two pets, Sadie and Sophie, from getting her new carpet dirty.  

However the teacher was left baffled when the pair kept appearing upstairs - despite her being convinced she had locked the gate behind her. 

As it continued to happen, Joy blamed herself for keeping the security gate open, until she spotted the real culprit in action in amazing footage.

Standing at the top of the staircase, Joy filmed as her pet Sophie, a great Pyrenees Shar-Pei cross, lifted the clasp over the gate.

At first the white pooch put her nose under one end and lifted it slightly before wedging it upright by placing her right front paw on the hinge.

The clever one-year-old then moved her left paw under the raised clasp and simultaneously pulled back on the railings to open the door widely.

Once the barrier was wide open, Sophie and her two-year-old sister Sadie - a Labrador white shepherd cross - followed through and trotted up the stairs.

 'I genuinely thought I was losing my mind,' said Joy. The pair of them would be stood behind me and I'd look downstairs and see the gate open.

'In our home, the upstairs was freshly carpeted so the baby gate was there to help keep things clean. 

'Sophie and Sadie are allowed upstairs with us but did not have free reign.

'I noticed when going upstairs to put away laundry, a few minutes later Sophie would appear.

'I thought I was losing my marbles when I'd see the gate open and blamed myself for not latching it.

'Sadie could always jump the gate but wouldn't because she's the 'good girl'. Sophie prefers to solve problems her own way, and avoid physical exertion like jumping.

'I decided to see what was happening and hid in the bathroom at the top of the stairs with my phone out. This is the result!

'I was not surprised at all when I discovered what she was doing. Sophie is a dog who tries to catch balls with her front paws instead of her mouth.

'She's very clever and mischievous and makes us laugh every day.'
