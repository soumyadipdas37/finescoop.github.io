A French woman has discovered a deadly redback spider inside of her shoe after moving to the affluent harbourside suburb of Mosman.

She shared the startling discovery to a local community page on Sydney's North Shore on Thursday.

'It was found in a shoe...lucky no one got hurt,' the woman said.

The woman revealed she was looking for a way to remove the spider from her home. 

She asked if there was somewhere to take the 'beautiful' female spider, either a vet or an interested insect expert.

Other social media users said there was no harm in returning the spider to the garden, while others suggested calling the zoo as they could use the venom for research.

Redbacks are also called the Australian black widow and are believed to have originated in South Australia.

The spiders can be found throughout the country, New Zealand and south-east Asia and their venom is highly poisonous.
