Australia's first recession in 29 years was confirmed as COVID-19 clusters grew in Sydney, while the Queensland premier came under fire during an eventful day in Australia's fight against the virus. 

In what Prime Minister Scott Morrison described as a 'heartbreaking blow' on Wednesday, the country's gross domestic product shrank 7 per cent in the three months to June.

Meanwhile, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard took aim at Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for 'putting people's lives at risk' by keeping the state border closed.  

Here's the latest.  

Australia entered its first recession in thirty years as GDP fell by 6.3 per cent in the year to June, with treasurer Josh Fyrdenberg (pictured releasing GDP figures) saying Australians faced a 'hard and bumpy road'
