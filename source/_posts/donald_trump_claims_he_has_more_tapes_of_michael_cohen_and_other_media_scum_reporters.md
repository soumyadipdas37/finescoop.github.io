President Donald Trump took a swipe Tuesday at former lawyer Michael Cohen who is promoting a tell-all book – claiming Cohen may land back in jail and claiming there are 'many more' tapes of him and 'media scum reporters.'

Trump called his former enforcer and lawyer at the Trump Organization 'deranged and sick' after Cohen gave an interview where he said Trump was like a cult leader and Cohen was swept into it.

The president issued the online threat while retweeting a story from last week about newly revealed audio recordings of Cohen on the phone with CNN's Chris Cuomo where Cuomo denies sexually harassing coworkers.

'Fredo’s got a convicted lier for a lawyer, who may be going back to jail for an even longer time - additional lies to Congress,' Trump said – using his 'Godfather'-derived insult for Cuomo, the son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. 

'Many more tapes of him with Fredo and other media scum reporters. Reveals how deranged & sick they all are!' Trump said.

Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty for lying to Congress as well as tax and campaign finance violations.

The campaign finance violations related to payments Cohen facilitated to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Trump. Trump denies the affair, although he reimbursed Cohen for the payments. 

Trump did not provide any evidence for saying Cohen may be going back to prison or that he uncovered additional false testimony that he did not already plead guilty to. 

In a clip from an interview airing Tuesday evening, Cohen told NBC's Lester Holt: 'I describe Mr. Trump as a cult leader, and I was in this cult.'

'While I was in the cult, I was really refusing to acknowledge that the actions I was performing for my boss were morally wrong,' he said. 

It was just the latest slap at his former boss. In his book, Disloyal: A Memoir, Cohen claims Trump at one point hired a 'Faux-Bama' lookalike to star in a bizarre video in which he 'ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him'.

Cohen also claims Trump met with evangelical leaders at Trump Tower shortly after his election - before allegedly turning to his 'fixer' and telling Cohen: 'Can you believe people believe that bulls***?'
