England are braced for the likelihood of a player breaching Covid-19 protocols if they are forced to operate in a ‘severe biosphere’ for their autumn campaign — although that is in doubt.

The RFU hierarchy have been alerted to the inevitability of a member — or members — of the squad failing to adhere to isolation guidelines throughout their long spell in the camp.

England are due to base themselves in a familiar hotel close to Twickenham, which is due to take place in November.

England have strict plans for what head coach Eddie Jones called a ‘severe biosphere’

If Six Nations officials allow such flexibility, it is understood that England will relax their strict plans for what head coach Eddie Jones called a ‘severe biosphere’.

Meanwhile, after reports that South Africa were destined to take the place in the eight-nations tournament vacated by Japan, Sportsmail has learned that Georgia will be the side to fill the void, in a pool also containing France, Italy and Scotland.
