A devastated father-of-four has spoken of his heartbreak after losing his teenage son and his partner in the space of six months.

Chris Kelly and his partner Kim Clarke, from Liverpool, lost their son Nick in March this year, to a suspected allergic reaction. 

The 16-year-old collapsed at his family home, moments after eating a takeaway kebab.  

Kim, 36, suffered a sudden brain bleed and passed away on Sunday 13 September.

Chris, 45, says: 'Losing a child is every parent's worst nightmare. I certainly think the stress of losing our son contributed to Kim's death.

'My only comfort is that they are both together now and she can look after him.

'We have three other children, and I have to be strong for them. I will do Kim proud.

'Kim had been complaining of headaches the previous week but had insisted she was fine. 

'I look back and wish she had gone to hospital, perhaps they could have saved her. But it's too late now to change anything.'

Nick's nut allergy was discovered at the age of two when his parents gave him a peanut butter sandwich and he had a severe allergic reaction. 

Throughout his childhood, he had no further problems.

Chris says: 'Nick was always really careful. He checked everything before he ate it. 

'He never had a bad reaction at all – until this. He had never had to use an epi-pen. It was so well managed.'

But Kim discovered her son foaming at the mouth after eating a takeaway kebab on March 11.

He turned blue and screamed 'I can't breathe' and was rushed to hospital where he was on a ventilator for four nights before his death.

Chris, who is also dad to Joe, 17, Tiffany, 13, and Cheryl, 11, says: 'It all happened so fast, he was saying he couldn't breathe, panicking. Our eldest son gave him CPR.

'We were devastated when he died. It was so hard to carry on, but Kim tried to be strong for our other children. We pulled together.'

Nick was the second eldest of the couple's four children and was a lively, happy boy who loved football and adored his girlfriend, Paisley, 17. 

The family were forced to hold a scaled-down burial for Nick without a church service, with just 10 people at the graveside, due to the coronavirus lockdown.

Merseyside Police launched a joint investigation into Nick's death with Knowsley Council.

Last week, Kim began complaining of headaches and Chris contacted his GP who advised them to attend A and E.

Chris says: 'I tried to get Kim to go to hospital, but she said it wasn't that serious. 

'She took some paracetamol and insisted she was fine. That was typical of her, she didn't like to make a fuss.'

But by Friday she was in so much pain that Chris called an ambulance. She passed away two days later with Chris at her bedside, at the age of 36. 

Doctors also found she had undiagnosed leukaemia.

Chris says: 'It feels surreal, I can't believe she has gone. I have to be strong for our other three children, it's what she would want. 

'But it's so hard. I wake up every morning and see she isn't there and it breaks my heart all over again.

'Kim will be buried with Nick and it is my only comfort that they will be together again and she can look after him in heaven. She missed him so much.'

A fundraiser has been set up to help pay costs towards Kim's funeral. It has so far raised £3,345 of its £3,500 goal. To donate click here.
