A student teacher who would spend $160-a-week on takeaway meals has revealed how she dropped four dress sizes - without depriving herself of all the 'naughty' food she loves.

Renee Roberts, from Sydney, lived off a McDonald's, KFC and takeaway-heavy diet - an unhealthy lifestyle that saw her weight spiralled to 105kg.

The 21-year-old said she would go through a 'vicious cycle' of dieting but would later find herself secretly eating a KFC Zinger box meal alone in her car before driving home just in time to enjoy a 'massive dinner with a side of chocolate'.

Determined to get on top of her weight once and for all, she shed 35 kilos within 12 months just by counting her macros rather than follow strict diets.

'This might come as a surprise... but I have been taught how to have your cake and eat it too,' Renee told Daily Mail Australia.

She credits 'flexible dieting' for her size 10 physique where she eats 80 per cent wholefoods and 20 per cent of anything she wants - within reason.

Before her weight loss, the young woman - who wore size 18 clothing - actually stopped weighing herself after she saw the three digits on the scale.

'I was so ashamed and disappointed in myself that I decided to direct the blame to the scales,' she said.

'I thought that if I just stopped looking at the numbers, the problem would go away and it would stop the overwhelming upset that it caused me to feel.'

Renee said her biggest expenditure was takeaway meals.

'I was personally funding my Uber Eats drivers' new car by ordering takeaway a minimum of four times a week. I was spending an average of $160 a week plus buying my own groceries on top of it,' she said. 

Her turning point to lose weight came after she realised she needed to opt for a size 20 after she couldn't fit into her favourite size 18 blue denim skirt

Before her weight loss, Renee said she had an 'extremely unhealthy lifestyle with poor eating habits to match' when she was at her heaviest weight of 105 kilos

She tried every diet imaginable to lose weight - but nothing seemed to work. 

'I was a yo-yo dieter, trying everything from Keto, to weight loss shakes, extreme restriction, eating clean with a cheat day and my personal favourite - only eating meat on Tuesdays and Thursdays,' she recalled. 

'I was in this vicious cycle of dieting like a mad women for a week, then having an insane blow where I eat anything and everything I could get my hands on... before deciding to re-try next month.

'I was paying for a gym membership that I didn't use and going out eating and drinking with my friends twice a week.' 

Renee said she became fixated with social media influencers.

'I would watch fitness and health YouTubers thinking that it would influence me but instead I would sit on my bed for hours on end watching them in envy as I sat there eating my takeaway and never committing to a change,' she said. 

The 21-year-old (pictured with her boyfriend during her weight loss) said she believed her weight gain was 'ultimately caused by my sheer lack of control' 

Determined to get on top of her weight once and for all, she shed 35 kilos within 12 months just by counting her macros rather than follow strict diets

It took her over a year to shed 35 kilos altogether - and lose a total of 81.9 cm all over her body

She believed her weight gain was caused by her 'sheer lack of control when it came to the amount of food I was consuming'. 

'I remember days where I would eat no breakfast, binge out at lunch and say to myself that I would start my extremely restrictive diet tomorrow, drive into a KFC or a Maccas drive-thru after work and quickly eat it in the car before I got home and would then eat a massive dinner with a side of chocolates,' she said. 

'This was a constant unhealthy cycle that I tried time and time again to break without success and due to this lack of success, I would get upset with myself and eat my feelings away.' 

As she struggled with body image and self-confidence, Renee said she felt deterred from shopping for size-18 clothing.

'When I was at my biggest, I found it very hard to find clothes at my favourite shops as the largest size they'd stock would be a size 16,' she said.

'This resulted in me developing a hate for trying things on in store as I didn't want the people working in the change rooms to know I couldn't fit into the pieces I selected.

'Once I took them home and they fit, I would cut the tags off my clothes so people didn't see what size they were. 

'Overall I feel like my body was a result of how I felt inside instead of the other way around, the way I looked definitely added to what I was feeling however I believe my heaviest weight reflected a time in my life where I was at my lowest.'

Since her weight loss, Renee said she feels happier about herself more than ever

The student teacher revealed she would spend $160-a-week on takeaway meals 

But her turning point to lose weight came when she realised she needed to opt for a size 20 after she couldn't fit into her favourite size 18 blue denim skirt. 

'I remember being late to pick up my boyfriend for the event we were going to because I simply just couldn't stop crying, it was like the realisation finally hit me in. The face like a truck and I knew that I needed to make a change,' she said. 

'A fire started in my belly, determined to never ever feel that way and I started writing down all the things I wanted to change or incorporate into my life. The top of the list was to learn about food and the second was exercise.'

At first, she assumed weight loss programs were expensive but after going through her bank statements, she discovered the large amount of money she was spending on takeaway meals every week.

'I soon realised my problem was the fact that I wasn't prioritising my health,' she said.

'Not only was I wasting so much money on food each week, I was wasting so much time and energy being trapped in such a negative cycle.'

And so she turned to Equalution - a science-based nutrition program which involves meeting daily targets of macronutrients - protein, carbohydrate and fat - that have been calculated based on the dieter's age, gender, activity level and any condition.

'I have learnt so much about food and nutrition from the team that has helped me develop a positive relationship with food. Seeing food as fuel and energy instead of the enemy,' she said.

'I was learning how to count my macros. I didn't feel as I was eating less though. I was eating more if anything, just not as calorie dense.'

Renee said she now enjoys six meals a day without restricting herself of her favourite food

BREAKFAST: Cafe-style avocado on toast with poached eggs

MORNING SNACK: Ham, lettuce, cream cheese and tomato toast

LUNCH: Beef ragu pasta

AFTERNOON SNACK: Frozen yoghurt with mixed berries

DINNER: Coconut crusted chicken with Asian veggie noodle salad

DESSERT: Classic Magnum ice cream

Total: 1,900 calories

It took her over a year to shed 35 kilos altogether - and lose a total of 81.9 cm all over her body. 

'I currently weigh 70kg and am shocked to be buying size 10 or small in clothing,' she said.

Renee said she now enjoys six meals a day without restricting herself.

'I have become more informed about the decisions I am making in regards to food and eating, resulting in me being able to make better food decisions that are align with my goals without restricting myself,' she said. 

'I still eat pizza, pasta, rice, chocolate, ice cream and takeaway, regularly going out for social events which I love because what's life if you can't eat the things you love with the people you love. I am currently on 1,900 calories per day.'

She said she no longer feels 'guilty' when she treats herself to her favourite foods.

'Honestly, I don't have guilty pleasure foods anymore as I eat dessert every night and still have pasta, rice, burgers and pizza so I never really feel like I'm missing out or indulge in a guilty pleasure food as I eat it every day,' she said.

'In saying that, I still love going out and getting some dumplings with my boyfriend, going to local cafes with my friends and indulging in that juicy Zinger burger.'

Since her weight loss, Renee said she feels happier about herself more than ever

Her exercises included F45 which involves a mix of cardio and weight training between three to six days a week and walking at least 10,000 steps a day.

Since her weight loss, Renee - who documents her astonishing weight loss journey on Instagram - said she feels happier about herself more than ever. 

'I have never loved the body I am blessed with more than I do right now, I feel so confident and full of appreciation for what I have accomplished,' she said.

'I frequently look back at progress photos and cry, not because I am sad but because I just get an overwhelming sense of pride and happiness. 

'I genuinely get shocked sometimes and have a habit of occasionally buying clothes that are too big for me or are the wrong size simply because I still get shocked that I am able to buy a small or a size 10. 

'I have been able to grow into the person I was supposed to become, full of self love, confidence and a body positivity. I now feel whole and have a zest for life, finally enjoying myself and emerged fully in the moments I am without wanting to hide.' 

For those looking to lose weight, Renee said: 'Stop making excuses for why you can't and start telling yourself that you can, start being your own hype person, change those thoughts and start showing up like the person you want to be.'
