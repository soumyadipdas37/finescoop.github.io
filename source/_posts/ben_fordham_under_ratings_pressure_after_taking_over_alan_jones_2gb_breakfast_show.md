The radio personality previously revealed that he did not initially want the job and it was his wife, Jodie Speers, who ultimately made the decision for him. 

Speaking to Stellar Magazine, the 43-year-old says that turned down the role multiple times as he was not sure that it was 'best for his family'. 

'I totally appreciate that the job itself is a spectacular one. But make no mistake, it's not one I was chasing for family reasons. I just wasn't.

'I was concerned about the impact it would have on the family setup. And I suppose I just thought it would be easier not to. I think I said no about six times,' he admitted. 

Ben was ultimately swayed by the realisation that his new schedule would allow him to pick up his  son, Freddy, five, from school, and the endorsement of Jodie, 37.

He explained: 'I lean on her heavily. And I gave her a deadline and said, 'Listen, if you change your mind and say no, I will never hold it against you.''

Jodie told Stellar: 'I knew he had to take it, but I probably had a bit of a knot in my stomach trying to process it'.  

Ben recently took his older children, son Freddy, five, and daughter Pearl, three, out of school due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Ben and Jodie, who were married in 2011, welcomed their third child, a daughter, Marigold 'Goldie' Jean, in September last year.
