Victoria Beckham appeared to brush off speculation she and her husband David secretly had coronavirus in March with her latest Instagram snap on Tuesday.

The fashion designer, 46, took to Instagram to show her followers how to wear her latest VB collection just a day after it was claimed the couple had caught coronavirus in March, while jetting between the United States and the United Kingdom.   

According to the report, the football legend, 45, and his wife feared they were 'super-spreaders' after several of their staff also caught the virus, following two weeks spent jetting across the globe with their children.

However Victoria failed to address the speculation in her latest post, as she shared a glimpse a selection of new pieces from her self-titled label.

The mother-of-four looked super stylish in the Instagram reel, which showed her wearing a white blouse and checked blazer.

She teamed it with a striking purple midi skirt, which boasted a gold chain draped across the waist, and a pair of green boots.

Victoria captioned the clip: 'Trying out Reels to show you how I’m wearing some of my go-to pieces for the new season x vb.'

The clip comes following reports from the Sun that the Beckham's and some members of their staff caught coronavirus earlier this year.

The pair split their time between the States and the UK between March 5 and 19, travelling from Los Angeles to London to the Cotswolds to Miami and then back to the Cotswolds, with no way of knowing when in their travels they contracted the virus.

The Beckhams began the month in Los Angeles to watch David's football club, Inter Milan FC take on Los Angeles FC in an away game. 

The group then headed out on plenty of network and schmoozing events packed with people. 

Days later, on March 5, the family flew into London and then travelled to their second home in the Cotswolds to celebrate son Brooklyn's 21st birthday. 

The family held a lavish £100,000 bash on March 7 at their home, which was attended by the likes of his fiancee Nicola Peltz, Emma Bunton, Gordon and Tana Ramsay's daughter Holly and rapper Stormzy.

Following the party, the jet-setting family returned to the States as they travelled to Miami for the week.

At some point after returning home both David and Victoria develop coronavirus symptoms and quarantine for more than two weeks

Whilst there, David attended a swanky party attended by the likes of rapper Pharrell before overseeing business with his Inter Milan club. 

Just a few days later, the family - excluding eldest son Brooklyn - returned to the UK to stay in their Cotswolds home on March 19, four days before the country went into lockdown.  

However, it is claimed that upon their return the father-of-four began to feel unwell, while Victoria developed a sore throat and a high temperature soon after.

A source told The Sun: 'It was an absolute nightmare scenario,' explaining how David was in LA schmoozing on behalf of his club Inter Miami, when Victoria and their children flew over to support him.

'They attended a couple of swanky networking events as David had promotional duties, and were shaking hands and kissing fans and various club dignitaries,' claimed the insider. 

The source claimed that several of the Beckhams' team, including drivers, bodyguards and PAs - also fell ill, 'a couple of them very badly so'.

According to the insider, Victoria 'really panicked' and forced the entire family to quarantine rigidly for more than the required two week period, defined by the UK government. 

'She was utterly petrified they might be super-spreaders, and did all she could to minimise all future risk,' said the source.  

It has also been claimed that, after making full recoveries, the couple checked in regularly with their team.

They allegedly sent 'care packages' to at least two staff members who were particularly badly affected. 

The Beckhams then spent lockdown quarantined in their country manor, which boasts a swimming pool, hot tub, and of course a football pitch.

Their decision to spend lockdown in their second home angered neighbours, who accused them of being 'selfish'.  

One woman who works at the butchers near their home in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, said: 'The Beckhams and these other fancy folks who think it's a good idea to self-isolate in the country are just being selfish.'

A local councillor added: 'Showing off your beautiful country mansion on social media and telling us all what a wonderful time you're having is just rubbing our noses in it. The Beckhams and other celebrities are just being stupid, irresponsible and insensitive.'

Other local workers said the famous couple would have to wait their turn at local shops while the vulnerable and elderly were served first. 

Although they spent a lot of time there on a regular basis, they had been bombarding their followers with pictures and videos of enjoying a luxurious lockdown in their palatial surrounds.

So many videos were posted on their feeds that locals branded their stay 'selfie-isolation.'

However, the Beckhams defended their decision to spend lockdown in the country manor due to the fact they had already arrived there before the government issued the lockdown order on March 23.   

Following their recovery from COVID-19, Victoria and David are said to have had swab and antibody tests to ensure they no longer had the virus, before jetting off on holiday to Greece and Italy. 

David Beckham's representatives declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.

Lockdown! By March 19, the Beckhams (minus eldest child Brooklyn) were once again back in the Cotswolds, where they spent lockdown together
