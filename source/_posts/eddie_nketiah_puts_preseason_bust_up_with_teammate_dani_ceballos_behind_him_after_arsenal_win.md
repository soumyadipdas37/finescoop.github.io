Eddie Nketiah insists 'it's all love' between himself and team-mate Dani Ceballos after the Arsenal pair put an angry clash behind them to combine for the winning goal against West Ham.

Mikel Arteta's side made it two wins from two on Saturday night as the Gunners saw off London rivals West Ham 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium to extend their good start to the 2020-21 campaign. 

England U21 star Nketiah and Real Madrid loanee Ceballos clashed in pre-season training after the striker was felled by a heavy challenge dished out by the Spaniard during preparations for the new season.

However, the pair combined in the final knockings of the game on Saturday, with Ceballos teeing up Nketiah to net the all-important winner.

Nketiah rewarded Arteta's faith in the youngster, as the boss turned to the academy product to change the game on the 77th minute, and made the vital contribution.

And Nketiah hailed his team-mate Ceballos, saying that 'it's all love' between the two Arsenal stars now.  

'We had a bit of a coming together,' the 21-year-old told Sky Sports. 'The reaction was there. We made up and got on with it. It was nice for him to make the assist. It's all love now.

'It was a great pass across, good vision. I tried to stay onside. It was an easy finish from there.

'I want to keep improving as a player. It's a great feeling to come on and score. 

'West Ham made it very difficult. They came out very strongly in the second half.' 

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta heaped praise on his young striker following the win on Saturday

Arteta hailed his young striker, who has played an important role since returning from a loan spell with Leeds, after the win over the Hammers. 

'Eddie can do that every week. He's hungry and has a great quality to score goals,' he told BBC Sport.

'I'm thrilled with the three points. I said before the game how difficult it would be with the way they play.
