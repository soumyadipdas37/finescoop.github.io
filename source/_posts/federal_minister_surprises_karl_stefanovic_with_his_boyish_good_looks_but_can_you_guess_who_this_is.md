Josh Frydenberg's boyish good looks have been compared to the likes of Hollywood A-lister Zac Efron. 

The Australian Treasurer was likened to the High School Musical star when presented with a 'handsome' picture of his young self while appearing on Today on Friday.

Presenter Karl Stefanovic was stunned when he saw pictures of the 49-year-old sporting a mullet in a white polo shirt. 

Mr Frydenberg appeared on the show to speak about the upcoming Federal Budget as well as the recent drop in unemployment figures.

'We're featuring Australia's first live mullet after the break,' co-host Karl Stefanovic said.

'Now, going back a couple of years, Treasurer, look at that. We managed to dig this one up.

'Look at you, you look at Zac Efron. What a handsome rooster.'

Today hosts were then lost for words when another picture followed, showing a younger, topless Mr Frydenberg.

The father-of-two appears to be in his mid twenties.

'Woah. Put the gear on,' Stefanovic said, which was echoed by co-host Sylvia Jeffreys.

'We asked for a mullet, not a six pack,' she said.

Mr Frydenberg said he had 'no idea' he was going to be presented with the flashback as he smiled and started to go red from embarrassment on screen. 

'Oh my goodness,' he said.

'I'm lost for words but Karl you know the saying: god created a few perfect heads and the rest he put hair on.'

Stefanovic ended the segment calling Mr Frydenberg a 'hot enchilada'.

'I had no idea,' he said. 'Treasurer, stop it.'
