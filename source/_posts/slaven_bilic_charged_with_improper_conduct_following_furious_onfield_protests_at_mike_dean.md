West Brom manager Slaven Bilic has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association.

The Croatian boss came onto the pitch at half-time in his side's defeat to Everton on Saturday and was shown a red card by referee Mike Dean for his protests.

The FA has now decided to charge him over the incident.

'Slaven Bilic has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3,' a governing body statement read.

'It is alleged that the West Bromwich Albion FC manager's language and/or behaviour on the field of play at half-time of the Premier League fixture against Everton amounts to improper conduct.'

The FA statement added that Bilic had until Thursday to respond.

Bilic was unhappy with Dean's decision to send off Kieran Gibbs just before the break

Bilic came onto the pitch following the first-half dismissal of Kieran Gibbs for pushing Everton's James Rodriguez in the face.

Bilic said of the incident that led to his own red card: 'As a manager I should be in a situation to ask the referee what's going on.

'I didn't swear. I asked him in a frustrated way but I didn't go over the line but he just ignored me and gave me red. I told him 'if you want to kill us, kill us'. That's all.'

The 52-year-old was made to watch from the stands as West Brom lost 5-2 to Everton

He was fined Â£2,000 in August 2019 after being sent to the stands during a Championship match against Derby.

In February 2017 he was fined Â£8,000 after admitting an FA misconduct charge during his time at West Ham. He was sent off for protesting about a goal scored by West Brom, throwing a television mic to the ground in frustration.
