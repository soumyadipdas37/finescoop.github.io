Yellow Wiggle Emma Watkins has just bought a new puppy with her musician boyfriend, Oliver Brian. 

The 30-year-old was spotted holding the adorable pet pooch on Tuesday, as she and Oliver loaded belongings into their car in Sydney, where they are based. 

It comes after Emma sweetly congratulated her ex-husband, Purple Wiggle Lachy Gillespie, on the birth of his twins with his ballet dancer fiancée, Dana Stephensen.
