One wrote: 'Good quality mirror, super clarity but wow that zoom is ruthless. First time I've ever had a mirror with magnifier and lights. Ok. First thing to learn is that you never, ever look at the magnified side when you are 57 years old. It's ruthless! 

The sleek minimalist design comes with a double sided mirror and 360 degree swivel so you can angle it at any position
