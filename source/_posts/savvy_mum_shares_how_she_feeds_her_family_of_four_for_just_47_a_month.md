A savvy mum has revealed how she manages to cook a month-worth of meals and snacks for her family-of-four for just £47.

Mary Bells, from Torquay, Devon, posted a picture to Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK Facebook Group and showed off her impressive array of batch cooked dinners which feed her husband and two children, who she says all have 'very different dietary requirements'.

The snap included the likes of lasagne, curry, Bombay potatoes, chicken and chorizo pasta and kofta kebabs, all of which can be frozen and reheated.

'All made with bargain meat and veg brought from the bargain isle so a grand total of £47 this will feed four of us for at least 30 days,' she wrote on the post accompanying the photo.

'That's September sorted, sorry kitchen but I won't be back for some time,' she added to the post, which has now been liked more than 5,600 times.

The post quickly gathered the attention of thousands of bargain hunters who were quick to comment on the savvy mother's handy hacks. 



'Wow this is great super woman,' wrote one.

'Incredible!! You are one amazing woman!' added another.

'Can I come and live with you?' asked a third. 

'When you have two kids with different dietary requirements, you're on a diet and both you and your husband are off to uni/college next week, it’s time to batch cook the hell out of life,' Mary explained, adding she wouldn't be doing any cooking for a month.
