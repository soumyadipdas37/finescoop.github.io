A flat-earther couple who tried to 'sail to the edge of the world' during lockdown had to be rescued by a maritime doctor who usually saves migrants.

The pair, from Venice, attempted to travel to Lampedusa, an island between Sicily and North Africa which has become a prime transit point for migrants wanting to enter Europe.

The conspiracy theorists believed the edge of the world fell near the island and they wanted to see it.

They sold their car to buy the boat in Termini Imerese, a town in northern Sicily, before they set off on their journey.

But the couple surprisingly never made it to the end of the world, nor even Lampedusa, instead getting lost near the island of Ustica, off the north coast of Sicily.

Salvatore Zichichi, a doctor of the maritime health office of the Ministry of Health, helped the pair after they got lost. 

He told Italian news outlet La Stampa that he pointed out the irony of the couple using a compass in their unsuccessful navigation.

He said: 'The funny thing is that they orient themselves with the compass, an instrument that works on the basis of terrestrial magnetism

'A principle that they, as Flat Earthers, should reject.' 

As they broke lockdown restrictions, they were taken into quarantine in Palermo for two weeks.

But they tried to escape, only for the port authority to stop them three hours later and bring them back into quarantine.

They tried to escape again, and were caught again, and finally decided to see out the two weeks of isolation.

They have since abandoned their quest and took a ferry back to mainland Italy.
