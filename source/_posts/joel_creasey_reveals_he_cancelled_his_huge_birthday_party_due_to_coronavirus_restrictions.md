Joel Creasey has been forced to cancel his 30th birthday party due to Melbourne's coronavirus restrictions.

In an interview with Stellar Magazine, the 30-year-old revealed he was planning to host a 'huge event' and invite Jessica Mauboy or Guy Sebastian to perform but had to cancel due to lockdown restrictions.

'The original plan, pre-corona, was a huge party, like a music festival. I was going to fly in a Broadway actress, get Jessica Mauboy or Guy Sebastian,' he said.

He added: 'Then I had to downsize to 30 people at home, with a pianist and Christie Whelan Browne to sing.'

'And it ended up being my boyfriend Jack Stratton-Smith and I having a champagne at 9am and drunkenly singing karaoke to each other. But all things considered it was quite nice,' he said. 

Joel celebrated his 30th birthday on August 11th.

'I turned 30 today or ''gay dead'' as my community affectionately call it,' Joel wrote on Instagram, referring to the milestone of exiting his 20s.

'The belter of a party I'd spent about a year planning slowly got paired back to just Jack (who turned 27 yesterday) and I having lunch at home,' he added.

Joel then went on to speak about the coronavirus pandemic.

'It's been a very bizarre 48 hours. So given the postponement I've decided I'll stay 29 and try again next year,' he joked.

He continued: 'However I've genuinely had a truly wonderful day and have been sent some outrageously special gifts by some even more outrageously special people.' 

'Turns out the key to a successful iso-birthday is to drink hard, drink often and drink early! And now I can go to bed,' he finished.
