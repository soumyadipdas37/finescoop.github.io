It seems that Sam Frost's Home and Away character has a hunky new love interest. 

On Tuesday, the 31-year-old actress was spotted filming scenes for the hit show at Sydney's Palm Beach, with new co-star Luke Arnold. 

Sam looked like the ultimate beach babe as she and Luke, 36, shared a steamy kiss while on set.

Sam, who plays Jasmine Delaney on the long-running soap, wore her long blonde locks out and over her shoulders in messy curls. 

Her makeup was complete with thick foundation, layers of blush, lashings of mascara and a nude lip.

'When I'm losing or gaining weight it's all over the news, but this is for a greater cause,' she says of the charity burlesque show.

'Might as well strip off on TV right? That'll fix it,' she joked.

The former Bachelor star recently admitted that she has battled with body image her entire life. 

'I'd like to say I feel comfortable in my body, but the truth is body image is something that I've battled with my whole life,' she told The Daily Telegraph on Monday.

'I don't want to be like that.

'I'm trying to get more comfortable in my own skin, and I'm trying really hard to push away those insecurities,' she added.
