She was there to see on the ground how the nonprofit's educational support and disaster relief efforts are helping those in need. 

A video clip shows her meeting with Big Sandy Rancheria’s Tribal Chairperson Liz Kipp and Darlene Franco, Director of Native Wellness for Fresno American Indian Health Project.

In a lengthy Instagram post, the star of Alias and Miracles From Heaven described meeting with Native American families last week who have been hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic by destructive wildfires

'[I] met families whose homeschool plan (because, pandemic) turned, in a moment’s time, to homeschooling three kids in different grades in a tiny hotel room (because, fire/evacuation),' she wrote. 'The strength and resilience of families up against it always leaves me inspired; I am grateful to be trusted with so many stories'

Garner continued: 'On this trip I saw capable and loving leadership from Big Sandy Rancheria’s Tribal Chairperson Liz Kipp, I helped deliver a celebrated truckload of necessities from friend of Save the Children @baby2baby, and I participated in a prayer and offering to the burned tribal land, led by Darlene Franco.'

She concluded: 'All of this sent me home feeling extra grateful and certain of the good in our beautiful country.'  

Generous: The actress and mom of three also brought along a consignment of 'necessities' donated to local families by the LA-based charity Baby2Baby

Encouraged her fans to donate to disaster relief: 'The strength and resilience of families up against it always leaves me inspired,' she shared on Instagram. 'All of this sent me home feeling extra grateful and certain of the good in our beautiful country'
