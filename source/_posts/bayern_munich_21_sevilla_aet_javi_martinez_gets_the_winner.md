Bayern Munich were tested by Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup, but the Champions League winners came from behind to win it in extra-time thanks to a Javi Martinez strike. 

Sevilla would not back down against the German giants, winning a penalty early on after David Alaba bundled over Ivan Rakitic in the box. Lucas Ocampos calmly put the ball past Manuel Neuer with a cheeky no-look shot. 

Leon Goretzka got the equaliser before half-time with a lovely move, and Robert Lewandowski thought he had another goal, but it was disallowed for offside.
