Baby sleeping bags sold on online marketplaces and well-known High Street stores have been found to fail safety tests and could prove fatal to a child, a new consumer watchdog investigation warns today.

The urgent warning to Britain's parents comes from the latest research by Which? that shows that the baby sleeping bags pose serious safety risks that could cause a child to choke, suffocate or overheat.

The consumer champion found that 12 out of 15 baby sleeping bags bought from online marketplaces, as well as high street stores and online from leading brands, failed its safety tests. 

Of 15 baby sleeping bags tested by Which? only these three products passed all of their tests.

The bags were chosen to be tested if they came up as the first relevant product when searching online and had to be described and fit the look of a traditional baby sleeping bag.

All nine sleeping bags from online marketplaces AliExpress, Amazon Marketplace, eBay, Etsy and Wish failed at least one of Which?'s tests, with some posing major safety risks to babies' lives, raising serious questions about the limited responsibilities of platforms for ensuring products sold on their sites are safe.

Sleeping bags bought from JoJo Maman Bébé, Aldi and Grobag also failed Which?'s safety testing by either posing a safety risk or failing to adhere to British standards.

The report said that baby sleeping bags can be a safer alternative to traditional cot blankets as they prevent babies' faces from accidentally getting covered during the night, which can lead to suffocation. 

Yet Which? found sleeping bags sold by third-party sellers on online marketplaces and even some popular retailers could be putting infants' lives at risk.

Which? found that the JoJo Maman Bebe bag (left) was 1.6cm too large for children aged six to 18 months. A bag from AliExpress (right) also had a neck size that was too large and could have allowed a child to slip into the bag and suffocate

Which? runs rigorous lab tests to ensure baby sleeping bags are safe to use. This includes checking the neck opening is the right size, ensuring fasteners and buttons are secure and that the sleeping bag is free from loose threads and strangulation hazards.

Each bag is also checked to ensure it states accurate tog levels - so babies do not overheat - and includes all key safety instructions. If a product does not pass all tests, it is deemed unsafe.

Which? found that seven of the 12 sleeping bags that failed were deemed to be serious failures, meaning that they could cause a baby harm or endanger its life.

Raising the most concerns, Which? found that three sleeping bags, including one purchased from AliExpress, one from Wish and one from boutique retailer Jojo Maman Bébé, had wide-neck openings that were too big for the age they were advertised for.

Neck openings that are too wide could lead to a baby slipping down into the bag and suffocating.

The baby sleeping bag/cocoon stroller (left) from AliExpress was found to have openings that a child could get their finger's stuck in and a button that was too easily removed from the inside. Another bag, sold on eBay (right) was found to have loose threads that were too long

Another sleeping bag purchased from AliExpress presented a choking risk to babies, as Which? testing found the button inside the hood could be easily pulled off. This bag also did not come with any safety instructions.

A fox-themed baby sleeping bag sold on Wish.com raised concerns as the tog level exceeded the upper recommended level by 26 per cent, which could cause overheating. Again, there were no safety instructions with the bag.

A sleeping bag purchased from Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods, failed testing as it did not mention the height and age the bag is designed for. 

It is important that baby products are used for the right age group, especially sleeping bags as a product could endanger an infant if it is too big.

One sleeping bag sold on eBay failed testing due to long, loose and free-hanging labels or threads that could catch on the fingers of small babies as they move around or lead to strangulation. It also had no safety instructions or warnings.

A further five baby sleeping bags had less serious safety concerns but failed to meet British safety standards.

Both 'Amazon's Choice' baby sleeping bags and a separate one from eBay failed to meet official standards due to labeling issues, either because they were longer than standards specify, the label was in the wrong position or because they did not include important safety warnings.

Aldi's Cloud Baby Sleep Bag and Tommee Tippee's The Original GroBag also had less serious safety concerns, but both fell short of British standards due to loose hanging labels.

Only three sleeping bags - from Asda, John Lewis and Mamas & Papas - passed all of Which?'s safety tests and met British safety standards.

Despite the huge growth in online shopping in recent years, online marketplaces have very limited responsibility for ensuring products sold on their sites are safe. 

The Sweet Dreams Little Star Wearable Infant Blanket from Etsy (left) did not have any instructions and the height and age rating were not mentioned. A sleeping bag sold by Good Things (right) was found to have a zip that was too easy to open and the bag was too hot

Alarmingly, every baby sleeping bag Which? purchased from an online marketplace failed safety tests.

Following Which?'s investigation, Amazon, AliExpress and eBay have removed all of the baby sleeping bags that failed its tests from their sites.

While it is important that online marketplaces do more to prevent the sale of unsafe products from their platforms, Which? is now calling on the government to make online marketplaces legally responsible for the safety of products sold on their site, so consumers can shop with confidence.

Natalie Hitchins, Which? Head of Home Products and Services, said: 'Parents will find it completely unacceptable that Which?'s investigation has found such a high number of dangerous products that could pose a potentially life-threatening risk to their baby as it sleeps.

'Consumers must be able to trust that if they buy a product in the UK from a well-known retailer or online marketplace that it will be safe and meet the safety standards required in this country.

'The government must step in to make online marketplaces legally responsible for the safety of the products sold on their sites. We also expect retailers to remove any unsafe products from sale.'

Which? Found multiple problems with a sleeping bag sold by San Daohui (left) which was missing important safety warnings, had loose-hanging threads and the label was too long. The Aldi cloud baby sleep bag (right) had a zip that was too easy to open

Which? offered each of the online marketplaces the opportunity to comment on its findings on the dangerous baby sleeping bags being sold through their sites.

AliExpress said: 'We consider the safety of all products on our marketplace, especially children's products, to be of paramount importance. 

'After we were made aware of these unsafe items, we took prompt action and removed them. We have policies in place to help identify listings which may infringe our policies and when informed of non-compliant listings, we take swift action.'

Amazon said that safety is important, it uses proactive measures to stop suspicious or non-compliant products being listed and it monitors products and stores for safety concerns. 

It will also remove products from stores and reach out to sellers, manufacturers, government agencies and others for additional information. 

Customers with concerns about products are encouraged to contact customer services so that Amazon can investigate.

The Snooze bag 2.5 Tog (left), sold through eBay, had issues including: the label being too large, instructions missing information about fastening necks and arms and it failed to warn parents against using if their babies can climb out of their cot. The Lictin Baby Sleeping Bag (right), sold through the Amazon Marketplace, was missing five key safety warnings and an issue with a loop label

An eBay spokesperson said: 'We work closely with regulators, authorities and consumer organisations including Trading Standards and the OPSS, and go beyond the legal requirements for product safety. 

'The three listings tested and flagged to us have been removed and action has been taken against the sellers. We have also requested that the sellers issue a recall notice.'

Which? offered Etsy the opportunity to comment on the findings but at the time of writing, it hadn't responded to the offer.

Wish told Which? that it will be alerting the merchants in question who sell the baby sleeping bags featured in this article.

JoJo Maman Bébé said that the bag tested was manufactured under the previous standard BS 8510:2009 and should fully comply to this standard and be labelled as such. The failures are all new recommendations from the revised standard. 

The Silvercloud Counting Sheep Sleeping Bag (left), sold through Amazon marketplace, had a label that was marginally too long. The Original Grobag (right) passed nearly all tests but had a label that was marginally too long for safety standards

The bag was purchased at a time when their stock was transitioning from one standard to another, which took slightly longer than anticipated.

Aldi said: 'This product has been extensively tested, complies with the relevant safety standards and is entirely safe to use. We've sold thousands of them and haven't had any complaints related to the points raised by Which?.'

Babycurls said that the sleeping bag tested by Which? was independently tested in 2017 to the earlier BS 8510:2009 and it passed the tests. The sample tested by Which? was manufactured in early 2018 and before the new testing standard was introduced. 

They went on to say: 'Going forward our bags will conform to BS EN 16781:2018, the label will be shortened and packaging will include the required instructions.'

Mayborn Group, makers of the Original Grobag told Which?: 'Following an investigation the label has been found to exceed the requirement of the standard by 3mm. 

'The label in question is positioned inside the product, in a location that's inaccessible to a child and it's too wide and short to pose a problem. We are confident that there is no safety risk.'

None of the other sellers featured had responded at the time of writing.
