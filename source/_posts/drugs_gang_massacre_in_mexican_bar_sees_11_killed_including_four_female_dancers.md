Gunmen massacred 11 people including four dancers and then left their bullet ridden bodies in a bar in Mexico's most violent state.

The assassins struck early on Sunday in a bar near to the town of Jaral del Progreso, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato.

Local media claims that the four women found dead were local dancers at the bar which is located on the side of a highway.

No motive has been put forward for the shooting but the bar is in an area is near to the bordering state of Michoacán.

The town of Jaral del Progreso is an incursion point into Guanajuato for the Jalisco cartel who wants to expand to there.

The attack bore the signs of a drugs killing and Guanajuato has been the most violent Mexican state in recent years.

Guanajuato, a major carmaking hub, has become a recurring scene of criminal violence in Mexico, ravaged by a turf war between the local Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

In July, gunmen killed 24 people at a drug rehabilitation center in Guanajuato, marking one of the worst mass slayings since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office pledging to reduce record levels of violence.

It was hoped that the arrest and detention of José Antonio Yépez Ortíz, the leader of the local Santa Rosa de Lima gang, on August 2 would help to stem the violence.

The drug kingpin, better known by his nickname El Marro (The Sledgehammer), had fought a long and bloody turf war against the Jalisco cartel.

The authorities blamed Ortiz for much of the violence which had taken place in the industrial and farming state.

This is the latest atrocity in Mexico this year which is gearing up to be the most violent and bloodiest year in the country on record.

There was an astonishing 117 murders recorded in just 24-hours on June 7 making it the most deadly day of the year so far.

It was run close by April 20 which had the previous high figure of 114 homicides. 

Murders across the state of Guanajuato dropped slightly to 339 in August from 403 the month before.

There are fears that the figure will rise steeply through September as rival gang members seek to fill the vacuum left by Ortiz's jail sentence.
