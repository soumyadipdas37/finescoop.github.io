Julianne Hough has been keeping busy as Hollywood resumes business and she gets to work on her fitness brand.

But the celebrity dancer will always have time for family, especially if it means a girls' day with her favorite girl.

She teased some leg Monday in a chic long-sleeve jade green midi dress with a thigh-high leg slit, as she stepped out for lunch with mom Marriann in Los Angeles.

The 32-year-old complemented the look with some strappy white leather sandals, which brought out the white polka print of the dress.

She finished the ensemble with a disposable face mask, while carrying a tan leather tote bag over her shoulder.

Julianne previously took to her Instagram Story with a glimpse at her morning routine, which included lemon water, 'morning pages,' breathwork, meditation and workout.

She shared her 'September Morning Pages Challenge' with her 4.9million Instagram followers earlier this week, challenging them to write down whatever's on their mind as soon as they wake up.

The Burlesque actress posted to her Story later on Monday, as she got to work in the studio with her Kinrgy crew.

She said in a behind-the-scenes video: 'We are here. We've got one more class that I'm teaching this week. And then we'll be back on Tuesday.' 

Julianne also posted a video to her profile, as she lied down on a heating pad, while her crew piled on top of her.

She wrote: 'When @biomatprofessionals so good all the @kinrgy guides want in! We’ve been hard at work in the studio this week recording some new and exciting stuff for you guys, and the BioMat has been saving our booties (literally) with it’s muscle relaxing technology and Far Infrared Ray heat.

'(All Covid-19 guidelines and protocols are being followed in our studio. Team members have their temperatures checked upon arrival and personnel behind the camera are required to wear masks)'

The Dancing with the Stars alum launched her holistic movement experience earlier this year, and has been offering virtual classes amid COVID-19.

She told Us Weekly in May: 'With so much uncertainty in the world today, it’s easy to feel a bit lost and isolated.

'Now more than ever, people are searching for deeper human connections, and at its core the Kinrgy philosophy guides us to our inner knowing, that it all starts from within.'

Julianne has recently sparked rumors of reconciliation with estranged husband Brooks Laich, 37, whom she married back in July of 2017.

She and the former NHL pro have been spending some time together since confirming their split back in May, and she's even been spotted wearing her wedding ring again. 

A source recently told People: 'Brooks really still wants to make it work and she's considering it but taking her time. He's open to whatever it will take.'

The insider added: 'Julianne likes the idea of freedom but doesn't want to lose such a good, solid guy. Everyone who knows him knows how grounded and great he is. Her friends and family don't want her to lose someone like that.'
