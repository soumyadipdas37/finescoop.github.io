Kim Kardashian West and husband Kanye West are continuing to work on their marriage despite his unlikely bid for presidency causing friction, according to a new report.

The famous couple have weathered quite the storm over the past few months, stemming from his erratic behavior following his chaotic presidential rally debut in South Carolina, in July. 

It was recently reported that Kanye, 43, has spent nearly $6 million of his own money on his presidential campaign since launching it only two months ago.

However, Kim, 39, and Kanye are said to be now 'doing well' following all the drama, and that the rapper has found himself to be in a 'better mental state.'

'Kim and Kanye are doing well. Kanye is in a better mental state. Their marriage still needs work, but Kim is getting across to him. He is not shutting her out and wants to be with his family,' an insider claims to PEOPLE Magazine.  

The source adds: 'Kim continues to be incredibly patient and understanding about Kanye's desire to run for president.'

'She just wants to get through the next few months peacefully. She is kind of standing back while Kanye does whatever makes him happy.'

DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for the reality star for comment.  

There had been recent rumors of unrest between the pair due to the fact Kanye appears to be based in Wyoming, while Kim remains in Los Angeles - however, the couple do seem to be making the effort to spend time with each other at weekends.

The family returned to Los Angeles last month after a Caribbean trip that was reportedly booked to save their marriage amid his alleged bipolar struggle.

Meanwhile a PEOPLE insider previously claimed Kanye had been self-isolating at his Wyoming property away from his wife and children before the Caribbean trip and 'wants to live' there. 

However a DailyMail.com source clarified that Kanye, who is running for President Of The United States this year, was 'never living apart' from Kim. 

The bulk of the money West's campaign has spent has been on consultants and legal fees while trying to get onto state ballots

This insider explained: 'He does a lot of work in Wyoming and she works in LA. They're focused on their family now and rarely talk politics.'

'They had a good family week in the Dominican Republic,' an insider dished to People after the family returned to America.

'Kim and Kanye are getting along. They both seem much happier,' continued the insider on August 9, the day the family arrived in Miami.

A source shed light on Kim's state of mind: 'Between the kids, work, and dealing with Kanye's bipolar episodes, it's been hard for her to think clearly.' 

Kanye praised Kim's mother Kris Jenner on Twitter after his return to America, just weeks after denouncing her on Twitter as 'Kris Jong-Un.'

'My mother in law Kris Jenner ... makes the best music playlist,' wrote Kanye, who slammed her multiple times on Twitter last month. 

During the Caribbean trip a The Sun insider said Kim 'offered to fully support a 2024 run for president if he got help and listened to the political consultants they hired.'

However the source also claimed that he refuses to budge from the idea of running this year, saying: 'Kanye seems set on what he calls "God's plan" - that he becomes president. He's saying it's a higher calling.'
