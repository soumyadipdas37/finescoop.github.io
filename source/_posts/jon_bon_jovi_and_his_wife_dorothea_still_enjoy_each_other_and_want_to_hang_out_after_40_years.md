'Having grown up together and grown together. And we really like each other. We want to hang out,' the Bon Jovi frontman said in the new issue of People, on newsstands Friday.

'I was immediately drawn to her from the minute I saw her - and that's never changed - 40 years ago.'

The married couple - both 58 - originally met in 1980 while attending Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey where 'she let me cheat off her in history!'

'I always said I was good at spotting potential too. I have a gift,' his 'rock' Dorothea gushed.

'He's cute. I'm shallow. I'll admit it!'

Jon added: 'We enjoy each other and we never fell for the trappings of what celebrity can do. We've witnessed that happen over the years to people that were close to us and people that we knew from afar.'

The former high school sweethearts have run the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation since 2006, which aims to end hunger and homelessness through their pay-what-you-can Soul Kitchen restaurants and food bank.

'If we could put a roof over someone's head or put food in their belly [then] it's quite simple: We don't need a scientist to find the cure [for COVID-19],' Bon Jovi (born John Bongiovi) explained.

Dorothea continued: 'It's a partnership. When we see injustice or people suffering, you want to help. We're very blessed, and we have the ability to do that.'

The inseparable pair have raised four children together - daughter Stephanie, 27; and sons Jesse, 25; Jacob, 18; and Romeo, 16.
