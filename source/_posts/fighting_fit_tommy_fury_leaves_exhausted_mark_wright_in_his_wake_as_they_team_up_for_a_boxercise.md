Tommy Fury demonstrated his match fitness as he became the latest guest on one of Mark Wright's Instagram Live exercise sessions on Sunday morning.

The Love Island 2019 runner up, 21, joined Mark, 33, for an hour-long boxercise HIIT session, in which the two reality stars demonstrated boxing moves and exercises to thousands of their fans.

While professional boxer Tommy barely seemed to break a sweat, Mark quickly appeared out of breath.

At the halfway point, the TOWIE star confided: 'I don't know if I can get through another half,' to which Tommy obliviously replied that he felt like he was 'glowing'.

Tommy gave numerous exercise tips to his fans, demonstrating how best to carry out an array of jabs and undercuts, press ups and squats. 

The two reality hunks appeared on separate screens due to logistical reasons – despite the fact that both were in fact exercising at other ends of the same field.

Amusingly at one point, Mark called across the field for Tommy to wave, and the myth of their separation was broken as it became clear they were just a few hundred metres away. 

Despite Mark's visible tiredness, both he and Tommy appeared in good shape.

They each sported tight-fitting grey exercise gear that emphasised their enviable physiques. 

When asked as to when he might next be in a boxing bout, Tommy said: 'I'm feeling in magnificent shape – and hopefully will have some fight news for you all soon.'  

Different abilities: While Tommy barely seemed to break a sweat, Mark appeared exhausted 

He later added: 'I'm dedicating everything - I'm 21 years old, I'm living in camp, there's no partying, there's no drinking - I want to be a champ.'

For now though, he seemed pleased to help Mark out with his exercise business wrightfit.

He said: 'It's a pleasure being out today in the sun, motivating people, that's what it's all about.'
