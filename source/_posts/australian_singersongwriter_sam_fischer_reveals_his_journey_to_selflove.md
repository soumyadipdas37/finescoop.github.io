He's had a life-changing 12 months after his single The City went viral and took the world by storm. 

But even with all his success, it's taken a while for Australian singer-songwriter Sam Fischer to discover his own self-worth - and now he's chosen to detail it in a brand new song. 

'[My new song] Ready is a message to myself to say... no one's going to love me the way I can love me, if I let myself,' the 29-year-old told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It took a long time to get to where I am!' Australian singer-songwriter Sam Fischer (pictured) has revealed his journey to self-love after taking the world by storm with his hit single The City 

'It’s not been the easiest couple of years... it took a long time to get to where I am now mentally and emotionally,' he added.

The Sydney-born songwriter turned into an overnight success after his song This City went viral on TikTok, earning over one billion views. 

In May, James told talk show host James Corden that his album was 'ready' and he had been waiting for the right time to drop it.  

'[My new song] Ready is a message to myself to say... no one's going to love me the way I can love me, if I let myself,' the 29-year-old told Daily Mail Australia

Sam kick-started his career writing songs for global superstars including Jessie J, Demi Lovato, Keith Urban and Louis Tomlinson. 

Back in April, he made headlines around the world when he made his US television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live from his bathroom.

'Never in a million years did I think I'd be shooting my TV US debut in my apartment, on my iPhone and totally raw,' Sam told Daily Mail Australia at the time.

'In the end it's made this experience one I'll never forget and a story I'll tell for years to come.'  

Sam currently lives in Los Angeles. 

His new EP Homework is now available for streaming.
