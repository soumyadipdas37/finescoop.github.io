After more than 10 years on the air, AMC's hugely popular show The Walking Dead will end after season 11, it has been confirmed. 

The cable network revealed the news on Wednesday revealing that the final season will feature 24 episodes, stretched out over two years, whereas previous seasons have only had 16 episodes.

The zombie-heavy series - from creator Robert Kirkman - will continue airing through to late 2020, with the show getting a fittingly slow and painful death.

However, it's not entirely the end of the road - as AMC has said it still plans to expand the Walking Dead universe, with a number of spin-offs, including a straight-to-series order for a drama that will follow Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Carol (Melissa McBride). 

The third spin-off from the show is yet to be given a title, but is expected to launch in 2023, once The Walking Dead is over.
