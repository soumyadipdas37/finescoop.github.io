Piers Morgan engaged in some hilarious banter with Vinnie Jones on Monday ahead of filming Life Stories. 

The former footballer, 55, and GMB star, 55, are filming a 60-minute special of his hit ITV series, which will air on Saturday. 

And ahead of the interview, Piers jokingly warned Vinnie that he will 'crunch his n**s' during the episode.

Taking to Instagram, the TV star and journalist posted a hilarious video of the duo engaging in a banter match while Lisa Armstrong applied their make-up backstage. 

Filming Vinnie as he got ready for filming, the former footballer said: 'Here we are in the make-up room, Piers has been here three hours before me. I'm two minutes, aren't I darlin'?

'What time are the scaffolders coming in, to take down the scaffolding off his chubby cheeks.'

To which Piers warned: 'You wait mate, when you're in the chair, you're mine. All mine.'

Exciting! The former footballer, 55, and GMB star, 55, are filming a 60-minute special of his hit ITV series, which will air on Saturday

He then made reference of the infamous clash between Wimbledon and Newcastle United on February 6, 1988, where Vinnie decided to grab Paul Gascoigne by his crotch.

Piers joked: 'I'm going to make what you did to Gazza look like a tea party!' 

To which Vinnie revealed he was going to be sitting in the audience and he was the one person allowed to watch filming during the Covid-19 crisis.

With Piers quipping: 'He can enjoy your n**s being crunched!'

Banter: Filming Vinnie as he got ready for filming, the former footballer said: 'Here we are in the make-up room, Piers has been here three hours before me. I'm two minutes, aren't I darlin'?

Undeterred by the warning, Vinnie replied: 'We will see about that, son, you had your chance last time!'   

On the episode of Life Stories, the sporting star will discuss how his life has changed irrevocably after losing his wife of 25 years, Tanya, to cancer in July 2019 after a six-year battle. 

Vinnie previously appeared on the ITV series in 2009 where Tanya tragically sat in the audience and supported him.

In July, Vinnie revealed that he 'still cries every day' one year after losing his wife, as he said he lives his life with her 'guiding hand on his shoulder'. 

In 2013 the hardman revealed that he and Tanya had both been diagnosed with melanoma - the most serious form of skin cancer.

The couple both initially beat it but Tanya's cancer later returned and she passed away at the couple's Los Angeles home last year aged 53.

Tanya had a daughter, Kaley, 33, from her first marriage, and Vinnie had a son, Aaron, 29, from his former relationship with Mylene Elliston.

As well as Vinnie, Piers will also be interviewing hero Captain Sir Thomas Moore on Life Stories.

Talking about the upcoming episodes, the TV star said: 'I am absolutely thrilled to be interviewing two such great British characters. 

'I’ve known Vinnie for over 30 years and Captain Tom for just a few months, but I’m a huge admirer of the way both men have handled the highs and lows of their lives and these promise to be very emotional and inspiring shows.'
