A heartbroken Tammin Sursok is grieving the loss of her beloved family dog, Sydney.

The Australian actress made the tough decision to put the aging pooch to sleep on Saturday in Los Angeles.

'She was 14 years old and had heart failure. She was in pain and watching her struggle broke me,' Tammin said.

Sharing an emotional photo with her followers on Instagram, the 37-year-old reflected on her time spent with the canine over the years. 

Tammin, who rose to fame on Home And Away in the early 2000s, admitted she would never usually share a photo crying, but was compelled to be vulnerable with her online community.

'It’s funny that when your heart is broken you cry so many tears you think there aren’t any left. And yet they still come,' she said.

'We have time. But not forever. It’s not forever. So this is my message to you. Reach out to people, make time, hug your animals and your loved ones, hold them closer. Look up. Connect,' Tammin urged her fans.    

'For we don’t know how many days we have left. So make sure your days are filled with what gives you meaning.'

'Rest well my angel. I will always love you. 13 years together. My first born. Hug the ones you love tightly tonight. It’s all so fleeting,' she wrote at the time.

The actress married film producer Sean McEwen in 2011, and the couple share two daughters: six-year-old Phoenix, and eight-month-old Lennon.
