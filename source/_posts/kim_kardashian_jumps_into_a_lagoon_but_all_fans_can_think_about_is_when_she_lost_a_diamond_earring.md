Even nine years later, fans have not forgotten Kim Kardashian's emotional reaction to losing one of her prized $75,000 diamond earrings in the waters of Bora Bora.

And on Sunday morning, a sea of her 189 million Instagram followers were reminded of the fan-favorite KUWTK scene after the reality star shared a video of herself jumping into a 'blue lagoon' with her children.   

Despite dozens of cheeky reminders to 'hold on' to her earrings, jewelry appeared to be the last thing on the 39-year-old reality star's mind. 

Unforgettable: A number of Kim Kardashian's vocal Instagram followers compared her latest video jumping into a 'blue lagoon' to a fan-favorite scene, by Keeping Up with the Kardashians cameras in 2011

Before splashing around with her and Kanye West's eldest children, the KKW beauty mogul eagerly jumped into the glistening blue waters in a bikini and sneakers. 

After showing off her famous curves, the mother-of-four could be seen encouraging her daughter North, seven, and Saint, four, to join her. 

While the star's mini-me eagerly dove in, Kardashian's little boy took a few extra moments before diving in.

Poking fun: The memorable KUWTK scene, which took place while she was still married to her ex Kris Humphries, continues to give fans flashbacks and amusement

Humorous: Despite dozens of cheeky reminders to 'hold on' to her earrings, jewelry appeared to be the last thing on the 39-year-old reality star's mind

As she enjoyed a family-filled excursion, the beauty appeared to have learned her lesson about wearing expensive gems by the sea. 

Yet the memorable Keeping Up With The Kardashians scene, which took place in 2011 when she was still married to Kris Humphries, continues to give fans flashbacks and amusement.

During the episode, as Kim screamed about her lost treasure, Kourtney dropped one of the most iconic lines from the show: 'Kim, there's people that are dying.' 

A lot has changed in nine years:  Over the years, Kardashian stopped wearing  jewelry in her house or appearances, after she at gunpoint by five burglars in Paris, France

In a 2017 interview with Buzzfeed, Kylie Jenner revealed how she ended up saving the day for her sister. 

'It was pretty deep, but there [weren't] a lot of waves and Kim kind of, like, threw a tantrum immediately when she found out that she lost it and I was like, "No. This is fine!"' Kylie said.

'I went under there and it was saltwater so it kind of hurt to open my eyes, but I just opened my eyes and looked around and I saw something shining.

Having fun: While the star's mini-me eagerly dove in, Kardashian's little boy took a few extra moments before diving in

'Swam all the way down there — it was, like, 10 feet — picked it up, and it was the shining diamond! I literally found it in two minutes.'

However, even after retrieving the precious goods, Kim still wasn't entirely satisfied.

'Then [Kim] was like, "You know, I don't have my backing but it's fine. I can always get that." And I was like, I'm just gonna look! So I went back down and I found the backing. I found the earring backing!'
