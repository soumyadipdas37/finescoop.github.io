Traces of Covid-19 have been detected in sewage in two of Sydney's most popular beachside suburbs.

The virus was detected in wastewater at Bondi and Malabar in the city's south-east for two consecutive weeks earlier this month on September 6 and 13. 

The positive samples were detected despite no cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source or any new clusters reported across the state in the past seven days.

'These samples were taken from Bondi and Malabar and are expected given the presence of known COVID-19 cases in the sewerage catchment areas,' the latest NSW Health surveillance report  released on Thursday said.

The samples were taken from an area serving a population of more than two million Sydneysiders, including the CBD and quarantine hotels.  

 A person with COVID-19 can shed the virus in their body waste even if they no longer test positive or have any symptoms.

The NSW Sewage Surveillance Program has tested untreated sewerage at 42 sites across the state since July to track infection rates and provide health authorities early warning of a possible spike in infections.

'To date, the sewage surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is in the preliminary stages, and further analysis is required to assess the significance of the results,' the report states.

Virus fragments have also been detected in previous samples across the state including metropolitan Sydney, Perisher in the Snowy Mountains, Newcastle, Byron Bay on the far north coast and the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.

All positive samples except Perisher were in areas with known COVID-19 infections.

NSW recorded just one new case on Thursday, which was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine.

The state's death toll remains at 55. 

Health authorities urge residents to tested and isolate as soon as symptoms develop, even if they are mild.
