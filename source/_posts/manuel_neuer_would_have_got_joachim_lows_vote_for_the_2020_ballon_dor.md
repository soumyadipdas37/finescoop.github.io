Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer would have got Germany manager Joachim Low's vote for the 2020 Ballon d'Or over Robert Lewandowski.

Striker Lewandowski enjoyed a sensational 2019-20 season, scoring 55 goals in 47 matches and was tipped to be in with a huge chance of winning France Football's prestigious prize before it was cancelled.

However Germany boss Low believes that Bayern No 1 Neuer has been the standout performer this year.

'Manu was in great shape throughout the 2019-20 season,' he told Kicker. 'Manu is in a class of his own. Crazy, unbelievable.

'I have nothing against Robert Lewandowski, he is a world-class goalscorer, but for me, the best player in the world this year would be Manuel Neuer. What he did in the Final 8 in Lisbon! He kept the shop shut!

'Manuel was on hand in difficult situations against Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain, otherwise it might be 0-1 or 1-1. You had the feeling that he was omnipresent.' 

Neuer kept 22 clean sheets in 51 appearances for Bayern last campaign and played a crucial role in their path to Champions League glory in Portugal.

However the Ballon d'Or will not be awarded this year for the first time since it was launched in 1956 due to the 2019-20 season being disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
