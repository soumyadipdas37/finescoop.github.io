An artisan baker has shared a mesmerising video showing exactly how he creates the unique patterns on top of bread loaves.

Clifford Luu, from Sydney, used a sewing thread and a small razor blade to score intricate patterns on the raw sourdough.

'Behind the scenes of scoring bread! Using the sewing thread to make out the lines and guides to create geometry using diamond shaped,' Cliff wrote on his Instagram.

The baker simply used a string to press a straight line all around the dough before using the razor blade to cut deep patterns to create a floral shape.

Scoring the dough with a blade or a sharp knife allows the bread to expand during baking. While the patterns help control the direction in which the bread expands in the oven.

More than 2,000 people have 'liked' the post, with many describing the technique as 'beautiful', 'stunning' and 'satisfying to watch'.  

Home cooks around the country have been cooking at home more than ever before, with many creating their own sourdough bread from scratch.

Lifestyle blogger Connie Cao, from Melbourne, has shared some of her beginner's tips after baking her own loaves of sourdough bread every week.

After lots of trial and error, Connie said she discovered the best tool to score the dough to perfection.

'I used to use a knife but it was way too blunt. Then I discovered the razor blade and oh my goodness. What a game changer,' she wrote on her blog.

'Score the dough (make a cut down the middle, or whatever shapes you prefer).'
