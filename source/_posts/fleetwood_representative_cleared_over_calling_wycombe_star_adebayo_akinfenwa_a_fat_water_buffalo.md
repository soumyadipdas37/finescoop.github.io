A member of staff at Fleetwood Town has been cleared of any wrongdoing by calling Adebayo Akinfenwa a 'fat water buffalo' - after the FA's investigation found the term was not 'objectively racist'.

The Wycombe striker was incensed after being 'repeatedly' called a fat water buffalo at last season's League One play-off semi-final between the two sides, saying he felt 'dehumanised' by what he felt was a racist term.

The FA are satisfied the term was used - but employed a race relations expert who ruled it was not objectively racist and therefore there was insufficent evidence to indicate a rules breach.

The words were used against Adebayo Akinfenwa in the League One play-off semi-final

It is unknown whether the term was used by a player, substitute or member of staff from Fleetwood. 

The FA's statement read: 'The FA interviewed a number of witnesses, including players and staff from WWFC and FTFC, as well as two match officials.

'The witness accounts all confirmed the use of the term 'water buffalo' or 'buffalo'. However, some witnesses did not consider the term to be discriminatory and did not consider it to have been used in a discriminatory manner. 

'Others were unsure whether the term was discriminatory. Some witnesses stated they did consider the term to be discriminatory.

'The FA also commissioned a report from an independent expert in race relations to provide an expert opinion on the words. The expert was provided with all the details of the allegation, as well as the context in which the words were used, and concluded that the words were not objectively racist.' 

The FA found that the words against Akinfenwa had been used but were not 'objectively racist'

After the play-off semi final, Akinfenwa took to Twitter to reveal his experiences of suffering racial abuse, highlighting how much more needs to be done to eradicate it from society.

He said: 'Monday night was one of the highlights of my career with Wycombe so far as we secured our place in the League One Play-Off Final at Wembley.

'However, what should have been an evening of joy and excitement quickly turned into one of anger and frustration

'Following the conclusion of the game I learned that a representative of the opposition had repeatedly referred to me as a Fat 'Water Buffalo' in a derogatory tone.

'Regardless of whether or not there was deliberate racial intent by using that language, and irrespective of the context in which it was used, if we are to make real and long standing change then we must strive to educate each other about these issues.' 

In its ruling, the FA was at pains to point out that allegations of racial abuse are taken seriously and encouraged people to report similar incidents moving forwards.
