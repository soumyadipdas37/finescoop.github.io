An estate agent who was caught driving at twice the drink-drive limit after she turned to alcohol while on furlough has been banned from driving for nearly two years. 

Amy Humphreys, 27, from Bury, pleaded guilty to one count of drink driving after admitting to police she drank two glasses of red wine before getting behind the wheel. 

She was driving her white Range Rover Evoque in Bury around 10.50pm on June 19 when patrolling officers allegedly saw her skip a red light, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard.

Humphreys turned right and pulled over where she admitted to drinking two glasses of red wine, Manchester Evening News reported. 

Amy Humphreys (pictured), 27, from Bury, was driving her white Range Rover Evoque around 10.50pm on June 19

She was taken to a police station after giving a positive reading for alcohol in a roadside breath test.  

She gave a reading of 98mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath, while the legal limit is 35mg. 

Mitigating, Paul Shepherd said that it was out of character for Humphreys. He said: 'On the day in question, it was during lockdown and she noticed she had been drinking at home, which was something she had not usually done. 

'She had struggled with the environment and being furloughed and being off work.' 

He added that, after receiving a call from her father who had fallen, Humphreys had panicked and driven to see him. 

Mr Shepherd said that Humphreys was going through a difficult time, with her mother undergoing cancer treatment. 

Mitigating, Paul Shepherd said it was out of character for Humphreys (pictured) and that she 'had struggled with the environment and being furloughed' 

He said Humphreys has since sought help from her GP and was 'very ashamed and embarrassed' by her behaviour.  

Zak Azim, prosecuting, said officers were driving along Bolton Road in Bury when they spotted her driving 50 metres in front of them. 

He said that, when officers went to speak to her, they believed she was under the influence and could smell intoxicants on her breath.   

Humphreys was said to have no previous convictions. She was not charged with going through the red light. 

She was fined £615, ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £61 victim surcharge and was disqualified from driving for 23 months. 

She must take an extended retest before getting behind the wheel again.  

It was said that not being able to drive will make part of her job more difficult when she goes to value houses and help clients.  

Sentencing her, magistrates said: 'This is a very serious offence and you know that. 

'We don't think a community order will be workable due to your personal circumstances and employment status.'
