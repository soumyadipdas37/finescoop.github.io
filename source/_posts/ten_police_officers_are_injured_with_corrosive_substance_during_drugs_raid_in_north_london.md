At least 10 officers have been injured by a suspected corrosive substance during a drugs raid in north London. 

Officers attended an industrial area in Barnet to execute a drugs warrant at around 2pm today when several were 'injured by a suspected corrosive substance,' the Metropolitan Police said.

Witnesses reported hearing a 'loud bang' before 'hundreds' of officers flooded the area, alongside scores of paramedics and fire crews.

One woman in the area reported seeing 'police officers being showered down' by firemen following the incident.

She told MailOnline: 'I just heard a bang and then saw hundreds of emergency services. 

'The fireman then told us we had to get away and we saw police officers being showered down.'

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: 'A number of officers have been injured following a police operation in Barnet.
