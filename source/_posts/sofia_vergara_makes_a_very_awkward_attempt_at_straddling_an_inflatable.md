The controversy surrounding a trespasser's recent attempt to enter Sofia Vergara's family home was brushed aside on Thursday as the actress took to Instagram.  

Apparently keen to focus on happier times, Sofia shared a throwback video that was filmed as she relaxed in her outdoor pool over the summer. 

The Modern Family star, 48, was shot wearing a white swimsuit as she made a rather ungraceful attempt at straddling a large inflatable. 

Happier times: The controversy surrounding a trespasser's recent attempt to enter Sofia Vergara's family home was brushed aside on Thursday as the actress took to Instagram 

After attempting to climb onto the bull shaped pool accessory, Sofia promptly lost her balance and slipped headfirst  into the water. 

Determined to master the inflatable, she made another equally unsuccessful attempt that resulted in her floundering beneath the bull and its circular surrounding, before finally admitting defeat. 

The post comes after Sofia and husband Joe Manganiello's gated community was infiltrated by a stranger claiming to know her son Manolo, TMZ reports.

The couple reportedly fell victim when the suspect broke into their gated community but was infiltrated by security.

When security in the exclusive area suspected the trespasser, he reportedly claimed he knew Sofia's son, 28, leading to suspicions and an eventual police call.

Law insiders told the site that Sofia and Joe were faced with the drama when the man made his way into the community at noon last week.

Good sport: Fortunately the actress was able to see the funny side, despite getting a soaking 

When he was approached by security, who were suspicious of his behaviour, he is said to have told his story about Monolo.

Security called for support from the police and after he refuses to leave quietly, he was arrested and charged with trespassing. 

News of the break in comes after the Colombian-born actress joined America's Got Talent as a new judge following the conclusion of her hugely successful ABC sitcom Modern Family after 11 seasons.

It was her first high profile gig after Modern Family and she joined Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel and returning judge Heidi Klum on the panel.

Meanwhile, the couple will celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary later this year.
