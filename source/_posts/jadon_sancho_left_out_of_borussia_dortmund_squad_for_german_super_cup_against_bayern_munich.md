Borussia Dortmund have confirmed star Jadon Sancho has been left out of their German Super Cup against Bayern Munich with a 'respitatory infection'. 

The England winger has been Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No 1 target for months but Manchester United have been unwilling to match the Bundesliga side's £108million valuation.

But ahead of the transfer window closing on Monday, Dortmund have now confirmed Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Burki will not fly to south Germany to take on their arch rivals due to respiratory infections.

The club however confirmed both players had tested negative for coronavirus.
