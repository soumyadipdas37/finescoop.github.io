A teenager who was banned from seeing her ex-boyfriend was dragged out of his bed by his horrified mother in the middle of the night.  

Lily Moody, 18, from south Sydney, was under a court-sanctioned apprehended violence order that prevented her from seeing or contacting her ex-boyfriend.

Moody was busted by her ex-boyfriend's mum when the pair were in bed together at his Caringbah home, just weeks after the order was finalised, on September 20.  

The mum asked Moody to leave before being forced to drag the 18-year-old out by her hair at 4.30am, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Moody's AVO also prevented her from going within within 100m of her ex-boyfriend's home or workplace. 

Agreed police facts said the ex-boyfriend's mum messaged her son about hearing Moody's voice inside the house before confronting the pair. 

'The victim's mother heard Moody's voice and, knowing there was an AVO restricting her from the address, messaged her son asking him to make Moody leave.

'She then came downstairs and went into the bedroom to find Moody and her son in bed together,' agreed police facts stated.  

Police alleged the 18-year-old repeatedly ignored requests for her to leave and instead stood on the bed and yelled at her ex-boyfriend's mother.

Moody continued to demand an Uber and her ex-boyfriend's mum resorted to physically removing the teenager from the room.  

'His mother had to resort to reasonable physical force to try and get Moody to leave and grabbed her by the hair as an attempt to get her out of the bed and out of the bedroom,' agreed police facts said.

Moody and her ex-boyfriend then walked out of the house and caught an Uber to an unknown location together. 

She fronted Sutherland Local Court and pleaded guilty to contravening an apprehended violence order on Monday.   

Moody's barrister Geoff Harrison told Magistrate Scott Nash her ex-boyfriend had contacted Moody first and booked her an Uber to his house.   

The matter was adjourned for sentencing on November 11.

Moody was ordered to report to police three times a week in exchange for avoiding a curfew.
