She might have lost a million listeners on her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show, but Zoe Ball is still going up in the world.

I can reveal that she’s splashed out an estimated £1.5 million on a country mansion built by a Russian aristocrat.

The six-bedroom property, which was created by Baron Vladimir de Wolff in the 1920s, has a swimming pool, tennis court and acres of gardens.

Zoe, who is going out with construction boss Michael Reed, will count TV presenter Piers Morgan among her neighbours in the Sussex village. 

‘It’s much bigger and grander than her former home and will offer her more privacy,’ a local tells me.

Zoe, daughter of former Blue Peter presenter Johnny Ball, has put her 18th century cottage in the Sussex village of Ditchling on the market for £1.25 million, £275,000 more than she paid for it two years ago.

Tatiana's purrfect gift

Such a fan of Netflix Documentary is Lady Tatiana Mountbatten (left), that she’s dressed up as one of the show’s most colourful characters, Carole Baskin (right), an animal rights campaigner who denied claims she murdered her ex-husband

Netflix documentary Tiger King became a must-watch during lockdown and now royal socialite Lady Tatiana Mountbatten has revealed herself as a devotee.

Indeed, such a fan is Tats, left, that she’s dressed up as one of the show’s most colourful characters, Carole Baskin, right, an animal rights campaigner who denied claims she murdered her ex-husband.

For Lady Tatiana’s 30th birthday, her friends paid Baskin to record a personalised greeting online.

‘Life made,’ purrs Lady Tatiana, whose father, the Marquess of Milford Haven, is the Queen’s cousin. ‘I’m officially a cool kitten.’
