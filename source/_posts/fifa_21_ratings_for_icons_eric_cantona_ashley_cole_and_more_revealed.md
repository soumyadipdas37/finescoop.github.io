With only a few weeks to go until the October 6 release of FIFA 21, EA Sports has been revealing all the player ratings. Now, fans get to see how today's stars stack up to the legends of the past with the unveiling of the new Icons.

FIFA 21 will have 100 Icons in this year, featuring some of the best players from yesteryear. 

Stars such as Eric Cantona, Ashley Cole, and Fernando Torres have been included, and will be top picks for the game's Ultimate Team mode, where players can build their dream squad from scratch. 

EA Sports has revealed the ratings for the new additions to the list of Icons in FIFA 21

Eric Cantona is one of the best players included in this year's FIFA 21 Ultimate Team mode

The game will have 100 Icons this year, allowing greats from the past to compete once again

Ferenc Puskas - 94

Xavi - 93

Eric Cantona - 93

Samuel Eto'o - 92 

Fernando Torres - 91

Philipp Lahm - 91 

Bastian Schweinsteiger - 91

Petr Cech - 91

Nemanja Vidic - 90

Davor Suker - 90 

Ashley Cole - 89 

But it's Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas who is the highest rated of the new additions, with a 94 overall rating. 

The centre-forward, who now has FIFA's award for the best goal of the year named after him, will be a huge threat up front, with 91 pace, 92 dribbling, and 96 shooting.

His huge rating even puts him above Lionel Messi (93), who is the highest rated of the current players in FIFA 21, just pipping Cristiano Ronaldo to the top spot once again.  

As for the legends, Cantona and Barcelona icon Xavi are just behind Puskas with overall ratings of 93, and Xavi's old team-mate Samuel Eto'o isn't far off either, with a rating of 92.

Eto'o will be particularly sought after in Ultimate Team, where a player's pace is one of the most important attributes.

With 95, that puts him just behind Kylian Mbappe (96) and Adama Traore (96) as one of the fastest players in the game.  

Going down one more tier, we find four more legends sitting on a similar rating.

Bayern Munich Germany heroes Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger are both sitting on a 91 rating.

Schweinsteiger will be a rock in the middle of the park, with 86 rating in defending and physical stats, and he's got a serious pass (89) and shot (86) on him too.  

Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas is the highest rated of the new Icons in Ultimate Team

Former Liverpool player Fernando Torres will be a dangerous threat up front in the game

Meanwhile Torres (91) will be a threat up front, while Petr Cech will take care of all your goalkeeping needs at the back, also rated at 91.  

Davor Suker is another striker who will be causing problems this year, although his pace doesn't quite stack up to some of the other players on the list.

Rounding out the list of new Icons are a couple of the Premier League's best ever defenders.

Nemanja Vidic is rated at 90 overall, while Cole will be an asset in the left-back position, with an 89 rating.  

Nemanja Vidic, Philipp Lahm, and Davor Suker all have solid cards in the popular mode as well

Ashley Cole is coming to the game with his 89-rated Prime FUT Icon Ultimate Team card

These are each player's 'Prime' rating, from when they were having the best time of their career.

Each Icon also comes with two other cards, from their early career, and later on, and although they are slightly lower rated, they will still be extremely effective in the game.   

Bastian Schweinsteiger and Petr Cech round out the list of 11 new Icons for this year's game
