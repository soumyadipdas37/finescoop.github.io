Footage of water rushing into a livestock ship before it sunk in the East China Sea was filmed by one of the two Australians on board. 

New Zealand man, Scott Harris, 37, is seen standing in ankle deep water as it floods a cabin inside the Gulf Livestock 1 a day before it capsized and sank on September 2.

As the ship sways in the ocean water is seen gushing from one side of the vessel to the other while Mr Harris grips the wall for support. 

'Really safe, really really safe,' the man filming is heard saying. 

The clip then cuts to footage from outside the ship, which was carrying 43 crew and 5,800 cows, showing heavy conditions bearing down on them, One News reported.

'Pretty wild weather,' the Australian says as the video ends. 

Two Australians and another Kiwi man were among the ship's crew when it capsized and sank in dangerous seas created by Typhoon Maysak.

Lukas Orda, 25, from the Gold Coast and Sydney man William Mainprize, 25, were identified as the two Australians on board. 

Mr Orda had just welcomed his first child in March before joining the ship in June. 

The vessel left New Zealand on August 14 and was due to arrive at the Port of Jingtang in Tangshan, China on Saturday. 

As it headed across the East China Sea it began to flounder and the crew battled to keep it afloat.

Footage emerged showing the panicked crew trying to stem the flow of water in the hours before it sank. 

Seawater inundated the interior of the vessel and was seen cascading over the electrics and machinery. 

The dramatic images emerged as it was revealed Japan's coast guard had rescued a second survivor on Friday. 

Hours earlier, an unconscious crew member was also recovered but later died.

The first survivor, a Filipino crewman, was found floating in the East China Sea in a life jacket on the same night the ship was lost.

Typhoon Maysak was blowing by southern Japan when the vessel sunk and its instruments showed that it was sailing into high winds of 56 knots.

The captain of Gulf Livestock 1 sent a distress call to the Japanese Coast Guard at about 1.20am on Wednesday.

Rescuers in an aircraft and four boats plus divers searched for survivors and found a bundle of orange rope and a life jacket with the ship's name on.

Then on Friday they found a body and multiple dead cows in the waters near where the ship sank.   

The Japanese Coast Guard resumed the search on Monday after having to suspend operations for 48-hours due to heavy winds from a second storm, Typhoon Haishen.
