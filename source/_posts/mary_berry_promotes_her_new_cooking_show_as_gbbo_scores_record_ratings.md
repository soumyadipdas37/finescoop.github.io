She went on: 'I am very lucky to have all these experiences I really enjoy them, great to have a go.

'I went up to Yorkshire to Whitby I have never been in weather that was more torrential or had to cook in it, it was a great experience.'

'I had a lot of phone conversations with friends I hadn't spoken to in a long time, especially at my age i have a lot of widow friends who were stranded and alone so we had a lot of phone conversations.'

The show marked the biggest Great British Bake Off launch Channel 4 has seen since it started airing the show in 2017, following seven years at the BBC.

The peak of 7.9 million (average audience 6.9 million) marks Channel 4’s biggest broadcast of 2020 to date and the channel’s highest rating broadcast since the series nine final of Bake Off in 2018.

Ready, set, bake! Lockdown delayed the start of Great British Bake Off's series 11 but it was worth the setbacks for Channel 4 as ratings show the series opener scored record ratings 

The start of Tuesday night's show was delayed by 15 minutes to make room for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's address at 8pm, which three million people tuned in for on Channel 4. 

Bake Off played up to the schedule clash, opening the episode with new presenter Matt Lucas impersonating a bumbling Boris who urged viewers to 'Stay Alert, Protect Cake and Save Loaves.'

The series had already seen it's start date pushed back by a month from its usual late August slot after filming was delayed by lockdown.

The production worked to ensure COVID-19 restrictions would not impact the close-knit nature of the show.
