Halsey recently celebrated a milestone, with the fifth anniversary of the release of her debut studio album.

And the two-time Grammy nominee has come quite a long way since dropping Badlands back in 2015.

She celebrated 3billion Spotify streams Monday, as she shared a video of herself enjoying a feast of champions out of her award plaques, while calling out Drake.

The 25-year-old revealed a black plaque for 1billion streams of the 2016 Chainsmokers song Closer, on which she's featured, and another for her 2018 single Without Me.

Her awards each featured a round silver dish with the Spotify logo, which she filled with Takis and some M&M's.

Halsey had the camera pan up from the table, as she enjoyed a glass of rosé and a Taki, as she said: 'And they owe me one more too.' 

She appeared to refer to the 2018 track Eastside, on which she collaborated with Khalid and Benny Blanco, also surpassing a billion streams.
