Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has admitted that his Manchester United side only deserved a point following a dramatic end to their 3-2 victory over Brighton.

The Red Devils managed to walk away with all three at the AMEX on Saturday after Bruno Fernandes scored a game-winning penalty in the 100th minute, following a VAR review after the full-time whistle had been blown.

It looked as if United had dropped two points following a stoppage-time equaliser from Solly March, moments before the visitors would go up the other end and claim for a Neal Maupay handball from a Harry Maguire header.

Referee Chris Kavanagh blew the final whistle but furious protests from Maguire and his United team-mates saw the action restart following a VAR review, allowing Fernandes to score the resulting penalty, leaving the Seagulls stunned.

And Solskjaer, having seen his team ride their luck on more than one occasion, concedes that one point would've been what United deserved. 

'You cannot sum it up, it is emotions and drama, we got away with one to be fair,' Solskjaer said after the game. 

'When they equalised that is two points lost, or maybe one point was what we deserved, we didn't deserve more, but the character deserves more.

'That is a big thing for us compared to last season, when we had too many draws.

'First of all, you have to be happy Jose is not here to measure their goal posts. But they created too much for my liking, we don't really have the legs and sharpness but we will get there.

'For me, Paul is not attempting to get onto the lad, so for me there is no contact.

'Plenty of work to do be done, sometimes you need to take the points and know that there is lots to work on.'

The dramatic end saw United walk away with all three points after a strong Brighton display 

United managed to get themselves into a winning position thanks to a Lewis Dunk own goal and a superb solo effort from Marcus Rashford either side of half-time, cancelling out Maupay's first-half penalty.

However, after striking the woodwork five times, Brighton couldn't wrap the game up and will feel aggrieved they didn't come away with anything at the end. 

The win at the AMEX is United's first win of the season, following their disappointing defeat to Crystal Palace on the opening day at Old Trafford.
