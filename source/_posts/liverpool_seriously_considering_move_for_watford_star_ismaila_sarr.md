Liverpool have enquired about Ismaila Sarr and discussed his situation with Watford, with the Reds are weighing up their transfer options.

No bid has been made yet, but he is being seriously considered as a backup option for Liverpool's front three.

Watford would want at least £36million for the forward, who joined the club last year.

The Hornets will be holding onto their man as they look to rebound straight back into the Premier League for next season, but may be willing to part for the right price. 

He signed for Watford for £30 million last summer, and went on to score six goals and provide six assists in 30 appearances in all competitions.  

Sarr proved his worth to Jurgen Klopp when he scored twice in Watford's surprise 3-0 win over the champions in February, one of Liverpool's three losses of the season.

If a deal is done, it would be another departure for Watford, who may lose captain Troy Deeney before the end of the transfer window if a top flight club comes knocking.

Meanwhile Liverpool have agreed a deal worth £25million with Bayern Munich for Thiago Alcantara, after chasing the Spaniard all summer.
