Footy WAG Rebecca Judd has revealed that her nine-year-old son, Oscar, is going on school camp later this week, despite the stage-four lockdown in Melbourne.

The model-turned-entrepreneur, 37, revealed on Tuesday's 3pm Pick-Up that Oscar was preparing for his first ever overnight camp... at home via Zoom.

The 'virtual camp' for year three students was introduced because coronavirus restrictions in Victoria made an actual excursion impossible.

'My son Oscar has his year three camp coming up,' Rebecca began.

She explained that her eldest child will stay at home for the duration of the 'trip', and has been given a number of tasks and activities to keep him occupied.

'We got a big list of all the things sent home to prepare,' the mother of four said.

The parents at Oscar's school were told to make space and provide play equipment for their children to build forts and cubby houses.

School administrators also sent a tongue-in-cheek letter asking for 'permission to tear the house apart'.

Rebecca added: 'Bush art is needed to be collected. We have a list of gum nut sticks, twigs, rocks... 

'There's a Minute to Win It game, so we need plates, biscuits - chocolate-coated will give the best result.'

Rebecca called her son from the radio studio, and he explained that the first night will involve his class cooking chicken schnitzels at home and watching a movie.

The Judds' children are being home-schooled as Melbourne remains under stage-four lockdown following a deadly second wave of COVID-19.

Rebecca often jokes that her kids are too much to handle, sharing videos to Instagram highlighting the mess they cause around the house on a daily basis.

She and her husband, retired AFL star Chris Judd, share four children, son Oscar, daughter Billie, five, and twin boys Tom and Darcy, three.
