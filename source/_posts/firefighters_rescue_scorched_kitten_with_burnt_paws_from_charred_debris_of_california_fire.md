A firefighter rescued a small kitten that survived the deadly Bear Fire in California, and an Oregon woman discovered her farm animals were alive after an inferno burned down her barn as veterinarians have continued to care for animals affected by the West Coast wildfires.     

Concerning fire activity continued across several western states, like California and Oregon, on Monday after some 94 large fires have scorched 4.6million acres so far.  

Emergency crews have been diligent in their quest to protect residents, including a small kitten found alone in Northern California.

Daniel Trevizo, a Los Angeles County Fire Department captain assigned to the North Complex, told Record Searchlight that his team was working when they heard the tiny kitten.

'While we were cleaning up an area we heard meowing and sure enough, this little kitten comes running up as friendly as can be,' said Trevizo.  

The charred landscape was still letting off tendrils of smoke as the kitten darted through the area in search of safety and shelter. 

After taking a quick video of the kitten, Trevizo placed it in the pocket of his fire jacket while he and his crew watered down embers near Lake Oroville.

'We're going ahead and keeping him safe and secure until we can drop him off to animal control,' he said. 

The extent of the kitten's injuries weren't clear at first, but Trevizo thinks the animal may have been singed in the flames and suffered burnt paws.

'I'll try to secure some food (at the base camp) for the little kitten here and see that it gets properly fed,' he told the publication. 'He's a good little fire cat.'

Trevizo added that he saw in a firefighters' text message group that another fire captain had discovered a cat hidden in debris and rescued it. 

'Fire Cat' is just one of many local animals who've been displaced and injured amid the wildfires, leaving Animal Control crews and veterinarian groups scrambling for resources amid evacuations.

More than 500 miles north, Patti Candell was shocked to find that her home in Mehama, Oregon was still standing after evacuations forced residents to flee.

Candell's home was in the path of the Beachie Creek Fire, which has killed at least four people and burned more than 188,900 acres. As of Monday, it is still zero per cent contained. 

Most of the homes and structures in Candell's neighborhood were destroyed, including her horse stable and barn.

The large amount of wildfire across the West Coast have inundated the skies with a smokey haze that continued to cling over the weekend after fires sparked

'It's just, you know, devastating, devastating,' she told CNN. Somehow, all her sheep and cows had survived the raging wildfire.

'The barn is, well its back there, you can see just that pile of white stuff. It's there, it's a big, huge 30-by-48 (foot) horse barn, three stalls and all that fun stuff. And yeah, it was wiped out,' Candell said. 

Her house is just one of a handful that are still standing in Mehama.

'The flames actually came up to the house on this side of the home and on the back and how it didn't catch on fire is just amazing to us,' said Candell. 'It just, I don't know how the fire works, how the wind is.'

Butte County in Northern California was also the subject evacuations, and is where Animal Control found a puppy wounded by the fire on Saturday. 

'As BCSO deputies and members of BCSO Search and Rescue were searching through properties impacted by the fire, they made an unexpected and welcomed discovery on a large property in Berry Creek, this adorable puppy,' the Butte County Sheriff's Office on Facebook.

Authorities named the puppy 'Trooper'  (center) and transported it to the Valley Oaks Veterinary Center in Chico, California, to be checked out for injuries 

A brief investigation by authorities revealed that 'Trooper's' owner had several other dogs and was not able to locate all of them before evacuations began

Photos shared by the department showed the scared puppy covered in dirt and soot as an Animal Control crew member held it tightly. The property where they discovered the puppy has been completely devastated and the air holds a smoky quality to it.

The puppy suffered some minor burns and was taken to Valley Oaks Veterinary Center in Chico, California, to be checked out.

Authorities did some investigating and learned that the owner of damaged home has several dogs and was not able to locate them all before evacuations set in.

'Our deputies decided to give this sweet puppy a name, Trooper,' the Facebook post read.

In Oregon, almost a dozen cats rescued amid scorching wildfires are being cared for at a veterinary hospital and staff members have posted their photos on social media hoping to reunite them with their owners.

The cats have burned paws covered in bandages. Some of their bellies are seared and, in one case, a cat nicknamed Depot because he was found by the Home Depot, is hooked up to oxygen because its lungs suffered damage from the hot smoke.

Rory Applegate, a veterinarian at Southern Oregon Veterinary Specialty Center, says staff members are working even though some of them have had to evacuate or had family impacted by the blazes.

Applegate says the fires are a 'huge emotional toll' on the staff but they are balancing out the management of critical patients and making sure they can stay stable themselves.

She said she expects animals to feel the impact of the heavy smoke in the coming days, too.

The group created a GoFundMe to collect donations for supporting local animals and pets amid the wildfires.

'These fires have decimated our communities and have limited the functionality of our local pet rescues and support agencies,' the group wrote in a message. 

'We established this GoFundMe to receive these funds for use within our community to support displaced and injured pets, to provide resources for our local pet rescues, and to provide critical funding for financially challenged fire victims.'

The fundraiser has received $34,000 of its $100,000 goal. 

Meanwhile, a 'firenado' has been captured on camera in California as wildfires tear through large swathes of the west coast, killing at least 35 people. 

Footage showing a wildfire meeting a column of air to create a tornado-like effect was posted on TikTok on Thursday went viral over the weekend.

Social media users nicknamed the state 'Hellifornia', with one writing: "2020 said 'Hey, y'all know what's missing? A firenado! That would be so awesome! I got the perfect place, too. Here me out...."' one person wrote.

Another posted to Twitter: '2020 is something straight out of a dark science fiction novel, y'all ever seen a tornado on fire?'

The clip was posted as firefighters in California were bracing for a shift in weather that could bring stronger winds Monday and stoke dozens of fires still raging across the state.

California this week experienced what's being dubbed a 'firenado'. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for Northern California through Monday night, saying strong southerly winds and low humidity will result in elevated fire weather conditions across the region

Dozens of wildfires are raging throughout West as record high temperatures and dry vegetation fuel the fast-moving, destructive blazes, destroying hundreds of acres

The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for Northern California through Monday night with Incident Meteorologist Dan Borsum saying strong southerly winds and low humidity will result in elevated fire weather conditions across the region.

He said conditions may improve a little bit Tuesday but not a lot. Borsum added that the air quality in the region may not improve until October.

More than 16,750 firefighters were doing battle with fires that had already killed 22 people, destroyed more than 4,100 structures and engulfed scores of communities from the Oregon border to Mexico.

Then a Northern California sheriff said Sunday that two more people have died from wildfires, bringing the state's total death toll to 24. Oregon had 10 fatalities and a one-year-old boy died in Washington.

The fires on the West Coast have been among the worst ever recorded. In California over 3.2 million acres were charred last month.

There was also a warning in effect in Oregon on Sunday night after the weather service said that the wind, humidity and fire danger will 'likely contribute to a significant spread of new and existing fires.'

Gusts of wind are expected to reach up to 40 mph.

At least 10 people were killed in wildfires that burned the past week throughout Oregon where 35 fires have devastated 902,620 acres.

Officials have said more people are missing from other blazes and the number of fatalities is likely to rise.

Andrew Phelps, Oregon's emergency management director, said that the state was preparing for a 'mass fatality incident.'

'There are going to be a number of fatalities, folks who just couldn't get warning in time and evacuate their homes and get to safety,' Phelps told MSNBC on Friday.

One resident told Reuters about the scene in the town of Pheonix, 'It looks like a war just happened here,'

The fire melted the motor right out of my truck - it drained down the driveway,' said Manson, a 43-year-old construction worker. 'I lost everything. I lost all my tools. My truck. I can't work. I lost $30,000 worth of guitars. All gone.'

Nearly a week after wildfires ignited across Oregon, which forced thousands of residents to flee their homes, firefighters spent Sunday setting and holding containment lines and starting to assess the damage.

Upper McKenzie Rural Fire Chief Christiana Rainbow Plews and several of her colleagues in Oregon lost their homes in the Holiday Farm Fire.

She left her home to respond to a downed power line and said the fire it caused quickly spread, making her issue a level 3 evacuation order within a couple of hours.

'I not only have my life to put back together, I also have a fire department to put back together,' Plews told NBC News. 'And I honestly don't know how I'm going to do that.'

She said many people on her team worked a week straight with only a 24 hour rest period by Sunday when the blaze had burned 161,872 acres and was only five per cent contained.

The US Forest Service said weather conditions in areas of the state, which include mist and favorable wind, was helping to limit the rapid spread of the blaze and dispersing smoke and fog to better firefighting conditions.

Two of the Oregon's largest fires that continue to threaten communities in Clackamas and Marion Counties remained completely uncontained Sunday, but more favorable weather and an easing of some evacuation warnings in areas indicate an improving situation.

One of the large fires ravaging the area, the Riverside Fire was still within half a mile of the small city of Estacada, but the spread of the blaze has slowed.

In Marion County, where firefighters have been battling the Lionshead and Beachie Creek fires, evacuation levels of several cities were reduced during the weekend.

People in central and northeast Oregon, including in Eugene, Portland and Salem, continued to face hazardous air quality Sunday.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality reported Air Quality Index numbers that were off the chart.

Air Quality Index is considered hazardous between 301 and 500. Portland´s index is currently at 426.

Values above 500 - which two cities, Madras and Roseburg both reported having - are beyond the index´s scale.

Officials advised people to stay indoors and that the low visibility, caused by fog and smoke, is creating hazardous driving conditions.

In Salem, where the Air Quality Index is 394, a dense smokey haze that clouded roads and homes made it difficult to see further than 50 yards ahead.

The National Weather Service in Portland reported that rain is expected Monday night, which could help clear smoke in Oregon next week.
