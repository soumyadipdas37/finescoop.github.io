Premier Daniel Andrews has taken responsibility for his 'captain's call' of night curfews in Melbourne to help Victoria Police enforce Stage Four lockdowns.

Five million Melburnians are currently banned from leaving their homes each night between 8pm and 5am under some of the harshest coronavirus restrictions in the world.

The night curfew, which has now been in place for 57 days, will be eased to 9pm to 5am from 11.59pm on September 13.

Andrews claimed on Wednesday that he only introduced Melbourne's overnight curfew to make it easier for police to enforce lockdown.

But in an extraordinary retort, Victoria Police's Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said he did not request a curfew and that he only found about the new law hours before the public was told. 

Andrews was also forced to backflip his previous admissions he'd taken advice about the curfew from chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton when he revealed he wasn't responsible for the restrictions.

When Chief Commissioner Patton was asked if police were consulted about the curfew by 3AW Neil Mitchell on Thursday morning, he replied: 'No.'

'At no stage?' Mitchell quizzed further.

Again Comissioner Patton replied: 'No.'

'The reality is I was never consulted … our policy area was provided a copy of the proposed guidelines for our information a couple of hours before they were signed off.'

Commisioner Paton admitted the night curfew has made it easier for his officers to police the city.

'We are able to enforce with the curfew and movement is very much restricted because of it … but we weren't involved in discussions over it,' he added.

He also admitted police found out about the night curfews a few hours before being made public on August 2.

Mr Andrews was initially reluctant to identify himself as the person responsible for the curfew during his daily press conference on Wednesday.

'I can't pinpoint the individual and the day, I can't give you a specific person,' he told reporters.

'If you want to go out and be unlawful now police have got the easiest set of arrangements they have ever had to catch you and fine you. That's what a curfew delivers.'  

Following grilling by reporters, Mr Andrews finally buckled under pressure and admitted it was his decision to implement the night curfew. 

'It's consistent with the health advice,' he stressed.

'These are decisions ultimately made by me, so the answer to the question (of why there is a curfew) is, I've made that decision. It's a challenging one to make, but it's effective.'

He added the night curfew was about achieveing health outcomes. 

'It's not a matter for Brett [Sutton], that's not health advice, that's about achieving a health outcome,' the Premier said.

'His advice is 'do whatever you can to limit movement'. Police then say 'we need rules we can enforce'. These are decisions ultimately made by me.'

'It just makes the job of police much, much easier.'

The state opposition was quick to slam the Premier following his starting admission that the curfew wasn't based on health advice.

'It wasn't a Brett Sutton call, it wasn't a medical evidence call, it was a captain's call by the Premier who wanted to keep Melbourne in curfew,' Victorian Liberals Leader Michael O'Brien said. 

'The curfew should go. When you consider how extreme a curfew is – in wartime we haven't been subject to a curfew.' 

 

Meanwhile, Professor Sutton revealed medical experts did not request the curfew but it was brought in as the state government declared a state of disaster on August 2. 

'The curfew came in as part of the state of disaster... it wasn't a state of emergency requirement,' Professor Sutton told Melbourne radio station 3AW.

'It wasn't something that I was against from a public health perspective. 

'I was consulted on it but it was a separate decision-making pathway.'

Professor Sutton was also asked for his personal opinion on the effectiveness of the curfew during Tuesday's interview. 

'I haven't reflected on it, I think it has been useful. If I put my mind to it, probably,' he said.  

Professor Sutton denied any rumours that he had fallen out with Mr Andrews and said: 'We've worked very well together.'

'I get along pretty well with all sorts hopefully across the political spectrum and across all the various personality types,' he said.

'My gig is to provide straight up robust advice.

'I'm pretty comfortable with giving it, maybe when it's not comfortably received.'  

Under Mr Andrews' road map to easing restrictions, released on Sunday, lockdown will only end when there are an average of five cases per day, which is not expected in Melbourne until October 26. 

Until then, a curfew will be in place from 9pm to 5am and residents can only leave home for exercise, shopping, school and work, and caregiving.  

Step one: The first step will come in to place on September 13.

Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. 

Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.

Step four: The move to step four will come when there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on November 23.
