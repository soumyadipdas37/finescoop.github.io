A set of maps of Sydney has shown how the city developed and spread over the 250 years from Captain Cook's landing up to today.

The maps were made using sources from the National Library of Australia as well as early drawings, maps, directories and government documents. 

Insurance company Budget Direct created the maps using information from the Office of Environment & Heritage and uploaded them to the company's blog.  

A set of incredibly detailed maps have shown Sydney's most important developments since it was colonised almost 250 years ago (Map of Sydney in the year 1770 pictured) 

The city was originally colonised by convict settlers before rapidly expanding into a hub of suburbs. The University of Sydney was established by 1858 (map of Sydney pictured) 

The first map was based on a sketch from when Captain James Cook arrived in Sydney in 1770 during his voyage of discovery from the British crown. 

It was drawn during the first survey of the area and outlined the coast of modern day Botany Bay.  

European settlement began when 1,485 convict settlers landed in New South Wales with the First Fleet on January 26, 1788. 

The penal colony established at Sydney Cove included men's and women's prison camps, the government's mansion and a farm. 

By 1799 the colony had expanded to establish a road from the city to a government house in Parramatta and civilian colonies around modern Concord, Ryde, Gladesville and Lane Cove areas.   

The early city and suburbs of Sydney were planned out by 1822 and York Street, George Street, Pitt Street and Macquarie Street were added to the town grid.   

By 1858, there were facilities still in use today such as the University of Sydney, the Australian Museum and the Sydney Cricket Ground.   

By 1984 Sydney had developed into a metropolitan city of suburbs connected by highways and train lines (pictured). Structures like the Opera House and Harbour bridge had also been built

The city established major structures like Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney Football Stadium and the M2 Hills motorway by the year 2000 (map of Sydney in 2000 pictured) 

The illustration of Sydney in 1894 was based on rail maps and showed a new tram system, the 'Great Western', 'Great Southern' and 'Great Northern' railways. 

It also included the State Library, Art Gallery of NSW and The Strand Arcade. 

By 1934 Sydney had completed the Queen Victoria Building, Sydney Harbour Bridge, a high-rise building and developed new roads to connect the city.  

The city's urbanisation continued at a rapid pace and a 1948 map by the Cumberland County Council showed the first town plan of metropolitan Sydney.    

Former NSW minister for planning Bob Carr later commissioned a map to mark the 200th anniversary of Sydney's colonisation, inspiring the 1988 illustration.  

By 2000 the Harbour City had developed Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney Football Stadium and opened the M2 Hills motorway.  

Sydney continued to grow into the 21st century and by 2017 the city had established a focus on creating green spaces such as Barangaroo in the CBD.  

The final map of Sydney showed a snapshot of the city from Google Earth and revealed the true extent of its expansion to a bustling city of over 5 million people.  

Sydney continued to expand further west and developed to house over 5 million people in 2020 (Map of Sydney in 2020 pictured)
