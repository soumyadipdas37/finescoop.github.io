Manchester City have discussed Sevilla defender Jules Kounde as a potential alternative to Kalidou Koulibaly as they continue to hunt for a long-term partner for Aymeric Laporte.

The 21-year-old insisted he was staying with Sevilla on Thursday but is seen as a more viable option for City than his defensive partner, Diego Carlos. 

City and Napoli remain at an impasse over Koulibaly, with the Serie A side demanding more than £70m.

Manchester City are considering making a move for Sevilla central defender Jules Kounde

Guardiola admires Atletico’s Madrid’s Jose Gimenez but they insist he will only be sold for his buy out clause of £90m. 

City are fielding interest from Galatasaray for veteran Fernandinho but Guardiola would rather the Brazilian remain at the Etihad Stadium.

The 35-year-old's current contract with City is set to expire at the end of June next year.

So far in this transfer window City have signed Ferran Torres from Valencia and Nathan Ake from Bournemouth. 

Guardiola's side get their Premier League campaign underway on Monday when they face Wolves away.
