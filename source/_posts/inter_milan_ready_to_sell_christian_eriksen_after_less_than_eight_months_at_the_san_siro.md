Inter Milan are looking to sell Christian Eriksen less than eight months after signing him from Tottenham in January, according to reports.

After a tricky few months in North London, Inter agreed to sign the midfielder for around £16million during the January transfer window. 

Whilst on the surface it appeared to be a great deal for the Serie A giants, the Danish international has failed to impress under boss Antonio Conte.

Eriksen has managed to score just once and provide two assists from 17 Serie A matches after joining midway through the campaign.

Conte is willing to sell the former Tottenham star and is hoping for a fee around £44million, reported Corriere dello Sport.

The ex-Chelsea boss has noted Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal as a target this summer but would need the funds from selling Eriksen in order to pursue the Chilean.

Vidal has been one of the several Barcelona stars to be shunned out by new manager Ronald Koeman.

In response, the 33-year-old hit out at his own club for only having '13 professional players', so many youth products in the first team and relying too heavily on Lionel Messi.

Whilst it appears that Nicolo Barella and Marcelo Brozovic will remain in Conte's plans heading into the new season, Eriksen's place in the team is less certain.

After his poor start to life with the Nerazzurri club, Eriksen may fail to attract much attention from potential buyers - especially with Inter asking for £44million.
