Coles is taking on Aldi Australia with its new Best Buys camping range set to launch in all stores on September 4.  

The supermarket is set to unveil 30 new products - including a $59.99 four-person dome tent, $19.99 sleeping bag, 'deluxe' camping chairs and a folding table.

The affordable camping range will hit shelves at 108 stores across New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria from Friday, September 4 as part of the chain's new 'Best Buys', which launches every fortnight.
