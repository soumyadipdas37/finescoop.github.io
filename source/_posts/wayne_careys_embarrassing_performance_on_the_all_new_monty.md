AFL legend Wayne Carey is one of 15 Australian stars in the line-up for Channel Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals.

Speaking to the Sunday Herald Sun, the 49-year-old revealed how it took a lot of courage to strip off and perform a burlesque act on the show.

'It (the performance) was uncomfortable and embarrassing, but there was a sense of achievement once it was over,' he said.

Wayne also revealed that he only signed up for the show for its purpose of raising awareness for men's and women's cancers. 

The retired footballer, who played for the AFL's North Melbourne and Adelaide clubs, will be joined by 14 other stars including Russell Crowe's ex-wife Danielle Spencer.

Danielle, 51, recently told The West Australian that their sons, Charles, 16, and Tennyson, 14, were initially mortified by the idea of her stripping off.

The singer went on to say that while they initially had their doubts, they are supportive, knowing that it will raise breast cancer awareness.

'They've come to terms with it': Russell Crowe's ex-wife Danielle Spencer (pictured), 51, who has also signed on, recently revealed to The West Australian how their children were initially mortified by the thought of her stripping off 

'My sons are a little nervous about it. They were like, "Really? You're what? Oh my God". They'll probably try and hide it from everybody they know, but they've come to terms with it now,' she said.

Danielle added of their initial reaction: 'It was like, "You'll be nude nude? No, just breasts", but, you know, there is a moment in the routine where everything comes out, but then I explained what it was for, and they've been really supportive.'  

The TV gig is especially close to home for Danielle, with her mother Julie Spencer having endured her own breast cancer battle.

Danielle and Wayne will be joined by reality star-turned-actress Sam Frost, national treasure Patti Newton and ex-Australian footballer Tom Derickx.

Better Homes and Gardens presenter Adam Dovile and former Home and Away heartthrob Orpheus Pledger have also been confirmed for the eagerly anticipated televised event.  

An exciting advertisement last month revealed that actor Samuel Johnson and Olympic swimmer Leisel Jones have signed on.

Television presenter Michael Slater, comedian Fiona O'Loughlin, model Erin Holland and personal trainer Shannan Ponton are also in the line-up.

Filmmaker Paul Fenech and author Ash Pollard round up the brave stars who will go naked for the sake of charity. 

The three-part televised event, The All New Monty: Guys and Gals, will premiere on Channel Seven on Sunday September 13.
