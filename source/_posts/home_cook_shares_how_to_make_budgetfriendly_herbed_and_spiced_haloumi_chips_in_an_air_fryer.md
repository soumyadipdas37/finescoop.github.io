A savvy Australian home cook has made herbed and spiced haloumi chips in her three-in-one air fryer, wowing hundreds of foodies with how simple it is.

The Melbourne woman shared images along with the recipe to a cookery Facebook group after attempting the dish as a quick and easy dinner option.

'Tried mixing up the everyday haloumi chip with some herbs and spices for a bit of a flavour kick!' she said.

The crispy and flavoursome haloumi chips were served with Greek yoghurt mixed with Yumi's garlic dip.

In an attempt to make something new for dinner, a savvy Australian home cook has made herbed and spiced haloumi chips in her three-in-one air fryer

The recipe is very easy to follow and only takes 20 minutes to cook the haloumi pieces in the large air fryer at 180 degrees Celsius, but an oven can also be used. 

Hundreds of eager home cooks tagged friends and family members in the comments to share the recipe throughout the online community.

'I am definitely trying these!' one woman said.

'You would love this,' another said, and a third added: 'Looks delicious!' 

To make the chips, the woman used seven ingredients – haloumi cheese, plain flour, an egg, panko breadcrumbs, smoked paprika, Italian herbs and pepper to season 

She first cut the cheese into chip slices, then dipped each one in a bowl of flour and paprika, then egg then finally into the panko breadcrumbs mixed with the herbs (pictured)

When making the chips, it's important to ensure each cheese slice is fully coated in the breadcrumbs to create an even crispy layer. 

The chips were then cooked in the air fryer for 20 minutes until golden brown.

The recipe adds to a list of growing meals shared among the popular Facebook group.

INGREDIENTS

* 1 pack (180g) haloumi (approx 1cm thick)

* 1/3 cup plain flour

METHOD - using 3-in-1 air fryer

2. Mix flour and paprika into a bowl

3. Beat egg into a second bowl

4. Mix panko crumbs, mixed herbs and pepper into a third bowl

5. Fully coat each chip in the flour mix, then dredge in the egg wash until covered (allowing excess to drip off) and then roll in the crumb mix, pressing the crumb into the chip until fully coated
