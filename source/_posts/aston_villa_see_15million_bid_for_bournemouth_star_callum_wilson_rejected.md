Sources say the bid was for £15m up front and did not include any add-ons.

Newcastle are also interested in the England frontman but are yet to table an offer.

Wilson has been identified as a target by Villa and Newcastle this summer transfer window

A swap deal involving Matt Ritchie plus cash for Wilson has been mooted but insiders say Bournemouth, despite their relegation, will not be selling at a reduced rate, evidenced by the £41million it cost Manchester City to sign Nathan Ake and the £18.5m Sheffield United paid for Aaron Ramsdale.

The 28-year-old has been a standout performer since joining the Cherries in 2014 from Coventry, firing 67 goals in 187 appearances for the club. 

Wilson's impressive displays in the Premier League have also seen him feature in Gareth Southgate's England squad, earning his first call up in November 2018 for games against the United States and Croatia.
