Former Neighbours star Nicola Charles has revealed sordid details of what went on behind the scenes of the long-running soap.

In an interview with the Herald Sun on Friday, the 50-year-old actress-turned-author revealed a producer on the show once offered to pay for her to get a boob job. 

Nicola appeared on the series from 1995 to 2016, and confessed the same producer also encouraged her to leak naked photos.

'I was patted on the knee in a very condescending way and told you can always leak photos of yourself after you wrap with the show to boost your image,' she said.

'It's from days of old that one, naked photos leaked online. This is the same Neighbours' producer who said to me, "Would you like me to buy you a set of tits?"

'I said no thank you, I plan on breast feeding. He said, "It's fine, I've done it for all the other girls," and I said, "Really, I'm okay, thank you."'

Nicola said this all took place during the late '90s, and described it as being 'different times'.

She recounted having her name called out while sitting in the green room one day, and said she was terrified she was in trouble.

'But it was just the general stuff, offering a set of boobs, telling me to behave, what to wear,' she added.

While she refused to name the producer, explaining he's since died, Nicola said he would use money as an incentive for her to do certain things.

'He would say some pretty out there stuff to me about how I looked, my body, the things I said, the direction my career could take, dangle things like money in front of me and say this is how much you could earn,' she explained.

Nicola said the culture of the show appears to have since changed for the better, and praised the series for including minority and gay storylines.
