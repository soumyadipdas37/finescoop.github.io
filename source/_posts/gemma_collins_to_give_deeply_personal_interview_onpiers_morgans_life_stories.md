Gemma Collins will reportedly give a 'deeply personal' interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories.

The former TOWIE star, 39, is said to have spent 'more than six hours' filming the show on Friday in an episode which will air later in the year. 

Gemma will reportedly discuss her 'toxic' on-off relationship with James Argent on the show and some of her previous exes.

The reality star will also be asked about her 'self-made millionaire status' after she was said to have landed a six-figure contract with Wizz Air and £500K fashion deal with In The Style over the summer. 

Gemma and James split for good in July after she posted break-up texts on her Instagram account in which he called her a 'hippo' and a 'fat f**k'. 

The former couple had split in 2019 after Arg, who recently admitted he is a cocaine addict and overdosed twice last year, refused rehab yet the reconciled weeks later.

A source told The Sun On Sunday: 'It was an emotional rollercoaster and Gemma opened up to him about deeply personal subjects, including how toxic her relationship with Arg had become and some exes who were abusive to her.

'It was a cathartic experience, though, and she's proud of how far she's come.' 

MailOnline has contacted ITV, Gemma and Piers' representatives for comment.

Piers resumed filming Life Stories last month where he was joined by Vinnie Jones and Captain Sir Tom Moore for two special emotional episodes.

Meanwhile Gemma and James split for good in July after she posted break-up texts on her Instagram account in which he called her a 'hippo' and a 'fat f**k', after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner and not her.

Yet the reality star went on to apologise to her former beau for releasing the messages.

In a screenshot obtained by MailOnline, the Diva On Lockdown star contacted James in the early hours of the morning.

She wrote: 'I am sorry about putting the messages up, I was just so hurt you suggested an open relationship, it didn't look like a joke when you typed it.

'I was so upset but I shouldn't have put the messages up, that was anger on my part which was wrong. I am so sorry about that x.' (sic)

The series of original messages began with Gemma saying: 'What man pays for another woman!!!', while Arg responded by saying: 'Insensitive.' 

Clearly riled, the blonde said: 'And the woman that saved your life has to pay for herself!!!'

Her next message was masked, but her now-ex responded: 'You are supposed to be treating me you hippo.' 

Moments later, Gemma uploaded another series of messages, where he sent her a plane emoji in reply to a picture of flight details.

'I'll take a mate, I'm not booking it. You said you would be a gentleman!', she penned, before he shockingly said: 'YOU FAT F**K. IVE JUST LOST ANOTHER 2000' (sic). He didn't refer to what he had lost 2000 of.  

It was later reported that Gemma had decided to split with Arg after he told her he wanted to move to Spain and have an open relationship. 

An insider told The Sun: 'Arg went to Spain and he told Gemma that he wants to go back there forever and be in an open relationship.

'Gemma feels like she's done everything she possibly can to help Arg but enough is enough. He said that he wants to stay in Spain for good which is worrying as he is known to have suffered relapses there in the past.

'Gemma was devastated by the conversation and decided to end their relationship entirely - she feels like she had no choice but to walk away.'

The Essex native also uploaded a cryptic post about the 'Top 10 Signs of Emotional Abuse In A Relationship' and 'finding the strength to walk away'.  

She wrote: 'To all who have suffered in lock down or are suffering in general. please please find your strength to walk away.

'There is a better life for you filled with love and respect and always remember the problem isn't within you it's within them. 

'Walk away it's never too late. something will happen one day and you will just say enough is enough. It's in that moment the nightmare is over. this is when you find your strength and this is when you will learn self love.' (sic)  

Arg recently admitted he is a cocaine addict and suffered two near-fatal overdoses at his home last year with Gemma calling emergency services after his family feared he was dead.  

He checked himself into a 10-week bootcamp at The River rehab facility in Thailand earlier this year where he kicked his habit. 

The couple reconciled late last year after jetting off on holiday to Dubai in a final bid to resolve their issues.  

Gemma originally dumped Arg after he refused rehab and said their relationship was over until he beat his addiction once and for all.

But less than three weeks later, MailOnline exclusively revealed the reality TV pair were spotted holding hands and kissing on a romantic trip to the £250-a-night Palazzo Versace Hotel.

The duo briefly dated in 2012, before embarking on a tumultuous love story from December 2017.
