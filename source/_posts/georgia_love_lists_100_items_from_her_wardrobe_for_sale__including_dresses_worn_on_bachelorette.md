Bachelorette Georgia Love is selling more than 100 pieces from her designer wardrobe this month.

On Monday, the TV journalist revealed a large selection of her pre-loved ensembles and accessories were up for grabs via a live eBay auction.

With bidding starting from $20, Georgia has slashed the prices on her items - including outfits she wore while on her season of The Bachelorette in 2016.

'Prices are SUPER low and the pieces are, if I do say so myself, gorgeous!! All in incredibly good condition,' Georgia told fans.

'A few I wore on The Bachelorette,' she said, with a photo in a red dress shown for a single date on the dating series. 

Georgia found love with her now-fiancée Lee Elliott as the 2016 Bachelorette.

She concluded: 'Most importantly, 100% of the sales will go directly to research and help for those fighting pancreatic cancer.'

In a statement at the time, she said: 'I’ve had such a whirlwind year, such a range of emotions, from meeting Lee to my Mum’s battle, and I want to help as much as I can.'

'I believe it's vital to create awareness around this brutal disease and hopefully do some good and make a change for people like myself and my family, but also to hopefully stop others from having to go through the same thing,' Georgia added.
