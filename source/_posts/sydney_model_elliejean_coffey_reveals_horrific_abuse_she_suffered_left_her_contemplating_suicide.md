A glamorous surfer turned Instagram model has revealed the 'terrifying' abuse she received that left her contemplating ending her life.

Ellie-Jean Coffey - a Sydney-based model and surfer best known for her provocative social media posts - has opened up for the first time about the years of misogyny she endured during her surf career.

The 25-year-old competed on the World Surf League's qualifying series for years after being picked up by sponsors at just 14.

Her dream career quickly turned dark as she started to experience a 'male-dominated' industry she said was rife with abuse and has haunted her ever since.

'At first I thought and believed I was the luckiest girl in the world to be living such a life, and not long after that, the darker side of the surfing industry soon revealed itself to me, and it was terrifying,' Coffey told news.com.au.

'The abuse, both mentally and physically, I endured during my teenage years far away from home with adults in positions of power has haunted me my whole life.' 

Coffey described her career as 'horrible' and said it has taken her years to recover.

After leaving the surf world, the 25-year-old underwent 'intensive therapy' after the abuse almost 'drove her to ending her life'.

Only close family and friends knew of Coffey's suffering and said it would have been easier to recover if more women had highlighted the 'toxic' surfing industry.

The Instagram model revealed managers and people in positions of power often abused many young girls.

'As much as I loved surfing, I just completely broke down. I couldn't continue with all the abuse; it almost drove me to suicide, and I was lucky to go get that therapy and recover from it. And I know a lot of girls in the industry who have a very similar story,' she said.

Coffey described her career as 'horrible' and said it has taken her hears to recover 

Coffey left the professional circuit in 2017 but still surfs for fun while travelling Australia's east coast.

She recently launched her own personal website where subscribers pay a monthly fee to see her adult content and interact with her, which she says is the 'best decision' she has ever made.

In July last year Coffey was left 'disgusted' when a man in his 50s asked her to consider embarking on a 'swinging throuple' relationship. 

The blonde took to social media to address the reason behind her outrage after revealing she was attracted to both men and women. 

'I seriously just think that what sucks about ''coming out'' as bisexual is that people do automatically assume you have massive orgies and sleep with couples,' Ms Coffey posted on Instagram.

She said the idea that all bisexual people enjoyed threesomes was a 'stereotype'.

'There's absolutely nothing wrong with that... and look yes even if that is the case for me I do think a bit of respect goes a long way,' she continued.  

'Would appreciate it if everyone just realised I am still quite young and most of you are fantastic about it but for other bisexual girls the need to instantly sexualise them is not cool.

'It's a big deal to come out and for the first question to be something like ''oh you f*** other couples'' is a little insensitive, something along the lines of ''hey we support you and appreciate who you are'' is the kind of response that is so needed.' 

Coffey said she knows her social media content may be eyebrow raising to some, but doesn't believe anybody has a right to make her feel uncomfortable

Ouch! The 24-year-old from Sydney's northern beaches previously described herself as 'single as f**k' and said she was 'ready to mingle' 

Ms Coffey admitted her social media content could be considered eyebrow raising to some, but said she didn't believe anyone had a right to make her feel uncomfortable.

'To be honest I am putting out what I'm putting out and anyone can say what they want to say … it shouldn't give people permission to write what they write.'

The model is one of the Coffey sisters who were nicknamed the 'Kardashians of Australian surfing', and it's easy to see why.

Her three sisters - Ruby-Lee, Bonnie-Lou, and Holly-Daze, 21 - are rising stars in professional surfing in addition to being 'Instagram famous'. 

Previously speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the siblings hit back at critics who say they shouldn't share so many bikini-clad photos online. 

Speaking on behalf of the family, Holly-Daze said that their behaviour is nothing out of the ordinary for Australian women who enjoy the beach lifestyle. 

'We don't really care what your opinion is, we just do it, and we're okay with it,' Holly-Daze said. 'If you don't like it, don't look at it. So many girls are doing it - and guys.'
