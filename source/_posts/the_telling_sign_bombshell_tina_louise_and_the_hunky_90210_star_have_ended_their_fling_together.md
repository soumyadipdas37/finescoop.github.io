Australian Instagram model Tina Louise has been romantically-linked to hunky 90210 star Brian Austin Green since July. 

But it appears feelings may have cooled between the tattooed bombshell, 39, and the Hollywood actor.

Tina, who boasts a massive 2.4 million followers on Instagram, regularly shares raunchy photographs of herself showcasing her incredible curves.  

No more Brian Austin Green? Australian model Tina Louise has been romantically-linked to hunky 90210 star Brian Austin Green since July, but it appears feelings may have cooled between the tattooed bombshell, 39, and the Hollywood actor

But despite the blonde capturing the attention of millions of followers, it appears Brian is less-than-interested in them. 

In fact, not only has he not 'liked' any of her sexy posts, he doesn't even follow the Australian busty beauty.

Interestingly, Tina also seemingly unfollowed Brian just hours after liking the strapping star's last photo on Instagram.  

Tina has become a bonafide social media star since her fling with Brian made headlines in July.

She was spotted with the Anger Management actor on a Los Angeles beach last month, following rumours the pair had split.

The father-of-four was unable to take his eyes off the bombshell during the outing.  

It comes after Brian told his Instagram followers he would 'never say never' to getting back with his ex and mother of his children, Megan Fox.

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he said during a livestream earlier this month.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added. 

'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'

Megan started dating rapper Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker, less than a month after her split with Brian.
