They recently rekindled their romance after calling it quits last year.

And Yazmin Oukhellou shocked her on-off boyfriend James Lock, 33, during TOWIE on Wednesday as she revealed she might be pregnant.

The reality star, 26, was seen speaking to her beau in the teaser for the next episode and also hiding a Clearblue test in her bag at Gatsby's birthday party.

Big news? Yazmin Oukhellou shocked her on-off beau James Lock as she revealed she might be pregnant in a dramatic teaser clip at the end of Wednesday's episode of TOWIE

Yaz looked serious as she told a stony-faced Lockie: 'I don't know how to say this, but I potentially could be pregnant' in the short clip.  

Although not yet mentioning the possibility of a baby on the way to her pals, Yaz did speak about possibly starting a family with Lockie several times during the show.  

While speaking with mother-of-two Amy Childs, the brunette beauty admitted that she was 'excited for the future' 

When Amy asked if she'd thought about babies yet, Yaz smiled as she replied 'you never know'. 

Dad-to-be? Lockie appeared tense as he listened to Yaz's bombshell news 

During Wednesday's episode Yaz and Lockie were seen working on their relationship, with him asking her to be more romantic.

While out having a drink with the boys Lockie texted his girlfriend saying: 'Coming to yours tomorrow, want some romance. Get your creative juices flowing'.

However this interesting use of words didn't impress Yaz and Amy, who were enjoying a girls pamper night.    

Oh baby! The beauty was also seen hiding a Clearblue pregnancy test in her bag while at Gatsby's birthday party

Keeping a secret? Yaz reached into her bag at while chatting with her pals during the party

Amy said: 'Come on, he needs to do it to you! He should be cooking you dinner, putting petals on your bed.. you're a princess Yaz!'

Sweetly admitting Lockie had been putting in the extra effort recently, Yaz replied: 'I've never really had that. But today he actually washed my car.. but it kinda looks dirtier than before'.  

Later in the show Yaz proved she was serious about giving things another try with Lockie by penning him a hilarious love poem.  

The couple met up with their pals Amber Turner, Dan Edger, Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallet where Yazmin proudly read out her poem.

Coming up: The couple decided to give their relationship another try this year and have previously said they're having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom 

Announcing to the group she had penned the piece about her beau, friend Amber said: 'You can't just do that and not read it to us! We want to hear it.' 

Yazmin then took out a notebook and read aloud: 'Oh James, James, I'm sick of these wine games.  Lockie, you're looking a little bit stocky. Why are you always so cocky? 

'You look good in pink, but your feet really stink.  You've got good chat but sometimes you're a t**t.  

'I love your golden tan, you're a very handsome man. I love the way you look at me like a character from Glee. 

Heartfelt: Yazmin penned a hilarious love poem to show her appreciation for her boyfriend James on the latest episode of The Only Way Is Essex

'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids.'  

Yazmin had dumped Lockie over claims he had cheated on her while they were on a romantic holiday together in Turkey, and has said she still doesn't trust him but wouldn't say 'no' if he popped the question.

Speaking to The Sun, the brunette beauty said: 'We are trying to take things really slow but I know what I am like.

Hilarious: The couple met up with their pals Amber Turner, Dan Edger, Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallet where Yazmin proudly read out her poem

'I do love him and if he did propose to me I would say yes and marry him. I still don't trust him but I do trust him more this time, which is strange because he messed up. But I do believe he has changed.'

Yazmin also revealed that the couple are now having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom after starting during lockdown, which is helping get their broken relationship back on track. 

She added that her family and friends around her are still sceptical about the reunion but that she needs to 'prove everyone wrong'.

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.

Yazmin read: 'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids'
