Real Madrid and Barcelona are renowned for big-money signings but the Spanish giants have both been on a brutal mission to axe dead wood over the past 12 months.  

Zinedine Zidane's men have yet to bring in a new face and are trusting younger stars like Vinicius, while Ronald Koeman is in a race against time to start his so-called 'revolution' before the window slams shut.

However, unlike previous seasons where 'Galactico' signings were the norm in the Spanish capital and Barcelona brought in the latest Premier League star, it is the outgoings over the past 12 months that have really made the headlines.

With both squads seeing some of their key figures - Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi to name but a few - pass well into their thirties, the clubs have clearly had the intention of trying to raise funds to rejuvenate their squads.

However, while the Catalan side have managed to talk Messi off the ledge and Sergio Ramos appears to be an eternal presence for Real Madrid, it is younger players that form a large chunk of the fire sales over the past three transfer windows.

Sportsmail has compiled a combined XI of players that have left the Santiago Bernabeu or Camp Nou since last summer, and it makes for some eye-opening discoveries with the starting XI costing more than £250million.

Keylor Navas was involved in a bizarre swap with Alphonse Areola by signing for PSG

Nelson Semedo is the latest player to leave Barcelona after joining Wolves for £37million

Sergio Reguilon joined Tottenham for £30m last week, as did Gareth Bale on a loan deal

Costa Rica international Keylor Navas - who was sold by Madrid for £13.5m at the back end of the 2019 summer window in a bizarre exchange for young star Alphonse Areola on loan - is the first name on the team sheet and starts as goalkeeper.

Navas has gone on to become PSG's No 1 and helped them reach the Champions League final last season, while Areola finds himself at Fulham this season with young prospect Andriy Lunin playing back-up to Thibaut Courtois.

The latest sale from these two clubs comes in the form of Nelson Semedo, who has just joined Wolves' Portuguese revolution in a deal worth £37m.

He joins former Arsenal and Barcelona centre-back Thomas Vermaelen, now at Vissel Kobe in Japan, and Tottenham's new £30m signing Sergio Reguilon in a back three. 

Semedo and Reguilon have largely operated as full-backs during their careers as opposed to being in a back three but have destructive options ahead of them in midfield.

Everton's free signing James Rodriguez is an ideal example of what Real Madrid are trying to do in the transfer market. The Colombian was no longer wanted by Zidane so they quickly got off him off the wage bill to free up space elsewhere.

Arthur was involved in a whopping £75m deal that saw Miralem Pjanic go the other way

Arthur, meanwhile, was a puzzling departure from Barcelona. The Brazilian, only 24, joined Juventus for a whopping £75m as part of the deal that took Miralem Pjanic, 30, to the Nou Camp.

They are joined centrally by Arturo Vidal, for whom Barcelona only managed to recoup £917,000 when they sold him to Inter Milan earlier this week, and Chelsea star Mateo Kovacic, who sealed a £40m permanent move to Stamford Bridge from Madrid following a season-long loan in 2018/19.

Given Barcelona and Real Madrid's over-reliance in recent years on the likes of Messi, Luis Suarez and Karim Benzema, it is unsurprising to see the combined XI forward line as strong as displayed here.

Gareth Bale returned to the Premier League last week after sealing a dramatic return to Tottenham to put an end to the exile enforced upon him by Zidane for the majority of last season.

Spurs have agreed to pay £13m of his mammoth £26m-a-year wage and Jose Mourinho will hope he can take the club to the next level. With Bale's running pace and power the Welshman slots in on the right-hand side of the attack.

Suarez, now on the brink of completing his move to Atletico Madrid, obviously leads the line.

The Uruguayan may feel hard done by that his time at the Nou Camp has come to an end so abruptly, given his impressive goal and trophy record for the club.

But there was inevitably going to be ruthless departures after the humiliating defeat by Bayern Munich and Suarez is the biggest name to be shown the door so far.

He looks a perfect replacement for Alvaro Morata at Atletico and, under Diego Simeone's leadership, could fire them back into title contention if he can find his shooting boots again. 

Winger Malcom on the other hand had a bizarre 12 months at the Camp Nou, with the former Arsenal target signing for the club in the summer of 2018 before being rather unceremoniously sold for £41m to Zenit Sty Petersburg just a year later.

The signing of Malcom illustrates Barcelona's errors in the transfer market. No real direction or idea of the type of player they want, Barca took a chance on the Brazilian after some impressive performances for Bordeaux and it really backfired.

The bench also includes some of LaLiga's finest talents in their positions, with Jasper Cillessen the back-up to Navas following his £31m move to Valencia, while Atletico Madrid's hero at Anfield last season Marcos Llorente represents £36m worth of talent on a bench full of midfield stars.

Dani Ceballos appears no longer to be in Zidane's plans after returning for a second season-long loan spell at Arsenal, while fellow substitute Ivan Rakitic has returned to his former employers this summer with a £1.3m move to Sevilla.

Former Real Madrid full-backs Achraf Hakimi and Theo Hernandez provide defensive options with the duo now plying their trade in Milan following the Moroccan's £36m move to Inter this summer and the latter's £17m move to AC Milan in 2019. 

Arda Turan also makes the squad. The Turk is the perfect example of how big-money moves and unprecedented expectations have too often led to disappointment at Barcelona, having snuck out of the back door to join Galatasaray on a free transfer this summer. 

These clubs have so often been defined by the superstars they have recruited. But now it appears with both requiring an overhaul sooner rather than later, they may come to regret some of the players too easily let go over the past year.
