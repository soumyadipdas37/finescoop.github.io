Sunny Hostin has accused her former Fox News colleague Megyn Kelly of morphing into a 'right winger' who claims 'there's no black Jesus,' saying they used to be friendly before she 'changed.'

Hostin, 51, and Kelly, 49, were both legal correspondents at Fox News in the early 2000s, and The View host opened up about her relationship with the journalist in her new memoir 'I Am These Truths.' 

'She's changed a bit from the person that I knew,' Hostin, 51, told People, saying they used to have 'a friendly relationship,' but they 'don't anymore.' 

Claims: Sunny Hostin (left) has accused her former Fox News colleague Megyn Kelly (right) of morphing into a 'right winger,' insisting that the journalist has 'changed' 

Throwback: The two were both legal correspondents at Fox News in the early 2000s. Hostin said she was shocked that Kelly claimed 'Santa Claus ain't black, and there's no black Jesus'

Hostin made reference to a few of Kelly's most controversial on-air remarks, saying she wouldn't have said those things when they were colleagues. 

In 2013, Kelly came under fire for declaring on her Fox News show The Kelly File that both Santa Clause and Jesus were white. 

She later had her NBC show Megyn Kelly Today canceled in 2019 following her remarks surrounding the appropriateness of blackface during Halloween.  

 'When I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character,' the journalist said while defending reality TV star Luann de Lesseps' use of blackface to dress like Diana Ross.

Despite later apologizing for the remarks, her show was canceled three days later.

Thoughts: Hostin, who is now a co-host on The View, noted that Kelly's comments were 'really tone deaf for this time in our history — for any time in our history'

'I was shocked that she morphed into this, you know, "Santa Claus ain't black, and there's no black Jesus," this right winger. Because that is not the Megyn that I met, and that is not the Megyn that I knew,' Hostin said. 

'I don't know that that is the real Megyn, the blackface Megyn,' she added. 

Hostin noted that Kelly's comments were 'really tone deaf for this time in our history — for any time in our history.' 

However, she does have good memories of working with Kelly at Fox News.  

'We started at Fox around the same time. We used to do this wonderful segment together called "Is it Legal" on Bill O'Reilly's show, and she studied as much as I did,' she recalled of Kelly.

New venture: Kelly announced earlier this month that she is launching a new podcast called The Megyn Kelly Show

'She was just a wonderful foil. You know, I think we brought the best out in each other,' she added. 'But the minute that camera light turned on, she went for it: She would look directly at the camera, and she would eviscerate me, often. 

'She made me better for it. But off camera, she was delightful and witty and funny and smart.' 

Kelly announced earlier this month that she is launching a new podcast called The Megyn Kelly Show.   

It is the former talk show host's latest venture as an independent journalist as she launches her media company called Devil May Care Media. 

Kelly tweeted the news, writing: 'Some news: I am launching a podcast this month. It'll be free & available pretty much everywhere. No B.S. No agenda. No corporate overlords. Should be fun!'

The podcast is expected to launch the week of September 28 with three new episodes per week and guests that are 'newsmakers, thought leaders and compelling voices.'
