She's spent lockdown with family and her boyfriend at her mother Demi Moore's house in Idaho. 

And Tallulah Willis looked sensational as she posed in a tiny green bikini top while modelling £135 trousers from her own fashion collection on Sunday.

It comes after the mental health advocate and designer, 26, put on a very loved-up display with her beau Dillon Buss during a beach trip over Labor Day weekend.

Tallulah cut a stylish figure as she stood on a rock while surrounded by long grass and posed with her svelte arms in the air.

She flaunted her figure in a structured green bikini top with an underwire detail and thin straps, which she also wore in another post shared back in August.

However the daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis ensured all eyes were on her statement seashell patterned trousers for the snap.

The Dora bottoms are part of Tallulah's Wyllis fashion line and come with two metal charms on the pockets for £135 ($178).

It has been a busy weekend for the brunette beauty, with her also making time to enjoy a trip to the beach in Hyannis, Massachusetts, with her beau Dillon.

In a snap shared with her 332K fans on Instagram Tallulah could be seen leaning towards Dillon as he wrapped one arm around her and placed a kiss on her lips.

Tallulah looked incredible as she put on the loved-up display, donning a bright yellow bikini and green baseball cap which she wore backwards.

Last week the happy couple went to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with the designer posting dreamy snaps from their picturesque vacation.

All in the details: Tallulah wore the Dora trousers from her collection which cost £135 ($178)

The couple held matching buckets and splashed around with a family friend's child, with Tallulah giggling along with the young girl as she and Dillon all held hands.

Tallulah, who has an extensive bathing suit collection, wore a black floral one piece with cutouts on the bodice for the outing.

She captioned the photo, 'pure pure pure elation'. She added, ' ***all 3 water babies have tested negative' referring to their COVID-19 tests results before traveling and seeing friends. 

Tallulah been very open about her struggles with mental health and even an eating disorder.

In honor of September being National Suicide Prevention Month, the brunette beauty Instagrammed a baby photo of herself shot by legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz with a poignant caption. 

'I have low days, and in my lowest of lows, limbs heavy from exhaustion, I have questioned if I have the energy to keep pushing another day. Truly a horrifying sentiment to have swimming in your head' she wrote. 

'But then I try to remember, I do it for her. I do it because she needs a voice, a champion, a Big Kid; To tell her it's ok, that she is safe that she is protected.'

She continued, 'If you look in the mirror and feel like what stares back is not worthy of love and care, if you can’t trust your own intrinsic value as a human being, do it for them. Do it for them until one day, one alarmingly beautiful day, you can do it for yourself.'
