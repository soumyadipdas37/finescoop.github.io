Two women are accused of being part of a paedophile ring that abused at least 12 children and used them to make disgusting videos.

A 39-year-old childcare worker in Townsville is the alleged ringleader who is facing 104 charges, including sexually abusing his own children, siblings, and dogs.

Police have identified 12 potential victims, two boys and 10 girls, aged from infancy to 16, and one alleged victim was an adult.

A 38-year-old woman was charged with possessing and distributing child exploitation material, and burglary, and a 49-year-old woman was cautioned on three counts of bestiality.

A 33-year-old man is also charged with six counts of distributing child exploitation material, accessing such material, drug possession and production, and possessing tainted property.  

The accused paedophile ring has been operating since 1995 when the earlier of the childcare worker's crimes were allegedly committed.

He is also accused of taking images of his victims and distributing them over a number of years.

Detective Senior Sergeant David Miles said a two-year-old girl, who was allegedly one of the victims, was rescued from a home in Cairns earlier this week. 

He said the young girl was allegedly 'passed around as a result of exchanging of drugs'.

Senior Sergeant Miles said some of the alleged crimes may have happened at the childcare centre but most was against the man's own children. 

Investigators have been working closely with the childcare centre involved but would not say what it was called.

Senior Sergeant Miles said the man allegedly targeted vulnerable women with young children.

'He has then been providing them with drugs for the purpose of sedating his victims for the purpose of conducting his offences,' he said.

The man is expected to appear in the Townsville Magistrates Court on September 29. 

His arrest came after an investigation where hard-drives, telephones and USB sticks were seized earlier this week.
