Channel Ten have denied claims The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert dumped his rumoured 'winner' Irena Srbinovska after filming ended. 

Earlier this month, Irena, 31, hinted that she is no longer dating Locky when she liked a comment from a fan who said she was 'too good' for the former Australian Survivor star.

But on Friday, Ten told Daily Mail Australia Locky and the show's winner are 'still in a relationship and very happy'.

'Locky and his chosen lady are still together and very happy,' a Ten spokesperson said.

Earlier this month, the nurse hinted she's no longer dating Locky when she liked the fan comment on Instagram.

'You're too good for him tho!!!' the fan wrote alongside two rose emojis. As reported by The Wash, Irena was among the seven users who liked the comment.

While it's not conclusive evidence, the social media activity suggests that Irena and Locky quietly split after filming the finale in July.

Meanwhile, Irena has been the bookies' favourite since the first episode, but rumours are swirling that she isn't the clear-cut winner like in previous seasons.

Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that Locky actually rejects Irena and chooses Bella Varelis in the finale, but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena.

What does it mean? Last month, Irena hinted she's no longer dating Locky when she liked an Instagram comment from a fan who said she was 'too good' for the former Australian Survivor star

He then makes a sudden turn and begs Irena to take him back, and she tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him.

These rumours are unconfirmed, however, and the outcome of The Bachelor remains a closely guarded industry secret. 

Irena received one of Locky's final four roses on Thursday night alongside, Bella, Bec Cvilikas and Izzy Sharman-Firth.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10. 

Will they go the distance? While it's not conclusive evidence, the social media activity suggests that Irena and Locky (right) quietly split after filming the finale in July
