Pregnant Chrissy Teigen looked radiant in a white and gold kimono, as she ran errands with her husband John Legend and two children in Beverly Hills on Sunday.  

For their outing, the 34-year-old cookbook author stunned in a flowing, robe-like garment, which she paired with a white top, light-wash blue jeans and sandals.  

The model had her hands full, as she held onto her four-year-old daughter, Luna, and toted a large Fendi purse.

The businesswoman then addressed her dreams finally becoming reality in a reflective post.

'I cannot explain what this photo means to me. So many dreams come together,' she said of the smoldering image of herself. 'Very random idea, every silly night text to the team, the little blog from 14 years ago, all manifested there to feed you is fulfilled.'

'But we're very excited, and we're grateful for all the well-wishes we've gotten from people all around the world. Thank you so much.'
