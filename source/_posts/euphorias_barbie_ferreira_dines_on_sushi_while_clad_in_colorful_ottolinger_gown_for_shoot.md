Euphoria star Barbie Ferreira snacked on sushi after getting glam for a high-fashion shoot in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The Brazilian-American 23-year-old looked fabulous in a colorful Ottolinger gown, $565 By Far 'Claude' booties, and Anna Sheffield earrings selected by stylist Chris Horan.

Before enjoying take-out from Sugarfish, make-up artist Kali Kennedy applied green eye shadow to Barbie's brwn eyes and hairstylist Sylvia Wheeler slicked her middle-parted brunette locks.

The shoot was to promote Ferreira's film debut as green-haired, Missouri 17-year-old Bailey Butler in the pro-choice friendship flick Unpregnant, which starts streaming September 10 on HBO Max.

In Emmy winner Rachel Lee Goldenberg's road trip buddy dramedy, Bailey helps drive her former BFF Veronica (Haley Lu Richardson) to an abortion clinic in New Mexico.

Abortion is technically legal in all 50 states - but Missouri imposes many restrictions like parental consent, mandatory counseling, and bans procedures on patients whose pregnancies have passed 'viability.'

The Mandalorian scene-stealer Giancarlo Esposito, The Kids Are Alright actress Mary McCormack, Clueless alum Breckin Meyer, and 13 Reasons Why star Alex MacNicoll also appear in the movie.

As for when the Queens-born, Jersey-raised star will reprise her role as teenage dominatrix Kat Hernandez, production on the second season of Euphoria has been on hold ever since the March 11th script reading.

'You can always create your own path,' Barbie told Marie Claire last week.

For me, and I think for a lot of people can relate to this, seeing someone that looks like you is very important on TV. But it can't be the thing that stops you if you don't see yourself in it. 

'Some people are like, "Well, I never see people like me doing this." Yeah, and someone has to change it. Don't get discouraged.'

Ferreira - a body positivity activist - also recently scored a gig as brand ambassador for Becca Cosmetics, and she originally got her start modeling for American Apparel.
