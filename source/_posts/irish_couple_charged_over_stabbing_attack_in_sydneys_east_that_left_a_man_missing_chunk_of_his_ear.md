A young Irish couple have been charged over the alleged stabbing of a man that left him stranded in a unit block hallway with a partially severed ear.

Neighbours found victim Oliver Solan, 30, barely conscious in a corridor at a Young Street apartment block in Randwick, in Sydney's east, about 8.40pm on Saturday.

Police allege 23-year-old Patrick Earle, from Kilkenny in Ireland, got into an argument with Mr Solan at the unit before he sent text messages to another group of men.

The men arrived and Earle's girlfriend, 26-year-old Katie Murtagh, originally from Dublin, let them in before going to hide in a bedroom, it is alleged. 

The glamorous girlfriend allegedly messaged his mates for backup just before the victim's ear was viciously severed in a horror stabbing.

When they arrived Mr Solan was allegedly stabbed multiple times and a part of his ear had been severed off in the fight.

Distressed neighbours called police, who found Mr Solan with multiple stab wounds to his head and body and a chunk of his ear missing.

Paramedics rushed the 30-year-old to St Vincent's Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and remains in a serious but stable condition. 

Daily Mail Australia can reveal Earle, Murtagh and Solan had been drinking together at an eastern suburbs pub earlier that night venue before returning to the couple's apartment. 

While there an argument between the two men ensued, with Solan allegedly the first to attack his friend causing injuries to Earle's arm.

It was then that Murtagh allegedly sent a Facebook message to Earle's friends asking them to come over, at which point she let them in to the unit and hid in her room as they attacked Solan with a knife, severing part of an ear.

The glamorous Irish couple were arrested shortly after but the four other men remain on the run with NSW Police now appealing for public assistance to track them down.

Police body cam footage shows the moment officers scoured the apartment block looking for the suspects. 

The clip showed blood splattered walls and him lying slumped in a corridor before he was taken out on a stretcher.

A crime scene was established and police found Earle at nearby Botany Street with an arm injury, 9News reported.

He was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital for treatment for his injury before he was charged with wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Murtagh was arrested at the unit a short time later and charged with aiding and abetting to wound a person. 

Appearing in court via video link, Earle sat quietly wearing a hospital gown and with a bandage over his left ear. 

The court was told he is facing a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted, with a standard non-parole period of seven years.  

Murtagh chose not to appear on screen in court and along with her boyfriend will be held in custody until October 27. 

During that time the lovers turned co-accused will not be able to talk.

Police allege that Murtagh was aware of what would happen when she invited and let her boyfriend's backup inside their apartment.

When her boyfriend and the four men fled, CCTV footage allegedly shows her using her strength to drag Solan's bloodied body into the hall.

Distressed neighbours called police, who found Mr Solan with multiple stab wounds to his head and body and a chunk of his ear missing.

Paramedics rushed the 30-year-old to St Vincent's Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and remains in a serious but stable condition.

As Mr Solan was being attended to by paramedics, police scoured the area hunting for Earle, Murtagh and the other alleged assailants.

Witness Ben Cary told 7News Earle had been chased down the street by police.

'I think he was just trying to get into upstairs, all these cops were chasing him down the street,' Mr Cary said.

Murtagh faced Waverley Local Court on Sunday where the court heard she thought the group of men arrived to the unit to have a chat.

But police allege Murtagh was completely aware of what the men planned to do when she let them inside. 

The court heard that she later dragged the barely conscious victim into the hallway before fleeing the scene.
