An adorable video shows two dogs sitting on lawn chairs appearing to have a chat as stunned motorists drive past. 

The brief clip shows the white Labrador and brown pitbull cross sitting up straight as they watch the world go by. 

An Australian car passenger leans out of the window to capture the bizarre encounter. 

He is heard saying: 'What are you two on? 

'I don't know who you are, and who you belong to but why are you sitting on chairs like that?' 

The man then turned his camera around and filmed the two dogs sitting peacefully together in a neighbour's yard.

'That scared the **** outta me,' he said. 

The video was shared to social media on Monday and has already been viewed more than 80,000 times.  

'Those dogs are up to something they have a plan to take over,' one user wrote. 

'Oooo both turned their head at the same time, creepy stuff,' another added.

'I don't know what's funnier, the dogs using the chairs or the owner placed them there just for them,' a third replied. 

The man said he had to turn around and get some video of the dogs (pictured) who looked unfazed when he pulled up to question them
