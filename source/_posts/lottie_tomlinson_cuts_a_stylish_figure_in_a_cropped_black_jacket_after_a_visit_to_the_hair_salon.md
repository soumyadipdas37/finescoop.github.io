Lottie's outing comes amid news that her brother Louis, 28, is 'concerned' after learning she gave her boyfriend Lewis Burton, 28, £22,000 to pay off his debts.

MailOnline revealed that Lewis and Lottie first started dating back in July, and it's now thought that Louis and his grandparents are 'worried' about the relationship.

The source said that Lottie paid boyfriend Lewis the lump sum in August, and has also foot the bill during expensive restaurant visits. 

A source said: 'Lottie paid off a debt for Lewis to the value of £22K in August, a month after they confirmed their relationship.

'Louis has since found out, as well as Lottie's grandparents who are worried.  

'Lottie's twin sisters Phoebe and Daisy told their grandparents it was Lottie who paid the bill when they ate together with Lewis at London restaurant The Ivy, which caused them to worry further.' 

It is understood that Louis has been in Los Angeles where his four-year-old son, Freddie, lives, throughout lockdown while Lottie resides in London.

MailOnline revealed Caroline Flack's ex-boyfriend was dating Lottie in July and the pair later confirmed their relationship by holidaying together in Ibiza. 

They have since been pictured passionately kissing, as well as sharing an animated exchange, which looked like an argument. 

Lewis started dating Lottie five months after Love Island host Caroline tragically took her own life aged 40. 

TV presenter Caroline was charged with common assault following an alleged attack on Lewis, which took place at her London home last December. 

In March last year, siblings Louis and Lottie lost their 18-year-old sister, Félicité, after she died from an accidental overdose.

Their mother Johannah also passed in 2016 from leukaemia at 43, with Lottie thanking her fans in July for being her 'extended family' and 'support mechanism.'

According to sources, Lottie and Lewis first connected over their grief, after the former model spoke on Instagram in March of being 'lost for words' and 'in so much pain' following Caroline's sudden death.

Since the end of lockdown Lewis has been on several holidays, including to Marbella twice with friends and a trip to Ibiza, which he enjoyed with girlfriend Lottie.
