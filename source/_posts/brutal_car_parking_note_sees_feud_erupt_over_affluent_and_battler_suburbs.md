A rude note left on a parked car has sparked a heated debate about snobby suburbs and whether it's appropriate to park on a front lawn. 

A homeowner from Claremont, an exclusive suburb in west Perth, has come under fire for leaving the 'very rude' and 'snobbish' message on a car parked on their lawn.  

The note triggered a social media firestorm for taking aim at Balga, a suburb 12kms north of Perth's CBD, when it was shared to social media on Monday.   

'This is not Balga. Park in the street, not on the lawn. Don't park here again,' the message read. 

A homeowner in Claremont, an affluent suburb in west Perth, left a 'discriminatory' note (pictured above) on a car that was parked on their front lawn 

The homeowner came under fire for the accusatory message and was labelled 'a freaking snob' (pictured) by social media commenters who read the note on Monday 

The 'antagonistic and discriminatory' note quickly caused commenters to label the message an act of 'total and utter snobbery'.   

'What a freaking snob! I've lived in Balga, Midland, Gosnells, Bassendean, Beechboro, Scarborough.

'All suburbs have their 'riff raff' and all have their so called 'pillars of society'.

 Do you think it's okay to park on the front lawn?

'Have they actually lived in Balga to make this comparison? I doubt it,' one user wrote.     

'The message displayed here is antagonistic and way out of line.'  

'Suburbs do not make people. Most people living in so-called affluent suburbs are rotten through and through,' another commenter said.  

Other users pointed out that cars parked on front lawns could damage sprinkler systems. 

'I too had that problem. I spoke and left messages on the person's windscreen because we had sprinklers.  

The Claremont homeowner (Claremont pictured) criticised the driver for parking on their verge and took aim at the northern suburb of Balga, 12kms north of Perth's CBD 

Social media users defended Balga (Balga pictured above) and criticised residents from 'so-called affluent suburbs' for being 'rotten' and 'antagonistic' 

'Most lawns have a sprinkler system in place and cars do cause breakage when they drive off,' one commenter said.      

Other users defended the note and condemned the driver for parking on the verge. 

'I would also be annoyed if someone parked on my lawn without permission.' 

'If that's what it takes to get people not to park on somebody else's lawn fair enough.' 

'I wouldn't leave a note. There would be spikes in their tyres,' one user wrote.  

The median price of a house in Balga is $298,250, in comparison to $1,448,890 in Claremont. 

All councils in Perth state 'to park on a verge you will need the permission of the owner of the premises adjacent to the verge.'  

A council spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia failure to obtain this permission could result in a visit from a parking ranger and a $100 fine. 

Commenters defended the driver and labelled the homeowner as 'arrogant'
