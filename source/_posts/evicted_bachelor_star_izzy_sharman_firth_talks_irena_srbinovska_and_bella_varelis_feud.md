Evicted Bachelor star Izzy Sharman-Firth has revealed some surprising new details about the ongoing feud between Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska.

The 29-year-old, who was sent home on Wednesday's episode, claimed that there's far more to the story than what viewers saw. 

In an interview with Pedestrian, the reality star claimed that Irena, 31, had told people Bella, 25, was only on the show to boost her social media presence.

'I had heard things about [Bella], I heard that she was strategic and just there for social media,' Izzy said. 

'But during lockdown, I started to realise that a lot of that stuff had come from Irena. So I started to question it.'  

She then went on to claim that Irena had said 'a lot of things' to Locky, and it 'caused issues' between him and Bella.

'There were a lot of things that were said to us and to Locky [about Bella] by Irena, and that got revealed during lockdown,' she said.   

'I think Irena is very good at saying subtle things in a way that doesn’t seem like an attack – that cast doubt in Locky’s mind about Bella’s intentions and it caused a lot of issues in their relationship,' she further added.

Bella and Irena's feud began shortly after the contestants returned to the Bachelor mansion after three and a half months of lockdown.

On-site production of The Bachelor had been suspended from mid-March until the first week of July, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

At the first post-lockdown cocktail party, a furious Bella accused Irena of lying about the extent of her contact with Locky during self-isolation and called her a 'manipulative little b***h'.

'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.

She later turned on the waterworks around the other women and accused Irena of trying to 'ruin' her relationship with Locky.

'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she said

The Bachelor concludes Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10.
