This is the amazing moment an octopus amazed a diver with its incredible colour-changing camouflage as it hid in plain view.

Footage was captured by a free-diver as he swam in the crystal clear waters in the French Riviera. 

As the diver swims through the water, he uses his hand to point to floor and what appears to be rocks and seaweed.

Heading down to the bottom, the diver swims through seaweed before focusing the camera on ragged mass of rock.

But the rock does not appear to be what it seems, as suddenly an octopus bursts off the rock and swims off into hiding, squirting ink as it flees.

The incredible octopus interchanged between its natural brown complexion and the deep-sea green of its surroundings.

It had settled on a spot and changed colour in order to blend seamlessly with the surrounding reef.

Octopuses are highly-intelligent beasts that have evolved to master their marine environment and are unique in the animal kingdom for many reasons - having three hearts, for example.

Camouflage is just one of their remarkable methods of self-preservation.

Octopuses are part of the family cephalapods, which includes squid and cuttlefish and many of these animals have chromataphores in their skin.

These special pigment cells allow them to control the colour of their skin, much like chameleons.

They can also change the texture of their skin to better blend in.

The diver said: 'During a freedive in the French Riviera, approaching gently around the Posidonia, the octopus uses his best camouflage. When he saw me he changed colors and disappeared.'
