High-rolling revellers piled out of exclusive private members' venue Mark's Club after 10pm last night - despite Boris Johnson's strict curfew.

Partygoers were photographed leaving the Mayfair joint - where membership reportedly costs in the region of £2,000 a year - after 10.25pm last night.

Few guests wore masks as they left and some were seen hugging and kissing on the pavement outside.

Witnesses slammed the scenes as 'one law for the rich and another for the poor' as people were seen at the club - dubbed a ‘haven of exclusivity’ - as late as 10.43pm.

Those wishing to join the Mark’s Club need the support of two existing members who propose and second the application.

The two other members must also provide letters of support to the candidate. 

These are handed in alongside application forms and a letter giving the reasons why the candidate wants to be a member of Mark's, according to its website. There’s also believed to be a one-off joining fee of £1,000.

On September 24, all businesses selling food or drink as well as social clubs and casinos - among others - must shut their doors at 10pm.

The club's safety guidance on its website currently states: 'In light of the government announcement on Tuesday, Mark’s Club now closes at 10pm, and members are required to wear masks when they are not seated at the table.'

The safety measures - which aim to make members 'feel as safe in your club as you do in your own home' - also include mandatory mask-wearing when leaving the club and regular antibody testing for employees.

There are also thermal imaging cameras in the club, as well as a germ-killing air filtration system.

The club has been popular with several senior Tories in the past.

David Cameron disclosed his membership at the club in the Commons Register of Interests after he was handed a free membership. 

It states: ‘On October 1, 2015, I accepted honorary membership of Mark’s Club, a private members’ club of 46 Charles St, London. (Registered October 21.)’

Mark's Club has been known to host swathes of celebrity clients, including Daisy Lowe (left) who was seen partying there on January 10, 2015, in London

Boris Johnson held a Christmas party there for supporters the year before that. 

The club's dress code says: ‘Ladies should be elegantly dressed’ with denim, T-shirts, cowboy boots and ‘exposed undergarments’ banned.

Men are ‘actively encouraged’ to wear a suit and must wear a ‘jacket and collared shirt at all times’. The club was opened in 1972 by entrepreneur Mark Birley.

The current owner, restaurateur Richard Caring, bought Birley’s string of clubs for £100 million in 2007. 

The club reopened after a multi- million-pound make-over by Paris-based designer Tino Zervudachi.

Mr Caring said the changes would ‘embrace Mark’s Club’s timeless tradition while evolving it to become a haven of exclusivity... reflective of today’s contemporary, global and sophisticated member.’ 

Mark's Club have been approached for comment.
