They met in 2018, but only went public with their romance on Thursday. 

And, Charles Dance, 73, cosied up to Alessandra Masi, 53, on Saturday, at a promotional event for their new film The Book Of Vision, during the 77th Venice Film Festival.

The actor wrapped an arm around his Italian film producer girlfriend - who was the unit production manager on the movie - as the couple posed for loved-up snaps while on the beach in front of the Hotel Excelsior.

Charles kept things casual in a grey short sleeved shirt which he left partially unbuttoned. 

Alessandra meanwhile nailed boho chic in a scarf print red halterneck, with her blonde tresses left to hang loose in soft waves.

The couple met in 2018 when he acted in art movie The Book Of Vision, while Alessandra was the unit production manager for the film. 

Since going public with their relationship, the pair have packed on the PDA with passionate kisses and hand-in-hand sunshine strolls.

Perhaps significantly, Alessandra has been hired to work on his next film The Inn At The Edge of the World.

The movie is an adaptation of the Alice Thomas Ellis book about an unrelated group who answer an advert and go to a remote Scottish island to escape Christmas.

The Game Of Thrones actor will direct as well as star in that film, alongside Joanna Lumley and Freddie Fox.   

A friend of his confirmed that he had recently mentioned a 'new Italian girlfriend', although there was no response from his agents on Thursday.

Alessandra, who comes from Bologna, has a degree in film from Bologna University and has been working in the movies for nearly three decades.

In an interview last year Dance – who plays Lord Mountbatten in The Crown – said the end of his marriage to Joanna Haythorn had been a matter of great sadness. 

'I regret that the marriage ended; it was largely my fault. But sensibly, we're now the best of friends,' he said.  

He told another interviewer that he had not been 'the greatest husband in the world' to Jo, whom he met when he was 19. 

Before their split was announced he was linked to actress Emilia Fox. Then came a relationship with actress Sophia Myles, 33 years his junior; they dated from 2003 to 2005.

Next he dated model Shambhala Marthe, 26 years his junior, whom he met in a fruit and veg market. 

She was succeeded in his affections by painter Eleanor Boorman, by whom he had a daughter, Rose, when he was 65. Miss Boorman is 25 years his junior and they split in 2012 soon after the baby arrived.

He told an interviewer in 2019 that he likes 'beautiful women' and added: 'I like independence, I like strong women, women who survive and thrive in what is still a male-dominated world in most professions. I think that description fits my ex-wife and my former fiancee, Eleanor.'
