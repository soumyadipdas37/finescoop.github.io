A former Bachelorette star has been charged with possessing cocaine after recently landing a role as a drug dealer in an Australian film. 

Jess Glasgow, a former councillor for Noosa in the Sunshine Coast faced the Noosa Magistrates Court on Tuesday after he was allegedly caught with the drug in July.

The 37-year-old was due to appear in court on September 1 but failed to show up and instead submitted a medical certificate.

Last week, Glasgow said the charges were a result of a 'miscommunication'.

The former reality star was pulled over by police on July 18 and taken to Noosa Police Station for a breath test,  The Courier Mail reported.

He was then allegedly found with cocaine and charged with possessing a dangerous drug. 

Glasgow's lawyer Patrick Meehan on Tuesday asked for the substance to be tested.  

'The charge in my submission a minor possession charge … I'd ask for a lengthy adjournment,' he said.

'The defendant doesn't know what the drug is, so we are asking for the drug to be analysed.'

Magistrate Chris Callaghan said the drug had been identified as cocaine and accepted the adjournment request.

Glasgow was booted from last year's Bachelorette after making inappropriate comments to Angie Kent

'You just need a shop front certificate, you don't need to know the quantity or the purity you just need to know the identity of the drug,' he said.  

Glasgow recently revealed he had been casted in a movie about the Gold Coast's drug underbelly - and that he would play a real estate agent and dealer.

He was booted from The Bachelorette after making inappropriate comments towards Angie Kent and several female producers last year. 

In October 2019, the mayor of Noosa, Tony Wellington, said in a statement: 'With his appearance on the reality TV show The Bachelorette, Councillor Jess Glasgow has revealed behaviour that is totally inappropriate for a Noosa councillor, indeed for any individual.' 

Mr Wellington went on to say that Jess brought the council's name into 'disrepute' and 'undermined' its the good reputation. 

During one episode on the season filmed last year the contestants were taking part in a farmyard themed photoshoot.

Glasgow was dressed as the backside of a horse when he 'joked' that Angie was going to 'ride' him.

He later positioned his head close to Angie's bottom and proceeded to poke his tongue out and make rude sexual gestures.

In another cringeworthy moment, he brazenly told her: 'Don't mind me if I get some wandering fingers, alright?'

A furios Kent eventually found out and sent him home.  

Glasgow will face court again on October 27.
