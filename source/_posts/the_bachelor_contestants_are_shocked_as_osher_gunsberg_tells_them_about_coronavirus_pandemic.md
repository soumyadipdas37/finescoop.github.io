A trailer for Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor offers a glimpse into the shocking moment the contestants are told about the intensifying coronavirus pandemic.

After a dramatic rose ceremony, Osher Gunsberg informs the remaining women The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

'You may remember before you came into the mansion, there was growing concern about coronavirus that was beginning to spread around the world,' Osher said.

He added: 'A lot has changed since you've been here in the mansion and The World Health Organisation has now declared a global pandemic.'

'The government is taking steps to curb the spread of the virus and to help save lives so things like pubs, clubs, restaurants, theatres and anywhere people may gather are closed and many people are working from home.'

As they processed the news, Osher explained: 'Some states have chosen to close their borders but thankfully here at the mansion you are quite safe from everything that is going on.'

'As always, your health and wellbeing is absolutely paramount to everybody making this show, and they will do what is needed to keep you safe while you're here.'

However, later in the episode Osher informed the contestants on-site production will be suspended and the women are forced to leave the mansion. 

The remaining contestants will continue to go on 'virtual dates' with leading man Locky during lockdown.

The wider narrative of the coronavirus pandemic will 'form part of the story' of The Bachelor's eighth season, according to Channel 10 bosses.

As a result of the interruption, Channel 10 has been forced to air shorter episodes of The Bachelor this season.

The network and producers Warner Bros. were left with a dearth of footage as a result of the lengthy filming break.
