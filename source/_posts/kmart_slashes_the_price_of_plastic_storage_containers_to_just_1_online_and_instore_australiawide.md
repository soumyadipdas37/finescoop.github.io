Kmart has reduced a range of storage containers and lunchboxes to just $1.

News of the discount was shared in Facebook budgeting group Markdown Addicts on Thursday, drawing hundreds of comments from delighted bargain hunters.

Shoppers have been rushing to stock up on the heavily discounted reusable plastic containers, which appear to be part of a flash clearance sale in stores across Australia and online.

Among the best deals are a pair of 400ml snap lid lunchboxes, a 1.7litre container and two 300ml mini-boxes, all for $1.

Kmart fans from all over the country confirmed the offers are available in their local stores, with customers sharing photos from Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia.
