Catherine is known for her illustrious career in French cinema, including the 1980 classic The Last Metro and Indochine in 1992, both of which earned her Cesar awards for Best Actress.

Her most recent on-screen appearance came in The Truth last year, which she starred in alongside Juliette Binoche, Ethan Hawke and Ludivine Sagnier. 

Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases.

Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.

There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30.  

Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital. 

The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.

The French government recently announced that it would be pumping €100billion (£91billion) into the economy as part of a recovery plan. 

Politician Macron hopes that this will help the French economy to get moving again by 2022. 

Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6.
