Dua Lipa teamed up with James Corden to give fans dating advice amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, via a New Rules parody track.

The 25-year-old singer made an appearance on the British TV personality's The Late Late Show, where they joined forces to belt out the catchy and hilarious song.

Initially singing along to the tune of Dua's hit song Don't Start Now, the pair prepare listeners for finally meeting a partner in person, after starting their romance online.

Donning a face mask to match her sparkling dress, Dua and fellow Brit James, 42, sing: 'Wear a mask / Wash your hands / It's not like you have other plans / It's awkward / But it's cool/ Following all these golden rules.'

The song then made a switch to an updated spin on Dua's chart-topping 2017 track New Rules, as the pair laid out regulations on how to reenter the dating world.

Lyrics included: 'There’s a new third base / It’s when you get to see their lower face / And if you hit it off / Watch out if they start to cough.'

Keeping with the theme of safety, the song continued: 'We’ve got new rules for dating / Safety is stimulating / It’s your neighbours you’re saving.' 

Ahead of appearing on the show, the star took to Instagram to share a snap of herself looking glam in a plunging shimmering gown as she posed up a storm.

Teaming her chainmail dress with a pair of black vertiginous suede heels and opaque tights, the London-born beauty displayed her flexibility as she stretched and posed.

The star, who recently returned from a break in Palm Springs, was seen performing alongside TV personality Corden in their special novel coronavirus safety song.

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK. 

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end. 

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic. 

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.
