Cheer star Monica Aldama was spotted this Friday arriving at the Dancing With The Stars studios in Los Angeles.

The 50-year-old, who rose to fame as the coach on the Netflix reality series, looked the image of bright spirits as she turned up to work. The star emphasized her trim figure in a fitted turtleneck advertising Navarro Cheer, the team she coaches on her own show.

Also seen heading to the studios were fellow DWTS contestants Carole Baskin, Chrishell Stause and Jesse Metcalfe. 

Stepping out: Cheer star Monica Aldama was spotted this Friday arriving at Dancing With The Stars studios in Los Angeles

She wore her blonde hair down and carried a print red back that bulged with her supplies as she arrived to dance.

Aldama made sure to wear a mask as she stepped out, and as the day heated up she took off the sweater to reveal a tank top.

She has been teamed up this season with pro dancer Val Chmerkovskiy, who was also spotted looking snappy as he headed into rehearsals.

 Baskin, the controversial CEO of Big Cat Rescue who achieved notoriety on the Netflix docu-series Tiger King, was also seen outside the studio.

She is another one of the celebrity contestants this season and has been teamed up with the professional dancer Pasha Pashkov.

Carole was determinedly on-brand when she was spotted this Friday, slipping into a flowing pair of tiger-print pants.

Her loose-fitted blouse had a colorful floral print but she still kept the animal theme going, as between the flowers was a zebra pattern.

The platinum blonde even wore a mask that had a tiger design on it as her means of protecting herself from the coronavirus.

Season 29 of Dancing With The Stars introduces host Tyra Banks who was hired to replace Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews.

The season premiered last week, and on this week's episode Charles Oakley became the first celebrity contestant to be eliminated with Carole being saved.

Aldama's latest sighting comes a week after she publicly shared her reaction to the child porn arrest of Cheer star Jerry Harris.

'My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I am devastated by this shocking, unexpected news,' she wrote.

'Our children must be protected from abuse and exploitation, and I'm praying hard for the victims and everyone affected. Please respect our privacy as our family mourns during this heartbreaking time.'

Harris, 21, was arrested by the FBI last Thursday in Chicago and charged with producing child pornography.

Federal court records say he stands accused of trying to get an underage boy 'to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself.'

Days before his arrest, 14-year-old cheerleader twin brothers accused Harris of soliciting explicit photos from them and asking one of them for oral sex.

Harris has denied the allegations against him.
