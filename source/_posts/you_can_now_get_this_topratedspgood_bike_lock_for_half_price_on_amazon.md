Designed with a canvas sleeve, it will not only stymie a hacksaw but will protect the chain from scratching your bike too. Win-win. 

The D-lock versus chain lock is a hotly debated topic, but many shoppers have commented on how the SPGOOD chain lock gives you more options of where to lock your bike, not to mention it's easier to transport. 

'This bike lock is so hassle free compared to my previous D-lock. No need to carry key as this is a combination lock and this is a five numbered combination secure lock. Compared to D-lock, this is flexible when coming to locking to no standard objects and very easy to carry.' 

SPGOOD bicycle lock uses a five-digit combination code, so you don't have to worry about losing your key 

While some of the reviews have stated that the SPGOOD is slightly heavier than some other locks, many added that this is reassuring. 

'This is the most sturdy bike lock I've ever seen. It's heavy but that's is because your bike is super safe. It collapses small so it's easy to carry with you on a bike ride but parking your bike up you know that it's completely safe. Can be used for other things but for the bike it gives me complete peace of mind. Simple to set up and super safe.'

The locks simplicity makes it a big winner with shoppers, with another writing: 'This a great bicycle chain, long enough to put it around my bike and very strong which is the reason why cutting is almost impossible. It's very convenient without having to use a key to lock it. It was easy to use or reset code and there are instructions on setting up the combination lock which was also helpful.' 

A third raved: 'Bought this as an easy to carry lock for stopping at the local shops etc. Long enough to fit round both wheels and frame, and a hoop etc. Fast to set 4 numbers and you're off, no faffing with a key etc. Exactly what I wanted.'
