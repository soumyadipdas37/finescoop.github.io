The Bachelor's Bella Varelis furiously denied claims she's as an 'aspiring actress' last week. 

But the 25-year-old is certainly no amateur when it comes to performing for the camera. 

This week, a TV advertisement for retail chain TK MAXX surfaced online, starring none other than Bella. 

Fancy that! A cringeworthy television commercial for TK MAXX starring The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has surfaced online - a week after the 25-year-old furiously denied claims she's as an 'aspiring actress' 

Aired in 2017, the cringeworthy ad sees a fresh-faced Bella dancing around a wooden clothing stand in a variety of different outfits. 

The ad begins with the brunette posing next to the clothing stand in slouchy pajamas while sipping from a coffee mug. 

Jubilant rock music plays as she dances behind the coat stand, before miraculously re-emerging on the other side in leggings and a white singlet.

The stop-motion style video sees Bella rapidly changing outfits in the blink of an eye.   

Bella was signed to Wink modelling agency at the time of starring in the commercial.    

It comes a week after the Instagram star publicly slammed claims she aspires to be an actress who dreams of moving to LA to further her career.

'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' Bella wrote on Instagram. 

Without naming names, she went on to claim that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.

'It's unfortunate that you and many other people have believed it but I can confirm -  my tears weren't acting, they were real,' she added.

Last month, talent manager Michael Beveridge claimed that Bella had once planned to move to Hollywood to pursue her dreams of stardom.

Speaking on the Friendship Rose podcast with comedian Rose Callaghan, Michael claimed: 'She said she was moving to Los Angeles. Bella wanted to be an actress, or wants to be an actress.'

He explained that Bella had been signed to an influencer management company that he used to run with his ex-girlfriend.

Real tears: 'It's unfortunate that you and many other people have believed it but I can confirm - my tears weren't acting, they were real,' she wrote 

'Bella was one of the very first girls that we got,' he said, adding that he was shocked and skeptical when he saw her in trailers for The Bachelor.

Michael claimed he'd spoken to his ex-girlfriend about Bella's appearance on the Channel 10 reality show and was given some surprising information.   

He claimed his ex had told him Bella was 'moving to Los Angeles' to pursue acting and modelling.

When the podcast host asked if Bella had any professional training, Michael replied: 'When you're hot, you don't have to!'

He also alleged that Bella had scrubbed her social media accounts of any reference to her acting career before making her debut on The Bachelor.

Michael went on to say that he secured Bella modelling work when he was managing her career, including a campaign for Koala mattresses.
