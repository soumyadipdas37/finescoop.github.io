She's long been known on the soap for her role as Mandy Richardson.

And Hollyoaks star Sarah Jayne Dunn was in high spirits as she celebrated her 39th birthday with a group of pals in Manchester on Saturday.

Sarah Jayne cut a stylish figure in a classy nude trench coat that covered up her celebration outfit as she headed out with her pals.

The soap star opted for a statement red lip and black kitten heels as she laughed along with co-star Carly, who played Steph Cunningham.

Sarah let her long blonde tresses hand loosely among her shoulders as she headed home after dinner at the eatery.

Sarah is mum to son Stanley, four, with her husband Jon Smith, who she married in May 2018 at The Holford Estate in Plumley, Cheshire. 

Sarah revealed last October that Stanley had been rushed to hospital and she was having an 'emotionally draining' week.

Alongside a picture of herself on set with Stephanie Waring, she wrote: 'I've had the most emotionally draining & stressful week of my life. I can't wait for my little man to be back to full health first & foremost.

'Then I can't wait to be back on set doing a job that I love & working with people that make me smile. Love ya @stephwaring Fingers crossed it won't be much longer before I'm back.'

Sarah chose not to disclose what illness her son had in the post, which she tagged as being at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

She and Jon welcomed their first child together in August 2016, and the actress has since embarked on an intense fitness journey.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline recently, the star revealed she was motivated to transform her physique after 'everything got bigger' during pregnancy and that she wanted to tone up in preparation for her wedding.
