YouTuber Nabela Noor is using her social media platform to help find a missing woman who made a tearful appearance in one of her viral videos a few years ago.  

Melida Sandoval, 36, from Montebello, California, has been reported missing by her family and was last seen leaving her home on September 1, nearly two years after she appeared on Nabela's show The Bright Fight. 

Nabela, 29, took to Twitter last Friday to retweet a message about Melida's disappearance, writing: 'I am at a loss for words. This beautiful soul, Melida is missing. I am thankful to know her and call her a friend. Please PLEASE RT & share. Her name is MELIDA SANDOVAL. PLEASE SHARE!'

Call to action: Nabela, 29, tweeted about Melida's disappearance and also shared footage of her on her show The Bright Fight on her Instagram and TikTok pages

The Bangladeshi-American beauty vlogger later shared footage of Melida on The Bright Fight on her Instagram and TikTok pages to try and help find her.   

In the episode, Nabela set up a talking mirror in the middle of Venice Pier and asked people about their relationship with their image. 

When Melida walked in front of it, she explained that she had a difficult day because someone at work had just called her 'fat' and 'ugly.' 

'I hope that when you look in the mirror you see the beautiful girl I see,' Nabela replied. 'If you had a mirror back home that could talk back to you, what would you want the mirror to tell you?' 

Getting the word out: Nabela, who called Melida a 'beautiful soul' in her tweets, asked her followers to share her message 

Candid: Melida was a part of Nabel's viral social experiment that was featured on her show The Bright Fight in 2018. Melida cried as she opened up about her struggles with self-confidence 

Heartwarming moment: Nabela hugged Melida as she cried and insisted that she was beautiful and needed to believe it 

 I am at a loss for words. This beautiful human, Melida who was a guest on my show a few years back is missing. Melida is the kindest, sweetest soul who radiates goodness and love. Please share this video. Please spread the word. Please help Melida’s family bring her home. 懶

'That I look pretty, that it doesn't matter what other people say,' Melida said as she began to cry. 

Nabela suggested she try looking in the mirror and telling herself that she is beautiful, but Melida was hesitant. 

'I could say it, but do I really mean it? Probably not,' she admitted. 

Nabela came out from behind the mirror to give her a big hug as she sobbed. The YouTuber stood by her new friend's side as she encouraged her to look in the mirror and say she is beautiful. 

When the beauty guru reposted the clip, she made a banner denoting that Melida is a missing person. She also included her age and last known whereabouts. Melida was last seen in Montibello on September 1, driving a 2017 Toyota RAV4.
