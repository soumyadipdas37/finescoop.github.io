Happy days: Ant Anstead, the husband of Flip or Flop star Christina, has finally reunited with his children in the UK after a long quarantine separation and shared photos of their reunion on Instagram

'HAPPY BIRTHDAY ARCHO!!!,' Ant exclaimed in his first post back on social media.

He was celebrating his son's 14th birthday and posted a collection of happy photos of his recent time with his two children. 

After a long separation, Ant laid out some 'stats' about his reunion with his family across the pond.  

'Miles from home to my big kids - 5,437 // Duration of an LA - UK flight - 11 hours 10 mins // Weeks in U.K. quarantine - 2 // Days in quarantine - 14 // hours in quarantine - 336 // Minutes in quarantine - 20,160 // Seconds in quarantine - 1,209,600!'

He's back! Ant's family reunion came just in time for his son's 14th birthday and his daughter's graduation

'Miles from home to my big kids - 5,437 // Duration of an LA - UK flight - 11 hours 10 mins // Weeks in U.K. quarantine - 2 // Days in quarantine - 14 // hours in quarantine - 336 // Minutes in quarantine - 20,160 // Seconds in quarantine - 1,209,600! Moments like this - PRICELESS (worth every single one of those seconds)'

Difficulties: Earlier in the pandemic, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children

Earlier in the pandemic, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.

The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between being with his kids.

However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family of six kids all together.

'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.

'Being there.... congratulations Ammo on your graduation!! You make this Daddo so so proud of you as you move into life's next adventure!' 

It seems he is making up for lost time now though. In the new photos, the trio snuggled in bed together, enjoyed outdoor time by a picturesque pond and dined on steak frites.

Plus his timing ended up being perfect because he was able to celebrate two big milestones for his kids. 

'Archo you have grown into such an amazing young man and I love you to my core,' Ant penned to his son for his birthday.

Adding: 'Being there.... congratulations Ammo on your graduation!! You make this Daddo so so proud of you as you move into life's next adventure!'
