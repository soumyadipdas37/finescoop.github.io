England manager Gareth Southgate has been given the green light to attend Premier League matches again.

Southgate and his coaches did not go to any top-flight games during last season’s Project Restart because of the restrictions brought in to combat the coronavirus pandemic — though the 50-year-old was able to go to the FA Cup semi-finals and final at Wembley.

However, Southgate has resumed personal scouting missions at Premier League matches as he ramps up his plans for next summer’s European Championship and the forthcoming Nations League matches.

The England manager did not attend any of the six opening-day matches on Saturday or Sunday, but got to Bramall Lane on Monday evening to watch Wolves beat Sheffield United 2-0.

Southgate’s assistant Steve Holland was present for Chelsea’s 3-1 win at Brighton in the day’s late kick-off.

Scouts are now permitted entry to Premier League games to watch any of their clubs’ next three opponents.
