For their beach day, Richie showcased her stellar figure in a hot pink floral print bikini that featured a triangle top and high legged bottoms.

Though it's unclear whether or not she is rekindling her romance with Jaden, Sofia is currently single following her split from ex Scott Disick, 37.

Sofia and Scott ended their three-year relationship in May, following the Talentless founder's brief stint at a Colorado rehab facility.

Two-months after their breakup, the pair reunited at a Fourth Of July party in Malibu.

But by mid-August, numerous outlets reported that Scott and Sofia decided to end their relationship for good. 

Instead of galavanting around town with Sofia, Scott has been spending tons of quality time with his ex Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and their three children, sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. 

Jaden also has a connection to the Kardashian clan due to the fact that he reportedly dated Kylie Jenner, 23, in 2013. Just months after his alleged split from Sofia.
