Carol Burnett and her third husband Brian Miller have been granted temporary guardianship of her teenage grandson Dylan.

Court documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and dated Tuesday showed that they have been appointed temporary guardians of 14-year-old Dylan through January 8, 2021, according to an article by People.

'The Court finds that sufficient evidence has been provided to grant the matter on calendar this date based upon the reading of the moving papers and consideration of all presented evidence,' court documents said.

'Temporary guardians have the authority to change Dylan's school and housing pending the next hearing date,' the court papers also said.

Burnett, 87, and Miller two weeks ago sought the court's approval to be appointed as the boy's temporary guardians as her daughter Erin Hamilton copes with substance abuse issues.

 Her petition claimed that 'The LAPD placed Erin on a 51/50 hold for suicidality and drug use [in July]'.

'Throughout her adult life, and since Dylan's birth, Erin has suffered from severe substance abuse and addiction issues. Dylan's living environment has long been unstable, unpredictable, and unhealthy for a child,' her petition added.

The 52-year-old singer, who was crowned Miss Golden Globe 1993, was released from Chino Hills Hospital on July 24.

Dylan's father Kurt West has been in rehab, and the boy's situation became so troubled the Department of Children and Family Services conducted investigations in 2018 and 2019.

The married couple of 18 years have financially supported Dylan his entire life including his boarding school, medical/dental insurance, and housing expenses.

The flame-haired funnywoman had two other daughters - Carrie and Jody - from her 21-year marriage to the late producer Joe Hamilton, which ended in 1984.

Carrie died, age 38, of pneumonia as a complication of lung and brain cancer in 2002 just three months before Hollywood Arms, the play she co-wrote based on Burnett's 1986 memoir One More Time premiered in Chicago.

'My daughter Carrie got into drugs. In that situation, don't be their best friend. When we got her into a third rehab, oh, she hated my guts!' the Toy Story 4 actress recalled to AARP on July 30.

Burnett recalled to AARP on July 30: 'My daughter Carrie got into drugs. In that situation, don't be their best friend.
