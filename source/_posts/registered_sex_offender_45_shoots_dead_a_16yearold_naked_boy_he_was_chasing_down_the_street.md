A registered sex offender from Pennsylvania has been charged with fatally shooting a 16-year-old boy who was seen running away from him naked on Saturday. 

Orlando Duarte, 45, is currently in the Dauphin County Jail on felony counts of criminal homicide and prohibited possession of a firearm stemming from the killing of Kyan King in Harrisburg. 

Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said witnesses told police before his death, King said that he had been raped and that his rapist was trying to kill him, reported Local 21 News.

King was found laying naked in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after being shot in the chest

The harrowing incident began unfolding at around 1pm near 18th and Forster streets in the usually quiet Allison Hill section of Harrisburg, where residents were shocked to see a naked teen running down the street, with an armed man in an orange shirt pursuing him on foot.

Witnesses reported that the suspect, later identified as Duarte, fired several shots at King, who was heard crying for help.

Tracy Burton, who called 911 to report the shooting, said she heard King repeatedly yelling, 'help me,' which was followed by the sound of gunfire, reported The Morning Call.

King was found laying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.

Duarte fled the scene but was captured by responding officers two blocks away after a brief chase.

He reportedly told investigators he thought King was 18 years old.

Sergeant Kyle Gautsch, with the Harrisburg Police Department, said Duarte and King knew each other.

'Our understanding, this wasn't just a happenstance incident where he was pulled off the street. We are under the impression and understanding that they did know each other. They were acquaintances,' Gautsch said during a press conference.

When police went to search Duarte's apartment on North 17th Street, they reportedly found a note written by King that read, 'If you're reading this I'm dead,' according to PennLive.com.

Police also found a pair of sandals, which they said were placed by the back door as if someone had run out of them.

King's family held a memorial in his honor just hours after his killing on Saturday 

Duarte had no legal right to own a firearm because he is a register sex offender in the Megan's Law database stemming from his 2012 conviction on charges of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a child, aggravated indecent assault of a child, aggravated indecent assault without consent, indecent assault of a person less than 13, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of minors.

Duarte has a prior criminal record that includes two sexual assault cases involving children

In that case, Duarte was found guilty of repeatedly sexually assaulting a girl under the age of nine.

He was released from prison in May 2018 after serving six years.

Duarte's criminal record also includes prior charges related to a 2007 sexual assault of a seven-year-old boy.

Duarte was sentenced to six to 23 months of confinement and probation after pleading no contest to multiple counts.

He is due back in court on September 28. If convicted as charged in connection to King's killing, he could face life in prison.

Meanwhile, the victim's family held a memorial in his honor on Saturday, remembering King as smart and sweet, with a loud laugh, reported ABC27.

'We all loved Ky Ky we love him a lot,' his older sister Nyairrea Jones said. 'My little brother. Everything about him. I miss it all.'
