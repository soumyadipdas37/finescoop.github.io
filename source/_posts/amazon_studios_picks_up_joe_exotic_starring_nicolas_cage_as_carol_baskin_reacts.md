Real Joe: Cage, 56, was attached to star in the series back in May, when the project was set by by CBS TV Studios and Imagine TV, but now Amazon Studios is developing the series, according to Variety 

The Amazon Studios series is based on the Texas Monthly article 'Joe Exotic: A Dark Journey Into the World of a Man Gone Wild,' by Leif Reigstad. 

The story centers around Joe Shreibvogel (Cage), a.k.a. Joe Exotic, an outlandish exotic zookeeper in Oklahoma who is trying to keep his park alive. 

The show will explore how Shreibvogel transformed himself into Joe Exotic, and how he became lost within his own creation.

Dan Lagana (American Vandal) will serve as the writer, showrunner and executive producer of the series, under his overall deal with CBS TV Studios. 

No other casting for the series has been announced quite yet, though Carol Baskin herself did respond to Cage's casting in a new interview with Extra, and it wasn't positive.

'He is such a favorite actor of mine, and I just don’t know if I can even watch him after seeing that role,' she said.

While it isn't clear who will play Baskin in the Amazon series, NBCUniversal's upcoming show Kate McKinnon will seemingly focus on Baskin instead of Joe Exotic.

The show will be based on the second season of the Wondery Podcast about Joe Exotic, following Baskin first learning about Joe Exotic's park and her efforts to shut him down.

The show's description reveals that 'Carol has a checkered past of her own and when the claws come out, Joe will stop at nothing to expose what he sees as her hypocrisy.'

Joe Exotic is currently serving a 22-year prison on 17 federal charges of animal abuse and two charges of murder-for-hire, for hiring a hitman to kill Baskin. 

The Joe Exotic role will mark the first TV role ever in Cage's illustrious career, with the actor also set to executive produce through his Saturn Films company. 

Cage will next be seen on the big screen in Jiu Jitsu alongside Frank Grillo, Tony Jaa, Rick Yune and Marie Avgeropoulos.
