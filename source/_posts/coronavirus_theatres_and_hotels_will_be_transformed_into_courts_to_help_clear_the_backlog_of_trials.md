A theatre and two hotels will be transformed into makeshift courts to help clear the backlog of cases exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Lowry theatre in Salford, the Hilton Hotel in York and Jurys Inn in Middlesbrough are the latest buildings to become 'Nightingale courts', opening on September 28, the Ministry of Justice said. 

A further five of the temporary courts are earmarked for Chester, Liverpool, Bristol, Winchester and Cirencester and could open next month – but sites are yet to be confirmed.

It came as Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill QC warned delays in cases coming to court are 'corrosive' as they force victims to wait for justice.

He said more remote hearings could be part of the solution – as it emerged some courts are listing trials for 2023.

Courts in England and Wales are grappling with a waiting list of around half a million cases after closures during lockdown added to existing delays.

The Lowry arts centre in Greater Manchester will have four court rooms hearing criminal cases where defendants are not being held in custody, while the Middlesbrough hotel will deal with both civil and family cases. 

The hotel in York will also hear family cases.

It brings the total number of Nightingale courts to 17, providing 32 court rooms, the MoJ said, with the existing sites operating at 80 per cent capacity, which is higher than the average court prior to the pandemic.

Justice Secretary Robert Buckland hailed the 'important step' in the recovery plan but added: 'We must keep going if we are to get our courts back up to speed.'

Magistrates' courts are now dealing with some 21,000 cases a week while crown courts are clearing more than 1,700 cases at the same time and holding more than 100 jury trials.

Since the beginning of August, an extra 1,000 cases have been heard with extended sittings on Saturdays. 

Liverpool, Hull, Stafford and Snaresbrook crown courts are testing out longer sitting hours, with more expected to follow.

Plastic screens are being installed in 300 court rooms and rooms used for jury deliberations, allowing 250 crown courts to reopen for trials, which the MoJ said is more than were operating before the pandemic.

The Government has also pledged to install more technology to allow extra remote hearings to take place.
