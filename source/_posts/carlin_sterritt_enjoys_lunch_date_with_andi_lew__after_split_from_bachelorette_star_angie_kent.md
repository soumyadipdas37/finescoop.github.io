Carlin Sterritt split from Angie Kent, who he met on The Bachelorette, after 10 months of dating, in July. 

And while earlier this week he professed he was still single in a Facebook post, the former reality star does seem to have found some friendly female company.

On Friday, the 32-year-old was out for a lunch date in Bondi alongside wellness expert Andi Lew, 46.

The pair looked friendly and relaxed as they left a local establishment and strolled down the street together. 

In Instagram Stories shared by Andi on Friday, the fitness queen explained the meet up was for creative purposes. 

'Carlin was helping me shoot something actually. And I'm very grateful, he's so creative,' she said.

She then explained they'd cut their walk short because it had begun raining and she didn't want her hair to 'go curly'.  

'Does your hair go curly?' she asked Carlin, who replied that it was 'always curly'. 

'It's perfect now!' Andi told him enthusiastically, and Carlin bashfully played down the compliment, saying he used a lot of product keeping it straight. 

Andi showed off her stunning figure in a fitted, one-shoulder top under which she appeared to go braless.

Earlier this week, Carlin shared an old Facebook post from 2017 where he mused about what it would be like to find The One. 

Underneath the lengthy post, Carlin answered his former self by asking: 'OK 2017 Carlin... but I'm still single,' alongside the shrugging emoji.  

In July Angie revealed that she and Carlin had called it quits after 10 months of dating.

She revealed that they parted ways because their 'values didn't align'.

Andi, who last year said that she had been single for six years, was last linked to Love Island star Eden Dally in November. 

The pair were spotted together at the Maxim Hot 100 party sparking talk of a possible date.

However, Andi rubbished claims the pair are together saying they are 'only friends' after meeting at Mr World 2019.

Eden is currently dating  Cyrell Paule, and the pair share a son together, Boston, who they welcomed in February 2020.
