Genoa have completed the loan signings of Davide Zappacosta from Chelsea and Marko Pjaca from Juventus, 

The 28-year-old has fallen out of favour in west London and the club are actively attempting to ship him out again in the current window. 

Zappacosta represented the Bergamo outfit between 2011 and 2015 before moving to Torino - and it was from there that he completed his swoop to Chelsea.

The full-back has struggled with limited playing time and has also been rocked by a host of injuries.

Chelsea are believed to be keen to be seeking a permanent solution for Zappacosta, whose current deal runs down in 2022, during the current market.

His torn anterior cruciate ligament injury last October while on loan at Roma prevented him from being able to impress, and just seven top flight appearances then followed. 

Zappacosta's loan had initially been until January, but both parties agreed an extension until the end of the elongated season.

And it appears increasingly unlikely there is any way back for the Italian at Stamford Bridge. 

Frank Lampard has overhauled his team with a sensational spending spree this summer, although both captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Reece James will remain his first choices on the right side of defence. 

Like Zappacosta, Pjaca has been on a series of loan moves and saw his career stalled by injuries.

The 25-year-old was purchased by Juventus from Dinamo Zagreb for €23m in 2016, but went on loans to Schalke 04, Fiorentina and most recently RSC Anderlecht.
