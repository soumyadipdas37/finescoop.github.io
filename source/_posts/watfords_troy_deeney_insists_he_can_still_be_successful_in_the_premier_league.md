Troy Deeney believes he has unfinished business in the Premier League, with the 32-year-old insisting he still has the quality to lead a top-flight attack. 

The Watford striker sunk into the Championship after the Hornets' race to survive was only confirmed as unsuccessful on the final day. 

Deeney's season was rocked by a knee injury, with the forward ruled-out for a 10-game run which saw Watford go winless and sink to the foot of the table. 

Troy Deeney is convinced he can still be a Premier League striker in the future after relegation

The Englishman still managed 10 goals from 27 appearances for the Hornets, and believes the tally proves his quality.  

'I definitely still see myself as a Premier League striker,' Deeney told the Sun. 

'I scored double figures last season on one leg. Now I'm over my knee troubles. I'm back on two legs.

'I got ten in the league from 27 games, which was not a bad return. I know it includes penalties but Bruno Fernandes scores penalties as well at Man United. 

'How many did Sebastien Haller get last year for West Ham? Six or seven. Or Joelinton for Newcastle? Two.

'My character is "Get up and keep fighting", unless I've been nailed to the ground.'  

The forward scored four goals in Watford's last four games but it proved not enough for them 

Deeney's fighting spirit was evident in Watford's survival chase, scoring four goals in their last four games to inject hope into their push. 

The Hornets legend will be a crucial influence at Vicarage Road as the look to bounce straight back into the top-flight.
