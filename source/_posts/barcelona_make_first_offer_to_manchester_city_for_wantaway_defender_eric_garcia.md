Barcelona have made a bid of eight million euros (£7.2m) to sign Manchester City defender Eric Garcia, according to reports in Spain. 

SPORT claim the Premier League club value the 19-year-old centre-back at 40 million euros (£36.2m) but would be willing to lower their asking price significanty, with the player's current deal set to expire in June 2021.

New Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman is keen to bring the Spaniard, who graduated through the club's famous La Masia academy, back to the club. 

Eric Garcia has reportedly been subject of an offer from  Barcelona worth eight million euros

However, Garcia has said he is 'focused on next season with City' which appears to rule out an imminent switch to Barcelona. 

'It is true I have told the club I do not intend to extend my contract beyond 2021,' Garcia told Marca.

'But I will return to Manchester when I am finished on international duty with Spain, and I am focused on next season with City.'

Ronald Koeman is looking to overhaul Barcelona but could be frustrated in a deal for Garcia

The 19-year-old has had to remain patient under Pep Guardiola but has impressed when partnering Aymeric Laporte in the centre of the City defence. 

He started the Champions League quarter-final defeat to Lyon and the club appear to retain hope that they can convince Garcia into a U-turn on a new deal.  

Garcia featured 22 times in all competitions for City during the 2019-20 season and the Citizens lost just two out of the 13 matches in which he featured in defence

Koeman is planning a youth overhaul of the Barcelona squad he has inherited with Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal pushed to the exit and Ivan Rakitic already sent back to his former club Sevilla.
