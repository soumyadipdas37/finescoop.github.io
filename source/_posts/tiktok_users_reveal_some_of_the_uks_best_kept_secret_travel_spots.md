After months trapped inside due to the coronavirus lockdown, many of us have been making the most of long summer days by exploring parts of the UK we haven't discovered before. 

With this in mind, TikTok users from up and down the country have shared their favourite under-the-radar spots including hidden locations from Scotland, Wales, Essex and London. 

The hidden gems include the real Diagon Alley from Harry Potter in central London, a roller coaster in the middle of a Wales forest, and a stunning lavender field in Kent. 

Here, FEMAIL reveals the top secret travel spots social media users have managed to find tucked away in the UK.

TikTok users from up and down the country have shared their favourite under-the-radar spots including hidden locations from Scotland, Wales, Essex and London, including a shopping street they have dubbed the 'real' Diagon Alley  

While JK Rowling has said she had many inspirations for Harry Potter's cobble stoned wizarding shopping area Diagon Alley, one of them can be found tucked away in Covent Garden. 

In the children's books, the entrance to London's Diagon Alley sits on Charing Cross Road.

Fans looking to uncover the hidden entrance in the area will be enchanted to find a quaint row of bookshops on the edge of Charing Cross Road and St Martin's Lane.

The road, called Cecil Court, is full of Victorian-style second hand bookshops and has been known as the new Booksellers' Row since the 1930s. 

The street is accessible 24-hours a day and it's closest tube stop is Leicester Square Station. 

Forest roller coaster - Wales

Meanwhile in another clip which has gone viral on the social media site, a user encouraged others to explore a treetop roller coaster in North Wales

Nestled in the North Wales Conwy Valley, close to the iconic Snowdonia village of Betws y Coed, visitors can find a stunning treetop roller coaster. 

The Fforest Coaster at Zip world is the UK’s only alpine coaster of its kind and tickets for the ride start at £20.00 and entitle you to three rides. 

The rollercoaster takes brave visitors 365m up before plunging down 710m and travels up to 25mph.

Those who can muster up enough courage to ride the alpine coaster can expect to spend around six minutes on the ride. 

In order to avoid disappointment on arrival, Zip World recommends booking the rollercoaster in advance.

London Secret Garden ¿¿ ##tiktoktravel ##walk ##uk ##london ##londonlife ##plants ##church ##instagrammable ##hiddengems ##secretlondon ##beautiful ##viral ##fyp

St Dunstan-in-the-East was a parish church on St Dunstan's Hill, halfway between London Bridge and the Tower of London and is now a public garden 

St Dunstan-in-the-East was a parish church named after St Dunstan, who was a tenth century monk who became a popular saint in England.

The church, which is located on St Dustan's Hill, between London Bridge and the Tower of London, became badly damaged by the Great Fire of London and then largely destroyed in the Second World war.

In 1967 the City of London turned the stunning ruins into a public park, with visitors able to stroll through the green space between 8am to 7pm on weekdays.

The garden and ruins can even be hired for parties and wedding receptions. 

Little Provence - Kent 

Check out my latest IG post for the location of the Lavender Farm ¿¿ ##thisislondon ##lavenderfield ##secretlondon ##ukphotography ##exploremore

Visitors seeking a little flower power can find the striking fields of purple at Kent's Castle Farm, which  is just outside London 

Adventurous Londoners may think they can only access sweeping fields of lavender in the south of France but thanks to a farm just outside the city, they can actually find the areas a lot closer to home. 

Visitors seeking a little flower power can find the striking fields of purple at Kent's Castle Farm. 

Just outside Sevenoaks, visitors can find an idyllic summer day out, with purple lavender covering the fields from late June until the end of July. 

Castle Farm is the largest lavender farm in the UK and is owned by farmers William and Caroline Alexander. 

Tours usually run until the end of July, so sadly you'll have to wait until next year to enjoy this stunning location.
