On Monday, Brie was still relishing all the baby bliss as she posted a series of selfies to Instagram of her with her son .

Her long brown locks were gently curled as she made eye contact with the camera, wearing a touch of rose lipstick on her pretty pout as she angled her face in the up-close shots.

Brie shared the origin of her son's unconventional name with her 7.8M instagram followers.  

Buddy is 'named after Bryan’s Dad and his middle name is pronounced Desert after my Nana’s maiden name.

'He came into our lives in such a special way we wanted to name him after some special people,' the WWE beauty wrote.

Though being a new mom can be daunting Brie shared with her followers that she had been really enjoying her uninterrupted time with her family and new baby. 

'Cozied up to pillows, blankets, breast milk and infant snuggles. I'm really enjoying maternity leave' she shared a few weeks back. 

Buddy is now the youngest in their family of four, as Brie and Bryan have a three-year- old daughter Birdie Joe. The WWE pair started dating after meeting in the ring in 2010, but what started off as a wrestling storyline eventually evolved into a lasting relationship.

Self-care: 'After giving birth it’s essential to take care of yourself so you can take care of the new love in your life too' the Total Bellas star wrote as she talked about bouncing back after a C-section

Like most new mothers, Brie is also trying to fit in some time for herself after welcoming a newborn via C-section. 

'After giving birth it’s essential to take care of yourself so you can take care of the new love in your life too' she wrote on social media. The beauty credits full maternity lines like Frida mom with helping her to be 'postpartum prepared'.

Though parenthood can be stressful, it is surely comforting for both Brie and her sister Nikki to know that they are going through this journey together. 

Nikki Bella who is a first time mother welcomed her son Mateo with her professional dancer fiance Artem Chigvintsev, 37 on July 31.
