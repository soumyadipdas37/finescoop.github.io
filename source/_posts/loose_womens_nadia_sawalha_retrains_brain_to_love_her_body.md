She has divulged her biggest insecurities and body hang-ups on Loose Women. 

Yet Nadia Sawalha has now revealed she has learned to tell any niggling doubts in her head to 'shut up', as she admitted on Friday that she has 'retrained' her brain to love her body.

The Loose Women panellist, 55, has recently been uploading a slew of candid, unedited snaps in her underwear as she embraces all her 'flaws' and encourages others to do the same.

During an interview with The Sun, the mother-of-two revealed that others assume she is self-confident, but it doesn't come naturally to her.

She said to the publication: 'Every single day I have to tell myself to be confident. I have to tell the nasty voices in my head saying things about my fat rolls to "shut the f**k up".

'But it's about reminding myself every day to be kinder to myself - not even just other people, it's about being kinder to myself.

'I've been doing this s*** for a long time now, it's about retraining my brain.' 

In August, Nadia Sawalha shared a throwback bikini pic from 20 years ago and admitted her body insecurities have plagued her in the past. 

The TV star posted on Instagram the snap of her on the beach alongside her Loose Women pal Kaye Adams, as she recalled feeling so 'hideous' that she wanted to burst into tears.  

In a lengthy caption, Nadia said: '@the_mcgiff just sent this pic she took twenty years ago to me and @kayeadamsofficial.

'Saying..."Just had to send this to you two because it so perfectly sums up the old Nadia......look at the horror on your face because I was taking a photo of you!!!" 

'And my god she's right.'

She continued: 'I can actually remember the moment Carol took the photo . I almost wanted to cry because I thought I was so "hideous" a word I used all the time to describe myself back then... look at me trying to cover my body ??

'It leaves me feeling so sad when I look back and think about how much of that holiday I wasted with "stinking thinking" feeling "ugly" comparing my figure constantly to Kaye Adams and Carol's gorgeous bodies.

'What a b****y waste of time. What a sacrilege.'
