Meanwhile, his fiancé appeared to be staying home with their newborn daughter, Daisy, who they welcomed in late August. 

Earlier this week, the family were able to breathe a sigh of relief after Perry obtained an protection order, which extended to her little girl, Bloom and his nine-year-old son Flynn, who he shares with ex-wife, Miranda Kerr. 

The 13-time Grammy winner's restraining order is against her alleged stalker William Terry, who is believed to be homeless and living in a silver Buick sedan.

According to court documents filed by Perry and obtained by The Blast, he's made 'death threats on social media,' including that he wanted to 'snap Orlando Bloom’s neck,' and he has even attempted to enter their home on a few occasions. 

She detailed the last instance, which took place September 8: 'Terry jumped the fence of my home in the Beverly Hills area of Los Angeles. 

'Security ordered Terry to leave. When he refused he was placed under citizen’s arrest and then formally arrested for criminal trespass by the Los Aneles Police Department.'

Another hearing is set for October 8 to make the restraining order permanent. 

It should come as a relief to the parents, as they soak up time with their first child together.

The humanitarian agency released a statement on behalf of the parents: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter.   

'But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.'

The statement was posted to Unicef's Instagram, as well as Orlando and Katy's, accompanied with a sweet black-and-white photo of Daisy's hand holding mom and dad's fingers.

They used the opportunity to encourage donations to Unicef, adding: 'In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. 

'By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your [heart emoji] can bloom with generosity.'
