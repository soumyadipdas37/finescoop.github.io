A young woman viciously assaulted her father and threw eggs at her bedroom wall because her phone didn't charge and she saw him using her coffee mug. 

Rhiannon Stephenson was staying with her dad in Campbelltown, south-west Sydney, when she flew into a fit of rage in October, 2019. 

The 21-year-old, who had nowhere else to stay at the time, woke to find her phone had failed to charge overnight and her father was drinking from her mug. 

The Campbelltown Local Court heard Stephenson shouted 'that's my cup' before smashing it and storming into her room, where she began hurling eggs.  

When her father tried to intervene she punched him three times in the face, the court heard.

Her father said he felt 'immediate pain' after the assault and reported the incident to police. 

Magistrate George Breton said Stephenson had displayed a 'violent streak' which she needed to address. 

He told the 21-year-old she needs to learn to control her anger when she 'sees red', The Daily Telegraph reported.  

Stephenson is now five months pregnant and living with her mother on the NSW south coast where she said she is 'trying to rebuild' her life. 

Magistrate Breton gave the young woman a mental health direction and placed her on an 18-month Intensive Community Corrections Order.
