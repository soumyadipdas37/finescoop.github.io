Jason Isaacs shared a heartfelt tribute to his on-screen son Tom Felton to mark his 33rd birthday.

The actor, 57, took to Twitter on Tuesday to post a throwback snap alongside the Draco Malfoy star, as he gushed that Tom was 'always a ray of light to me.'

Gushing about Tom, Jason wrote: 'Holy hairy heroes son - you’re Jesus’s age today! In these strangest of dark days you’re always a ray of light to me.

'Thanks for making mischief, music and magic for this fan (and all the others too). Happiest of Birthday Bonanzas Love ya kid Fake Dad x'

Tom was delighted by the message from Jason, who played Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise, and wrote back: 'Love you dad x' 

Draco and Lucius shared a strained relationship throughout the franchise as the teen felt conflicted over his loyalty to Voldermort and the Death Eaters, but it's clear that the actors share a close friendship.

In July, Tom reunited with Jason and his onscreen mother Helen McCrory to read Chapter 14 of Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone.

The trio were the latest stars to read chapters of the first book from J. K. Rowling's wizarding franchise, with celebrities including David Beckham, Daniel Radcliffe and Eddie Redmayne reading earlier segments.

He said: 'Hello my name is Emma Watson, I play Hagrid in the Harry Potter films and I'm here to read Chapter 14 of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or Philosopher's Stone depending on where you are.'

Tom then teased the arrival of his on-screen parents: 'I've also been assured I get the backing of dad and mum', with Jason, who starred as the Malfoy patriarch for six of the eight movies, coming on: 'Hi, I'm Jason Isaacs'.
