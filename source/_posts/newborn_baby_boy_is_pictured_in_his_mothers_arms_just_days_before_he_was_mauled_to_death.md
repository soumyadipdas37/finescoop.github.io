An innocent baby boy 'mauled to death' by his family's cross-breed dog was pictured in his mother's arms just days earlier in a heartbreaking picture.

Tiny baby Elon was attacked on Sunday in Doncaster and could not be saved despite medics' best efforts.

His mother Abigail Ellis, 27, and her finance Stephen Joyner, 35, were arrested by officers probing the newborn's death on Sunday.

They were detained on suspicion gross negligence manslaughter and have been bailed pending further inquires.

Samantha Foulds, who claims to be a close friend of the pair, posted to Facebook: 'I know these people well and I tell you it's nothing more than a tragedy.

'You have no idea what that family have gone through.

'RIP little one, my love to you both and little ones at this heart wrenching time.' 

The baby was rushed to hospital with serious injuries after the attack in the village of Woodlands on Sunday - but he tragically died a short time later.

Sally Hooley, who saw the dog being taken away by police, said, according to The Mirror: 'The dog was a big fluffy golden dog, it looked harmless at first glance. I couldn't tell you the breed but three police officers were struggling to control it to get it into the dog van.

'The dog was strong enough to be dragging three officers into the road. It's so, so sad.'

'It looked like a big fluffy harmless dog. At the end of the day the parents will never get over the loss of their child.'

It has also been revealed that the baby's 'brilliant' mother lost her partner - and father of her three children - to sepsis a year and a half ago.

A neighbour told The Sun: 'She was a brilliant mum but her whole life fell apart when he died.

'She lost everything.' 

South Yorkshire Police rushed to a property in Woodlands at 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon following reports that a child had been attacked.

The baby was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary with serious injuries after being bitten by the dog but died a short time later.  

Both parents have been bailed pending further inquires.

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said police were called to an address around 3.30pm on Sunday following reports that a dog had attacked a child.

'On arrival at the property, emergency services discovered a 12-day-old baby boy had been bitten by a dog and suffered serious injuries.

'The child was taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.

Floral tributes have also been left outside the Doncaster property where the child was bitten

'A 35-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. They have now been bailed while enquiries continue.'

The dog has been removed from the address, the force added. 

Floral tributes have also been left outside the Doncaster property where the child was bitten.

A neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I saw at least three police cars turn up, there was just lots of commotion, and more turned up.

'Then someone came for the dog in a van and I saw forensic officers taking pictures of the scene.

'That was when I knew it was serious.'

The neighbour said that they didn't know the breed of the dog but that it was 'very big' and 'not something you'd want around small children'.

They also said that the dog had a habit of running into other people's gardens.
