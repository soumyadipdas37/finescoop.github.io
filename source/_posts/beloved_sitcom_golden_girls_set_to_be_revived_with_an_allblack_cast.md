The Golden Girls is being revived with an all-black cast, which includes Regina King and Tracee Ellis Ross.

One black follower said they didn't see the point in changing the race of the original. characters.  

'As much as I would love to see y'all make magic together, it would be nice to see an original piece of work and leave this classic alone. I would never want to see white counterparts redo your original work or anyone for that matter. I love y'all too much not to support but I'm just saying... ' they wrote.
