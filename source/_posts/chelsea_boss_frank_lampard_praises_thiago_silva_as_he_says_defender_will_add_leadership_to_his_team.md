Frank Lampard has hailed Thiago Silva's leadership qualities after the experienced defender joined Chelsea on a free transfer. 

The former Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil captain sealed his move to Stamford Bridge this week on a one-year deal with an option for a second.

Silva, 35, will add some much-needed experience to Lampard's side going into the new campaign.

Lampard told Chelsea's official website: 'We have a relatively young squad, we saw that last year, there were games afterwards when I was probably asking for more voice and some more leadership in different ways and he brings that naturally straightaway.'

Silva enjoyed a huge amount of success during his time at PSG, winning the league title seven times and the Coupe de France five times.

Having played more than 600 club games during his career in addition to making 89 appearances for Brazil, he should quickly become a key figure in the Chelsea dressing room.

Despite being in the latter stages of his career, Silva could help Chelsea to push on further this campaign.

Chelsea have been incredibly active in the transfer market, also bringing in Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Malang Sarr, with further arrivals expected to follow. 

Chelsea were in pre-season action on Saturday, with Werner scoring in a 1-1 draw away to Brighton.
