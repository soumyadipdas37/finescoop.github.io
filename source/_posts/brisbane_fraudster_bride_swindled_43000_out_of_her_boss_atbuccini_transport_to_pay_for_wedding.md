A desperate bride stole more than $43,000 from her boss by cashing in on benefits she wasn't entitled to so she could pay for her dream wedding. 

Courtney Beaumont Bell, 27, worked as a payroll officer at Buccini Transport for four years when she swindled $43,375 for her $60,000 wedding.

The woman, from Caboolture, 50km north of Brisbane, fleeced the company out of the money by cashing in on 200 days of leave, falsely claiming tolls and taking superannuation between June 2017 and July 2018, Quest Newspapers reported.  

Bell pleaded guilty to fraud in Brisbane District Court on Thursday where she handed her former boss, Paul Buccini, a cheque with all the money she had taken.

Judge Vicki Loury QC sentenced Bell to three years in prison but the 27-year-old will be released in six months.  

She said: 'Your motivation therefore was not as a result of any need, but rather greed on your part.'

Sarah Dennis, the prosecutor, claimed the fraud was calculated and Bell took advantage of her trusted position. 

David Crews, Bell's lawyer, said his client's offending was 'situational' due to the financial burden of her wedding.

He said Bell and her husband tried to pay for the wedding themselves and didn't want to ask their parents for help.

Mr Buccini said outside of court he was hurt when he discovered the fraud that had put financial stress upon his family and business.

He said it 'destroyed' him to discover someone he trusted took advantage of him.

He said he was glad justice had been served.
