Coles has launched a limited-edition range of apple pie flavoured chips in supermarkets across Australia.

The dessert-inspired snacks, believed to have hit shelves in late August, are now available in-store and online for $3 per 200 gram bag.

A photo of the chips - said to taste like sweet and salty popcorn - has gone viral since it was shared in a bargain hunting group on Facebook, amassing thousands of comments which reveal foodies are divided over the unusual flavour.

Shoppers have spotted limited edition apple pie flavoured chips on the shelves at Coles, which cost $3 per 200g bag

'These are so nice! Dip it (sic) in caramel sauce and would be so delicious,' one woman said. 

'Killing two birds with one stone, snack and dessert,' said another.

A third tagged her friend and said: 'Could be interesting - we need to try these.'

Mamamia executive editor Leigh Campbell weighed in on the debate on Instagram, writing: 'I had the funniest and wittiest caption for how bad these were gonna suck….then I tried the chips. These don't suck. They are actually okay.'

Ms Campbell went on to compare the taste to 'sweet and salty popcorn' and said she 'semi-enjoyed' eating the chips, before rating them a below par 4 out of 10.

Others were more scathing in their critique, with many leaving comments like 'what is this madness?', 'it's a no from me' and 'Coles should have stopped at anchovy spread'.

'Two of my favourite things, but not sure about them together,' said one woman.

Another said the flavour 'didn't sound appealing'. 

And it's not the only new addition to Coles' own-brand chip range.

The supermarket giant has also released a limited-edition pack of chicken nugget flavoured chips which have already proved a hit on social media.

'I tried them yesterday and they taste a bit like Kettle's Honey Soy chip,' one person said.

'This is heaven in a bag! I need to stock up on these for birthday and Christmas presents,' said a second.

A third added: 'Shut the front door. I'm heading to Coles right now'.

However some questions were raised about the flavour, namely whether it would just 'taste like regular chicken chips', but those who have been able to purchase them confirmed that wasn't the case.  

'No they are more distinct definitely, worth trying them for sure,' said one customer.

One man suggested crushing up the chip packet and baking them on top of an actual chicken nugget, creating a 'flavour explosion'.

Coles Senior Product Developer Elizabeth Babic said the quirky mash-up of the snacks follows the successful launch of Coles Special Burger Sauce Chips and Coles Hot Cross Bun Popcorn which took Australia by storm earlier in 2020.

'We've received an overwhelmingly positive response to our recent mash-ups,' Ms Babic told Daily Mail Australia.

There were some questions raised about the flavour profile, and whether it would just 'taste like regular chicken chips', but those who have been able to purchase them already said that wasn't the case (chips left)

'So we've taken two more iconic flavours and mashed-them with our popular deli-style chips to create the ultimate snack at home and give our customers something unique and exciting that they cannot get anywhere else.'

'It's important for us to have some fun with some famous flavours and we've dreamt of these mouth-watering concepts in our Coles development kitchens for months, so we're really excited our customers are already loving them as much as we do.' 

The chicken nugget flavoured chips are available at 835 Coles stores including some Coles Express sites while apple pie chips are stocked at 700 Coles supermarkets Australia-wide.
