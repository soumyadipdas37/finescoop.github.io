Right Said Fred have been slammed by social media users for joining an anti-lockdown march in London this weekend. 

Brothers Fred and Richard Fairbrass were slammed after tweeting a picture from the protest on Saturday. 

The pair posted a picture of protesters holding signs which read, 'The pandemic is a lie', and, 'A hug a day keeps the Covid away'. 

Alongside the picture the pair wrote: 'There was a really good atmosphere in Trafalgar Square today.'

Another sign referenced the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon - which alleges that a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles running a global child sex-trafficking ring is plotting against President Trump and will lead to a 'day of reckoning' involving the mass arrest of journalists and politicians. 

The pair's post spared a fierce backlash from their followers. 

Emma Kennedy wrote: 'I’d be very happy for you to go watch my Dr pals who have been working on ICU trying to save people with COVID since March.'

And another said: 'These are people who believe Princess Diana is living in a tunnel under London, that Bill Gates is in league with lizards and is seeking to tamper with our DNA at their behest and - probably, why not? - that the moon is made of cheese; they're not interested in reality....'

While a former fan wrote: 'You were one of my happiest musical memories. I’m frankly and deeply disappointed in you.' 

And James Felton said: 'What the hell do you have against lockdown, the six person rule doubles your audience.'

While another Twitter user wrote: 'Seems like a Deeply Dippy thing to say.' 

The brothers, who became enraged by the backlash, responded to say they would be blocking people who left hate comments.

Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters descended on to Trafalgar Square on Saturday 

They tweeted: 'If the best you've got is Far Right Said Fred, Deeply S****y, Too Sexy For my Mask, Bald C**** or t**** then don't be surprised if you're blocked for being predictable and boring.' 

When one followers called them out over the Q Anon sign in the picture, they replied: 'That's the foundation of free speech, allowing people to express themselves.

'It's irrelevant who we agree with or disagree with.'

Another then added: 'But then you are blocking people,' and the pop stars replied: 'Of course, it's social media, it's not real life. Plus predictable insults deserve no better treatment.'
