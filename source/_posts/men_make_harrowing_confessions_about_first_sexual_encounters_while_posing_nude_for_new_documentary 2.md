A former pupil of a top school attended by Boris Johnson has claimed teachers would force them to stand naked in their dormitories and balance slippers on their erect penises as part of 'extensive' abuse that saw some boys raped.

The man, now in his fifties, made the shocking confession in an enlightening new Channel 4 documentary, Me & My Penis, which aired at 10pm last night. 

The programme, which showed an erect penis in what is believed to be a UK broadcasting first, explored the taboo which surrounds the male sex organ and aimed to start a conversation about masculinity.  

Men filmed for the documentary, who weren't fully identified, were photographed by London-based British artist and fine art photographer Ajamu, whose radical portraits of the male body have pushed boundaries and provoked cultural debate.

While he shot their intimate photographs, the subjects discussed their varied experiences – from the pleasures of sex to stories of infertility and sexual abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, homophobia and mental health.

One man, from the north east, admitted he often feels 'wrong' during sex because his first experience of intercourse was being raped at the age of 10.

He said he resorted to violence to feel masculine, but spending time in prison after punching a doorman helped him face up to his demons.

Another subject, a gay man who grew up in a conservative Muslim family where sex 'did not exist', revealed he would physically stop himself from 'sinful' ejaculating while masturbating as a teenager - and is now left with permanent damage.

And a man in his forties, called Jason, broke down in tears while discussing losing 18 months of his life to depression after he was told he is infertile.

One of the most harrowing tales came from a man, born in the Sixties, who went to school with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

He recalled: 'I was sent to a really beautiful little school in the middle of the country, I was seven years old, Boris was there, the whole Johnson family was there. 

'It was seen as being the top school and everyone ended up at Oxford or Cambridge and a lot of them are in politics.

'Everybody thinks we're privileged, I tell you what you're lucky if you didn't go, you got away with it because it was s***. The longer I was there the more I discovered and realised what really was going on.'

He claimed a male teacher would come into their dormitory and make them stand 'completely naked'. 'I would have to get an erection and balance our slippers on the end of it,' he went on.

'Basically, who could get the hardest erection. He would wander round sort of watching, he was... he had really scary thick glasses and a wrinkly face like paper. That's what I remember of him.

While the man does not name the school, last year the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse scrutinised Ashdown House in Forest Row, East Sussex, pictured, a feeder school for top public schools such as Eton. Mr Johnson attended in 1975, six years after the first sexual abuse allegations were made 

'If he punished me, for example, he'd take me to his room and he would bend me over his bed and I could just hear him breathing over me, but he wouldn't touch me, and yeah, it was creepy, you know? For somebody that age, for someone who's seven years old, it's super creepy.'

The man admitted he didn't realise at the time how 'extensive' the abuse was, adding that some of his friends were 'essentially raped' by teachers because 'there's zero consent at that age'. 

'We were all seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. We were young,' he said. 'We were kids so there was no way I could have done anything at the time, but if we'd all known more about the way of the world and we'd been a bit older, we might have been able to do something.'

He admitted he and his classmates didn't talk about it for years, until the Jimmy Savile scandal - when he said it became apparent how 'damaging' the experience had been to some people's lives. 

'We bought a criminal case against some of the teachers. We've already been successful, we've had one locked up, and it meant justice for his victims,' he said.

While he did not name the school, last year the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse scrutinised Ashdown House in Forest Row, East Sussex, a feeder school for top public schools such as Eton. Mr Johnson attended in 1975, six years after the first sexual abuse allegations were made.

The man in the documentary claimed the abuse happened at a 'beautiful little school in the middle of the country' when he was seven years old and attending at the same time as PM Boris Johnson (pictured last week)

Lead counsel Fiona Scolding QC told the inquiry the school had an environment where 'sexual touching was seen as acceptable,' during almost 25 years of abuse from 1969.

She said allegations of sexual abuse had been made against at least seven Ashdown House staff, involving 15 complainants. Two of those staff have since died, and one cannot be found, she said. Another, Martin Haigh, who taught at the school between 1973 and 1975, is the only person to have been convicted.

Elsewhere in the documentary a man who was raped at the age of 10 said the resulting 'confusion' and trauma from the ordeal saw him jailed for 21 months after assaulting a doorman on a night out.

'During sex, I often feel wrong. Because my first experience of having sex was rape, I was 10, it's hard for me to separate the two,' he explained.

'The 10-year-old me dealt with it silently. I wore a mask, I were lost, I felt as though I couldn't talk to anyone about this. And then as I got a bit older I started questioning myself, am I gay, does this mean I'm gay because I've been with a boy?

'And it confused the life out of me, then the shame would set in, the guilt would set in, it affected my confidence in a way that it were like reverse psychology, I had to then prove, I felt so shallow and so small inside, that I'd so anything to prove to anyone I am a big man, I am a man.'

He added that he used jail as 'one big long look in the mirror', where he was forced to face who he really was and 'could no longer run away' from what had happened to him. 

The programme also touched on infertility. Jason, from Scotland, spoke of the 'indescribable' pain of being told he can't conceive his own child.

'It broke me to be honest, completely. And still does,' he said. 'I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child, but I know what it's like to lose a child you've never had. I lost probably 18 months of my life to depression.'

To move forward, he and his wife went down the sperm donor route, which threw up all kinds of emotions for Jason, who felt anxious that he wouldn't be able to bond with the child.

The couple got pregnant on their first try, and an emotional Jason said the birth of their son was 'absolutely everything'. 

'I love him so much,' he said through tears. 'Nothing will compare to having a child.' 

The documentary also discussed masturbation, with many men sharing their first experiences of it. 

One man, who grew up in conservative Muslim family in Bradford, told how he faced a moral dilemma as a teenager which ultimately scarred him for life, both physically and mentally.

'Within my family sex just did not exist,' he explained. 'The closest thing I had was a small handbook I got given by my mum, and it was a young Muslim's guide to puberty, and in there there was something about masturbation, going to Hell, so obviously when I was 13, 14, 15, and super randy, that became an issue.

While posing nude for Ajamu (pictured), many of the men in the film said they felt empowered and able to put their demons to rest

'To stop myself from ejaculating, which in my mind would complete the w*** and make it a full blown sin, I'd grip my penis really hard or physically try to stop myself from ejaculating, which led to physical scarring, physical damage. 

'I have a lot of negative associations with it now, so it's a tricky thing, which should just be pleasurable, which should just be so simple, and sometimes there's still that guilt.'

Having realised he was gay at primary school, this threw up more internal conflict which he admitted 'completely ripped him apart'. 

With suicide prohibited in his faith, he said he felt 'trapped' and took out his angst on his body.

While posing nude for Ajamu, the man admitted he felt empowered. 'It feels powerful to be stood here nude, naked, talking about things I've talked about, and I'm owning it,' he said

'It was too much, it was crushing and I took it out on my body, it was hacking at my body, it was punishing my body because I hated this vessel that I was attached to. I just wanted to rip my body apart, and I did physically start to rip it apart,' he recalled.

While posing nude for Ajamu, he admitted he felt empowered. 'It feels powerful to be stood here nude, naked, talking about things I've talked about, and I'm owning it,' he said. 

'This whole experience has been kind of airing out the dirty laundry and seeing that actually when I talk about it, it's not as powerful any more, it doesn't have as much of a hold on me, and it's kind of drawn a line under it.'
