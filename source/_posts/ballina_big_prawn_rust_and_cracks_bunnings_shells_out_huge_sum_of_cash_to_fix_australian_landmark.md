The iconic Big Prawn will undergo more costly maintenance after a $400,000 upgrade to get a tail. 

Rust and cracks have begun to appear on the West Ballina landmark, which is made of a reinforced steel frame covered with sprayed concrete. 

The Big Prawn stands outside of Bunnings Ballina, which owns the site and will foot the bill for further maintenance.  

Speaking to The Northern Star, Bunnings Ballina manager Daune Hoare said he is 'currently engaging a tradesperson to treat this'.

'During a recent routine inspection, we spotted some minor rust and a few minor cracks on the outside,' Mr Hoare said. 

'We're proud to have the iconic Ballina landmark out the front of our store and we are careful to make sure it's looked after.'  

The cracks and rust are minor so they do not impact the integrity of the structure, according to Bunnings.   

The Big Prawn was originally built in 1989 and is six metres wide and nine metres tall.

The Ballina Shire Council voted to allow the demolition of the Big Prawn in September 2009, but it was never acted upon. 

Bunnings purchased the site in 2011 and refurbished the Prawn as part of a $400,000 redevelopment, adding a tail to the concrete crustacean.      

The prawn now sits on a stand next to the entrance of the Bunnings Warehouse car park in West Ballina. 

It is one of Australia's many famous 'big things', which includes the Big Pineapple in Woombye, Queensland and The Big Banana in Coffs Harbour, NSW.
