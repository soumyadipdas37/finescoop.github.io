Betty Who has secretly tied the knot with fiancé Zak Cassar during quarantine.

The Australian pop sensation revealed the exciting news, as she promoted her feature debut in the HBO Max film Unpregnant.

She and the photographer announced their engagement back in November of 2017, and they still intend to have a big wedding when they can afford it, and when COVID-19 isn't as much of a factor.

The 28-year-old told ET Online: 'Honestly, we have been waiting to have a big wedding because we want to do it right and do it fancy. I just have to be so much more rich to throw a fierce fabulous wedding that I can actually afford.

'But we just felt like it was the right thing to just lock it down. So if we want to travel, we're together, we have each other’s rights and everything. We just want to feel safe and know that we can take care of each other.'

She also told Pride.com about how their honeymoon at home has been: 'It’s honestly so special and wonderful. 

'A silver lining of quarantine has been spending so much time together. Our lives have gone through a lot of changes so it’s almost like getting to know each other all over again. I feel really lucky.'

Girl's best friend: Betty showed off her diamond engagement ring on Instagram back in November of 2017, as she announced their engagement

Betty showed off her diamond engagement ring on Instagram back in November of 2017, as she announced their engagement.

She wrote: 'Okay @zcassar I GUESS I’ll marry you. Now my best friend has to work 100 times harder to get rid of me. I am the luckiest girl in the world today and every other day just because I know you. Let’s OWN this marriage thing.'

The Somebody Loves You artist began dating the son of Emmy-winning director Jon Cassar back in 2014.

She and Zak put on a chic display this week in matching black suits, as they caught her feature debut at the drive-in premiere of the HBO Max film Unpregnant.

She said of the role: 'And I won’t lie to you, it would be very full circle if I could make a budding, young queer girl feel 1/100th of the way Shane from The L Word made me feel'

She told Pride.com of the role: 'I LOVED it. Kira is definitely way cooler than I am. I wish I could wear that racing suit every day. It’s amazing how playing a bada**, powerful, self-assured woman rubbed off on me a little. 

'I’m still not as cool as her but I definitely learned a little something from her that lives in me now. And I won’t lie to you, it would be very full circle if I could make a budding, young queer girl feel 1/100th of the way Shane from The L Word made me feel.'

Largely considered to be a queer icon, she came out on Instagram back in October of 2018, when a fan asked if she felt 'exploitative' pandering to the LGBTQIA community.

Betty responded: 'Not that I should have to justify myself to you or anyone, but I have been in relationships with both men and women. 

'I have been deeply, earth shatteringly in love with both men and women. Just because I happen to be engaged to a man doesn’t mean that I haven’t found a home within the gay community.'
