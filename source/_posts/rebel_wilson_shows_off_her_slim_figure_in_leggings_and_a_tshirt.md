She's been on an incredible weight loss journey this year.

And on Friday, Rebel Wilson showed off her trim figure as she stepped out in West Hollywood after a workout. 

The 40-year-old looked fit and healthy in sporty activewear with a shopping bag in hand.

She was dressed in green sneakers, black leggings and a blue T-shirt.

After months of rigorous exercise and dieting, Rebel finally revealed her magic weight loss number last week.

The Bridesmaids star revealed she is currently 83kg (13 stone, or 183lbs).

The blonde uploaded photos of herself flaunting her slimmed-down figure in a blue wrap dress, explaining in the caption that she's not far off her goal weight of 75kg (11.8 stone, or 165lbs).

'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she wrote in the caption of her post.

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself "hmmmm...better not" and had a bottle of water instead.

She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'

Rebel has lost an estimated 18kg since the start of the year, after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

Time to pay! The Aussie comedian slipped some cash into the parking meter 

'So for me 2020 is going to be called "The Year of Health",' she wrote on Instagram at the time.

'So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she declared.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'
