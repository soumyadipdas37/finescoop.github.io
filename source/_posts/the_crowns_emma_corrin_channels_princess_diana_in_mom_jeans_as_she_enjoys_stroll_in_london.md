The Crown star Emma Corrin appeared to be taking inspiration from her character Princess Diana during a dog walk with a friend in London on Tuesday.

The actress, 24, wore a pair of high-waisted mom jeans with a white long-sleeved top tucked in and shirt wrapped around her waist.

The actress appeared relaxed and care-free on the walk, she teamed her low-key look with a collection of gold and pearl necklaces and staggered rings.

The 24-year-old actress, who will be seen portraying the mother of princes William and Harry in the upcoming fourth season of The Crown has admitted that she likes using the sex toy as a way to 'unwind'.

In an video interview with Vogue, which was published last week, she said of the gadget as she revealed the contents of her bag: 'It's great if you're stressed and need to unwind. Also, it kind of looks like a lipstick so, you know, nice and subtle.'

Princess Diana had a 'secret mascot' in the form of a sex toy, which she took with her on all overseas trips as a good luck charm, her former bodyguard revealed in 2016. 

Royal protection officer Ken Wharfe said the marital aid – which was referred to as 'Le Gaget', or 'the gadget' – was purchased on a 'wild staff night out' in Paris in 1992.

Fun: The star was joined by a friend on the dog walk as they enjoyed a stroll with three black pooches

Wharfe claimed he then persuaded Diana's sister Sarah McCorquodale to hide the sex toy in the Princess of Wales' bag the next day.

The shock revelation was made by Wharfe in an updated edition of his book Diana: Closely Guarded Secret. 

He added that the Princess 'loved pranks and practical jokes' and thought the toy was 'hilarious' before she quickly made it her 'secret mascot for foreign trips'.

The former bodyguard even claimed she once forgot to bring it along to a trip to Nepal after leaving it in a drawer at Kensington Palace.

Upcoming: The 24-year-old actress, who will be seen portraying the mother of princes William and Harry in the upcoming fourth season of The Crown has admitted that she likes using the sex toy as a way to 'unwind' 

But she was so adamant that it was her lucky charm, Wharfe claims she had it flown over from London in a diplomatic bag to the British Embassy in the South Asian country. 

He wrote that she attached 'almost superstitious importance' to the object and that Diana told him: 'You know everything will go wrong without it.' 

Emma will portray Diana during the early part of her relationship with the Prince of Wales, before handing over the role to Elizabeth Debicki, for series five and six of the hit Netflix drama.

The Misbehaviour star explained how she developed a sense of 'empathy and understanding' for the late princess.

Confession: In an video interview with Vogue , which was published last week, she said of the gadget as she revealed the contents of her bag: 'It's great if you're stressed and need to unwind. Also, it kind of looks like a lipstick so, you know, nice and subtle.'

Mascot: Princess Diana had a 'secret mascot' in the form of a sex toy, which she took with her on all overseas trips as a good luck charm, her former bodyguard revealed in 2016 

She told British Vogue: 'I feel I've got to know Diana like you would a friend. I know that sounds really weird, but I get a great sense of companionship from her.

'I suppose, over time, you kind of start to patch together a sense of empathy and a sense of understanding. I love figuring people out.'    

Diana married Prince Charles in 1981, and the couple welcomed sons William in 1982 and Harry in 1984. After separating in 1991, the couple divorced in 1997.

Emma's casting was announced in April 2019, with The Crown's creator Peter Morgan calling her 'a brilliant talent who immediately captivated us when she came in for the part of Diana Spencer.'

He said: 'As well as having the innocence and beauty of a young Diana, she also has, in abundance, the range and complexity to portray an extraordinary woman who went from anonymous teenager to becoming the most iconic woman of her generation.'
