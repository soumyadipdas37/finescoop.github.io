These pictures show a car being washed out to sea after the driver left it parked overnight - on a BEACH.

The silver BMW was abandoned on St Agnes beach in Cornwall, according to witnesses.

But shocked on-lookers said they returned this morning to find the vehicle had been swamped by the tide.

Local resident Esther Chase took pictures of the scene and said the vehicle in the sea was being tossed about by waves.

She said: 'I think a family had driven down at 1am.'  

The vehicle was towed away by a breakdown recovery driver a few hours later, who said 'it was floating around like a boat' when he arrived.

It's believed the car, which is now a write-off, belongs to a man from Falmouth. It  and was 'full of seaweed', said the recovery driver.  

The car became stuck at the bottom of the slipway during a manoeuvre.

The owners of the vehicle have not yet been identified.

Just last week tourists were advised against travelling to Devon and Cornwall as flash flooding had caused mayhem on the roads and resulted in major delays on the roads.  

Staycationers were rush into the country's top beauty spots to enjoy the three-day weekend - the last before Christmas.

Motorists travelling through the south-west became stuck in a huge traffic jam on the M5 between Exeter and Taunton including a 70-mile northbound queue and delays of up to two hours southbound. 

Witnesses say the driver of this vehicle is believed to have left it parked on the beach in Cornwall 

The roads had been flooded with water amid flash floods as Britain faced half a month's worth of rain fall in just three hours.

Despite a yellow storm warning put in place for a swathe of southern England and South Wales, holidaymakers remained undeterred.
