Utah woman, Larain Latter Jolley (pictured), has been charged in connection with the kidnapping of her six-year-old grandson

A Utah grandmother has been charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly refusing to tell police the whereabouts of her six-year-old grandson who authorities say was kidnapped by his biological mother over the weekend. 

Timothy Butler, the father of Terran Butler, contacted law enforcement to report that his son had been kidnapped on Saturday. 

According to a statement from the Unified Police Department, Terran was on a court supervised visit with his biological mother, Emily Jolley, 43, and her mother, Larain Latter Jolley, when the alleged kidnapping occurred. 

Police said Terran's father attempted to pick him up from the home only to discover that Emily had taken him from the residence without consent. 

Terran, who still hasn't been located, was last seen in the area of Millcreek with Emily Jolley. 

Latter was arrested by officers at her Millcreek home on Sunday, a day after an Amber Alert was issued for her grandson. 

According to Fox13, Latter was the adult supervising the visit. Terran's dad said that he tried contacting both Latter and Jolley before he reported the kidnapping to police.

Eventually, Butler made contact with Latter, who allegedly told him that his son had been taken by US Marshals and a warrant was out for his arrest. 

Upon arriving to Latter's home, police conducted a search for Terran. Later, in an interview, Latter admitted to police that she knew her grandson was safe, according to Fox13. 

She didn't tell police where her daughter and grandson are located.

Eventually, investigators discovered a text conversation between Jolley and Latter while searching through her cell phone.

According to the news station, a third woman by the name of Stephanie Barber was a part of the text chat and told Latter to tell officers that her daughter had moved out.

According to a Facebook post from Butler's girlfriend, Amelia Jensen Meneses, it's believed that Jolley had been planning the kidnapping 'for months even years'

Latter was charged with second degree felony obstruction of justice in connection with a reported child kidnapping.

Her bail has been set at $10,000. 

According to a Facebook post from Butler's girlfriend, Amelia Jensen Meneses, it's believed that Jolley had been planning the kidnapping 'for months even years'. 

Meneses said that Jolley lost all custody over Terran about 18 months ago 'and visits had to be supervised and at dads [sic] discretion'. 

Jolley is reportedly driving a blue 2008 Toyota Prius that has a Utah license plate with the number E847GT.

'Emily has ties to Washington State and may be traveling to Washington with Terran,' authorities said in a statement. 

Authorities are urging anyone with information on Emily Jolley's whereabouts to call 801-743-7000.
