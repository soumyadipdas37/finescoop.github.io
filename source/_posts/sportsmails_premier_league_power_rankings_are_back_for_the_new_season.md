Each week throughout the 2020-21 season, Sportsmail will bring you a Power Rankings table, listing the top-10 hottest players in the Premier League.

As the stories of the season unravel, the rankings will provide a form guide with players moving in and out of the top 10 depending on both their performances in the previous fixtures and also in recent weeks.

So, who wins a place in the first edition of the new season's Power Rankings?

10. Mateusz Klich - Leeds

Although they were beaten by Liverpool, Leeds' display at Anfield showed why teams must be wary of the threat they pose on their Premier League return.

Yes they conceded four goals but they caused the champions a number of problems and should have come away with a point at least. Klich was at the heart of that impressive display.

He was full of energy and his passing linked the midfield and attack well. The Pole also found the back of the net with a sumptuous finish to bring Marcelo Bielsa's back level for a third time in the game.

9. Tariq Lamptey - Brighton

There is a lot of hope for the 19-year-old right back and he again reminded people of the potential he has with a superb performance against Chelsea on Monday night.

Lamptey broke into the Brighton team at the back end of last season and has become a regular under Graham Potter in recent months. 

He was strong in the tackle and drove forward to provide Brighton with an attacking outlet on the flank. Another talented English prospect at right back.

8. Wilfried Zaha - Crystal Palace

Still no move away from Selhurst Park for Zaha and Palace fans will be grateful for that. He was once again their match winner against Southampton on Saturday.

The Ivorian showed his composure to slot past Alex McCarthy for the winner and was a constant menace with his runs in behind. Zaha had another ruled out by VAR later on.

Palace need Zaha to be at his best in front of goal to keep them out of a relegation battle and week one was an impressive start to the season. 

Wilfried Zaha was Crystal Palace's match winner once again in the victory over Southampton

7. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – Arsenal

Aubameyang picked up where he left off from the Community Shield win over Liverpool at the end of August with a fine goal against Fulham on Saturday.

The former Dortmund striker collected the ball on the left after a superb switch of play from Willian, then cut inside onto his stronger right foot and smashed a finish into the far corner. 

He is due to sign a new contract any day now and it will be a major boost for Mikel Arteta's challenge for the Champions League places to have his star man commit his future to the club.

6. Jamie Vardy – Leicester

The winner of last season's Golden Boot showed no sign of slowing down in front of goal as he netted a brace of penalties on the opening weekend of the season.

Vardy, now 33, fired past a helpless Sam Johnstone twice from 12 yards at The Hawthorns as the Foxes ran out comfortable 3-0 winners over the newly-promoted side. 

He sent the Baggies stopper the wrong way on both occasions, showing the ice cool finishing that has made him one of the most reliable finishers in the Premier League. 

Jamie Vardy scored his first two goals of the new season with a brace of penalties at West Brom

5. Reece James - Chelsea

After breaking into the first-team picture at Stamford Bridge last season, James must now nail down the right back spot as his own.

On Monday night he showed exactly what he can offer offensively, scoring a sensational goal from distance and providing the cross for Kurt Zouma's strike at the AMEX Stadium.

But he did struggle defensively and will need to quickly improve that part of his game before the visit of Liverpool to Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

4. Allan - Everton

Carlo Ancelotti knew exactly what he was getting from Allan when he moved to sign his former player from Napoli this summer.

Everton's midfield has been missing some bite and aggression for years but now appears to have it with Allan forming a new-look partnership alongside Abdoulaye Doucoure. 

The Brazilian ran the midfield in the win over Tottenham, regaining possession and offloading the ball to his team-mates. If they are going to battle for the European places then Allan will be crucial.

3. Gabriel Magalhaes - Arsenal

Defence has been a problem position for Arsenal for years now but do they finally have a solution? If Gabriel's debut at Fulham was anything to go by then they just might.

The Brazilian, who arrived from Lille for £27m this summer, was composed in possession, strong in the tackle and was barely flustered as the Gunners kept a clean sheet at Craven Cottage.

He also found the back of the net from a set piece. There will be tougher afternoons to come for him but it was definitely a good start. 

Gabriel caught the eye in Arsenal's win over Fulham, keeping a clean sheet and scoring

2. Willian - Arsenal

If there was any animosity from Arsenal fans towards the former Chelsea player then there certainly won't be after his impressive debut on Saturday.

The Brazilian was a constant menace to Fulham's defence on the right of the front three alongside Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette.

Willian played the superb pass out to Aubameyang for his goal and also crossed the ball for Gabriel to head home. Arsenal fans will soon forget Willian played in Chelsea blue if he keeps this up.  

Willian was superb on his Arsenal debut, chalking up two assists in the win over Fulham

1. Mohamed Salah - Liverpool

Liverpool's rise to the summit of European and domestic football under Jurgen Klopp has been largely powered by Mohamed Salah's goals and he started the new campaign with a bang.

Salah took just four minutes to score his first goal of the season, winning a penalty after his effort was blocked by Robin Koch's arm and then slamming it home.

The Egyptian then doubled his tally with an unstoppable finish from inside the area before completing his treble with another spot kick after Rodrigo had tripped Fabinho in front of The Kop.

Many are calling for Liverpool to strengthen their squad in the transfer window but there are very few players who could come close to rivalling, or acting as understudy for, the 'Egyptian King' at the moment.
