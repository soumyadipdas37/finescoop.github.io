Autumn is around the corner. Think cooler nights, pumpkin spiced lattes and transitional wardrobe essentials like dresses that work equally well with bare legs or tights and cute knits that go with everything.

And according to Amazon shoppers, there's one style in particular that you should stock up on for the coming months: the iChunhua Long Sleeve Sweatshirt. 

With nearly 1,000 reviews, the lightweight sweatshirt has fast become the number one bestseller in Amazon's Women's Sweatshirts category and a favourite among savvy shoppers who can't get enough of its comfortable fit and lightweight design.

 The iChunhua Long Sleeve Sweatshirt starts at £11.89 depending on size and colour you select, so it's no wonder shoppers are adding several to their online shopping baskets

It's available in an array of colours, from classic black to seasonal aubergine, and designed with a relaxed fit, a crew neckline and pockets.

'Love this. Not too thick, just right for early autumn (as now!) and for spring,' one reviewer wrote. 'Looks great, fits nicely. I ordered my usual size, really happy with it. Don't like jumpers too big, but not figure hugging either, this is perfect.'

Another shopper commented: 'Love this! Received yesterday, I had the same in black as well but ordered the pink with animal print sleeves.

'The size is perfect and very flattering got the size L I'm about a 14-16. Will definitely order more the material is stretchy, soft and comfortable. Good quality stuff highly recommend.'

A third shopper wrote: 'Fantastic with leggings and jeans. Good bottom coverage. I have three of these tops in different colours - all long-sleeved version.

'Great for walking as high cotton content. Good for lolling around on the sofa in but look fine for popping to shops. I am fighting the urge to get a fourth one.'
