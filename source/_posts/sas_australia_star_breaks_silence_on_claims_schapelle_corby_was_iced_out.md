Schapelle Corby is one of the famous faces taking part in Channel Seven's new military-style reality show SAS Australia.

But reports suggest that the 43-year-old convicted drug smuggler was 'iced out' by the rest of the cast during filming in the NSW Snowy Mountains.

Her co-star Merrick Watts addressed the speculation on Hughesy & Ed on Monday, and seemingly hinted that the rumours weren't true.

'There has been a lot of conjecture about Schapelle Corby and how she was treated by the rest of the cast,' the 46-year-old comedian said.  

'I'm here to tell you the only time anyone got upset with Schapelle was me... because I was bought on the show as the drug trafficker and I found out she was doing my gear I was very very upset!' he added.

Merrick's humourous response seems to suggest that the cast warmed to Schapelle despite her notoriety and didn't give her the cold shoulder. 

Gruelling: Merrick went on to add that the series is '100 per cent real' and that 'there is no script writing and production involved'. Pictured: Schapelle Corby on SAS Australia 

Merrick went on to say that SAS Australia was '100 per cent real' and that there was 'no script writing and production involved'.

'Once you start that show is is absolutely break-neck speed,' he said. 

His comments come after several reports emerged claiming that Schapelle was 'iced out' by her co-stars while filming for the series.

Both Woman's Day and New Idea claimed she was shunned by the other celebrities, who did not believe a convicted criminal deserved to be there.

'Some of the more high-profile celebs were fuming,' a source told Woman's Day, adding that several stars didn't want to 'associate with her' at all.

Sydney PR queen Roxy Jacenko was allegedly very unhappy to be sharing the screen with Schapelle, who spent nine years in a Bali jail for marijuana smuggling.

'When [Roxy] learnt Schapelle was going on the series, she was not impressed,' a source claimed to New Idea.

The source added: 'Roxy wanted to be the alpha female, but Schapelle immediately stole her thunder.'
