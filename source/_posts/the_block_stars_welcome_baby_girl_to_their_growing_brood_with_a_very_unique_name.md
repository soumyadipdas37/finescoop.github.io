The Block stars Bec and George Douros have welcomed their third child - a baby girl.

The married couple, who appeared on Nine's renovation program in 2013, shared the exciting news to Instagram on Friday. 

Cuddling up for a photo with the newborn in the delivery room, the proud parents said: 'Still can’t believe we have a daughter! Crying tears of joy in this moment.'

Bec and George used another photo of their baby girl wrapped snug in a blanket to reveal her sweet name to fans.

'Hi world, my name is Rosetta Dafni,' they captioned the adorable image of the newborn with a large pink bow on her head.

Little Rosetta’s name appears to be a touching tribute to Bec’s late mother Rosa, who died of breast cancer during filming of The Block in 2013.

In 2018, after becoming the mother to two young boys, Bec told 9Honey the loss of her mother affected the way she felt about being a mum.

'It's very difficult to lose a parent and then become a parent yourself... You realise how hard it is to be a parent, and you just want to thank them,' she said at the time.

Bec and George are already the parents to sons Lenny, born in 2018, and Archie, born in 2016.

The pair announced they were expecting their third child earlier this year, in a post shared to Instagram.

'Baby #3 is on its way. Our lives are about to get a whole new level of crazy and we can’t bloody wait,' they said at the time.  

The couple, who competed on The Block: Sky High, took home a profit of $242,000 in 2013 when their South Melbourne apartment sold at auction for $1.5 million. 

Since leaving the show, they went on to renovate their own home as well as start a building and design business, Nectar.
