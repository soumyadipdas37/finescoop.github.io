Natalie Portman is set to wield the mythical hammer in the next film Thor film, set for release in 2022.

But that doesn't mean Chris Hemsworth, 37, will be stepping away from the action hero role which made him a global megastar. 

Speaking to Poland's Elle Man this month, Chris confirmed he won't be retiring his famous character after Thor: Love and Thunder.

Is this his last Thor film? Hollywood actor Chris Hemsworth, 37, has set the record straight on rumours he is leaving the Marvel superhero role 

Are you crazy?! I'm not going into any retirement period,' he said. 

 'Thor is far too young for that. He's only 1,500 years old. It's definitely not a film that I say goodbye to this brand. At least I hope so.'

Thor: Love and Thunder has already started production in Australia and Oscar winner Natalie Portion landed Down Under earlier this month to start filming the movie. 

Chris said he expected the film's script would be a huge hit with fans while speaking with the Philadelphia Inquirer in April this year. 

'It's one of the best scripts I've read in years,' he told the publication. 

'It's [director] Taika [Waititi] at his most extreme, and at his best. If the version I read is the one we get running with, it's going to be pretty insane.'  

The movie, the fourth in the action franchise, reunites Hemsworth with Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman, and also features Christian Bale.       

Natalie will be playing The Mighty Thor in the highly anticipated Marvel Studios movie.

The actress revealed at San Diego Comic-Con last year that she will return as Jane Foster in Thor: Love and Thunder. 

Meanwhile, before production began Australian-born Chris said he had been adjusting to the slower pace of life during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Hollywood actor told the same publication he had wanted to dive into the 'stillness' for many years, which the pandemic has allowed him to.  

'Not to diminish by any means the challenges that are occurring, the absolute uncertainty, the anxiety that is happening in the world, but me personally, and to that question, it's (created) a forced sort of meditation and forced sort of stillness that I haven't been able to dive into like I've wanted to for many years,' he said.
