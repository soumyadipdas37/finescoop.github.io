Leeds are closing on a deal worth up to £20million for Real Sociedad defender Diego Llorente.

Leeds have turned to the 27-year old centre back after seeing their other defensive target Dinamo Zagreb’s Josko Gvardiol choose Red Bull Leipzig instead.

Lorente, formerly of Real Madrid, has been watched by a number of Premier League sides in recent seasons and has a £45m buy out clause that Sociedad usually insist upon.

Diego Llorente is on the brink of joining Leeds from Real Sociedad for £20million 

However, they are willing to negotiate in this instance as they look to get money into the club.

Llorente has not always convinced regarding his consistency but Leeds hope his experience can help their young squad.

They are also looking to add a winger.

However, a deal for Udinese‘s £30m-rated attacking midfielder Rodrigo de Paul is unlikely at this stage. 

Llorente has plenty of experience and has been capped by Spain on five occasions
