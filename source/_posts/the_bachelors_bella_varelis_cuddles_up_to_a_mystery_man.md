She was one of the favourites to win Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart.

But Bella Varelis has well and truly proved she doesn't get the final rose during next week's finale.

The brunette beauty was spotted frolicking on Bondi Beach with fellow bachelorette Bec Cvilikas this week after the pair moved in together.

More pictures that spoil the end of The Bachelor: Bella Varelis cuddled up to a mystery man as she and Bec Cvilikas frolicked on Bondi Beach in tiny bikinis last weekend 

Even though Bachelor finalists are encouraged to keep a low profile while their season airs, Bella and Bec chose to top up their tans at yet another paparazzi hotspot.

They made no effort to hide their friendship, chatting and laughing away as they put their towels on the sand.

Fans are now convinced that Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler.

Firm friends: The two women have moved in togetherÂ 

Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale.

However, it's important to note that some former Bachelor winners have remained friends with their co-stars.
