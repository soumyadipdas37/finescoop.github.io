Colin Firth's estranged wife marked his 60th birthday on Thursday by sharing a flamboyant snap of the actor dressed as Elton John. 

Livia Giuggioli took to Instagram to share the playful snap of Colin in a Madi Gras carnival costume alongside the words '60th and not feeling it!'.

It comes as the Bridget Jones star was cut a casual figure in a charcoal coat and grey flat cap on Wednesday, a day before hitting the milestone.

Livia wrote: '60th and not feeling it. happy birthday to the best partner in crime ever (for the last 25 years and counting) (this is when Colin stole Elton John costume on the Kingsmen set...'

But Colin was looking a little less theatrical as he enjoyed a walk in London a day before turning 60. 

The Love Actually icon teamed his jacket with a navy jumper, jeans and trainers.

Back in December, Colin announced he has split from his wife Livia but said they remain 'united in their love for their children' almost two years after it emerged she had an affair with her childhood friend.  

The Love Actually star confirmed the news in a statement, and insisted he would maintain a 'close friendship' with Livia.

The couple have been married for 22 years, and have two sons, Luca and Matteo.

A statement said: 'Colin and Livia Firth have separated. They maintain a close friendship and remain united in their love for their children.

'They kindly ask for privacy. There will be no further comment'.

Their split comes after it was revealed in March last year Livia was alleged to have had a year-long affair with Italian journalist Marco Brancaccia. 

The Academy Award, Golden Globe and Bafta winner shares a son with former partner Meg Tilly, his co-star in the film Valmont.

After they split Firth met Guiggioli on the set of BBC Drama Nostromo, and married her a year later in Tuscany, Italy.
