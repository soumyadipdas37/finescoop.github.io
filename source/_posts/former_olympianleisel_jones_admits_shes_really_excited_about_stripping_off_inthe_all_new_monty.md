She's set to strip off on Channel Seven's upcoming The All New Monty: Guys & Gals, and Leisel Jones said she's 'actually really excited' about it.

In an interview with The Courier Mail on Monday, the 35-year-old former Olympic swimmer said she isn't nervous about baring her bits on TV. 

'I'm actually really excited about stripping off. I'm not very backwards in coming forwards about that sort of stuff. It's not really a real issue for me,' she confessed.

The naked truth: She's set to strip off on Channel Seven's upcoming The All New Monty: Guys & Gals, and Leisel Jones said she's 'actually really excited' about it

'I just remind myself every day, "No one cares what I look like, and if they do, that's their stuff, it's not mine." I don't need to worry about what other people's opinions are.

'As long as I'm living a good life, keeping my health up and doing the right thing by other people, then I can't complain.'

It's a refreshing outlook from the former athlete, after she previously admitted to suffering from body image issues.

In an interview with triple j in March 2016, the former breaststroke champion confessed she was convinced she was fat, even while swimming in the Olympics.

She revealed she even went on a 'soup diet' in the lead up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.

'I did a soup diet and didn't eat anything else other than soup and a bit of cereal,' she confessed.

'That was certainly very silly. I was so desperate to drop weight I took it too far and became really obsessed about eating. You're trying to fuel an elite athlete and certainly living on soup isn't enough.'

Leisel said it wasn't until after she retired from swimming that she started to realise just how unhealthy her relationship with her body was.

'We weren't there to look amazing. They didn't hand out gold medals just because you look more of an athlete than someone else. I received gold medals and won gold medals because I was the best athlete there was,' she reflected.  

'I'm actually really excited about stripping off. I'm not very backwards in coming forwards about that sort of stuff. It's not really a real issue for me,' she confessed
