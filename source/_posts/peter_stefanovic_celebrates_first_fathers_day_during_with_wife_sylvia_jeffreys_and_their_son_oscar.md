They welcomed their first child together, a son named Oscar, in February.

And on Sunday, Peter Stefanovic, 38, rang in his first Father's Day with a stroll through his local park in Sydney with his wife Sylvia Jeffreys, 34, and their adorable bundle of joy.

The Sky News star looked every inch the doting dad as he sweetly lifted the seven-month-old in the air.

Making the most of Sydney's warmer spring weather, Peter kept it low-key in a grey top, pastel pink shorts and flip flops.

Today Extra host Sylvia nailed sports chic in a grey hoodie with blue and green striped sleeves.

She added a pair of khaki leggings and comfortable trainers, while chic shades cemented her off-duty look.

The happy couple, who wed in 2017, appeared happy and relaxed as they strolled through the park.

Peter couldn't resist stopping to pick up his sweet son Oscar for some extra cuddles on the special holiday which celebrates fatherhood.

Meanwhile, after giving birth to little Oscar in February, Sylvia returned to work in late July following her maternity leave.

For her first day back, the TV presenter flaunted her incredible post-baby body in a bold red suit by Rebecca Valance that highlighted her trim figure. 

'First day back,' she wrote in the caption of an Instagram post.

Ahead of her TV comeback, the new mother said that she was ready to get back to work, which she will do on a part-time basis working from Monday to Wednesday, while Belinda Russell will be at the desk on Thursdays and Fridays.
