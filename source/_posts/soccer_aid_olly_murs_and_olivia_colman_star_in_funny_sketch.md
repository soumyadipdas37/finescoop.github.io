Olly Murs was left disappointed as Olivia Colman declined his offer to join the England football team for annual charity game Soccer Aid against the Rest of the World at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday.

Speaking via a video call, the captain, 36, attempted to persuade the award-winning actress, 46, to play in the match, but the screen star made it clear she'd only be interested in taking part in TV, theatre and film roles.

The Voice judge later reached out to will.i.am, Dolly Parton, Alan Carr, Alison Hammond and Rylan Clark-Neal, before settling with comedian Joel Dommett.

The funny sketch kicked off with the former X Factor star approaching manager Sam Allardyce, joined by fellow coach Wayne Rooney, for advice on who to recruit for the group.

Olly's description of the job clearly confused The Crown star Olivia, who believed she was signing up for an acting stint. 

'Do you have a script you can send me? I can research the striker and it can grow originally! Do you have Dame Judi on board?', the thespian asked, before the musician said: 'Just Mark Wright!'

An unimpressed Olivia boldly replied: 'I think I'll pass!'

Eager: The desperate artist later called other celebrities, including Alan Carr and Alison Hammond, who both refused to take part

The desperate artist later called host Alan, 44, and This Morning's Alison, 45, who said respectively: 'Yes, I will manage your England team. My dad used to manage Northampton footcball club... I'm talking about my singing career, not football!' 

Failing to find potential teammates, former Big Brother presenter Rylan, 31, added salt to the wound as he asked: 'I haven't got to wear one of them football shirts do I?, before American singer Dolly, 74, admitted: 'Sorry Olly, I'm working 9 to 5!'

Olly's fellow The Voice coach will.i.am, 45, was enthusiastic for the wrong reasons as he suggested: 'Every time we score, I want to sing and change our outfits. Who else is playing that sings? Come on bro, most of the time you're just on Instagram!'

The media personality was left to take in The Masked Singer UK's Joel, 35, who put on a goofy display by wearing a David Beckham face mask while revealing he was more than excited to join the team.

The TV star said: 'It's different from previous soccer aids. It feel as amazing to be captain, I feel very lucky.'

The Body Coach Joe Wicks surprised host Kirsty Gallacher as he confessed he struggled to keep up with his teammates during training for the game, despite keeping the nation fit with his daily P.E. exercise sessions. 

The fitness enthusiast, 33, said: 'Everyone assumes I'm the Body Coach but I'm not match-fit. My body is aching and I'm not used to this!'
