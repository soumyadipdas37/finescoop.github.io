A quarantined lawyer is so outraged at Queensland's border stance he has vowed to spend $1,800 every week until the election to fly a sign over Brisbane slamming the premier.

James Stevens is paying for a banner calling Annastacia Palaszczuk 'heartless' to be flown behind a plane from Coolangatta to Brisbane.

The message is in response to Queensland's border restrictions which Mr Stevens said have 'to stop'.  

He said seeing people being denied exemptions to attend funerals or visit dying relatives was 'the most outrageous' thing he had ever seen.

'I nearly threw my computer at the TV when I saw that,' he told ABC News.

'She (Annastacia Palaszczuk) has exhibited a real callousness, a cold-hearted attitude to people's suffering and problems.'

Ms Palaszczuk has repeatedly stated that the Chief Health Officer, Jeannette Young, has the final say on border exemptions. 

Mr Stevens, who is in quarantine in Brisbane after returning from Sydney, isn't the only person paying to send a message to the Queensland Government. 

Brisbane landscaper John McInerney used the same company to have a banner reading 'vote her out' flown from the Gold Coast to Brisbane. 

Both men said they don't have any political affiliations and were standing up against what they saw as an injustice. 

Currently a person is given a health exemption to enter Queensland from a COVID-19 hotspot if the urgent medical care can't be provided from a closer location.

Anyone granted permission to enter Queensland from a COVID hotspot is required to go into 14-day quarantine in approved accommodation and at their own expense.

Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce described Queensland's hardline border measures as a sham after American actor Tom Hanks was allowed to enter the state.

Hanks returned to Australia earlier this month to finish shooting a film, quarantining at a Gold Coast hotel with 11 other family, cast members and production staff.

Their entry was approved by the federal home affairs department at the request of the Queensland government.

Meanwhile no new COVID-19 cases were recorded in Queensland, while New South Wales recorded four new cases. 

'It's in stark contrast to people who can't go to funerals, and that's what aggravates me so much,' Mr Joyce told the Seven Network.

'We've got the AFL in there first class, we've got Tom Hanks in there, we've got his offsiders in there, but we can't get a person across to see their dad buried.'
