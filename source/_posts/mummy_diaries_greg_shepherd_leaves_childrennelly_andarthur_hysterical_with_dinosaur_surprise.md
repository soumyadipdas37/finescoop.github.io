Not so roarsome! on Thursday's episode of The Mummy Diaries, Greg Shepherd accidentally leaves his children terrified after his fun family surprise spectacularly backfires

And when Greg surprises his two children with a huge dinosaur in the garden, the youngsters are left hysterical as they start crying and screaming over the elaborate gift.

Trying to encourage the youngsters to meet the dinosaur, Greg says: 'Arthur, do you want to come meet him? He's our friend, Arthur.'

To which Nelly and Arthur start crying even more as the dinosaur, which is a man dressed in a huge costume, roams the garden.

And things go from bad to worse when the noise interrupts a fuming Billie as she comes downstairs to comfort her two children.

T-Rex on the loose! And when Greg surprises his two children with a huge dinosaur in the garden, the youngsters are left hysterical as they start crying and screaming over the elaborate gift

Trying to explain, she says: 'It's just pretend, it's just pretend,' with Nelly screaming: 'No!'

Attempting to make a joke out of the situation, Greg quips: 'Be careful if you are living in Brentwood... there's a T-Rex on the loose!'

Speaking behind-the-scenes, Billie explains: 'I get that he thought this was going to be great but actually we avoided going to a kid's birthday party a few months ago because they had one of these T-Rex dinosaurs there. 

'We knew Nelly and Arthur wouldn't like it! It completely backfired and all it did was prolong my shoot.' 

Not impressed: And things go from bad to worse when the noise interrupts a fuming Billie as she comes downstairs to comfort her two children

It's pretend! Trying to explain, she says: 'It's just pretend, it's just pretend,' with Nelly screaming: 'No!'

Going back to the scene of the dinosaur, Billie is forced to take her hysterical children upstairs to get away from the huge costume.

While a sheepish Greg has to send away the dinosaur hire company and apologise for his upset children.

He says: 'They're having none of it, they won't even come downstairs at the moment. Thanks, I appreciate it.'

And when Greg goes upstairs, he is confronted by an annoyed Billie who says; 'Greg, you dealt with that all wrong.'

Fuming: Speaking behind-the-scenes, Billie explains: 'It completely backfired and all it did was prolong my shoot.'

Oh dear: Yet Nelly and Arthur are still hysterical over the dinosaur with Billie remarking: 'No offence, but I've really got to get on. Great daddy daycare!'

The reality star then attempts to calm down his two children again as he says: 'Listen, you two, the man just left. It's not a real dinosaur in the garden, he was just dressed up.'

Yet Nelly and Arthur are still hysterical over the dinosaur with Billie remarking: 'No offence, but I've really got to get on. Great daddy daycare!'

Explaining his actions, Greg says: 'I didn't intend, if you had helped me' with Billie replying: 'I didn't know what was going on!'

Feeling deflated over his backfired surprise, Greg goes downstairs while his two children continue to cry over the dinosaur.

And as well as Billie, Greg gets told off by daughter Nelly as she jokes in a behind-the-scene clip: 'Naughty daddy!' 

The Mummy Diaries continues at 9pm on ITVBe.
