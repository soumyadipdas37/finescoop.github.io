He's been back to work on Mission Impossible 7 after filming was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

And Tom Cruise wasn't taking any chances as he prepared to film another heart-stopping scene, as he donned a face mask to practice his latest fight on Saturday.

The Hollywood star, 58, was dressed in all-black as he rehearsed his latest scuffle with a stuntman aboard a train in Norway, after production for the blockbuster was relocated from the UK following a five-month break.

Head-to-head: Tom Cruise, 58, wasn't taking any chances as he prepared to film another heart-stopping scene, as he donned a face mask to practice his latest fight on Saturday

Dressed in a black jumper and beanie hat, Tom sported a matching filtered face mask as he rehearsed the fight.

The star - who will reprise his role as Ethan Hunt in the spy film series - was attached to a harness for the scuffle on the roof of a train, and briefly chatted to crew members as he prepared to film the scene.

The scenes were filmed in the heart of the Norwegian countryside with a vintage-style train recreated as the setting, surrounded by plenty of scaffolding.

Never shy to take on a challenging stunt, the scene also saw Tom running towards a helicopter as it took off into the sky.

After production for Mission Impossible 7 was moved to Norway, it was reported that Tom hired a £500,000 ship for the film's crew to avoid any coronavirus-related delays.

Filming was already delayed for five months after COVID-19 spread across Italy, where production had been based in March, leading the release date to be pushed back to November 2021.
