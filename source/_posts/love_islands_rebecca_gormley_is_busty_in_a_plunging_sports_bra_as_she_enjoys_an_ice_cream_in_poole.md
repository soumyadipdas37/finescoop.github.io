She recently enjoyed a sun-soaked trip to Marbella.

And Rebecca Gormley continued to make the most of the sunshine as she put on a busty display in a plunging grey sports bra in Poole, Dorset, on Friday. 

The Love Island star, 21, appeared to be in good spirits during her day out and was seen tucking into an ice-cream complete with a chocolate flake and sprinkles. 

Flaunt it: Rebecca Gormley looked sensational as she showed off her sensational figure in a camo-print sports bra and leggings set in Poole, Dorset, on Friday

Rebecca kept things casual as she strolled along the street in a grey camo-print set which accentuated her toned frame.

The beauty added a pair of white trainers and a matching baseball cap to complete her sporty ensemble.

Always one to add some glam, Rebecca wore her long locks down and added a few loose curls for extra volume.

She also added a slick of pink lipstick and touch of mascara to accentuate her pretty features during the sunshine stroll.

It comes after the brunette beauty recently landed herself in hot water whe she and boyfriend Biggs Chris, 27, ignored quarantine rules. 

They jetted straight from a holiday in Spain to Scotland last month and brazenly posted about it on Instagram.

The couple had been holidaying in Ibiza, and should have quarantined for 14 days when they returned to the UK after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases.

While earlier this year, their relationship seemed to be on the rocks when Biggs was accused of messaging another woman just days after he and Rebecca reunited following 10 weeks apart in lockdown.

The Glaswegian car repair specialist is said to have exchanged a series of messages with healthcare assistant Caitlin Fulton, who claims she learned of his blossoming romance with Rebecca when she saw pictures of them kissing.

'We'd been messaging back and forth after he followed me on Instagram and we'd talked about going away when lockdown ended, to a holiday cottage or a lodge somewhere in the UK,' she told The Sun.

'He even left me a voice note saying that coming down to see me "sounded good". We were making plans as recently as Saturday.' 

Caitlin told the publication that she learned of Biggs' relationship with Rebecca when she saw photographs of them kissing in Newcastle.

'I was a bit shocked that he had a girlfriend,' she said. 'And obviously I would be shocked if that was my boyfriend messaging someone.'

The couple split up briefly before lockdown after she had a drunken sleepover with Love Island 2019 contestant Michael Griffiths.
