She was left teary-eyed, shell-shocked and blindsided after Locky Gilbert dumped her for arch-nemesis Irena Srbinovska in the nail-biting finale of The Bachelor.

However, while her quest to find love failed, Bella Varelis' turn on the popular dating series has allowed her to achieve another longtime goal of hers - stardom.

Newly resurfaced throwback images of the 25-year-old posing up a storm at several star-studded red carpet events hint that she has craved fame for years.

Bella was undoubtedly a natural in front of the Bachelor cameras thanks to her regular attendance at high-profile celebrity and fashion events over the years.

The brunette was expertly working her best angles at Priceline's Festival of Beauty launch event in February 2019 - more than a year before she became a household name.

A few months later, the digital marketing consultant put on a stylish display at the Boohoo x Nasty Gal x boohooMAN party in Sydney.

Once again posing for photographers, who are typically hired to snap established celebrities, Bella appeared in her element at the Natasha Oakley x Nasty Gal launch event in October 2019.

Meanwhile, Bella dated former Bachelorette star Samuel Johnson before vying for Locky's love and attention on television.

Bella was also linked to American Bachelor star Dean Unglert, with her former talent manager Michael Beveridge claiming that she had once planned to move to Hollywood to pursue her dreams of stardom.

Meanwhile, following her televised heartbreak, Bella appears to be getting back on her feet as Woman's Day allege that she has been spotted on dating app, Tinder.

A Tinder profile surfaced last week, with fans claiming they'd happily 'swipe right' to score a date with the marketing manager.

 It's unclear if the profile was real, as fake and catfish accounts often are created with photos of celebrity and reality TV stars.

Meanwhile, Bachelor host Osher Gunsberg has hinted the Sydney-based stunner could be headed for season four of Bachelor In Paradise to continue her newfound career as a reality television star.
