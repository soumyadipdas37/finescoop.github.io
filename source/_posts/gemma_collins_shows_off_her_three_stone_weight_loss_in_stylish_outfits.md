She's been embarking on a weight loss journey that has seen her shed three stone.

And Gemma Collins showed off the fruits of her labour as she promoted her new plus size range with InTheStyle in an Instagram post on Tuesday.

The Diva Forever star, 39, shared a slew of stylish snaps on social media, and she looked sensational in a long-sleeved black floral dress.

In a second snap Gemma showed off her slimmed down figure in a leopard print dress that was cinched at the waist.

While she opted for a more casual look for the third snap, as she teamed a black shirt with distressed denim jeans while posing at a chic hotel.

Gushing about the 'huge success' of her previous endeavours with the label, Gemma wrote in the caption: '2 days to go babyyyy GC X @inthestylecurve I’ve got my first proper clothing range dropping after the huge success of the memayyyy range!! 

'It launches on Thursday 6pm on the @inthestyle app!! Exclusive sizes 16-28 ladies and it’s amazing!! Perfect prints and shapes for autumn!'

It was previously reported that Gemma is set to cash in with a mega bucks deal with fashion brand In The Style after the huge success of her meme collection, with big names including Little Mix's Jade Thirwall seen wearing clothes from the range.

The blonde apparently raked in £100,000 in just one day earlier this year through sales of her new sweatshirt after Jade was spotted wearing one.

In The Style reportedly flew the TOWIE favourite to the Greek island to get snaps of her latest clothing range.

And Gemma did little to stop the chatter as she revealed she had a new collection with the clothing brand on her Instagram Story. 

A source told The Mirror: 'Gemma's made a mint for In The Style – her meme range was a sell out and stars like Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall have been seen in her designs.' 

They continued: 'They were desperate to get Gemma on board for a whole collection and she signed on the dotted line without hesitation.

'Gemma is so into her fashion and she loves the team at ITS so it was a no-brainer. Gemma flew out to Greece at the start of this week to model her debut line.'

MailOnline contacted a representative of Gemma for comment at the time.
