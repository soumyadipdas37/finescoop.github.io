A man, 36, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder in the ambush shooting of two Compton police officers.   

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva and District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced Wednesday that the gunman who shot two deputies in the head on September 12 is now in police custody. 

Two officers - 31-year-old Claudia Apolinar and her 24-year-old male colleague – were shot multiple times as they sat inside their patrol car outside the Metro Blue Line station at Willowbrook Avenue and Oak Street. 

Shocking surveillance footage captured the moment the black male suspect strolled up to the police cruiser and gunned the officers down at close range before fleeing the scene on foot.

Both officers survived and a massive manhunt was launched to find the gunman. 

Video released by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shows the moment that the male suspect opened fire on two deputies at a Compton bus station before fleeing on foot

FOX11 obtained a photo (above) of the female deputy covered in blood after she was shot in the jaw helping her colleague in the Saturday shooting
