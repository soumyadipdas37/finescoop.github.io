Nicole Kidman took some time out of her Wednesday to wish a very happy birthday to her on-screen husband, Hugh Grant.

Grant turns 60 years old today, with Kidman, 53, taking to her Instagram story to share a behind-the-scenes photo from their new mini-series The Undoing.

'Happy birthday to my on-screen husband in #TheUndoing #HughGrant,' Kidman captioned the snap, which showed them walking across a bridge together.

Grant was all smiles in a dark blue button down shirt and dark blue jeans while holding his phone as he strolled alongside his son-screen wife.

The Undoing is based on the 2014 novel 2014 novel You Should Have Known by Jean Hanff Korelitz, which reunites Kidman with her Big Little Lies creator David E. Kelley.

The Undoing follows Grace (Kidman) and Jonathan Fraser (Grant), who are living the only lives they ever wanted for themselves. 

Their peaceful world comes crashing down with a violent death and a chain of terrible revelations. 

Left behind in the wake of a spreading and very public disaster and horrified by the ways in which she has failed to heed her own advice, Grace must dismantle one life and create another for her child and her family.
