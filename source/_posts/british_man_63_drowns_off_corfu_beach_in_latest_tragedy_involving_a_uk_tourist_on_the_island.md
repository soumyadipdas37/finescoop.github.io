A 63- year old British drowned in Corfu in latest tragedy involving a UK tourist on the island.

His body was recovered from Issos beach, in South Corfu, Greece, today. 

Leukimi port authorities have launched an investigation on the scene. 

The 63- year old's body was recovered from Issos beach in South Corfu, Greece

 Earlier this month  two more Britons died on the island, a mother-of-four was killed by a speedboat in Avlaki beach and a 27-year-old man drowned off Kerasia beach.

Claire Glatman, 60, from Bedale, North Yorkshire, waved for help after being hit by a 'speeding water-ski' vessel.

 The 27- year old was swimming several hundred feet from the shore of Kerasia beach in northeastern Corfu, when he was seen struggling in the water, Corfu Press reports.
