Tottenham host Newcastle in north London in Premier League action this afternoon as Jose Mourinho's men look to build on their 5-2 victory over Southampton. 

Despite their opening defeat of the season against a new-look Everton, Spurs have since progressed through the Europa League qualifying rounds and smashed five past Southampton last week. They will have their sights on a top four spot. 

Newcastle, meanwhile, were uninspiring in their limp home reserve against Brighton and will be hoping to mount a response against the top flight giants. The team beat Morecambe in midweek by seven goals and will hope to record back-to-back victories.

Sportsmail's DANIEL DAVIS will provide live EPL coverage of Spurs vs Newcastle including score, lineups and build-up.
