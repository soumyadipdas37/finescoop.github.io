Neymar has been accused of making racist remarks towards a Marseille player during the heated clash in which the Brazilian star was sent off and accused an opponent of racial abuse. 

Five players were sent off during the derby between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month following a mass brawl in which Neymar claimed defender Alvaro Gonzalez called him a 'son of a b***h monkey'.  

Neymar was sent off after VAR found that he had thrown a punch at Gonzalez, before the Brazilian took to social media to insist that the Marseille defender was racially abusive towards him.

Marseille and Gonzalez have maintained their innocence, and the football authorities are investigating the claim made by Neymar. 

And according to Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, it is claimed that Neymar made racially abusive comments towards Marseille defender Hiroki Sakai during the game at the Parc des Princes.

The outlet says that the 28-year-old labelled the right back, who is of Japanese origin, a 'Chinese s***', and that Marseille has evidence of the Brazilian doing so before the alleged incident involving Gonzalez.

The 28-year-old has been out of action since being sent off for his role in the mass brawl

Neymar vented his fury with the Spanish defender on Twitter after the feisty contest, in which Marseille ran out 1-0 winners.

'You are not a man to assume your mistake, losing is part of the sport,' the Brazilian tweeted to Gonzalez after the game. 'Now insulting and bringing racism into our lives no, I don't agree.'

Gonzalez had tweeted: 'There is no place for racism... Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field. Incredible 3 points today. Allez l'OM. Thanks family.'

Neymar has been out of action for PSG as a result of a suspension handed to him for his part in the brawl, with Kylian Mbappe inspiring Thomas Tuchel's side to a 3-0 win against Nice last weekend.
