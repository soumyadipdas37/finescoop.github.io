She separated from Ashley Benson in April after nearly two years of dating. 

And now Cara Delevingne has reportedly moved on with the pop sensation, Halsey, just three months after their exes got together and began dating. 

The 28-year-old British model's ex Ashley, 30, began dating American rapper G-Eazy following their split.

G-Eazy was previously in a relationship with Cara's new rumoured love interest Halsey, 25, until they parted ways in 2018. 

According to The Sun, Cara - who currently resides in Los Angeles - has been enjoying a new romance with Halsey after separating from her actress beau a few months ago.  

Halsey previously dated G-Eazy, 31, but they separated following speculation that he had cheated on her, and the pair have continued to throw jabs at each other through their music.

Following his split from Halsey, the rapper was previously linked to Yasmin Wijnaldum and Megan Thee Stallion before he was spotted out with Ashley, just weeks after her breakup from Cara.

Halsey - who is openly bisexual - moved on from the rapper and was reportedly linked to singer Yungblud and actor Evan Peters. 

Now, Halsey and British actress Cara have reportedly been getting close during the current pandemic as they both reside in California.

A source close to the British model said to the website: 'Cara has been hooking up with Halsey in the last few weeks and they’ve been having a laugh together. 

'They’ve both been very open about their sexuality and just want to enjoy themselves so they’re both on the same wavelength.'

The insider also mentioned that the pair are having fun and are not in an exclusive relationship, so they are free to date other people if they choose. 

A source close to Cara said: 'Cara has been hooking up with Halsey in the last few weeks... It’s actually just funny to them that their exes are together now, and there’s no hard feelings.' 

'Cara has kissed her in front of friends and stuff. It’s not a big deal for either of them.

To complicate things even further, Halsey's real name is actually Ashley, the same name as Cara's ex/G-Eazy's current girlfriend.
