description: Further to our article of January 30 (Grooming of girls by Asian gangs fuelled by unhappy arranged marriages to cousins), Lord Ahmed has asked us to make clear that the phenomenon of Asian men preying on vulnerable young girls is not only by men from Pakistan, and nor are the victims always white. We are happy to set the record straight.
