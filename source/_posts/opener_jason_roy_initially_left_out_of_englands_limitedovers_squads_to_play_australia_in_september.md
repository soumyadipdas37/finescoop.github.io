England opener Jason Roy has been initially left out of the limited-overs squads to face Australia but a number of Test stars will return to white-ball duty.

Roy has been absent from the ongoing Twenty20 series against Pakistan because of a left side strain and will miss the three sprint format games against Australia, but there is a chance he could return for the trio of one-day internationals that follow.

The Surrey batsman will remain in England's 'bio-secure' bubble with a view to demonstrating his fitness.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler plus fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Mark Wood are included in the T20 squad for a series that gets under way on Friday at the Ageas Bowl, following the conclusion of their red-ball commitments.

Joe Root's T20 exile continues but the Test captain and seamer Chris Woakes join fellow World Cup winners Buttler, Archer and Wood in the ODI squad. Seamer Sam Curran also returns in both squads.

National selector Ed Smith said: 'These two series against Australia provide an exciting end to the summer.Â 

'We have selected strong squads. We are also continuing to develop depth in preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup.'
