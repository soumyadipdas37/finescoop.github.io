A one-legged thief already behind bars for a $20,000 armed robbery giggled when he faced court for stealing a sex toy and lubricants. 

Jack Quinlivan, 28, was convicted in the Moorabbin Magistrates' Court for stealing a vibrator, climax stimulating gel and delay gel from Chemist Warehouse in Chadstone, Melbourne, in November 2018.  

The lower-leg amputee said he 'borrowed' the sex toy and lube and forgot to pay because of his post-traumatic stress disorder, the Monash Leader reported. 

The court heard Quinlivan was waiting for a prescription to be filled when he took the items and left the chemist without paying.

Magistrate Victorian Campbell fined Quinlivan $100 and ordered him to pay $84.40 in costs. 

A conviction was also recorded. 

'He is a relatively young man who has had significant difficulties from birth, his whole upbringing was dysfunctional,' she said.

'Hopefully he can work off that fine while he's in custody.' 

The court heard Quinlivan had a criminal history littered with aggravated burglary offences. 

He still has at least nine months remaining on his sentence after pleading guilty to the 2019 armed robbery of the Holdsworth Bros. Jewellers, in Eastland. 

Quinlivan stole $20,000 worth of jewellery after threatening staff with a hammer and claiming to have a gun.

The amputee fled through a security door and hailed a taxi before being arrested two days later. 

He was sentenced in the County Court to a maximum four years and one month jail for the robbery, with a minimum 25 months to be served.
