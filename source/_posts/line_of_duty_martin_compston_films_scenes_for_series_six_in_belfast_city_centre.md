Filming for series six of Line Of Duty is well underway, with star Martin Compston seen shooting scenes in the centre of Belfast on Tuesday.

The Scottish actor, who is returning for a sixth series as DS Steve Arnott, was back in his character's signature waistcoat and dapper suit as he strolled around between takes. 

Martin was surrounded by masked crew members, and a wardrobe assistant in full PPE as part of the show's commitment to health and safety after they were forced to shut down shooting for six months earlier this year during lockdown.

Leading man Martin clutched a take out coffee as he waited for the shot to be set up outside a Belfast bar and newspaper offices.

The street had been closed for shooting with masked crew members seen milling around with the cast.

At one point a member of wardrobe in full ppe including a visor made sure Martin's smart suit was looking immaculate before action was called, with the actor standing patiently while she used a lint roller.

The star happily greeted curious passers-by, waving at fans in between his discussions with the production crew.

In an interview in 2017, Martin explained that Steve's love of three-piece suits was actually inspired by a friend of his, who told the actor about a colleague who was always overdressed for work.

'Before we started the first series a pal of mine who works in a call centre was telling me about someone who worked with him,' he told the Evening Standard.

'This guy was a right wee d**k and he wore waistcoats to work — who would wear waistcoats to work in a call centre?'

Where's your team? There was no sign of Martin's co-stars Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar on set on Tuesday 

Separated: Vicky was instead filming interior shots on the set of AC-12's offices, sharing an Instagram snap on Tuesday evening

Health and safety: At one point Martin wore a brightly patterned face mask as he got into a car to move locations

'And I thought: 'That's him – that's Arnott, the needlessly overdressed guy.'

Filming resumed earlier this month on the sixth series of Line of Duty, with new cast member Shalom Brune-Franklin seen for the first time on set on Monday.

Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar have also flown to Belfast for the shoot although they have yet to be pictured on set in the city, instead shooting inside on the set for AC-12's offices. 

The show was created and written by Jed Mercurio and is centred on the AC-12 Anti-Corruption Unit led by Supt Ted Hastings [Adrian Dunbar]. 

Production of the eagerly anticipated sixth season of the hugely popular series was halted by the Covid lockdown shortly after filming began earlier this year.

Line Of Duty insisted that they have worked with health and safety consultants in accordance to government guidelines to ensure the safety of cast and crew.

Executive Producer for World Productions, Simon Heath, said: 'It's been almost six months since we stopped shooting.

'But following our implementation of all the industry Covid protocols, we're delighted to be able to resume filming series six safely.'
