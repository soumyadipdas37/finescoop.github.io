Tiger Woods' ex-wife Elin Nordegren has sold the palatial Florida mansion she purchased as part of her $100 million divorce settlement. 

The Swedish-born blonde, 40, offloaded the home - located in North Palm Beach - for $28.64 million, more than two years after she first put it on the market. 

Nordegren initially listed the 11 bedroom, 18 bathroom compound for $49.5 million, before drastically slashing the price. 

The ex-nanny snapped up the 1.4 acre property following her split from Woods in 2010, and demolished the house that was already standing on the land. 

She subsequently built the sprawling 25,878-square foot oceanfront home that stands in its place today. 

Nordegren married the golf legend back in 2004, and the pair share two children, Sam, 13, and Charlie, 11. 

The couple split in 2010 after Woods' numerous infidelities were revealed.

The resort-style home is located right on the water, and boasts a cinema, wine cellar and gym.   

Inside the master bedroom, there are his and hers bathrooms, a walk-in closet, three fireplaces and a balcony perfect for watching the sunset over the Atlantic ocean.     

Several of the uniquely decorated guest bedrooms include an en-suite bathroom and walk-in closet. 

The luxury living quarters also include a formal living and dining room with envy-inducing sea views, along with a walk-in pantry.  

A further striking feature of the property is a statement soaring staircase illuminated by a three-storey Swarovski crystal chandelier. 

A mammoth outdoor swimming pool with waterslide and spa, lounge areas with fire pits, a putting green and a half basketball court are set in the estate's 1.4 acres of land. 

Making the property perfect for entertaining, it also encompasses a Cabana house and guesthouse with two, two-bedroom apartments.

The estate replaced a 17,000 square foot home built in 1932 that Nordegren bought for $12.2 million but had to tear down because it was riddled with rot.

Before demolition began in 2011, she gave Habitat For Humanity a month to salvage anything they wanted from the property.   

Woods and Nordegren were just shy of their sixth wedding anniversary at Thanksgiving 2009 when police were called to their Orlando home. Woods had smashed his car into a tree during what appeared to be a lover's spat.

Within days, stories about Woods cheating on Nordegren with dozens of strippers, waitresses, porn stars, lounge hostesses and groupies led to their divorce in mid-2010. 

The property features a large gym complete with state-of-the-art equipment 

The home's cozy theater comes complete with a private bar area 

A large-scale cellar was also included when the property was built back in 2012
