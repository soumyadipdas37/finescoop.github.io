She's at home asking the tough questions on The Project.

And on Sunday, Carrie Bickmore also proved she's got the moves on the dance floor in a throwback video of herself with daughter Evie.

Taking to Instagram, Carrie danced alongside her daughter while staying at a resort on the idyllic tropical island of Fiji. 

She's got the moves! The Project's Carrie Bickmore, 39, (pictured) showed off her 'daggy mum moves' in a sweet throwback clip with daughter Evie in Fiji

Carrie and little Evie were quiet the mother-and-daughter duo, with music playing in the background. 

 'Just a cool mum....doing a cool mum dance,' she wrote alongside the footage.

The blonde mother-of-three wore a red and white stripe skirt in the clip, along with a graphic grey t-shirt. 

 Evie really is a chip off the old block. In a photo shared to Instagram this month, the five-year-old looked exactly like her TV star mother.

So similar! Carrie's daughter Evie really is a chip off the old block. In a photo shared to Instagram this month, the five-year-old looked exactly like her TV star mother

The Project star posted the picture, which showed Evie beaming alongside her father Chris Walker.

With her cheeky smile, blonde hair and blue eyes, the tot is a dead ringer for her famous mum. 

Carrie added a simple heart emoji to caption the adorable photograph of her beloved daughter and husband.

Carrie shared Evie's latest pearls of wisdom this month, following Victorian Premier Dan Andrews' decision to implement Stage Four restrictions across the state. 

'Everyone knows it's the right thing,' Melbourne-based Carrie said during Monday's episode of The Project.

'As Evie, who's five, had the insight to say to [my son] Ollie, "He's just trying to keep us safe, Ollie, he's just trying to keep us safe",' she continued.    

The Project host revealed she had grand plans to mark the milestone 40th birthday in December, that she's now had to rethink because of the coronavirus pandemic.
