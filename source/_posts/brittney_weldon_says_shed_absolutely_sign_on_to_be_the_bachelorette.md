She failed to find love on the latest season of Bachelor in Paradise, but Brittney Weldon would 'absolutely' be open to being next year's Bachelorette.

'Hello, so many choices! It would be so good! Like, just to have your pick instead of being like, pick me!' the 26-year-old told Daily Mail Australia on Monday.

After unsuccessful stints on both Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor, Brittney confirmed she was still open to finding love on reality TV.

'Never say never. It just depends on what it was. I wouldn't really go on Bachelor in Paradise again without the chances of meeting someone,' she explained.

And while she hasn't been watching this year's season of The Bachelor because she's been busy moving into a new house, Brittney said she'd heard about the cattiness among the female contestants.

'I've seen a few things here and there, and I've been like, "Oh, wow! I'm glad I wasn't on that season,"' she said.

Tears and tantrums: While she hasn't seen this year's season of The Bachelor (pictured), Brittney confessed she's relieved there wasn't the same level of drama with the girls during her season in 2018

Brittney won sympathy from Bachelor in Paradise fans after revealing she had an unrequited crush on Jamie Doran, but she said they now have a 'good friendship'.

'I definitely wanted more from Jamie. But that's okay. We have a really good friendship now, and that's all that I can ask for,' she admitted.

'It's better than trying it out and then hating each other, so what we have now is great. We're friends for life.'

While her on-screen fling with Jackson Garlick didn't last, Brittney insisted they were 'absolutely still friends' and still 'talk occasionally'.

But she admitted that Bachelor in Paradise's resident bad boys, Timm Hanly and Ciarran Stott, may not have gone on the show for the right reasons.

'I think they were just guys on a lads' weekend, and they probably didn't realise the cameras were there all the time,' she said.

'They are nice guys, but I probably wouldn't have them as a boyfriend... I'm sure they were just there for some Fijian fun in the sun.'

The newly blonde reality star is currently promoting Pepsi Max's new Mango flavour, devising a winning razor hack to peel the popular summer fruit.

'I never win anything! Can you believe it? I was walking around the house, thinking, "What can I use? Wow, a razor! I've got this!"' she explained.

As for her current relationship status, the Bachelor 2018 star said she was still single, and is open to meeting people.

'I'm single at the moment, so if any boy wants to show me their mango hack, slide on in...' she laughed.

Pepsi Max Mango is available now in stores across Australia.
