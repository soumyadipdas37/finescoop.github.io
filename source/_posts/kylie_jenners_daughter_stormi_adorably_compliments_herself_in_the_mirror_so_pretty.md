Stormi looked quite stylish with her slicked back hair bun, Louis Vuitton handbag, and all-white outfit.

Proud mom Kylie gushed over her mother as she uploaded the short but sweet clip to her Instagram.

Back in May, Stormi won over Instagram viewers with a video demonstrating her incredible patience.

Kylie placed a bowl of M&Ms in front of the youngster and instructed her not to have any until she returned from the bathroom.

When her mother returned, the toddler helped herself to the candies.

'Kylie loves that she has so much time to bond with Stormi right now and spoil her with love and attention — they're both having so much fun together,' a source previously told Us Weekly.
