James Middleton has revealed he and fiancée Alizée Thevenet have been forced to postpone their wedding twice this summer amid the Covid-19 crisis in a gushing online post.

The Duchess of Cambridge's brother, 33, who is usually based in London but spent lockdown in Berkshire, where his parents live, shared a tribute to his future wife on Instagram yesterday. 

Posting a series of holiday pictures from a couple's getaway in Sicily, he wrote: 'It’s a year since I asked Alizée to marry me… what a year it’s been! Two homes, lockdown, two attempts at a wedding, a litter of puppies, launching of new company @ella.co, a beard shave, and much more.'

He continued: 'The best part is that I get to share it with you Alizée and I can’t wait to take on whatever the future holds for us.'

The entrepreneur revealed the couple have had 'two attempts at a wedding' during the coronavirus crisis  

The entrepreneur added: 'We managed to escape to Italy for a quick dip in the the sea, lots of wine and pasta and now ready to face the world again.'

Calling the yacht holiday an 'unforgettable experience', James also shared a number of snaps from the luxurious trip.

In the photographs, the couple could be seen relaxing on the deck of a lavish yacht, while James and Alizée also got behind the wheel of the boat.

The Duchess of Cambridge's brother announced his engagement to his French partner last October after he is believed to have proposed while in the Lake District. 

James revealed the couple had 'managed to escape to Italy' on a luxury yacht holiday, adding: they had enjoyed 'lots of wine and pasta' 

The 33-year-old revealed the couple have had 'two attempts at a wedding' in the year since he first proposed to his French partner 

The couple have been dating for just over two years now, and the pair were first spotted together at a Middleton family holiday in St. Bart's over Christmas 2018.

The entrepreneur, who runs personalised greeting card company Boomf, met the 30-year-old City worker in 2018.

A friend revealed Miss Thevenet did not know who Mr Middleton was when they started talking at the South Kensington Club after she said hello to his Cocker Spaniel Ella.  

According to Miss Thevenet's father, Jean-Gabriel Thevenet, she was won over by Mr Middleton's British charm and is 'deliriously happy' with the businessman.  

The couple, who first announced their engagement last October, jetted off to Sicily for the lavish holiday

Miss Thevenet is a keen skier who speaks four languages, helped by growing up in Chile, Indonesia and Belgium.

She moved to Britain six years ago and has a masters degree in investment and finance from Queen Mary University of London.

James latest post comes after he revealed that he also treated his French financier partner, who he proposed to in October 2019, to a philanthropic gift - having bought her a piece from a jewellery collection which benefits the Save the Children’s COVID-19 Emergency Response.

The entrepreneur shared a snap of his fiancee with one of their pooches, showcasing the romantic setup he'd delivered - which included plenty of vibrant coloured flowers and beverages.

Alizee sported a dazzling necklace teamed with a blue, patterned maxi dress, while James opted for a low-key trouser look complete with colourful slippers.

Sharing a video and photographs from their date night, James wrote yesterday: 'Alizee and I haven’t been on a date for ages….so I decided to surprise her with a little picnic with the dogs and a special little gift.

'I was looking for something special and I discovered the @bulgari @savethechildren jewellery collection where a proportion of each sale in the UK goes directly to Save the Children’s COVID-19 Emergency Response.

'Save the Children is an amazing UK charity doing life-saving work across the world and I’m proud to support @bulgari who have raised around $100million for @savethechildren.'
