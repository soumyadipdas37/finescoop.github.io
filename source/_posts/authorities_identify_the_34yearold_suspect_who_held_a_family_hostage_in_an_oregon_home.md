Deputies arrived at the house in Juneva Place SE at 12.30pm after reports of the potentially dangerous situation

Deputies arrived at the house on the 200 block of Juneva Place SE at 12.30pm after reports of the potentially dangerous situation.

After deputies from the Marion County Sheriff's Office arrived, a negotiator started talking with the suspect inside.

But as the trained hostage negotiator was dealing with the suspect, shots were fired. 

The sheriff's office said: 'Ultimately, there were multiple fatalities during this incident, including that of the suspect.'

Police have not released the identity of the minors who were at the home 

They confirmed no officers were injured in the shooting.  

Neighbor Katie O'Kelley told CNN: 'I heard three shots and then within five minutes I heard a bang.

'I heard sirens when the ambulances were coming in, they loaded three different people I could see, one right outside my house. It was pretty scary.'

Brian Johnson, another local resident, said: 'It's kind of scary, I know the world's turning into a different direction. There's a lot of children and families around here so it's disturbing.'

Local resident Brian Johnson said he found the incident 'disturbing' as there are lots of families and young children living nearby

Mahrt Avenue SE was closed between Lancaster Drive SE and Roggy Court SE for multiple hours during the investigation.
