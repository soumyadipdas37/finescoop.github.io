Barclays boss Jes Staley is facing fresh calls to resign after he was dragged into efforts to hunt down the wealth of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

Authorities in the US Virgin Islands have ordered JP Morgan, Staley's former employer, to hand over the banker's communications with paedophile Epstein. 

Increasing pressure: Barclays boss Jes Staley is facing fresh calls to resign

The renewed scrutiny has prompted activist investor Edward Bramson to renew efforts to remove the banker.

In a letter sent to investors in his fund, Sherborne Investors, Bramson said: 'The kindest thing the board could do for him would be to let him go'. 

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on Staley's part.
