An Australian has been arrested in Bali after allegedly being found with drugs in his plush villa.

Davy Shane Cristian, 46, was allegedly found in possession of 0.19g of marijuana, 0.42g of purple powder, believed to be ecstasy, and a bong.

Cristian, from Perth, was arrested after Indonesian police raided his accommodation in the exclusive district of Tabanan before allegedly seizing illegal substances.

Deputy of Narcotic directorate Puti Yuni Setiawan explained that the authorities were awaiting results of Cristian's urine test before making him a suspect. 

'Police found a plastic clip containing purple powder suspected as being ecstasy and in a wardrobe police found a paper rolled with leaves and seed that is suspected of containing marijuana,' he told The West Australian.

'There was also equipment that can be used as a bong for inhaling smoke from marijuana and to inhale meth.'

Cristian will face 12 years in jail if he is found guilty of drug possession.

On Tuesday, Aaron Wayne Coyle, 44, who is also from Perth, was arrested after police allegedly found 11.8g of methamphetamine and 15 ecstasy pills.

Coyle faces a maximum 20 years behind bars if he is found guilty. 

Indonesian officers allege Coyle was working for 32-year-old British man Collum Park.  

Indonesia has very strict drug laws and convicted traffickers are often executed by a firing squad.

More than 150 people are on death row, mostly for drug crimes, and about a third of them are foreigners.
