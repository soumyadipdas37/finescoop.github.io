A French villa in a picturesque town where numerous movies have been filmed has gone on sale for £6.2million.

The classical home is in the town of Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Cote d'Azur.

For years its old town has attracted film directors as a natural movie set and welcomed stars such as Errol Flynn to take residence there.

Films recorded in the stunning bay include the James Bond movie Never Say Never Again, The Adventures of Captain Fabian with Errol Flynn, The Jewel of the Nile, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Ronin and Absolutely Fabulous.

The home, which has four bedrooms (one pictured), is close to the former home of Hollywood star Errol Flynn 

Pictured: The villa was built in the Belle Epoque era (1880-1914) and has around 3,200 sq ft of living space

The four-bedroom house has two guest houses and an outdoor swimming pool.

It looks out towards the iconic Villa Nellcôte, the house rented by Rolling Stones lead guitarist Keith Richards, during the early 1970s, where he wrote and the band recorded part of their seminal album, Exile on Main St.

The new owner will acquire a villa laid out over three floors whose features represent its classic design; with double doorways, ornate cornicing, elegant marble hallways, stylish bay windows and a balustraded balcony.

Visitors arrive through wrought iron double doors into a marble tiled entrance hall.

There is a large salon with double glass doors leading to the front terrace and the sea views with views towards Cap Ferrat.

The dining room also has doors to the terrace and sea views and there is a kitchen which has its own doors to a large covered rear terrace.

Upstairs there are four bedrooms on the first and second floor of the villa.. Each has a sea view and its own balcony.

Stairs lead up to the second floor and the roof terrace which has spectacular coastal views.

The villa's new owner will also acquire two separate properties in the grounds, including one which is built like a mini version of the main house.

Dan Norris, of Leggett Prestige estate agents in France, described the villa as 'perfect'.

Norris said: 'It is actually stunning, there is no other word for it. It's in the so-called Golden Triangle between Nice and Monaco and looks out over one of the most perfect bays in France'

He said: 'It is actually stunning, there is no other word for it. It's in the so-called Golden Triangle between Nice and Monaco and looks out over one of the most perfect bays in France.

'The owners fell in love with it and felt they had to have it. Now they are a little older they want to reduce their responsibilities and downsize their commitments.'

Mr Norris believes that despite its grandeur, the villa has a 'warm and homely feel' and would suit a family who wanted a spacious property close to the beach and with its own pool.

He said: 'However, it could equally work for someone who was commercially minded and wanted to rent it out.'
