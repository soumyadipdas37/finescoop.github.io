Bella Varelis is one of the front-runners to steal Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor.

But it appears a certain man already won her affection years before she met the thrill-seeking Australian Survivor star.

Bella's Twitter account from 2010 resurfaced this week, and her old tweets include several odes to teen heart-throb Justin Bieber.

How embarrassing! The Bachelor star Bella Varelis' cringeworthy Twitter account resurfaced this week - and she appeared to have a bad case of Bieber fever in the early 2000s

Bella, who was 15 years old when she posted the tweets, appeared to have a bad case of Bieber fever in the early 2000s.

'You are absolutely amazing just listened to ur 2day fm radio interview! I CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH AND SMILEE :) <3 come back !!' she tweeted at the pop star.

The teenage fangirl didn't stop there, and even begged Justin to follow her back.

'I CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH!!' Bella, who was 15 years old when she posted the tweets, shared several posts dedicated to pop star Justin Bieber. Pictured: her Twitter profile picture

She wrote: 'YOU ARE FREAKING AMAZING but it sucks cUse your not following me :( HOW DO I MAKE YOU FOLLOW MEE !! bahaha :( '

Another tweet read: 'BAHAHAHHA your perfect !!! Veerry niceeee (borat voice).'

The resurfaced tweets come after Bella had a meltdown on The Bachelor last week.

Back in the day: Justin Bieber (pictured in Las Vegan on December 31, 2009) was a teen heart-throb in the early 2000s, but his music has since matured and he now has an older fan base

She snapped at Irena Srbinovska at the cocktail party, after learning that the nurse had been speaking to Locky every day while the show was in lockdown. 

'I actually can't f**king deal with this to be honest,' Bella yelled. 'Irena, I don't trust you anymore.'

A defiant Irena responded: 'I don't trust you.'

'Then great, friendship done,' Bella declared as she stormed off.

A source told Daily Mail Australia this week that Bella lost her temper because she'd been under the impression that she was the only woman who was having 'lengthy' conversations with Locky during lockdown.

'Bella was convinced that she was the only one who spoke to Locky at length during the filming break,' the insider said.

'So the real reason they fell out was that Bella couldn't accept the fact that Irena had also formed a close connection.

'She was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close.' 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10

Jealous much? She snapped at Irena Srbinovska at the cocktail party, after learning that the nurse had been speaking to Locky every day while the show was in lockdown
