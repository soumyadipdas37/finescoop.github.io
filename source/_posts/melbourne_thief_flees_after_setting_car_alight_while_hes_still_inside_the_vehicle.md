A hapless thief accused of torching a stolen car while he was still inside it has gone on the run after suffering serious burns in the bizarre incident, as vision shows the car busting into flames.

Detectives have released footage of the crime captured on CCTV in inner-city Melbourne last month in the hope of tracking down the alleged thief and his accomplice. 

Police said the 2016 Toyota 86 model was stolen from Lalor sometime between 10am and 8.45pm on August 4 and driven to Little Miller Street, a dead-end street 13km away in Brunswick East.

CCTV shows the thief lighting up a cigarette in the rain and appears to throws it in the car while still lit.

He then goes to passenger seat side, where he's joined by a second man arriving at the scene.

The thief leans inside the car to set it alight with an accelerant, which erupts into a fiery explosion seconds later with half of his body still inside.

Police suspect he may have been injured at the time of setting the car alight at around 9.10pm.

Despite his suspected injuries, he and his accomplice make a hasty exit.

The pair were last seen running towards nearby Balfe Park, where police believed they left the scene in another vehicle.

'If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned,' Victoria Police captioned CCTV footage on Facebook.

The footage also sparked a few laughs on the 3AW breakfast program on Wednesday. 

 'Oh my goodness, what an idiot!' one of the hosts said.

The police spokesman replied: I don't know what's more stupid- the way he's set it on fire or the fact he's parked under a CCTV camera.'

Police believe the thief's male accomplice travelled independently to the location.   

The thief is described as thin to medium build, aged early to mid-20s, has short dark hair and a short beard.

He was wearing a cap, down jacket which was possibly blue in colour, skinny leg tracksuit pants and sneakers.

The other man is described as medium build, is aged in his mid-20s and was wearing a waterproof style jacked, a cap, long pants, sneakers and had the hood of the jacket up over his head. 

Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
