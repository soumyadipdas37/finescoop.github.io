Meanwhile Vicky Pattison commented 'Congrats you beautiful girl' while Lottie Tomlinson wrote 'Congratulations' along with a love heart.

Nicola quit Made In Chelsea at the end of 2016 after more than a year on the show, following the breakdown of her romance with Alex Mytton.  

The former couple were an item for two years, after meeting in August 2014 while he was DJing in Ireland.

However, Nicola, who was once romantically linked to Cheryl's ex-husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, was left heartbroken when he ended their romance via text, while she was enjoying a family holiday in Florence, Italy.

'In extreme cases, when I broke up with my ex, I took tablets to calm me down. Or if I'm travelling I take some stuff to calm me down. I'm a really bad traveller – planes, tubes, sometimes in taxis. I don't like being in any confined space.

'I go to events regularly and they can make me panicky because I'm surrounded by loads of people. So, it's weird the job I do because I do suffer from that really badly.'
