Trevor Noah and Minka Kelly appeared to confirm their romance as they were seen arriving at the Daily Show host's New York City apartment this week.

Pictured together on Wednesday, the 40-year-old actress was seen with several pieces of luggage, as Trevor, 36, followed her into the lobby of his building bringing with him Minka's dog.

The stars have yet to comment on reports earlier this week that they're in a serious relationship.

But they certainly looked comfortable in each other's company as they hopped out of a black SUV in Manhattan.

The South African-born comedian wore a grey hoodie and jeans along with a patterned face mask as he helped the brunette beauty with her luggage.

Minka opted for a comfy casual look in grey sweatpants and a white t-shirt.

The Titans star appeared to be ready to stay for a long weekend with a suitcase, a holdall and backpack.

Romance blooming? The photos come as it was reported earlier this week that Trevor and Minka are in 'a very serious relationship.'

An insider told People Monday that the TV host and actress are 'very happy' with one another.

The stars have yet to confirm they're a couple.

Minka has past been in high-profile romances with actors Chris Evans, Wilmer Valderrama, Jesse Williams and baseball icon Derek Jeter.

Trevor's most recent romance came with model Jordyn Taylor in 2017, and he was linked to South African physiotherapist Dani Gabriel prior to that.

The Daily Show host has remained a steadfast presence on TV amid the pandemic and George Floyd killing and aftermath, offering up his takes on social and political issues.

In May, he talked about the video of the Floyd killing, in which ex-police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter.

'I don't know what made that video more painful for people to watch,' he said. 'The fact that that man was having his life taken in front of our eyes, the fact that we were watching someone being murdered by someone whose job is to protect and serve, or the fact that he seemed so calm doing it.

'There was a black man, on the ground, in handcuffs, and you could take his life, so you did. Almost knowing that there would be no ramifications.'

The Friday Night Lights star has focused her efforts on animal rights, making headlines when she asked a Myrtle Beach, South Carolina zoo to release a tiger named Lyla into a wildlife sanctuary amid ongoing health struggles for the animal.

'I understand that Waccatee Zoo visitors have documented Lila’s worsening condition, how she incessantly licks at her bare skin and stands in a hunched posture inside her cramped cage,' Minka said in a letter to zoo owners Kathleen and Jeff Futrell published on Page Six last month. 

She added: 'Lila clearly needs immediate help. Please, accept PETA’s offer and let her be transferred to an accredited sanctuary without further delay.'
