Kool & the Gang grew from jazz roots in the 1960s to become one of the major groups of the 1970s, blending jazz, funk, R&B and pop.

He penned their only Billboard Hot 100 number one, Celebration, and their top 10 hits Get Down on It, Ladies Night, Hollywood Swinging and Jungle Boogie. 

'At the end of Ladies Night, we are singing, "Come on let’s all celebrate,"' Bell told Billboard in 2018 of the hit's origins. 'So Celebration comes from the end of Ladies Night,'

Adding: 'But I actually saw that in a scripture I was reading where the creator of the universe that created man and the angels were all celebrating for doing so, and from that idea it sparked writing Celebration.'

Bell was a member of the group since 1964 alongside his brother Ronald Bell, Amir Bayyan, Curtis Williams, Dennis Thomas, George Brown, Lavell Evan, Louis Taylor, Shawn McQuiller, Timothy Horton and Michael Ray.
