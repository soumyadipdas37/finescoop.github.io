A young surfer who was savagely mauled by a five metre great white shark has jumped back into the water just months after the terrifying ordeal. 

Phil Mummert, 28, was surfing at Bunker Bay, south of Perth, when the huge shark bit his right thigh and took a chunk off his surfboard on July 31. 

He was left with a large gnash about 150mm deep where the shark's teeth penetrated through his skin. 

His girlfriend Mish Wright shared a heartwarming photo of them together, announcing that Mr Mummert is finally back into the water after the incident.

'It's not easy getting back in the ocean after being attacked by a five metre Great White,' she captioned the photo.

'Splashing around in the shallow end of the Ningaloo reef is probably the best way to do it.' 

Ms Wright previously shared a photo of Mr Mummert smiling in a hospital bed following his encounter with the great white, thanking those who came to his rescue. 

'I honestly don't know how a person can see a total stranger getting attacked by a four-metre great white shark and swim towards to save him so we are beyond grateful to everyone that helped save Phil's life,' she wrote.

'So lucky that Phil got away with his life and limbs and beyond lucky that we live in such a kind and caring community.

'So thankful for everyone who carried him to shore and for the ones that held his leg together for half an hour while waiting for the ambulance.

'Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,' she said.

One of Mr Mummert's rescuers recounted how quickly the brutal attack unfolded.

'He's just sitting on his board and the next thing you know we just heard someone go 'shark',' he said. 

'I turned around and I've just seen this white (shark) kind of breach and it had already smashed, hit Phil.

'It just obliterated his board, it was just floating there like icicles.'

The five-metre great white shark also bit Mr Mummert's board in half (pictured) during the attack on July 31

Another surfer who came to Mr Mummert's aid, Jess Woolhouse, said it was a 'life or death' situation.

'We all sort of made an effort to get him onto the board and start heading in just sort of yelling and trying to splash the water,' he explained.

Mr Woolhouse said a group of six or seven people had also formed on the beach and it was a community effort to help Mr Mummert to shore.

He explained Mr Mummert was in good spirits and his bleeding had slowed down before he was taken to hospital.
