There was the grand total of three spectators huddled inside the Court Suzanne Lenglen to watch Jo Konta play Coco Gauff, and at times that seemed to be three more than the match deserved.

With only 1,000 spectators on the ground they were thinly spread, and this French Open first round really was one to miss, a contest of excruciatingly poor quality for two talented players.

Somebody had to win before it was put out of its misery, and that was the 16 year-old American, who clocked up her first main draw win at Roland Garros by knocking out the British number one 6-3 6-3.

Konta had an outstanding year in the Grand Slams last season, the highlight of which was making the semi-finals in Paris. The only thing she has to show for her attempts at the Majors in this horribly blighted year will be a victory over Heather Watson at the US Open.

Try her best as she always does, this was a truly awful display against an over-hyped player whose own shortcomings were also evident, albeit in the uncomfortably cold conditions that prevailed.

The match reached its nadir in the ninth game as Gauff attempted to serve the first set out. She gifted Konta two break points through double faults, and then served doubles again on two of her six set points.

But it was a truly awful display from Konta who followed Andy Murray in exiting the major

Neither player seemed capable of finishing it, and when the young American clinched the set through a missed return she shouted 'Finally!'

In all Gauff served twelve double faults, while Konta contributed 41 unforced errors. It was hard to credit you were watching the same British player who so brilliantly demolished Sloane Stephens in the quarter finals of 2019.

'It was difficult for everyone all day, so that wasn't specific to me. I think it's going to be probably a difficult fortnight with the forecast,' said Konta. ' In terms of the match itself, unfortunately I just didn't play very well.

'I'm not pleased. I would like to do better, but I'm not exactly going to hate myself.'

Konta, who has carved out such an admirable career for herself after modest beginnings, will at least not lose the ranking points of last year's semi-final, with these kept on for two years due to the lack of tournaments.

The only place she can now play is the lone remaining WTA Tour event in Ostrava in the Czech Republic, next month. Such is the dependence of the women's tour on China that there is nothing else to play, with all events in the Far East cancelled.
