They have been happily dating since his split from his second wife Melanie Griffith in 2014, and are isolating together in Madrid amid the coronavirus crisis.

And Antonio Banderas looked smitten as he stepped out with girlfriend Nicole Kimpel in the Spanish capital on Saturday.

The actor, 60, put on a loved-up display with the Dutch investment adviser, 38, as they held hands while enjoying a stroll.

Antonio put on a casual display in a black biker jacket, which he paired with a navy blue shirt and a pair of black-and-white trainers. 

Nicole, meanwhile, looked sensational in a red blazer that she slipped on over a black logo t-shirt and form-fitting jeans.

Her blonde locks were brushed into a sleek, straight style and she accessorised with a pair of chic round shades.

The couple made sure to keep safe amid the coronavirus crisis, as they both wore black masks during their outing.

In June, Antonio revealed he  still speaks to his ex-wife Melanie all the time and says she will always be part of his 'family'.

Although the former couple divorced in 2015, they have remained close and Antonio says Melanie, 63, will always be part of his life because they shared so many 'wonderful years' and have their 'wonderful daughter' Stella, 24, together.

'I think we are both reluctant to bury 20 years of marriage,' he said on El Break de las 7. 'We are human beings, we make mistakes and that is the human condition.'

The Zorro actor added, 'You have to leave the egos aside and not want to prove that you are right or find who's guilty of what.

'Because it may be both or neither of you. There is a moment when things are over and you have to accept it.

'The life I had with Melanie was beautiful,' said the actor who fell for the daughter of Tippi Hedren of The Birds fame when they co-starred in the 1996 movie Two Much with Daryl Hannah.

'We had 20 wonderful years during which we gave our best and lived wonderful moments that I will not forget,' added the star who welcomed daughter Stella, now 23, with Melanie in September 1996.

'We had a wonderful daughter that we both love and that is the end result of our relationship, the most beautiful thing we have ever done together.'

Melanie has two other children, daughter Dakota, 30, with Don Johnson and son Alexander, 34, with Steven Bauer. 

Antonio - who married the Working Girl star in 1996 - insists he is still very close to his stepchildren and they are still a big part of his life.

The Spanish hunk is pleased that he and Melanie have been able to maintain a friendly relationship for the sake of the children, even though they are all adults.

He said: 'Our children, all of them, are very grateful we manage to do it all in a civil manner'.
