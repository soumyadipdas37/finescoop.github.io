The episode opened with the fight which exploded during a wine tasting event for Gizelle Bryant's recent literary award.

Candiace, 33, asked Monique 'You gon' drag me? to which Monique responded. 'Do you want me to?' before launching herself at her costar and grabbing her wig before pulling her across the table.

'You keep talking. You literally want someone to hit you, so that's what happened,' she said while accusing Candiace of 'baiting her'.

Monique then tried to break free from the room to go back and confront Candiace who was being helped into a car by another producer.

'Please don't do this,' the producer pleaded with Monique but she kept storming towards where the rest of the cast were.

'I'm going to beat her a**. She's been asking for it since last year,' Monique said as she ran outside to where Candiace was waiting for her ride.

When she spotted Candiace leaving Monique sprinted over but was intercepted by another member of the crew.

'She's gone! She's gone,' the producer told Monique of Candiace.

Monique was still in fight mode however, as she went back inside and told the rest of the cast, including Gizelle, Karen, Wendy, Robyn Dixon and Ashley Darby, to not 'bring Candiace around me.'

After the incident Monique called her husband Chris and explained what happened.

'Hey baby, I just got into a fight with Candiace. The last thing I remember is me flipping her hair and next thing I know, a glass flew and I grabbed her weave and was just bashing her head with my fist. I honestly blacked out after that,

'That's embarrassing' he replied, sounding disappointed.

'I really don't care. She eggs people on,' Monique replied.

Injured: Monique had a bloodied lip after the fight

'I'm going to beat her a**. She's been asking for it since last year,' Monique said as she ran outside to where Candiace was waiting for her ride

Hey: Candiace got in the car and phoned her husband to tell him what happened

On Sunday night Monique tweeted 'The blessing of experiencing lows means there’s no where to go but UP! Keep watching to see the entire journey. I’m grateful for my ups and my downs because they help me grow. I’ll continue to look for the positives wrapped within the negatives and move forward #RHOP'

The duo's falling out began when Monique said she felt disrespected by Candiace at her lake house.

During last week's episode. Candiace had pulled Gizelle and Ashley away from the group for a chat about Ashley's husband and the cheating rumors about him.

Candiace defended her decision to have the conversation in private but Monique wasn't having it, telling her 'It's about being considerate.'

Monique also believes that former Housewife Charisse Jordan Jackson, who Candiace is friends with and also invited her to a party, started a rumor that she had an inappropriate relationship with her fitness trainer. Monique denied the affair and Jordan Jackson has denied spreading the rumor.
