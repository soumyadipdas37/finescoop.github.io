Summer is over and after months off school, parents across the country are preparing for their kids to go back to school.

Frankie Bridge revealed that her youngest son Carter, five, was back in the classroom on Tuesday, while other celeb mums spent the day getting uniform ironed, labels sewn and packed lunches prepped ready for the start of term on Wednesday. 

With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to school closures in March and forcing most students into home schooling, Frankie echoed the thoughts of many as she said the start of school 'feels like a big step back towards normality.'

'Little Legs is back to school... he’s very nervous about how he’s going to make friends... but I know this is totally what he needs and he will be absolutely fine ❤️' she wrote in the caption.

'It feels like a new start today... like a big step back towards normality ☀️ go shine bright little man! #backtoschool #newbeginnings.'

Other celeb families were making the most of their final day at home, with Stacey Solomon telling her followers she was keeping busy ironing uniforms and spending quality time with her eldest sons Zachary, 11 and Leighton, eight, before the rush on Wednesday.

'Today I'm going to check my school lists a thousands times, make sure I've got everything and be with the boys as much as I can before they're back in the school routine,' Stacey told her followers. 

She later showed a photo of her sons' school uniform hanging up as she joked 'my morning so far...half way there, I HATE ironing! I'm only doing their shirts but bring on the winter because as soon as it gets cold they're wearing jumpers over the top and bye bye ironing.'
