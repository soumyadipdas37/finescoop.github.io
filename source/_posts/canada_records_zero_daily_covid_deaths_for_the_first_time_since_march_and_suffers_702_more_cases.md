Canada has reported zero daily Covid-19 deaths for the first time since March 15, according to public health agency data released late on Friday.

Canada's death toll remained at 9,163 as of September 11, the same as the number of deaths reported the day before, government data shows. 

The number of positive cases of coronavirus rose by 702 from the previous day, standing at 135,626 on September 11.

It comes as most provinces in Canada are easing lockdown restrictions and schools are beginning to reopen for in-person classes. 

Canada's infection figures saw a mild increase in recent days, with authorities on high alert to avoid new outbreaks of Covid.

Some provinces, including British Columbia, even imposed new curbs to tackle the spread of the virus amid the uptake. 

But across the border in the United States, more than 190,000 people have died from the pandemic and more than 6.38million people have been infected.

Canada's first recorded case of coronavirus was in Toronto on January 25.

Both Ontario, the country's most populous province, and neighbouring Quebec turned into the hot spots for COVID-19 infections.

The provinces both struggles with outbreaks in long-term care homes, with Canada's first death from Covid being reported on March 9 at a British Columbia long-term care facility.

But Canada's experience dealing with SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2002-2003 helped health officials to be better prepared for the pandemic.

SARS killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that outbreak.

Canada shut its international borders to all foreign nationals and ramped up tests to isolate infected patients when Covid cases began to spike in mid-March.  

Ontario and Alberta faced outbreaks among temporary foreign workers on farms and meat-processing plants, which slowed reopening in certain regions.
