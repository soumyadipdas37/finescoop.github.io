A homeless black man shot dead by California police on Wednesday is a father-of-two, former bodybuilder who fell on hard times, DailyMail.com can reveal. 

Family photos posted on Facebook show Kurt Reinhold, 42, smiling and hugging his elementary school-age son and daughter. 

Reinhold was killed during a struggle with two Orange County Sheriff's Department deputies in San Clemente that was caught on camera on Wednesday. 

The killing sparked protests on Thursday against police brutality which led to the city council imposing a curfew. 

Police said Reinhold was homeless and had moved to the Southern California town from nearby Los Angeles in the past month.

It's unclear how the once happy Reinhold ended up in the streets. Photos posted on his Facebook page show happier, more prosperous days. The son of an elementary school teacher posted pictures of himself in 2015 dressed in a suit on a date with his children's mother at the Hollywood Pantages Theater where they saw a performance of Riverdance 2.

Reinhold, who can be seen smiling in a photo with his two elementary school-aged children, moved from Los Angeles to San Clemente two months ago

In another picture he posed in front of a black Mercedes car, and also shared family photos with the mother, Latoya Courtney, on holiday in Aruba in 2016. 

Reinhold's family, seen hugging each other next to Black Lives Matter signs on the lawn outside their home in Los Angeles on Friday, declined to comment. 

A neighbor told DailyMail.com Reinhold was a 'lovely man' and said they were devastated that the shooting left his two children without a father. The father-of-two was religious, describing himself online as an 'Apostolic Christian'. 

It is not clear whether he was still in a relationship with his kids' mother Latoya, an LA-based nurse practitioner from St Louis, Missouri.

Witnesses claimed that the deputies approached and stopped Reinhold, a homeless man in San Clemente, for 'jaywalking'

Witnesses said the two officers stopped Reinhold for jaywalking, though Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes did not confirm the claims. 

A bystander caught the man's altercation with two officers on camera, showing the 42-year-old stood in the middle of South El Camino Real outside the Miramar Hotel, shouting at the cops 'Don't touch me', while they told him to sit on the sidewalk. 

After batting away the officers' outstretched hands and saying 'Where did I jaywalk? Why did you stop me?' while walking towards them, the two deputies tackled Reinhold to the ground and struggled with him. 

Vehicles driving along the street block the camera´s view of the struggle as one shot rings out, then another about five seconds later. The sounds of sirens wail the background.

Sheriff Barnes said the grainy photo released by the Orange County Sheriff's Department showed Reinhold reaching for one deputy's weapon, though the sheriff said it's not clear if he was able to get it out. 

Video from a witness recorded a deputy yelling 'he's got my gun!' four times during the altercation. But Barnes declined to release any video, saying he didn't want to influence witnesses who had yet to be interviewed by investigators. 

He also said he didn't yet know why the two veteran officers on the department's homeless outreach unit tried to stop Reinhold on the street. Police made multiple attempts to get him help but he declined, Barnes said. 

The two deputies are eight- and 13-year veterans who are part of a 25-member unit that attempts to engage with the homeless people and get them into service programs for mental health, drug addiction or other issues. 

They are trained in de-escalation and crisis intervention. Barnes said deputies are taught to try to gain compliance without violence. 

He said the tackling of Reinhold was 'not something we want to see happen.' The deputies have been placed on leave and the Orange County district attorney is investigating.

On Thursday morning, about 50 people protested Reinhold's killing and tried to block traffic in San Clemente, about 60 miles south of LA

On Thursday morning, about 50 people protested Reinhold's killing and tried to block traffic in San Clemente, about 60 miles south of LA . 

Four were arrested after they refused to get out of the street and a fifth was booked on a vandalism charge for scratching a sheriff's vehicle, Barnes said.

Barnes acknowledged Reinhold´s death came at a tenuous time for the country.

'Given the current climate of police and community relations, I understand that this conversation is going to be a difficult one around this incident,' he said at a news conference.

'However, it is vitally important that we reserve judgement until a full and complete investigation has been complete by the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

'We will protect the First Amendment rights of those who want to publicly mourn Mr. Reinhold. What we as a community should not tolerate is commentary or action that serves to divide. 

'Spreading rumors and misinformation about the identity of the decedent or the reason he was he was contact by deputies is irresponsible and dangerous.'
