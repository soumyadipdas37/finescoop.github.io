Six months after they were forced to shut down because of coronavirus, filming is set to resume for Baz Luhrmann and wife Catherine Martin's Elvis biopic.

And on Monday, it was back to business for Catherine, who was spotted on the Gold Coast set of the film.

As always, the 55-year-old multiple Academy-award winning costume designer stood out in a matching animal print ensemble.

Although she wasn't wearing it, Catherine had a surgical mask ready to go, on a chain that was also wrapped around her neck. 

She looked chic in a casual leopard print T-shirt and denim jeans. 

The mother-of-two also wore animal print sneakers and a matching jacket which she carried around the open film set.

At one point Catherine was seen making her way over to several crew members. 

In a statement to the media last Thursday, it was announced the star-studded production would resume filming on September 23. 

The musical drama details the life of legendary rockstar Elvis Presley, with American actor Austin Butler set to star as the icon.

Tom Hanks will star as Elvis' notorious manager, Colonel Tom Parker, while Australian actress Olivia DeJonge will feature as Priscilla Presley.

Production was forced to close back in March, after Tom, 64, and his wife of 32 years, Rita Wilson, both contracted coronavirus.

In a statement last Thursday, Baz, 57, said he was looking forward to finally getting back to work on the blockbuster.

 'We're back to, as Elvis liked to say, "taking care of business!"' he began. 

'It is a real privilege in this unprecedented global moment that Tom Hanks has been able to return to Australia to join Austin Butler and all of our extraordinary cast and crew to commence production on "Elvis". 

'I cannot emphasise enough how lucky we feel in the current climate that the state of Queensland, and Queenslanders in general, have been so supportive of this film.'

Baz is the director, a writer and a producer on the film, while Catherine also acts as one of the producers.
