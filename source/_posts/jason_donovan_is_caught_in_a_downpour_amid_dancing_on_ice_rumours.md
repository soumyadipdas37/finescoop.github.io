He has so far stayed mum on rumours that he is set to join the cast of the upcoming series of hit ITV competition Dancing On Ice.

But Jason Donovan had more bothersome matters on his mind on Wednesday, when he was spotted getting caught in the rain during a solo stroll through London.

The 52-year-old actor looked decidedly unimpressed as he was caught in the downpour, signalling the end of the capital's unseasonably balmy weather.

Rain, rain, go away: Jason Donovan was spotted getting caught in the rain during a solo stroll through London on Wednesday, amid rumours he's set to compete on Dancing On Ice

The former Neighbours star was seen looking looking at properties in an estate agent's window, before he attempted to run for cover amid the torrential rain.

Australian actor Jason looked casually cool for the solo outing, donning a baggy light grey sweater with black shorts, which he teamed with white running shoes. 

Jason was spotted last week with a gash on his forehead amid rumours he is set to star in the 2021 series of Dancing On Ice.

The former Neighbours heartthrob - who competed on Strictly Come Dancing in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the show when it airs in January.

A source told The Sun: 'Jason is a great signing for the show as he has plenty of star power.

'He knows how to dance but if he thinks it’ll be any help once he’s on the ice he has another thing coming. 

'He’s hoping to rank higher in this show than he did on Strictly, he just needs to find out if he can stay upright once he has his skates on.'

MailOnline has contacted Jason's representatives for comment. 

Show: Myleene Klass was the first to confirm that she would be appearing on the show in 2021

So far, Denise Van Outen, Myleene Klass, and Emmerdale's Joe Warren Plant are among the first celebrities to have been confirmed for the series.

Myleene confirmed her participation at the start of the week, telling her Instagram followers: 'Guess who won’t be holding the coats at the side of the rink anymore!

'I am so, SO excited to be joining the cast of @dancingonice. My girls have always wanted me to do this but I’ve always been too scared someone will skate over my fingers!

Anyway, I want to make them proud and show them I’m up for a challenge when completely out of my comfort zone but most of all, I want a bum like Jlo!'
