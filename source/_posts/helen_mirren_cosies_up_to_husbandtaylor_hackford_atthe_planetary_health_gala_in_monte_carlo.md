They've been married since 1997.

And Helen Mirren and husband Taylor Hackford, both 75, were the picture of happiness as they walked the blue carpet at the 2020 Monte Carlo Gala for Planetary Health on Thursday.

The Oscar winner exuded elegance in a beautiful forest green gown as she posed alongside her dapper spouse for the star-studded event.

Helen made a glamorous arrival for the occasion in a deep green gown with an asymmetrical neckline and frilled skirt.

The Queen star teamed the piece with a chunky silver necklace and her grey tresses swept into a voluminous u-pdo.

Hosted by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the gala gathers leading philanthropists, talents and scientists to join forces and launch the charity's initiatives to bridge the widening gap between health and the environment. 

The 2020 Monte-Carlo Gala for Planetary Health aims to highlight the idea that our future is dependent on healthy ecosystems.

Hosted by the Prince’s foundation, it has gathered talents, philanthropists, decision makers and scientists to discuss the challenges the planet’s environment faces.

The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.

Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.  

However it's likely this year's event has seen drastic changes to ensure social distancing can be adhered to, with many stars also donning masks as they arrived on the blue carpet. 

Important: Due to the current COVID-19 crisis, Helen ensured she had her matching face mask close to hand as she arrived for the gala
