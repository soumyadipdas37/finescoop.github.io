Charli XCX obtained a temporary restraining order Wednesday against an allegedly obsessed fan who broke into her Los Angeles home and got naked.

The 28-year-old English singer claimed the Wisconsin man tried to visit her twice last week and during his second trip stripped down, jumped in her hot tub and strolled around her bedroom, according to an article by TMZ.

Charli, real name Charlotte Emma Aitchison, in her filing seeking the court order claimed the man has sent her hundreds of disturbing messages on social media.

He allegedly went to her Los Angeles home on August 24 and 25 with security footage capturing him on video.

Charli was not at home when the man allegedly broke in, according to court documents.

The temporary restraining order requires the man to stay at least 100 yards away from the singer, her car, her job and her home.

The court-ordered protection was granted as Charli put her 1920s home in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles up for sale.
