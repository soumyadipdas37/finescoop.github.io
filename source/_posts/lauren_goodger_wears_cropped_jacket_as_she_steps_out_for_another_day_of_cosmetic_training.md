She's been brushing up on her beauty skills after opening her own salon called Lauren's Way back in 2012.

And Lauren Goodger proved she's certainly eager to learn as she headed to beauty training centre Cosmetic Couture Clinic in Manchester for the second day in a row on Wednesday.  

The former TOWIE star, 33, cut a low-key figure as she styled a black cropped jacket with a chic maxi skirt.

Dressing up her outfit ever so slightly, the media personality's bottoms featured a knee-high slit to flash a hint of her legs.

The model kept comfy when it came to her footwear as she arrived at the centre in monochrome sock boots.

Earlier this month, Lauren revealed in New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame.

She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.

'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me. 

'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".' 

The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.

Lauren recently broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.

Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. 

Declaring she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she insisted she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.
