Justin Bieber stood out for all the wrong reasons on Tuesday afternoon as he made his latest appearance with wife Hailey. 

The Canadian singer, 26, wore a garish hot pink co-ord that inevitably caught the eye while visiting a friend's home in West Hollywood.  

With a brightly coloured sweater worn above a pair of matching sweat pants, Justin was hard to miss while idling outside the property with his model wife, shortly after the couple celebrated their second wedding anniversary.

The star added to his look with a pair of highly distinctive YEEZY Ararat sneakers, while a khaki green beanie hat rounded things off. 

In accordance with current safety guidelines he wore a safety mask while making his way across the sidewalk, but removed it before passing through the property's gates. 

Joining her husband, Hailey, 23, opted for a comparatively subdued black top with a single rose embellishment embroidered across its back.

The appearance comes after the couple celebrated their wedding anniversary with a picnic over the weekend. 

Speaking about their marriage shortly after exchanging vows, Hailey discussed the trials and tribulations of their union.

She told Vogue: 'I'm not going to sit here and lie and say it's all a magical fantasy. It's always going to be hard. It's a choice. You don't feel it every single day. You don't wake up every day saying, "I'm absolutely so in love and you are perfect." 

That's not what being married is. But there's something beautiful about it anyway.'

Devoutly Christian Justin recently reflected on how fame changed him in a recent Instagram caption, telling fans how his journey from small town boy to superstar affected him.

'I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada,' he explained. 'I didn’t have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music. 

'But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in.'

'My values slowly started to change. Ego and power started to takeover and my relationships suffered because of it. I truly desire healthy relationships. 

'I want to be motivated by truth and love. I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them!'

'I want to walk in the plans God has for me and not try and do it on my own! I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad! I’m grateful that I can walk with Jesus as he leads the way.'
