 She spent six-months presenting Channel 4’s legendary live morning show back in 1999.

And Kelly Brook looked delighted  as she reunited with her former The Big Breakfast co-host Johnny Vaughan at the Global Radio Studios in London on Monday.

The beauty, 40, looked stylish in a pastel summer dress as she embraced Johnny, 54, in the street.

Featuring a ruched bust and milkmaid sleeves, the colourful midi clung to her ample chest and skimmed out to a calf length hem. 

Kelly teamed the garment with a pair of fresh white trainers, and added more colour with a stack of vibrant bangles. 

She completed the look with small gold hooped earrings and wearing her glossy brunette tresses loose and tousled. 

Radio DJ Johnny looked casually cool in a navy shirt and jeans as he hugged Kelly.

Kelly was a 19-year old unknown when she was recruited to fill Denise Van Outen's shoes on The Big Breakfast,. 

But six-months after being unveiled as Van Outen's replacement in January 1999 she left the show, having failed to replicate her predecessor's chemistry with the lively, opinionated Vaughan. 

The abrupt departure led to a host of stand-in presenters taking her place, with Liza Tarbuck, Lisa Rogers, Amanda Byram and the returning Van Outen all filling in alongside Vaughan before the show went off-air in 2002.

Speaking in February 2019, Kelly admitted that her media career has been given a second chance by Capital Radio following various forays into acting, modelling and presenting. 

'It's been really lovely because I feel like I have been given another lifeline,' she told Hello! 

'You think: "Oh, that's it, maybe I had my go and it's someone else's turn." When an opportunity like this comes along, all of a sudden you've got another shot.'

Kelly's outing comes after she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up'. 

She also declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March.

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The brunette has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
