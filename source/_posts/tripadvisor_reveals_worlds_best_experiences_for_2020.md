A Dubai desert barbecue and camel ride trip has been named by Tripadvisor as its No1 experience, with a pizza and gelato cooking class in a Tuscan farmhouse in second place.

They have both been honoured in the 2020 Travellers' Choice Experiences awards, with the Harry Potter Walking Tour for Muggles in London claiming the top spot in the UK ranking and the Chicago Architecture River Cruise snaring the same accolade in the U.S.

The top-ranked Dubai experience, which costs from £46 ($59), is a half-day tour where guests can take part in sandboarding and dune bashing. The day is rounded off with dinner and a live performance, with previous guests describing the experience as a 'fab day out' and 'the best tour ever'.
