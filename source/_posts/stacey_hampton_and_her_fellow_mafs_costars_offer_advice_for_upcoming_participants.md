Filming for the 2021 season of Married At First Sight has officially commenced.

And as next year's offerings of brides and grooms prepare to walk down the aisle, some of the show's past participants have offered words of advice. 

'Don't let them get into your head,' urged Stacey Hampton, who failed to find love with businessman Michael Goonan on the show this year.

'Brides and grooms will need to be able to think for themselves and need to have strong will power,' the 27-year-old told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.

The mother of two, who has since found love outside of the reality show also encouraged newcomers to watch Stan's UnReal for a taste of what's to come.

Meanwhile, Amanda Micallef, who failed to find love with lesbian bride Tash Herz, advised hopefuls 'to go in with an open heart and not hold back.'

'Remember why you are there. Enjoy the ride as it'll be crazy, exciting, and perhaps the most disappointing and deflating thing you've ever done,' she continued.

Hayley Vernon, 32, who also split with her partner before the final commitment ceremony said that she hopes experts decide to take the matchmaking process serious this year.

'This is someone's life they are toying with,' she added.

In a bid to shake things up this year, experts Mel Schilling and John Aitken will be joined by Alessandra Rampolla, a certified clinical sexologist with more than 20 years' experience.

The reality star's words of advice come just days after Daily Mail Australia exclusively revealed Bryce Ruthven is one of the grooms set to appear on the show in 2021.

The Hit 104.7 radio presenter has taken three months of unpaid leave from his radio gig and temporarily relocated to Sydney.
