Kim Kardashian had a lot going through her head early Monday, telling fans she unable to sleep since long before sunrise. 

Sharing a black and white text post to her Instagram Story, the 39-year-old star said: 'Been up since 4:45am. Can't sleep. Do I get a head start on my workout or try and go back to sleep?'

Kim's restless night came as it's said that the mother-of-four is 'deeply disappointed and sad' about husband Kanye West's ongoing mental health struggles, according to Us Weekly.

Lots on her mind: Kim Kardashian woke up and couldn't go back to sleep early Monday. Her bout of insomnia comes amid reports the social media star is 'deeply disappointed and sad' about husband Kanye West's ongoing mental health struggles

Restless: Sharing a black and white text post to her Instagram Story, the 39-year-old star said: 'Been up since 4:45am. Can't sleep. Do I get a head start on my workout or try and go back to sleep?'

Instead of trying to go back to sleep or workout, the aspiring lawyer found an even better option, sharing photos of herself pouring over notes, flashcards and books from her legal studies.

'Gonna study,' she shared around 5:30am. 

It didn't seem too different from the star's usual routine. 

Last year she told sister Kourtney's lifestyle sit Poosh she likes to get up around '5:45am for my workout at 6 am.'

It seemed like early morning study time was the start of a busy day for Kim, whose next stop was the gym.

She had a few workout buddies this morning, sharing a photo of three pairs of sneaker-clad feet that belonged to sister Khloe Kardashian, her on-again beau Tristan Thompson, and the diva herself.

'Early bird special,' the Skims founder wrote on top.

Kimberly's baby bout of insomnia comes after reports she's been feeling down over husband Kanye's ongoing struggle with his mental health.  

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is reportedly worried about the 'vicious cycle' her husband is experiencing, after a series of bizarre Twitter rants and posting a video of him appearing to urinate on one of his Grammys statue.

A source told Us Weekly: 'She is deeply disappointed and sad because Kanye is struggling. It's a vicious cycle that Kim has had success at interrupting successfully for months at a time.'

They went on to say how Kim knows it is difficult for Kanye 'being isolated and alone'. 

'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn't healthy for Kanye ... She doesn't care about the tweets, that is Kanye being Kanye. The mood swings and the manic episodes that are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'

Meanwhile, Kim wants to 'be there' for Kanye.

The insider said: 'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he is bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help. She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.'

Kim is still 'focused on healing her relationship' despite the difficulties.

One insider said: 'Kim is focused on healing her relationship with Kanye and has been busy taking care of their kids and him. She has been helping and supporting him a ton while he's been struggling with his mental health and wants him to know and feel that she is there for him through thick and thin ... 

'The quarantine has been hard on Kanye and, in turn, has been difficult for her too. Their marriage definitely faced some hardships and was just hanging on with Kanye not being able to fully be present for their family, but ultimately Kim wants to keep everyone together and work things out for their kids.'
