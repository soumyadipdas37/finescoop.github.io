She always looks glamorous on a night out. 

And Jess Wright put on a leggy display as she stepped out in a black ensemble with statement Gucci tights in London on Saturday. 

The TOWIE star, 35, showcased her enviable curves as she joined Duncan James, 42, for Denise Van Outen's Cabaret All Stars show at Proud Embankment Theatre.

Jess wore her signature raven locks in loose waves over her shoulders and turned up the glam with full fluttery eyelashes and a dash of bronzer over her cheekbones.  

Finishing her look, Jess carried her evening essentials in a leather chain shoulder bag and added a pop of colour with a red manicure. 

Jess put on a very loved-up display as she arrived at the venue with her fiancé William Lee-Kemp who proposed during a trip to Courchevel in February.

'I've been dreaming of a fairytale wedding since I was little, when I used to dress up in my mum's net curtains,' she said. 

'At breakfast one morning he told me he was feeling unwell and returned to our room. When I went to find him, the door was ajar and there was music playing.

'There were candles lining the hallway, red rose petals scattered across the floor, flowers, red heart-shaped balloons and two glasses of champagne waiting. I was stunned.

'Then Will called me out on to the balcony. With the snowy mountains behind him, he went down on one knee and asked me to marry him.' 

Jess has already delivered socially distanced formal invites to her 15 bridesmaids for their upcoming wedding. 

The TV star wrote on Instagram: '2020 has been a strange year for us all.

'I got engaged just before this pandemic, & when rules were eased, told my (many) nearest & dearest that I wanted them to be my bridesmaids, from a distance.

'I hope everyone is keeping safe & we get through this soon & a big thank you to all our NHS & key workers for supporting us.'

Will you marry me? William proposed to Jess in ski resort Courchevel, France, in February
