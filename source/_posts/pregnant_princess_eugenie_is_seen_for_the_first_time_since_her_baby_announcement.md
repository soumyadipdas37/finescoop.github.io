Princess Eugenie wore a black dress that skimmed over her baby bump for her first public outing since her pregnancy announcement. 

Eugenie, 30, was joined by brother-in-law Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and a female friend for lunch at upmarket Italian restaurant Harry's Bar, in London's Mayfair, yesterday. 

The princess was radiant in a  pleated black dress with a belt tied under the bust, allowing for the fabric to fall over her blooming baby bump.

The trio were seen leaving the restaurant before strolling past designer stores on nearby streets. 

Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank, who married in October 2018, revealed last Friday they are expecting their first child together in 'early 2021'. A statement from Buckingham Palace said her grandmother the Queen was 'delighted'.

Family affair: The princess was joined by brother-in-law Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and an elegant female friend for lunch at upmarket Italian restaurant Harry's Bar, in London's Mayfair.



Pitter patter of tiny feet! Eugenie, 30, shared the news on Instagram last Friday with a sweet photo of baby slippers and the caption: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021'

Eugenie appeared in good spirits as she left Harry's Bar behind Edoard, who stayed close to his sister-in-law.  

Wrapping up against the cold, the princess added a felt coat in a autumnal deep teal shade which she wore unfastened over her dress. 

She accessorised with black leather boots, tights and a black leather bucket bag that she wore slung over one shoulder. 

Eugenie also wore a printed face mask as she walked down the street away from the restaurant, being more cautious than government guidelines require. 

Meanwhile Edo, who married Eugenie's older sister Beatrice in a private service in July, looked typically smart in a navy suit and white shirt.

Eugenie and Jack announced their pregnancy with a sweet Instagram post that came minutes after an official statement released by Buckingham Palace. 

Sharing the news on Instagram, Eugenie wrote: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021....,' alongside photos of baby slippers and her and Jack smiling. 

Sarah Ferguson shared her own excitement in a separate Instagram post, writing: 'I am so excited by the news that Eugenie and Jack are expecting their first child. Thrilled for them both and in my 60th year cannot wait to be a grandmother. Welcoming a new baby into the York family is going to be a moment of profound joy.'

The baby will be the first grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, and will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's ninth great-grandchild.

A spokesman for the duchess told the Mail that while she was clearly overjoyed at Eugenie's news, she also wanted to stress that she and Andrew very much saw Beatrice's stepson, Wolfie, as a grandchild too.

'Wolfie is already a very much-loved member of their family and the duchess is very keen to stress that she sees Wolfie as their grandchild too,' they said. The three-year-old is Mr Mapelli Mozzi's son by a previous relationship.

Eugenie and Jack's child will be 11th in the order of succession, which means the Queen's youngest son Prince Edward will slip down a place into 12th place.
