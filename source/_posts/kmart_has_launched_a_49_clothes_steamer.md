Kmart Australia has unveiled a $49 garment steamer on its website, and there are already hundreds of positive reviews.

The product, which provides customers with 50 minutes of continuous steam, claims to smooth out any item of clothing in seconds.

It comes complete with a removable 1.65 litre water tank with water level indicator, steaming board, glove, fabric brush, press for pants, rack and a telescopic pole.

'I've had mine for a little while now and have basically not used the ironing board since,' one woman said.

'It is really good. It was actually recommended to me by my favourite boutique who use the same model but more frequently due to the sheer number of clothes they have in store.'

'This is easily the best item I've ever bought from Kmart,' said another person.

A third added: 'I love mine! It's so quick to steam an item and it does all material (that I've noticed so far)'.

Some avid converts have even 'thrown away their regular iron' in favour of the steamer, which has a 12-month warranty

Kmart sells a hand held version for $35 which is 'easier to store' some customers said, but it has a smaller water tank. 

'My smaller hand held device is so good it will even clean suede boots,' one person said.

According to consumer advocacy group CHOICE, garment steamers are a better option than irons if you own a lot of vintage or delicate items.

'Because there's no pressure applied to the fabric fibres, as there is with irons and steam stations, garment steamers are much gentler on fragile fabrics,' a spokesperson said.  

You can use garment steamers on upholstery and soft furnishings, rugs and even curtains without the hassle of taking them down.

The steam can also reduce odours lingering on these everyday items.
