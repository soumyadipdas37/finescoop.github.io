The Big Bang Theory alum Jim Parsons revealed on Monday night that both he and his husband of three years, Todd Spiewak, contracted the coronavirus 'in the middle of March.'

'We didn't know what it was, we thought we had colds. And then it seemed less likely and then finally we lost our sense of smell and taste, utterly,' the 47-year-old Texan said on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.

'It defied the descriptions for me. I didn't realize how completely taste and smell could be gone. And when you're in quarantine and there's really nothing to do but eat - oh my god, that was brutal. I ate everything, but I just didn't taste it! The definition of wasted calories.'

Jim - who came out in a 2012 New York Times article - began dating the 43-year-old Young Sheldon executive producer in 2002 before eventually walking down the aisle in 2017.

As of Tuesday, there have reportedly been 7.18M confirmed COVID cases in the United States of America leading to 205K deaths. 

After their bout with COVID-19, Spiewak bleached Parsons' hair blond for fun since he wasn't working on any acting roles during quarantine.

'I had bleached my hair off and on in my 20s. It had been so long since I'd done it,' the Hollywood actor noted. 

Jim continued: 'Like, utterly, it defied the descriptions for me. I didn't realize how completely taste and smell could be gone'

Parsons added: 'And when you're in quarantine and there's really nothing to do but eat - oh my god, that was brutal. I ate everything, but I just didn't taste it! The definition of wasted calories'

During lockdown, Jim took painting classes and creative writing classes in an attempt to find other creative outlets.

'Everything petered out,' the four-time Emmy winner laughed.

'I don't know if the truth is, "Well you're just an actor and that’s what you do, and that's what you should do." Or if it's just that I don't really have the see through, stick to it [attitude] for anything. It's sort of embarrassing but you know, here I am.'

Parsons reprised his Tony-winning role as Michael in Joe Mantello's critically-acclaimed, big-screen version of 1968 play The Boys in the Band, which starts streaming this Wednesday on Netflix.
