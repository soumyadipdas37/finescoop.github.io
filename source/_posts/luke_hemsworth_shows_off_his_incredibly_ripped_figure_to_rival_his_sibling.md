Chris Hemsworth's buff body has women around the world swooning. 

But his older brother Luke is giving his Thor star sibling a run for his money, flaunting his ripped physique on social media on Thursday.  

The 39-year-old Westworld star revealed his muscular torso in an eye-popping topless photograph.

Posing in his backyard, the Australian actor looked hunky in nothing but a pair of black trousers. 

He also wore his blonde hair slicked back and appears to have recently grown a mustache.  

Luke cryptically captioned the photo with the lyrics to the first verse of Paul Simon's 'You Can Call Me Al'.

Luke is currently filming his new road movie Bosch and Rockit in Byron Bay. 

In the movie, which is inspired by real events, Luke is playing Bosch while rising actor Rasmus King, 15, is taking on the role of his son, Rockit.

Luke relocated from Los Angeles to the NSW coastal town late last year, along with wife Samantha and their four children.

His brothers Chris and Liam Hemsworth also reside in the laid back beach suburb.
