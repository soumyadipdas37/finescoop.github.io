Everton have submitted an amendment to the planning application for their stunning new 52,888-capacity stadium after releasing new designs for the venue at Bramley-Moore Dock.

The Merseyside club announced new images for their planned new home last month including a new stepped plaza facing the river for supporters to enjoy as well as removing a multi-storey carpark and lowering the overall height of the ground.

The new stadium is set to be completed in between 2023 and 2024, with its construction planned to begin in early next year. It will take Everton from their home near Stanley Park to the heart of the Port of Liverpool.

The club released new designs for the new 52,888-capacity stadium at Bramley-Moore dock revealing plans to build a riverside plaza (above) for fans to have riverside views

The club say the 'world-class' development aims to regenerate the semi-derelict area of the the city's northern docklands, contributing a £1bn boost to the regions economy, creating up to 15,000 jobs and attracting 1.5m visitors to the city each year. 

In a statement on the club's official website, Stadium Development Director Colin Chong said: 'We have further enhanced one of the most exciting development projects in the country. 

'By working closely with Liverpool City Council and all our key stakeholders we have refined our plans to ensure a better connection between the stadium and the River. The public stepped plaza will become a high-quality start and end to the planned river walk and a destination benefitting the local community as well as visitors to the city on non-matchdays.

The club say the new site will help regenerate the semi-derelict area of the city's docks 

'This will be a transformational development for not just North Liverpool but for the Northern Powerhouse.

'If we are granted planning approval, this will be a world class football stadium in an iconic location and a key part of the city, city region, and the UK's post-covid-19 recovery plan.

'We have invested an enormous amount of resource and effort in creating a design that not only respects and looks at home in a dockland setting but will also restore and preserve the historic features of Bramley-Moore Dock and, importantly, open a currently inaccessible site to the public.'

Planning for the new stadium is set to begin in early 2021 despite delays due to coronavirus 

The plaza replaces the idea of a multi-storey car park, with Everton looking to free up more space for supporters on a matchday. 

Meanwhile, solar panels will now be moved onto the stadium roof, rather than outside the West Stand to create more space for fans. 

The Club hopes that work could commence on-site early in 2021, subject to approval to the plans by Liverpool City council.

They have been at their current home Goodison Park since 1892 making the venue at Stanley Park is one of the oldest in English football, hosting more top flight games than any other ground.
