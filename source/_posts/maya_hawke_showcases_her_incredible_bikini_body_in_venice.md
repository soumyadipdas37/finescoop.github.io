The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on Wednesday and ends on the 12 September. 

Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis, with temperature checks and mask wearing becoming mandatory. 

Maya's appearance comes after she appeared to confirm her budding romance with Sienna Miller's ex Tom Sturridge, 34, in New York City in August.

The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star and The Boat That Rocked actor looked very cosy as they walked arm-in-arm and kissed.

Tom has a daughter, Marlowe, eight, whom he shares with ex-fiancée Sienna Miller, who recently split from her third fiancé Lucas Zwirner, 29.

Since Stranger Things season four suspended filming in Atlanta back in mid-March, Maya has been quarantining in upstate New York at the homes of her famous parents Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Delighted to be spending some quality time with her daughter, Uma, 49, posted a picture of herself giving Maya a haircut in April, she wrote on Instagram: 'Home hair cuts bring us back home. We are all finding ourselves again.'  

Maya discussed her living situation in an interview with Nylon, and lamented losing her independence in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

Lookalike: Maya bore a striking resemblance to her mother, Hollywood starlet, Uma

'I feel like the last three years of my life have been a dream and I'm just a kid again with my family,' she explained.

Maya added: 'I moved out and got my whole life together and became a person. And this disease is like, "Ha ha ha, just kidding! You're a kid, and you live with your parents."'

In addition to Maya, Ethan Hawke and ex-wife Uma also share an 18-year-old son named Levon.  

Ethan and second wife Ryan, whom he married in 2009, have children Clementine, 12, and Indiana, nine, together. While Uma also has daughter Luna, eight.
