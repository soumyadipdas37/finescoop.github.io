Lucy Spraggan detailed her struggle with binge eating in a candid Instagram post shared on Saturday.

The singer, 28, shared a snap from a night out which saw her show off her abs in a crop top beside a throwback snap before her recent weight loss as she expressed her desire to maintain a balanced lifestyle

In the caption, she wrote: 'I tend to relax a lot more on the weekends which can sometimes enable my laziness and unlock my passion for large bars of chocolate, so I remind myself, life is about balance and enjoyment.

'What I eat doesn’t define who I am': Lucy Spraggan detailed her struggle with binge eating as she shared a candid post via Instagram on Saturday following her recent weight loss

'I’m gonna get my lifters on, get my a** down to the gym and throw around some weights, then I’m going to have an afternoon of lounging and hitting the cake.'

Lucy added that she had plans to see friends on Sunday so that they could embark on a long walk with their dogs before enjoying a roast dinner.

Speaking candidly about her relationship with food, Lucy went on: 'Quite honestly I can (still) be prone to binge eating if I forget to include balance in my lifestyle. 

'I used to think "I’ll have this as a treat" and then I’d be really full of guilt and shame about what I’d eaten and I’d eat more to feel better. Then it’d go round in circles.

Candid: Speaking about her relationship with food, Lucy went on: 'I am definitely worthy of cake and ice cream, fruit and sweets, salad and steak and what I eat doesn’t define who I am'

'I learnt that I am definitely worthy of cake and ice cream, fruit and sweets, salad and steak and what I eat doesn’t define who I am.

'I’ll be eating what is tasty this weekend whilst being conscious about how much energy my body needs and not over-fuelling it. Learning about that really changed everything for me.'

Lucy marked 11 months of sobriety in June by sharing a candid post revealing how she's never 'felt as alive and awake' as she does now.

The singer-songwriter overhauled her lifestyle following the breakdown of her marriage.

Writing on social media earlier this year, Lucy explained how she previously spent 'so much of her life just incredibly sad' and 'hiding behind the false confidence that drinking gave'.

The former X Factor contestant, who is releasing a new album soon, also added that giving up alcohol for almost a year is her 'biggest achievement to date'.

She wrote: 'Today I am 11 months sober. 11 months ago I had no idea what kind of an impact giving up alcohol would have on my life but I knew that I’d had enough of burying my problems, hiding behind the false confidence that drinking gave me and spending so much of my life just incredibly sad.

'I didn’t drink every day, I didn’t physically depend on alcohol, I couldn’t think of anything worse than drinking in the morning and I used to think that meant I didn’t have a problem. I didn’t fit the mould of what a person with an alcohol problem looked like.

'I was a self-described ‘life of the party’ which meant I needed everyone to be having MY kind of fun, everything had to be 100mph, I’d be pushy if you weren’t keeping up with me and I was always the last one to bed. Or not sometimes. But I always ended up in this miserable trance, either at the end of the night or for the days after.'

Lucy then reflected on what she has learned over the past months while she has turned her lifestyle completely upside down.

She wrote: 'What I know about myself now after 11 months? I have issues with moderation. I either have the whole cake or no cake at all. 

'I either work out so hard I fracture my own rib or I don’t work out. I know now that it wouldn’t just be one cheeky Guinness, so for me, it’s none at all. 

'I have learnt what discipline means. With stopping an entire lifetime of habit I have learnt what it means to say no to myself, and in turn what it feels like to say ‘yes’ to myself. 

Wow! Lucy overhauled her lifestyle to achieve her new ripped physique and healthy mindset following the breakdown of her marriage to Georgina Gordon

'To push my body to do incredible things, learn new skills, let actual authentic happiness into my brain. 11 months of sobriety, amongst a lot of other achievements I hold highly, is my biggest to date. Next month I turn 29 years old and 12 months sober. I have never felt as alive and awake as I do right now.

'My song ‘Sober’ on my new album ‘Choices’ is one of my favourite I’ve ever written and I can’t wait for you to hear it. You can pre-order it in my bio. Have the best day.'

Lucy has been showcasing her incredible fitness journey on her Instagram page, often posting jaw-dropping snaps of her abs.

The X Factor's new lifestyle includes four long-distance runs a week totalling 45km as well as three 90 minute weight lifting sessions.

Her everyday diet typically consists of cereal followed by vegetarian sausages and toast, salad and protein for lunch and fish, rice and salad for dinner.

Lucy's decision to change the way she was living was sparked following her split from wife Georgina Gordon, 31, who she married in 2016 after two years of dating.

The former couple endured several failed fertility attempts and announced their decision to separate last November.

Explaining how fitness has also helped her mentally to Closer magazine, Lucy explained: 'I needed mental clarity to deal with the preparation of divorce and fitness and feeling good has definitely helped my state of mind.'
