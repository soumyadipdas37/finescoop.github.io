Up to 300 Black Lives Matter protesters have gathered outside Notting Hill tube station in west London for a demonstration.
The Million People March is protesting against systemic racism and is taking place in lieu of this year's Notting Hill carnival. Demonstrators lay down in the road outside Notting Hill tube station, blocking oncoming traffic. 
Protesters chanted 'whose streets, our streets' and 'this is what democracy looks like' and held placards as they began moving down to Hyde Park. 
Despite organisers urging social distancing and mask wearing for the march today, a number of demonstrators have been pictured close together or not wearing a face covering.

Numbers on the Million People march started at just a few dozen but swelled to around 300 as demonstrators made their way down Bayswater Road.
The march stopped outside Hyde Park and broke into a rendition of Redemption Song by Bob Marley as demonstrators raised their fists.
Organisers say the movement plans to push a Race Offenders Register, to prosecute those committing race offences. 
Prior to the bank holiday weekend police said a pan-London operation was in place to keep people safe.  
The force said they were aware of a number of planned demonstrations and events taking place across London, and have been liaising with the organisers, advising them to carefully consider the Health Protection Regulations regarding gatherings. 
Contravening this legislation could result in anyone involved in the holding of a large gathering (over 30 people) being subjected to a fine up to £10,000. 
Commander Bas Javid, said: 'Our approach to policing London during this time has been to engage, explain, encourage and only then enforce, and this will continue across what we believe will be a busy long weekend.

'We know people will want to be out celebrating the holiday, and we want them to do so safely reminding people of the restrictions which are in place to keep them safe.
'Throughout this week, officers have been travelling in a Met engagement bus across London, working in conjunction with local authorities and other blue light services to meet with communities, reminding them of the Government health restrictions, and explaining our policing style and operation.
'Watch the celebration of Carnival from the comfort of your own home, online. We urge people to not come into the traditional area to celebrate; there are no events. Where there are large gatherings of people, officers will be deployed to interact with those gathered.
'Unlicensed Music Events (UMEs) are a blight on our communities and cause untold distress and fear, often attracting criminal behaviour and violence. If you have information about a UME contact us so we can respond quickly to close them down.'
