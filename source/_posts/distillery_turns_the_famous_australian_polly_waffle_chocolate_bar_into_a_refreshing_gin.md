While many remember the iconic Polly Waffle chocolate bar from the 80s, a distillery has deconstructed the flavours and turned it into a refreshing gin.

Australian brand The Gin Birds created Polly's Gin to bring back childhood memories through a different form.

The new product is available to pre-order via the Gindex website for $38 per 200mL bottle.  

The Polly Waffle chocolate bar has a waffle tube filled with marshmallow and is coated in delicious chocolate.

The distillery partnered with Victorian company That Spirited Lot to recreate the flavours.

To imitate the sweetness from the chocolate, dried orchard fruits, coconut, allspice and cacao was used, while marshmallow root, ruby grapefruit peel, lemon peel, almond, pistachio and Ceylon vanilla helped mimic the marshmallow flavour.

The gin itself is also made using notes of organic juniper and coriander, and the label on the bottle replicates the colour and text of a Polly Waffle wrapper.

Chamaine Lovett co-founder of The Gin Birds told delicious.com: 'We grew up in the 80s so we know just how deliriously popular this bar is.

'We set a challenge to our partner distiller to create something reminiscent of this childhood icon yet grown up, and the result is a spectacular gin.'

Eager customers swiftly shared words of praise on social media after the distillery shared the product news online.

'Looks and sounds incredible!! Can't wait to try it,' one person said on Instagram.

'Wow well done! My hubby loved polly waffles,' another said.

The Polly Waffle chocolate bar itself will be rising from the dead and making a return to store shelves in early 2021 after more than a decade.  

The federal government is pumping almost $50 million into manufacturing projects to create new jobs during the coronavirus pandemic.

One of the beneficiaries is sweet-maker Robern Menz in South Australia, which will receive $1million to establish a Polly Waffle production line.

The project is expected to create 38 jobs. About 200 projects overall will be supported through the manufacturing cash splash.

Polly Waffles were originally made in 1947 by Hoadley's Chocolates in Melbourne, and were later bought by Rowntree and Nestle.
