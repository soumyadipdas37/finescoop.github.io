Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius has finalised his loan move to Union Berlin.

The 27-year-old, who has not featured competitively for Liverpool since the 2018 Champions League final, arrived in Berlin on Sunday evening and completed a medical on Monday ahead of agreeing a season loan.

Liverpool wanted £6million for Karius who has spent the last two seasons with Besiktas and had enquiries from Montpellier and Hertha Berlin. He is surplus to requirements with Alisson Becker, who is an injury doubt for tonight's clash with Arsenal, and Adrian well established at Anfield.

However, with nobody willing to meet the asking price, Liverpool have loaned Karius out for a year in the hope he can improve his market value. Liverpool's Nigerian striker Taiwo Awoniyi is also at Union.

Liverpool expect to offload more players before the end of the window. Burnley remain in talks over a prospective £15m deal for Harry Wilson while £25m-rated Rhian Brewster is waiting for Crystal Palace and Sheffield United to meet Liverpool's demands.

Marko Grujic has interest from Borussia Monchengladbach and Liverpool would consider offers for Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri. Hull City are interested in Ben Woodburn and Poland U21 goalkeeper Kamil Grabara is talking to Greek club PAOK.

Liverpool are also adding Brazilian goalkeeper Marcelo Pitaluga from Fluminense this week for around £1.9m.
