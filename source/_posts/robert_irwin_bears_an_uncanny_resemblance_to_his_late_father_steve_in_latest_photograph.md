'This research was all started by Dad and to this day we still use the same methods of capture that he created,' he captioned the post. 

'Today we get to keep this vital work going, using state of the art solar tracking technology to learn even more about these amazing animals make sure Dad’s mission and passion for croc conservation continues!' 

In the photograph Robert was clutching a small crocodile and his Australia Zoo uniform was covered in mud.
