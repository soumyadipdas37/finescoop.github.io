Amid a year filled with national crises including the coronavirus pandemic, heightened racial tensions and now wildfires raging across the US, several stars took a moment to remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11 2001. 

Actor Chris Pratt took to social media to mark the day, writing, 'May we honor the fallen with our continued defense of liberty, one nation, under God, indivisible. May we continually pursue a more perfect union.

'And may we never forget, not only the fallen, but the values for which we stand, lest their death be in vain. #911 #september11 #unitedwestand' the Guardians of the Galaxy star added.

Chris' tribute came alongside an image of the Manhattan skyline at night with two beams of light (Tribute in Light) shining up into the sky in the place where the two World Trade Center towers once stood. 

Over the image are the words 'We will never forget'.

Around the country, some communities have canceled 9/11 commemorations because of the pandemic, while others are going ahead, sometimes with modifications.

In New York, victims' relatives gathered Friday morning for split-screen remembrances, one at the September 11 memorial plaza at the World Trade Center and another on a nearby corner, set up by a separate 9/11-related organization. 

Memorial leaders said the change for the 19th anniversary of the attacks was a coronavirus-safety precaution.
