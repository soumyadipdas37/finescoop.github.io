Michelle Bridges has been running her business empire from Bowral, after moving out of her marital home in Sydney earlier this year following her split from ex-partner Steve 'Commando' Willis.

And on Tuesday, the 49-year-old former Biggest Loser trainer enjoyed some bonding time with her four-year-old son, Axel.

Posting to Instagram, the fitness guru shared two sweet photos of her child playing in the garden of her Southern Highlands home.

In one photo, Axel is seen running towards the camera with an excited look on his face. Michelle captioned the family snap: 'My boy.' 

The second photo, which she cryptically captioned 'life choices', features Axel in the distance with a stunning sunset in the background.

Axel was sporting navy pants and a blue-and-grey striped jumper, which he paired with white sneakers.

Her post follows what has been a tumultuous year for Michelle, who broke up with Commando in January.

The couple began dating in 2015, after splitting from their respective partners, and welcomed their son, Axel, in December that year.

They announced their split in January this year. After their break-up, Michelle was arrested for drink driving on Australia Day, and was later convicted.

She was fined $750 and had her licence disqualified for three months, after pleading guilty to mid-range drink driving.

A tearful Michelle said outside court: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep remorse, shame and humiliation [over] this incident and extreme lack of judgment.

'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment and the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'
