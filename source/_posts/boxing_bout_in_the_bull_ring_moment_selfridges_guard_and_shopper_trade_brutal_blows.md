This is the shocking moment a security guard and a shopper brawled outside a Selfridges following a row about entering the store with rollerblades.

Violence was sparked between the security worker and irate customer at Birmingham's Bull Ring shopping centre on Saturday, as the pair traded blows in front of stunned onlookers by the entrance of the upmarket department store.

In the footage, obtained by website Birmz Is Grime, one man can be heard saying 'chill man' during the confrontation, which sees two men continue to throw punches.

Selfridges said police were called to the scene after trouble flared when the member of the public tried to enter the shop with rollerblades.

A Selfridges spokesperson said: 'An altercation took place on the evening of Saturday 26th September at the front of our Birmingham store, between a man carrying rollerblades attempting to enter the store and a security guard.

'The latter half of the incident was captured on a smart phone.

'We take the safety and security of our staff and colleagues very seriously and we are fully investigating the situation.'

The clip, which was posted with the caption 'security guard vs shopper at Selfridges, Welcome to brum' has since gone viral after being uploaded to social media.

The security guard throws the first punch after being shoved by the bearded customer against the glass-fronted entrance of the store.

The shopper can be seen wearing no shoes with a pair of rollerblades discarded nearby as he scraps with the bouncer.

One web user wrote 'toughest security guard I've seen in decades'.

Another added: 'I hope he doesn't lose his job for this.'

One person put: 'At least there's no weapons involved like we usually see these days. Old fashioned straightener.'

A third said: 'Worst boxing match I've seen in ages but the security guard takes it on points for me. Still shocking scenes to see in a public place.'
