The Duke of Cambridge saluted the emergency services for their 'tireless work' and their incredible efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Prince William, 38, have a speech during a special online thanksgiving service to honour 999 heroes organised by the National Emergency Services Memorial charity. 

The event, which takes place yearly, celebrates the work of the NHS and emergency response staff and is attended by politicians and members of the royal family. 

It was meant to take place today at the Belfast Cathedral, but was moved online this year due.   

During his speech, Prince William stressed what a great source of pride the emergency services community was for the UK, and he thanked them repeatedly for the way in which they helped save others during the Covid-19 crisis.

Speaking in a video from Kensington Palace, he said: 'At one point or another, each and everyone of us will benefit from the care and protection provided by our emergency services.

'Their courage and self-dedication to their work is something this country is rightly proud of. 

'This year more than ever, we've been repeatedly reminded of the sacrifices made by all those in the emergency community as they worked tirelessly to protect us against covid-19 and keep the country going in the most challenging circumstances.

Prince William, who worked full-time as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance serice near Cambridhe airport in 2014 until 2017, drew from his personal experience in his speech.

'Having had the privilege of working alongside the emergency responders, I've always been struck by their remarkable can-do attitude in the face of even the greatest emergencies,' he said. 

'They showcase the very best that our country has to offer, and this is never more apparent than at times like these.

He moved on to honour the memories of responders who had died in the line of duty.  

'Tragically, some will pay the ultimate price as a result of their efforts in their line of duty,' he said, adding: 'While others will experience the lasting effects on their physical hea;th or mental well-being.'

Prince William then called for more support of the emergency services across the country.  

'We all have a responsibility to do what we can to support this community. And to remember their efforts to keep us safe,' he said. 

'As well as the many sacrifices made by both them and their families, which is why today's service is so important,' he added.  

'On behalf of my family I want to thank you all, your hard work, your determination and your courage are a tremendous source of pride for our country and we will be forever grateful for what all of you do,' he concluded.

The father-of-three was joined by the First Ministers of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.

Today's programme included singing from the Blue Light Choir. Videos from the Chairs of the Police, Fire and Ambulance Councils and Director of Her Majesty's Coastguard were also shared during the event.  

Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock MP, also voiced his appreciation for the emergency services, saying: 'Our emergency services and frontline NHS workers play a pivotal role in keeping us safe, and have worked tirelessly to protect us all throughout this pandemic.

'This has never been more true than during the unprecedented times we have been through over recent months in our fight against Coronavirus.

'We are all incredibly grateful for your continued hard work, and I am honoured to participate in this special online programme to express my thanks to everybody in our emergency services and NHS.'

 The mutli-faith event also included a wreath laying ceremony to remember to the more than 7,500 emergency services personnel who had lost their lives in the line of duty, 300 of which have died after contracting the coronavirus.
