Chaos erupted outside the White House on Saturday following another night of Black Lives Matter protests that saw police clash with demonstrators, striking them with rubber bullets and detonating stun grenades, as they moved to clear out crowds.&nbsp;
Hundreds of protesters had gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza to rally against police brutality and racial injustice, following another week of unrest triggered by the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake in Wisconsin last Sunday.&nbsp;
Members of the Metropolitan Police Department were out in force as demonstrators marched towards the White House chanting, &#039;No cops, no KKK, no fascists&#039;.
Shortly before midnight, tensions between protesters and law enforcement boiled over, as police officers in riot gear began charging at protesters to move them out of the area.&nbsp;

Officers were seen deploying tear gas grenades, pepper spray and using flash bang devices to disperse crowds.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Videos shared on social media showed protesters retaliating, with some throwing projectiles at cops and playing loud music.&nbsp;
In&nbsp;one clip, one man was seen picking up a tear gas canister from the ground and hurling it back at police.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The confrontation then took a violent turn as cops began firing rubber bullets into the crowd, injuring protesters as well as members of the press, according to one reporter.&nbsp;
At one point, cops targeted a white BLM van on the street, smashing its windows and arresting the passengers inside. It is unclear why they were detained.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The protest in Washington was just one of several across the country on Saturday as demonstrations against police brutality and racism continue three months after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.&nbsp;
In Portland, Oregon, where violent protests have broken out every night since May 25, one man was shot dead after a large caravan of Trump supporters and BLM protesters clashed in the streets.
The man was pictured wearing a Patriot Prayer baseball cap, appearing to show support for the far-right group which is frequently present during Portland protests.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile in&nbsp;Kenosha, Wisconsn, the latest flash point for unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake last Sunday, protests were relatively peaceful following a rally earlier in the day that saw thousands of people march to the county courthouse to demand change.&nbsp;

PORTLAND, OREGON A man was shot and killed in Portland on Saturday night amid deadly clashes between Trump fans and BLM activists
PORTLAND, OREGON Medics tried unsuccessfully to save the man, who was shot on the corner of Southwest 3rd Avenue and Alder Street. He was reported to be wearing&nbsp;a Patriot Prayer baseball cap, showing allegiance to the far-right group
PORTLAND, OREGON A Trump supporter caravan was organized on Facebook, with 2,500 people intending to attend. Around 1,000 showed up (pictured)&nbsp;
Crowds took to the streets chanting, &#039;seven bullets, seven days&#039; - a reference to the number of times Blake was shot - as they marched toward the court, where speakers encouraged protesters to vote for change in November, and to push for legislation in Wisconsin that would lead to police reform.
But unlike last week&#039;s demonstrations in the city, most&nbsp;people on Saturday dispersed from the protest before the 7pm curfew.&nbsp;
More than an hour later, law enforcement officers, including some wearing U.S. Marshals Service identification, surrounded about a dozen people who remained outside the courthouse and made several arrests.&nbsp;
As night fell, National Guard troops and police officers in riot gear remained outside the fenced area surrounding several government buildings that have been at the center of the unrest over the past week.&nbsp;
During the rally earlier, Blake&#039;s father, Jacob Blake Sr, called on protesters to refrain from looting and vandalism, which had overshadowed peaceful protests before a tense calm set in the past three nights.&nbsp;
&#039;Good people of this city understand. If we tear it up we have nothing, Blake Sr said. &#039;Stop it. Show &#039;em for one night we don&#039;t have to tear up nothing.&#039;&nbsp;
He gave an impassioned call for changing a system he described as fostering police brutality and racial inequities.
KENOSHA, WISCONSIN Police arrested several people outside the Kenosha County Courthouse on Saturday after following a day of largely peaceful protests

KENOSHA, WISCONSIN About 1,000 people joined a mile-long march in Kenosha on Saturday, chanting &#039;Black Lives Matter&#039; and &#039;No Justice, No Peace&#039;, a week after the police shooting of Jacob Blake&nbsp;
KENOSHA, WISCONSIN Protesters marched with Blake&#039;s family towards the courthouse where speakers&nbsp;encouraged the crowd to vote for change in November, and to push for legislation in Wisconsin that would lead to police reform
&#039;There were seven bullets put in my son&#039;s back... Hell yeah, I&#039;m mad,&#039; said Blake Sr.&nbsp;&#039;What gave [police] the right to attempted murder on my child? What gave them the right to think that my son was an animal?&nbsp;
&#039;What gave them the right to take something that was not theirs? I&#039;m tired of this,&#039; he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey and two other officers were responding to a domestic dispute call last Sunday when Sheskey shot 29-year-old Blake in the back.&nbsp;
Blake Sr told reporters on Saturday that his son is heavily sedated, but he has regained consciousness.
&#039;He&#039;s in a lot of pain,&#039; he said. &#039;I just wish I could pick my baby up and make it all right.&#039;&nbsp;
He called for Sheskey to be charged and for the other two officers at the scene to be fired.
Several of Saturday&#039;s speakers encouraged the crowd to vote for change in November, and to push for changing legislation.
&#039;Justice is a bare minimum,&#039; Lt Governor Mandela Barnes said. &#039;Justice should be guaranteed to everybody in this country.&#039;
Blake Sr asked those at the rally to raise their fists with him saying &#039;We are not going to stop going in the right direction. We&#039;re going to the top ... we&#039;re gonna make legislation happen because that&#039;s the only thing that they recognize,&#039; he said.&nbsp;
&#039;We all have a knee on the back of our necks, every day,&#039; he added, referring to the death of George Floyd, who died on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

KENOSHA, WISCONSIN&nbsp;Police officers in riot gear patrol the area following a rally in Kenosha. Earlier this week, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers approved a request for an additional 500 National Guard troops to be deployed&nbsp;
KENOSHA, WISCONSIN&nbsp;The commander of the National Guard said Friday that more than 1,000 Guard members had been deployed to help keep the peace, with more on the way
One of Blake&#039;s sisters, Letetra Widman, said she felt recharged &#039;to stand up not just for Jacob, but for all the people who have not gotten justice.&#039;
Captured on cellphone video, the shooting sparked new protests against racial injustice and police brutality months after Floyd&#039;s death touched off a wider reckoning on race.
Tensions escalated on Tuesday night after two&nbsp;protesters were killed by an armed civilian who claimed to have been defending the city.&nbsp;
The commander of the National Guard said Friday that more than 1,000 Guard members had been deployed to help keep the peace, with more on the way.&nbsp;
Following the rally, White House spokesman Judd Deere told reporters Saturday night President Trump will visit Kenosha on Tuesday to meet with law enforcement and survey damage from recent demonstrations that turned violent.
Trump, who toured hurricane-ravaged areas of Louisiana and Texas earlier Saturday, had told reporters that he &#039;probably&#039; would visit the city.
KENOSHA, WISCONSIN Protesters hold up placards at the Kenosha rally on Saturday. One protester had a sign reading &#039;Why did Jake [Blake] get shot in the back while Kyle [Rittenhouse] got a thank you?&#039;&nbsp;

Asked to weigh in on Tuesday&#039;s shootings in which 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was charged, Trump demurred and said &#039;it&#039;s under investigation&#039; and that &#039;we are looking at it very, very carefully.&#039;
Aniyah Ervin, a 16-year-old from Kenosha who is black, said Saturday that the week has been surreal.&nbsp;
Although she protested against racial injustice over the summer, she said there had been a feeling that police brutality was not a problem in Kenosha. But, she said, Blake&#039;s shooting &#039;shows it can happen anywhere.&#039;
Will Turner, who is black, said he brought his two children from Madison for the march to &#039;show them the power of peaceful protesting.&#039;
Investigators have said little about what led to Blake&#039;s shooting.&nbsp;
The Kenosha police union said Blake had a knife and fought with officers, putting one of them in a headlock as two efforts to stun him with a Taser were unsuccessful. State investigators have said only that officers found a knife on the floor of the car.
In the cellphone video recorded by a bystander, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of an SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns drawn and shout at him.&nbsp;
As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire. Three of Blake&#039;s children were in the vehicle.
The man who recorded the video, 22-year-old Raysean White, said he heard police yell at Blake, &#039;Drop the knife! Drop the knife!&#039; before gunfire erupted. White said he didn&#039;t see a knife in Blake&#039;s hands.
BY ANDREW COURT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM&nbsp;&nbsp;
People caught rioting during large protests could be stripped of their&nbsp;federal unemployment benefits and be forced to pay an order of restitution to police under a new bill proposed by a Republican Congressman.&nbsp;
Jim Banks, who represents Indiana&#039;s 3rd congressional district, introduced the &#039;Support Peaceful Protest Act&#039; on Friday, with the aim of stopping the riots, looting and vandalism that have occurred across the country in recent months.&nbsp;
The bill will have to pass the U.S. House and Senate before it becomes written into law, but Banks says he hopes it will protect peaceful protesters and police officers, as well as bystanders who inadvertently become caught up in a crowd.

Those convicted of a crime associated with a large protest - such as looting - would lose their federal unemployment benefit if the bill is passed. Pictured People inside a Dolce &amp; Gabbana store in New York on June 1&nbsp;
Jim Banks, who represents Indiana&#039;s 3rd congressional district, introduced the &#039;Support Peaceful Protest Act&#039; on Friday
The bill proposes that if an individual is convicted of a federal offense while at a protest in which police are present, they will have to &#039;pay an order of restitution...&nbsp; that is equal to the cost of such policing activity, as determined by the court.&#039;&nbsp;
Further, Banks proposes that those engaging in rioting, looting and arson should be stripped of federal benefits accessible during the COVID-19 crisis, such as the $600 per week unemployment assistance drawn from the CARES Act.&nbsp;
In an interview with WIBC, Banks says he believes a majority of rioters who intentionally disrupt protests are currently unemployed and receiving benefits.&nbsp;
&#039;Due to enhanced federal benefits, taxpayers are giving wages to jobless rioters that are destroying our communities. We need to cut them off from their funding and make them feel the full financial consequences of their actions,&#039; Banks stated.&nbsp;
He continued &#039;&#039;Many of these people are not working. They have the time to show up every day at some of these violent protests like in Washington, D.C. and they&#039;re getting $600 a week of unemployment to do it, and that&#039;s got to stop.&#039;
Banks was referring to chaotic scenes that unfolded in Washington, D.C. on Thursday night, following the conclusion of the Republican National Convention at the White House.&nbsp;
Photographers captured two of Banks&#039; constituents - an elderly couple from Indiana - being verbally abused and intimidated by a young protester as they left the event
Guests, including Senator Rand Paul, were heckled and abused as they made their way out of the event.&nbsp;
The Senator and his wife had to be protected by police officers, and he later claimed the &#039;crazed mob&#039; was &#039;shouting threats to kill us&#039;.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, photographers captured two of Banks&#039; constituents - an elderly couple from Indiana - being verbally abused and intimidated by a young protester as they left the event.&nbsp;
The photograph caused outrage, with Banks sharing the image and tweeting to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing her of not doing enough to stop bad behavior.&nbsp;
&#039;Hey @SpeakerPelosi, these are my constituent. They are good people. If you told these mobs to stop, I have a feeling they would... &#039;
Meanwhile, Banks theorized that Antifa was behind a lot of the rioting.&nbsp;
&#039;Antifa thugs are descending on suffering communities, disrupting peaceful protests and leaving violence, looting and vandalism in their wake,&#039; he stated.&nbsp;
&#039;They turned Milwaukee, Seattle and Portland into warzones, and now they&rsquo;re moving the chaos to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Who knows which community is next?&#039;
