She is pulling back the curtain on her infamous Hollywood socialite persona in the  upcoming documentary This Is Paris, which will premiere on September 14.

But Paris Hilton looked nothing but glamorous on Saturday as she enjoyed an afternoon shopping trip in Beverly Hills. 

The 39-year-old businesswoman was all smiles as she strutted down the sidewalk in a pair of lace-up heels while also opting to go without a face mask.

Hilton rocked a rainbow zip-up jacket that was completely covered in sequins and featured accents of black on the collar and wrists.

Slung over her shoulder was a silver backpack that was covered in a similar rainbow stripe pattern.

Paris paired her colorful jacket with a plain white tee and some dark denim skinny jeans. 

The Simple Life star flashed her killer smile at fellow shoppers, while donning a pair of stylish oversized sunglasses.

Her blonde hair was parted to one side and flowed down her back in loos waves.

Paris was accompanied by a female friend who had a large white shopping bag in her hand. 

Hilton is usually in the company of her entrepreneur beau Carter Reum, 39, who she began dating earlier this year. 

Paris and Carter celebrated their seven-month anniversary on August 29.

To commemorate the special date and their love, Hilton uploaded a touching tribute to her boyfriend on Instagram.

'When we first met, I had no idea of the amazing journey I was about to embark on. My life was always empty, like I was missing something. But when I met you, I knew you were the one,' she began.

Paris included a black-and-white snapshot of herself and Reum sharing a tender moment.

She continued: 'You’ve filled my heart with so much love. I believe that everything happens for a reason because everything in my life, all the good and the bad, has led me right to you.

'You are my reason for me being so happy and feeling like the luckiest girl in the world! I love making you happy and promise to make you smile forever

'Love so much handsome! Happy anniversary!' concluded Hilton, along with a lightening bolt emoji,' concluded Hilton in the post seen by her 12.5million followers.

Though things with Carter are going great, it was not always smoothing sailing for Paris when it came to relationships. 

In a clip from her impending documentary shared with People, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life.

'I was strangled, I was hit, I was grabbed aggressively. I put up with things no one should,' said the star, who believes she was set up for a future of abusive relationships while attending the Provo Canyon boarding school as a teenager.

Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.

'They all seemed like such nice guys and then the true colors would show,' Paris explained. 'They'd get jealous, or defensive or try to control me. And there there would come a point where they would become physically, verbally and emotionally abusive.'

Paris initially interpreted the 'crazy' behavior as an indicator of just how much they loved her.

'Looking back, I can't believe I let people treat me like that,' she said.
