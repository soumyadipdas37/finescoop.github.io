A glamorous PE teacher will spend at least two years behind bars after she was caught sending sexually explicit messages to a 14-year-old boy.

Katie Smith, 28, from NSW's Hunter Region befriended the student on Snapchat in Term 4 of 2018 and the pair continued to meet up into Term 1 of the following year.

Smith and the teenager kissed and fondled each other on two separate occasions in the school store room and another time in a carpark.

Upon appearing at the Newcastle District Court on Friday, the teacher broke down in tears as she was sentenced to three years and ten months jail.

Katie Smith, 28, from NSW's Hunter region has been jailed for at least two years after having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student

The PE teacher befriended the student on Snapchat and had sent him explicit messages during 2018 and 2019

She was given a non-parole period of two years and three months, The Daily Telegraph reported.

The court heard Smith had not wanted to have sex with the student but craved attention due to issues she was facing with her husband.

She claimed she just 'wanted to be told I was pretty' and would always 'do anything and everything to get attention'.

Smith was found to have sent the teenager pictures of her breasts as well as a video of her rubbing her genitals. The student sent her photos of his erect penis.  

The relationship between the pair eventually came to an end when Smith learnt about explicit photos of her circulating around the school.

The student told his mother who then called police leading to Smith's arrest.

The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to grooming a child for unlawful sexual activity, indecent assault of a person under 16 and intentionally sexually touching a child between 10 and 16.

Smith admitted she had been caught up in a range of online sexual encounters as she attempted to seek validation.  

She also had suffered from eating issues and had a fixation with her appearance, sometimes crying when looking at herself in the mirror.

Judge Kara Shead accepted the teacher had a borderline personality disorder and was seeking therapy, but said this did not reduce her moral culpability. 

The judge noted the 'absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child' and the serious breach of trust involved in Smith's conduct.

She had preyed on the victim and exploited his vulnerability. 

Courts must send 'a stern message' that sexual crimes against children, particularly by teachers, is unacceptable, the judge said.
