Dressed in one of her signature silk kimonos, the Cravings queen laid back against a pillow while discussing her new pregnancy revelations. 

'I didn't really know that bed rest was, like, in bed,' she admitted. 'I honestly thought bed rest was you have to really really really relax, stay home; I thought it could be couch rest.'

Teigen was first ordered on bed rest earlier this month after fears she couldn't feel her baby moving.

She went on to reveal that the third time around hasn't been as easy as when she was pregnant with Luna or Miles. 

'It's a bit of a difficult pregnancy,' she said. 'I feel good, though I will say I'm probably being punished for talking so much about how great the first two went.

'Now I get it. I get anyone that thinks it's not so awesome, but very happy to be carrying this baby.'
