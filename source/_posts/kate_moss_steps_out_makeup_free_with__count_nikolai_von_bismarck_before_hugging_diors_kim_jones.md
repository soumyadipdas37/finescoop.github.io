The fashion star recently returned to London after she had been isolating in her Cotswolds mansion with her daughter Lila, 17, alongside Kate's long-term partner Count Nikolai von Bismarck, 33, and her half-sister Lottie, 22.

The group were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown.

A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together.

'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.

'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'

The blonde has been sober for two years as she maintains a healthy lifestyle following decades of partying.

Kate was once known for her wild ways, but her longtime friend, DJ Fat Tony, has revealed she is now clean, with the pair having more fun now than ever before.

Her producer pal, 54 - who himself has been sober for 13 years - said in a new interview: 'Kate's been clean for over two years. Me and my sober mates now have a better time than we ever did when we used to drink and take drugs.'

Kate recently admitted she's tried to cut down on caffeine and nicotine, and enjoys having more quiet nights in.

Speaking to NBC's Megyn Kelly, the style icon revealed: 'I go to bed, I drink lots of water, not too much coffee, and I'm trying to cut down on cigarettes.'
