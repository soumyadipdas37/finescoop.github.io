Former Married At First Sight star Dean Wells is venturing into the world of political and cultural commentary. 

The 42-year-old is currently preparing to launch his own YouTube channel called Dangerous Ideas with Deano.

According to promotional photos shared to his Instagram, the show will critique topics like feminism, cancel culture and reality TV.

'It's time to fight back,' Dean wrote before sharing a link to subscribe to the channel.

The former TV groom seems to be taking the endeavour quite seriously and has even transformed his stylish living room into a makeshift studio.

Dean is already a fan of several right wing YouTube personalities, including transgender conservative Blaire White.

He recently called the 27-year-old his 'new fav youtuber' and urged his followers to subscribe to her popular YouTube channel, which already has almost 1million subscribers.

'An amazing trans woman who does not buy into the PC bulls**t of most of the PC "woke" culture,' he gushed.

'Hot too,' he added, followed by an emoji with heart-shaped eyes.

Dean previously came under fire for his views during his time on Married At First Sight, with some critics calling him 'misogynistic' and 'old fashioned'.

However, the creative director has hit back at the claims repeatedly, claiming to have been misrepresented on the show and stating that he's a lifelong feminist.

Dean appeared on the blockbuster fifth season of Married At First Sight back in 2018.

He was 'married' to Tracey Jewel on the show, but infamously had a fling with Instagram model Davina Rankin during filming, making the pair instant villains with viewers.

Since MAFS, he briefly appeared on Dancing With The Stars last year.  

Dean isn't the first former MAFS star to launch a YouTube channel, with season six's Mike Gunner briefly hosting his own Joe Rogan-inspired talk show on YouTube.
