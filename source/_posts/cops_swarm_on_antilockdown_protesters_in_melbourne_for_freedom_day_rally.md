A swarm of anti-lockdown protesters have been taken away in handcuffs after clashing with over-zealous police officers during a planned rally in Melbourne on Saturday.

Hundreds turned up to the 'Freedom Day' marches in the coronavirus-riddled city - demanding an end to the state's Stage Four Restrictions.

Those in attendance - with many refusing to wear a face mask - were quickly knocked back by a hoard of officers as a large number were arrested for breaching public health orders.

Dramatic footage shows demonstrators lying on the ground while officers struggled to detain them.

One crowd faced off with police on horseback as the chant 'Freedom' rang out outside the Shrine of Remembrance.

Ralliers were warned a large police presence would be seen if they attended the protests which defied the city's strict COVID-19 restrictions.

More to come.
