He's lost an incredible four stone after overhauling his lifestyle and finding a new love for fitness.

And Gregg Wallace has revealed that his younger wife Anne-Marie Sterpini, 34, was one of the reasons behind him shedding the pounds as he didn't want her to have a 'fat old husband'.

In a candid new interview, the Masterchef host, 55, also opened up about wanting to be 'fit and healthy' for their young son Sid, 16 months, after doctors warned him he was heading for a heart attack if he didn't change his ways.

Gregg has often showcased the fruits of his labour on social media, wowing fans with shirtless snaps following his amazing weight loss.

But behind his jaw-dropping posts on Instagram, Gregg has told how Anne-Marie and their son Sid have inspired him to be the best version of himself.

Speaking to Closer, Gregg who also has two grown-up children with ex-wife Denise, says his youngest child gave him the ultimate motivation to overhaul his physique.

He said: 'Having my baby boy made me want to be fit and strong. I can now go for long walks, which I wouldn't have been able to do before.'

Reason: Gregg, who married Anne-Marie, 34, in August 2016, noted that it is the almost 20-year age difference between them which drives him to be fit and healthy (pictured in 2013)

The TV star married wife Anne-Marie in August 2016 at a luxurious ceremony in Hever Castle in Kent.

And Gregg noted that it is the almost 20-year age difference between them which further drives him to be fit and healthy.

He continued: 'Anne being younger than me was even more of an inspiration to be fit - you can have an old husband but she didn't have to have a fat old husband.'

Aside from looking good for his wife of four years, the presenter received a big wake up call when he was informed he had dangerously high cholesterol and was at risk of having a heart attack. 

After dropping down to 12st, Gregg keeps up his weight loss with regular work-outs five times a week.

The star admitted that there are days when he didn't want to work up a sweat, but added that the fact he's fitter now than when he was in his 20s spurs him on to exercise.

He said: 'There are days when I lack motivation - but I still workout. I just look in the mirror and think "I'm 55 and I'm stronger now than I was at 25". I still struggle with some exercises, but I'm leaner now since lockdown.' 

Gregg's fitness journey has also inspired him to launch his own website showme.fit which helps others achieve a healthier lifestyle. 

On the platform, Gregg shares tips from his own personal fitness journey alongside exercise routines with his personal trainer.

His wife Anna provides extra healthy recipe ideas and there is additional nutritional and psychological advice to help users overcome their fitness challenges.

Since adopting his new lifestyle, Gregg revealed that he practices everything in moderation and still enjoys a pint of beer when he feels like it.

He said: 'When we slip up we tend to chuck it all in, but that’s not the way. You’re ­going to slip up. You’re going to go to the pub, drink too much and get a kebab on the way home.

'There is no way I’m going through the week without a pint of beer. But I’m careful most of the time and here I am, as fit as a butcher’s dog.'
