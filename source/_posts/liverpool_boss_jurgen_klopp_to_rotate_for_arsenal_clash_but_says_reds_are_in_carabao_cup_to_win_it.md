Jurgen Klopp 'hates' the perception certain games matter more to Liverpool than others 

Klopp faces Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta for the second time in three days on Thursday

And he confirmed he'll keep shuffling his pack for each fixture because of the demands on his squad.

Writing in his official programme notes for the Arsenal match, Klopp said: 'It is not a case of treating certain competitions as priorities over others. It's about managing the situation, the circumstances and the squad.

'It is likely we will make changes this evening but I hate that this is perceived in a way that certain games matter more than others. 

'This game tonight matters like you wouldn't believe. We want to win it with all we have, but the situation and circumstances cannot be ignored.'

The German coach faces a selection headache with a number of key players ruled out of the match.

Liverpool assistant boss Pepijn Lijnders confirmed earlier this week that Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and Kostas Tsimikas will not feature after failing to overcome their injuries in time. 

Summer signing Thiago Alcantara will also be absent after testing positive for coronavirus.

Klopp added: 'I have over 20 players for each match who, in my opinion, are good enough and have earned the right to play, but the rules mean I can only pick 11 to start each time.

'This is the hardest part of management when you are blessed to have such an incredible group of players.

 'We played on Monday just gone and we play again this Sunday coming. 

'We are fortunate to have players who can come in and our quality and approach not change even 0.1 per cent. For Arsenal I'm sure it is the same.'
