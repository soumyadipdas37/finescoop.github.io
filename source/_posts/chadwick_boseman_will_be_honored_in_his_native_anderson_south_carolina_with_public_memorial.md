Chadwick Boseman's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina will honor the late actor.

Reps with Mayor Terence Roberts' office told TMZ Monday that the late actor, who died Friday at 43 from colon cancer, will be honored with a memorial ceremony at an outdoor amphitheater and screening of his film Black Panther this week.

Mayor Roberts will speak at the ceremony, as will a local pastor and someone who attended high school with the actor.

In memory: Chadwick Boseman's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina will honor the late actor. The Mayor's office said that the late actor, who died Friday at 43 from colon cancer, will be honored with a memorial ceremony at an outdoor amphitheater and screening of his film Black Panther this week 

To take proper precautions with a public gathering amid the coronavirus pandemic, the amphitheater's capacity of 10,000 attendees will be reduced to 50 percent capacity in an effort to create social distancing space.

In addition, an enshrinement of the talented actor will be built in the town, officials told the outlet.

The memorial will also feature an array of local art produced of the famed actor, who also played Jackie Robinson in 42, TMZ reported. 

The news comes as a petition on Change.org amassed more than 16,431 signatures urging local officials to erect a statue of the late actor in place of a Confederate statue that remains on display in the city's downtown area.

Organizers noted Boseman's steadfast loyalty to the community after his breakout into super-stardom.

'Upon the release of his film Black Panther, Mr. Boseman took it upon himself to rent out a theatre in his home town of Anderson South Carolina to show the film for free,' organizers said. 'So that young boys and girls could be inspired by the film without the financial barrier.

'Mr. Boseman is without question an American treasure.'

'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much,' his family said in a statement. 'It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Panther.'
