She has launched a successful modelling career after being dubbed 'the most beautiful girl in the world' when she made her fashion debut as a child.

And Thylane Blondeau displayed her toned physique in a white bikini as she hit the beach with her new boyfriend in the south of France.

The fashionista, 19, showed off her washboard abs and long legs in the skimpy halterneck two-piece.

Thylane arrived at the beach in a black oversized T-shirt which she teamed with shorts and white trainers. 

The model and her boyfriend decided to take a hike along the coastline before stripping down to their swimwear for a spot on sunbathing.

Thylane, who tied her long hair back into a bun, appeared in high spirits as she playfully flirted with her new beau.
