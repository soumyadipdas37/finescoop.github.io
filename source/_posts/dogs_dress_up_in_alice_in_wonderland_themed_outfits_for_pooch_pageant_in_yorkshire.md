A collection of pooches donned costumes today as they put on a hilarious fancy dress dog show with a difference in Yorkshire.

Pooches of all shapes, sizes and breeds were dressed up in various outfits to be  crowned best king, queen, prince and princess at the 'Furbabies' event. 

Pet lovers were asked to dress their animals in Willie Wonka, Charlie and the chocolate factory themed costumes or Alice in Wonderland outfits.    

Organisers said the pageant, which was originally set to take place in April but was rescheduled amid the Covid-19 crisis, was held to raise money for a dogs rescue charity.

Others wore bold and bright costumes with enormous trains and colourful hats on the runway in Yorkshire 

Meanwhile Keegan the West Highland White Terrier donned a black top hat and red waistcoat as he dressed as The Mad Hatter

And it wasn't just the pooches! Some owners threw themselves into the spirit of the day by dressing up to match their puppies (pictured, Lily Blathorn with Keisha the Keeshond dog, dressed as the White Rabbit and Queen of Hearts)

Dogs could be put forward in 12 categories including best male and female pedigrees; best male and female puppies; and best rescue.

Among the adorable outfits worn by the cute creatures were a selection Alice in Wonderland themed costumes.

And meanwhile, others opted for a more majestic look, with Ruby the Boxer and Keisha the Keeshond both dressing as the Queen of Hearts.
