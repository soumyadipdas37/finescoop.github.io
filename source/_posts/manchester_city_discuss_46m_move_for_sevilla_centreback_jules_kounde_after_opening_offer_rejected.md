Manchester City have stepped up negotiations with Sevilla for their French centre back Jules Kounde.

Sevilla had rejected City’s opening offer and warned that they would need to pay the £82million buy out clause.

However, Kounde is interested in a move to City and Sevilla are now considering whether to sell for a compromise fee.

City have discussed a £46m offer while Nicolas Otamendi has been mentioned as makeweight

City have discussed a £46million offer while Nicolas Otamendi has been mentioned as a potential makeweight in any deal for the 21-year-old Kounde who only joined Sevilla from Bordeaux for £21m last summer.

Though he is a crucial part of their team, such a large profit made within 14 months of him joining may ultimately prove hard to resist.

Sources in Sevilla say though that would normally make good business sense, they recognise Kounde’s potential is huge after a stand out first season and they would push for more than £50m.

Sources in Sevilla believe, despite interest in Kounde, Jose Gimenez remains their priority

City had turned to the highly rated Kounde amid high valuations for Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly and Jose Gimenez of Atletico Madrid.

Despite their intensifying interested in Kounde, it is understood Gimenez is still considered City's priority.

The sources indicate that it is unlikely a deal will be done before Sevilla's Super Cup clash against Bayern Munich on Thursday.
