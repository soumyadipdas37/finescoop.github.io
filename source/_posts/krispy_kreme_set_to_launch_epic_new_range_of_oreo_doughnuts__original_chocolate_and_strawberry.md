Krispy Kreme and Oreo have teamed up in a super sweet collaboration to launch not one, but three new epic doughnuts across Australia.

The doughnut-duo brings together the iconic flavours of two of the world's popular brands to create Oreo Original, Oreo Chocolate and Oreo Strawberry doughnuts.

Each of the three creations come packed with a crème filling and topped with Oreo cookie pieces, setting it apart from any other doughnuts from Krispy Kreme's range.

Krispy Kreme and Oreo have teamed up in a super sweet collaboration to launch not one, but three new epic doughnuts - Oreo Original, Oreo Chocolate and Oreo Strawberry

Oreo Original: Signature doughnut with a smooth Kookies ‘N Kreme filling, topped with Oreo cookie pieces

Oreo Chocolate: Doughnut with choc crème filling, topped with choc icing and Oreo cookie pieces

Oreo Strawberry: Doughnut with strawberry crème filling, topped with strawberry icing and Oreo cookie pieces

Find an extra special surprise in the Oreo Original, with bits of Oreo layered in the filling for that extra crunch. 

The original doughnut plays on the popular flavours of vanilla and chocolate cookies and crème, which Krispy Kreme's food technologist Tasha Kaur saying it's one of Australia's most popular flavour combos, second only to the OG Original Glazed.

'We wanted to make everyone's favourite flavour combo bigger and better, and with Oreo we were able to play around with the additions of chocolate and strawberry,' she said.

'The doughnuts are light and fluffy, filled with a light as air cream, and then covered in the Oreo cookie pieces that gives it extra indulgence.

'We all know and love Oreo cookies, which is why we are so excited to give Aussies the chance to try them out in a new and unique way.'
