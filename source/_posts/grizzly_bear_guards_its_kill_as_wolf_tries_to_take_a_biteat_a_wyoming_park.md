A lone wolf bravely tried to steal a bear's kill from right under its nose, despite the grizzly's repeated efforts to scare off its opponent.

The grizzly bear at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, was tucking into its tasty meal when an intruding grey wolf tried to steal its kill on September 23.

The bear had buried the dead elk by the river's edge to cover the scent of the decaying carcass, but after a few days the wolves began to pick up on the scent.

And one courageous wolf decided to bravely approach the grizzly to try and steal its snack while the bear was napping, footage shows. 

In the video, the daring canine calmly sniffs the ground next to where the bear is lying, seemingly unfazed by its proximity to the giant mammal.

The canine quietly sneaks towards the elk and manages to steal a few bites while the bear remains sleeping. 

The bear quickly notices the intruding wolf's presence and leaps to its feet, sending the canine jumping backwards in fear.

But the grizzly surprisingly allows the predator to come extremely close to its kill before bothering to stand up and scare the canine away. 

The head-to-head stand-off in the video continues for almost four minutes, with the plucky wolf still showing no signs of standing down from the fight. 

Grey wolves, which can weigh up to 176lbs, are no match for the massive grizzly bear alone but can pose a threat in a pack.

The bear, which weighs up to 595lbs, are more powerful than wolves, but the canine  is considerably quicker than its opponent. 

Speaking about the footage, the contributor said: '791 recently took down the elk in the Yellowstone river and proceeded to bury it on the rivers edge to cover the scent of the decaying carcass. However, after a few days the wolves began to pick up on it.

'This wolf was alone and therefore not much of a threat to the massive grizzly. It was more of a game to him to see how close the dominating bear would let him get to his kill.

The grizzly bear scares off the wolf when it gets too close to its kill, which it had hidden in the dirt to hide the scent from other predators

'To my surprise, as proven by this image, he let him get very close. The wolf would slowly approach, the bear would make a slight shift in position, and the wolf would back off for awhile. This cycle occurred 4 times in my watching.'

Grizzly bears are normally extremely protective of their prey and will fight off other bears and mammals who threaten to steal their hunts.

But bears often come head-to-head with wolves as the two predators often hunt the same sort of prey.

Grey wolves mostly hunt large, hoofed animals including deer, mountain goats and elk.

Grizzly bears, who have an omnivorous diet, eating plants, roots and grasses, they can also become effective predators and hunt newborn elk, moose and deer.

The breed of bear has a more adaptable diet than the carnivorous grey wolf, as they can also survive on fish, berries, small rodents - and even human garbage if available.
