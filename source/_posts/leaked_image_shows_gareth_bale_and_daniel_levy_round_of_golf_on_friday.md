Tottenham fans were left putting in directions to Hadley Wood Golf Club after an image emerged on social media showing Gareth Bale, Daniel Levy and chief scout Steve Hitchin booked in for a round at the course on Friday. 

Bale is closing in on a sensational return to the club on a one-year loan deal which Sportsmail exclusively revealed to be worth in the region of £13m.  

Question marks over the validity of the image have been raised with allegations it could be photoshopped, and Sportsmail understands Bale is still in Madrid for final medical tests and is due to travel to north London in the next 24 hours.







The Hadley Wood course is close to Tottenham's Enfield training base and will be familiar to many in the first team squad. 

Bale, Levy and Hitchin had their names on the booking form which appeared online for a round teeing off at. 1.52pm - but with Bale with tests to complete in Spain, excited fans were left questioning if the image was a hoax. 

The Welshman has been exiled under boss Zinedine Zidane but he finally appears to have an escape route,  albeit a temporary one. 

Part of the move will be financed by Real Madrid – and Bale is relishing the prospect of reviving his career back in the Premier League.  



Relations soured between Bale and Zinedine Zidane and he almost left for China last summer

Bale was not expected to be at Real's training ground on Thursday after it was made clear he has no future at the club but was filmed driving inside the facility in his black Audi 4x4 in the morning. 

He worked out in the gym at Valdebebas on Thursday and is expected to fly to London on Friday. Bale's agent, Jonathan Barnett, said on Thursday: 'We're getting there, I think it will be completed this week.'  

Despite being close to an announcement, Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho refused to be drawn on the move when quizzed on Bale after a 2-1 win in Europa League qualifying against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Bulgaria.

'I can't comment,' he said. 'I don't comment on something that I don't know. For me, at this moment, until Gareth Bale is a Tottenham player I still think and respect the fact that he is a Real Madrid player. 

'I am not going to comment on a Real Madrid player.' 

 Bale was filmed arriving at Real Madrid's training ground early on Thursday morning

The Welshman became a fan favourite at Spurs where he scored 56 goals and provided 58 assists in 203 appearances before leaving for Real for a world-record fee of £86m in 2013.

In 2012-13 he was crowned Tottenham's Player of the Year and also claimed the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season award. 

Bale has won four Champions League titles in Madrid but has seen his relationship with manager Zinedine Zidane deteriorate so much that he has been completely cast aside.

He will be joined in north London by Sergio Reguilon, Real Madrid's left back.

Reguilon is due to undergo a medical and will sign a five-year deal with Tottenham paying a £27m fee.
