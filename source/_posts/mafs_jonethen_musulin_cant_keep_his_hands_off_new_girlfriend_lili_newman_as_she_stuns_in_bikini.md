He's just debuted his romance with stunning new girlfriend, Lili Newman. 

And on Monday, former Married At First Sight star Jonethen Musulin couldn't keep his hands off his girl as they frolicked at the beach. 

The 28-year-old, who 'married' Connie Crayden on the reality show, packed on the PDA with bikini-clad Lili as they took a dip at Tallebudgera Creek in Queensland.

Jonethen showed off his toned physique going shirtless in a pair of black board shorts.  

But all eyes were on Lili, who looked incredible in a yellow printed bikini which left little to the imagination. 

The brunette's tiny two-piece featured G-string bottoms and a bandeau-like top and showed off her circular tattoo on her left thigh.

The Queensland-based FIFO worker shared a series of snaps and videos taken while the couple spent time in Mount Tamborine.

What timing! Interestingly, his ex Connie (pictured) shared a photo with a mystery man to her Instagram stories just a few hours prior to Jonethen's upload

The exciting post saw his old MAFS co-stars flood his feed with congratulatory messages, which he liked and responded to.

KC Osborne commented 'Y’all are a bit cute', Ivan Sarakula wrote 'Big statement', while Steve Burley simply showed his support with three heart emojis.

Remember that? Jonethen and Connie called it quits at their final vows after weeks of Connie being the only one to vote stay at the commitment ceremonies

Sitting close to each other on a picnic rug, it's unclear if the mystery bearded man is dating the marine biologist, 28. 

The couple called it quits at their final vows after weeks of Connie being the only one to vote stay at the commitment ceremonies.

She delivered an empowering speech about self-love, and thanked her 'husband' for helping her to become a strong, confident woman.

During a March appearance on Today Extra, Connie confessed she had 'called it quits on the friendship' a few months after filming their final vows in December.
