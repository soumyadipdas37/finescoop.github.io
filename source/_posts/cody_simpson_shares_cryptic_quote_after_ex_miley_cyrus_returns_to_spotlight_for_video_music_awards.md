Cody shared a snap of an extract he was reading which also read: 'To live is a constant process of relating, so come on out of that shell of isolation and conclusion, and relate DIRECTLY to what is being said. '

The post comes just two days after Miley rocked the red carpet at the VMAs, which was held over several days to abide by strict COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.

Miley put on a sultry display in a sheer off-the-shoulder dress which was decorated with small mirrors.

The American hitmaker went on to perform her latest single Midnight Sky while swinging on a giant disco ball, in scenes reminiscent of her 2013 song Wrecking Ball. 

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.

In early August, Miley confirmed she split from Cody after less than a year of dating in an Instagram Live clip, telling fans the pair are taking time apart to 'work on' themselves.

Throwback! The American hitmaker went on to perform her latest single Midnight Sky while swinging on a giant disco ball, in scenes reminiscent of her 2013 song Wrecking Ball.

The American said she remains friends with Cody, who she has known for a decade.

'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so, don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza,' she said.

'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not.'
