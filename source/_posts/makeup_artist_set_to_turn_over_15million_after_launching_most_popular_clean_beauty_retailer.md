An Australian makeup artist who created a 'clean beauty' retailer in 2017 is set to turn over $1.5million three years later as more people turn towards using natural, high performing products.

Erin Norden, 37, launched the brick-and-mortar and online store for Clean Beauty Market at the same time in September 2017, with the brand experiencing year-on-year growth of 80 per cent ever since.

'My youngest daughter was eight months old at the time and I was taking leave to care for her when I had the idea,' Erin, who lives on the Gold Coast, Queensland, told FEMAIL.

'It dawned on me that we didn't have an actual physical space to shop natural yet high-performance brands in Australia,' Erin said

As a makeup artist and self-confessed beauty junkie Erin loved 'luxurious beauty shopping' and was 'sick' of doing all of her shopping in a health food store - but they were the only ones selling organic and cruelty-free items. 

'I wanted to shop brands and products with safe ingredients that were sustainable and cruelty-free but I didn't want to compromise on results or the luxury look and experience of brands and beauty shopping,' she said.

'My target market were women just like me, that were looking for more options in the natural beauty space and a storefront to come and try the products.'

Erin acknowledges that shopping purely online for beauty products is tough, so having and expanding a brick-and-mortar presence on James Street in Burleigh Heads was important to her

'Before the coronavirus we had people from all different states come and visit our store just so they can have that delightful beauty shopping experience and try before they buy,' she said.

'Sometimes they come purely to see our brands in person as they may have only seen them available online in Australia.'

Clean Beauty Market started with 20 brands but three years later they have over 70 leading labels from around the world in the categories of makeup, skincare, haircare, wellness and body.

Erin has a very strict criteria when it comes to brand curation and every label has to incorporate clean ingredients, sustainable values, and be cruelty-free

Some of the most popular brands the company stocks are Josh Rosebrook, Osea and Kjaer Weis because they deliver results without the use of harsh chemicals.

'It also has to work and be a delight to use and look at. You really can have it all, there are an abundance of amazing clean brands out there and we're lucky to have the best of the best,' she said. 

'I think people have gotten used to seeing a very limited amount of brands in Australia so they are excited to discover new favourites, particularly in an actual storefront.'

'It will help us maintain our position as the number one destination for clean beauty in Australia,' Erin said.
