Lindsey Vonn has proudly revealed her new smile while sharing graphic footage of herself getting veneers during her latest trip to the dentist.

The 35-year-old former Olympic skier took to Instagram on Monday to post a behind-the-scenes video of the procedure performed by Dr. Bill Dorfman, a Los Angeles-based cosmetic dentist who has appeared on ABC Extreme Makeover and Oprah. 

'I got new teeth. Thx Dr. Dorfman. CAUTION...some gross content,' she captioned the video compilation, which begins with the dentist drilling down her front teeth. 

Before and after: Lindsey Vonn, 35, shared a behind-the-scenes video of herself getting veneers on her two front teeth 

Process: The video beings with cosmetic dentist Dr. Bill Dorfman drilling down her teeth 

Dental veneers are wafer-thin shells of tooth-colored porcelain or composite that are cemented over the teeth to correct dental issues. 

When getting veneers for the first time, a dentist will trim down each tooth and remove the enamel before taking an impression of the teeth. The mold will then be used to create the veneers. 

In the video, Lindsey can be seen rubbing her tongue over her misshapen tooth after it was drilled down. 

'Wait... What?' she wrote.

Candid: Lindsey admitted that there was plenty of drooling the procedure 

Behind the scenes: Lindsey also shared an Instagram Stories video of one of her veneers being placed over her tooth 

The athlete explained that her two front teeth were 'ground' down while showing off her 'freaky' smile. She even shared footage of herself heavily drooling. 

'Do I dare see what it looks like?' she asked at the end of the procedure, but she was thrilled with the results. 

'Yay,' she said, smiling for the camera. 

Lindsey also took to Instagram Stories to share a close-up of her front teeth before she got new veneers as well as footage of the porcelain shells being placed over her teeth. 

Happy smile: Lindsey shared a before-and-after photo on her Instagram Stories

Something different: The video was a far cry from the glamorous display Lindsey put on back in February 2019 

She ended the clip with a before-and-after photo of her veneers, writing: 'See... Much better! Thx @DrBillDorfman.'

It is not known whether the world champion skier paid for her new pearly whites or whether the treatment was gifted to her - however if she did have to foot the bill it will likely have cost her a pretty penny. 

Veneers are considered a cosmetic procedure and are often not covered by dental insurance. 

Traditional porcelain veneers cost on average $925 to $2,500 per tooth and can last 10 to 15 years, according to the Consumer Guide to Dentistry. 

Meanwhile, composite veneers cost approximately $250 to $1500 per tooth but only last between five and seven years.
