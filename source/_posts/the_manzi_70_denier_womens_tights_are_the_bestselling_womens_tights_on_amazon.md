Finding tights that are comfortable, stay up, and are made to last seems like an endless pursuit. But hundreds of Amazon shoppers seem to have found a solution to these common problems with the Manzi 70 Denier Women's Tights.  

Reviewers describe the tights as 'durable, firm and completely opaque' with a 'buttery texture'. 

Not only are they comfortable and soft to touch, but the Manzi tights are only £12.99 for a pack of two or £15.99 for a pack of three. If you're heading back to the office, it might be wise to stock up. 

The Manzi 70 Denier Women's Tights have been designed with a control top meaning that you get added shapewear with every pair

There's nothing worse then investing in a pair of 'high-quality' tights for them only to rip on the first wear. While £12.99 for two pairs of tights isn't the cheapest price out there, we believe it's worth spending a little more to ensure your tights last longer. 

And Amazon reviewers seem to agree. One wrote: 'These are fantastic tights for a very good price. They fit perfectly are a lovely texture and look ( not too shiny ) but soft and opaque and the top has good control without being uncomfortable. 

'They also do not ladder as all of my other tights seem to do. I've given up buying any other tights as these are the best I have found.'

Denier 40 and higher is considered opaque, so with a rating of 70 denier the Manzi tights are definitely on the thicker end. If you're looking for sheer tights, this might not be the best set for you. 

However, as a general rule opaque tights are thicker so if you're looking for a more durable pair of tights that are less prone to laddering, these are a great option. 

The tights have also been designed with a control top meaning that you get added shapewear with every pair. The control section creates a slimming silhouette as it smooths out the areas on the hips, tummy and upper thighs. 

This has been a big hit with shoppers, with one raving: 'Tights are durable, firm and completely opaque. Perfect fit, long enough, the bit around belly generous in size, and holds everything in - no need for spandex!'

Shoppers have also reported that the Manzi tights hold their shape well, noting that they are comfortable enough to wear all day without falling down. 

'Love these tights,' one shopper wrote. 'They are so soft on the skin and fit very well. The comfiest tights I have ever had and they don't pinch the skin at all. So comfortable to wear all day with a buttery texture.'

Another agreed, writing: 'OMG! These tights are amazing. Great length, feel so smooth and don't fall down. I am a size 18 and ordered XL. 

'They are perfect. I like tights that go over the belly to give you that smooth line. These do just that. I'm so happy that I'm going to order some more.'
