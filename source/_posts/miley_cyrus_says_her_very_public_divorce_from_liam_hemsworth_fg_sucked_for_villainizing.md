Miley Cyrus opened up about her 'very public' divorce from Liam Hemsworth as she visited the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Wednesday. 

The 27-year-old star said the split 'f*****g sucked' because of the 'villainizing' she experienced in the press after the breakup became public. 

She also discussed being truly single for the first time in five years over a year after filing for divorce.

Cyrus spoke more of her relationship with Hemsworth, that started on the set of their film The Last Song in 2008 leading them to marry in 2018 before splitting after a few months of marriage in August 2019. 

'What really sucked about it wasn't the fact that me and someone that I loved realized that we don't love each other the way that we used to anymore,' the Midnight Sky singer said.   

Though the said 'That’s okay, I can accept that. I can't accept the villainizing, and just all those stories.' 

After the couple split last year, she had a very brief and public relationship with Kaitlynn Carter, and previously said she struggled with being portrayed as having cheated.

Weeks after starting her relationship with Carter, Cyrus then began a relationship with Cody Simpson in October of last year. 

Simpson and Cyrus announced they split in August, after 10-months of dating. 

Though she suggested that there was more time in-between her relationships than the public may realize. 

'It's amazing to me the public thinks that there's no gap of time that they didn't see that could possibly be what led to this,' she told Rogan. 

Can't accept: Though the said 'That’s okay, I can accept that. I can't accept the villainizing, and just all those stories' 

Single Cyrus: Cyrus reflected on being single for the first time in five years. After the couple split last year, she had a very brief and public relationship with Kaitlynn Carter, and previously said she struggled with being portrayed as having cheated. She then started dating Cody Simpson in October 2019 and split from him this August  

More to the story: 'It's amazing to me the public thinks that there's no gap of time that they didn't see that could possibly be what led to this,' she told Rogan

Adding:  'It's not, "One day you were happy on the carpet and the next day you were making out with your friend in Italy, what the f**k?" There's a lot of time in between that you didn't see.'

With her back to back relationships, the former Disney star said that this period of her life was the first time she had been single since 2015. 

Though moving forward she said 'I don't need to be in a relationship at all,' but if she chooses to find another partner she is interested in an 'older man.' 

'I don't need a man or a woman that's gonna take care of me, I can take care of me. I need them to be able to take care of them,' the singer added. 

Take care: 'I don't need a man or a woman that's gonna take care of me, I can take care of me. I need them to be able to take care of them,' the singer added 

In a recent episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast, Cyrus added that if she has a new relationship she need 'a calming [partner], I need an anchor, I need a weight.' 

Adding: 'Someone has to bring more to the table than their plate. They can't be like "fill me up" all the f*****g time. It's really important that I feel fulfilled.' 

Cyrus also made clear that she doesn't carry a torch for her former flames. 

'I think men in my life have told me I'm cold, I'm a cold f*****g bitch, because I leave when things are done,' she said. Adding: 'Im into a lot of freaky things, but I don't f**k dead guys and when it's over, you're dead to me and I move on.'
