Married At First Sight 'expert' Dr Trisha Stratford announced she would be leaving the show after seven seasons earlier this month. 

And on Wednesday it was announced that Puerto Rican sexologist Alessandra Rampolla will replace Trisha as Married At First Sight's newest relationship expert in 2021.  

The 46-year-old is already a huge name in her native Puerto Rico, boasting 677,000 Instagram followers and hosting her own show 'Dare with Alessandra'.

'I am thrilled to be joining John and Mel in Australia's biggest social experiment,' Alessandra said. 

'With my particular expertise, I hope to contribute to the complex mix of components that ensure marriages not only work but thrive in the long haul. 

'One of my strongest core beliefs is that sexual expression and compatibility are vital in building, nourishing and maintaining healthy romantic relationships, and it is my pleasure to help guide our participants in balancing this important factor in their brave quest for love.'

Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Alessandra was educated in the US and holds a master's degree in marriage and family therapy. 

She is now a clinical sexologist with over 20 years of experience and a number of published books.

Earlier this month, Dr Trisha Stratford announced she would be 'taking a step back from the series to focus on her writing, research and neuropsychotherapy'.  

A production insider told Daily Mail Australia that the New Zealand-based therapist was notably missing during the second and third stages of castings in August. 

Instead, participants were introduced to a 'American female sex therapist', who asked each of the stars what they were hoping to find in a match.

Married At First Sight's next season will be its eighth and is currently being produced by Endemol Shine Australia to premiere early next year.
