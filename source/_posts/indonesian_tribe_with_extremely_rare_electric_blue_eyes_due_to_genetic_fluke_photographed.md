An indigenous tribe on an Indonesian island who have uniquely piercing blue eyes due to a genetic fluke have been captured in a stunning set of photographs.

The Buton people are from Indonesia's 19th largest island, Buton Island, which is located in the southeast Sulawesi region of Indonesia. 

They are divided into several smaller tribes of which some have a rare condition known as Waardenburg Syndrome, which affects pigmentation.

This leaves them with electric blue eyes, something that is extremely rare in Indonesia, where most people have dark hair and dark eyes.
