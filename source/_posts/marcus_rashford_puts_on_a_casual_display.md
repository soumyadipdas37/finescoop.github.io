He made headlines when he forced a Government U-turn to ensure free school meal vouchers were provided to children throughout the summer.

And Marcus Rashford put on a casual display as he stepped out with his girlfriend Lucia Loi, 22, in Cheshire on Sunday morning. 

The England star, 22, put safety first with a black face mask and tracksuit bottoms as he made his way to a breakfast date with his beau.

The Manchester United forward opted for a black gilet layered over a simple t-shirt with white writing as he walked with his hands in his pockets down the street. 

Meanwhile Lucia looked chic in a black hoodie and leggings paired with white trainers and wore her brunette locks in a sleek ponytail. 

She carried her everyday essentials in a black satchel and opted for barely a scrap of makeup for the outing.

It comes after the footballer forced an embarrassing Government U-turn earlier this year to ensure free school meals were provided to children throughout summer.

He has since joined a child poverty task force backed by major supermarkets, is now pushing ministers to make a list of reforms to tackle child poverty. 

These include expanding the Free School Meals scheme, creating more school holiday activities for youngsters from the poorest backgrounds and raising the amount given to parents to help cover the cost of healthier foods.

Under his three-point plan, outlined in his letter to MPs, the striker wants to expand free school meals for every child in households on Universal Credit.

On-the-go: Marcus wants to expand holiday help for children on the Free School Meals scheme, with more food and activities - which would benefit more than one million children

He also wants to expand holiday help for children on the Free School Meals scheme, with more food and activities  - which would benefit more than one million children.

Marcus is also calling on the government to increase the value of Healthy Start Vouchers, which can be spent on milk, plain fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables, and infant formula milk, from £3.10-a-week to £4.25, while expanding the scheme to anyone on Universal Credit. 

The striker, who now lives in a £1.5million Cheshire mansion, grew up in a £150,000 terraced council house on the tough Northern Moor estate in Wythenshawe.

He cited his own experience of growing up on a council estate during his successful campaign to get the government to extend its Free School Meals throughout this summer.     

Support: Along with his school meals campaign, Rashford has already helped to raise £20million to fund 3.9million meals for vulnerable children in lockdown

Marcus Rashford was hailed as the hero of lockdown after his successful free school meals campaign became yet another unlikely victory for a young footballer who has already defied the odds to become one of England's top sportsmen. 

The 22-year-old star says leaving home aged 11 to join Manchester United's academy when his single mother Melanie struggled to feed the family has driven his campaign to ensure other children in the UK do not go hungry.  

Earlier this year, the England striker forced Boris Johnson into an extraordinary U-turn less than 24 hours after the Prime Minister refused to budge on finding £110million to give free school meals to £1.3million vulnerable children for six weeks over the summer.

Rashford hailed the news at the time, tweeting: 'I don't even know what to say. Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020.'

It caps an incredible lockdown for Marcus, who has used the past three months to recover from a double back fracture while also helping to supply three million meals for children out of school, raising around £20million along with charity FareShare. He is now joint-favourite to become BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Marcus, who earns £200,000-a-week at Man United and lives in a £1.8million mansion with a fleet of luxury cars, has not said how exactly much he has donated himself but admitted he started the fund with '£50,000 to £60,000' of his own money with Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and wealthy individuals handing over millions more.

He grew up in a £150,000 terraced council house on the tough Northern Moor estate in Wythenshawe, where the hit series Shameless was filmed in an area of Manchester that has suffered badly from high crime rates, poverty and drug problems.
