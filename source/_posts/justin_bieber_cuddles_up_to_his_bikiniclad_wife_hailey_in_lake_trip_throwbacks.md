Justin Bieber has been delighting fans with hints new music is coming next week, less than eight months after the release of his fifth studio album.  

But the 26-year-old pop-star made sure he took time on Friday to show appreciation for his wife Hailey. 

Taking to Instagram, the Sorry singer shared a cozy snap with the 23-year-old on a boat. 

Piece of success: Justin Bieber made sure he took time on Friday to show appreciation for his wife Hailey as he hinted at new music dropping next week

The photo, which was posted by Hailey earlier this week, seems to be from the couple's cross-country adventures and their stop in Idaho. 

While out on the water in a small white boat, Justin wrapped his arms around Hailey's shoulders as she sat clad in a black triangle bikini. 

Justin left the photo caption-less but Hailey wrote 'last few weeks were equal parts dreamy and adventurous,' alongside the photo and an a few other throwbacks. 

His posting came just hours after he posted a single blue-hued photo in a geometric striped outfit, which he captioned '1 week.' 

The drop: His posting came just hours after he posted a single blue-hued photo in a geometric striped outfit, that he captioned '1 week' before posting a link to jbsoon.com allowing fans to save an unknown song before its release

He shared the same message on his Instagram story and Twitter, with no elaboration sending fans speculating. 

Scooter Braun, Justin's longtime manager, added to the mystery as he retweeted his message adding '#newerabegins???'

Shortly after, Justin seemed to confirm that new music was coming as he shared  links to the website jbsoon.com, which allows fans to pre-save an unknown song to Spotify and Apple Music. 

Later in the day, Justin shared a green-hued image sitting in his luxury van, captioned 'won't let u go.' (sic) 

Back-to-back: Justin last released his fifth studio album, Changes, on February 14 which debuted at the top of the Billboard Hot 200 

Twelve hours after sharing his original message, it garnered 158k likes and 35.9k retweets on Twitter, and his Instagram post earned 898k likes in six hours. 

Fans seemed excited and unsure about the hints writing 'WTF IS HAPPENING IN ONE WEEK,' and 'BIEBER IS COMING TO SAVE THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.'

Justin last released his fifth studio album, Changes, on February 14 which debuted at the top of the Billboard Hot 200.   

The album became Bieber's seventh number one, making him the youngest to accomplish the time at 25-years-old. The record was previously held by Elvis Presley at age 26. 

Change of plans: Changes spawned his Billboard Hot 100 number two, Yummy, and he was expected to tour the album from May to September with Kehlani and Jaden Smith, though dates were scheduled to 2021 due to the pandemic (pictured January 2020)

Changes spawned his Billboard Hot 100 number two, Yummy, and he was expected to tour the album from May to September with Kehlani and Jaden Smith, though dates were scheduled to 2021 due to the pandemic. 

For additional album promotion he also starred in the Justin Bieber: Seasons, 10-episode documentary series on Youtube where he discussed the pressure he had early in his career to be successful.  

Prior to his fifth studio album, he last released Purpose in 2015 and toured from 2016 until 2017 before ending tour early to focus on his mental health.  

After a very long break from music, he returned to the stage for surprise performance at Coachella during Ariana Grande's headlining set in April 2019.
