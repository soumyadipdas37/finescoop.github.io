The boss of retail giant Myer is the latest business leader to slam under-fire Daniel Andrews over his roadmap out of lockdown as his public popularity as Victorian Premier plummets.

A new poll has revealed Labor would lose the state election if it was held today over the Premier's handling of the state's horror second wave of coronavirus in Melbourne.

A MediaReach poll of more than 3000 voters in five marginal Labor seats, including the electorate of Deputy Premier James Merlino revealed they would all be lost.

Labor would lose the state election with Liberals well ahead with 61.18 per cent of the vote on a two party-preferred basis.

'It was the government just collecting and disseminating information as opposed to a consultation,' he told the publication.

'We all found it very frustrating.'
