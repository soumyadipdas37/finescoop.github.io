Jamie Foxx has playfully told his former TV love interest Garcelle Beauvais they 'should have been together' in real life.

The dynamic duo starred opposite each other on the sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show which ran five seasons on The WB from 1996 to 2001.

Now while appearing on her podcast Going To Bed With Garcelle, Jamie, 52, bantered with The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, that when he sees her with another man he thinks he 'f***ed up.'

Both of them declared themselves 'single' on the podcast, as did decorator and stylist Mayasha Long who was Jamie's fellow guest on that episode.

During the cheerful conversation Garcelle told Jamie: 'By the way, you never really give any guy that I’m with any real attention.'

He dished that this was 'Because me and you, we should’ve been together. So every time I see him, I was like: "Damn, I f***ed up."'

The result is that whenever he meets a beau of hers 'I give him a real s***y look,' to which Garcelle said: 'I feel it! I feel it and they feel it.'

Remember when: Garcelle revealed in 2013 that 'when we worked together we had made a pact that we weren't gonna date'; they are pictured at a benefit in 1996

Jamie and Garcelle jokingly agreed they are 'in a relationship forever,' and she vamped that he is 'also hung like a horse.'

Several years ago Garcelle appeared on HuffPost Live and explained why her onscreen pairing with Jamie never became a real-life romance.

'It's funny 'cause when we worked together we had made a pact that we weren't gonna date because it would be awkward. If it didn't work out and we still have to work together, that would be-,' she said.

'So I got engaged two weeks before the show wrapped and he was like: "You couldn't wait?"' Garcelle recalled with a laugh.

Remember when: Garcelle married her talent agent second husband Mike Nilon in May 2001, four months after The Jamie Foxx Show ran its finale; she and Mike are pictured in 2005

At that point she was promoting her and Jamie's 2013 movie White House Down which reunited them onscreen as the president and first lady.

She explained that 'now we're like brother and sister, and it's - we have a great relationship so I wouldn't wanna mess that up.'

Garcelle married her talent agent second husband Mike Nilon in May 2001, four months after The Jamie Foxx Show ran its final episode.

Her first marriage to producer Daniel Saunders lasted from 1991 to 2000, eating up most of the run of her sitcom with Jamie.

Jamie's last confirmed public relationship was with Katie Holmes, whom he split from in 2019 with breakup reports circulating that August.

They only went public as a couple in 2017 although conjecture had been spreading that they were an item since 2013.

There were rumors that Katie's 2012 divorce agreement with Tom Cruise banned her from publicly dating anyone for five years thereafter.
