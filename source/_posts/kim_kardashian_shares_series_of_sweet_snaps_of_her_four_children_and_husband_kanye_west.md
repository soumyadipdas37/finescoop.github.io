She enjoyed a romantic dinner date night with Kanye West next to a massive tent structure, lit by the lights of their car.

And one day later, Kim Kardashian shared a series of sweet snaps of her four kids plus one with their dad Kanye.

The 39-year-old captioned the adorable images she shared Tuesday with: 'How did I get so lucky?!?!?!'

Kim and Kanye are parents to four kids: daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, four, and Psalm, one year.

In the images, North donned a purple sweater with taupe colored slides and her hair up in twin buns.

In several of the images, she was holding her younger brother Psalm in her arms; the toddler donned a neutral hued top with matching bottoms.

Saint rocked a camouflage patterned top with neon shorts and slides while sister Chicago wore similar colors for her tee and overalls look. 

One image showed Kanye smiling as he crouched down near Psalm, with another pictured featuring North with Chicago.

One day prior, Kanye revealed that he and Kim were dining outside next to a massive tent structure in a tweet. 

'Dinner for 2,' Kanye captioned his photo, while adding an emoji of a dove carrying an olive branch, possibly to signal he was taking steps to rekindle their romance following his travels without the family and his efforts to run a doomed presidential campaign.

Kim later retweet her husband's post, captioning it with two dove emojis.

The rapper's photo showed their car outside of a tent building at night, with a small table featuring two chairs arranged just outside by the vehicle. 

 He didn't make clear what the building or another tent-like structure next to it were supposed to be, but a round entranceway revealed the interior was painted a shade of royal blue and showed an upright piano, possible to serenade his wife with.

Kanye's romantic gesture came after Kim shared some gorgeous black and white photos he had taken of her earlier in the day.

The images, which were for the UK-based publication AnOther Magazine, showed the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star in a set of underwear, possibly her own Skims, and jewelry designed by her friend Michèle Lamy.

Kim's newest date night with her husband follows reports that she's 'sad' that he has been struggling with his mental health.

The reality star is reportedly worried about the 'vicious cycle' her husband is experiencing, after a series of bizarre Twitter rants.

A source said: 'She is deeply disappointed and sad because Kanye is struggling. It's a vicious cycle that Kim has had success at interrupting successfully for months at a time.'

An insider added to Us Weekly magazine: 'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn't healthy for Kanye ... She doesn't care about the tweets, that is Kanye being Kanye. The mood swings and the manic episodes that are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'
