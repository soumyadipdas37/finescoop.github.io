Sales of weighted blankets have soared over the past couple of years thanks to claims that suggest they help with a better night's sleep, anxiety and stress.

The gentle pressure of the weights sewn into the blanket is similar to the feeling of being hugged, instantly making you feel comforted and cosy. It's this feeling that's said to reduce anxiety and therefore help you get a better quality sleep.

While some weighted blankets can be priced as high as £200, Amazon shoppers have found an affordable solution with the Brentfords Weighted Blanket. 

Currently priced at only £22.99, it's received a near-perfect average score of 4.7 out of 5 with shoppers calling it a 'life-changer' and a 'real comfort'. 

Shoppers are calling the Brentfords Weighted Blanket a 'life-changer' and claim that it has helped settle anxiety symptoms and aid a better nights sleep 

While scientific evidence is fairly inconclusive, many swear-by a weighted blanket, waxing lyrical over its benefits. It's especially popular with those that have restless nights and that suffer from anxiety and stress. 

It's worth noting that a weighted blanket won't be a cure for medical conditions but could be an affordable way to help manage symptoms. 

Feeling comforted and safe is one of the biggest benefits of the Brentfords Weighted Blanket. The plush quilted blanket has equally stitched pockets for an even spread over your body. Weighing 6kg, it comes in at a similar weigh to other blanket but at a fraction of the price. 

For those that like to be warm and snuggly in bed or on the sofa, then the Bedfords Weighted Blanket won't disappoint. Unlike some other blankets, this is quilted so is a lot softer and more comforting than others, allowing you to cuddle up and relax. 

With over 500 reviews, praise for the weighted blanket comes in thick and fast, with many raving about how it's transformed their sleep and calmed their anxiety.  

'This weighted blanket is amazing. It has improved my sleep quality and helped settle my anxiety symptoms of a night as it’s quite heavy. The blanket isn’t restrictive at all, and I would 100% recommend this to any anxiety sufferers out there!'

'Bought this for my daughter as she was struggling with sleep and anxiety' wrote another shopper in their five-star review. 'She used it for the first time last night and said she had the deepest and most restful sleep ever!! She is in love with it!! I have ordered one for my other teen now too. May even treat myself.'

The blanket distributes the 6kg weight evenly across your entire body, creating a calming, snuggle effect that shoppers claim helps get 'the most restful night's sleep ever'

A third wrote: 'Great blanket, soft and very comfortable. Sleeping like a baby now, less anxiety and overthinking lying in bed. Now I'm asleep in under 5 mins and not waking up once. Try one if you are having sleeping problems, well worth the gamble.'

While heavy, the stylish looking blanket keeps you warm and cosy rather than sweaty and restrictive. Many have found comfort in the weight, finding that it helps drift you off to sleep, even helping those with sleeping conditions like night terrors.

'After suffering from nightmares, night terrors and severe night sweats from stress and anxiety, I was excited to try this blanket. It has been incredible! My stress and anxiety at night has reduced dramatically, so I no longer suffer from nightmares, terrors or night sweats. I am sleeping through the night, whereas before I’d usually wake every hour. This blanket has been a lifesaver!'

The Brentfords Weighted Blanket has even been a hit with those that suffer from joint pain. 

'Great blanket! Looked into weighed blankets for help with aches due to arthritis and anxiety. This helps both, it cradles your joints which helps with aching pains that wake me and stay in place all night. Really soothing for anxiety, the weight is grounding without smothering. Good weight but you don't feel any lumps or the glass beads so very comfortable!'
