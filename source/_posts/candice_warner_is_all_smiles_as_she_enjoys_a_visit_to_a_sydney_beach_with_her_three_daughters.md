Candice Warner enjoyed a girls' day out with her three daughters on Thursday. 

The 35-year-old WAG was accompanied by Ivy Mae, five, and Indie Rae, four, and Isla, one, as they visited a Sydney beach. 

Dressed in a black one-piece swimsuit and unbutton blue, denim shorts, Candice was all smiles as she watched her children play in the shallows.

The blonde stunner showed off her trim pins and lithe figure as she stood on the shore. 

She added a number of gold accessories and a black watch to her simple, beachy ensemble. 

The former Iron Woman appeared makeup-free for her outing, and wore her flaxen locks in a loose ponytail.

After playing in the water, the little girls were wrapped in towels and led off the beach by their protective mum, who carried a number of beach toys in a bag.

Last week, David paid tribute to his wife in an Instagram post shared with his many fans.  

'When time flies, you sometimes forget to reflect on how lucky we are, especially when you look back at memories,' he wrote. 

The sportsman explained that 'six years and three children later' he still loves to reminisce about all the reasons why he married his 'soul mate and best friend'.   

David and Candice were married in 2015 at Terrara House Estate winery on the New South Wales South Coast.
