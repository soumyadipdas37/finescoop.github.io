Earlier this month it was announced that Channel Nine's Millionaire Hot Seat was relocating to Queensland from coronavirus-stricken Melbourne.

And on Tuesday, the quiz show's production crew were seen inside the Gold Coast Convention and Entertainment Centre in Broadbench wearing precautionary face masks to resume filming for the next seven weeks.

The drastic measure to move the Eddie McGuire fronted show to a different State came after TV Tonight reported it was denied access to Docklands Studios in Melbourne following a coronavirus outbreak on set of The Masked Singer, which is also filmed there.
