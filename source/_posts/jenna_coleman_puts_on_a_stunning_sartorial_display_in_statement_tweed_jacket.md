Jenna Coleman might have just been popping to the shops on Monday, but that didn't stop her having a serious fashion moment. 

The Victoria star, 34, looked incredible wearing a statement tweed jacket which had an orange pattern running throughout. 

Showing off her tanned legs in a pair of black shorts, she opted for comfort wearing a pair of fleece-lined Birkenstock sandals.

Paying homage to her royal character, Queen Victoria, she carried a very patriotic Union Jack Christian Dior book tote. 

The item is currently sold out but can be found on resale sites for up to £3,300.

Jenna looked every inch the superstar wearing her hair down and glossy, along with a dark pair of sunglasses.

It's been a tumultuous time for Jenna as earlier this month, she and her ex, fellow actor Tom Hughes, 35, were pictured moving out of their London home.   

The couple shocked fans when they split in July - having been a couple - on and off-screen - for four years.

But things seemed to be made final as the Victoria stars dealt with matters at their former shared property.

The actress and her Victoria co-star fell in love on set while playing the lead roles of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the ITV period costume drama.

But they are thought to be keeping things amicable between them. 

An insider told The Sun that the pair have since met up in an attempt to keep things 'as friendly and civil as possible.' 

The source said: 'They are trying to salvage a friendship but obviously these are trying times, and it's not easy. 

'Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. There was no third party involved.  

'Jenna's career is going from strength to strength, she's being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she's still young.'
