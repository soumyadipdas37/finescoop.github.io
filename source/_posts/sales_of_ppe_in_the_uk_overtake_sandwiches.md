Rocketing sales of PPE have overtaken sandwiches during the pandemic to become an £8.7billion industry, analysis has revealed.

Mandatory mask-wearing has caused the booming PPE sector to surpass the beleaguered sandwich industry which was estimated at £8billion pre-crisis.

Manufacturers of PPE are among the few businesses to have thrived in recent months as coronavirus drove demand for face coverings and hand sanitiser. 

ViraxCare, a manufacturer that carried out the analysis, says the sector has ballooned at breakneck speed.

James Foster, chief executive, said: 'Almost overnight PPE has become ubiquitous. Never has an industry broadened so quickly, quite so urgently. 

'The result is that its market has exploded, overtaking everyday items at a blistering pace.

'Bosses have a lot to think about when employees return to work, including cleaning regimes, testing, and, of course, PPE. 

'The most prepared companies will integrate those things into the daily lives of staff almost seamlessly, and the subscription model is going to be the key to that, particularly for SMEs.'
