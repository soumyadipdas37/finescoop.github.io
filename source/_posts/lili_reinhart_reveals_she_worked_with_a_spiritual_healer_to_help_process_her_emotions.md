Lili Reinhart has revealed that she saw a spiritual healer amid the coronavirus pandemic to better cope with the stress of the past year, which included a public breakup with her Riverdale co-star Cole Sprouse. 

The 23-year-old actress, who covers the September issue of Nylon, told the magazine that she worked with the healer and clairvoyant while visiting Mount Shasta, California, on her first solo trip. 

'She is what's called a frequency healer,' Reinhart said. 'She taught me how to meditate properly, how to really connect to my body, and the world around me, and nature… It was very spiritual for me, really connecting me to my Christian roots, and also just to myself. It felt like a good way to wrap up the last couple months of my life.'

Candid: The 23-year-old Riverdale star told the publication that she worked with a healer in Mount Shasta, California, while on her first solo trip 

Reinhart and Sprouse, 28, initially separated in January after two years together and broke up in March, right at the start of the global crisis. 

While dealing with both the end of her relationship and self-isolation in quarantine, her new puppy, Milo, needed emergency surgery in April after being attacked by another dog. 

'I've been through some shit, the last year, a lot of loss,' she said. 'I needed to learn self-love, basically. It's a very hard thing to do. How the f**k do you love yourself?' 

Reinhart embarked on the solo journey after spending four months in quarantine in her Los Angeles home, her longest break since she took on the role of Betty Cooper on the CW's teen drama Riverdale. 

Important: Reinhart said the healer taught her how to 'meditate properly' and 'really connect' to her body, the world around her, and nature

Goal: The actress explained she had 'a lot of loss' this past year and 'needed to learn self-love'

'I literally Googled "mental health retreat,"' she said of choosing her destination, where she spent three days in a Best Western. 

While looking for mental clarity in Mount Shasta, her healer helped her discover that she might be an empath. Empaths are highly sensitive individuals who have the ability to sense and feel others' emotions as if they're part of their own experience.   

'I've always known I'm intuitive,' Reinhart explained. 'She also told me that I could be clairvoyant and telepathic, if I worked on my skills. It was very validating in making me feel like, "Oh, s**t! I really do have a power to connect with peoples' energies."' 

The actress, who has struggled with depression since she was 12, was candid about her mental health at the beginning of the pandemic, saying she 'felt very lost.' 

Intuitive: The healer also helped her discover that she might be an empath. Empaths are highly sensitive and have the ability to sense and feel others' emotions as if they're their own 

Peace: 'It was very spiritual for me, really connecting me to my Christian roots, and also just to myself. It felt like a good way to wrap up the last couple months of my life,' she said of the trip

Search: Reinhart said she chose to visit Mount Shasta after Googling 'mental health retreat' and spent three days in a Best Western 

'I felt very sad and hopeless, because of personal things that were happening in my life,' she said. 'Instead of distracting myself, f**king random people and doing drugs and drinking my problems away, I chose the harder route, which was to not distract myself. 

'I was like, "I’m not doing that. I’m going to go through the next however many months of s**t, pure s**t, awful, crying every day, but the necessary work."'

Reinhart has two personal projects to celebrate: the August release of her film Chemical Hearts, which starred in and executive produced, and the publication of her first book of poetry, Swimming Lessons, on September 29.  

She has also been called back to film the end of Riverdale's fourth season, but she was admittedly less than pleased to be heading back to work to Vancouver, Canada. 

Looking back: Reinhart shared photos from her trip on Instagram earlier this month 

'Took a solo trip to Mount Shasta for some mental clarity and healing. Very grateful to have the opportunity to travel to such a sacred place and reconnect with myself and God,' she wrote

'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn’t feel good,' she said. 

'You can’t go home for Thanksgiving, can’t visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f****d.' 

The star also lamented having to fit into a prom dress she wore in an episode before filming was halted because she’s a bit curvier than she was before the pandemic.

'We stopped during the prom episode, so I have to fit back in that prom dress. Five months later, we’re all going to be tan, maybe a little bit thicker. I certainly am,' she said.

Saying goodbye: Reinhart and her Riverdale co-star Cole Sprouse initially separated in January after two years together and broke up in March, right at the start of the global crisis 

Scary: While dealing with both the end of her relationship and self-isolation, her new puppy, Milo, was attacked by another dog in April and needed surgery

Honest: Reinhart admitted that she feels 'like a prisoner' while having to be separated from friends and family as she resumes filming Riverdale in Vancouver, Canada

'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn’t feel good. You can’t go home for Thanksgiving, can’t visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f****d.' 

Despite her grievances, she acknowledged she is 'very lucky' to have the show to return to as other people have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. 

Reinhart and her co-stars are set to finish filming the final three episodes of season four, before beginning immediately on season five, which will take place seven years in the future as they leave their high school days behind them.

They'll have to quarantine separately for two weeks before filming starts, and once they begin filming they'll work until after Christmas.
