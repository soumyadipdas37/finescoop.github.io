A wife has been left in hysterics after her husband created an evening meal for their children featuring slices of cheese, cucumbers, carrot and ham with 'Baby Shark' inspired fins made out of Oreo cookies.

The Australian woman shared a photo of her children's dinner plates on the Mums Who Cook, Clean and Organise Facebook page, laughing at the creative work her partner had done. 

'When you're feeling unwell and your husband makes the kids' dinner. Me: Looks great hun, what's with the Oreos? Hubby: Baby shark... do do do do do do,' She captioned the images.

There were fruits and vegetables on the plate, with some meat, marshmallow creations and cheese but it was the addition of the Oreo cookies that made her laugh - inspired by the Korean children's song Baby Shark.

South Korean children' education company Pingfong helped the Baby Shark chant go viral in 2017, with K-pop bands performing versions of it at their concert. 

Naturally many of the parents in the comments said they could relate to the dinner plate, particularly on evenings where they weren't feeling up to making an extravagant meal.

'I bet the kids ate it all too. Good work Dad!' One person said.

'The creativity here is awesome,' said another.

A third added: 'Oh Bless, he tried. What a great hubby. I bet the kids loved it'.

Australian dietitian Susie Burrell has previously shared her ideal children's dinner on a plate, leaning towards a mixture of carbohydrates, protein and fat. 

'While we often lean towards pasta and rice-based dishes, unless your child is especially active and involved in sports for more than an hour or more each day, a nightly meal of a palm size serve of protein (fish, chicken, eggs, beans or meat) and 2-3 vegetables or salad is all they need,' she said.

This could translate to being a piece of white fish with vegetables or some chicken cutlets with salad.

If they complain of being really hungry, add a handful of pasta to keep their dinner balanced.
