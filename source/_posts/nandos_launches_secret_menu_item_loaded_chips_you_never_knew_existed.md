Nando's Australia has unveiled a never-before-seen indulgent food item on its 'secret menu' - but you'll have to be quick because it won't be around for long.

The restaurant chain has created the ultimate 'loaded chips' for just $9 - complete with its signature PERi-PERi chips, juicy grilled capsicum, tomato and onion, topped with a dollop of creamy aioli, smoky relish and finished with a tangy feta cheese.

For those feeling extra hungry, diners can customise the dish by adding a protein such as grilled PERi-PERi chicken tenders, a plant-based 'Great Pretender' or a 'superfood' veggie patty. 

Nando's has unveiled a never-before-seen food item on its 'secret menu' called 'loaded chips'

'We're always experimenting with flavours and textures, and loaded chips are no exception,' Nando's head of food Mario Manabe said.

'Knowing our fans can't get enough of our PERi-PERi Chips, we put the call out on Instagram to get people's opinions on toppings, which was great fun and helped solidify the mix of flavours we chose. 

'The richness of the aioli and feta paired with the smokiness of our capsicum relish really elevates this dish to something special.

'Our loaded chips are super delicious on their own, but if you're feeling extra hungry, you can also customise the dish by adding one of our amazing protein options.'

Self-proclaimed burger expert Jimmy Hurlston - who documents his food adventures at Jimmy's Burgers on Instagram - said the loaded chips are 'seriously next level'.

'The bite from the grilled veg mix and spice from the PERi-PERi Salt, combined with the creamy aioli and sharp tang of feta makes for whole new taste experience.

'I'm no stranger to a plate of loaded chips - but this is about as good as it gets and I'll be loading up while I can.'

However, diners will not find this item anywhere in stores as it's only found exclusively on the 'secret menu' in the restaurant's new app.

To get your hands on the dish, you need to sign up to become a PERi-Perks loyalty member and you'll be rewarded exclusive access to member-only offers, freebies on your birthday and earn one point for every $1 spent.

Simply jump on the app, online or head to your local store as the secret menu item is now available at all restaurants for dine-in and takeaway, or via Nando's delivery until Wednesday, November 4. 

The loaded chips are yours for dine-in or takeaway for $9 without protein, $13 with grilled chicken tenders or superfood veggie patty, or $14 with a Great Pretender.
