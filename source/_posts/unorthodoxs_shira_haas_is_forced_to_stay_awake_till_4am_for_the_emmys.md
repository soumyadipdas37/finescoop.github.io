The great and good of Hollywood gathered virtually for the 72nd Annual Emmy Awards, with many appearing from their LA homes.

Yet the event was not quite so straight forward for Unorthodox's Shira Haas, who was forced to stay awake till 4.15am as she chatted from her home in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Sure to impress, the Israeli actress, 25, who was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her work on the Netflix limited series, looked incredible in a Chanel dress which took an eye-watering 1,200 hours to create. 

Emmy stunner! The 72nd Annual Emmy Awards was not quite so straight forward for Unorthodox's Shira Haas, who was forced to stay awake till 4.15am as she chatted from her home in Tel Aviv, Israel

Shira plays Esty, a 19-year-old Jewish woman who runs away from her Ultra-Orthodox community in New York City to start a life in Berlin.  

Sure to steal the show despite missing out on her gong, Shira donned an embroidered organza and chiffon bustier dress from Chanel's stunning Spring-Summer 2020 Haute Couture collection.

The dress required 1,200 hours of work with more than 20,000 elements, including embroidery with hand cut and painted organza petals in pink, yellow and green 

Back in April, Shira recalled her shock and nerves at having to shave her head for the powerful Netflix drama series.

Reflecting on the role, Shira - who was born in Tel Aviv to a Jewish family told British Vogue that she didn't know about many of the practises in this community, including shaving your head after marriage. 

Recalling having to be filmed having her hair shaved, Shira confessed she was shocked to learn it would be one of the first scenes she shot.

She recalled: 'That was the final scene on the first day. When Maria [Schrader, the director] told me it was going to happen right at the beginning, I was so shocked. 

Wow! She looked incredible in a Chanel dress which took an eye-watering 1,200 hours to create

'But, it was great because it really got me into character. Of course, your head can only be shaved once so I knew it would be one take and I had to get it right. 

'I was nervous, but I was willing to do it in order to tell this story.'

The reason why Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women shave their heads has been disputed, with  Rabbi Avram Mlotek telling Refinery29 that some religious interpretations determine 'woman's hair to be nakedness and part of the alluring nature of the effeminate.'  

Other websites about Jewish tradition and culture state that the only person who should see a married woman's hair is her husband.

One to watch: Back in April, Shira recalled her shock and nerves at having to shave her head for Netflix drama series, Unorthodox

Shira spent months researching the Ultra-Orthodox community, explaining to Vogue, 'every Jewish community is different and you really can’t generalise.'

The actress revealed she travelled to Berlin two months before filming began in order to learn Yiddish, which she revealed is 'very different' to her native Hebrew.

Shira also had to take piano and singing lessons in preparation for the role, and several consultations with the show's religious consultant, revealing that the cast rehearsed for two full days before filming the wedding scene to ensure it looked authentic.

Unorthodox tells the story of a young woman named Esther 'Esty' Shapiro, [Shira Haas] who decides to flee the Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsberg.

She flees to start a new life in Berlin, Germany away from her arranged marriage to Yanky [Amit Rahav], who tries to track her down and win her back.

He enlists the help of his rule-breaking and sinister cousin, Moishe Lefkovitch, played by Jeff Wilbusch. The series is loosely based on a true-story memoir Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection Of My Hasidic Roots by Deborah Feldman.
