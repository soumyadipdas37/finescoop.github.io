Carlos Carvalhal says his son is his hero. He and Jose Carlos were already close but after that night, the bond is even tighter.

That night was in July when, after returning to his home following a game with Rio Ave in Madeira, Carvalhal was attacked as he stepped out of his car by masked men, one brandishing a knife.

Gamely, 54-year-old Carvalhal wrestled two of them to the ground. Scrambling on the gravel pathway, cutting his arms and legs, he shouted out for help as the third approached menacingly with the knife. His 23-year-old son, Jose, ran to his aid and pelted the men with stones.

The 54-year-old spoke candidly about his terrifying experience alongside his son in July 

'His intervention was crucial,' says Carvalhal. 'He surprised them and they ran when he threw the stones. I was fighting very well with the two guys, they weren't causing me too many problems but when I saw the third had a knife... I had screamed out for help and Jose came. Luckily, we managed to get inside the house and the police arrived within minutes.

'Jose was my hero. We were close before but, going through that together, it has created a special bond.’

Such a threat to the safety of the former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City manager and his family prompted Carvalhal to ramp up security around his home.

Yet alarm bells were going again days later.

'I'd had new windows, locks, video cameras and even a panic button installed. Then, unbelievably, a drone started flying over my house. After what had happened I thought they are coming again but it turned out to be the local council checking out the area for work on the road.'

Understandably, Carvalhal is reluctant to dwell on the attack.

He has just come off the back of a record-equalling season as coach of unfancied Rio Ave, guiding them to a fifth-placed finish in the Portuguese Primeira Liga and Europa League qualification.

There were offers to return to England, an invite to take over the institution that is Flamengo in Brazil but, ultimately, he chose Braga, his home club. At this time, family had to come first.

Carvalhal was appointed the manager of Braga in July for the second time in his career

'What happened made a big difference in my decision,' he says. 

'Flamengo is so big, probably the best in South America, it was a huge opportunity. I had contact to come back to England too but my family has seen me move around different countries a lot. With what is going on in the world and after what happened that night with those bandits, no, I needed to be home, so the decision was to come here.'

He is sat in the dramatic surroundings of Estádio Municipal de Braga, more fondly known as The Quarry. Braga's stadium is cut into the side of Mount Castro, overlooking the city.

A confirmed Anglophile, Carvalhal follows the results of former clubs Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea closely and those of his friend Jose Mourinho at Tottenham. The two sat their UEFA pro-licence together and remain in touch. 

'You remind me I meant to call him,' he says. Indeed the records Carvalhal equalled last season at Rio Ave were set under Mourinho's father Jose Felix, also a coach.

'I called Jose after the game when Rio Ave matched the points record but we were by the sea and it was too windy. I'll call him this week.

'Jose is tremendous. I may have started coaching a year or two before him but he put the building blocks in place for every Portuguese coach to follow. Before him perhaps there was too much tradition.

'The reason you see so many Portuguese coaches in Europe, in China, South America, is because of Jose. The impact he had when he first went to Chelsea, the personality, the languages, intelligence, even the style of his clothes, he opened the doors. We all swapped ideas and everyone wanted a Portuguese coach.'

Carvalhal was perhaps unfortunate to not make a more indelible mark on English football himself.

The former Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea manager enjoyed his time in English football

He took Wednesday to the Championship play-off final in 2016 and semi final the following year, only to miss out to Hull City and Huddersfield Town. 

His style and eccentric analogies brought fun and an initial flourish to his Premier League tenure with Swansea City, including wins over Liverpool and Arsenal, but failed to save them from relegation.

'The Championship is the hardest of leagues, so competitive. A marathon run at speed. I follow the results all the time. It's upsetting to see Swansea and Wednesday fall but the play-offs are very hard. Wednesday have lost their path, they are a giant and deserve to be in the Premier League within the next two years. 

'People say it's harder because of what Sheffield United have achieved but Wednesday won't go forward by looking sideways. Losing 12 points next season makes it hard but if they re-organise with energy who knows?'

While determined to make an impact this year with his talented Braga squad, it's clear a return to England beckons.

'My personality is completely cemented in English football. I miss it, the traditions, special atmospheres, the mentality of the players. My focus is here. This is special, to be at Braga, my club, in my city. I want to leave my stamp on here and be successful but, maybe, in a year or two, I can return.'

You sense he's not a man to argue with.
