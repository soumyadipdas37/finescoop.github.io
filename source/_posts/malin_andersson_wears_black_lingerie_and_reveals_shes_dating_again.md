New chapter: It comes after Malin revealed that she's now 'looking for love' and has started 'going on dates again' after her abusive ex-boyfriend Tom Kemp was jailed earlier this month

It comes after Malin revealed that she's now 'looking for love' and has started 'going on dates again' after her abusive ex-boyfriend Tom Kemp was jailed earlier this month.  

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: 'To be fair, do you know what, I am. I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?'  

Malin, who also spoke about body positivity at the Lovehoney virtual love camp, added: 'I do want a family - I want a husband. 

'I want a good-looking little basketball player. I do like a basketball player and I want my family. I want a few kids maybe one or two I want a little dog.'  

Stunning: Malin looked effortlessly chic in jeans and a cropped white bralet as she stepped out on Friday

Justice: Malin's former boyfriend Tom Kemp, 29, was jailed for ten months earlier this month after beating her (pictured in February 2019)

Malin was last in a relationship with Tom and the couple welcomed daughter Consy in December 2019, who tragically passed away. 

The couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship, and earlier this month, Tom was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Tom, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.    

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

Malin has spoken candidly about her grief and also works as a carer, after returning to the job as she felt a 'void' while away from the sector. 

Speaking about lockdown, she told MailOnline: 'I kept myself busy - I was volunteering with the caring work, I was doing mental health lives everyday on my Instagram.' 

'Living alone was fine by me I think it gave me a good time to do a lot more work on myself so I think I benefitted from it.'

Open: Malin, who promotes body positivity on social media, also explained how she believes that edited pictures can be damaging for young people

Malin also described how it is important to be 'open and raw' with topics such as sexual empowerment. 

The TV star said: 'I think being sexually open is just as empowering as being body positive - it all kind of intertwines.' 

Speaking about how her perception of herself has altered since appearing on Love Island, she added: 'I think it has changed a lot for me because I was someone completely different back then and my main focus was on my appearance. I think it is all a journey.' 

Describing her attitude to sex, she continued: 'My attitude to it is to just be you and be yourself. 

'But say if you are in bed with your partner and you are feeling insecure and uncomfortable then you are not going to feel good and you're not going to be enjoying the experience of enjoying sex with them.

Malin also revealed how she is a 'fan of lingerie' and told how that is her 'all over' with it making her feel most empowered. 

She said: 'Knowing that I have got a nice set of underwear on and say I have a suit on, or a dress on, only I know that matching set underneath and it empowers you because I am not doing it for anyone else - I am doing it for me.'  

However the body positivity campaigner, who has 690,000 Instagram followers, told how she has 'awesome' fans.

She said: 'I have such cool followers - like I love my followers they are all awesome. You get the odd troll but I blocked out comments so they can't comment certain words I have got a filter on. 

'It is the people that know me, that know my journey, know why I am doing it - that is what I care about - I don't really care about anyone else.
