This is the moment guests at a Mexican wedding dance within a small square on the floor to maintain social distancing.

The video was filmed at a wedding in the northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon earlier this month.

Footage shows the moment several couples on the dance floor make sure to stay inside socially-distant squares marked by tape.

It comes after the local government announced they were on 'orange alert' which was downgraded from 'red alert' on September 4, allowing locals to hold celebrations such as weddings but requiring them to maintain a distance of five feet from each other.Â

The video goes on to show the rest of the venue as the just-married couple is also seen enjoying a dance, but, unlike their guests, were not confined to a box or wearing face masks.

The Mexican 'epidemiological traffic light' system was created to notify locals which state of emergency they are in depending on the number of people hospitalised due to COVID-19.

It goes from green to yellow to orange to red in order of how serious the situation is at the time.

The new status will allow citizens to have celebrations such as weddings or quinceaneras, but are required to follow the social distancing guidelines maintaining 5 feet between guests.

Venues will also be expected to keep their capacity at 30 percent or less and guests should wear their face masks all the time.

According to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University Mexico has reported 697,663 cases of the virus leading to 73,493 deaths.
