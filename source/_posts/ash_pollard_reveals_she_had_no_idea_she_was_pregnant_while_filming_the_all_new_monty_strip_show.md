Ash Pollard will welcome her first child with partner Pete Ferne in a matter of weeks. 

But the former My Kitchen Rules star had a bumpy road to realising she was expecting. 

The 34-year-old told The Daily Telegraph on Saturday that she was immensely sick while on the set of Seven's All New Monty: Guys & Gals. 

No idea: Ash Pollard (pictured) told the The Daily Telegraph on Saturday that she was immensely sick while on the set of Seven's All New Monty: Guys & Gals and had no idea that she was pregnant 

'I had no idea I was pregnant and I was so sick … just absolutely so ill during the filming of that show, I can't even tell you,' she said. 

In between rehearsals for the strip show and early starts on Sea FM, the radio host thought she was just exhausted. 

'I get up for breakfast radio every morning and was absolutely burning the candle at both ends, so I just thought it was that,' Ash said. 

Clueless: 'I had no idea I was pregnant and I was so sick … just absolutely so ill during the filming of that show, I can't even tell you,' she said. 'I get up for breakfast radio every morning and was absolutely burning the candle at both ends, so I just thought it was that' 

Congrats! Early in the rehearsal process, Ash discovered she was expecting her first child. Instead of pulling out of the show, Ash soldiered on, saying she chose to 'just work through it'

Early in the rehearsal process, Ash discovered she was expecting her first child - even though a home pregnancy test had been negative. 

She was tested by doctors for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) - and diagnosed with the disease, but a second pregnancy test was positive - she was in her first trimester. 

Instead of pulling out of the show, Ash soldiered on, saying: 'I just thought, 'whatever, this is a great experience. Whatever is happening to you now is not that debilitating, just work through it', which I did.'

Soon! Ash Pollard will welcome her first child with partner Pete Ferne in a matter of weeks

Excited: Ash announced in March that she was expecting her first child with Peter (pictured) on her HIT 101.3 breakfast show and is due to give birth in September

Ash announced in March that she was expecting her first child with Peter on her HIT 101.3 breakfast show and is due to give birth in September. 

The chef and former cooking show star has been dating the builder since 2017.  

Recently, Ash shared her dismay at COVID-19 restrictions which saw many hospitals in Melbourne temporarily ban water baths and showers for women in labour.

Posting on her Instagram story, the radio presenter explained that while she is normally a 'glass half full' person the news has made her feel 'anxious' and 'lonely'.   

 Upset: Recently, Ash shared her dismay at COVID-19 restrictions which saw many hospitals in Melbourne temporarily ban water baths and showers for women in labour

'No showers or water baths for women enduring labour at the mo due to COVID-19 restrictions in hospital. It's one blow after the other for mums to be,' she wrote. 

'I know I'll look back on this pregnancy and have the most outrageous stories to tell about growing a babe in a pandemic but for reals, it's probs the loneliest and most anxious I've ever been in my life. 

'And I'm a glass half full kinda foxy Cleopatra,' she added. 

She told fans: 'I know I'll look back on this pregnancy and have the most outrageous stories to tell about growing a babe in a pandemic but for reals, it's probs the loneliest and most anxious I've ever been in my life'
