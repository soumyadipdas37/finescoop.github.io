New Jersey authorities have charged seven teens in connection to an August break-in at an animal farm that led to a viral photo of one of the alleged teens riding a miniature donkey. 

The Wyckoff Police Department shared in a Tuesday release that the group was charged with trespassing, criminal mischief, and overloading animals. 

Charged in the group were three 17-year-old boys, three 17-year-old girls and an 18-year-old male. 

None of the suspects were named in the release.  

Wycoff police have charged seven teens in connection to the break-in at Abma's Farm on August 22. A young girl identified as a 17-year-old student-athlete at River Dell High School in Bergen County, New Jersey, was photographed riding a miniature donkey at the barnyard petting zoo

All of the cases for the minors will be handled in the Superior Court, the Daily Voice reports. 

The adult will be tried in the Municipal Court.  

The investigation was led by Detective Sgt. Michael Ragucci and Detective Sgt. Kevin Kasak.   

On August 22, Jimmy Abma, a fourth-generation farmer whose family has owned Abma’s Farm in Wyckoff, New Jersey, for more than 80 years, received the message on his phone about the group's activities. 

It showed a young girl riding on a miniature donkey.

Abma recognized the animal, which he confirmed to be his after seeing that the Snapchat image also had the caption ‘Abma’s Farm’ attached toward the bottom.

The owner of Abma's Farm, Jimmy Abma (above), received the image of the girl riding the donkey at around 10:30pm on August 22. That's when he sped toward the petting zoo and chased the teens away

Abma temporarily closed the barnyard so that veterinary staff could do a wellness check on the animals. The image above shows one of the animals being tended to by a veterinarian

He also grew concerned since the miniature donkeys on his property are not big enough to support the weight of a teenager.

‘Obviously, we’re closed, so that raised a concern to me right off the bat, that there’s people trespassing, the animals are somewhat in danger and I just need to figure out what’s going on,’ he told WCBS-TV.

Abma, who lives on the property, said he immediately ran outside and chased at least half a dozen youngsters off of his property, which includes a barnyard petting zoo, a farm, and a supermarket.

He was shocked to discover that the gates to the petting zoo were open and some of the animals had been traumatized.

One pony had lipstick spread on its face.

Abma said that all of the animals have been accounted for

Abma said several of the animals were left traumatized by the experience

‘Couple of the animals you couldn’t even get close to,’ Abma said. 'They were all skittish. They were all jumping around.

‘We did a full count on the animals and we’re still trying to account for all of them so it’s just a frustrating thing.’

He added: ‘These animals, they have the ability to kick and rear up and they have the ability to bite you.’

Abma also said he noticed two teens trying to shoplift items from his supermarket.

As he dialed 911, the two teenagers ran off. 

On Facebook, Abma wrote that all of the animals were accounted for and that the barnyard would be closed to allow a veterinarian to come to the property to conduct a wellness check.

Abma posted an image on Facebook the following Monday showing a veterinarian checking up on one of the donkeys.
