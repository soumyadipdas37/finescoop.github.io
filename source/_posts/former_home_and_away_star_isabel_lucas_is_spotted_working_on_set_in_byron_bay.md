Former Home and Away star Isabel Lucas was spotted working on the set of her new project in Byron Bay on Wednesday.

The actress, 35, flaunted her slim physique in tiny black shorts and a pink T-shirt as she filmed scenes with her former boyfriend Chris Hemsworth's brother Luke on the beach.

The brunette beauty wore a neutral palette of makeup and styled her short hair in  curls as she soaked up the sun while working on the shore.

At one point, Isabel was also spotted taking photographs of her co-star on the sand while the production crew filmed them.

After filming the scene, the actress put on a warm green jacket and enjoyed a walk along the footpath.

On Saturday, Isabel went to great lengths to stay anonymous during a Zoom call with COVID-19 conspiracy theorists and lockdown critics, by covering her face with a black hoodie and mask and using the alias 'X'.

The anti-vaxxer told her co-panellists that she needed 'to be careful about being outspoken' because she was a famous Australian film and television actress.

'I'm here and I don't want to be anonymous, but I am about to start filming a film and I do need to be careful about being outspoken because you can get dropped from charities, you can lose campaigns with car companies,' the 35-year-old said. 

'It has happened to me in recent times for speaking out. I feel careful and I don't want to elicit any aggressive, threatening responses.  

The actress has signed on to feature in The Ogilvy Fortune, just months after she was dropped as an ambassador for Plan International Australia, a charity for girls' equality following her controversial comments about vaccinations.

Lucas said she felt '100 per cent called to shine a light on the reality of what's really going on' in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown directives. 

'There's a certain level of agenda and darkness that has had authority ... and that has had a lot of people believing lies,' she said in the Zoom chat with other well-known figures in the anti-lockdown and anti-mask community.

The actress also claimed thst she met several doctors while living in California who dropped out of the medical field due to 'corruption'.

'All of what they were speaking about is what we're facing right now. When we are in a fear state, we just follow what we're told.

Lucas said that at the beginning of the pandemic in March she was asked by her local council to film a video calling on locals to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus.

She appeared in the clip urging viewers to avoid travelling in NSW to slow the spread of coronavirus, saying: 'This is not the right time to be visiting Byron or other coastal towns, it's a good chance to give nature a break and ourselves.' 

Lucas also revealed she regretted appearing in the clip during the Zoom chat.

'I saw that there was all these other great people doing it and it's that sort of thing where you can get looped in without realising you're being looped in,' she said.

'But those with a strong conscience and strong integrity won't as easily sell out.'
