She was one of many presenters at the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards on Wednesday evening in Nashville, Tennessee.

And Lauren Alaina stunned in a royal blue gown as she posed for photos on the award show's socially-distanced red carpet.   

The 25-year-old country songstress' unique gown included an oversized ruffled feature across the one-shoulder neckline.

Alaina had her thick blonde hair tied up into a chic top knot and she had a pair of silver drop earrings fastened to her ears.

The One Beer singer allowed her dress to pull focus by rocking a conservative amount of understated jewelry, which included a wrist cuff and a single ring. 

Lauren highlighted her naturally beauty features by sporting a generous amount of bronzing powder, a soft brown eyeshadow look on her eyes, and a glossy nude lip. 

She posed with one hand on her hip and the other at her side in order to show off her bright white manicure.

With an envelope in hand, Lauren took to the stage half-way through the show to present the Male of the Year award.

She could not help but beam as she looked straight into the camera and gushed over the male artists nominated.

Nominees included Dierks Bentley, Luke Combs, Thomas Rhett, Chris Stapleton, and the evening's gracious host Keith Urban.

Luke Combs ended up taking home the highly-coveted award and he delivered a passionate speech dedicated to his family, friends, and fans.

Earlier this month, Lauren released her highly-anticipated EP titled Getting Over Him, a collection of break up song based on her personal experience with heartbreak over the past two-years. 

The biggest names in country music maintained their social-distance for The 55th Academy of Country Music Awards on Wednesday in Nashville, Tennessee.

Keith Urban hosted the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards, which aired on CBS.

The annual award show is typically held in April in Las Vegas, but was delayed this year and moved to Nashville, Tennessee due to the pandemic.

The performances, some of which are pre-taped, span three historically important stages in country music history, but none were open to fans.

The smallest, the Bluebird Cafe, accommodates only about 90 people pre-pandemic and the venue helped to start the careers of Garth Brooks and Taylor Swift, among many others. Miranda Lambert sang the aptly titled Bluebird from the small stage, with other performances from Tim McGraw, Jimmie Allen and Luke Combs. 

The Ryman Auditorium, an early landmark for gospel and bluegrass as well as country, featured performances by Maren Morris, Thomas Rhett with Jon Pardi and Kelsea Ballerini.

Taylor Swift performed at the biggest of the venues, the Grand Ole Opry House, which acted as the center of operations for the live broadcast.
