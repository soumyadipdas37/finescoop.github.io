Victoria's health department will undertake contact tracing to investigate the extent of two new coronavirus outbreaks at Woolworths. 

The positive cases were reported on Tuesday and Wednesday and have been linked to supermarkets at Altona North, north-west of the CBD, and Glen Waverley, east of Melbourne.

Woolworths said it has 'high standards of cleaning and hygiene in place' in a statement following the outbreaks.

The retailer confirmed an employee who last worked at the Altona North store on September 4 tested positive to COVID-19 and is self-isolating.

'We're making contact with our team members and providing our full support to those required to self-isolate in line with advice from the health authorities,' the supermarket giant said in a statement.

It also urged customers who shopped in North Altona on Friday 4 September to contact health authorities if they feel unwell within the next two weeks. 

Woolworths told Daily Mail Australia it became aware of the Glen Waverley outbreak on Tuesday after an infected staff member worked between 8pm and 1am on September 6. 

'Team members at the store are undertaking precautionary testing and awaiting COVID-19 test results before returning to work,' a Woolworths spokesperson said.

The spokesperson also said Woolworths would normally use staff members from nearby stores to cover the shifts of the employees in isolation.

The retailer has not been able to move employees across multiple sites due to Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown (Pictured: a man rides his bike in Melbourne during lockdown)

But under Melbourne's strict Stage 4 restrictions, the retailer has not been able to move employees across multiple sites and the store is closed until further notice.

'Our Chief Medical Officer is working on this matter closely with the Department of Health and Human Services and we hope to recommence trade for our customers as soon as possible,' the statement read. 

Two more team members tested positive to the virus at the Glen Waverley store in August.

It has been deep cleaned and will reopen after staff members receive their test results.
