April Love Geary is reportedly pregnant with her third child.

And the model is already basking in the glow of motherhood, as she enjoys some quality time with her kids.

She played in the sand Monday with one-year-old daughter Lola Alain, as she took to her Instagram Story with some photos of their mother/daughter day at the beach in Malibu.

The 25-year-old let the toddler crawl around in the sand, as she played with a small stick she found.

Not pictured during their outing was older daughter Mia Love, two, whom she also shares with fiancé Robin Thicke, 43.

A source confirmed earlier this month to Us Weekly that she and the Blurred Lines artist are pregnant with their third child.

She previously joked about getting pregnant again, posting a sexy black-and-white photo of Thicke to her Insta Story back in May, writing: 'GET ME PREGNANT AGAIN. jk don't but like omg.' 

Glowing glam: April certainly looked glowing, as she posted a gorgeous fresh-faced selfie to her Story after her beach outing

April certainly looked glowing, as she posted a gorgeous fresh-faced selfie to her Story after her beach outing.

But she won't stand for body-shaming during her pregnancy, as she clapped back at trolls last month in a video on her story.

The California girl told her 174k followers: 'Just letting you know that I’m not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was so much more attractive when I was skinnier because before having babies I didn’t have this fat a**. I am forever grateful for this baby weight.'

She posted some more videos of her kids Monday, as Lola played with a flute, while climbing into her lap, before playing on a scooter.

Robin also shares son Julian Fuego, 10, with ex-wife Paula Patton, 44, to whom he was married from 2005 to 2015.
