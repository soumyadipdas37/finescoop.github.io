Paris Hilton has revealed she was involved in 'multiple' abusive relationships, where she was strangled and struck by her exes.

'I went through multiple abusive relationships,' Paris told People. 'I was strangled, I was hit, I was grabbed aggressively. I put up with things no one should.'

Paris, 39, believes she was set up for a future of abusive relationships while attending the Provo Canyon boarding school as a teenager.

Paris claims she endured emotional abuse at the hands of the school during the 11 months she attended, which was intended to focus on her mental and behavioral development.

The socialite alleges she was physically abused and berated by the boarding school.

Eventually, Paris began to normalize the behavior.

'I had become so used to [abusive behavior] at Provo, that it made me feel like it was normal,' she continued.

Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.

'They all seemed like such nice guys and then the true colors would show,' Paris explained. 'They'd get jealous, or defensive or try to control me. And there there would come a point where they would become physically, verbally and emotionally abusive.'

Paris initially interpreted the 'crazy' behavior as an indicator of just how much they loved her.

'Looking back, I can't believe I let people treat me like that,' she said.

In 2003, Paris landed at the center of a scandal after her infamous sex tape was leaked to the public.

But Paris believes the tape never would have happened had she not attended Provo.

'I would never have let anyone into my life like [the man in the tape, whom she was dating at the time]. I met the worst person I could meet and if I hadn't gone to Provo, I wouldn't have entertained the thought of letting him into my life. Provo affected my future relationships.'

Nowadays, Paris is in a 'safe' and healthy relationship with entrepreneur Carter Reum, whom she has been dating for nine months.

'I feel so safe with him,' she told the magazine. 'Before, I don't think I was really ready for a good relationship. But I've learned so much. And I'm so grateful to have found my perfect match.'

Paris shares her painful past in the upcoming documentary This Is Paris, which premieres September 14 on her YouTube channel.

In it, she details the abuse she allegedly endured at Provo.

'From the moment I woke up until I went to bed, it was all day screaming in my face, yelling at me, continuous torture,' she previously told People.

The House of Wax actress continued: 'The staff would say terrible things. They were constantly making me feel bad about myself and bully me. I think it was their goal to break us down.

'And they were physically abusive, hitting and strangling us. They wanted to instill fear in the kids so we’d be too scared to disobey them.'

Hilton said she was subsequently placed in solitary confinement as punishment: 'They would use that as punishment, sometimes 20 hours a day.'

Reached for comment by People regarding Paris' accusations, the school said it went under new ownership after the heiress left the institution.

'We therefore cannot comment on the operations or patient experience prior to this time,' the school said.
