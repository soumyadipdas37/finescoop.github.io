As autumn creeps closer, the evenings are starting to get chillier - but you don't have to let that cut your outdoor entertaining short. 

If you want to make the most of your garden before winter arrives then investing in a patio heater is a great way to ensure you're kept cosy and comfortable. 

Quick to heat up and cost-effective to run, the Oypla Electrical 2KW Quartz Free Standing Outdoor Electric Garden Patio Heater is a popular buy among Amazon shoppers. 

The Oypla Free Standing Outdoor Electric Garden Patio Heater is a steal at only £51.99

Shoppers are calling it 'absolutely brilliant' and 'perfect for cool evenings'. At just £51.99, it's surprisingly affordable too. 

While gas heaters and fire pits are a great choice for heating up your garden, when it comes to the simplest, most efficient option, an electric heater can't be beaten. 

The Oypla Electric Patio Heater is easy to turn off and on, quick to heat up and energy efficient, making it ideal for outdoor entertaining.   

It's free-standing which means it can be placed on the floor and moved around as opposed to mounted on a wall. Often seen in outdoor restaurants, this style is particularly popular as it's generally more sturdy and can be moved to accommodate your seating arrangements.

The subtle design is a lot less obtrusive than some other models we've found and is sure to blend into any outdoor space. That being said, Amazon reviewers have noted that it's best for heating smaller spaces so if you have a large garden or yard, you might want to look into convection heaters. 

The Oypla Free Standing Patio Heater heats your garden with minimal fuss, allowing you to move it around and adjust the height 

'This is perfect for evenings you want to stay out a little longer,' one shopper wrote in their review. 'Me and the other half were lovey and warm underneath it. It's not going to fill a gazebo with heat because of the size of it but it's perfect for us.' 

Another commented: 'Wow.. excellent purchase and cannot believe the price! Really sturdy, well built and good looking. Has 3 settings with the 3 bars.... you need an extension lead but that is all. Great product and unbelievable for the price.' 

The Oypla Patio Heater has three heat settings which means you can crank up the heat as it gets colder. The adjustable height is another top feature as it can be adjusted to suit all outdoor spaces.   

A third reviewer wrote: 'Very good and takes the chill off. A really nice item. Great for our outdoor furniture and warms the immediate are well.'
