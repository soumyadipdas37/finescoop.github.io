She has long been known for her long blonde bouncy tresses.  

But on Wednesday, Roxy Jacenko shocked her fans when she dramatically cut her hair very short.  

The 40-year-old, who is married to former investment banker Oliver Curtis, lopped her locks off for a shorter, chicer alternative - a blunt cut bob.

Who is that girl? PR queen Roxy Jacenko shocked her fans on Tuesday by dramatically cutting her hair into a bob 

She uploaded a video of herself undergoing the major transformation while sitting in the chair of celebrity hairdresser and hair stylist, Travis Balcke.

Roxy was captured concentrating on keeping her head still as Travis chopped, chatted and added the finishing touches to her new 'do. 

'It was time,' she captioned her Instagram post. 

It is not the first time the blonde beauty has looked dramatically different.

The mother of two sported a noticeably smoother visage and a plumper looking pout earlier this month, in a promotional photo for her online marketing classes.

'Eeeeekkk - my NEW course is now complete!!!' she captioned the post.

She has also been very vocal when it comes to cosmetically enhancing her appearance over the years.

Roxy has undergone a rhinoplasty, tweaked her bust with a breast augmentation and had botox and filler.

The businesswoman looks noticeably different to her former self.

Roxy shocked fans on Instagram in April when she uploaded multiple pictures of herself in her younger years as part of the #bloomchallenge - a viral challenge to promote Stan Original Series Bloom. 

Her lips appeared thinner, her nose was not as tapered and her hair was dark.

She said in June 2018: 'If you're not happy with something about yourself, what's wrong with changing it? 

'I like to be real. There's nothing worse than when you read articles about people refuting claims that they've fixed this or fixed that.'
