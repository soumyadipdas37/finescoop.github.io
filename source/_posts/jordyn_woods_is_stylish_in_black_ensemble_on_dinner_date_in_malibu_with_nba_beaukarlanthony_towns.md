She just went Instagram official with new boyfriend Karl-Anthony Towns.

And on Wednesday night, Jordyn Woods, 23, and the Minnesota Timberwolves player, 24, were snapped heading to dinner at celebrity hotspot Nobu in Malibu.  

The two arrived in a luxury SUV and wore black cloth face masks as they exited the vehicle and headed into the restaurant.

Jordyn's reveal of her new man on Sunday came more than a year after she was kicked out of the Kardashian–Jenner circle after Khloé Kardashian's then-partner Tristan Thompson kissed her at a party.

She was formerly one of star Kylie Jenner's best friends, and the two often seemed inseparable, but the friendship was severed after the brief tryst came to light. 

Since then, Jordyn has made sure to keep herself in the spotlight and maintains a vibrant presence on social media.

For her night out Wednesday, she paired a black sweater worn off the shoulder with wide-legged black leather pants and a pair of black heels.

Jordyn recently opened up to the evangelical Christian Hillsong Channel about how she felt after the Tristan cheating scandal broke last year.

'I remember just sitting in a very dark place. I had my family to talk to, I had you to talk to, but I just felt like I had no one,' she told host Natalie Manuel Lee.

'You take everything you think you know for a whole decade, the people you think you know, the life you think you know, everything that you've grown up doing and take it all away from someone. I didn't even know how to feel,' Jordyn admitted.

Jordyn faced backlash after it emerged she had shared a kiss with Tristan at a party when he was still dating Khloe, whom he shares daughter True with.

The scandal meant the end of Jordyn's years-long friendship with the Kardashian family, and drove a wedge between herself and BFF Kylie.

Despite years of history, their friendship would not survive.

Cast out: 'I remember just sitting in a very dark place. I had my family to talk to, I had you to talk to, but I just felt like I had no one,' she told host Natalie Manuel Lee 

'Things happen and that's what makes us human. But just acceptance and accountability and responsibility,' she ecplained. 'I feel like people in this generation lack accountability and when you can't accept what you've done or you can't accept that, then you can't heal from it.' 

She went on: 'It's easy to beat yourself up over things that you could have done differently. You can't hold on to what you could have or should have done, you just have to accept what actually happened and then you can let it go. It might take you a month to let it go, it might take you a year to let it go but you have to start praying to be able to let it go.' 

While Jordyn at least had her family and faith to get her through the trouble, that didn't stop her from feeling completely alone. 

'It's easy to make it seem like the world is against you and in that case in that moment, I did feel like everything was against me,' she said. 'The only thing I really had to lean on was my faith and my family. At some point in time, you're going to go through something that feels like your world is falling apart.' 

Jordyn continued: 'The amount of strength I've gained in this year alone, nothing else could have shaped me to the person I am today..... I'm not happy that people were hurt and people had to go through what they went through.... but I'm happy that I was able to become who I am today.'  

Lessons learned: 'It's easy to beat yourself up over things that you could have done differently. You can't hold on to what you could have or should have done, you just have to accept what actually happened and then you can let it go,' she said
