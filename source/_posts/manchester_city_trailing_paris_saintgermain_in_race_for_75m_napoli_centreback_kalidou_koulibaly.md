Paris Saint-Germain have moved ahead of Manchester City in the race to sign Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, according to reports.

The French champions are keen to make the 29-year-old centre-back their key defensive signing of the summer in a deal worth £75million, The Telegraph has said.

Senegal captain Koulibaly has impressed with his commanding performances for Napoli, whose coach, Gennaro Gattuso, has admitted he could leave.

Speaking to Sky Sport, Gattuso said: 'I have no doubts he is one of the strongest champions in the world in his role.

'He has always given me great availability and always trains well. I would be sorry to lose him, both for the man and for the player.

"But you know that numbers are important for clubs and at this moment something needs to be done for numbers. But I'd be happy to keep him."

City boss Pep Guardiola has turned his attention to French Under 21 international Jules Kounde, who has a £68.25million buyout clause at the Liga side.

Man City have had a bid rejected for Sevilla star Jules Kounde and could miss out on Koulibaly

Sevilla sporting director Monchi revealed that the UEFA Super Cup hopefuls have rejected a recent bid for the 21-year-old from City.

Speaking ahead of the clash with Bayern Munich in Budapest, Monchi said: 'I doubt that Kounde has an agreement with Man City because he has a contract with us.

'It's true, in the last days we received an offer from a club to sign Kounde. He heard about it and we rejected it.

'If they make another offer, we will listen to them again and we will answer. But only we can choose when we will answer them.

'I know Kounde pretty well and I'm sure he is focused on how he will defend against [Robert] Lewandowski, [Leroy] Sane, [Serge] Gnabry or [Thomas] Muller.'
