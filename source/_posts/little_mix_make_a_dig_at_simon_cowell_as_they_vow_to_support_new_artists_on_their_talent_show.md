The stars of Little Mix took wipe at Simon Cowell, as they suggested that weren't as supported as much as they would've liked after appearing on The X Factor.

Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards shot to fame after winning the ITV talent show, fronted by Simon, back in 2011.

And as they prepare for the Saturday launch of their BBC talent show The Search, the stars have shared how they'll be handling things different when it comes to artists.

'The after care is essential – that’s the difference between wanting to get on the stage again,' Jade is quoted by The Mirror as saying. Whether they get through or not, our team call them up for a while to see how they’re doing.

'We’ll support everyone because we’ve been through a similar experience and probably could have benefited from a bit more support along the way.'

Sharing the lessons she would have liked to have learned when starting out, Jesy said: 'Don’t get too ahead of yourself, stay focused, work hard – and try and stay friends! Just try to enjoy it and have fun, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Simon Cowell for comment. 

Ahead of the talent show's debut, Little Mix decided to recreate some of the BBC's most iconic moments over the years. 

Perrie, Jesy, Jade and Leigh-Anne were tasked with performing scenes from EastEnders, Gavin and Stacey, Line of Duty and even Absolutely Fabulous.

In a hilarious video shared to the group's official Little Mix: The Search Twitter account, the band started off by recreating Kat Slater's infamous 'you ain't my mother' scene.

The foursome started by saying: 'Hey we're Little Mix and these are iconic TV moments.' 

It then showed the foursome rehearsing lines before launching into a dramatic performance of EastEnders.  

The iconic 2001 scene saw feisty character Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) reveal that she was, in fact, sister Zoe's (Michelle Ryan) mother, and it has been named the greatest soap storyline of all time.

Jade, 27, took on the role of Zoe as she said: 'You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mother!'

While Jesy, 29, also played the same character as she delivered the same dramatic line in a different clip.

Meanwhile Leigh-Anne, 28, and Perrie, 27,  wore leopard print coats to mimic Kat as they delivered her explosive line in separate videos: 'Yes I am.'

Elsewhere, the group recreated Smithy's (James Corden) takeaway order on Gavin and Stacey where he asks for a chicken bhuna, lamb bhuna, prawn bhuna, mushroom rice, bag of chips, keema naan and nine poppadoms. 

Little Mix also recreated a AC-12, Anti-Corruption Unit 12, interview from Line Of Duty yet they struggled to all deliver the line at the same time.

Drag Race superfan Jade also got to impersonate RuPaul as she recreated a scene from RuPaul's Drag Race UK, where she served as a guest judge. 

In the funny video, Perrie and Jesy had to go head-to-head in a lip sync battle, singing Shout Out to My Ex, and judged by Jade.

The group also replicated a scene from Strictly Come Dancing where Katya Jones and Ed Balls' routine is judged by the panel.

Little Mix ended the video with a hilarious narration of a David Attenborough documentary.

It comes after Jade revealed she 'went off in a huff a couple of times' after disagreeing with her bandmates while filming their new show Little Mix: The Search.

The singer said things did get tense between herself, Perrie, Leigh-Anne and Jesy, at times as they searched for a band to join them on tour.

With all four girls having strong opinions and acting as mentors, Leigh-Anne, 28, admitted they 'all have different tastes in music, so we were bound to disagree'.

While Jesy said she wasn't surprised they 'didn't see eye to eye', Jade told New! Magazine: 'Maybe I went off in a huff a couple of times'. 

The show kicks off this Saturday on the BBC and was originally thought as a rival for the X Factor, however music mogul Simon has decided to rest the show this year.

During the interview, Jade also took a swipe at the ITV show which she rose to fame on, saying she believes the dwindling ratings over the years is because it has 'lost it's authenticity'.

She said: 'I think the problem is when it's like a script. When they're like, "This is going to be a sob story", then they'll stop the song halfway through and ask if they have something else.

'We got so used to seeing that, it lost its authenticity. The minute it doesn't seem real, you switch off.'

Jade said she could 'literally write it myself and tell you what's coming next', because the format is tired and predictable.

Little Mix, who switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018, were originally formed on The X Factor in 2011. 

In 2018, Simon insisted he 'never fell out' with the group and that tensions between himself and Little Mix's management, Modest Management, led to an 'embarrassing row' over a songwriting credit for their new track Woman Like Me.

The music mogul even branded the girls 'the hardest working bunch' he has ever worked with.

Simon again dismissed rumours of a feud with his former protégés Little Mix in 2019 after it was revealed they had brought the release of their rival talent series The Search forward from 2021 to 2020. It will be airing this autumn.

Little Mix: The Search kicks off on Saturday at 7pm on BBC One.
