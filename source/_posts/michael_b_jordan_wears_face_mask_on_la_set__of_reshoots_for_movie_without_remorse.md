He stars in the action thriller Without Remorse based on the Tom Clancy best-seller.

And as Hollywood cautiously restarts production in the era of COVID-19, Michael B. Jordan was seen back on set filming re-shoots for the movie in LA on Thursday.

The actor. 33, wore a face mask as he made his way from his trailer to the set as productions abide by strict regulations designed to protect staff and crew from the coronavirus.

In the film, Jordan stars as John Clark, a Navy SEAL who sets out to avenge his wife's murder only to find himself inside of a larger conspiracy.

Directed by Sicario: Day of the Soldado filmmaker Stefano Sollima, Without Remorse was originally slated for a theatrical release through Paramount Pictures.

However, with many movie theatres shuttered due to the pandemic, producer New Republic ended up selling the distribution rights to Amazon, as Variety reported earlier this week.

Earlier this month, Jordan had joined his Black Panther co-stars Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke at an intimate memorial service in Malibu for Chadwick Boseman.

Boseman died on August 28 from colon cancer at the age of 43 after a four-year battle with the disease.

He had kept his diagnosis private, seeking treatment as he pursued his acting career.  

Jordan played Erik Killmonger alongside Boseman's King T'challa in the 2018 superhero blockbuster.

'I’ve been trying to find the words, but nothing comes close to how I feel,' Jordan wrote on Instagram a few days after Jordan's passing.

'I’ve been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug…everything. I wish we had more time,' he said.

The Fruitvale Station and Creed star addressed Boseman directly in his post, writing: 'One of the last times we spoke, you said we were forever linked, and now the truth of that means more to me than ever.' 

He then pledged: 'I’m dedicating the rest of my days to live the way you did. With grace, courage, and no regrets. “Is this your king!?” Yes . he . is! Rest In Power Brother.'

Boseman and Jordan's Marvel Studios hit Black Panther earned a whopping $700 million at the domestic box office, the highest-grossing domestic movie in 2018, and $1.3 billion worldwide.

 I’ve been trying to find the words, but nothing comes close to how I feel. I’ve been reflecting on every moment, every conversation, every laugh, every disagreement, every hug…everything. I wish we had more time. One of the last times we spoke, you said we were forever linked , and now the truth of that means more to me than ever. Since nearly the beginning of my career, starting with All My Children when I was 16 years old you paved the way for me. You showed me how to be better, honor purpose, and create legacy. And whether you’ve known it or not…I’ve been watching, learning and constantly motivated by your greatness. I wish we had more time. Everything you’ve given the world … the legends and heroes that you’ve shown us we are … will live on forever. But the thing that hurts the most is that I now understand how much of a legend and hero YOU are. Through it all, you never lost sight of what you loved most. You cared about your family , your friends, your craft, your spirit. You cared about the kids, the community, our culture and humanity. You cared about me. You are my big brother, but I never fully got a chance to tell you, or to truly give you your flowers while you were here. I wish we had more time. I'm more aware now than ever that time is short with people we love and admire. I’m gonna miss your honesty, your generosity, your sense of humor, and incredible gifts. I’ll miss the gift of sharing space with you in scenes. I’m dedicating the rest of my days to live the way you did. With grace, courage, and no regrets. “Is this your king!?” Yes . he . is!  Rest In Power Brother.
