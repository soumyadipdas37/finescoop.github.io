Farrah Abraham rose to fame in front of the camera, but now it seems as if the former Teen Mom star is looking to reverse the roles.   

On Friday she was seen in full cap and gown as she celebrated her graduation from LA Film School, where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Entertainment Business.

The 29-year-old, who graduated magna cum laude, was seen with her 11-year-old daughter Sophia at Spago in Beverly Hills, where they celebrated her success.

She completed the look with a pair of black and white leopard heels adorned with a big bow as she beamed with pride in her graduation cap.

Showing off her accomplishment, Farrah carried a gold box fashioned in the shape of a cap that held a sea of red and white roses accented with white orchids. 

She made sure to protect herself in public as she donned a festive black lace face mask while strutting to the restaurant.

Walking beside her was daughter Sophia who twinned with her mom in the white jumpsuit, and even rocked a matching graduation cap to share in her mother's accomplishment. 

Taking to social media with a slew of content, Farrah was very vocal about what her newfound honor meant to her as she reflected on her life. 

'I received a degree in what I'm famous for today, as I know and action the very foot steps of change for equality for woman in entertainment daily, with inclusion and diversity since I first sent in my casting tape for 16&Pregnant on MTV in 2008' she wrote.

Congrats: Farrah reposted some of the messages she had received from fans congratulating her on her special day. 

Continuing on she exclaimed 'I've won for society, I've won for other teen moms, for all others in production and talent,I'm with the next generation, the generation who does not believe in allowing gaps, respects and helps every life, child, teen, mother in front of camera and behind.' 

She continued to share tribute photos and celebratory messages she received from fans on her Instagram story as she basked in the bliss of her new degree saying she was 'on to the masters & PHD.'

The OG Teen Mom though seemingly on the up, has received a lot of flack for her choices as a mother. 

She is constantly a target for trolls due to some of her questionable behavior as she is known to be very open with her young daughter about her provocative lifestyle.

She has notoriously gotten body enhancing procedures in front of her daughter and even posted a TikTok video which featured a boxed up sex toy within close proximity to her 11-year-old.   

Farrah has dabbled in the adult entertainment industry and also made the choice to talk to her young daughter about her leaked sex tape. Speaking to Logan Paul on his podcast Impaulsive she justified her behavior.

'We've talked about it and it's handled. It's part of my life. But I think that's just like part of birds-bees conversations and your actions when you get older' she said. 

Farrah, who is sometimes candid to a fault with her daughter, has a podcast with young Sophia where they talk about life and their relationship called the Abraham Gals.
