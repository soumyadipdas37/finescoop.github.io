Bruno Fernandes has been crowned Manchester United Player of the Year, despite only playing half of the season for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.

The Portugal international has been sensational since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in a £68m switch in January, scoring 12 goals and providing eight assists in 22 outings for the Red Devils. 

Fernandes' influence saw Solskjaer's side climb the Premier League table, finishing in third last season, while the Old Trafford side made the Europa League semi finals in Germany.

And Fernandes' performances have been recognised by United fans, who have voted for the 25-year-old to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, pipping Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford to the top prize. 

'Of course you want to win some trophies for the team, for the club and for the fans. But, obviously, I'm happy with the individual trophies,' Fernandes told the club's official website.

'I know you can say: "Oh, I don't care" and everything, but it's always important for a player. You always feel good when you win these kinds of awards, and I am no different.

'I am really happy. I want to add this to so many trophies for the club and for the fans because I think they deserve [it].'

Fernandes scooped 35.5 per cent of the fan vote, which was just better than the 34 per cent garnered by Martial. England international Rashford got 10.4 per cent of the vote. 

The playmaker also won the club's Player of the Month award in February, March, June and August, with Mason Greenwood winning the award in July to end Fernandes' dominance.

United full back Luke Shaw won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for the 2018-19 campaign.
