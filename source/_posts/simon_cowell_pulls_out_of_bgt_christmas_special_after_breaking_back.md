Simon Cowell has reportedly been forced to pull out of Britain's Got Talent's Christmas Special, as he continues to recover from his broken back.

Sources claim the music mogul, 60, is unable to travel to the UK from his home in Los Angeles to film the special in October, after breaking his back in an electric bike accident last month. 

Despite this setback, Simon is reportedly still raking in the cash through his television and music empire, with sources claiming he's earned an eye-watering £37million in just one year.

Sad news: Simon Cowell has reportedly been forced to pull out of Britain's Got Talent's Christmas Special, as he continues to recover from his broken back 

A source told The Sun that Diversity's Ashley Banjo is expected to fill in for Simon during non-competitive festive special, which will see BGT's biggest stars take to the stage to entertain viewers.

They said: 'Simon hoped he'd be well enough to fly from Los Angeles to the UK for the special show but he's had to pull out.

'Plus the new lockdown measures — and him having to fly two weeks before the show so he could quarantine in advance — made it even more difficult for him to make the journey.

'Simon will of course be across the show and what happens on it but this is a massive blow for him as he adores.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Simon Cowell for comment. 

Cashing in: It comes amid claims that Simon has raked in an eye-watering £37million ($46million) in just one year through his TV and music empire 

It comes amid claims that Simon has raked in an eye-watering £37million ($46million) in just one year.

The media mogul's company Simco, which oversees his earnings from TV, has reported a profit of £35million – an increase of £10million on the previous financial year, according to The Sun.

His TV empire includes such ratings juggernauts as Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor, which have also enjoyed success in international formats.

And while the global versions of his shows have brought him much success, The Sun reports that his biggest earnings come from the British arm of the TV favourites.

The shows in the UK market reportedly pull in 42 per cent of his earnings, compared to 33 per cent in the US and 21 per cent in the rest of the world.

On the mend: Meanwhile, Heidi Klum has divulged that the music mogul is keen to make an appearance during the America's Got Talent finale, which will take place on Wednesday

Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Simon is still expected to return for the America's Got Talent finale, six weeks after he broke his back in a horrific electric bike accident. 

Hedi Klum, 47, divulged that the music mogul is keen to make an appearance during the finale, which will take place in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 

The judge said that the talent show mastermind planned to come back before the season's end, but insisted his return was being kept a secret.

Heidi revealed to The Mirror: 'He is going to come to the finale, but do not tell anyone.'

Their co-star Howie Mandel also has an inkling that Simon will return to the show, but it is unclear if they expect his return to be via video link or in the flesh.

Howie added: 'I would not count out seeing Simon again before this season's end.'

Simon reportedly came within 'one-centimetre of being paralysed' when he fell from his electric bicycle and broke his back in multiple places.

The entertainment mogul was rushed to hospital at the beginning of August when he fell from his new vehicle whilst taking it for a test drive at his house in Malibu. 

He was at home with his partner Lauren Silverman, 43, their son, Eric, six, and his stepson Adam, 14, at the time of the incident.                              

Speaking just days after the accident, a family friend told MailOnline that the father-of-one was 'doing well', but was in 'shock and massive amounts of pain'. 

They said: 'He's in recovery and asleep. Lauren went with him to the hospital and has been allowed in briefly to see him. He's doing OK in the circumstances.

'He was in shock and in massive amounts of pain. He was outside in the courtyard in Malibu with Eric and Adam trying this new bike'  

They added: 'Simon's had to have a big surgery, he's got a number of breaks and has had to have a metal rod put into his back.'

'When he fell off the bike he landed right on his back which broke in a number of places. It was six hour surgery overnight on Saturday.'
