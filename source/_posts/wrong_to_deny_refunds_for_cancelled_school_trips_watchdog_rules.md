Parents who have been denied refunds for cancelled school trips should get their money back, says the competition watchdog.

In June, Money Mail revealed how one junior rugby team from Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was battling for a £30,000 refund after its trip to Orlando, in Florida, U.S., was cancelled.

Under consumer law, holidaymakers should be refunded within 14 days for cancelled package holidays. 

But many firms have refused to pay back groups, as they are not individuals.

However, the Competition and Markets Authority has now told travel firms: 'Consumers will generally be entitled to a refund when they have paid in advance for services or goods that cannot be provided because of legal restrictions as a result of the pandemic.'
