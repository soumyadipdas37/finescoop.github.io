Everton have now officially confirmed the signing of James Rodriguez, with the Colombian star become Carlo Ancelotti's marquee signing of the summer.

Toffees boss Ancelotti has finally pulled off the coup, knowing James well from his time in charge at Real Madrid.

The 29-year-old is understood to have cost Everton in the region of £20million, and has now finally brought his torrid time at Real Madrid to an end.

The Colombian has finally brought his Real Madrid nightmare to an end and moved to England 

Everton thrilled their fanbase on Monday evening by teasing the arrival, before publishing a video in which James could be heard saying: 'I'm here, I'm happy, I'm proud to be a Blue.' 

The Toffees then reeled off all of the 29-year-old's honours during his career so far, along with the teams he has played for, before showing a mocked up graphic of James in the Everton shirt.
