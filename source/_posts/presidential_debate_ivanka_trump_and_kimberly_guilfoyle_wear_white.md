Ivanka Trump cut a stylish figure in a cream pantsuit on Tuesday evening while showing support for her father at his first presidential debate against Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. 

The 38-year-old White House senior adviser joined President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on Air Force One as they traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, ahead of the highly-anticipated event. 

Ivanka looked pristine in a $3,210 cream blazer with a wrap belt by Gabriela Hearst and matching dress pants as she stepped off the aircraft at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. 

Outfit of the day: Ivanka Trump, 38, wore $3,210 cream blazer with a wrap belt by Gabriela Hearst and matching dress pants to the first presidential debate on Tuesday 

Traveling in style: The White House senior adviser was seen stepping off of Air Force Once carrying a $4,700 Chanel bag 

She carried a $4,700 quilted white leather Chanel bag as she walked across the tarmac, her straight blonde hair blowing in the breeze, revealing her pearl drop earrings.  

The former businesswoman stuck with her go-to beauty look, opting for smokey eye makeup and dusty rose lipstick.   

Ivanka had her game face on and appeared to be focused on the upcoming debate, which is the first of three head of the election on November 3.    

Earlier in the day, she was seen leaving her Washington, D.C. home in a Secret Service SUV straight from her garage.  

Say cheese! Tiffany Trump, 26, and her sister-in-law Lara, 37, took a selfie before traveling to Cleveland for the debate 

While President Trump's eldest daughter opted for a monochromatic pantsuit, his youngest went with a pop of color. 

Tiffany Trump, 26, made a statement in a hot pink blazer, which she wore over a black turtleneck. Her long blonde hair was loose around her shoulders and perfectly blowdried. 

She struck a pose with her half-brother Eric Trump's 37-year-old wife, Lara, who shared their selfie right before they flew to Cleveland. 

Most of the Trump women wore pantsuits to the debate, with Melania looking somber in black and white pinstripes.  

Happy: Kimberly Guilfoyle, 51, was all smiles when she arrived in Cleveland with her boyfriend, Donald Trump Jr. 

Outfit: Kimberly donned a structured white top, matching dress pants, and a $134 black tote from Hemline that has 'Rock & Roll' written in pearls

She didn't wear an American designer, however. Instead, she chose a $3,340 suit from Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana. 

Melania wore her perfectly tailored blazer open, revealing her crisp white button-down shirt, and she topped off the look with a pair of sky-high black stilettos. 

Her highlighted brown hair was styled in loose waves, and she sported a pair of aviator sunglasses when she stepped off Air Force One with her husband. 

Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, 51, stood out in a structured white top and matching pants.  

Strictly business: First Lady Melania Trump donned a $3,340 pinstripe suit from Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana

Ready to go: Melania wore her perfectly tailored blazer open, revealing her crisp white button-down shirt, and she topped off the look with a pair of sky-high black stilettos

She added a touch of playfulness to her all-white look with a $134 black tote from Hemline that has 'Rock & Roll' written in pearls. 

Tuesday's debate begins at 9:00 p.m. at Case Western Reserve University. 

President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are slated to discuss and debate their records, the Supreme Court, the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, race and violence, and election integrity with moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. 

Trump will also face questions over a recent New York Times report claiming the billionaire president only paid $750 in federal taxes in 2016 and 2017.
