Six states have been removed from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut's mandatory quarantine list after a week of improvements in coronavirus infection rates.     

Under a Tuesday update to the travel advisory, visitors from California, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada and Ohio will no longer be required to self-quarantine for 14 days after entering the tri-state area.  

Thirty states remain on the quarantine list imposed by Govs Andrew Cuomo, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont back in June for areas where the positive COVID-19 test rate is higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a seven-day rolling average.   

Puerto Rico was added to the list on Tuesday after its rate rose above the acceptable level. 

Six states were removed from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut's mandatory quarantine list on Tuesday after showing a week of improvements in coronavirus infection rates. Thirty states (shown above in red) remain on the list - meaning that people traveling from them must self-quarantine for two weeks upon arrival in the tri-state area

Governors in the tri-state area - once the epicenter of the US coronavirus crisis - have been working hard to keep cases down as other states continue to struggle with flattening the curve.  

The quarantine policy was implemented to help ensure that visitors from states with high coronavirus rates don't inadvertently spread infection in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 

The policy requires travelers from the states on the list to fill out a location form with information about where they came from and where they're going before they leave airports and other arrival hubs. 

Airlines have been handing the forms out on planes and they are also available online. 

Earlier this month New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that sheriff's deputies would also be boarding buses that arrive in Manhattan and ordering riders to fill out the forms.   

State officials have been using the forms to randomly track travelers and ensure they're following quarantine restrictions. Those who do not comply face fines of $2,000. 

 Returning residents and travelers must fill out an online health form and quarantine for 14 days  if they have arrived from any of the following states:



As of Tuesday, New York has reported 449,941 cases and 33,030 deaths after several consecutive weeks of gradual decline.  

Connecticut has reported 54,895 cases and 4,485 deaths, and New Jersey has reported 197,068 cases and 16,160 deaths. 

On Monday Cuomo announced that the state has seen 38 straight days with a positivity rate below one percent. 

Meanwhile, the average positivity rate nationwide has hovered around five percent. 

As of Tuesday, nearly 6.7 million cases and 198,440 deaths have been reported nationwide.
