Accompanying the heartwarming snaps was a lengthy caption by Nikki, which read, 'Oh my heart!! I’m the luckiest to have an incredible family! There is nothing better than that! Especially when you need them the most. (They all even came together to watch and cheer Artem on!)' 

'Matteo loves his Uncle Vey Vey, Auntie Brizee, GG, Bir Bir, Bud Bud and Uncle Bryan soooo much. And so do I'.

'We missed you Auntie Lola, Vi and Baby A! We want to come see you! We love you so much too!!'

The ex of wrestler John Cena continued: 'The one of Bryan is when Artem first left to go dance and I was having so much trouble getting Matteo to sleep. Uncle Bryan came to the rescue and Matteo slept so hard! lol Bryan is literally the baby whisperer it’s amazing! He’s has taught me SO much! (His shirt says it all!)' 

'And a lot of you have asked about an update on my Mom, our GG is one of the strongest women I know! Everyday she dedicates time to try something new to heal her face and brain. Days can be hard but she never gives up! She has a long road ahead of her but her journey so far has been nothing but inspirational! Beyond proud that she’s my Mama and Teo’s GG!!'

'Soon Teo gets to meet his Tata too!!' she concluded.
