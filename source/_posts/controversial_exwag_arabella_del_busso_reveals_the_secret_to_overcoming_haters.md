She's one of Australia's most controversial NRL WAGs. 

And it appears Arabella Del Busso refuses to let the haters get her down. 

On Tuesday, the 30-year-old brunette bombshell hit out against negative energy on her personal Instagram page - and appeared to offer advice to others. 

Wise words: On Tuesday, controversial ex-WAG Arabella Del Busso (pictured) said the secret to overcoming haters is to simply live your life with 'integrity and love' 

'You can't control how other people receive your energy...' she began.

'Anything you do or say gets filtered through a lens of whatever personal issues they are going through... which is not about you so just keep doing your thing with as much integrity and love as possible.' 

This comes after rumours swirled that Arabella will appear on Channel Seven's new reality show, SAS Australia. 

'Nothing has been confirmed yet,' the brunette bombshell said when she was approached for comment.

Angry rugby league fans vented their frustration on Twitter after it was revealed on Sunday that Arabella could possibly join the cast. 

'I'll never watch Channel Seven putting a loser like that on shows how much credibility they have,' one fan tweeted.

 'I, for one, will not be tuning in... Absolutely disgusted in your efforts for ratings,' another added.

'It's very controversial at the moment, but hey haters will hate,' Arabella said in response to the backlash.

On Sunday, News Corp reported the lingerie model was among the growing list of celebrities including convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby and publicist Roxy Jacenko.

The military-style program will see the contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation techniques and physical challenges.

To date, Candice Warner, Merrick Watts and Nick Cummins are the only celebrities to confirmed to be joining previously announced Roxy and Schapelle.
