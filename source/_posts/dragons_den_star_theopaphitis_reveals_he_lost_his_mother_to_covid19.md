Theo Paphitis has revealed he lost his mother to Covid-19, while his father survived the virus after a stint in intensive care.

The British Greek-Cypriot businessman, 61, made famous by his appearances on the panel of Dragons' Den, also laid bare the devastating impact the pandemic has had on his high street stores.

In a conversation with Kathleen Saxton for Advertising Week 2020, Mr Paphitis - who is worth £290million according to the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List, admitted many of his central London branches of Ryman and Robert Dyas are 'haemorrhaging cash', adding: 'Our stores that took £100,000 a week, are taking £10,000.'

The retail tycoon and entrepreneur, who is married to Debbie Stocker and has five children, said the pandemic has been 'incredibly testing' for him and his family, however they were 'very fortunate' they had a large house with plenty of outdoor space when the country went into lockdown in March.

Dragon's Den star Theo Paphitis has revealed he lost his mother to Covid-19 while his father battled the virus in intensive care

'We weren't generally touched by Covid, apart from one pretty well serious incident where we lost my mother, and my father ended up in intensive care,' he explained. 

'He's recovered; sadly my mother had underlying health issues that tipped her over the edge. 

So it was a stressful time, not being able to go to funerals, not being able to do the normal things that we all do at times like that when we need to grieve.

'But as a family unit here in sunny Surrey, we coped, and just like everybody else we're trying desperately to live our lives as normal as possible.'

Mr Paphitis' family hail from Cyprus, where his father and grandfather worked on British bases. They were granted British passports when the UK government granted the country independence.

Mr Paphitis told how his mother, who had underlying health conditions, succumbed to the virus while his father has now recovered. Pictured as a young boy with his parents and brother in Venice on his family's first journey to England

He previously told The Daily Telegraph: 'My family were poor and the only asset they had was that British passport. My father bought a two-up two-down for £880 in Gorton, Manchester, when I was about seven. 

'We then moved to London but my parents split up, so my mother raised my brother and me. We lived in a council flat. My mum didn’t have any spare cash so there was never any pocket money.'  

Mr Paphitis, whose retail group also encompasses lingerie brand Boux Avenue and the London Graphic Centre, also spoke candidly about the impact of coronavirus on him professionally, in particular the challenges he faces as an employer complying with government advice.

'We're trying to say to people, please come back to the office, but you're going to have to sit on the Tube, next to somebody who's coughing and spluttering irrespective of mask,' he said. 

'And when you've got a family, it's very, very difficult to tell people exactly what they should be doing so. Lots of the decision making, has to be left to the individuals.'

Mr Paphitis also shared his perspectives on the lasting effects the pandemic will have on the retail sector, support provided by the government, and the challenges presented by having so many stores in central London.

Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc on the High Street, with 195,331 job losses now announced by major British employers since the start of lockdown in March. 

During his conversation with Kathleen Saxton for Advertising Week 2020 (pictured), Mr Paphitis said he believes Chancellor Rishi Sunak's decision to suspend business rates for a year has made 'a massive difference', but insisted it's 'nowhere near enough when you've also got central London rents'

Though his businesses have done 'pretty well online' during lockdown, with large growth as people adapted their shopping habits, the impact on his business empire was felt in stores.

Speaking about the loss of revenue at his branches, he said: 'You would ask yourself why you even open, but we're trying to do our best to keep our colleagues engaged. 

'We can't keep all of them engaged, sadly, because there isn't a demand to keep those doors open.

'The longer this goes on goes for, it's going to get very, very tough. The reality is there cannot be normality without a vaccine.'

While he believes Chancellor Rishi Sunak's decision to suspend business rates for a year has made 'a massive difference', he insisted it's 'nowhere near enough when you've also got central London rents'.

'Our stores that remain open will be where the landlord is working with us in the short term to allow our doors to be open,' he explained.

'Those landlords who are being absolutely knuckleheads will find that we'll be shutting those doors, because they will not be viable.'

He added that a lot of cash spent by the government to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the economy has 'probably been wasted'.

'[The government] was very slow in getting business loans and credit insurance [sorted], those sort of things that really make a difference, but they are working on it,' Mr Paphitis said, adding that he would 'hate to be in their position'. 

'They're working towards a more direct understanding of the areas of the economy that need further assistance. They mustn't blink now. If they do, they would have absolutely lost all the benefits they've spent a fortune trying to protect.'    

Mr Paphitis said he believes working habits will change forever as a result of the pandemic. 

Speaking about the loss of revenue at his High Street stores, Mr Paphitis said: 'You would ask yourself why you even open, but we're trying to do our best to keep our colleagues engaged'

'Everybody is going to change, and it's going to change everybody very differently. It's not going to be consistent,' he said.

'The minute this went on for more than a couple of weeks, you could see the writing quite clearly on the wall. People are looking at different ways of leading their lives. 

'Maybe that's a better balance of life by working, partly from home, which was a little bit of a taboo subject in the workplace.

'It was always felt that you [need] to be there first thing in the morning [and] you will be last to leave to show that you care and had passion for the business. That's not so true these days. It used to be black and white 50 years ago, but now it's not.

'It's about output. It's about delivery. It's about performance. It's about focus… Lots of people are now saying, "Life balance is an important factor for me. My two-bedroom flat in Putney? I can sell that, and I can buy a five-bedroom house in a wonderful village an hour and a half away from London. I can have my children go to a really good school. And I promise you [my employer] the delivery and the performance and the commitment. I'll pop in once a week or twice a week." We are going to find a lot more of that.'
