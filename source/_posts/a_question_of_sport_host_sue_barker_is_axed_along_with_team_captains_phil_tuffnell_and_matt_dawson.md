BBC have axed A Question of Sport host Sue Barker and team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tuffnell.

Sources claimed that bosses are planning a huge shakeup to the show in 2021, with the current trio set to film their final episode at the end of this month.

Sue has been the host of A Question of Sport for 23 years after taking over from David Coleman in 1997, while former rugby star Matt and England cricketer Phil joined the show in 2004 and 2008 respectively.

In a statement, a BBC spokesperson told The Daily Star on Sunday: 'We would like to thank Sue for her enormous contribution as the show's longest-reigning host over the last 23 years, and Matt and Phil for their excellent team captaincy over 16 and 12 years respectively.

'Together they have ensured A Question Of Sport remains a firm favourite with the BBC One audience.

'Sue, Matt and Phil's final series will be broadcast next year before the series returns with a new team.'

Sources also told the publication that BBC bosses thought it would be the perfect time to revamp the show after celebrating its 50th Anniversary earlier this year.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for the BBC for further comment.

Former tennis champion Sue took over as host of A Question Of Sport from commentator David in 1997.

She previously said: 'QS has been such a huge part of my life - from watching it with my family growing up through my tennis-playing days, and then, of course, as the presenter.'

Matt took over as team captain from jockey Frankie Dettori in 2002, while Phil joined the team to replace Scottish footballer Ally McCoist.

A Question Of Sport was planning to go on the road for a nationwide tour in May, but these plans were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The quiz show has seen an array of sporting stars appear on the panel, including Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, legendary footballer George Best and even Princess Anne, who was a guest to mark the show's 200th episode.
