The incident occurred Tuesday evening after the plane, carrying Vice President Mike Pence, departed Manchester-Boston Regional Airport en route to Washington, D.C. 

Video shared to Twitter showed the birds striking the aircraft about seven seconds after takeoff, with several sparks subsequently seen coming from the plane's right engine.
