Amanda Holden and husband Chris Hughes were diagnosed with PTSD and sought therapy following the death of their stillborn son Theo and to help conceive again.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, described how the couple attended a session before she discovered hypnotherapy which helped her 'believe in her body again'. 

Amanda revealed how she 'felt so responsible' for the loss with her describing how 'not a day goes by' that she does not think of Theo after he passed away in 2011.

Speaking to The Sun, the Heart Radio presenter explained how hypnotherapy gave her 'confidence' in her body which led her to welcoming her youngest Hollie a year later. 

'After we first lost him, Chris and I were diagnosed with PTSD so we went and had some therapy about that, as anyone would,' Amanda said.

She added: 'I just felt like everything was my fault, and I felt so responsible — what did I do wrong?'

Discussing her loss, Amanda added: 'There is not a day that goes by when I don't think about Theo, especially when a new school year begins.'  

Amanda spent several days in intensive care following the life-threatening childbirth of daughter Hollie Rose in 2012. 

The star did not see her newborn daughter for the first three days of her life as she was forced to recover in intensive care in hospital, where she was deemed to be in a 'critical condition'.

Amanda, who shares daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight, with Chris, also revealed lockdown, like many other families, has made her realise 'what is and isn't important'.

She described how she has put on half a stone during lockdown which has gone to her 'boobs and bum' with husband Chris 'not complaining in the slightest'.  

Amanda, who recently spoke of her new album Songs From My Heart, said she has embraced lockdown with Chris and the pair have enjoyed 'date nights' including watching 'sunsets with a glass of wine'. 

Earlier this week, Amanda fought back tears while appearing on Lorraine when she revealed her new single reminds Chris of their late son, Theo.

Exciting: Amanda revealed she's dedicated a song on her debut album Songs From My Heart to her late son Theo ahead of its release 

The TV star debuted her the song, With You, from the musical Ghost on YouTube on Thursday and Chris said it brought back memories of losing Theo back in 2011. 



Amanda said: 'It's a song about grief and loss. It's a very moving song. My whole album means so much for me. 

'I sing it a lot. My whole album in fact is about songs that mean so much to me and my family. It was my husband Chris who absolutely floored me one day when I was singing.   

'He said, 'The last two lines of that song really remind me of how we felt when we lost Theo' - who was our lovely little boy who was born sleeping. The last two lines are, 'you took my world away, you took my life away'.'

Amanda continued: 'Chris is a typically stoic man who was very supportive of me and our girl Lexie when it all happened and never took time for himself.

'So for him to come out with that sentence, it just floored me. That's the first single we thought to release - very emotional.'
