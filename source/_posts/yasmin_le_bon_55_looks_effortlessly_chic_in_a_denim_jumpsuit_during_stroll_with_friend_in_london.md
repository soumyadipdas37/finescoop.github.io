Yasmin is a fashion industry stalwart and was one of the world's highest paid models in the 1980s.   

It comes after the star previously revealed how she is determined to hold onto her 'rock'n'roll' style despite becoming a grandmother.

Speaking to The Telegraph's Stella magazine, she said:  'I wear more miniskirts now than I did in my twenties and thirties.

'The older you get, the more you need to hold on to your rock'n'roll. I like labels that design for people like me - characters who just never want to grow up.'

Yasmin and Duran Duran frontman husband Simon welcomed their grandson, whose mother is their middle daughter Saffron, 28, in 2018. 

The model also revealed how she has embraced the changes she's seen in herself as she's entered her fifties.

Although not 'ruling anything out' when it comes to having cosmetic procedures done in the future, the beauty did warn against fillers, thinking people should just use a great surgeon and 'save up for the face lift.'

Looking back on her long career, Yasmin revealed that she's keen to recycle looks and revisit what she already has in her wardrobe.

She said: 'I have no problem with wearing everything again' and is embracing her more 'flamboyant side.'

The British-Iranian model, who celebrated 33 years of marriage to Simon, 61, on December 27, has three daughters Amber, 31, Saffron and Tallulah, 26.
