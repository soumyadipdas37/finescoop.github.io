title: Jeff Bezos Blue Origin is set to break the record for rocket recycling tomorrow 
description: Jeff Bezos Blue Origin is set to launch its reusable New Shepard rocket for the seventh time. The missions would set a new record for rocket recycling, as SpaceX has only flown the Falcon 9 six times.

Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is launching its reusable New Shepard rocket Thursday, marking the craft's seventh consecutive flight and setting a new record for rocket recycling. 

Blue Origin will also complete its 13th trip to space, in which the rocket will carry 12 commercial payloads to space and back for mission NS-13.

Aboard the craft will be a lunar lending sensor demonstration for its partnership with NASA that will ride on the exterior of the rocket instead of inside the capsule to conduct a series of tests for human's return to the moon.

Mission NS-13 is set to kickoff Thursday, September 24 at 11:00am ET.

If Blue Origin succeeds, it will surpass SpaceX in reusing a rocket – the Elon Musk-owned company has recycled Falcon 9 six times.

New Shepard was initially designed for space tourism, which aims to bring up to six passengers to the edge of space and float in orbit for 10 minutes.

However, Blue Origin, just like its rival SpaceX, has hit a few bumps in the road and is still testing the rocket on payload missions.

New Shepard has flown more than 100 payloads in to space, but mission NS-13 is different, as some of the cargo will fly mounted on the outside of the booster.

The lunar landing sensor, which will reside outside the rocket, will test precision landing technologies for future missions to the Moon in support of the Artemis program.

This experiment will help Blue Origin and NASA understand how the technologies work together for determined a spacecraft’s location and speed as it soars to the moon.

‘The technologies could allow future missions—both crewed and robotic—to target landing sites that weren’t possible during the Apollo missions, such as regions with varied terrain near craters,’ Blue Origin shared in a news release.

‘Achieving high accuracy landing will enable long-term lunar exploration and future Mars missions.’

As a part of NASA’s Artemis Human Landing System program, Blue Origin is also leading the National Team, comprised of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper, to develop a Human Landing System to return Americans to the lunar surface.

The firm recently delivered a mockup of the crew lander vehicle that could take the first woman and next man to the moon.

The full-sized structure, although not functional, includes both the ascent and descent elements, and stands 40 feet tall.

The Bezos' owned-company announced its 'National Team 'and NASA installed the lander in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Texas where the vehicle will undergo tests.

Blue Origin, along with Elon Musk's Space X and Dynetics, were chosen to develop human landing systems for the mission set for 2024 and were awarded a 10 month contract totaling $967 million to make it happen.

However, until the Bezos-owned company gets to the moon it will continue to launch payloads to and from space
