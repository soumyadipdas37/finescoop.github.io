A schoolboy has thanked Marcus Rashford for his charity work in a letter in which he vowed to give his own toys to the needy before asking: 'Can you please join Spurs?'

The England and Manchester United star hit headlines earlier this year when he  forced a Government U-turn to ensure free school meal vouchers were provided to children throughout the summer.

He has since joined a child poverty task force backed by major supermarkets, and is now pushing ministers to make a list of reforms to tackle child poverty in the UK. 

Rashford, 22, last night shared a letter he received from Jack Lees, seven, who had written to the footballer to thank him for 'everything you do'.

Rashford, 22, last night shared a letter he received from Jack Lees, seven, who had written to the footballer to thank him for 'everything you do'

In the note, Jack said: 'I love all the work you've done, some amazing things to help families who need it.

'You have inspired me because you're so thoughtful and helped children through the hardest times of their life.

'You make me want to help others and be a better person. Because of you, we will donate more food to food banks and our toys and clothes to charity to help other families near us too.

'Your football skills also inspire me to practice my football more to be a better player.' 

Before he closed the letter, Jack asked: 'Can you please join Spurs?' 

Rashford posted the note to Twitter last night, writing: 'Dear Jack, thank you for your lovely letter. Really made me smile tonight.

'Keep being kind. That's what makes the world go round.' 

Dozens of social media users took to the comments to praise the exchange, with one writing: 'It will be letters like this, which you’ll keep, which will make you the proudest of what you did in your life.'

Along with his school meals campaign, Rashford has already helped to raise £20million to fund 3.9million meals for vulnerable children in lockdown

Another added: 'He’s an absolute legend, Honestly what he is doing is close to my heart and he is using his platform to inspire so many kids and help so many families. 

'Absolutely love the guy last few months.'

A third user said: The sincerity of his admiration... The straightforward ask at the end... The club crest so beautifully sketched at the bottom.of the page... 

'MY HEART!' 

Rashford forced an embarrassing Government U-turn earlier this year to ensure free school meals were provided to children throughout summer.

He has since joined a child poverty task force backed by major supermarkets, is now pushing ministers to make a list of reforms to tackle child poverty.

These include expanding the Free School Meals scheme, creating more school holiday activities for youngsters from the poorest backgrounds and raising the amount given to parents to help cover the cost of healthier foods.

Under his three-point plan, outlined in his letter to MPs, the striker wants to expand free school meals for every child in households on Universal Credit.

He also wants to expand holiday help for children on the Free School Meals scheme, with more food and activities  - which would benefit more than one million children.

Mr Rashford is also calling on the government to increase the value of Healthy Start Vouchers, which can be spent on milk, plain fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables, and infant formula milk, from £3.10-a-week to £4.25, while expanding the scheme to anyone on Universal Credit. 

The striker, who now lives in a £1.5million Cheshire mansion, grew up in a £150,000 terraced council house on the tough Northern Moor estate in Wythenshawe.

He cited his own experience of growing up on a council estate during his successful campaign to get the government to extend its Free School Meals throughout this summer.

Marcus Rashford was hailed as the hero of lockdown after his successful free school meals campaign became yet another unlikely victory for a young footballer who has already defied the odds to become one of England's top sportsmen. 

The 22-year-old star says leaving home aged 11 to join Manchester United's academy when his single mother Melanie struggled to feed the family has driven his campaign to ensure other children in the UK do not go hungry.  

Earlier this year, the England striker forced Boris Johnson into an extraordinary U-turn less than 24 hours after the Prime Minister refused to budge on finding £110million to give free school meals to £1.3million vulnerable children for six weeks over the summer.

Rashford hailed the news at the time, tweeting: 'I don't even know what to say. Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020.'

It caps an incredible lockdown for Marcus, who has used the past three months to recover from a double back fracture while also helping to supply three million meals for children out of school, raising around £20million along with charity FareShare. He is now joint-favourite to become BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Marcus, who earns £200,000-a-week at Man United and lives in a £1.8million mansion with a fleet of luxury cars, has not said how exactly much he has donated himself but admitted he started the fund with '£50,000 to £60,000' of his own money with Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and wealthy individuals handing over millions more.

He grew up in a £150,000 terraced council house on the tough Northern Moor estate in Wythenshawe, where the hit series Shameless was filmed in an area of Manchester that has suffered badly from high crime rates, poverty and drug problems.
