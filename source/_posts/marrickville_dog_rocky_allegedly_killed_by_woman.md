A woman has been charged with torturing and then killing a dog after a domestic dispute in Sydney's inner west.

The 24-year-old woman allegedly tortured, beat and then killed Rocky on Cahill Place at Marrickville about 1.30am on Saturday.

Rocky, a 13-year-old English Staffordshire Bull Terrier, was found with cuts across its neck and was rushed to a nearby vet for surgery, but could not be saved. 

Police were initially called to the scene after the 24-year-old woman was involved in a dispute with a 44-year-old woman who was known to her inside a unit.
