She's a busy mother-of-one who balances household duties with her demanding job as an Instagram influencer. 

And on Tuesday, former Big Brother star Skye Wheatley, 26, announced on Instagram that she's on the hunt for a 'full time live-in nanny' to help ease the domestic workload and look after her son Forest, one.   

Bizarrely, however, Skye said she refuses to hire anyone that follows her on Instagram or has any idea about her celebrity status.

In a lengthy essay, Skye explained that she 'just needs help' with cleaning, cooking, house chores and looking after Forest. 

'I don't really want them to know who I am which is why this is kinda stupid [of] me putting this on my Instagram,' the online model admitted. 

'But if anyone knows any friend of a friend of a friend or if anyone knows anyone that isn't huge on social media please let me know,' she added.

Unusual request: In a subsequent post, Skye clarified that she won't be hiring a 'current follower', adding: 'I really want someone who doesn't know me or my business already' 

The blonde, who boasts 616K followers on Instagram, claimed that while most Instagram stars 'keep this part of their lives super private', she wants to be transparent with her followers. 

'I'm someone who loves working in a team and I've always needed extra help in my life,' she insisted.

She welcomed Forest with her tradie boyfriend Lachlan Waugh back in 2018. 

Last month, the Gold Coast glamazon hinted she's planning to welcome a second child by sharing sharing a very telling Instagram post. 

Posing for a mirror selfie with Lachlan and Forest, Skye wrote in the caption: 'I asked Forest if he wanted or sister or a brother and he said 'yes''.
