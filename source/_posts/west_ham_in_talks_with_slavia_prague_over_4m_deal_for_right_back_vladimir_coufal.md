West Ham are discussing a possible £4million deal for Slavia Prague right back Vladimir Coufal.

Manager David Moyes is eager to strengthen in that position after Ryan Fredericks picked up a hamstring injury in the 4-0 win over Wolves on Sunday evening.

Coufal, 28, is a Czech Republic international and former team-mate of West Ham's Tomas Soucek. He was part of the Czech side that beat England 2-1 last October in the European Championship qualifiers, though struggled against the pace of Raheem Sterling.

Moyes is intent on adding a centre back and ideally another midfielder before the window closes.

After seeing bids for Burnley's James Tarkowski and St Etienne's Wesley Fofana flounder, West Ham are working through a list of other options. Fiorentina's 6ft 5ins Serbia international Nikola Milenkovic, 22, is one they are considering while Swansea's Joe Rodon is admired but unlikely.

Bruges' goalscoring midfielder Hans Vanaken is also among players Moyes is keen on.
