In April, Durek revealed to Femail the couple planned to move in together in the US so that they could be together, explaining: ‘I can tell you one thing. It (marriage) is definitely not off the table. 

'Our plans are eventually to live together with each other. Not in Norway, but in the US. 

‘And let me tell you, no matter what people say about us, it is our life. Märtha and I are going to live the way we decide to live,' he added at the time. 

He also said they kept in touch through video calls three times a day and both would cry because of how hard they found it to be separated.   

The couple have spent the last six months apart and are believed to have last seen one another in March  

Durek added that he calls Princess Märtha first thing when he wakes up in the morning.

‘There’s a lot of crying and sadness that we can’t see each other, but we also know what’s happening in the world and we are willing to be patient.

But we have each other and at least we have technology, so that we can see each other and talk all the time,’ he said.
