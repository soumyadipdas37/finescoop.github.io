'I talk to him about how I'm feeling in the lead up to my period, feeling a little down or sad or… I always say, "Darling give me space today, it's the time of the month." 

'I've explained to them [my family] about the hormones I'm experiencing since March, my last period.

'I've been having the really hot sweats, and then freezing cold… my body temperature is fluctuating all over the place. It affects your mood swings, I've been putting on more weight.'

Happy couple: The pair, who wed in 2007, shared several loved-up snaps from their Italian getaway
