A controversial Amazing Race Australia contestant has been charged with a serious driving offence.

Ashley Ruscoe was charged by police with driving on a suspended licence on the Pacific Highway at Nabiac on the New South Wales' Mid North Coast.

The 32-year-old was pulled over three hours north of Sydney, just before 10pm on August 7, on the way to South West Rocks.

Ruscoe is due to front a magistrate at Forster Local Court on September 23.

It is unclear why Ruscoe's licence was initially suspended. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ashley Ruscoe for comment.

Ruscoe was spotted leaving a Surry Hills restaurant in the passenger seat of a friend’s car earlier this week.

Meanwhile, on social media she has been documenting her recent travels from the back seat of Ubers. 

Ruscoe rose to fame as part of the 'Bondi influencers' team on The Amazing Race reboot in 2019.

She and then-partner Sidney Pierucci were controversial stars on the show, as they attempted to deceive fellow teams and cheated in challenges.

Ruscoe’s ex-partner and Amazing Race co-star Sidney was found guilty of common assault earlier this year, following an altercation between the pair in Bellevue Hill.

He was sentenced to a 12 months Conditional Release Order by a magistrate in February.

A Final Apprehended Violence Order was made by the court, ordering that Pierucci must not assault or threaten, stalk, harass or intimidate Ruscoe or destroy any property that belongs to her.

However, the pair were spotted reuniting in Bondi in April, and claim they are now on good terms as friends. 

Case: The announcement of their split came after Pierucci was slapped with an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) after an alleged domestic violence incident involving Ruscoe
