Last month, they put their main residence on the market for $23.95 million as they searched for a new home, amid news they are expecting their third child.

Weeks later, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen found themselves in escrow for their dream home with their home also in escrow as well.

While waiting for both deals to go through, the power couple have opted to lease a stunning Beverly Hills home in the meantime - featuring 11,438 square feet of space with six bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, according to the Dirt.com.

Wow factor: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have opted to lease a stunning Beverly Hills home, with 11,438 square feet of space, six bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, according to the Dirt.com

The lovebirds' main home reached an agreeable offer from a buyer just weeks after hitting the market, leading them into escrow.

However, they are 'accepting backup offers,' according to the MLS listing via Dirt.com; Their former home, which was their 'starter' home as a family, was previously owned by Rihanna, the outlet noted.

Their former home has 8,520 square feet, seven bedrooms and eight baths, located in the Beverly Hills Post Office area - which is the mountains above Beverly Hills. 

The duo needed to vacate their home quickly but are still in escrow themselves with their future residence, also in Beverly Hills, leading them to lease for the moment. 

Chrissy and John are parents to Luna Simone, four, and Miles, two; last month, they confirmed she's pregnant with their third child.

The Beverly Hills abode they are leasing sits on a third of an acre in the Beverly Hills Flats neighborhood, built in 2019 by Tag Front Architects.

The 11,438 square-foot glass-covered home has six huge bedrooms - including an incredible master suite - with 11 bathrooms.

The home they are leasing was on the market in November 2019 for $20 million, but underwent realtor changes and two price drops - with it then on the market for $16.3 million soon after, TheDirt.com reported.

However, soon after the final reduction in price, the home was yanked off the market.

The incredible modern home features the indoor/outdoor space with doors that slide all the way open for an uninterrupted view of the pool and perfect for Southern California's mostly mild weather.

There are two living rooms that are separated by an enormous fireplace, with a fitness center center, sauna, steam room and home theater within the massive estate.
