Friends actress Jane Sibbett has revealed that copped a barrage of criticism for playing Ross Geller's lesbian ex-wife on the hit sitcom.  

The 57-year-old, who played Carol Willick on the show, said there was plenty of backlash due to her character's sexuality. 

Speaking to Now to Love this week, Jane said that even her father wasn't too comfortable with the idea.

'It became apparent soon after there was suddenly a responsibility about being able to stand up against all of the people that were saying this was wrong, including my own father who had a really hard time with that,' Jane said.

She said she even copped criticism during TV talk show appearances at the time, but she became determined to stand up for equality. 

'I would have to break things down for them,' Jane said.

'And I felt like it was really important for me to be super clear; love is the most important, of all the things that we could possibly do love is the most important way forward from anybody.'

She said she received an outpouring of support from the gay community around the world.  

It comes after actress Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel Green in Friends, revealed the hotly-anticipated reunion had been delayed again until May next year.

She told Deadline last month that she was optimistic about the reboot, however, saying she was a 'glass half-full' person. 

'It's going to be super. You know what? This [delay] has given us more time to make it even more exciting and more fun than it would have been,' she said.

'I choose to see it as the glass is half-full that it got postponed. Look, we're not going anywhere. You're never going to get rid of Friends. You're stuck with us for life, guys.'

The reunion has been plagued with delays and HBO Max has now pushed the special back again due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is now surging in California. 

Filming won't take place until next May 'at the earliest', according to sources who spoke with Variety about the project.

The Friends reunion will be very different from the sitcom fans remember, and will instead be an 'unscripted special'.
