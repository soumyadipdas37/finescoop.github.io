Lewis Hamilton cruised to victory at the Belgian Grand Prix and then admitted it was so boring he would have sent himself to sleep.

The season is turning into a procession towards the Briton’s record-equalling seventh world title. 

And after his fifth win in seven races, Hamilton said: ‘I cannot speak for the fans now, but having been a fan in the (Michael) Schumacher era, I know what it is like. I was a teenager then. I would have woken up, had my bacon sarnie, watched the start, gone to sleep and then woken up to watch the end. If I were watching today, I would do the same and just tune into the highlights.

‘Fans need to understand this is not our fault. We are drivers, we come through the ranks, and we earn the position we have. We come to each weekend devoted and give absolutely everything to perform at our best.

‘The decision-makers, those who design the cars and set the rules, are the ones who can do a better job. I am hopeful that is what will happen in 2022 with a new type of car and we will see a different form of racing where we can follow closely and have better races.’ 

Max Verstappen is performing brilliantly in a Red Bull that is no match for the Mercedes car 

Hamilton holds a 47-point advantage over Max Verstappen, who is performing brilliantly in a Red Bull that is no match for the Mercedes cars. Bottas is 50 points, two whole race wins, behind his team-mate.

The Finn has been short of form since springing a win in the opening race in Austria, where Hamilton seemed distracted before finding total focus.

Two more wins will take Hamilton to 91, level with Schumacher.
