No horse has won back-to-back runnings of the Haydock Park Sprint since Be Friendly in the 1960s, but HELLO YOUMZAIN (Haydock, 3.25) can write himself into the history books on Saturday afternoon.

The Kodiac colt would boast an unblemished record at Saturday’s venue in three appearances but for a short-head defeat at the hands of San Donato two years ago. But he made amends in last year’s renewal of today’s Group One contest with a game defeat of The Tin Man.

The likes of Brando and Dream Of Dreams were left trailing in his wake that day and the latter was also conquered in the Diamond Jubilee when the duo met at Ascot in June.

Dream Of Dreams has since posted a career-best when slamming eight rivals by upwards of seven lengths in the Hungerford Stakes and remains a tough adversary.

But Hello Youmzain is fancied to make all for a landmark success.

The horse can become the first to secure back-to-back victories at Haydock since the 1960s
