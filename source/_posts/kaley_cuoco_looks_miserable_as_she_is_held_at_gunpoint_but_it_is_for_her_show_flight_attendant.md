She recently returned to New York City to resume filming her upcoming show, Flight Attendant, after the COVID-19 pandemic halted filming. 

And Kaley Cuoco was spotted on set for an intense scene, on Thursday, in which she was held at gunpoint. 

The dramatic moments came a day after she was reunited with her husband Karl Cook, following two weeks of quarantine before filming. 

Intense: Kaley Cuoco was spotted on set for an intense scene of her upcoming HBO Max show Flight Attendant, on Thursday, in which she was held at gunpoint on the streets of NYC

The 34-year-old actress was seen in the same outfit she was spotted filming in earlier in the week. 

She was wrapped up in a mid-calf length grey coat, and faded cropped jeans. 

Adding height to her style, she wore lugged bottom platform boots and carried a dark maroon leather handbag. 

A female assailant, played by Michelle Gomez, wore all black in tall boots, long pants and a long coat and handbag as she pointed the gun to Kaley's back.

She was later spotted in between takes, without her coat revealing the high neck black tank underneath, and attempting to cover her face in a black reusable face mask that fell beneath her nose.

She only recently recently returned to work on her HBO Max series, sharing some behind-the-scenes masked selfies earlier this month with co-star Michiel Huisman.

The suspenseful drama series went on hiatus back in March, as the COVID-19 lockdown forced Hollywood to temporarily shut down. 

The cast quarantined for two weeks upon arrival to New York, at the end of August, before getting back to filming.   

Production previously wrapped on all international locations, with about three episodes left to shoot.

Land that plane: She returned to NYC for filming in August and shared some behind-the-scenes masked selfies last week with co-star Michiel Huisman, writing, 'We’re back!! Keeping our distance of course!'

Kaley executive produces and stars as Cassie, a flight attendant who wakes up in a strange place with a dead man in her bed and no recollection of what happened.

'We'll be quarantined for two weeks and you'll get a look at our shenanigans, I'm sure. And then back to work. We only have like two and a half episodes left, so I'm going to wrap up by the beginning of October.'

The show, which is expected to premiere in November, is based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian.

Kaley continued: 'I don't have an exact date but that is exciting at all in itself. I don't know if you guys know this but I have been working on this project for three years. 

'It goes back to three years from when I actually found the original book, so it's very exciting for me, and then obviously developing it for over two years.'

Co-worker goals: She also shared another masked-up selfie over the holiday weekend with costar Zosia Mamet. The cast quarantined for two weeks upon arrival to New York, at the end of August, before getting back to filming
