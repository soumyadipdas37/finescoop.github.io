Blackburn Rovers put in a spirited performance at St James' Park but a goal from new signing Ryan Fraser meant Newcastle United came away as winners in the Carabao Cup tie.

Miguel Almiron sent Fraser away behind the defence with a super pass in the first half, and the Scotsman scored with his right foot from outside the box.

Blackburn had the better of the second half, however Newcastle had another goal disallowed when Almiron had the ball in the net but was found to be offside.
