Nova announced on Tuesday that at least four popular hosts were being sacked in response to the COVID-19 recession.

And one of those staff members was Nova Adelaide's afternoon presenter and sports anchor Jarrod Walsh.

Jarrod reacted to news of his redundancy on social media, sharing a tearful video in which he reflected on his 16-year career at the network.

'I was part of the start of Nova 919 in Adelaide, a new radio station, a new culture… that was 16 years ago. In September 2020, I have had my last day,' he said.

'I was one of a handful of good people who was made redundant from the radio station.

 'I was preparing myself mentally… but nothing can prepare you to hear those words.'

Jarrod broke down in tears as he reminisced about his time at Nova, and admitted he was feeling a mixture of 'fear, relief and anxiety' since hearing the news. 

Fellow radio presenter Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald, who started his career in Adelaide and now hosts Nova's Fitzy and Wippa breakfast show in Sydney, shared a touching tribute to Jarrod on Twitter.

'16 years Walshy, day 1 of Nova 91.9. Have no doubt you’ll be back mate, always room for someone to drive a Casanova van into a power line. Always here,' he wrote.

Jarrod began his career at Nova 919 Adelaide in 2004 hosting the night show, before eventually transitioning to the afternoon time slot.

His emotional update came shortly after Radio Today confirmed that Nova had decided to cut local workdays in Brisbane and Adelaide.

This change will also see Nova Brisbane hosts Katie Mattin and Jack Tree, and Nova Adelaide announcer Rosie Panetta depart the business or be redeployed.

The presenters were reportedly notified of the changes on Friday after their shifts.

Nova's programming and marketing boss, Paul Jackson, told Radio Today the network had been forced to 'review' its business as a result of the pandemic.

'It's been a tough time for all media industries during COVID and as a result we've reviewed every aspect of our business, including programming, to ensure we continue to deliver our listeners with the best content, announcers and shows, in the most efficient way,' he said.
