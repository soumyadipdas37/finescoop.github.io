Kim Kardashian is known for catering to those closest to her.

And the 39-year-old decided to host a gathering for her 'Lifers' on Tuesday evening, which consisted of plenty of confectionary treats and an intimate dinner.

Meanwhile, sisters Kylie Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, and mom Kris attempted to make the most of their night with boardgames, personalized donuts, and decadent snacks.

Kim's 'Lifers,' as the reality TV sensation explained in an interview with Fat Mascara last month, are 'a group of seven of us' who have 'been best friends since pre-school.'

This 'group of seven' happens to include Allison Statter, whom Kim just recently launched an entire KKW Beauty collection with.

In her interview with Fat Mascara last month, Kim explained that now that all seven of the 'lifers' have kids and are all 'turning forty this year,' that they are 'closer than [they have] ever been.'

Podcast hosts Jessica Matlin and Jennifer Goldstein were curious to know how Kim, Allison, and the rest of their 'Lifers' have managed to maintain their friendship for so long, despite all of them having unusually busy lives. 

'In life, we kind of made the choice to make time for each other,' said Kim. 'We are beyond besties, It's kind of like family.'

Challenge accepted: 'Game night,' wrote Kylie, 23, who showcased the copies of Candyland, Jenga, and more that she had on display at her house

She added that the group works so hard to set aside time to hang out and catch up because it is something they all see as an 'escape' from the stresses of their normal lives.

'It's our escape. We have been with each other through babies. We have used each other's baby nurses and baby clothes and hand-me-downs...' said Kim, before trailing off.
