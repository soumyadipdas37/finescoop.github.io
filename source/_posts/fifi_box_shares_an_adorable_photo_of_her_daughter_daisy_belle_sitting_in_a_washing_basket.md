She's a proud mother to daughter Trixie, seven, and Daisy Belle, one.

And on Thursday, Fifi Box shared an adorable photo of her youngest daughter sitting in a washing basket.

'Cutest load of washing I've done this week,' the radio host, 43, captioned the sweet post.

In the picture, an adorable Daisy Belle sat in the white washing basket and smiled at the camera.

Fifi's post comes one day after she shared a video of Daisy Belle cheekily flipping her mum the middle finger. 

In a video posted to Instagram on Wednesday, the radio host can be heard laughing from behind the camera.

Covered in pasta sauce, Daisy pulled a series of funny faces as her mum filmed her, bunching up her nose, pursing her lips and squeezing her eyes shut.

She then began repeatedly shaking her head while smirking, before subtly rubbing her nose with her middle finger, leaving Fifi in hysterics as she filmed the interaction.

'Happy little pasta eater (and yes I think she flipped the bird at me),' she captioned the video, adding a crying-with-laughter emoji.

In June 2019, Fifi welcomed daughter, Daisy Belle, via IVF and an anonymous donor. The identity of Daisy's father is not public knowledge.

Meanwhile, the radio host shares her daughter Trixie, with her ex Grant Kenny.  

In an interview with Show + Tell in October 2015, Fifi spoke about her life as a single mum, and confessed she doesn't get too overwhelmed.

'Motherhood was a challenge that I always hoped would maybe come along one day, which I looked forward to, and for me, it's my soul,' she said.

She continued: 'I've always felt it would be very natural, and I've always felt I am very maternal anyway, so for me, it's just the biggest blessing.'
