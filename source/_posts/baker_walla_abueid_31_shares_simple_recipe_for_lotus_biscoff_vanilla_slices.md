A self-taught baker known as Australia's 'Lotus Biscoff queen' has shared her simple recipe for vanilla slices flavoured with the iconic cinnamon spread – and you can make your own with four supermarket ingredients.

It's the latest creation from Walla Abu-Eid, a busy teacher and mother-of-three young girls who became 'Instagram famous' by sharing the decadent desserts she whips up in the kitchen of her Guilford home in Sydney's inner-west.

In a video on her Instagram highlight reel, the 31-year-old – who learned to bake on Google and YouTube and says 'anyone can do the same' – shows viewers how to make their own with cream, biscuits, instant pudding and a jar of Biscoff spread.

Fans have branded Ms Abu-Eid a 'genius' with 'golden hands' who is capable of turning typically time-consuming desserts into quick and easy recipes suitable for bakers of all skill levels - even beginners.

The gifted chef starts by lining the base of a baking tray with a layer of Arnott's lattice biscuits, available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.

To make the filling, Ms Abu-Eid adds 600ml of double cream to a bowl and sprinkles a packet of Cottee's instant vanilla pudding mix on top, then whisks for roughly one minute until the mixture is thick and fluffy.

Next, she heats a jar of Biscoff in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften the spread. Once cooled, she spoons it into the pudding mixture, folding together until smooth.

Finally, Ms Abu-Eid pours the vanilla mixture over the biscuit base and covers it with a second layer of biscuits before leaving it to set in the fridge for 15 minutes.

The slices can be topped with a dusting of icing sugar or a simple sugar glaze made from water and icing sugar, but this is optional.

Followers flooded the comments section with gushing responses, with many thanking Ms Abu-Eid for her straightforward instructions which have encouraged them to bake for the first time in their lives.

'Okay wow, I thought I wouldn't make anymore [desserts with] Biscoff but I've got to try this,' one woman replied, tagging her friends.

'Oh my God that looks delicious. On my list for this weekend,' said another. 

And it's far from the first Biscoff-inspired treat on her Instagram feed, which is filled with carefully curated photos of doughnuts, mousses and tarts all built around the distinctive cinnamon sweet. 

Ingredients

- 1 or 2 packets Arnott's lattice biscuits (depending on the size of your tray) 

- 600ml double cream

- 200ml lotus biscoff spread

- 100g Cottees instant vanilla pudding

(Optional: 3/4 cup icing sugar and enough cream or milk to dissolve it)

Method

1. Place one layer of biscuits in a baking tray.

2. Add cream into a bowl and sprinkle pudding mix on top. Whisk or whip until it thickens - this should take roughly one minute.

3. Place Biscoff jar in the microwave for about 30 seconds to melt the spread. Make sure it's not hot, then pour over the pudding mixture. Fold both together until well incorporated.

4. Pour Biscoff vanilla pudding mixture over biscuit layer, smooth and finish off with a second layer of biscuits.

5. Dust with icing sugar or glaze and leave in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.

Earlier in September, the 31-year-old revealed the recipe for her widely acclaimed Lotus Biscoff lasagne, a reinvention of the classic Italian dinner which has been shared by more than 60 global news outlets.

In a video filmed for Instagram TV, she whipped up the decadent, cheesecake-style creation with five ingredients: sugar, cream, vanilla extract, biscuits and Biscoff spread.

To make the filling, Ms Abu-Eid mixes a carton of thickened cream with a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract, whipping until 'soft peaks' form in the mixture.

It should be thick and slightly stiff without being over beaten, which causes the cream to curdle.

Next, she heats a jar of Biscoff spread in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften – and then gets down to assembling the dessert.

Ms Abu-Eid lines the base of a glass baking dish with Biscoff biscuits, then covers them with the sugar and cream mixture.

She drizzles some melted Biscoff spread over the cream, then repeats the process three times, ending with a layer of cream on top.

Scooping any remaining spread into a piping bag, she pipes thin lines onto the cream and runs through them with a skewer or toothpick, creating an ornate triangular pattern.

Fans have branded Ms Abu-Eid's sweet lasagne a 'work of art' and a 'culinary masterpiece' on social media

Finally, she crumbles leftover biscuits into fine crumbs and sprinkles them around the edge of the dish for decoration.

Fans have hailed Ms Abu-Eid's dessert lasagne a 'work of art' and a 'culinary masterpiece' on social media, where a video of the preparation has racked up over 85,000 views.

The gifted baker also makes the lasagne in the shape of a classic cheesecake for customers on her up-and-coming bakery page, Bake My Cake by Walla.
