Everton have agreed to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure from Watford for a fee of around £20million.

The 27-year-old will travel to Merseyside to undergo his medical in the next 48 hours.

Everton are overseeing a rebuild of their midfield in this transfer window, with James Rodriguez and Allan also close to joining the club.

Everton have agreed to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure from Watford for a fee of around £20m

Rodriguez is set to join from Real Madrid for over £20million, while Allan is on the verge of signing from Napoli for £21million, meaning Everton will have spent around £65million on improving their midfield.

Doucoure was eager to remain in the Premier League following Watford's relegation to the Championship.

Colombia midfielder James Rodriguez is expected to arrive from Real Madrid for over £20m

Allan is set to join Everton from Napoli for £20m as the club continue their recruitment drive

The Frenchman possesses plenty of Premier League experience having made 129 appearances in the division for Watford.

Doucoure's ability to drive forward from midfield is a useful asset and the arrival of Rodriguez will also bolster Everton's creativity. 

Earlier in the transfer window Everton secured a deal for left-back Niels Nkounkou, who was previously at Marseille.
