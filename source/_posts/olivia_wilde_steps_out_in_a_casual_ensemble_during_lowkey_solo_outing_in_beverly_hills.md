She's set to be extremely busy over the coming months as she has a whopping four directorial projects in the pipeline. 

But despite her busy schedule, Olivia Wilde showed no signs of taking it easy as she was spotted with her hands full while out and about in Beverly Hills on Tuesday.

The actress, 36, cut a casual and somewhat windswept figure as she ran errands during a low-key solo outing.

The Tron: Legacy star dressed down in a printed white T-shirt, cropped tan trousers and fluffy black sliders as she made her way around the Californian city.

Olivia stayed protected in a blue patterned face mask, while she shielded her eyes with a pair of brown-tinted sunglasses.

The star's brunette tresses swept behind her as she was caught in a gust of wind as she walked.

And the Booksmart director clearly had a busy day ahead as she juggled a blue box, a straw hat and a large black handbag.

The beauty was without fiancé Jason Sudekis, 44, during her outing, while their children, son Otis, six, and daughter Daisy, three, were not present either. 

Olivia will no doubt be making the most of any family time as she juggles four major projects.

The Life Itself actress made her directorial debut last year with high school comedy Booksmart and has clearly developed a taste for working behind the camera.

Her next project, Don't Worry, Darling - a psychological thriller about a 1950s housewife - is in pre-production.

The film has already generated a lot of buzz, with Harry Styles, Dakota Johnson, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine signed on to star.

Olivia will also direct Perfect, a biopic about gymnast Kerri Strug for Searchlight Pictures and an untitled holiday-comedy film for Universal Pictures.

She was recently announced to direct an upcoming female-led Marvel film for Sony Pictures, which some believe will be a Spider-Woman movie.

No character details have been revealed, but Olivia dropped a hint when she tweeted the news with a spider emoji.
