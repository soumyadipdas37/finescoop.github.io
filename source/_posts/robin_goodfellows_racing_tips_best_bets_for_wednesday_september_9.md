Side with MUBTASIMAH (Doncaster, 3.15) to prove herself the jewel in the bet365 Sceptre Fillies Stakes.

A return to turf could be the catalyst to a better performance from the Dark Angel filly, who posted a rare below-par effort at Chelmsford when last seen. But there may have been excuses for that defeat.

The winner that day, Miss Celestial, made all of the running while the runner-up and third home were both well positioned towards the head of affairs, unlike Wednesday’s selection, who was switched off in rear before making late headway.

That performance was in contrast to her impressive comeback display when landing a sizeable gamble at Newbury. After travelling powerfully, she put a competitive race to bed with an impressive change of pace to register a valuable first Listed success, with her Chelmsford conqueror, Miss Celestial, one of those beaten.

That trademark change of gear is a potent weapon at this afternoon’s level and a dry night and quickening ground would help Mubtasimah to once again showcase her talents.

FLYING DRAGON (Doncaster, nap, 2.40) is a far from prolific winner, but was perhaps a shade unfortunate not to improve that strike rate at Salisbury on his most recent start.

September appears to be the selection’s time of year with a win, three seconds and a couple of third-place finishes from six starts.

And he will hopefully give it a good go in trying to improve on a narrow defeat in this event 12 months ago.

Pat Dobbs takes over in the saddle from a young apprentice and his mount appears to have been slowly reaching a peak judged on recent efforts, a second at Salisbury — and at Beverley last month, when staying on well to grab fifth from a difficult position.
