The upcoming series of Netflix's The Crown is set to show Princess Diana's heartbreaking battle with bulimia in a move which might cause Princes Harry and William to clash. 

Close friends previously said the devastating eating disorder triggered by her broken marriage caused the Princess of Wales to start 'fading away'.

And in its upcoming fourth season, Peter Morgan's hit show The Crown will portray her struggle in the 1980s for the first time, making William and other senior royals 'incredibly uncomfortable', a source said.

It comes after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry signed a deal with streaming giant Netflix said to be worth some £75million.

Actress Emma Corrin, 24, will portray her vomiting after eating. Production company Left Bank Pictures said that eating disorder charity BEAT were on hand to ensure any portrayal was correct and sensitive.

A source told The Sun: 'William and other senior royals are incredibly uncomfortable about this drama and livid Harry is now in partnership with the company that's airing it.'

'It's the latest in a long line of flashpoints between the brothers, but there are few more sensitive subjects than the plight of their mother.'

They said the Firm 'wouldn't expect one of their own to take money made by the profits of shows like this'. 

The highly-anticipated upcoming fourth season will take Diana from her early days as a shy kindergarten teaching assistant to a fairytale princess and an iconic global figure, as well as explore the early days of her disastrous marriage to Prince Charles.

Her entrance comes when it returns to our screens in November or December, almost exactly 40 years after Nigel Dempster revealed in the Daily Mail in 1980 that Charles had found his 'future bride', having transferred his attention to Diana Spencer from her older sister Sarah.

Like Diana at the time, the actress playing her in The Crown is also a young unknown.  

Corrin is a privately educated Cambridge graduate, who didn't go to drama school.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed a deal with streaming giant Netflix said to be worth some £75million 

Harry and Meghan now live in a $14.7 million home in Los Angeles. The Netflix deal will help them pay for their new home and for their security costs, said to be over $5 million a year

By coincidence she's originally from Sevenoaks in Kent, where Diana went to West Heath School from the age of 12 to 16.

It comes as Meghan, 39, and Harry, 35, signed an enourmous deal with streaming giant Netflix.

As part of the deal, the couple will make documentaries, films, scripted and kids' programmes for the platform's 193m subscribers.

Insiders have however said the commercial deal will be 'scrutinised' by the Palace. 

Harry and Meghan follow President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, who announced in 2018 they had entered a multi-year producing partnership with the online streaming service.

In January, the couple announced that they would be stepping back as senior members of the British Royal Family, and now, eight months later, live in a $14.7 million estate near Los Angeles. 

Last year's royal accounts showed the cost of the renovations at the Frogmore cottage - paid for from taxpayers' money - was £2.4 million ($3 million). Following the Netflix deal, Harry and Meghan were able to pay the cost to the taxpayer off in full

It was learned last week that Prince Charles had cut off his private funding support for Harry and Meghan after they secured the Netflix deal and paid back £2.4million ($3 million) for Frogmore Cottage - their UK residence.

In a move which surprised some royal sources, Harry and Meghan reimbursed taxpayers in full for the amount spent on renovating their Windsor home.

The couple – who had been paying back the cash in monthly instalments – announced that they had totally refunded the Sovereign Grant for the redevelopment of five-bedroom Frogmore Cottage on the Queen's Berkshire estate.

The couple are 'relieved and pleased' to pay off renovation costs, a source claimed.
