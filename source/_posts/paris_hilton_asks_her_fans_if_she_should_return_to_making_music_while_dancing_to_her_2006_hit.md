Three years after she became a household name on The Simple Life in 2003, Paris Hilton released her debut single, Stars Are Blind. 

And on Wednesday, the socialite-turned-DJ asked her 12.5million Instagram followers if she should 'get back in the studio' to make new music. 

In a new video she can be seen lip-syncing to her hit reggae-pop track in a black crop top, which read: 'Never pass a mirror without looking in it.'

The bombshell has also released a love song about her then-fiancé, Chris Zylka in 2018 and the iconic Kim Kardashian-inspired track Best Friend's Ass last year. 

In the video she tries on many different outfits. 

After displaying her taut midriff and swaying back and forth, the 39-year-old singer flipped her blonde tresses forward and instantly appeared in a skintight white minidress, which showcases her slender frame. 

Once in her new look, Paris smoldered at the camera behind her stunning winged eyeliner and flawlessly applied makeup.

As she maintained her signature loose waves throughout the clip, the over-the-top business mogul appeared completely in her element, as the song's chorus played in the background.   

In less than 17 hours, the footage on TikTok already received 5.6million views and applause from artists, including Meghan Trainor, who commented her performance was 'legendary.' 

Her entire comment section on both Instagram and TikTok was flooded with fans encouraging her to record new music, with many telling her to 'save pop again' and how much they still love Stars Are Blind.

Her playful video comes one day after opening up about her past toxic relationships with multiple ex-boyfriends. 

'I went through multiple abusive relationships,' Paris told People. 'I was strangled, I was hit, I was grabbed aggressively. I put up with things no one should.'

Paris believes she was set up for a future of abusive relationships while attending the Provo Canyon boarding school as a teenager.

Paris claims she endured emotional abuse at the hands of the school during the 11 months she attended, which was intended to focus on her mental and behavioral development.

The socialite alleges she was physically abused and berated by the boarding school.

Eventually, Paris began to normalize the behavior.

'I had become so used to [abusive behavior] at Provo, that it made me feel like it was normal,' she continued. 

Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.

'They all seemed like such nice guys and then the true colors would show,' Paris explained. 'They'd get jealous, or defensive or try to control me. And there there would come a point where they would become physically, verbally and emotionally abusive.'

Paris initially interpreted the 'crazy' behavior as an indicator of just how much they loved her. 

In 2003, Paris landed at the center of a scandal after her infamous sex tape was leaked to the public.

But Paris believes the tape never would have happened had she not attended Provo. 

Soulmates: Hilton said, 'I'm so grateful to have found my perfect match' 

'I would never have let anyone into my life like [the man in the tape, whom she was dating at the time]. I met the worst person I could meet and if I hadn't gone to Provo, I wouldn't have entertained the thought of letting him into my life. Provo affected my future relationships. 

Nowadays, Paris is in a 'safe' and healthy relationship with entrepreneur Carter Reum, whom she has been dating for nine months.

'I feel so safe with him,' she told the magazine. 'Before, I don't think I was really ready for a good relationship. But I've learned so much. And I'm so grateful to have found my perfect match.'
