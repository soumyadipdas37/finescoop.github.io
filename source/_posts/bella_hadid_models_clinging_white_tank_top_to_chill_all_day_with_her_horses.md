She is a longtime lover of horses.

And Bella Hadid enjoyed some quality time with her equine pals at the family farm in Pennsylvania this week.

The 23-year-old slipped into a clinging white tank top that emphasized her supermodel figure as she posed up for Instagram.

She threw a light cream cardigan over the tank top and slipped into a pair of high-waisted brown bell-bottoms.

The sizzling sensation clambered onto the back of one horse for a ride and at another point she lay on the grass as another horse ambled about nearby.

Bella, whose mother is Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills Yolanda Hadid, captioned the album: 'we really just chill all day.'

The sister of Gigi Hadid also posted an Instagram upload that showed her in a cozier ensemble as she cuddled up to one horse in the stables.

She could be glimpsed through the window wearing an old-fashioned bomber jacket and a pair of khakis and petting the animal.

Her horse posts come hours after she set the Internet ablaze with a throwback snap taken on the farm this June with Gigi.

Gigi is expecting her firstborn child with her boyfriend Zayn Malik and could be seen in the snap cradling her baby bump in a dress.

Bella revealed that the picture was taken on June 11 and gushed that 'i love you both so freaking much -can'tstopcrying.'
