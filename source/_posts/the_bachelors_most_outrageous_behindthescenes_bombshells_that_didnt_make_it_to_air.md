This year's season of The Bachelor has been engulfed with shocking rivalries, friendships turned sour and stunning intruders.

And if that wasn't enough to whet a viewer's appetite, there has reportedly been a whole host of outrageous scenes that haven't made it to air.

According to New Idea, many women ended up 'obsessing' over a producer who was 'much hotter' than Locky Gilbert, while elsewhere they let off steam with some incredibly raunchy pool parties.

The publication reports that the girls' attention would be frequently diverted from Locky as they 'would flirt with a cute assistant at every opportunity.'

'Some of the girls even found him on social media when they left the mansion and slid into his DMs.'

Helping the ladies loosen up, Locky reportedly would 'run through the mansion in his undies' and jump into the pool.

The other girls would follow suit by jumping in after him.

It was also said that some of the women, particularly Izzy, were so comfortable with each other that they would often walk around naked.

'It was awkward when the crew arrived, and they were told to cover up,' the source said.

Furthermore, it's revealed that the girls would continuously send Locky small gifts during lockdown in a bid to win his heart.

Others reportedly enjoyed a slew of 'secret one-on-one phone chats' with him and were ordered to stay 'tight-lipped' after returning to the house following lockdown.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10.
