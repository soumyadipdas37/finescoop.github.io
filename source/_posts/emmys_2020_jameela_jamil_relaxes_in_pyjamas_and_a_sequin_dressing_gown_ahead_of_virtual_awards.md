She's used to putting on a glamorous display during awards nights.

And Jameela Jamil was able to rock a more casual look for Sunday night's 72nd Emmys as she relaxed ahead of the virtual awards in her pyjamas.

The Good Place actress, 34, also shared a glimpse into her getting ready process revealing she still applied her makeup and styled her hair for the big night.

Relaxing: Jameela Jamil swapped red carpet glam for her pyjamas and a sequin dressing gown as she prepared to watch the virtual 72nd Emmys on Sunday night from her home

Jameela looked sensational as she awaited the show which will see host Jimmy Kimmel will anchor the show from LA's Staples Centre.

Making sure to still dress up slightly for the occasion, the Good Place star added a sequin dressing gown to complete her ensemble.  

Alongside her stunning snap, Jameela penned: 'No bra? No heels? NO PROBLEM.

'Wearing PJ’s to the 72nd Emmy awards (from my house) is my kind of vibes. Excited to see if we win any of the 7 awards we have been nominated for!!!!

Getting glam: The actress added that even though she wouldn't be at the event in person she was still going to put some makeup on to watch the show from her sofa

'I still did my make up and wore a sequin dressing gown, because... It’s what Tahani would have wanted. And this is her day, not mine.'

While on her previous post Jameela wrote: 'Getting ready for the Emmys later on, doing some make up, wearing some stuff.' 

Jameela's show The Good Place, in which she plays character Tahani Al-Jamil, is up for several awards during the night including Outstanding Comedy Series.

The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards will take place with a largely virtual ceremony due to the pandemic on Sunday night.

Enjoying it: Jameela said watching the show from her home in pyjamas was her 'kind of vibes' 

Getting ready: The star shared that she was feeling excited ahead of the show and was going to put some makeup on to watch from home 

Producers have sent over 130 home video kits to stars for their remote speeches, and Jimmy Kimmel will anchor the show from the Staples Centre as other presenters are set to deliver gongs to some of winners' homes in full tuxedo hazmat gear. 

Host Jimmy, 52, admitted the traditional glitz and glamour could end up a 'beautiful disaster' as the Emmys becomes the latest major awards show to grapple with holding a ceremony during a still-raging pandemic.

Choosing the comedian to emcee the ceremony reverses course from last year's no-host ceremony. 

Jimmy is no stranger to hosting the gala event as he has served as master of ceremonies at the 64th in 2012 and 68th Emmy Awards in 2016.

Role: Jameela plays Tahani Al-Jamil in The Good Place and the series is up for several awards during the night including Outstanding Comedy Series (pictured at a show panel in 2018)

The entertainment industry has restarted production following a lengthy shutdown of Hollywood to minimise the spread of COVID-19. 

A first look at the special gear revealed presenters protective attire - a typical black hazmat suit with an oversized black bowtie over a triangular patch of white dress shirt with white sleeve cuffs.

Costume designer Katja Cahill and producer Guy Carrington worked with a hazmat manufacturer on the custom look. 

Executive producer Reggie Hudlin previously guaranteed an entertaining show, telling Variety: 'From category to category, it’s going to change throughout the broadcast. 

Unusual look: Presenters will wear protective attire which looks similar to a tuxedo with a white dress shirt with white sleeve cuffs during the event

'Some of them may not work, but we said, "Let's just experiment and have the audience a little more on the edge of their seats."'

Although Reggie added that technical difficulties will likely arise, funnyman Kimmy is gearing up to keep audiences entertained as he added: 'I think he’s hoping things go wrong. 

'If we’re in someone’s house and something extraordinary happens, why would you want to cut it off? 

'We’re thankful ABC understands our problem. It could come way under, it could go over. It might be on time. I think that’s unlikely.'

Leading the Brits are Olivia Colman and Jodie Comer, who are competing for the Best Actress in a Drama Series category for their portrayals as the Queen in The Crown and Oksana Astankova/Villanelle in Killing Eve respectively.  

Let the crazy begin! Jimmy Kimmel will host the awards from the Staples Centre in Los Angeles but the nominees will be on video link from their own homes and there will be no live audience

Screen stars Olivia and Jodie will compete with other big names in the business, including Jennifer Aniston, The Morning Show; Laura Linney, Ozark; Sandra Oh, Killing Eve; and Zendaya, Euphoria.  

Normal People's Irish star Paul Mescal scored his nomination for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role as Connell, but his co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones and the BBC show were snubbed, a decision he previously insisted was 'disappointing'. 

The actor is competing against Jeremy Irons for Watchmen, while The Crown's Helena Bonham Carter and Westworld actress Thandie Newton go head to head for the Supporting Actress in a Drama Series prize.

Other British nominees include Succession stars Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen, who have scooped nominations in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor in a Drama Series categories respectively.

Outstanding drama series, considered by many the biggest award on the night, will this year feature The Crown, Better Call Saul, The Handmaid's Tale, Killing Eve, The Mandalorian, Ozark, Stranger Things and Succession. 

Jennifer Aniston is nominated for her role in Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, Laura Linney is up for Ozark and Comer's Killing Eve co-star Sandra Oh also grabbed a nod. 

HBO's Watchmen is the most nominated show, with 26 nods, including for outstanding limited series.
