Hundreds of traders and sales staff at JPMorgan will be returning to London's business districts this month as the banking giant ordered more workers to return to the office. 

In a conference call this week, senior executives outlined plans to get JPMorgan's top managers in sales and trading back to their desks in London's Canary Wharf and Manhattan in New York.

The move will be a relief for local companies, which rely on commuter trade and have been starved of income for months. 

Most of JPMorgan's 12,000 London staff have been holed up in their homes since the end of March, due to Covid-19. 

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urging firms to get back to their offices, as fears mount for jobs at inner-city shops, cafes, restaurants and bars. 

Bosses at the investment bank also believe having staff in the office will strengthen its culture, allow them to work more efficiently, and is important for training.
