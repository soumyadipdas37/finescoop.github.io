Kevin Campbell and David Alexander were again nominated for eviction on Sunday's episode of Big Brother: All-Stars on CBS.

Cody Calafiore, 29, after winning the Head of Household competition for the second time nominated Kevin, 40, and David, 30, for eviction.

It was the fifth time in eight weeks that Kevin had been nominated for eviction and the third time for David.

'I've been here before in this house and in life, in general, where you're kind of backed into a corner and you really have no recourse, but to rely solely on yourself,' said openly gay Kevin, who finished in third place on Big Brother 11 in 2009.

'There's no more stress of who to talk to, how to talk to these people. It comes down to me winning veto. It all falls in my own hands and I trust my hands, not these houseguests,' he added.

David also was resolved to stay in the game and the Los Angeles resident likened his situation to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, 35, who led the Cleveland Cavaliers to a historic comeback en route to winning the 2016 NBA championship over the Golden State Warriors.

'Being nominated the third time means my comeback starts now. LeBron was down 3-1 in the NBA Finals before he made the biggest comeback in NBA history. I'm going to win veto, I'm going to wear it everyday, I'm going to take a shower in it. I'm going to shine it in everybody's faces. I'm going to pull myself off the block. I'm going to celebrate a championship moment. Oh, veto!,' David said.

The season 22 episode opened on Day 51 with nine houseguests remaining in the competition for the $500,000 grand prize.

The houseguests were still considering the addition of new 'neighbor' Will Kirby, 47, who won Big Brother 2 in 2001.

Dr. Will informed the houseguests that they would have the option in competitions to compete for power and prizes.

Daniele 'Dani' Donato, 34, debated using her Replay power that would allow reigning HoH Robert 'Memphis' Garrett, 37, to compete in the HoH competition.

She discussed it with fellow The Committee alliance member Nicole Franzel, 28, who won Big Brother 18 after finishing in seventh place on Big Brother 16.

Nicole urged Dani to use the power to decrease the odds of Kevin winning HoH and later told Cody about Dani's  reluctance to use her power.

'It's absurd,' Cody told Nicole about Dani's stance.

Dani then approached Memphis and said she wanted to use the power on him.

'I don't want to have anything to do with this idea,' Memphis admitted in a confessional. 'I'm sitting pretty in this house. I just came off HoH. It's a big responsibility. I just want to blend into the carpet right now'.

Dani decided to use the Replay power and outgoing Memphis was allowed to compete for HoH again.

The Head of Household competition was based on a miniature golf game with houseguest given the option of going for power or a $10,000 prize.

'We have gold bars on one side, a shiny HoH key on the other side and I'm pumped. I like both of those things,' said Tyler Crispen, 25.

The houseguests had three balls to putt and could keep their score or take another shot and also could take a shot on both greens.

Memphis tanked the game and gave himself a higher score on purpose to lose. 

Tyler and Dani tied for the low score of three on the money green and secretly shared $5,000 each.

Cody had a fairly low score of six on the power green and decided to take a second shot to improve his score and got the lowest score of two.

Kevin fought back tears in a confessional as he realized he had another 'hard week' ahead with Cody as Head of Household.

Vincenzo 'Enzo' Palumbo, 42, was thrilled that his alliance member Cody won the HoH.

'That's my guy. I've been rocking with him since day one,' said Enzo, who also admitted that he wanted to see Cody get his hands dirty a little more.

Cody entertained a revolving door of houseguests including Dani who urged Cody to take a shot at their The Committee alliance member Christmas Abbott, 38.

Enzo then met with Cody who revealed in a confessional that he was planning on nominating Kevin and David, since they were the only two left in the house that were not part of any of his alliances.

Cody also learned from Enzo about Christms being in a secret final three alliance with Memphis who had two end-game Wise Guys alliances.  

The new HoH later told Nicole that he planned to nominate Kevin and David with Christmas as a replacement nominee if Kevin comes down.

'That's so stupid. You're doing all of Dani's dirty work,' Nicole told him.

Cody stuck with his strategy saying it would benefit his game the most.

Kevin dreaded talking to Cody and admitted that he couldn't stand him.

'I want to talk to Cody as much as I want to stab myself in the eyeballs,' Kevin said.

He then threatened Cody that he wouldn't vote for him if he was in the jury, if he nominated him.

Their conversation took a turn and Cody accused him of making 'digs' at him.

Cody then nominated Kevin and David for eviction.

Big Brother: All-Stars will return Wednesday on CBS and the OTEV musical chairs-style competition will be back to determine who gets the Power of Veto.
