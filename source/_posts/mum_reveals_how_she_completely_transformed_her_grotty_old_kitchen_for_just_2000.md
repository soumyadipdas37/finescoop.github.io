A mother has revealed how she transformed her 'grotty old' kitchen into a luxurious modern space in two months, and the entire DIY project set her back just $2,000.

Australian woman Jennifer Jones said she and her partner spent 'two months with breaks' putting together their new kitchen using items from Bunnings Warehouse.

And while it was a lot of effort, the rewards have more than outweighed the blood, sweat and tears.

'We finally completed our kitchen renovation, and the best part is that we have managed to do that for just under $2k and all ourselves,' Jennifer posted on Facebook. 

'A real cheapy, but we put in a lot of love.'

The average cost of a kitchen renovation in Australia in 2020 is $17,000, meaning the Jones family saved at least $15,000 by doing it all themselves.

Jennifer wrote: 'I won't lie, we are not DIY beginners, but putting in the bench top from joiners to cutting out the sink and stove wasn't a picnic and we were definitely over it by the end of it'.

'But it was all worth it,' she added.

In the kitchen, the mum said she first of all tackled her cabinetry, which can often make a kitchen look instantly better or worse.

'I used Taubmans 3-in-1 primer and painted one coat of it,' Jennifer wrote.

'Then, we covered this with two coats of Dulux's Aquanamel Gloss and added silver knobs to the cabinetry.'

Jennifer and her partner followed this by tackling the tiles on their splashbacks.

'We used White Knights paint from Bunnings on the tiles,' she said.

'One coat of the primer and two coats of the white completely transformed it.'

The walls were also all about painting, with the mum using the Taubmans 3-in-1 primer and 8-in-1 paint in the shade 'Still Here'.

When it came to the bulk of the spending, the Jones family said they spent it on their benchtops.

Jennifer bought new benchtops from Bunnings, the Victorian Ash range, for $435 and $641.

'We painted the benchtop with Cabots Stain Tint Base in Sutherland Teak stain and did two coats,' Jennifer said.

'We then did three coats of the Satin benchtop paint by Cabots.'

The final thing she said she did was replace the sink with a new one - the Blanco - from Bunnings. 

This costs $182 in total.
