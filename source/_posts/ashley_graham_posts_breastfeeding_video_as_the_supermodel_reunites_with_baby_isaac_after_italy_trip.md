The brief video snippets, shared to Ashley's Instagram Story, showed the tot suckling away, first from an overhead angle.

The second clip was an extreme closeup of the baby's lips on his mom's nipple, alongside a caption in which the in-demand runway queen explained her strategy to make sure little Isaac didn't go hungry in her absence.

'Reunited after four days!!' she exclaimed.

'I pumped almost every 3 to 4 hours to keep my supply up while I was in Italy,' Ashley continued. 'I had so much breast milk in the freezer so I didn’t have to worry if Isaac was going to have enough food while I was gone.'
