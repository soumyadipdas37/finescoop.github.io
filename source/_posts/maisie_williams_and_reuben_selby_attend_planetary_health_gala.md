She's been known for her funky style choices.

And Game Of Thrones' Maisie Williams certainly turned heads with her new blonde mullet as she walked the blue carpet at the 2020 Monte Carlo Gala for Planetary Health on Thursday.

The actress, 23, opted for an eye-catching dress with a sheer embroidered skirt and a velvet top as she joined boyfriend Reuben Selby for the event.

Maisie showed off her new hairstyle mere days after unveiling the look on Instagram, having ditched her brunette bob in favour of a choppy blonde mullet.

The Two Weeks To Live star made an impact on the blue carpet in a velvet top and sheer skirt with beaded and embroidered detailing. 

Sporting a matching face mask, Maisie cosied up to her hunky beau Reuben - who she's been dating since last year - in a sharp black and white checked suit as they arrived for the charity gala.

Hosted by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the annual event gathers leading philanthropists, talents and scientists to join forces and launch the charity's initiatives to bridge the widening gap between health and the environment. 

The 2020 Monte-Carlo Gala for Planetary Health aims to highlight the idea that our future is dependent on healthy ecosystems.

Hosted by the Prince’s foundation, it has gathered talents, philanthropists, decision makers and scientists to discuss the challenges the planet’s environment faces.

The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.

Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.  

However it's likely this year's event has seen drastic changes to ensure social distancing can be adhered to, with many stars also donning masks as they arrived on the blue carpet.
