Daniel Andrews let it slip that Victoria's restrictions could be eased even quicker than he set out in the state's 'roadmap to recovery'. 

As the crucial 14-day average for new cases dropped below 30 for Melbourne, the Premier was asked if the government might go further than planned on Sunday, when any relaxing of restrictions are set to be announced.

'Yes, I am. But I'm not in a position to give you the full list of what we're looking at,' Mr Andrews replied at Wednesday's press conference.

Victoria reported another five coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, taking the state toll to 771 and the national figure to 859, as new cases dropped to 15.

The 14-day new case average for Melbourne also dropped below 30 to 29.4, while it is down to 1.1 for regional areas.

There was also good news on cases with an unknown source over 14 days, with that figure dropping to 41 in Melbourne.

There are none in regional Victoria.

Authorities want Melbourne's new case average between 30 and 50 before they consider easing restrictions next Monday, with an announcement expected on Sunday.

Some Melbourne measures were eased on September 14.

Under the government roadmap's September 28 changes announced earlier this month, public gatherings would be allowed for five people from two households.

Schools, childcare and some workplaces would open, along with outdoor pools, while personal trainers could operate with two clients.

There could be outdoor religious services for up to five people, plus a leader. 

Mr Andrews also clarified rules around Melbourne residents who worked in regional areas, given the difference in coronavirus restrictions.

They must have a valid worker's permit and they must comply with Melbourne's stricter measures.

For example, a Melbourne worker cannot go to a regional restaurant for a meal. 

Meanwhile, Australians will soon be able to move around more freely as state borders open up and Victorian restrictions ease earlier than planned.

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt is hopeful greater freedoms will deliver a psychological boost.

'We've seen very significant reports about the lockdown implications of mental health,' Mr Hunt told the ABC.

'We want to give Australians back the best mental health conditions, the best ability to get their lives back, but in a COVID-safe way.' 

Mr Hunt wants sole traders such as gardeners and maintenance staff allowed back to work as the premier speeds up his road to recovery.

'These are critical steps forward,' he said.

'We'd like the roadmap to be accelerated as quickly as is safely possible.'

Tasmania is considering opening its borders to some states before the end of October

NSW recorded six new cases, all of whom were returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine.

There are only five active coronavirus remaining in Queensland, with no new infections recorded overnight.

Queensland has added five more northern NSW councils to its border bubble, while South Australia is also reopening to NSW after lifting restrictions for the ACT.

The Northern Territory is offering interstate travellers up to $1,000 to visit the Top End during the wet season.

Tasmania is considering opening its borders to some states before the end of October.

Despite travel restrictions easing in many parts of the country, Western Australia is maintaining its hardline stance.

Premier Mark McGowan is adamant the border won't reopen until NSW and Victoria go 28 days without community transmission.

'Keeping COVID out, having a hard border and getting our economy back up and functional within the borders is working,' he said.
