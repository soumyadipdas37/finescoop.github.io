Luis Suarez has phoned Giorgio Chiellini in a bid to clear the air as the Barcelona striker edges closer to a move to Juventus.

The Uruguay international infamously bit the Serie A defender on the shoulder during his side's World Cup group stage game against Italy in Brazil in 2014. 

Suarez was not sent off that day as the referee did not see it but was later banned from football for four months.

Now he has spoken to Chiellini as he aims to put the incident behind them and move on as potential team-mates according to Gazzetta dello Sport.   

Despite the savage nature of Suarez's chomp, Chiellini has since shrugged off the incident.

He said: 'Suddenly I noticed he had bit my shoulder.

'It just happened, but this is his contact strategy in hand-to-hand combat and, if I may say so, it is mine too.

'He and I are similar.'

Suarez also took responsibility for his actions at the time so a meeting between the two in the coming weeks should not be too awkward.

Suarez said: 'I admit I was wrong, but I am a human being.

'Each player has his own style of play, his own character and this got me where I am now.' 

Juventus are set to land Suarez in a deal worth just £4.4million as Barcelona continue their summer clear out under new boss Ronald Koeman.

At 33-years-old, Barca are keen to move on the striker in a bid to ease their wage bill and Juventus are hopeful a cut-price deal for the former Liverpool hitman can be done within the next three weeks in time for the start of the new Serie A campaign.

According to Sky Sports Italia, Juventus are hoping that with Suarez in their side they could field one of the best front three in Europe alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Paulo Dybala.

Juventus have excellent relations with Barcelona and are confident an agreement for Suarez's move to the Allianz Stadium can be arranged swiftly.

Suarez has already agreed a three-year-deal with Juve worth around £9million-a-year with bonus clauses to be added.

However, the deal could be held up by Suarez's financial demands from the Nou Camp outfit in relation to the move.

It is understood the Uruguay hitman is demanding £22m in severance pay and is not willing to negotiate lowering his request.

Suarez's contract at the Nou Camp expires next summer having joined them six years ago from Liverpool.
