Filip Krovinovic has competed his return to West Bromwich Albion after putting pen to paper on a season-long loan deal. 

The Benfica midfielder played a key role in the Baggies' promotion-winning campaign, making 43 appearances as Slaven Bilic's side finished the season as Championship runners-up. 

Bilic had been desperate to get his fellow Croatian back at the club and revealed that he would walk into training every day demanding updates on Krovinovic's return.

The former Croatia Under-21 international is now back at The Hawthorns, after West Brom completed protracted negotiations with his Portuguese parent club.

Bilic's Baggies finally got their season up and running in their third match of the campaign, scrambling a chaotic 3-3 draw with Chelsea on Saturday after crushing defeats by Leicester and Everton.

Krovinovic likened his return to the west Midlands to a family reunion.

'It's an absolute pleasure to be back with family,' he said. 'I know it took a little bit of time but now I'm here and that's the most important thing.

'I said to my brother that it's like coming back to school after the summer holidays. To see your friends is one of the best things in your life.'
