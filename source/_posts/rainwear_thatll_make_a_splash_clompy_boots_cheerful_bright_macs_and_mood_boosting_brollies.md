What do you think the biggest footwear trend is for autumn 2020? Go on, have a guess.

Heels? Hardly. Platforms? Think again. Thigh-high boots? Miles off. It’s wellies. Yes, really.

The autumn/winter catwalk shows were a festival (and we use the word advisedly) of rubberised, tractor-soled boots in all manner of heights, shapes and colours. While a few of these luxe wellies are rather impractical (Versace’s high-heeled design springs to mind); most of the styles are very wearable.

British style expert Anna Pursglove, shared her advice for style throughout autumn and winter. Pictured: Coat, £59.90, uniqlo.com; knit, £156, whistles.com; skirt, £39, and boots, £89, topshop.com; bag, £115, hunterboots.com

Coat, £150, dress, £34.50, and bag, £59, cosstores. com; roll-neck, £26.97, gap. co.uk (worn throughout); boots, £148, whistles.com; hat, £3, topshop.com

The price tags may prove a puddle too far. Bottega Veneta’s Tire boots, for example, won’t leave you a lot of change from £900. But, luckily, the High Street has jumped straight on to this trend.

The Alonzo black and red boots at Topshop (third from right), for instance, bear more than a passing resemblance to the aforementioned Tire boots, but are a tenth of the price.

Ever since Kate Moss strolled into Glastonbury in 2005 wearing Hunter wellies with tiny shorts and a waistcoat, fashion has been in love with the British brand and, in particular, that tall style (hunter boots.com, £95). And now they come in just about any colour you can think of.

Hiking boots are also proving popular. If you can’t afford designer brands such as Penelope Chilvers and Grenson, try the insulated commando ones from Hunter (£125) or the Amber lace-up pair from Whistles (second from left).

Happily raincoats are also a ‘thing’ this season. (In our household, they’re never not a ‘thing’, but that’s fashion for you.) Trench coats are big for autumn, both literally and metaphorically. I love the oversized gingham design (third from right) from Alexa Chung’s Barbour range. If you want something less voluminous, then try Topshop’s vinyl shacket (third from left).

With the big ticket items sorted, you might want to invest in some accessories, such as a bucket hat. It’s a divisive item, and many would rather stick with a trusty umbrella. However, do consider that Topshop’s check hat (second from left) won’t get forgotten at the door of a cafe, will fit in your pocket, and is unlikely to take an eye out in a gale.

When it comes to weather-proofed bags, meanwhile, have a look at Cos’s quilted oversized bag (second from left).

What with everyone staycationing and socialising outdoors due to Covid, I’m grateful for these useful trends. You could call it the perfect fashion storm.
