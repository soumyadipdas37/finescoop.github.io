Ryan Fredericks insists West Ham can pick up points from their nightmare run of fixtures despite their woeful start to the season.

The Hammers already look like a club destined to struggle after opening their Premier League campaign with a 2-0 home defeat by Newcastle.

The fixture list has not been kind to manager David Moyes with Arsenal, Wolves, Leicester, Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool all to come before October is out.

But right-back Fredericks told the club website: 'I think we're a team who it doesn't matter who we're playing against, it's more about us on the day.

'We did well against some of the top six and top eight teams last season and I'm sure we'll do it again.

'We ended last season well, we were flying, and we've come back and we've been training well and training hard and trying to do the same things, but Saturday definitely wasn't good enough.

'We had the exactly same team that went and dominated most games at the back end of last season, even when we were playing some of the top teams in the league, but we just weren't at it.

West Ham are preparing for their Carabao Cup clash against Charlton on Tuesday night

The Carabao Cup fixture should offer the Hammers some respite following a turbulent summer

'It's game one of a long season, so we're not going to get too down.'

League One Charlton should offer some respite when they visit the London Stadium in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night.

Moyes said he will give 'opportunities' to other players so Darren Randolph is set to start in goal against the club where he started his career.

Midfielder Josh Cullen, who spent last season on loan at The Valley, is expected to be involved along with the likes of Robert Snodgrass and Jack Wilshere, who were missing from the squad against Newcastle.
