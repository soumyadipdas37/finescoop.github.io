Ella Eyre has spoken candidly about sex and relationships on the new series of Badoo's dating podcast The Truth Flirts. 

The songstress, 26, spoke on episode one of the show about breaking down the taboos about women, sexual pleasure and misrepresentations in porn. 

She said: 'It's so important that we break down the taboo that surrounds female pleasure. Women enjoy sex and have the right to do so. From misrepresentations in porn, to education, girls are growing up not understanding their sexual worth'.

Speaking about faking orgasms, Ella said: 'I feel like there's a fear around being honest about it, because, as I grew up, if you fancied a boy, but you weren't quite sure if that was good, or you didn't really know, you didn't want to talk about it...

'[That's] out of fear they wouldn't fancy you anymore and wouldn't want to do it anymore. I think as I've got older, actually the more I've spoken about it, the more receptive guys have been, because they want to know, they want to learn... 

'Not all of them (and they should), but most of them really want to make sure that you're having a good time, and I think that's a really sexy quality in a man when they show interest in your enjoyment too'.

On sexual pleasure in women, she went on: 'It's so important that we break down the taboo that surrounds female pleasure – women don't often talk about it publicly but it's important to educate, discuss and share our experiences...

'Once you start to talk, you realise how much you have in common and it really helps remove any shame or embarrassment.'

Speaking about The Truth Flirts, which is released next Monday, she said: 'I'm about to launch Season 2 of dating app Badoo's brutally honest content series, The Truth Flirts. It's been so much fun to get involved this year, and I learnt so much from every guest we had on...

'What I love about Badoo is that it's the place to date honestly and be totally unfiltered. In the series, I wanted to tackle head on some of the issues young people face when dating...

Here come the girls: She was chatting to Megan Barton Hanson 

'There are certain subjects we tend to only talk about with our friends behind closed doors, but I believe everyone can benefit from hearing what our guests had to say on each topic...

'On The Truth Flirts, I'm joined by loads of well-known faces. We've got Derry Girls' Saoirse-Monica Jackson, television personality Lateysha Grace, comedian Chunkz, reality stars Vas J Morgan and Megan Barton-Hanson and Rudimental's Amir Amor to name a few! 

'We get into everything from gender labels and the orgasm gap, to Mercury retrograde and of course, how Coronavirus has impacted our dating lives. 

Here she is: 'Once you start to talk, you realise how much you have in common and it really helps remove any shame or embarrassment'

Natasha Briefel, UK Brand Marketing Director at Badoo added: 'Badoo is all about dating honestly, and after the success of last year's debut season of The Truth Flirts, with host Mel B, we wanted to continue breaking down taboos when it comes to dating and relationships by speaking openly about the highs and lows of modern dating in way that's real and relatable. 

'With Ella Eyre as the new host and having truly knowledgeable guests alongside her, we want to show there is no reason to hide away from the things that make you who you are...

'The Truth Flirts aims to be a platform for brutally honest conversations to encourage others to do the same in their dating lives, which is exactly what Badoo is all about!' 

Breaking taboo! She was rallying to fellow females
