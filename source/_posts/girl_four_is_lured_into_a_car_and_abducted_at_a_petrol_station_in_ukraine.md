'At the gas station in Boryspil, an unknown man, taking advantage of the fact that the mother was distracted from her daughter, paying for fuel, kidnapped the girl, put her in a car and drove in an unknown direction,' a press release from the National Police of Ukraine said. 

The girl's father was also nearby, a witness added.  

'Dad was in the car, mum went to the gas station with her, and while mum was standing at the checkout, the girl was looking at toys,' the witness told local media outlet Gazeta.

After her parents reported the abduction, police mobilised all available officers, including CID detectives, to track down the youngster.
