The New York City jogger who was attacked by a 'Karen' who threw a glass bottle at her and called her the n-word says she was the victim of a hate crime and is demanding justice. 

Tiffany Johnson, 37, was on a run at 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens around noon on August 17 when she passed a corner and a woman threw a glass bottle at her feet unprovoked.

The woman shouted, 'Get out of here n*****, go back to Africa,' according to video release by the NYPD on Wednesday.

'It’s a hate crime. It’s not acceptable. She has to be [held] responsible for her behavior,' Johnson said to the New York Post.

New York City jogger Tiffany Johnson, 37, who was harassed by a 'Karen' who threw a glass bottle at her and called her the n-word on August 17 is speaking out and says she was victim of a hate crime

The August 17 attack was caught on video. The suspect behind the attack pictured above sipping from a glass bottle at the corner of 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens

As Johnson approached the corner the suspect suddenly threw the bottle at her feet and yelled 'Go back to Africa, n****r', police say 

The woman threw the glass bottle and it shattered on the ground near the jogger's foot 

Johnson revealed she thought the woman had mistaken her for someone else, and didn't initially think the attack was racially motivated.

But once the woman started to scream hateful insults at her, she realized it was because she is black.

'She could see the color of my skin and she reacted to that,' Johnson said.

'I was definitely shocked. I was surprised but more importantly I wanted to get away from her,' she added.

In the clip Johnson is seen turning back confused and saying 'What is your problem?' when the woman berates her and then continues her run.

The suspect then repeatedly screamed 'Get out, Go back to Africa, n****r!'. Johnson looked back and said, 'What is your problem?' before continuing her run

'I’m entitled to go for a job, live my life, enjoy my life and enjoy the things that makes me happy,' she said.

Johnson said she took the route of being the bigger person and leaving rather than arguing with the woman.

'That’s not on me. That’s a reflection on her. She needs to look at herself and figure out why she looks down on somebody,' she said.

'We are always trying to give reasons for what people do but I can’t get into her head. I only know what she did, what she said and her actions,' she added.

Johnson revealed she is happy police are on the hunt for her attacker – a woman described as light-skinned in her 40s who appears to have a foreign accent.

She is described as 5'5", has blue eyes, long blonde hair and was wearing a black tank top, white shorts, and dark sunglasses

'I’m glad the video surfaced so, hopefully, she won’t do this to someone else. People shouldn’t have to deal with that type of behavior,' Johnson said.

'I refused to and that’s why I walked away – nope, nope!' she added. 

Johnson did not report the incident at the time until a friend saw the witness video on social media. 

She told ABC7 she has not gone back to that neighborhood since the incident, but has received an outpouring of support from groups like Black Girls Run.
