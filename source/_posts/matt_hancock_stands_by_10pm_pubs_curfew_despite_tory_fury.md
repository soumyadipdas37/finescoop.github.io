Matt Hancock stood by the 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants today despite anger that it is making things worse.

The Health Secretary was repeatedly challenged by Tories on the swingeing restrictions as he announced new lockdown measures in the North West.

But he sidestepped demands for the scientific basis behind the curb, and dismissed concerns that forcing venues to shut is merely fuelling revelry on the streets and house parties. 

Denying he was taking an axe to civil liberties, Mr Hancock warned that letting the virus 'rip' would mean 'hundreds of thousands of deaths' - although that appears to be significantly more even than the chilling estimates from medical and science advisers Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. 

Anger has been growing about the restriction, amid fears that it could kill off swathes of the industry and destroy thousands of jobs.

Conservative former Cabinet minister Greg Clark asked in the Commons: 'It does seem strange to think that concentrating trade in a smaller number of hours and making everyone leave a pub or a restaurant at the same time rather than spacing them out over the course of the evening should suppress rather than spread the virus.'

Mr Hancock replied: 'The scientific advice is that the people who are closer together are more likely to spread the virus, and later at night social distancing becomes harder.

'We've all seen the pictures of people leaving pubs at 10 o'clock but otherwise they would have been inside the establishments and we all know that outside is safer, or they'd be leaving later.

'Of course, we keep this under review and of course we're constantly looking at how we can improve these policies, but I think we've got to look at both sides of the evidence to try to get this right.'

Tory backbencher Philip Davies accused Mr Hancock of presiding over a 'nanny state' with the imposed 10pm curfew policy and called on him to 'start acting like a Conservative'.

Mr Davies said: 'Is the Secretary of State aware of the damage the arbitrary 10pm curfew is doing to pubs, restaurants, bowling alleys and casinos? Is he aware of the jobs that are being lost, all just to see people congregating on the streets instead and shop staff getting more abuse?

'When will the Secretary of State start acting like a Conservative with a belief in individual responsibility and abandon this arbitrary, nanny state, socialist approach which is serving no purpose at all apart from the further collapse of the economy and erode our freedoms?'

But Mr Hancock said he 'profoundly' disagreed with Mr Davies, saying he believed in 'individual responsibility and the promotion of freedom, subject to not harming others'.

He added: 'So it is perfectly reasonable to make the argument that we should just let the virus rip, I just think that the hundreds of thousands of deaths that would follow is not a price that anyone should pay.'
