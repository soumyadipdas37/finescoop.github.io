She's arguably the most controversial star on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. 

But Brandi Glanville has now hinted that she could swap her glamorous life in Los Angeles for Australia one day.

During an episode of her podcast Brandi Glanville Unfiltered, the 47-year-old said: 'I want to be Aussie! I really want to. I just want to move there.'

'I just want to move there!' Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville says she wants to relocate to Australia one day 

She added: 'I've only been there once, but I feel in love. Everyone there is hot! Like every single person.' 

Brandi also called herself an 'honorary Aussie' and said that her gay Australian friends in California 'don't judge me for my drinking'.

However, the reality star admitted that her last visit Down Under came with its fair share of drama, as she was 'almost arrested' during a night out.

'I almost got arrested, but the police ended up carrying me to my room which was so awesome,' she laughed.

Brandi's been open about her love of Aussie men, and she recently set her sights on Love Island Australia's hunky twin brothers, Josh and Luke Packham, who are 26. 

Last week, she tweeted out a shirtless photo of the handsome siblings with a heart emoji. 

When contacted for comment, Josh told Daily Mail Australia that his girlfriend and co-star Anna McEvoy made him aware of the flirty tweet. 

'Anna sent it to me and I wasn't sure who it was at first, but it's pretty cool that Americans are watching the show and seem to be enjoying it,' he said. 

Keen? Brandi's been open about her love of Aussie men, and she recently set her sights on Love Island Australia's hunky twin brothers, Luke and Josh Packham, who are 26

Luke seemed more open to the idea, saying: 'I thought it was fun seeing Brandi's Twitter with our photo on it. If I didn't have a girlfriend I could imagine myself in a nice mansion in Beverly Hills!' 

Josh and Anna were crowned the winners of Love Island Australia's second season last year.

The couple have been going strong ever since and officially moved in together back in early June.

Luke has also found love since the show, although he's kept his relationship out of the spotlight.

Meanwhile, Brandi has been single since her highly publicised fling with Denise Richards was featured on the latest season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. 

'I've only been there once, but I feel in love. Everyone there is hot! Like every single person,' Brandi said of Australia
