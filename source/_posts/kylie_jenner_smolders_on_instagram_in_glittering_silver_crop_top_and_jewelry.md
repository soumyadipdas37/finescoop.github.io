Kylie Jenner smoldered on her Instagram page this Thursday as she posted a couple of glamorous backyard snapshots.

In the mood for a bit more jewelry she clasped on a bracelet and a couple of rings as part of her clubby ensemble.

Kylie slipped into a pair of high-waisted jeans and wore a sleek deep brown hairdo for her latest sizzling Instagram pictures.

The reality TV star, who shares her two-year-old daughter Stormi with her friendly ex Travis Scott, captioned: 'you call?'

Her busty album comes the day after she was spotted emerging from a Tik Tok party at the West Hollywood nightclub 40 Love.

She also put up the post on the heels of an announcement that Keeping Up With The Kardashians is coming to an end.

Kylie became a star by way of the reality show, which aired its pilot episode in October 2007 when she was only 10 years old.

Although there were rumors that she and her older half-sisters Kourtney and Kim Kardashian pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.

The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.

Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'

To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.

During its run Keeping Up With The Kardashians sprouted several spin-offs including Life Of Kylie which ran only one season in 2017.
