Their romance has proved to be one of the showbiz world's most enduring marriages, having celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary in January.

And Michael Caine, 87, and his glamorous wife Shakira, 73, looked as loved-up as ever on Thursday night, when they stepped out for a romantic meal in London.

Cutting a dapper figure in a navy suit, the legendary screen star held hands with his stunning spouse as they made their exit from the upscale Oswald's Club.

Teaming his smart suit with a powder blue shirt, the Harry Brown star used a walking stick as he made his way to a cab ahead of being whisked off home.

Looking as captivating as ever, Shakira stepped outin a shimmering midnight green dress, which she teamed with a beaded necklace and black glittering handbag.

Rounding out her chic ensemble with a pair of black heels with opaque tights, Guyanese-born beauty added further sparkle with diamond drop earrings.

Former British Army solider Caine has been walking with the aid of a stick since a nasty fall on a patch of ice in 2018, leaving him with an ankle injury.

'Michael slipped and broke his ankle in his garden during the recent heavy snow,' his spokesperson told The Mirror at the time. 'He is in fine health and great spirits.'

Last year, the veteran British actor revealed how he met the love of his life after seeing her star in a coffee commercial.

'I was at home and this commercial came on, for Maxwell House coffee. And there was this beautiful Brazilian girl,' he told Andrew Denton's Interview.

'I said to my mate "we're going to Brazil tomorrow - I have plenty of money, we're going to find her".'

Much to the actor's surprise, though, was the fact his dream woman was not on the other side of the world but instead a stone's throw away from where he was living.

'I got all excited and said let's go down to the tavern to have a drink and this other guy comes in. He said "we made that commercial - she's not in Brazil, she's on the Fulham Road" which is about a mile away from me.'

Michael called his future bride 11 times before she agreed to go out with him.

Michael married Shakira in 1973 and they have one daughter together, Natasha, 47. He has another daughter Nikki, 63, from his previous marriage with actress Patricia Haines.
