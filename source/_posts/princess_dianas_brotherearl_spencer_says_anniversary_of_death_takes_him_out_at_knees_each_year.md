Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer has said he is 'always surprised by how difficult' the anniversary of her death remains as he revealed it continues to 'take him out at knees.' 

Charles Spencer, 55, who lives at Althorp House, his family seat in the Northamptonshire countryside, appeared on Radio 4 today where he discussed the late princess' death and touched on his grief. 

He explained: 'I'm always surprised by how difficult August 31 is each year actually. I always slightly brace myself for it and it does take me out at the knees. It is a very poignant time.'

Princess Diana died at the age of 36 when the car she was travelling in crashed in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997, with this year marking the 23rd anniversary of her death.

Discussing his loss on today's programme, he said: 'Everyone's personal loss is so intensely personal. And 23 years ago, it was very much a public outpouring.'

Diana is buried on an island in the grounds of Althorp House,  her childhood home where Charles continues to live.  

Earl Spencer explained: 'I row over to the island and spend time there. It's very odd when you lose someone very close.'

He added: 'There are holes in every family that can't be filled.'

Elsewhere in the interview, he recalled grappling with his sister's fame as a youngster, explaining: 'I remember when she got engaged and suddenly realising this girl I'd grown up with was world famous.'

'I remember my first reaction to the extreme level of global fame was always having an ache listening to the news. 

'I thought if something ever happened to her, It would be the first item on the news. Even as a teenager I was conscious it would be the top bulletin.'

After being asked if he had heard of her death through the news, he recalled: 'I was on the phone to my other sister Jane and her husband worked for the Queen and he was on another line.

The Earl said he 'braced' each year ahead of the anniversary of the late royal's death, but said it remained 'a very difficult and poignant time' (pictured alongside Prince William, Prince Harry and Prince Charles at Princess Diana's funeral)

'I heard him go "Oh no," and that's when I knew.'

Last month, Charles shared several touching tributes to the late royal as he marked the date of her death.

He posted a snapshot of the flag flying half-mast at his home on Twitter, writing: 'My first family duty on 31 August. Never forgotten.'

It comes after Charles shared several touching tributes to the late royal as he marked the date of her death (pictured left, the flag flying half mast at Althorp House, and right, a bench adorned with flowers) 

Meanwhile he went on to share a second picture of a bench adorned with bouquets of flowers and thanked well-wishers for their support. 

Sharing an image of a bench on the estate, he wrote: 'Lovely flowers from all sorts of kind people today, and recently, at Althorp House. Thanks to all of them.'    

It was recently revealed plans for a statue that was commissioned to mark the twentieth anniversary of Princess Diana's death will now be installed at Kensington Palace next year. 

It comes after the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge announced a statue is to be installed in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace to mark what would have been her 60th birthday (Princess Diana with her sons Prince William and Prince Harry at Wetherby School on September 12, 1989 in London)

A statement on behalf of the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge issued by Kensington Palace read: 'The statue that Prince William and Prince Harry have commissioned to commemorate their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, will be installed next year on what would have been her 60th birthday.'  

It will be installed in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace on 1st July 2021, marking The Princess's 60th birthday.

The brothers announced the commission of the statue two years ago on the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death.
