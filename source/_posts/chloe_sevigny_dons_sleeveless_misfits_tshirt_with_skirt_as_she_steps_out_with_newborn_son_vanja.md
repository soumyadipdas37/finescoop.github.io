New parents: Chloë and the gallery director began dating back in 2018, and the couple welcomed their first child in early May

Chloë and the gallery director began dating back in 2018, and the couple welcomed their first child in early May. 

Although she appeared to be enjoying the outing, she recently admitted to W Magazine that going out these days makes her anxious.

The American Psycho actress said: 'I would say that my neuroses around that have really amped up because of the small child and my mother. I guess it’s not even neuroses at this point, it’s just what everybody is doing. It’s common.'

She added: 'I’m walking around a lot, I like to push him around in the stroller, and a lot of people walk by shouting without masks on.

'Like, just put it on! Is it that hard? I know it’s hot and that’s miserable, but bring an extra one so you can change, or don’t shout.'

Chloë also plays a mother in her latest project, the new Luca Guadagnino HBO show We Are Who We Are, which premiered earlier this month.

Onscreen son: She also explained how costar Jack Dylan Grazer, 17, who plays her onscreen son Fraser, helped her warm up to the idea of having a boy: 'I'd always secretly desired a girl'

She revealed that while filming the series in Italy, she kept her pregnancy a secret from the cast and crew.

The veteran 'it' girl said: 'It was a little awkward. I love going out with the crew and the cast and having drinks, but I was very tired all the time. I wasn’t so sick, but I did have other, hormonal side effects. Navigating that was tricky.'

She also explained how costar Jack Dylan Grazer, 17, who plays her onscreen son Fraser, helped her warm up to the idea of having a boy.

The Boys Don't Cry actress old WSJ Magazine: 'I'd always secretly desired a girl. I guess that's not a secret if I'm talking about it to WSJ. But I'm very girl-power, girl-friendly, girl-centric. I don't even have that many male friends unless I'd slept with them or whatever.'  

She continued: 'But on set I kept thinking, "What if I have a kid like this kid Jack?" First of all, he's brilliant, so that would be great; but secondly, he has so much energy. It was a lot of meditating on that one.'

 Chloë stars in the coming-of-age show as Sarah Wilson, a colonel in the military, whose teenage son Fraser begins to explore his identity on an American base in Italy.
