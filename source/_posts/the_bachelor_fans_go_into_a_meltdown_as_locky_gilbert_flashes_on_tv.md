Fans of The Bachelor were left stunned on Thursday night when leading man Locky Gilbert appeared to momentarily flash his private parts.

The bizarre moment happened when the 31-year-old thrill-seeker was enjoying a bubble bath date via Zoom with contestant Izzy Sharman-Firth.

At one stage, he clambered out of the bathtub completely nude and what looked like a fleshly appendage was visible between Locky's legs.

Some viewers at home were convinced the former Australian Survivor star had revealed a lot more than he'd bargained for.

However, upon closer inspection it's clear that Locky did not in fact expose himself.

The body part on show was not Locky's genitalia, but was instead his right hand reaching out to grab the edge of the bathtub.

Eagle-eyed fans at home worked it out by using the live pause function on their TVs and examining the moment frame by frame.

The Bachelor employs a team of editors who make sure that no nudity is shown and that everything is appropriate for prime time.

Locky did not expose himself and nothing inappropriate was shown, contrary to some of the hysteria on social media.

Thursday's episode of The Bachelor marked the first time in the franchise's history that dates took place virtually.

On-site production at the Bachelor mansion in Oxford Falls, Sydney, had been suspended in March due to the escalating coronavirus pandemic.

The entire cast and crew, including Locky and host Osher Günsberg, had to leave the estate in go into self-isolation.

Locky continued dating his contestants in lockdown, and rose ceremonies were held as normal. Filming resumed at the mansion in the first week of July.
