She denied last week that she's become engaged to her boyfriend Louis Bélanger-Martin.

But it's clear that the relationship between Tyra Banks and the businessman is going strong.

On Sunday, the couple were spotted picking up groceries together in LA's Pacific Palisades neighborhood.

The pair, who were first liked romantically a year ago, were seen stopping by a farmer's market before visiting an organic supermarket as they stocked up on supplies.

The model, 46, was dressed down in a black tank top paired with camo pants and jacket.

Banks stepped out in black trainers and had a baseball cap pulled down over her hair.

She added a pair of large sunglasses and wore a cloth face mask.

Couple: Last week, on the Tamron Hall Show, Banks denied she and Bélanger-Martin were engaged after she was snapped with a ring on her left hand ring finger 

Banks, meanwhile, is finding her footing as the new host of Dancing With The Stars, replacing both Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews for season 29 which premiered earlier this month.

Unfortunately, it hasn't been smooth sailing for the star and fans of the long-running celebrity competition series have been vicious about her performance on social media. 

After the season premiere, a majority of the tweets desperately begged for the return of veteran hosts Bergeron and Andrews who were shockingly canned in July.

And following last week's episode, Banks shared a video on TikTok in which she acknowledged she had made some mistakes on the show but had pushed through them.

'Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing with the Stars... and, it wasn't perfect,' the TV host said in the video. 'Yeah, I had a lot of fun but I messed up, I said the wrong words, but the thing is I kept going.' 

Speaking up: Also last week, Banks defended herself as the new host of Dancing With The Stars after facing criticism on Tuesday night's episode and the show's season 29 premiere
