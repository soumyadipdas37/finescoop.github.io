Sebastian Stan is back to work on his latest Marvel project, as Hollywood bounces back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the Romanian-American actor is still taking necessary precautions against the coronavirus at work.

He rocked a sweet blue leather jacket Friday night, as he masked up in a matching blue surgical mask, between takes on the set of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in Atlanta.

The 38-year-old was in character as Bucky Barnes (aka Winter Soldier), the comic book character he originated onscreen in the 2011 blockbuster Captain America: The First Avenger.

His jacket featured only one sleeve, while revealing his character's high-tech prosthetic arm/killing machine. 

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was set to premiere last month on the streaming platform, but it was ultimately postponed to next year, amid the global pandemic.

Stan stars in the upcoming Disney+ miniseries alongside Anthony Mackie, 42, who revives his role as Sam Wilson (aka Falcon).
