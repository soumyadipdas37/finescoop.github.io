Jennifer Lopez has performed on stages for decades.

But she may have received a little bit of help with her performances through the last few years after daughter Emme admitted on the Today Show that she prays for her mom before every show.

The 12-year-old little girl admitted she takes a moment to think positive thoughts for her mom, a ritual which helped inspire her new children's book, Lord Help Me.

'My grandma prayed with me every day when I saw her. My mom would do it too. "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep," you know, that one. That's the one I would say every day,' she said.

Emme revealed that she carried the power of prayer into her every day life and thinks of her mother often when saying her silent affirmations.

'I do pray for my mother,' she said. 'I usually pray before she does her shows and stuff. Because she can get hurt in many ways.'

Not only did Emme sing during the most popular 10 minutes of television at the Super Bowl halftime show, she's also gone on tour with her mom and appeared on stage during Lopez's It's My Party Tour.

'When I was walking to under the stage, where I had to be, it was scary,' she said. 'But when I got up there, everything was fine.'

Lopez gave a few tips to her baby girl before they got on stage in February to perform for millions of people around the world. 

'I told her, listen, there's nothing there except you and that camera with the red light on it. Just look at that red light,' Lopez recalled. 'And she was like, "Okay." And, like you said, she nailed it.'

Another challenge that came easy for the Lopez household was blending two families together when Jennifer began dating Alex Rodriguez.

He has two daughters, Natasha and Ella, from a previous marriage to Cynthia Scurtis which ended in 2008.

Lopez also has a son, Max, with ex-husband Marc Anthony. They ended their relationship in 2011 and were officially divorced in 2014. 

'It was very organic. They just clicked,' she said of the four children together. 'It was just very easy.'
