He moves the can to his mouth to drink from it as the crab loses its grip on the tab and almost attacks Cooper's eye.

Cooper holds the crab out away from him and continues to chug the beer.

Mr Holman's video has been watched more than 212,000 times on the popular social media app and received 8,100 likes.

Viewers commented saying that this is something that would only happen in Australia. 

'Doesn't get much more Aussie than that,' one wrote. 

'Who needs keys or a shotgun tool when you can have someone do it for you,' someone commented.
