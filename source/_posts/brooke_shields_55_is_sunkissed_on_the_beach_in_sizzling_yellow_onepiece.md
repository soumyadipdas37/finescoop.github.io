Brooke Shields, 55, looked impossibly youthful in a 'sunkissed' yellow one-piece swimsuit on the beach in a new Instagram post on Thursday.

The model/actress used her sizzling snap to tease her 1.1 millions fans with a new project on the horizon with fellow model Helena Christensen.

Recently Brooke has been getting back to work amid the coronavirus pandemic and jetted off to Europe to begin filming an upcoming Netflix project.

The mother of two cut a stunning figure as she lounged in the sand in the beachy snap.

Brooke sported a leggy look wearing a lemon yellow one-piece that read 'sunkissed' across the bodice in big white script.

The former Calvin Klein model tossed her long brunette tresses back in the sunshine while the surf crashed over her tanned skin. In the background a large black dog trotted around. 

She captioned the shot: 'Working on something special with my friend @helenachristensen You are incredible. Stay tuned - exciting things to share soon.'

The star gave no hints about what the 'something special' might be and on her page, Helena Christensen, was also quiet about the upcoming collaboration.  

Currently, Shields is pretty far from the shores and is working on a new Netflix film in Europe. 

The Ugly Betty actress took no chances during her transcontinental travels this week.

On Wednesday, she showed off her impressive array of facial coverings, the inspiration for which she attributed to supermodel Naomi Campbell.

'Taking travel tips from @naomi [PLANE EMOJI] On my way across the pond to shoot a @netflix movie!' wrote the mother-of-two.

Accompanying the caption was a photo of the Blue Lagoon stunner in a face shield, N95 face mask and a pair of plastic goggles. Two videos showed the ex-wife of Andre Agassi disinfecting her seat with sanitizing wipes.

Brooke took her cues from 50-year-old supermodel Campbell, who in July took to her own social media to show herself flying in a complete Hazmat suit.

The Blue Lagoon actress is currently partnering with Life Happens - a nonprofit organization promoting life insurance - to bring awareness to parents and people everywhere about the importance of being prepared for the future.

Encouraging people to have these conversations with their family, the actress opened up to her 1M followers on Instagram.

'I’ve made it a priority to strengthen not only my physical health but my financial health as well. September is Life Insurance Awareness Month, and I’m partnering with @lifehappens to share that there’s no better time to get life insurance to stay healthy — mind, body, and finances' she wrote.

In addition to having real time talks with her kids in quarantine, Brooke has spent time hosting themed dinner parties, making TikTok videos and enjoying her family's company on the east coast.

Shields shares two daughters, Rowan, 17, and Grier, 14, with second husband, screenwriter Chris Henchy.
