The Bachelor's Roxi Kenny dramatically stormed out of the mansion on Thursday's episode, after her feud with Juliette Hererra. 

And now the 29-year-old has revealed the real reason she tearfully left the series while speaking to The Courier Mail on Friday.  

'There was something said to me off camera that was the straw that broke the camel's back. It hit below the belt,' Roxi said. 

 'It happened off camera': The Bachelor's Roxi Kenny, 29, has revealed the real reason she stormed out of the mansion on Thursday, amid her feud with co-star Juliette Hererra 

The blonde mechanical engineer decided not to divulge what exactly happened, but spoke of the deep impact it had on her. 

'I don't think it's important that people know what was said, but at the same time it was the one thing that pushed me that far over the edge,' she told the publication. 

Roxi went on to say she was 'disappointed' she let it get to her. 

'It wasn't a good environment for me anymore,' she said. 'Juliette had been poking and prodding me all season. What you saw on the show, that's just a snippet of the stuff I was experiencing.'

Pressure: 'I don't think it's important that people know what was said, but at the same time it was the one thing that pushed me that far over the edge,' she told the publication. Pictured: Juliette Hererra

The revelation comes after dramatic scenes saw Roxi exit the mansion on Thursday. 

During the cocktail party, Roxi and Juliette clashed. 

'I'm not gonna be pushed round. If she's gonna be in this house, I'd rather not be here,' Roxi said of Juliette.

Juliette appeared to see the display as comical. 

'Why would you leave over me? Little old Juliette,' she said. 

Had enough: Roxi certainly didn't leave on good terms 

Locky seemed only too happy to look to the future after the dramatic walk-off. 

'I can't believe Roxi's gone. It sucks. It hurts,' he said.

'[But] As much as it sucks, I have to move forward, because I want to find my forever girl. So today, I'm looking forward to my single date with Bec.'
