The radio and TV star, 31, spoke to the magazine about growing up in Newcastle, raised by a Nigerian mother and a white English father.

While she remembers her childhood fondly and is loyal to her hometown Vick explained: 'In many ways, that affects your confidence, doesn't it?'

'It makes you feel like you're less than, and you know, when people touch your hair without asking it's though you're kind of a novelty or like a pet... it's a bit dehumanising.'

Speaking about the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, the star admitted she often feels deflated by responses from some, explaining: 'So my worry is that there are just some people who will refuse to listen, no matter what.'

'And that makes me scared that I can't ever do enough. But then that shouldn't be a reason to not keep fighting because then if we all felt that, we would never do anything, so we've got to keep going. You've got to keep going in spite of the people who don't want you to' .

Life Hacksfocuses on mental health and ways to improve life in general, with Vick admitting she herself learned so much from the show while growing up.

Tough: While she remembers her childhood fondly and is loyal to her hometown Vick explained: 'In many ways, that affects your confidence, doesn't it?'

'It was called The Surgery at the time, but the Life Hacks show was a very important place for me when I was growing up,' she said.

'I remember so many things that I didn't know how to talk to my teachers or my parents about; those hard questions that I had, they were answered on that show.'

'It was a place to feel like you weren't alone; that whatever you were going through, you have this community. I've found such solace in that show and it's very special to me.'
