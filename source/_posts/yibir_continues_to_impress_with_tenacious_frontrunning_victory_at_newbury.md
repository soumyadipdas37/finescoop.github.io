Yibir is 50-1 for next year’s Derby after a gritty front-running victory in the one-mile Haynes, Hanson & Clark Conditions Stakes at Newbury.

The Charlie Appleby-trained colt, a full-brother to multiple Group One winner Wild Illusion, beat Megallan by a length.

His jockey William Buick said: ‘He is the type of horse, looking at him, that will be better next year. A mile is perfect for him at the moment, but he will get further next season.’

Meanwhile, US trainer Wesley Ward has said that Campanelle will miss next Saturday’s Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket to be aimed at the Breeders’ Cup at Keeneland in November.

Campanelle’s two trips to Europe this season have resulted in wins in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Prix Morny at Deauville.
