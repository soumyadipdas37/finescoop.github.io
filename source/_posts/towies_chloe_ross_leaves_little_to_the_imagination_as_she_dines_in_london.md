She told her followers: 'How cool is this shop, so for every pair of sunglasses that they actually sell, they give a pair away to people in need!'

Chloe has been returning to the streets of Essex as her and fellow castmates have been filming the upcoming series of ITVBe's The Only Way Is Essex, which will celebrate the show's 10-year anniversary.  

Friendly faces: Chloe was seen in London with pal, Chris Kowalski

The 10th anniversary series was due to start filming in March 2020, but ITV bosses made the tough decision to put the production on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It's thought that original cast members were going to make a surprise appearance to celebrate the success of the show. 

However it is now believed that episodes will show some of TOWIE's most iconic moments, with stars both old and new, commenting on them. 

Fans of the show have been left without their Essex fix this year, but the wait may be over soon. 

The show will run for ten episodes, with each installment focusing on one drama filled year of the Brentwood icons.
