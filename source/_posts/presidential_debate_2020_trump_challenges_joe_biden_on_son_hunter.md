President Donald Trump twice leveled slashing attacks on Joe Biden's son Hunter about his business dealings and drug problem at Tuesday night's debate – and both times it was a line by Biden that prompted him to go on offense.

Trump, aided by fresh research from a Republican-run committee, tore into Hunter Biden's overseas business arrangements including deals while Joe Biden was serving as vice president.

But after one angry attack, Biden sought to turn the tables, vaguely referencing Trump's kin and telling the camera: 'This is not about family. It’s about your family.'  

President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden exchanged angry words after Trump attacked Biden's son, Hunter

After days of foreshadowing that he would try go after Biden by hitting his son for corruption, it took a long stretch before President Trump got to the issue that has become a feature of his press conferences and Fox News appearances. 

Unexpectedly, it was Biden who was the first to bring up China – a place where Hunter Biden did business – as he blasted Trump for the trade deals he has negotiated and sought to undermine Trump’s claims of bringing back manufacturing jobs.

Coming about halfway through the debate, it jolted Trump into bringing his attacks on Hunter Biden.

‘China ate your lunch, Joe!’ Trump scolded him.

‘And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars.’ It was a reference to business Hunter Biden did with his firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, LLC and business it secured in China. 

Trump brought up a Senate Republican report that claimed Hunter got $3.5 million from the wealthy wife of the former Mayor of Moscow. Hunter Biden’s lawyer has denied the characterization and said funds were wired to the firm.

‘What did he do to deserve it?’ Trump asked.

‘My son did nothing wrong in Burisa,’ said Biden – after Trump expanded his attack to Hunter Biden’s lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.

It resulted in still more angry cross-talk at a debate that set new standards for interruptions and intensity.

‘He doesn’t want to let me answer because he knows I have the truth,’ Biden said.

‘It’s hard to get any word in with this clown – excuse me, this person,’ Biden said after delivering the insult.

‘His family we could talk about all night,’ Biden said, but stopping short of specifics, as White House advisor Ivanka Trump and Trump Organization execs Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in the audience.

Then, Biden faced the camera and delivered a line meant to shut down the attack. ‘This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family,’ he told viewers.

‘He doesn’t want to talk about what you need … The American people. That’s what we’re talking about here,' Biden scolded.

More than an hour into the angry clash, Biden said Trump 'never keeps his word,' and brought up comments that sources told the Atlantic Trump made about fallen troops – referring to them as 'suckers' and 'losers.' Trump again denied it.

Biden made an impassioned pitch for his late son Beau's military service. He spent a year in Iraq serving in the National Guard. 

'Speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military — the way you talk about them being losers and being, and just being suckers — my son was in Iraq and he spent a year there,' Biden said.

'He got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes,' said Biden. 

'You talking about Hunter?' Trump asked, rhetorically after Biden mentioned his son.

Biden answered he was speaking of Beau.  

'I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter,' Trump interrupted, then amped up his attacks. 

'He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president,' Trump said.

“That’s not true. None of that is true,' Biden responded.    

'He made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow, in various other places,' Trump said. 

Hunter Biden received an administrative discharge from the Navy in after failing a drug test for cocaine in 2013. He was seeking to be commissioned as a reserve officer. He did not receive a dishonorable discharge, but an administrative one, according to press accounts at the time. 

Biden responded: 'My son, like a lot of people we know at home, he had a drug problem.'

'He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it,' Biden said. 'And I'm proud of him.'
