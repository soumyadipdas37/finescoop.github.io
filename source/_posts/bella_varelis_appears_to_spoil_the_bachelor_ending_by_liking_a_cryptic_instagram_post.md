She has been a frontrunner to win The Bachelor Locky Gilbert's heart from day one, and she has made it into the final two alongside Irena Srbinovska.  

But on Wednesday, Bella Varelis appeared to spoil the ending of the hit Channel 10 dating show by hinting that her relationship with the hunky 31-year-old is over.

Bachelor fan account Bachiefunny pointed out that the 25-year-old had tellingly liked an Instagram post about about people ‘giving up’ on relationship.

Spoiler: On Wednesday, Bella Varelis (pictured) appeared to spoil the ending of the hit Channel 10 dating show, hinting that her relationship with Locky Gilbert is over 

The post read: 'Being in a relationship in this generation genuinely makes me nervous because you never know when someone will give up'. 

Alongside the post, Bachiefunny commented: 'A great start to finale week, shall we just turn off now? Bella loves those subtle hints'.

This isn't the first time Bella has hinted that she doesn't end up with the former Survivor star.

On Monday, the marketing consultant described eliminated contestant Bec Cvilikas as her 'other half' on the show rather than Locky, once again hinting that she doesn't receive the final rose.  

'Bec was my other half. Once we met, it was like, yep, we're going to be friends,' Bella told New Idea.

While Bella was only talking about her friendship with Bec, 25, the use of the term 'other half' is telling since it is normally reserved for romantic partners.

Meanwhile, Bec said: 'The second we met, I knew we were going to be friends.' 

Bella and Bec have remained close since the show wrapped and have been spotted frequently hanging out together. 

The Bachelor concludes Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10.
