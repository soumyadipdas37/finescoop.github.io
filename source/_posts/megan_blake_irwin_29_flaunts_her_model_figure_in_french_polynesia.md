It comes after Megan and Skeet seemingly confirmed they had broken up in August after dating for three months.

They unfollowed each other on Instagram and also removed photos of each other.

A series of cryptic posts have since surfaced on Megan's account, which shed light on how the model is coping with her split from the 50-year-old actor.
