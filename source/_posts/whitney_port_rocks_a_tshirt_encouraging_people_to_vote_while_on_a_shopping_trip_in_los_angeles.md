Whitney Port stepped out in Los Angeles on Wednesday in search of some new furnishings to refresh her home's look.

The 35-year-old star of The Hills: New Beginnings opted for a casual and comfortable ensemble while in search of a vintage chandelier to restore.

The reality star broadcast a call for civic engagement thanks to her white crop top which read 'Vote' in block letters and a red-lipped mouth.

Whitney showed off a bit of her toned tummy under the shirt and matched it with a set of white cut-off jeans.

The 5ft10in star of The City kept her look low-key with checker print Vans slip-on sneakers, and she kept her blonde tresses styled straight and cascading down her shoulders.

She covered her face with a gray and white striped cloth masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Whitney was seen carrying her large black Fendi monogrammed handbag and multiple paper shopping bags out to her SUV, as well as a black and white patterned jug.

In her Instagram Stories, she showed off some of her finds, including a gray metal chandelier.

Later, she posted another weathered fixture that matched one her mother owned that she planned to restore.

Whitney included a photo from inside the store, Studio City's Little Moon Society.

'Had to run some errands. Felt so nice to be inside this cute store,' she captioned it.

Joining Whitney on her errand run was her three-year-old son Sonny, who looked cute in a T-shirt with a wolf on the front, orange shorts and a red and blue gingham mask.

The TV fixture shares him with her husband Tim Rosenman, whom she met when he was a producer on The City.

The couple began dating in 2012, two years after the two-season show was canceled, and they married in November 2015, before they welcomed Sonny in 2017.

Although Whitney and Tim have considered having a second child, she revealed earlier this month on the With Whit podcast that she was interested in a second child but was holding off until she felt more 'mentally stable.'

'I know deep down I would like to have another baby. I want Sonny to have another sibling. I feel it would complete our family,' she began. 

'Our family feels complete, but it doesn't feel fully to the extent complete, like the ultimate level of greatness, that I think our family could be,' she explained.

Whitney also admitted she has 'some work' to do on herself, before feeling 'ready to take on this next layer of responsibility.'

While she talked about previously 'leaving it all up to fate' and 'going off' her birth control, Port has recently begun focusing on getting her 'emotions straight.' 

'I really don't feel in a mentally stable place to get pregnant right now,' she confessed.
