Charles Oakley became the first contestant to be eliminated Tuesday on season 29 of Dancing With The Stars.

The 56-year-old former NBA star, who spent 20 years as a power forward for some of the league's biggest teams, failed to wow the judges with his scattered cha cha this week.

He and partner Emma Slater, 31, earned just 15 points for their dance to the Luther Vandross song Never Too Much.

That left him tied at the bottom of the DWTS leaderboard with Carole Baskin, 59, a star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King.

Carole survived after judges Carrie Ann Inaba and Derek Hough voted to save her. 

The big cat rights activist tried to move up in the rankings this week, yet scored just 16 points for her Viennese waltz to Tom Jones' What's New Pussycat, an on-the-nose choice.

Carole was still happy with her score, and the judges' comments that she was 'shining' onstage, especially since she'd gone through such a tough year.

She told partner Pasha Pashkov, 35, that all the 'negative attention' from the documentary hurt her family, and her daughter no longer read the news.

'I've seen what the media can do to you,' Carole said. 'And I hate that I try even harder to be strong in their presence. I keep it inside and wait until everybody's gone before I can break down. I don't know how to make it better.'

Carole hoped that being on DWTS would help her daughter look at her more positively, and cautioned her family she'd be crying on camera.

At the top of the leaderboard was Justina Machado, 48, and partner Sasha Farber, 36, who did a foxtrot to Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey's When You Believe.

'My goodness, you are such a natural, beautiful dancer,' Derek, 36, told Justina, as Bruno Tonioli, 64, affirmed that she seemed to 'dance from the heart.'

She and Sasha received 21 points for their dance, giving them 42 points overall.

Reality star Kaitlyn Bristowe, 35, tied for first with Artem Chigvintsev, 38, earning 42 points total, and 22 for their foxtrot to Lee Ann Womack's I Hope You Dance.

All night, Tyra suggested that an injury to Kaitlyn's ankle, sustained during rehearsal, might keep her from performing, but she went on.

The judges loved Kaitlyn's elegant lines, the result of 13 years spent preparing for a career in professional dance, which she never ended up pursuing.

'Wow, if that's how you dance with an injured foot, I would love to see how you dance without the injury,' said Carrie Ann, 52, as Derek called the dance 'effortless.'

TV host Nev Schulman, 35, earned praise from Bruno for the 'dynamism' he showed in his cha cha to the new hit BTS song Dynamite with Jenna Johnson, 26.

'The music and the energy gets inside of you, and it just comes out,' said Nev, who scored 21 points from the judges.

Disney star Skai Jackson, 18, missed steps during her samba to Ne-Yo's Miss Independent with her partner, Alan Bersten, 26, and earned just 15 points.

'All performances have moments when things don't go your way,' Bruno said.

Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir, 36, danced a tango to Lady Gaga's Poker Face, a song he'd also skated to as he loved Gaga 'like a whale loves fish.'

Carrie Ann told Johnny that his footwork with partner Britt Stewart, 31, 'was a bit odd… it doesn't feel like you've quite found the floor right yet.'

Despite his love of the song, 'Johnny Gaga' got just 18 points for his dance.

Monica Aldama, 50, the head coach on Netflix's hit show Cheer, did a jive to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off with Val Chmerkovskiy, 34.

As a coach herself, Monica hated scoring poorly on technique last week, but liked the challenges of dance.

The judges gave Monica 16 points for her routine, with Bruno saying her cheer background clearly helped her 'project this kind of joy and happiness.'

Backstreet Boys singer AJ McLean, 42, and partner Cheryl Burke, 36, swept the floor with their foxtrot to Dean Martin's Ain't That A Kick In The Head.

'The Rat Pack would be proud,' Bruno told AJ after he danced, though he warned him to 'control the energy' because the foxtrot is all about 'gliding.'

AJ and Cheryl received a 19 for their dance. 

Anne Heche, 51, and Keo Motsepe, 30, also did a foxtrot to OneRepublic's Counting Stars, for which they nabbed 18 points.

Anne said her goal was not to embarrass her sons, Atlas, 11, and Homer, 18. 

Grammy-winning rapper Nelly, 45, and his partner Daniella Karagach, 28, turned in a jubilant cha cha to Earth, Wind & Fire's Let's Groove.

Bruno admired Nelly's 'fantastic musicality' and good timing, though he cautioned him to work on the articulation of his feet while dancing.

NFL star Vernon Davis, 36, received 18 points for his athletic paso doble to Rihanna and Calvin Harris' We Found Love, danced with Peta Murgatroyd, 34.

'Beware! There's a new bull on the block and he's not messing around!' Bruno crowed after watching Vernon.

Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause, 39, revealed her poverty-stricken past to her partner Gleb Savchenko, 37, during rehearsals for their performance on the show.

Chrishell, who last year was hit with a divorce filing by her ex, actor Justin Hartley of the NBC show This Is Us, showed Gleb the lavish home she was selling.

When Gleb asked if she'd always lived well, Chrishell revealed that she grew up poor, squatting with her family in an abandoned schoolhouse in Kentucky. 

The two of them later performed a sexy rumba to This is Me from The Greatest Showman and their connection was obvious onscreen.

Carrie Ann liked what she saw, telling Chrishell, 'What a difference. You're like a whole different dancer. You're dancing from your heart.' 

She and Gleb moved forward in the competition, with 18 points out of 30. 

In a cute segment, new host Tyra Banks, 46, taught the celebrities how to 'smize,' or smile with their eyes, but most of them failed miserably.

She told Nev, creator of the TV show Catfish, that she was jealous that he'd gotten 'catfish' in the dictionary when she'd been trying to get 'smize' in for ages.

Dancing With The Stars will return next week on ABC.
