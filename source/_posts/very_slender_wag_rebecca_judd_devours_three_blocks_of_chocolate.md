She's made no secret about her addiction to chocolate.

And AFL WAG Rebecca Judd was indulging her sweet tooth again on Thursday night, this time devouring a block of Darrell Lea's new Bondi milk. 

The 37-year-old, who is currently in hard lockdown with her family at her $7.3million mansion in Brighton, Melbourne, showed off her enviable haul of goodies on Instagram.

The mother-of-four had tucked into the Bondi block, and was about to munch on some Rocky Road and Caramilk too, washing it all down with a cup of tea.

Rebecca has often spoken about her obsession with Caramilk and even wowed fans when she made some cookies with the chocolate, last month.

In June, she was gifted 10 blocks of the delicious Cadbury variety by her friend, Emma Pellicano.

While Rebecca loves her sweet treats, she balances her desserts with a healthy diet.

She also works out regularly to maintain her very slender figure.

Back in April, the Postcard presenter explained she's been doing a daily Pilates session from Keep It Cleaner, and posted a demonstration video on her Instagram page.

She said that no equipment was needed and it's perfect for everyone to do while stuck at home while they are self-isolating.

Dressed in a figure-hugging pair of mint stripe camouflage pants from Jaggad, Rebecca showed off her toned and pert derriere as she performed a series of kickbacks.

The model and TV presenter then rolled over, flaunting her washboard abs under her mint running T-shirt, which she wore knotted at the waist. 

'I've been a member of the Keep It Cleaner community for a long time now but since being in Iso I have done one of their workouts every single day,' Rebecca captioned the post.

'I want to come out of iso stronger and fitter than I’ve ever been, and it’s working,' she added.

Rebecca previously told Daily Mail Australia about her diet, saying that while it's rather relaxed, she always has a healthy dinner.

Speaking about her day on a plate, she said she enjoys muesli for breakfast, focaccia for lunch, and meat and vegetables for dinner.

'Breakfast is usually muesli and a strong latte,' she said.

'Lunch I'll grab my fave brown rice sushi or a focaccia, yum!'

The radio presenter said that for dinner, she and her AFL star husband Chris Judd, 37, typically tuck into fish or meat with vegetables.

'Dinner I usually will have meat or fish and vegetables which Chris and I both love.'

Rebecca also revealed that her children aren't fussy eaters, no doubt a good thing when it comes to cooking family dinners.

She shares four children with AFL star husband Chris, son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and twin sons Tom and Darcy, three.
