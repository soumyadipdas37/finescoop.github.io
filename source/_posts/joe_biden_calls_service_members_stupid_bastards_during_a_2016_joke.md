Video of former Vice President Joe Biden jokingly calling service members 'stupid b*****ds' during a 2016 speech to Air Force troops has resurfaced after conservatives blasted a brief clip of the speech. 

Biden, who was President Obama's Vice President at the time, had been with his wife giving a speech to 1000 members of the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing on March 7 in an 'undisclosed location in Southwest Asia.' 

Jill Biden had offered her remarks before the former vice president was introduced by 1st Lt. Karen Johnson, who he had nominated to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy when he was still a Delaware senator.

It was then that Biden cracked his joke.  

Biden, who was Vice President at the time, had been with his wife giving a speech to 1000 members of the 380th Air Expeditionary Wing on March 7, 2016 in Abu Dahbi

'I have incredibly good judgment,' he said to the crowd. 'One, I married Jill. And two, I appointed Johnson to the academy. I just want you to know that. Clap for that, you stupid bastards.'

Several service members chuckled at the joke as the crowd lightly applauded for Biden. 

He continued:  'Come on, man. Man, you are a dull bunch. Must be slow here, man. I don't know.' 

Biden did sing praise for Johnson and all the other service members who took the time to hear him and Jill speak.   

The joke was made after 1st Lt. Karen Johnson, who Biden nominated to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy when was still a Delaware senator, introduced him to the audience

'I have incredibly good judgment,' he joked. 'One, I married Jill. And two, I appointed Johnson to the academy. I just want you to know that. Clap for that, you stupid bastards'

'I want to thank Brig. Gen. Orcutt for welcoming me and my family here today,' he said. 'I know your ops tempo out here is pretty high and you got better things to do than come see Jill and me, but we never pass up an opportunity wherever we are around the world to try and see our warriors.' 

Biden would then assert that the armed forces were crucial in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. 

'We are taking the fight to (ISIL) now, and pursuing all those who would do harm to America,' Biden said. 'You are the instrument in a strategy to reclaim territory that they have taken and destroy their financial assets. We have to squeeze the heart of (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria so they can't continue to pump their poison into the region and the rest of the world.' 

In his closing remarks, Biden once again offered words of support for the armed forces. 

Joe Biden would offer praises for the military in his remarks, which have recently resurfaced because of conservative pundits

'You're the finest generation of warriors the world has ever, ever known,' he concluded. 

Clips of Biden's joke has been circulating heavily as conservative pundits slam him as being 'hypocritical.' The former Vice President recently released an ad critical of President remarks about soldiers, where he allegedly called those killed in combat 'losers' and 'suckers.'

Campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates explained in a statement to the Daily Beast that the comments were made to 'jokingly encourage the audience to clap' for Johnson.  

'Vice President Biden was jokingly encouraging the audience to clap for an airwoman on the stage, and a number of service members can be seen laughing and smiling at the comment. Seconds before, he praised them for 'the incredible sacrifices [they] make for our country,' Bates said.

The comments were made in Abu Dhabi, according to the Daily Beast, but most military reports say that the remarks took place at an 'undisclosed location in Southwest Asia.'
