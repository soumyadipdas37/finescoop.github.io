Anne Winters has dressed up in Madonna's most iconic looks to get her attention.  

The 26-year-old actress re-created images of herself channeling the seven-time Grammy winner from her Like a Prayer and Material Girl music videos, among others, because she wants to star in the legend's self-directed biopic.

And the 13 Reasons Why star has also revealed that the 62-year-old hitmaker is now following her on social media and has even 'reached out' after viewing the photos. 

Going for it: Anne Winters from 13 Reasons Why re-created Madonna's most iconic looks in a bid to star in the singer's self-directed biopic; here she has dressed up as the singer from her 1989 Like A Prayer music video

'Anything is possible when you go for what you want, AND HAVE the muhf**king talent to back it up of course,' the Emmy winner captioned a fan edit on Sunday, which featured her and Madonna side-by-side.

Over the weekend, the actress began sharing images of herself  depicting the musical icon over the years, in a bid to star in her upcoming self-directed biopic. 

'BLOW UP @Madonna Instagram guys — I wana [sic] play her in her new biopic,' Winters captioned the first image of herself. 'I've been told I look like young Madonna forever, I act I sing I look like her.... cmon now.' 

Going for it: She went on to explain 'casting and film business has been whack af' amid the coronavirus pandemic, so she was 'trying a new tactic' to land the leading role in the film. Here she is in Madonna's Like A Virgin look in 1984

Confident! 'BLOW UP @Madonna Instagram guys — I wana [sic] play her in her new biopic,' Winters captioned the first image of herself. 'I've been told I look like young Madonna forever, I act I sing I look like her.... cmon now'

Creating buzz: After causing a digital stir by showcasing her striking resemble to Madonna, Anne Winters successfully earned recognition and praise from the Queen of Pop. The image on the left is from Madonna's Borderline music video in 1983

She went on to explain 'casting and film business has been whack af' amid the coronavirus pandemic, so she was 'trying a new tactic' to land the leading role in the film.

Winters went on to post several different looks, using the hashtags #minimadonna, #hireme and #BLONDEAMBITION, in reference to the performer's 1990 world tour. 

The Vogue singer is working on her biopic with Diablo Cody, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of the 2007 gem Juno, and Amy Pascal, who will produce it. 

Speaking about the project recently on Instagram, Madonna said: 'I want to convey the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a ­musician, a dancer – a human being, trying to make her way in this world.

'The focus of this film will always be music. Music has kept me going and art has kept me alive. There are so many untold and inspiring stories and who better to tell it than me.

'It's essential to share the rollercoaster ride of my life with my voice and vision.'

Identical: Some of Winters recreations were seamless, as she slipped into character. Here she is mimicking Madonna's look from the Papa Don't Preach music video from 1986

Bold move: She went on to explain 'casting and film business has been whack af' amid the coronavirus pandemic, so she was 'trying a new tactic' to land the leading role in the film, which the Vogue singer is working on 

Earlier this week, it was revealed the film will explore some of the darker aspects of her life before rising to stardom, including being raped at knifepoint at the age of 20.

A source told The Mirror: 'She lost her mother to cancer when she was just five, something a child never gets over. But she turned her loss and pain into a creative force to be reckoned with. 

'There will be some shockers, as that is just part of her DNA. This has been an incredibly cathartic process for Madonna,' the insider continued. 

'She is uncovering memories that have long been left dormant. She has done and achieved so much, so to have this time to reflect has been quite magical.' 

Madonna previously revealed she was raped after moving from Michigan to New York to begin her music career.

Exciting: Winters went on to post several different looks, using the hashtags #hireme and #BLONDEAMBITION, in reference to the performer's 1990 world tour. This look is from the 1990 movie Dick Tracy

In an essay for Harper's Bazaar, she wrote: 'New York wasn't everything I thought it would be. It did not welcome me with open arms. The first year, I was held up at gunpoint.

'Raped on the roof of a building I was dragged up to with a knife in my back, and had my apartment broken into three times. I don't know why; I had nothing of value after they took my radio the first time.'

She previously explained: 'I was told that if I wanted to press charges, that, you know, a physical examination, I would have to go before the court, they are going to ask you all these personal questions. 

'You've already been violated, so then, do you want to talk about it? Do you want to make it public? No, it's just not worth it. It's too humiliating,' she said.
