Julian Draxler was PSG's saviour as the German winger struck in stoppage time to earn his side their first win of the season in a 1-0 victory over Metz.

The German winger headed home late on just as the French champions were preparing to deal with the consequences of a third consecutive league match without a win. 

PSG had Abdou Diallo sent off in the second-half to add to their list of suspensions, which includes Brazilian winger Neymar and defender Layvin Kurzawa, the latter being handed a six-match ban earlier in the day for violent conduct during the weekend defeat to Marseille.

PSG were also missing Kylian Mbappe, who was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this summer, though fellow attackers Angel Di Maria and Mauro Icardi started the game.

Despite Diallo's red card, which came with 25 minutes to play, the home side continued to push forward but were repeatedly thwarted by the feet of Metz goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja.

Thomas Tuchel's side finally got the goal they craved when Draxler headed into an empty net after Oukidja parried a stinging cross from Angel di Maria.

Having lost their first two matches of the campaign to Lens and Marseille, PSG have three points after three games.
