Rebecca Judd has been left heartbroken after four children were refused entry into Queensland from Sydney to say their final goodbye to their dying father.

Brisbane truck driver Mark Keanes was diagnosed with stage four terminal cancer in his brain and lungs last month and is not expected to make it to Christmas.

Despite the 36-year-old's family applying for an exemption to enter the state a month ago, Queensland Health have so far denied their request.

New South Wales Health has proposed allowing one of his children into Queensland to say their final goodbye.

The department suggested the child could see their father for a supervised one-hour visit before going back across the border. 

Rebecca, 37, shared the heartbreaking story to her Instagram on Thursday and wrote 'the country is broken'.

Meanwhile, anyone entering Queensland is required to complete mandatory $2,800 two-week hotel quarantine.

The state had briefly reopened its southern border in July before shutting again amid a spike in cases in New South Wales. 

Rebecca's post comes after she spent quality time with her three-year-old twin boys Tom and Darcy at her $7.3million Melbourne mansion.

On Tuesday, Rebecca shared a video to Instagram stories while completing creative activities with her boys.

In the video, Bec is seen watching the little ones have a ball as they played with pipe cleaners, paintbrushes and more.

Tom let his mother know he was making a Bart Simpson-inspired puppet while Darcy looked to be equally creative at the dining table.
