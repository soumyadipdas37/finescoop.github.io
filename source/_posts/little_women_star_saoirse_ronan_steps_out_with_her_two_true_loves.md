Enjoying the late summer sunshine, Saoirse Ronan's affections seem divided between her boyfriend and her dog… and occasionally the bagel she chose for breakfast, too. 

The four-time Oscar nominee was pictured out for a stroll near her West London flat with beau Jack Lowden and her four-year-old Westie-golden-retriever cross, Fran. 

They took time to relax in a park before sitting down outside a Notting Hill bakery.

The famously down-to-earth Saoirse, who received her latest Academy Award nomination for playing iron-willed Jo March in the recent adaptation of Louis May Alcott's novel Little Women, couldn't have looked less like an A-lister. 

She was dressed down in a trendy denim skirt, tights and a pair of studded leather monk-strap shoes from British shoemaker Church's, priced at £610. 

The 26-year-old, who grew up in Co Carlow in Ireland, has made no secret of the love she has for Fran.

But the origin of the name she chose is less adorable: she's named after a drug-dealer character in the sometimes harrowing Irish television crime drama Love/Hate. 

Saoirse admitted that 'only Irish people' would understand the name of her pooch, saying: 'Fran from Love/Hate is my favourite character and I love [actor] Peter Coonan in it. I've told him this and I called my Fran after him. 

'Originally we wanted a boy dog and then we met Fran and we were like, "no, it's only ever been you". 

'So she got the name. So technically she's Frances, but she's named after a drug dealer from inner-city Dublin.' 

Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday confirmed that Saoirse was dating 29-year-old Jack, who played her husband Henry in the 2018 movie Mary Queen Of Scots

Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday confirmed that Saoirse was dating 29-year-old Jack, who played her husband Henry in the 2018 movie Mary Queen Of Scots. 

Lowden initially denied they were in a relationship – despite them appearing 'extremely close' at a party in New York. 

Saiorse has previously explained how her name, which means 'freedom' in Irish, is pronounced: 'It's Ser-sha, like inertia.' 

Something her ever-rising career is never blighted by.
