Megan Fox's reputation in Hollywood has long been defined by a misogynistic narrative fueled by male producers and directors.

But the Tennessee-born actress has worked hard to shed the unfair depictions of her in the media over the years.

She recently explained how her 2009 cult classic feminist horror Jennifer's Body suffered at the box office, following the post-Transformers backlash from her feud with director Michael Bay.

The 34-year-old appeared Monday on the podcast Eli Roth's History of Horror: Uncut, where she discussed the movie's devoted following.

She mused: 'It’s a nice circle. I didn’t expect it to grow like that. But to see it being appreciated now, obviously makes me feel really good. I’m happy for Diablo [Cody, writer] and I’m happy for Karyn [Kusama, director].

'All these people put in a lot of hard work into making a really quality project that was panned for reasons that had nothing to do with them. A lot of it was just about my image at the time and who I was in the media at the time and the backlash to that. The movie never really stood a chance.'

Fox starred as the titular Jennifer Check, a popular girl who's chosen by an indie band frontman (played by Adam Brody) to be their virgin sacrifice in a spell that will bring them fortune and fame.

But as she wasn't actually a virgin, she comes back as a succubus, feeding on her male classmates, as her BFF Needy (Amanda Seyfried) attempts to vanquish her evil.

The movie has maintained a cult following over the years, which has only grown with the #MeToo era, as audiences have developed a new appreciation and understanding for the film and her career.

Jennifer's Body ultimately fizzled with both critics and box offices, which Fox credits to her image as a vapid sex symbol at the time.

She continued: 'I was being vilified a little bit when the movie was getting ready for its release, it was that interesting juxtaposition to shooting up to extreme heights of fame right before the movie was released and then… the tearing me down was starting to happen. 

Falling out: Fox added of the box office flop: 'Then I had this immediate fallout with someone I worked in the industry. That happened right when I was on the press tour for Jennifer’s Body. I think it all sort of exploded at once'

Infamous feud: Fox was likely referring to the 'fallout' with Bay, 55, whom she worked with on Transformers (2007) and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) (pictured in June, 2008)

The chop: She was fired from the third installment for comparing the director to Napoleon and Hitler

'Then I had this immediate fallout with someone I worked in the industry. That happened right when I was on the press tour for Jennifer’s Body. I think it all sort of exploded at once. I think people definitely viewed me as negative or having bad intentions or just being really shallow and selfish, if it could be reduced and simplified even to that.'

Fox was likely referring to the 'fallout' with Bay, 55, whom she worked with on Transformers (2007) and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), before she was fired from the third installment for comparing the director to Napoleon and Hitler.

The movie's marketing strategy didn't quite help either, as she was still being represented as a sex symbol for young male audiences, but Kusama and Cody were gearing it toward a female following.

Fox told Collider last month: '[The producers wanted] to market this to boys who like Megan Fox. That's who's going to see it. And I was like. No! This is a movie for girls too! That audience, they did not attempt to reach.'

Leading lady: She's since appeared in such films as Friends with Kids (2011), This Is 40 (2012) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)

Hollywood romance: The mother-of-three most recently filmed Midnight in the Switchgrass, where she met boyfriend Machine Gun Kelly, 30

She's since appeared in such films as Friends with Kids (2011), This Is 40 (2012) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014), also filling in for a pregnant Zooey Deschanel, 40, on New Girl, from 2016 to 2017.

The mother-of-three most recently filmed Midnight in the Switchgrass, where she met boyfriend Machine Gun Kelly, 30. 

She starred in the music video for his single Bloody Valentine, which dropped shortly after they were first spotted together in May.

Fox can also be heard gushing over their relationship with Kelly on Banyan Tree (Interlude) from Tickets to My Downfall.
