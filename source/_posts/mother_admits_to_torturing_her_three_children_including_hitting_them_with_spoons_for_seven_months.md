A Queensland mother has pleaded guilty to torturing her three young children and subjecting them to 'excruciating' violence over a seven-month period.

The Moreton Bay woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, put her children through 'gratuitous inflictions of violence and pain' at her home between July 2017 and February 2018.

The three children, who are aged 10 or under, were repeatedly hit with spoons and belts by their mother, or each other if she demanded it.

Brisbane District Court heard the children were starved for more than a week at a time and subject to a horrific beating called 'The Wall'.

The punishment involved the children standing facing a wall with their arms stretched above their heads while being beaten with various objects for hours.

Crown prosecutor Toby Corsbie told the court the oldest son missed school in February due to injuries sustained at home, with authorities notified on his return to class.

'Ultimately, he had physical violence inflicted on every surface of his body,' he said, as reported by NCA NewsWire.

Mr Corsbie said the woman had tried to keep her family's home life a secret from authorities.

'One of the children had told police she had been told not to speak to them,' he said.

The mother's lawyer Patrick Wilson told the court her actions were influenced by her partner and previous abusive relationships.

'She has suffered at the hands of these men in her relationships... the children observed violence directed towards her by the partner,' he said.

Mr Wilson said the mother is doing parenting courses and drug and alcohol counselling.

The mother was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Tuesday. 

Her partner is awaiting trial for his alleged role in beating the children.
