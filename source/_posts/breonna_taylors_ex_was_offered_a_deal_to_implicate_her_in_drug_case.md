The attorney for Breonna Taylor's family says law enforcement offered her convicted drug trafficking ex-boyfriend a plea deal in exchange for naming the slain EMT as his co-defendant in a drug case months after she was killed.

Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested in a drug raid the same night Taylor was shot dead by police in her Louisville, Kentucky apartment, was offered the plea deal last month.

As part of the deal, Glover would have had to admit that he and co-defendants, including Taylor, trafficked drugs in Louisville, according to court documents.

He refused to take the deal from the Jefferson Commonwealth's Attorney's office that could have potentially seen him released on probation for criminal syndication, drug trafficking and gun charges.

Sam Aguiar, the attorney who is representing Taylor's family in a wrongful death lawsuit, has slammed law enforcement and accused them of going to extreme lengths to try and tarnish the slain woman's name in the wake of her death. 

'The fact that they would try to even represent that she was a co-defendant in a criminal case more than a month after she died is absolutely disgusting,' Aguiar told WDRB. 

In a Facebook post, Aguiar added that the plea deal was being used to justify the search of her home and her subsequent killing. 

'Breonna Taylor is not a 'co-defendant' in a criminal case. She's dead. Way to try and attack a woman when she's not even here to defend herself,' the attorney said. 

Aguiar noted the plea deal was made on July 13 - exactly four months after Taylor was killed.    

Glover was arrested in a drug raid just moments before Louisville police stormed into Taylor's apartment about 10 miles away on March 13.

Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was shot dead by police serving the 'no knock' narcotics search warrant at her apartment.  

Officers never found any drugs in her home. 

An officer was shot during the raid by Taylor's boyfriend who has since said he thought he was defending against a home invasion. 

Taylor's ex-boyfriend, who was arrested last week on new drug charges, has repeatedly said on recorded jail phone calls that Taylor was not involved in any drug operations. 

Glover, who had an on-and-off again relationship with Taylor starting in 2016, has also previously questioned why officers would search her home. 

The warrant used to enter Taylor's home was secured by police observing Glover, a suspected drug dealer, who had been spotted at her home two months earlier. 

Officers had been tracking Glover for several months and, at one point, saw him getting out of a vehicle registered to Taylor that was later spotted several times outside a suspected drug house, according to the New York Times.

Glover listed Taylor's apartment as his address and was spotted on surveillance leaving her home with a package as recently as January.

Taylor had also paid Glover's bail in 2017 and 2019 when he was arrested on drug charges.

In a jail call in January when Glover asked her to pay bail again, Taylor told him that she was stressed when he was around 'because I just always be worried about you with the police'. 

She had cut ties with Glover about a month before the fatal raid that ended her life. 

Taylor's family attorney said police failed to recognize this.

'Breonna was a woman who was figuring everything out in her life, who had turned a corner,' Aguiar told the NYT. 

'Breonna was starting to live her best life.' 

In a jail call after Taylor was shot dead, Glover told an unidentified man that Taylor had been 'hanging onto my money'. 

He claimed she had $14,000 of his money in her apartment. 

'She had the eight I gave her the other day... and she picked up another six,' Glover said in the call.

Aguiar said no money was found in Taylor's apartment following her death.
