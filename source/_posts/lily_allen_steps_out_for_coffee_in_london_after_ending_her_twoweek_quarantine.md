The carefree hedonism of Las Vegas was replaced by the grey formality of London as Lily Allen stepped out on Wednesday, little more than a fortnight after exchanging vows with David Harbour. 

The singer's wedding and engagement rings were clearly visible as she made her first appearance in the English capital since marrying Harbour in a whirlwind Nevada ceremony on September 7th. 

Her appearance also marked the end of an enforced two-week quarantine period following her return to England, the result of tough travel regulations in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.

Enjoying what appeared to be her first breath of fresh air since leaving the US without her new husband, who remains in his native New York, Lily, 35, ensured she stood out in an extravagant coat from Italian fashion brand Miu Miu. 

She added to her look with a turtle-neck sweater and skinny black jeans, while matching knee length boots rounded things off. 

Accessorising tastefully, the stylish star gave the ensemble an elegant by flourish sporting a quilted Chanel handbag and accompanying sunglasses from the French fashion house.
