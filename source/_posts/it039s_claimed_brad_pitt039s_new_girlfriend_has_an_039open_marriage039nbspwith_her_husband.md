He&#039;s&nbsp;hardly the first husband to discover his wife has a crush on Brad Pitt &ndash; but Roland Mary may be the first man to give his blessing to an affair with the Hollywood heart-throb.
After model Nicole Poturalski, 27, was linked to the actor last week, it was soon revealed that she has been married to Mr Mary, a 68-year-old restaurateur, for eight years.
Now it is claimed they have an &lsquo;open marriage&rsquo; and that she may even have met Pitt at her husband&rsquo;s restaurant, the upmarket Borchardt in Berlin.

Mr Mary &ndash; apparently no stranger to romantic trials and tribulations after reputedly being married four times &ndash; has remained tight-lipped about his marital arrangements, and his wife&rsquo;s friendship with Pitt.
However, a friend reportedly said &lsquo;Roland is a very philosophical guy.&nbsp;
&#039;He has been married several times and has five children.&nbsp;
&#039;He is not interested in negativity or jealousy.&nbsp;
&#039;They are still married, but you could describe their relationship as an &ldquo;open marriage&rdquo;.&rsquo;
That might explain why Mr Mary is exhibiting remarkable restraint given how publicly his wife appears to be celebrating her dalliance with the Oscar-winning actor.
She was photographed with the 56-year-old star on Wednesday arriving at Le Castellet airport near Marseille in the South of France on Pitt&rsquo;s private jet.
They then headed for Chateau Miraval, the &pound;50 million wine estate where he married his second wife Angelina Jolie, and which the couple still own jointly.
On Thursday, Polish-born Miss Poturalski, who is known professionally as Nico Mary, posted an enigmatic picture of two badminton rackets floating on a swimming pool on Instagram along with emojis of a whale and an ice cube.&nbsp;
The symbols are said to represent &lsquo;cheerfulness and happiness&rsquo; and that &lsquo;everything is cool&rsquo; respectively.
Indeed, visitors to her various social media accounts, featuring many pictures of her modelling bikinis and skimpy sportswear, have been given hints about a mystery man since March.
Last November &ndash; three months after apparently meeting Pitt at her husband&rsquo;s restaurant &ndash; she detailed a six-week trip to Los Angeles, including visits to Malibu, Santa Monica and Venice beaches.
The trip culminated with her watching a concert by rapper Kanye West at the Hollywood Bowl with Pitt, it eventually emerged last week.&nbsp;
If the relationship is confirmed &ndash; and Pitt&rsquo;s representatives have declined to comment &ndash; Miss Poturalski would be the star&rsquo;s first serious partner since he split acrimoniously from Ms Jolie in 2015.
The couple, who have six children together, were legally divorced in April last year, and Pitt has described how the collapse of the marriage took a heavy toll on him.
Last night, a friend told The Mail on Sunday &lsquo;Brad found his split from Angelina very difficult. It broke him, so finding a new girlfriend was the last thing on his mind. His children and his sobriety were his priorities.&nbsp;
&#039;Any new relationships at the beginning of getting sober are a no-go for a year so he avoided women. But Nicole came along at just the right time, when he was ready.&rsquo;

Pitt, who was married to Jennifer Aniston until he fell for Ms Jolie on the set of the film Mr And Mrs Smith, first visited the Borchardt restaurant in 2009 when he was filming Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s Inglourious Basterds in the German capital.
He returned to the restaurant &ndash; which is described as &lsquo;having a feel of money and glamour&rsquo; and has previously served Barack Obama, George Clooney and Natalie Portman &ndash; last year when he was promoting Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, another Tarantino hit.
According to unconfirmed rumours, Ms Poturalski gave him her phone number during the visit. Other reports claim, however, that they were introduced through mutual friends.
Last weekend, a source told the American TV channel Entertainment Tonight &lsquo;When they first started seeing each other, they told no one about it.
&lsquo;Even some of their inner circle of friends are only finding out now. Brad has been very private about dating and now more than ever he doesn&rsquo;t want to rock the boat with Angelina.&rsquo;
Described by friends as &lsquo;smart&rsquo;, Warsaw-born Miss Poturalski speaks five languages and has a seven-year-old son with Mr Mary.
She also owns a small farm outside Berlin where she raises sheep and is signed to A Management, a modelling agency in Germany, and Next Management in the US, which also represents singer Billie Eilish and British model Alexa Chung.
Like Ms Jolie, she is unafraid to stand up for what she believes. In May, for example, she wore a red top from campaign group CHNGE that bore the slogan &lsquo;Protect Kids, Not Guns&rsquo;.
On Instagram, she shares ways to end child sex trafficking under the heading &lsquo;Save the kids&rsquo;.
