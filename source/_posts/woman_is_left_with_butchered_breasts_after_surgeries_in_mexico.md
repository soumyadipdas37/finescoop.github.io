A woman has revealed that she was left with unsightly scars all over her stomach and 'butchered boobs' after having plastic surgery in Mexico — not once, not twice, but three times.   

In a preview clip from Monday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched, Jessica shocks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif as she opens up about her disastrous surgeries and her decision to keep going under the knife.  

After undergoing a dramatic weight loss that left her with sagging skin, Jessica had a breast augmentation and a tummy tuck in Guadalajara, but she wasn't 'happy' with her results. That's when she headed to Tijuana.

Problems: Jessica shocks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif as she opens up about her disastrous surgeries in Mexico on Monday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched 

First: After undergoing a dramatic weight loss that left her with sagging skin, Jessica had a breast augmentation and a tummy tuck in Guadalajara, but she wasn't 'happy' with the results

'I wanted bigger breasts, maybe even another tummy tuck,' she explains to the doctors. 'I still had, you know, flabby skin.' 

Jessica opted to have another breast augmentation to increase the size of her implants, another tummy tuck, and liposuction —  this time in Tijuana, where her friend had recently had plastic surgery.  

'The surgeon taped me with surgical tape. No gauze. Nothing,' she recalls. 'So I called my sister, and she's slowly, slowly trying to remove it.' 

Jessica's sister tells the doctors that it looked like the skin was actually 'coming off with the tape.' 

And that basically left me with scars everywhere,' Jessica adds. 

Ouch: Jessica wanted 'bigger breasts' and more skin removed, so she went to Tijuana to have another round of surgeries. The surgeon applied surgical tape directly onto her wounds

Disaster: When the surgical tape was removed, she was left with scars all over her stomach

'Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif are visibly stunned that her surgeon would make such a grave and careless mistake.    

'Wow, you know what? I don't think I've ever said this in my entire life. I'm speechless,' Dr. Dubrow tells her. 'Did you call him and say, "Hey I've got this disaster brewing?"' 

Jessica notes that when she contacted the surgeon, he blamed her for removing the tape, saying: 'Well, I told you not to take it off.'   

In his testimonial, Dr. Dubrow warns that tape should never be directly put onto a wound because it will lead to unnecessary scarring.   

'As the skin stretches and becomes swollen, the tape does not expand with it and will cause a burn type reaction to the skin,' he explains. 

Oh no: Despite the trauma, Jessica went under the knife for a second time in Tijuana to fix her breasts and ended up with 'butchered boobs' 

Why risk it? Dr. Nassif (left) and Dr. Dubrow (right) couldn't believe that Jessica would get another surgery in Tijuana after being permenantly scarred 

End result: Jessica says her third breast augmentation left her with a nipple that sits on top of her breast

Despite everything that had happened to her, Jessica decided to have a third breast augmentation in Tijuana, much to the doctors' surprise.    

After my second surgery, I had oval looking breasts. I wanted to do something about it, so I went back to Tijuana. But my third surgeon definitely left me with butchered boob,' she admits in her testimonial.

Dr. Nassif can't help but ask Jessica where that trust came from when she planned another surgery in Tijuana after having such a traumatic experience.

Jessica said she was 'was seeing a lot of girls out and about' with good results from doctors, so she decided to take the plunge — again. But, unfortunately, for Jessica, the third time wasn't a charm. 

'So before my surgery, my nipple was here,' she says, pointing to the middle of her chest. 'My nipple is here now,' she notes, pointing to the top of her breast.

'I mean, this is a disaster,' Dr. Dubrow admits at the end of the clip.
