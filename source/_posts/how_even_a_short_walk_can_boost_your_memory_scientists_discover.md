A short walk, run or bike ride could provide a memory boost in less than an hour.

A scientific review looked at people aged 18 to 35 who walked, ran or cycled at moderate to high intensity and then took tests such as remembering a list of 15 words.

The participants, who exercised in bursts of two minutes, or 15 minutes, half an hour or an hour, improved on tests and showed better concentration and problem-solving skills.

The findings come from 13 studies which were analysed by Swedish researchers.

The authors, from Jonkoping and Linkoping universities, conclude: 'This systematic review strongly suggests that aerobic, physical exercise followed by a brief recovery... improves attention, concentration, and learning and memory functions in young adults.'

Exercise is believed to increase levels of a protein called 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor' which is thought to be important for memory.

But not everyone is a natural athlete or has hours to work out.Â 

The review wanted to see if a single bout of exercise could have an effect, so looked at studies exploring this with young adults over ten years.

The review, published in the journal Translational Sports Medicine, found exercise from two minutes to an hour improved memory and thinking skills for up to two hours.
