Their high-profile split has been full of drama.

And it seems that tensions may once again be ramping up between celebrity exes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

Relations between the former couple who share six children have deteriorated to the point where they are no longer engaging in family therapy ahead of a custody trial slated for next month, UsWeekly reported Thursday.

More drama: Tensions between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are said to have escalated to the point where 'family therapy is no longer taking place,' UsWeekly reported Thursday 

'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place,' a source exclusively told Us Weekly. 

Pitt and Jolie had appeared to reach a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted leaving the actress' LA home in June after spending time with the children.

However, UsWeekly claims they are now at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. 

Eldest child Maddox, 19, is allowed to choose his own timetable and is rumored to no longer have any contact with his father. 

'Brad wants 50/50 joint physical and legal custody of the kids. Angelina has been unagreeable to those terms,' a source told UsWeekly.

The insider added that Jolie 'will only agree to talk about an agreement if the home base for the children isn't Los Angeles. The younger kids are in school in Los Angeles, which Angelina has always been opposed to.'

It's previously been suggested that Jolie wants to relocate to the UK and base the children with her there.

Dispute: 'Brad wants 50/50 joint physical and legal custody of the kids. Angelina has been unagreeable to those terms,' a source told UsWeekly. The insider added that Jolie 'will only agree to talk about an agreement if the home base for the children isn't Los Angeles (Jolie is seen with the children in France in January 2017)

Detente: It had seemed earlier this year that the celebrity exes had reached a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted arriving at the actress' LA home in June (pictured) to spend time with the children.

Pitt and Jolie - who enjoyed the moniker Brangelina during their time together - separated in September 2016 when the Maleficent star filed for divorce following an incident aboard a private jet involving son Maddox and Pitt.

The two had met on the set of the film Mr. & Mrs. Smith that was released in June 2005.

Several months before the movie's debut, Pitt and then wife Jennifer Aniston had announced they were separating after five years of marriage, with the Friends star subsequently filing for divorce in March 2005.

On January 11, 2006, Jolie finally confirmed the romance with Pitt when she confirmed she was pregnant with his child.



Their daughter Shiloh was born in Namibia in May 2006 and two years later, in July 2008, the couple welcomed twins Knox and Vivienne, who were born in Nice, in the south of France.

In early 2006, Pitt also officially adopted Jolie's adopted son Maddox, born in Cambodia, and daughter Zahara, born in Ethiopia. In 2007, they adopted son Pax who is from Vietnam. 

In 2015, the couple officially wed at Château Miraval, their estate in Provence, saying at the time that they had made their union legal for the sake of their children.
