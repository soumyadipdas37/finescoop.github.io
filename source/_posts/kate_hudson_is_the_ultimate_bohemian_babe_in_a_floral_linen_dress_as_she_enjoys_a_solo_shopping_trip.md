Kate Hudson has been getting more than her fill of family time as she quarantines with beau Danny Fujikawa, 34, and her three children amid COVID-19.

But the 41-year-old actress made some time for herself on Saturday afternoon by venturing out of the house and indulging in some much needed retail therapy in the Pacific Palisades.

For her shopping trip, Hudson slipped her fit physique into a Bohemian maxi dress that was riddled with stunning floral details.

Kate's dress also featured feminine puffed sleeves and a flattering tie-wrap waist. 

The daughter of Goldie Hawn had her golden hair tied up into a messy bun and she had on a face mask meant to resemble a cat's nose and whiskers.

She rocked a pair of suede booties and she had a brown leather bag slung over her shoulder.

Hudson had numerous large shopping bags resting in the crook of her arm, including a hefty bag from the designer store Anine Bing.

She, eventually, located her white Tesla in the mall's vast parking lot, slid into the driver's seat, and took off.

Kate and Danny, who first began dating in 2017, share one-year-old daughter Rani Rose.

The Fool's Gold star also has a 16-year-old son Ryder with ex Chris Robinson, 53, and an eight-year-old son Bingham with ex Matt Bellamy, 42.

Kate has successfully juggled a hugely consistent Hollywood career, while raising her three children.

And she recently appeared on Naomi Campbell's podcast No Filter to discuss the demands of her job and the harsh environment actresses are subjected to in Hollywood.

'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies,' admitted Kate to the 50-year-old supermodel.

'The issue with movie making is that it takes you away, and it’s really really sh***y hours, and when you’re doing it it’s like "I better really really like this story. I better love the people I’m working with. I better love this director," or it really is like why am I here?'  

She went on to suggest that, although she loves the movie business, there is a clear gender bias against actresses, which it makes it harder for them to forge their way.  

'One thing in Hollywood – women don’t get the same opportunities, and what I mean by that is one failure is like an equivalent to three failures for a guy.

'One female box office not great opening for a woman… the next time they’re thinking of casting you for something they’ll be like, "her last movie didn’t do great."

'For a guy, they usually give them about three to five chances, right? And they’ll still get paid, and they’ll still get the opportunity but for some reason with women it’s a little bit different.'

'The other thing is that when women get really famous, they don't really want the famous person in the movie, they want a new face, whereas for a guy it's totally different. I think it’s just a bad antiquated habit,' explained Kate.
