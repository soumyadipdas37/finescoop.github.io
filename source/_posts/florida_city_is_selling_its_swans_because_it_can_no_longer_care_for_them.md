A Florida city is selling up to 40 swans, saying they can no longer keep up with caring for the regal birds. 

Lakeland, located in the central part of the state, is known for its significant swan population, and the waterfowl can be seen swimming on Lake Morton. 

The city's very first swans were donated by Queen Elizabeth back in 1957, and they quickly became beloved tourists attractions. 

However, in recent years, the birds have been breeding incessantly and it costs Lakeland a whopping $10,000 annual sum to feed them. 

Now, officials want to sell some of their feathered friends in order to reduce expenses and provide proper care for the ones that will remain in the public's possession. 

The Florida city of Lakeland is set to sell up to 40 swans during a sale later this month  

'We currently have 80 swans here on Lake Morton to feed and care for, so we are looking to sell around 30 to 40 to ensure proper care for them all,' Bob Donahay, Lakeland's Director of Parks and Recreation, told CNN on Wednesday. 

Each year, the birds are rounded up on the lake and confined to large holding pens before they undergo 'annual wellness examinations' by local veterinarians. 

The swan roundup will take place next Tuesday, with the expedition led by Steve Platt, Lakeland's Parks and Recreation Supervisor. He is known as the city's 'Swanfather'. 

Once the birds are inspected and cleared by vets, they will then go on sale to the public. 

The swans will be sold for $400 a pop - a price that officials say is well below market. value.

Lakeland will not conduct background checks on any prospective buyers, but say they will try to get to know the bird lovers as well as possible.

'We will have a great conversation about who they [the buyers] are and what their plans are for the swan or swans,' Donahay told CNN. 

'We will also make ourselves readily available if any of the swans experience medical issues down the road'.  

Donahay says its likely that some will be sold to nursing homes and to engaged couples who hope to feature the majestic birds in their upcoming wedding ceremonies.
