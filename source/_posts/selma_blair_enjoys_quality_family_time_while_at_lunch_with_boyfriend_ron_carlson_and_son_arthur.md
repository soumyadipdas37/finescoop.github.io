Selma Blair has come a long way in the 22 months since going public about her multiple sclerosis diagnosis and grueling chemotherapy treatments.

And on Thursday,  the Cruel Intentions star looked seemingly happy and healthy when she stepped out for a casual afternoon with boyfriend Ron Carlson and her son Arthur Saint Bleick.

The day's events included a stop at a restaurant where the trio sat outside and ate lunch and sipped on the tasty beverages.

Quality time: Selma Blair, 48, enjoyed a casual afternoon  on Thursday in Los Angeles with beau Ron Carlson and son Arthur Saint Bleick, which included lunch at a restaurant

Blair, 48, was all about casual-comfort in the fashion department in a black and white striped shirt that, at times, was partially covered up with a black hoodie.

She also donned baggy black sweatpants, black sneakers and her dark tresses styled in a grown-out pixie-cut, which is a major contrast considering she had lost her hair during a round of experimental chemotherapy.

In accordance to health and safety protocols, the Michigan native wore a red protective mask at all times, with the exception of when she sat down to eat.

They got the memo: Both mom and son fashion coordinated in identical black and white striped shirts and sweatpants

Since there was proper social distancing between the tables and the waiter wore a mask and face shield, Blair was able to feel secure with the risks amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The actress seemed to really content sipping on a cup of tea after enjoying a light meal.

Arthur, nine, appeared to have worn the exact same style shirt as his mother along with a pair of olive-green sweatpants and a white and black mask.

Carlson, 51, looked fit and trim in blue denim jeans, a navy blue t-shirt, white sneakers, a black and white Atari baseball cap and a multi-colored mask. 

Safety first: The trio were able to take off their protective masks amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to proper social distancing at the restaurant

Healthy and radiant: The Cruel Intentions star, who sipped on a cup of tea after a light meal, now has a grown out pixie-cut, which is a major contrast considering she had lost her hair during a round of experimental chemotherapy

After lunch the trio were seen heading on their way down the sidewalk, all wearing their masks again and Arthur cruising along the pavement on a two-wheel kick scooter. 

The actress and novelist reignited their romance in January 2020 following Blair's breakup with David Lyons weeks earlier. 

They had previously dated from July 2017 until about January 2018, which was seven months before her MS diagnosis.
