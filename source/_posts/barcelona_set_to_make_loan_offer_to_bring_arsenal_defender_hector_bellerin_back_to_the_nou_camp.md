Barcelona will reportedly move to bring in Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin on loan this summer.

The LaLiga giants are willing to offload Nelson Semedo, their only specialist in that position, this summer and have turned their attentions to Bellerin as a potential replacement.

Marca have claimed that, due to financial troubles, Barcelona would prefer to seal a temporary switch rather than stump up a sizeable fee.

The arrival of Ronald Koeman as the club's new head coach has triggered the start of a first-team overhaul, with younger players now favoured and members of the older guard shifted to the sidelines.

But Barcelona's transfer business has been heavily restricted due to their monetary woes - meaning they are likely to attempt to piece together a deal which is initially a season-long loan.

Sportsmail has previously reported Arsenal recognise that any substantial fee for Bellerin will allow them to further reinvest in the current window.

This stance means the club are unlikely to be interested, with figures keen to collect a significant sum in return.

Any rejected loan approach could see Barcelona return and attempt to fund a direct transfer, although they are understood to be unlikely to be able to spend over €25million (£23m).

Bellerin, whose contract in north London is set to run down in 2023, left Barcelona as a youngster in 2011 to join Arsenal.  

He has since featured in 205 appearances across all competitions for the club, and may be convinced into taking up a new challenge.

Paris Saint-Germain submitted a £30m offer for the dynamic full back earlier this summer. 

The Champions League finalists have weighed up moving for him for a number of seasons, and their initial offer was worth £25m with a further £5m in add-ons.

It is understood talks are expected to continue with Arsenal determined to hold out for a larger figure.
