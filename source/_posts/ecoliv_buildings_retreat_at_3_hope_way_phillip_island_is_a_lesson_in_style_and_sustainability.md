Architects have built an eco-friendly seaside retreat on the coast of popular holiday destination, Phillip Island.

Designed by Ecoliv Building, a firm headquartered in Gippsland, Victoria which specialises in environmentally-conscious prefabricated housing, 3 Hope Way in Cowes, the main town on the northern side of the island, is a lesson that sustainability can be achieved without compromising on style. 

The single-storey home, which was custom made with 'minimal waste' materials, has an impressively low energy rating thanks to renewable power sources that include solar panels, an electric carport and a 250-litre water tank.

The one-of-a-kind two-bedroom boasts a butler's pantry, two living rooms and a 'floating' egg chair on its spacious outdoor deck - but there's no question that the standout feature is the enormous living room window which captures unrestricted views of the surrounding countryside in its frame.

Architects have built an eco-friendly seaside retreat on the coast of popular holiday destination, Phillip Island

It was designed by Ecoliv Building, a firm headquartered in Gippsland, Victoria which specialises in environmentally-conscious prefabricated housing 

There's no question that the standout feature is the enormous living room window which captures unrestricted views of the surrounding countryside in its frame

Set on 684 square metres of land, the building consists of two 'modules' which intersect in a perpendicular 'T' shape.

The first houses a rumpus room, pantry and open plan kitchen-cum-living area while the second is filled with a bathroom, laundry and both bedrooms.

A mirrored splashback over the kitchen sink creates a reflection of the rural surrounds, flooding the house with natural light and bringing a sense of the outdoors inside.

The interior design compliments the coastal surrounds, with beachy accessories like wicker baskets used throughout

On the side of the house, a large entertainment deck runs parallel to the kitchen while the car port backs onto the bathroom in a further nod to the sustainability of the design.

Ray White listing agent Bec Anderson, who is overseeing the sale of the home, described it as the 'perfect coastal getaway' - an ideal escape from the frenzy of city living where you can work from home against the scenic backdrop of the island.

'These modular homes are designed to compliment the seaside environment,' Ms Anderson told Daily Mail Australia.

While the house was designed with 'low maintenance retirement living' in mind, it would also make a great office, weekend holiday home or Airbnb

'[The designers] use low energy materials in the construction process, which leads to significant long-term reductions in operational energy and increases in sustainability.'

While the house was designed with 'low maintenance retirement living' in mind, Ms Anderson believes it would also make a great office, weekend holiday home or Airbnb, with plenty of tourist attractions like an 18-hole golf course within short walking distance.

The house was listed for private sale on September 26 with an asking price of $645,000 (AUD).
