A self-taught baker who built an online following of 682,000 during coronavirus lockdown has shared her simple recipe for Nutella brownies - with no oven required.

Eloise Head, 26, is the founder of FitWaffle Kitchen, an Instagram page where she posts videos of decadent desserts that take just a few minutes to prepare.

'These are super sweet, but not overpowering with Nutella flavour,' she wrote in the caption, adding they are subtly 'moreish' and 'addictive' for anyone with a sweet tooth.

First, Ms Head mixes the crushed biscuits with melted butter and icing sugar, then adds 250g of Nutella until fully combined.

Next, she spoons the mix into a dish lined with baking paper, pressing down until flat.

Then she melts white chocolate in the microwave and pours it over the base, before melting the remaining 50g of Nutella and drizzling it on top.

Using the back of a palette knife, Ms Head swirls the chocolate liquid into a decorative pattern and leaves the tray in the fridge to set.

Her tutorial quickly amassed more than 20,000 likes and hundreds of comments, with many tagging their baking enthusiast friends and begging them to make the brownies themselves.

It's the latest of Ms Head's simple recipes to become a viral sensation, following a wildly popular video on Mars and Malteser slices.

She makes the indulgent snacks from 100g of unsalted butter, 120ml of condensed milk, 245g of plain biscuits, 400g of chocolate, one teaspoon of vegetable oil and chunks of Mars and Maltesers to decorate.

'No baking involved, just a lot of melting!' she wrote in the caption.

To make the base, Ms Head melts the butter and condensed milk, then adds chopped Mars bar, crushed Maltesers and crushed biscuits.

After mixing well, she pats the mixture into the base of a baking dish and refrigerates for one to two hours until set.

Once hardened, she removes the dish from the fridge and melts chocolate mixed with vegetable oil to make it silky smooth, then pours the liquid over the base.

After giving the tray a shake to ensure the chocolate spreads to every corner, Ms Head decorates with chunks of Mars bar and half-cut Maltesers before refrigerating for another hour until set.

A video of the slices has been liked almost 12,000 times since it was shared, with one viewer tagging her friend and writing: 'This is what we need to make next.'
