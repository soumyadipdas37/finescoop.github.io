One half of this unstoppable pair is currently filming the live action remake of The Little Mermaid. 

And Beyonce's proteges Chloe X Halle lit up the night during their performance prior to the start of the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday night, singing the sultry title track off their latest album Ungodly Hour.

The R&B duo – made up of Chloe Bailey, 22, and her younger sister Halle, 20 –performed in futuristic silver ensembles consisting of headpieces, chokers, opera gloves, leotards and thigh high boots, all in an incredibly reflective silver finish.

Their outfits, which were reminiscent of some of the edgier looks from legendary 90s group TLC, caught the light on the bare stage where they performed in an eye-catching way.

The singers' kinetic choreography lent itself well to the sexy and melodic song, which picked up momentum as the lights popped and shimmered. 

Chloe and Halle's dangly hair ornaments and earrings added to the seductive quality of the proceedings, as they grabbed their old-school recording microphones with silvery gloves.

Younger sister Halle made headlines last year for clinching the coveted role of Ariel in the new live action 'reimagining' of 1989's classic animated film The Little Mermaid, which will follow Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King as the next entry in the Disney catalog to get the real-life treatment.

Chloe X Halle released their debut album The Kids Are Alright in 2018.

They earned two Grammy Awards nominations for Best New Artist and Best Urban Contemporary Album.

Ungodly Hour has received widespread critical acclaim with reviewers praising their vocal delivery, artistic growth, maturity and the work's cohesiveness.

The album's lead single Do It has become their most successful song to date.

Do It peaked at number 83 on the Billboard US Hot 100 chart and also reached number three on the R&B Digital Song Sales chart, making it their first top five hit on that chart.

Blinding light: Their outfits were all in an incredibly reflective silver finish

The pair performed Sunday ahead of MTV's Video Music Awards bash, which saw Lady Gaga dominate the evening with wins in several categories including Song and Artist of the Year, as well as the new Tricon Award.  

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.

This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.

MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’

Nominations this year were dominated by pop performers Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, with nine nods each, while Billie Eilish and The Weeknd followed closely behind with six each.

They all appear in the top prize category, Video of the Year, which finds Eilish's Everything I Wanted going up against Eminem and Juice WRLD's Godzilla, Future and Drake's Life Is Good, Gaga and Grande's Rain on Me, Taylor Swift's The Man, and The Weeknd's Blinding Lights.
