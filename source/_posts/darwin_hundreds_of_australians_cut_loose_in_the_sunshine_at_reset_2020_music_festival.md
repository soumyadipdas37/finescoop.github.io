Hundreds of people have gathered to celebrate the return of live music in Darwin.

Reset 2020 was held at the Darwin Ski Club on Saturday and featured acts such as Shannon Noll, The Angels and The SuperJesus. 

The festival, which allowed all ages into the event, is the first live music festival since the COVID-19 outbreak shut down events across the country.

Jon Stevens, the brain behind Noisworks, is the creator of the festival and was supposed to headline the show.

The festival, which allowed all ages into the event, is the first live music festival since the COVID-19 outbreak shut down events across the country.

Hundreds took the opportunity to soak up the sun and dance to some of their favourite artists. 

A spot of rain didn't dampen anyone's mood - with several jumping into mud puddles.

Footage shared to Instagram showed one man jump belly-first into one mud puddle and pretend to swim.

Another clip showed a woman covered in mud twirling to the music in front of the stage while barefoot.

The performers were even overjoyed to be finally back on stage and showcasing their talents to crowds once again.

Noll shared a video of his soundcheck for the festival to Instagram.

'Yes! First sound check in six months,' he captioned the video.

'Cannot wait to play the show tomorrow here in Darwin! Make sure you come check it out if you're in Darwin! Love NT!'

Angels vocalist Dave Gleeson described the festival as a 'glimmer of hope' for musicians. 

Concertgoers Elizabeth Szegedi and Jade Leask were among attendees of the festival.

The pair were keen to see Daryl Braithwaite and Jon Stevens, but the performers were unable to attend due to border restrictions.

However Ms Szegedi and Ms Leask were excited to see Noll play. 

'The Territory's the best place to live, isn't it?' Ms Szegedi told the NT News.

Popular festival Splendour In The Grass was also cancelled for 2020.   

Dark Mofo and Groovin the Moo were also cancelled earlier this year due to the pandemic. 

Tamworth Country Music Festival announced earlier this month that it would not return in 2021. 

Darwin Ski Club will also host Jimmy Barnes and Rebound 2020 in the coming weeks.
