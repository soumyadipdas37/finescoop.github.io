Ciara shared a heartwarming Instagram portrait of her '3 KINGS.'

She swung by her social media this Friday to upload a picture of her husband Russell Wilson and her sons Future, six, and Win, seven weeks.

The 34-year-old singer shares Win and her daughter Sienna, three, with Russell, and she had Future with her rapper ex-fiance of the same name.

Although Ciara was once engaged to Future they broke up in 2014 and she raises all three of her children with Russell.

In addition to the '3 KINGS' picture Russell also posed for a heartwarming snap in which he and Sienna beamed whilst she sat in his lap.

Ciara, Russell and all three of the children also got together for a group shot, which the songstress posted to Instagram alongside a behind-the-scenes video.

The photographer could be heard behind the camera saying that 'when Win gets older you can show him these pictures and say: "This is when you were little!"'

Lately Ciara has also been posting footage of herself exercising as she works toward achieving her goal post-baby body.Â 

She hopped on the treadmill late last month for 'Day 1' of her fitness regimen after announcing her plan to lose 48lbs following the birth of her third baby.Â 

Ciara posted a video of the workout to Insta Stories and made sure to tag her and Russell's dashing personal trainer Decker Davis.

One day earlier she had posted a selfie to her Instagram page and revealed to her fans how much weight she was planning to lose.

Ciara gave birth to Win on July 23 this year and announced the good news with an Instagram video the following day.

Wearing a sparkly black mask and holding her baby to her chest, Ciara lay in her hospital bed and sang Happy Birthday To You.Â 

'Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy & Daddy Love You!' she gushed in the caption. 'Win Harrison Wilson 7.23.2020 8lbs 1 oz.'

Russell posted the same caption over a heart-melting family picture in which he leaned into frame beside Ciara's hospital bed while she cradled their newborn.

The NFL star also uploaded a picture of himself beaming as he lay shirtless on a sofa in Ciara's hospital ward to do skin-to-skin with the baby.Â 

Ciara announced her latest pregnancy with a breathtaking Instagram snap taken on a beach during a trip to Turks And Caicos.Â 

The couple are devout Christians who abstained from having sex during their romance until they married in 2016 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England.
