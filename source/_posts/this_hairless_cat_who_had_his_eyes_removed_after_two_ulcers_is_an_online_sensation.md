Meet Jasper, an unusual-looking cat who has no hair and no eyes.

The unique animal, who lives in Maine with his family, has become an Instagram sensation, blogging under the name Jazzy.purrs.

The kitty, who was adopted by his owner Kelli when he was two, had his eyes removed after developing a corneal ulcer in his right eye in November 2013 and then another in the left eye five years later. 

However, Kelli said that he's perfectly happy and healthy at 12-years-old, and his vet says 'there’s no reason to think he won’t live another 10 years'. 

And his lack of vision hasn't kept Jasper from gaining popularity online, racking up 81,300 followers thanks to his distinctive look, Today reported. 

Meet Jasper, an unusual-looking 12-year-old cat from Maine, who has no hair and no eyes but is an Instagram sensation

Kelli told Today she received Jasper as a Christmas gift from her friends, 11 years ago, because they knew she had always wanted a hairless cat. 

Jasper, who was a rescue, seemed healthy at the time, with episodic flare ups of the feline herpes virus, which made his eyes runny. 

However, in November 2013, Jasper suffered a corneal ulcer which left him in a lot of pain. 

The only way to relieve the poor feline was to remove his right eye. Kelli thought it would be the end of it, however, the same happened with the left eye five years later in 2018. 

In spite of being blind, Jasper lives a happy life with Kelli, who said she was impressed with how well he adapted to his new condition.

Playful Jasper is well-adjusted and happy, with Kellu regularly checking in with his veterinarian 

'He does pretty good. The first day home from the vet, he was climbing on the couch and on my shoulder and all over the place trying to explore. It was amazing to watch him,' she said. 

However, it was not the end of the struggle for poor Jasper, who had a stroke in 2019, causing him to struggle to reorient himself being blind, and making him more confused by his environment. 

This prompted Kelli to put him in a pen when she is not home so that the cute feline can explore in a safe way, without hurting himself.

While his lack of eye can prove intimidating to some, Jasper (pictured wrapped in a white and grey throw) is a loving animal 

Kelli, who said she had been criticized by people who thought she was 'stretching this out' said she was in touch with Jasper's vets regularly and had his quality of life at heart. 

She is also the owner of two other rescue cats, one of which is also blind like Jasper.  

On Instagram, Jasper is a true sensation, posing for several pictures for his 81.300 followers. 

His fans often share artwork and drawings of Jasper with Kelli.
