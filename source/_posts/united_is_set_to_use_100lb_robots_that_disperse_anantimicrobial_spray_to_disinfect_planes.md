title: United is set to use 100lb robots that disperse an antimicrobial spray to disinfect planes 
description: United is rolling out 100lb robots at 10 US airports that will help deep clean planes by dispersing an antimicrobial spray on seats, tray tables, armrests, overhead bins and lavatories.

Robots have become key players during the coronavirus pandemic and United Airlines is using one to disinfect planes with the hopes of encouraging people to take flight again.

The firm has designed a 100-pound robot to disperse an antimicrobial spray that forms a long-lasting bond on surfaces and hinders the growth of microbes.

Called NovaRover, the system is equipped with an omnidirectional nozzle atop a poll that sprays the fine mist in six directions as it rolls down the aisle.

United explains that it only takes one and a half minutes to disinfect a majority of planes and is set to release these robots at 10 airports across the US that help during a craft's 'deepest cleaning' overnight.

Robots are being used across the US and worldwide to help limit the spread of the lingering coronavirus.

Technologies are being adopted for deliveries, assembly lines and disinfecting large surfaces that could be breeding grounds for the virus.

United has employed MicroSonic Solution's NovaRover to help ensure cleaning is done properly and faster than human workers.

The spray, called Zoono Microbe Shield, is capable of coating seats, tray tables, armrests, overhead bins, lavatories and crew stations.

United expects to add this latest measure to its entire mainline and express fleet before the end of the year.

Toby Enqvist, United's Chief Customer Officer, said: 'This long-lasting, antimicrobial spray adds an extra level of protection on our aircraft to help better protect our employees and customers.'

'As part of our layered approach to safety, antimicrobials are an effective complement to our hospital-grade HEPA air filtration system, mandatory mask policy for customers and daily electrostatic spraying. 

'We've overhauled our policies and procedures and continue to implement new, innovative solutions that deliver a safer onboard experience.'

The Zoono Microbe Shield works by bonding to surfaces and creating a protective layer that resembles microscopic pins once dry which rupture cell walls and membranes when microbes come in contact with them

The chemical is classified by the EPA as Category IV, which is the lowest level of toxicity.

But an EPA spokesperson told ABC News that the spray is only deemed safe and effective against mold, mildew and algae and has not approved 'any residual or long lasting efficacy claims for this product.'

The NovaRover moves through the aisle and sprays the super fine mist of the antimicrobial that coats all surfaces in a 12-foot radius with a single spray.

United will apply the antimicrobial to aircraft overnight every seven days using electrostatic sprayers to refresh and fortify the protective layer, while continuing to electrostatic spray disinfectant to the aircraft cabin before almost every departure.

However, the airline notes the robot will not take the place of its daily electrostatic spraying process that uses electrostatic sprayers every seven days

United Chief communications officer Josh Earnest told ABC News' transportation correspondent Gio Benitez: 'This is one of the reasons that we have complementary technology that we're using.'

'The combination of this antimicrobial technology, along with the disinfecting application technology that we're using along with masks, all of that together provides for a really safe environment on board aircraft.'

 Dr. Jay Bhatt told ABC News that some disinfects are found to irritate the respiratory tract, which could cause problems among those with asthma and other lung conditions.

New York's MTA has adopted similar protocols to keep the coronavirus at bay, as it was once deemed the 'epicenter.'

The transportation group is testing antimicrobial biostats on train cars and buses, stations, and crew quarters. , which are materials that create a protective layer on surfaces and prevent microbes from growing.

Ultraviolet light is also being used in buses around the city, as it has been a 'proven way to eliminate viruses.'

They are also using an electrostatic sprayer that positively charges a disinfecting solution, atomizes it, and disperses it in tiny particles across a negatively-charged surface.

The 'opposites attract,' and the atomized disinfecting solution spreads out evenly across the entire surface, even hard-to-reach areas.'
