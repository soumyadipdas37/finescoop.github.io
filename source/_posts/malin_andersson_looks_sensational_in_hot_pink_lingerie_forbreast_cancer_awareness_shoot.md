She uses her platform to promote body confidence.

And Malin Andersson showcased her incredible figure as she posed for a Boohoo campaign in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.   

The former Love Island star, 27, exuded confidence as she worked her angles on the set in Manchester.

Malin put her curves on display as she went braless in a cropped pink top that also offered a look at her tattoos. 

The reality starlet put her peachy derriere in the spotlight in a thong, and stayed barefoot. 

Malin completed the look with a delicate necklace and anklet, with a myriad of silver rings. 

The mental health advocate later took to Instagram to share a hilarious clip dancing around in the underwear set that she captioned: 'I'M A SUPER FREAK.'

Breast Cancer Awareness is a cause close to Malin's heart, as her mother Consy sadly died from the disease in 2017. Her father passed away from skin cancer 26 years ago.

Malin - who also lost her daughter Consy at four weeks old last year - has spoken candidly about her experience with grief. 

Earlier this year, Malin said she struggles to get her head around things sometimes.

She penned: 'I tend to get angry when grief comes into play. I ask why baby was taken too. 

'Then I get myself into a mess and have to reframe my mind again. The anger is just one of many emotions that stems from it. 

'This is what I mean. Grief is one HUGE mess that can't ever be tidied away properly, it's like when you hide all your s**t under the bed, for it to build up before you have to do an entire spring clean. That is grief.

'If you feel like me today, allow yourself to feel it. Feel through it all. For whoever you have lost is also there right beside you feeling it with you.

'This life can be unfair and difficult at times.. but we should look up to the stars at what we are thankful for. Perspective. I know I'll see them again.'
