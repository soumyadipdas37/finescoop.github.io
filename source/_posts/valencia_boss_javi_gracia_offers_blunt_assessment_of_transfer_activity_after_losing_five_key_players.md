New Valencia manager Javi Gracia has offered a blunt assessment of his club's transfer window so far as he admitted he has a 'weaker squad'.

The former Watford boss was announced at Valencia back in July as he signed a two-year deal with the Spanish side.

Since his arrival, the club have lost five of their key players and not spent any money so far as they dealt with the financial hardships enforced on them by the coronavirus pandemic.

Valencia have lost five of their key players so far, including Rodrigo (pictured) joining Leeds

The Spanish side also sold winger Ferran Torres to Manchester City earlier in the window

Star striker Rodrigo left for Leeds United, whilst Ferran Torres joined Manchester City leaving two huge pair of attacking boots to fill. 

Central midfield duo Daniel Parejo and Francis Coquelin also departed the club as well as long-standing defender Ezequiel Garay. 

'The squad is weakened, as everyone can see,' Gracia admitted ahead of the new LaLiga season.

Gracia was told he would be able to sign replacements but none have arrived at the Mestella

'Five important players have left, and we are hoping for replacements who I was told would be coming in before I joined. 

'But none have arrived and we are starting the season.' 

Manchester United's Andreas Periera and Arsenal's Matteo Guendouzi have been linked with a move to the Spanish side but there have been no concrete steps made for any incomings at the Mestalla.
