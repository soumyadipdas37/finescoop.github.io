MotoGP star Miguel Olivieira is engaged to his step-sister, who he has known since they were both 13, his father has revealed.  

Olivieira's father Paulo announced on Saturday that his son is to wed Andreia Pimenta, 24, the daughter of his second wife. 

The couple have known each other since they were 13 years old and had a secret relationship for 11 years before announcing their relationship in 2019.

Paulo told Marca: 'I'm happy that my son is getting married to the woman of his life.'

The rider, who made history by winning his first Portuguese MotoGP victory last weekend, opened up recently about falling in love with his step-sister and his plans to marry her.  

Speaking to Manuel Luis Goucha, Olivieira said: 'Before love there was a great friendship. We grew up together.

'At some point we realized that it was more than a friendship, it is a very strong love.

'We were going to get married this year, but that weekend I had a race and we had to postpone it next year.'

The news of the couple's nuptials comes around a week after Olivieira won the MotoGP prize at the Styria Grand Prix for the first time in the history of Portuguese motorcycling.   

After the race, he said: 'Just screaming and pure joy to have done it finally.

'I saw this coming already quite a few races ago.

'I felt we had the potential to do it, so finally to be able to do it is a huge boost to be able to continue like this.'
