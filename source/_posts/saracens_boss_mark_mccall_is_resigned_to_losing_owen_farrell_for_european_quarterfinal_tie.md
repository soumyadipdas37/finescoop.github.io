Saracens are resigned to losing Owen Farrell for their European quarter-final against Leinster after the England captain was sent off for a horrific high-tackle against Wasps.

The fly-half, 28, appears in front of a judiciary hearing on Tuesday where he is sure to cop a ban for his illegal hit on academy player Charlie Atkinson.

And with Sarries gearing up for their trip to Dublin on September 19 their boss Mark McCall expects Farrell to be out.

The England international was given his marching orders for a high tackle on Charlie Atkinson

'I think we can safely assume that Owen won't be available for that game and we will plan as such,' said McCall.

'He will definitely be involved in helping that squad before the game.

'Obviously Owen got the tackle wrong, there is no question about that. You could see form his reaction as soon as it happened that he knew he got it wrong and he is incredibly regretful.

'He stood on the touchline and waited for Charlie to get up and come off and he was really concerned for him.

'As far as I know this is his first red in 201 games for us - it speaks of a pretty good disciplinary record up to this point.' Saracens will surely now go into the only significant game left of their sullied season without their star man. McCall will be forced to pick either 20-year-old Manu Vunipola, cousin of Billy and Mako, at fly-half or shift veteran Alex Goode to No 10.

The England captain's dismissal took the attention off a notable win by a young Wasps side

'I have every confidence with everything Manu has faced over these eight or nine months have prepared him for these moments and we think he is ready,' added McCall.

'Leinster are unbeaten in 15 months and are a superb team and we will be massive underdogs.' Mako Vunipola is still struggling with a back spasm, and faces a race to be fit for the match.

Meanwhile England launched their new Umbro kit which will set fans back Â£100 for the 'Pro' model - the same price as the World Cup shirt made by Canterbury. The away kit is blue. The new shirt will be worn for the first time against the Barbarians next month.
