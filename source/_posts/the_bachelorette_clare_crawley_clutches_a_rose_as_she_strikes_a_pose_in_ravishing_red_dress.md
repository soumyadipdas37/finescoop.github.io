'Two more weeks!!' Clare captioned the snap.

Clare looked ravishing in the chic yet sexy dress as she posed beside pillars of red, pink, and white roses.

The star looked gorgeous with her blonde hair styled into flowing waves and a perfectly done-up coat of makeup upon her complexion.

This season of The Bachelorette is rumored to be unlike any other.

Promo: With just under one month until Season 16 of The Bachelorette debuts, a new promo reveals footage from what may be the most controversial season yet

Pun 1: 'You want Clare-ity,' the announcer says, while one contestant tells Clare, 'My heart is pounding,' and Clare tells another contestant, 'I'm so falling in love with you.'

In addition to filming during the pandemic, Clare has reportedly been replaced by a Bachelor Nation fan favorite after falling for a contestant early in the season. 

Tayshia Adams is rumored to be replacing her as The Bachelorette.

A new trailer for the upcoming season captures all the drama - and seems to hint at the rumored shakeup. 

Pun 2: Another contestant angrily adds, 'We caught you in a lie, as the announcer adds, 'You want us to Clare-ify'

Done: Then we see an angrier side of Clare, when one contestant says, 'I'm not done yet,' though Clare snaps back, 'You are done. Get out of here' before storming off

'Drama this soon, is a little bit crazy,' Crawley admits in confession, as the promo seemingly refers to the behind-the-scenes controversy that started this summer.

'You want Clare-ity,' the announcer says, while one contestant tells Clare, 'My heart is pounding,' and Clare tells another contestant, 'I'm so falling in love with you.'

Another contestant angrily adds, 'We caught you in a lie, as the announcer adds, 'You want us to Clare-ify.'

Pun 3: Snarky announcer guy adds,' You want Clare-ification,' continuing the pun-heavy theme, as another contestant is seen crying in confession stating, 'You just don't know when it's going to happen'

Pun 4: 'But you don't have Top Secret Clare-ance,' snarky announcer guy adds, as Clare is seen kissing a blindfolded contestant

Guy cry: A number of quick shots including Clare crying and a number of guys chasing after Clare, yelling her name, are shown, before the final shot with host Chris Harrison
