A single Australian radio producer has discovered why she hasn't found her 'forever person' - and the biggest dating mistake people make. 

Triple M radio worker Jana Hocking, 36, said she's constantly being asked about her relationship status - and when she hopes to meet someone - so she decided to interview a psychologist on the topic of choosing 'The One'.

'What we basically discovered was that I need to start going for guys who I actually have something in common with,' she wrote in a column for news.com.au.

Where Jana's idea of a 'perfect date' might be strolling around an art gallery followed by a glass of wine and a nice dinner, the men she is choosing would rather do something completely different.

'You see, it seems so obvious, but I just wasn't allowing myself to look for a proper "forever person". Someone I could actually see myself falling for,' she said.

Instead she was biding her time with people she knew, deep down, weren't right for her long-term.

Many people unknowingly do this, Jana said, and pay the price of being single for lengthy periods of time.

While everyone else seems to be concerned about Jana's age and status, upon reflection she's actually happy where she is, sans man.

'I think it's because at this current moment in my life I just feel really fulfilled. I have a ridiculously loving group of (slightly mad but also switched-on) friends, I have a job I've worked hard for, I like my little cosy home, and the bloke who fits into this old life of mine, will have to be pretty darn fab,' she said.

Jana's working day starts at 4am five days a week on breakfast radio, so she's more than happy to keep her weekends free of drama and kids for a little while longer.  

She has previously spoken about the importance of dating 'more than one person at a time' to avoid needlessly getting your heart broken.

To avoid becoming infatuated from the outset, plan other dates to keep your options open and your heart distracted. 

Other ways to 'distract' yourself from that waiting period between the first and second date is to go out for a fun night with the girls, take up a hobby or activity like yoga or cooking, listen to a podcast, turn your phone off for an hour and just 'chill out', Jana told FEMAIL previously.

She believes that having two men at any one time is feasible but any more is a 'juggling act'

'Plus you forget what you've said on dates and end up telling them the same story twice,' she said.

There are some downsides to employing her strategy though, namely that you could be on one date and run into the other 'date' while out and about. 

'I once got caught doing the Bondi to Bronte walk in Sydney with a guy, the morning after I had been on a date with another guy who was on the same walk,' she said.

'What was worse is that he stopped to chat and I had to introduce him to my current date.'

Once you've been on a few outings with someone and things are looking more likely to progress, that's when you'll need to decide who you want to be with.

'I think you know something is real once they have done something that would normally turn you off, like farting or having a boogie on their face, and you still like them. Not the most romantic answer but true,' Jana said.
