Emily Ratajkowski epitomized the term 'legs for days' as she had on micro shorts on Tuesday. 

As the 29-year-old supermodel cut a chic figure around Tribeca, New York, all eyes were on her envy-inducing physique.

The cover girl added an oversized long-sleeved sweater as she tossed her signature chestnut-brown tresses into a casual top knot and appeared to be rocking a classic winged eyeliner.

While the majority of her face was hidden by a blue surgical mask, her eyebrows were meticulously groomed and she sported a subtle smokey eye.  

As she strolled down the sidewalk in a pair of white sneakers, the Gone Girl actress was glued to her smart phone.  

Ratajkowski accessorized her laid-back ensemble with an orange handbag, which she wore over her shoulder, and a gold necklace.

Earlier in the day, she was seen leaving the Hamptons with husband Sebastian Bear-McClard and their dog Colombo. 

Emily has been keeping busy during her summer vacation, promoting her clothing line Inamorata on Instagram.

She was also recently among 100 different cover stars for the September issue of Vogue Italia, which was themed: '100 Covers, 100 People, 100 Stories.'

She and Bear-McClard have spent the majority of their quarantine in their Los Angeles home.

They caught a flight out of JFK in April, shortly after the CDC issued an advisory, asking 'residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.'

However in late June as COVID-19 cases spiked dramatically in California, Emily and Sebastian crossed back to New York.

In a piece published at the start of May she dished to British GQ that 'it’s been interesting being in quarantine and married.'

'I feel like a lot of people will end up divorced. But my husband and I are in a good partnership,' said Emily, whose spouse was a producer on Uncut Gems.

'And I think that I’ve learned a lot about myself being married, for sure,' the Inamorata founder added.
