A  mother who missed Greggs bakery so much during the Covid-19 lockdown that she got its logo tattooed on her bum has gone viral.

Caitlin Jones, 20, from, Paisley, Scotland, said she has long been 'obsessed' with Greggs and was 'gutted' when stores closed during the pandemic. 

The single mother, who is at hairdressing college, said she was so happy to be reunited with her daily sausage roll after lockdown that she decided to mark the occasion by getting its logo inked on her body.

When tattoo palours reopened, the mother-of-one booked herself in for the first available appointment on Monday, September 14, and now insists she has no regrets over the £100 marking, revealing: 'Some people have said it's embarrassing but I got over that pretty quickly and I'm still in love with it.'

The mother-of-one, who said she would eat a daily sausage roll from the bakery before the pandemic, opted for a coloured tattoo of their logo 

Caitlin explained: 'I'm obsessed with Greggs and I've always loved their sausage rolls.

'Before lockdown I used to get one nearly everyday so I was absolutely gutted when they closed for lockdown.

'I was more bothered about Greggs reopening than the pubs so I decided when the tattoo parlours re-opened that I was going to get something to share my love for them.'

The mother-of-one had the idea when the tattoo parlours finally re-opened seven weeks ago and immediately booked herself in for September.

After sharing snaps of her tattoo online, Caitlin racked up nearly 3,000 likes and 1,800 shares - and hasn't ruled out getting another Greggs tattoo in future

The mother-of-one paid £100 for the three inch by one inch tattoo on her left bottom cheek, which took 90 minutes for the tattoo artist to complete 

The single mother to son, Brody, 11 months, paid £100 for the three inch by one inch ink work on her left bum cheek which took 90 minutes to complete. 

Now Caitlin has said she has no regrets about the artwork despite jibes from online trolls that it's 'embarrassing'. 

She explained: 'Most people love it and think it's hilarious, the tattoo artist said to me he was buzzing to do it and other people have said it's iconic and that I'm a legend.'   

Caitlin admitted she initially had some concerns about the inking but is now toying with the idea of getting a sausage roll on the other side

After sharing pictures of her new keepsake on Facebook, Caitlin racked up nearly 3,000 likes and 1,800 shares but hasn't ruled out getting another Greggs tattoo in future.

She said: 'I did have some doubts when I was going to get it and I toyed with the idea of getting a sausage roll on the other side too but I think I'll wait until the dust settles on this one first.'

Greggs began the process of reopening a series of stores in April, after the bakery chain closed its doors on March 24 due to the pandemic.
