President Donald Trump tweeted out a video clip Wednesday of a Fox News contributor who linked Dr. Anthony Fauci to Chinese government scientists he says were 'wrong all along' about the coronavirus.

The president retweeted a Twitter user named Karli who posted a clip of Dr. Marc Siegel during an appearance on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News. In it, Siegel, a Fox contributor, said it didn't make sense to believe 'anything' coming out of China – then brought up Fauci, among the nation's top infectious disease experts.   

'If you recall, this virus was discovered by another Dr. Li – Dr. Li Wenliang, may he rest in peace, 33-years-old, who had the Chinese police visit him in the middle of the night and demand he retract this,' Siegel told Carlson, who regularly defends Trump on his program. 

Trump tweeted video of Dr. Marc Siegel, who said 'we can't believe anything coming out of China' during a Fox News appearance where he also called out Dr. Anthony Fauci

'It would be called Covid-2020 or Covid-2021 if it were up to the Chinese, so why would be believe anything coming out of China in terms of its origins?' he asked, in reference to COVID-19. 

'Suddenly we want to believe it came from a wet market, or from a bat cave? Why would we believe anything we were told?' Then he turned to Fauci.

'And by the way, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield have great relationships with Chinese scientists and they assured us at the beginning that it wasn't that transmissible, that ... 85 percent of the time it was supposed to be mild,' he said. 'Then it traveled all the way to Europe, and the president tried to block travel right, but it traveled.'

Trump retweeted a Twitter user whose account references QAnon and who sent around a clip of Dr. Marc Siegel

Trump has sparred with Fauci in the past. On Wednesday night at a town hall, Trump said 'a lot of people think that masks are not good.’ CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield [to Trump's left] called masks 'are the most important, powerful public health tool we have.'

'And then the rest is the pandemic,' he said.  'So here's the point, we can't believe anything coming out of China, Tucker, and I'm very willing to listen very carefully to what this scientist has to say because it's a very suspicious situation, Tucker. 

'This behaves differently than any virus we have ever seen, and we need to know why. We cannot believe anything that the Chinese government or scientists have said about it. They were wrong all along.' 

The Twitter user Trump blasted out to his millions of followers, @KarluskaP,  wrote above the clip: 'Dr Siegel is so pissed off he threw Fauci under the bus with the Chinese! Holy c***!' 

Her account includes a quotation linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory. 'Modern Day Midnight Riders. There's a reason why they are fighting hard to censor [defame] you.'

The quotation ends with a large 'Q,' whose anonymous quotations about a supposed 'deep state' have formed a conspiracy theory that President Trump has promoted in the past through tweets and retweets of its adherents.
