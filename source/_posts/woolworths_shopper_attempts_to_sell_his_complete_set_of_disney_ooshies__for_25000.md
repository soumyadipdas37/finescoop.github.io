A shopper has attempted to sell the 'world's first' complete Disney+ Ooshies set on social media for $25,000 just weeks after Woolworths unveiled its new collectables.

The seller, from Perth, listed his impressive collectable haul in a marketplace Facebook group for a ridiculous five-figure sum - and he insisted he won't be negotiating the price.

'The only complete collection in the world. I know what this is worth so don't bother wasting my time with lowball offers,' the seller wrote in his ad.

'$25,000 or may consider swap for gold bullion to the same value.' 

The seller claimed he has since 'sold' the complete set for the asking price of $25,000 - but not everyone is convinced.

'Tell him he's dreamin',' one woman joked, while another added: 'Nice try buddy.'

And another said: 'Would you consider a swap for all the toilet paper in the world.'

One woman shared a picture of two complete sets of her Ooshies, joking: 'I actually have two full sets including glitters so can I get $100,000.'

The full set of Ooshies became available in Australia from August 26 and include characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. 

Shoppers can collect one of the 36 figurines with every $30 spent in store or online.

It comes just days after an 'ultra rare' furry Baby Yoda Ooshie fetched nearly $100,000 in bids on eBay, after a shopper attempted to sell the collectable in the hope of making extra cash.

The seller, from Sydney's Warriewood on the Northern Beaches, listed the first ever 'ultra rare' The Child Ooshie from Star Wars for a starting bid of $100 on Saturday. 

The Ooshie has since soared to a staggering $99,400 following 95 consecutive bids.

There are only 100 of the sought-after furry Baby Yoda figurines circulating around Australia.

The seller, from Sydney's Warriewood on the Northern Beaches, listed The Child figurine from Star Wars for a starting bid of $100 on Saturday

'Baby Yoda Ooshies - Ultra Rare. First on eBay. Not to be confused with the normal green Yoda, this one is the baby and has felt/fur clothing,' the seller wrote in the eBay ad.

The sale ends on the evening of Saturday, September 19. 

According to eBay's policy, a bid is a binding contract that's active until an auction-style listing ends or you're outbid.

'You can only retract a bid if the seller significantly changed the description of the item or if you accidentally bid the wrong amount. Retracting a bid for any other reason is considered an invalid bid retraction,' eBay states on its website. 

The ultra rare furry Thor (pictured) will also be in hot demand among shoppers, with just 100 of the figurines circulating around the country

The rare collectables come just weeks after a 'leaked' picture on social media emerged revealing the never-before-seen 'furry' versions of Thor and The Child. Thor and Baby Yoda were pictured alongside the four glitter versions of Elsa from Frozen, Woody from Toy Story, Captain Marvel and The Mandalorian from Star Wars
