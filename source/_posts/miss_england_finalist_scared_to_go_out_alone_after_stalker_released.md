A Miss England finalist has revealed she is too terrified to go out alone after she spotted a stalker - who claims he was once a Britain's Got Talent contestant - walking down the street.

Trainee school teacher Samantha Bumford, 27, said she saw obsessed Jonathan Deal while she was driving after he was released from prison last year.

Ms Bumford told the Sun this was the first time she had seen him since his release from prison and she is now convinced he is stalking her again.

Miss England finalist Samantha Bumford, 27, reveals she is too terrified 'to go out alone' after spotting her BGT contestant stalker back on the streets following his release from jail 

Former Miss England finalist Samantha Bumford, left, has said she saw her stalker wannabe rapper Jonathan Deal, right, for the first time since he was released from prison last year 

She said: 'He was walking up the road, I was driving down it and we locked eyes.

'I was completely all over the place. That was the first time I went out on my own and he was there.

'I was telling people I was over it but I feel like I can never recover again now.

'I'm scared because he's not giving up. What is it going to take? When is this going to end?'

Deal, the wannabe popstar, who auditioned for Britain's Got Talent, claimed that he 'fell in love' with Miss Bumford after she accepted his friend request on Facebook.

He sent her a barrage of unwanted messages, repeatedly showed up uninvited to her shows, and also attempted to kiss her before being jailed for 23 weeks in February last year after pleading guilty to a charge of harassment.

After his release in May last year, he was sentenced to a further 26 weeks after he breached a restraining order by sharing an advert of the show, which he knew she would attend. 

Ms Bumford spoke out last year, slamming the 'ludicrous' sentence and saying she feared he would stalk her again as soon as he was released.

She said that it was only when Deal appeared in court that she realised he had 19 previous convictions for harassment and stalking women dating back to 2003.

She told the Sun: 'I can’t go out on my own. I haven’t been able to attend events. I have no independence and people don’t see that.'

She added that she goes to bed every night wondering whether he is in the area and that she searches the house and double locks the doors before going to bed.

After accepting his friend request, Deal, whose stage name is JAYD, started responding and reacting to her photos and started attending her events.

In August 2018 he came to an event she had advertised on her timeline and posted a liveblog from it, in which he claimed to be 'in love' with Miss Bumford. She was not aware of this and spoke to Deal at the event, believing he was a fan.

Deal’s behaviour escalated and he made attempts to get into an exclusive tent the victim was in for the Bournemouth Air festival, would wait for hours to speak to her, set up live blogs attempting to find out where she was and bought her a necklace.

His infatuation culminated in him following her to the finals of Miss England in Nottingham where he tried to kiss her as she came off stage.

Ms Bumford, 25, said she was forced to shove him away and flee towards her family.

Feeling spurned, Deal later sent her a message claiming 'you only did well in Miss England because the judges thought you were my girlfriend'.

The day after the Miss England event in Nottingham, Deal posted a photograph of Ms Bumford in a white wedding dress on his Facebook page.

Deal has 19 previous convictions for harassing and stalking women that date back to 2003. (Pictured: Miss Bumford leaves court following Deal's hearing. He was sentenced to 23 weeks in jail in February and then, after breaching a restraining order, a further 26 weeks in May)

Beneath the image he left a heart emoji and commented that he had 'fallen in love'. He also included an emoji of an engagement ring.

Deal sent Miss Bumford numerous messages in the days after the finals and her father even attempted to intervene by asking Deal to leave his daughter alone.

Deal had also previously posted an image of himself, dressed in a black vest and shorts posing next to Ms Bumford at an event.

According to his Facebook account, he competed in season 13 of the X Factor with a picture posted of himself at the show's auditions. There is no record of him having competed in Britain's Got Talent.
