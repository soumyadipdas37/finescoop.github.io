Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor featured yet another dramatic moment from Roxi Kenny.

The 29-year-old stunner was reduced to tears after Locky Gilbert kissed Bella Varelis at the evening's cocktail party - hours after she shared a smooch with the handsome hunk herself. 

Viewers of the Channel Ten hit show were left baffled by Roxi's theatrical turn - with some unsure what all the fuss was about.

'You have a rose Roxi, calm down,' Tweeted one viewer.

Meanwhile, a second viewer didn't understand what all the fuss was about. 'Didn't Roxi just kiss Locky like an hour ago? Why is she upset?' they wrote. 

A third viewer appeared to be frustrated by Roxi's emotional outbursts, writing: 'Uh, it's called The Bachelor, not the Roxi Drama show.'

And a fourth seemed to share the same sentiment. 'Roxi is that girl who signs up for MasterChef but can't even boil water.'

Another viewer took to Twitter to defend Bella, who is a fan favourite to win The Bachelor.

'Bella did nothing wrong. The kiss was mutual. Locky was just as involved as she was,' they began.

'Roxi needs to chill out. What did you think was going to happen on The Bachelor?' they wrote.

In a piece to camera on the night, Locky explained himself.

'There's a process, I'm not trying to hurt anyone, but I am trying to find the person I want to spend the rest of my life with,' he began. 

'Roxi, yes, I should have been more respectful of you, but... There's 15 girls here, and I've got connections with other girls besides you. And I'm sorry for that.'

Following their conversation, Roxi explained: 'I mean, I always get over s**t. And I wake up the next day, I'm, like, ''Okay. Like, it's fine.''

Earlier in the episode, Roxi and Locky enjoyed quality time together on intimate date, where she was given a rose.
