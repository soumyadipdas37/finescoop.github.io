Mums across Australia have revealed the secret to cleaning greasy oven racks and make them look sparkling new.

Posting to a popular Facebook group, multiple women said they use laundry powder to clean their racks in a bathtub full of hot water, as it removes food and grime with ease.

One woman said she used the Biozet Attack laundry powder and another said she tried the Di San Oxy laundry soaker wash - and both are effective at cleaning the racks.

'To the lady that posted about cleaning her oven racks in the bath tub with washing powder, thank you! I have never been able to get mine so clean ever before!' one woman said and shared images on Facebook.

'I cannot thank you enough for making this daunting task so simple!'

To clean the oven racks, she placed a towel at the bottom of the bathtub to prevent scratches, then laid the oven racks on top before adding the water and detergent.

In a jug of hot water, she added three scoops of washing powder and poured it into the bath once dissolved.

'Continue adding hot water until oven racks are covered, leave it to sit overnight and then in morning wipe over with steel wool and rinse in cold water,' she said. 

The strong ingredients in the laundry powder remove tough food stains and grease.  

Hundreds were impressed with the simple hack and many who had previously used the laundry detergent said it 'works wonders'.

'Napisan or any other powder stain remover works even better,' one woman said.

'It's the only way to clean oven racks - I also add a big scoop of bicarb to the water,' another said. 

A third joked: 'I wish I could put whole oven in the bath.'
