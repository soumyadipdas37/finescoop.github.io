She may be the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, but some viewers believe Delta Goodrem has overstayed her welcome. 

Following rumours that The Voice won't feature any international stars next year, fans have flocked to Facebook begging for Seven to axe Delta, 35, as well.

'If they get rid of Delta I might actually watch this. Can't stand her,' one viewer wrote

'Please no more Delta!' another begged 

Elsewhere, one fan suggested that Seven replace the Born To Try singer with Tina Arena. 

Delta has long received criticism for her supposedly 'annoying' and 'theatrical' behaviour on The Voice.

Speaking to the September issue of Marie Claire, Delta said she was left 'absolutely broken' by some of the negative feedback she received. 

'I don't think all of [the criticism] was fair but there's a lot I can reflect on,' she said. 

'At the time [of The Voice's first season], being 27 and on TV, my brain could compute that it was part of the cycle. But it still hurt me.'

Rather than letting the negativity get her down, Delta said she has learned to grow a thicker skin. 

'It's one thing to know of something. It's another thing to have walked it. The chapter taught me resilience and made me stronger. What a gift,' she said. 

It comes amid rumours The Veronicas's Lisa and Jessica Origliasso may be joining The Voice as judges, as Seven embarks on a cost-cutting venture in 2021.

The Veronicas are no strangers to the singing show format, having appeared as guest mentors and performers on this year's season.   

The Untouched hitmakers helped coach Boy George's team after coronavirus travel restrictions prevented him from travelling to Australia. 

It was reported last month that Nine had 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'.

Channel Seven's CEO, James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

Warburton already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.

International coaches Kelly Rowland and Boy George will likely leave the show, and it's unclear what will happen to Aussie judges Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian.

Presenters Renee Bargh and Darren McMullen won't be returning next year.

They have been replaced by Sonia Kruger, who previously hosted The Voice on Nine from 2015 to 2019.
