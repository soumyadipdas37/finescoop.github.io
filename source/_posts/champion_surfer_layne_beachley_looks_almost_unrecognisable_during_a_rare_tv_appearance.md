Australian champion surfer Layne Beachley looked remarkably different when she appeared on Today Extra on Monday, via a live cross. 

The 48-year-old was almost unrecognisable with shorter and lighter hair, as she promoted WWF-Australia and it's campaign to protect animals on National Threatened Species Day. 

Layne was her usual bubbly self as she spoke about protecting animals, before revealing her new project to help others.

Layne, who won the surfing World Championship seven times, appeared on TV with light makeup and wearing a WWF-Australia T-shirt. 

She detailed her new self-empowerment platform called the Awake Academy, saying she wants to help others.    

'I'm going to help people detach from fear, take control of their lives and design a life they love through really transformational online courses,' Layne said.

She added that the courses are there 'to help people feel more confident, more centred and to boost their sense of wellbeing.'

'Because right now we're in a pandemic not only globally, but also mentally,' Layne said. 

Layne is one of the world's most successful female surfers, and was inducted into the Australian and American halls of fame in 2006.

Last year, she told The Daily Telegraph about a dark period in her life at the height of her success, saying she had a secret battle with chronic fatigue syndrome and suicidal thoughts in 1996. 

'Deep down you may be struggling, suffering, crying out for help without possessing the courage or the network to get help, but that’s where RUOK? come in,' she said at the time, being an RUOK? ambassador. 

'It all starts with the courage to have the conversation. If you can’t have the conversation with yourself, it’s important to have someone in your life that has the courage to ask you, Are you OK?' she said.
