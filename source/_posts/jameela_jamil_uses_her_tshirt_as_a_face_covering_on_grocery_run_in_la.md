She's slowed down on her work duties like the majority of the world amid the coronavirus pandemic.  

And Jameela Jamil stocked up on some groceries as she went shopping at Erewhon Market in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The actress, 34, appeared to forget her face mask as she used her 'hysterical female' T-shirt by Rachel Antonoff as a shield while running errands in the Californian city.

Opting for comfort, the activist teamed her slogan tee with a pair of baggy monochrome joggers.

The Good Place star rounded off her outfit with a pair of slightly-worn down white trainers.

With her dark locks worn loose, former T4 presenter Jameela let her skin breathe in minimal make-up.

In LA, it is mandatory to wear a face covering in all grocery stores and pharmacies, unless exempt for health conditions.

Jameela's appearance came after she said surviving her suicide attempt seven years ago has proved to be 'the most extraordinary gift'.

The media personality took to Instagram to mark World Suicide Prevention Day, expressing her joy at having survived, while she gushed about the things in her life she now gets to enjoy – including her romance with James Blake.

Nothing that she can now help others, she wrote: 'Surviving suicide has been the most extraordinary gift to me in being able to still be here and remind the people I love that sometimes it's just a particularly overwhelming hour, day, week or month.

'And that it can and normally will pass, and that with even small incremental changes and reaching out to even just one person for help, life really can get better. Please hang on. #suicidepreventionday.'

The British beauty also shared a black-and-white snap of herself posing with her 31-year-old musician beau James and their beloved pet pooch. 

Stressing her happiness in the photo, the presenter-turned-thespian added to the snap: 'I have everything I need.'

She further captioned the heartwarming image: 'Glad I stuck around in the end. Got to meet my two Favourite lads. #suicidepreventionday.'

In 2019, Jameela revealed that she had attempted her own life six years prior, noting that she was 'lucky' to be alive.

She wrote on Twitter at the time: 'Today is #WorldMentalHealthDay. This month, six years ago, I tried to take my own life. I’m so lucky that I survived, and went on to use EMDR to treat my severe PTSD.'

'I think I had one executive producer who was a south Asian woman and she was fantastic and a massive part of why I was even able to start my career in television, because she rallied for me. Otherwise I may well have been replaced with another white person.

'Even just having her there made such a difference to my career - we as minorities do not feel safe in a room where we do not recognise ourselves, where we do not feel like anyone in that room has our shared experience. 

'And so you know I think it's really systemic on the inside where people are just casting people who look like themselves, or whose stories that they can relate to and therefore we're denying ourselves so much colour and so many interesting and diverse stories.'
