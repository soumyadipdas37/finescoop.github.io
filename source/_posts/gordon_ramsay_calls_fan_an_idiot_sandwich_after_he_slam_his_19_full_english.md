Gordon Ramsay has branded a fan an 'idiot sandwich' after the chef came under fire for sharing a picture of his lacklustre £19 Full English breakfast.

The Scotland-born chef, 53, shared a picture to Twitter earlier this week of his new breakfast dish which will be served as part of his menu at his central London restaurant the Savoy Grill from Monday.

'The most amazing Full English.... can't wait for you to try it from 21st September at Savoy Grill!' he wrote, with an accompanying picture of the cooked dish, showing one sausage, two fried eggs, one tomato, a mushroom and three rashers of bacon.

But as soon as it was shared online, many questioned the size of the 'quintessentially British' dish, given it's £19 price tag.

Essex-based Tony Moore, shared a a snap of a fry up made by the 'Fry Up Police',writing : 'THIS is a full English Gordon. Take a leaf out of @fryuppolice 's book....'

The dish consisted of six slices of toast, two eggs, two black puddings, three sausages, baked beans, a hash brown, bacon, mushroom and tomaotes.

Not taking criticism for an amateur cook, Gordon quipped back 'That’s called a Full English Classic Heart Attack you idiot sandwich'.

The phrase is a reference to a sketch Gordon acted in on the Late Late show with James Corden in 2016.

In the sketch - dubbed Hell's Cafeteria, a parody of his own show Hell's Kitchen - Gordon holds two pieces of bread either side of TV host's Julie Chen head and calls her an 'idiot sandwich'.

The photo has since become viral meme, and Gordon has revealed he's often asked by fans to reenact the scene.







Fans were quick to question the size of Gordon's meal, with many upset the dish had no hash browns

Earlier this year, the celebrity chef took to TikTok to brand a food writer an idiot sandwich after she made a 'low carb sandwich'.  

In one of the clips in his new #RamsayReacts series, Gordon shows his disgust to a 'low carb' meal by influencer My Nguyen.

To make the dish, the food writer from Brentwood, California smears cream cheese over an orange bell pepper, before adding seasoning, turkey ham and slathering it in  mustard.

Shaking his head in disgust, Gordon shouts: 'That is not a sandwich. Young lady, that is an idiot sandwich'.
