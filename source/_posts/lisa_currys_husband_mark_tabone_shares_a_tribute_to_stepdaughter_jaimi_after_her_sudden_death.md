Lisa Curry's husband Mark Tabone has shared a heartbreaking statement about the the death of his wife's daughter Jaimi, who lost her battle with an unspecified illness on Monday at the age of 33.  

The Elvis Presley impersonator, 54, addressed the tragedy in an Instagram post on Tuesday, writing: 'As the tears flow and the heart aches, I write this as a tribute to beautiful young lady, who's life ended way too soon.' 

'As your mother and father weep your loss, I too feel lost and heavy hearted. Nobody should ever lose their child.

'You always put everybody else first. You were gifted with many talents, amazing cook, arts and crafts, writing, and your love and creativity with flowers.'

He went on to thank the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'.   

Meanwhile, 58-year-old former competitive swimmer Lisa shared an gut-wrenching Instagram post on Tuesday describing her 'unbearable' pain after losing her beloved daughter overnight.

'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' Lisa began her post, which was interspersed with pink floral emojis - an ode to Jaimi's 'love of flowers'.

Lisa's update comes just hours after her ex-husband, former Ironman Grant Kenny, announced that their 'caring, bright and loving' eldest child had died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital. The family hasn't revealed the exact cause of death.

Lisa continued: 'So loved. So beautiful. So kind to everyone... So painful. I can barely breathe.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself. Her love of flowers, cooking, art, decorating, photography, babies, the beach, and helping others will always be remembered. 

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child.'

Lisa thanked 'the paramedics, support staff and the incredible team' at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for the 'extra time we were able to spend with Jaimi'.

She added: 'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for our family and all who knew and loved Jaimi so very much.

'Rest in peace, my beautiful baby. I will miss you every sunrise, I will miss you when the sun is shining and the birds are singing. I will miss you when the clouds are dark and stormy and when the rainbow appears. I will miss you when I close my eyes. I will miss you when I open my eyes. I will miss our long hugs and long chats. I will miss watching, feeling and knowing your love for your sister and brother, your little nephew, Cleo, your Ma and dad.'

Lisa concluded: 'I just can't believe you're not here anymore. I sit and just shake my head. It doesn't seem real or right. You will forever be with me in my heart, Jaimi. I love you so much.'

Sad: 'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child,' Lisa said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Curry-Kenny family had confirmed Jaimi's death on Monday afternoon, releasing a statement in which they expressed their heartbreak and also asked the public to allow them to 'grieve in privacy'.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement, which was written by Jaimi's father, Grant.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'

Unclear: Neither the family's statement on Monday nor Lisa's Instagram update on Tuesday specified the exact nature of Jaimi's illness

Jaimi had just turned 33 in June, with her mother taking to social media at the time to wish her a happy birthday. 

'Our first born. Really... where have all those years gone! Have a lovely day bubba. We all love you so much,' Lisa wrote.

Jaimi is survived by her Ironman father, former pro swimmer mother, brother Jett and sister Morgan.

Neither statement revealed the nature of Jaimi's illness.

Lisa and Grant separated in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017.

In May 2018, the three-time Olympian married entertainer Mark Tabone at their Sunshine Coast hinterland property.

In 2013, Grant, 57, welcomed a daughter named Trixie Belle with radio presenter Fifi Box, from whom he had split several months earlier. 

Fifi, who had a close friendship with Jaimi, did not acknowledge Grant was the father of her daughter until 2016.
