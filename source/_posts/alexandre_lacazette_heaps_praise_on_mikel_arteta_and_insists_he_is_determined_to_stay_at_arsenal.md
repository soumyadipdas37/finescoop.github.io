Alexandre Lacazette has praised the impact of manager Mikel Arteta and has insisted that he is determined to stay at Arsenal.

Lacazette has been impressed by the work that Arteta has done since being appointed as Arsenal boss in December last year.

Arteta won the FA Cup and has instilled a cohesion in the Arsenal side that was sorely lacking under his predecessor Unai Emery. 

Alexandre Lacazette has praised Mikel Arteta and says that he's eager to stay at Arsenal

Lacazette says that Arteta has helped to 'bring some order to the club' since taking charge

Lacazette acknowledged, though, that it will take more time for Arteta to fully transform Arsenal's fortunes.

Lacazette told L'Equipe: 'He's brought some order to the club, to the squad. He's brought ambition in terms of what he is looking forward to doing and what he has known with what he experienced at Manchester City.

'But it's not a change that can be done in six months because it's a long process, but yes, it's happening.

'Our results after the restart and the victory in the FA Cup proved that we can compete, even if we were playing different football. It did the squad a lot of good.'

Lacazette has been linked with Atletico Madrid in a swap deal involving Thomas Partey

Lacazette has been linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium, with Juventus amongst the clubs reportedly considering signing him.

The Frenchman, however, stressed that he is staying at Arsenal, where he has just under two years remaining on his contract. 

'I'm at Arsenal. I signed a five-year contract to improve and win titles. I've got two years left and I'm determined to stay.

When asked if that is his final decision, he replied: 'From me, yes.'

There have been suggestions that Lacazette could move to Atletico Madrid as part of a swap deal involving Thomas Partey, who has been heavily linked with a move to the Gunners.

Lacazette said: 'If it's true, no, it's not pleasing. But what counts are the choices of the coach and having his confidence. It's him who picks the team, not the directors in their offices, and I know I've got his confidence.'
