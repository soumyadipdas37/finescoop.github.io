Five young medical workers have been found 'safe and well' after going missing in a remote and inaccessible part of the Outback.

Gabrielle Freedman, 29, Shaygun Narula, 27, Haydn Dodds, 29, Renae Walker, 31 and Jessica Kolic, 29, had left Alice Springs in a white 2012 Toyota Hilux about 3pm on Saturday. 

The group failed to meet up with friends at a campground at Ruby Gap, 150 kilometres east of Alice Springs, on Saturday night.

The remote desert camp ground can only be reached using the 4WD-only Binns Track. 

A police aerial search of Binns Track and both the Ross and Stuart Highways began at first light on Monday.

Police said they hold 'grave concerns' for the welfare of the group as it's unknown how much water and food they have with them. 

The white Hilux the doctors are driving is kitted out with an canopy, a nudge bar, two spotlights and a sun visor shade across the windscreen.

Renae Walker, 31, originally from Perth, graduated with a degree in nursing from the University of Notre Dame in 2018 before moving to the Northern Territory

Alice Springs Watch Commander Darrell Kerr said the disappearance was 'completely out of character'. 

'The people they were supposed to camp with are very concerned,' Senior Sergeant Kerr said, the ABC reports.

'We've had a number calls from family saying it's out of character.'  

The five medical workers were due to return from their trip away on Sunday 

They are all believed to be based at Alice Springs Hospital, with some due to return to work on Monday.

Social media accounts indicate Ms Kolic has been employed at the facility as a physiotherapist since January, while Mr Dodds has been there as a medical intern since March this year. 

Ms Walker, originally from Perth, graduated with a degree in nursing from the University of Notre Dame in 2018 before moving to the Northern Territory. 

One of Ms Narula's loved ones issued a plea via social media for anyone with information to contact police. 

'If anyone is are aware of any change in their plans, or any information please immediately contact the police,' she wrote. 

'We are all very worried but praying for the best.' 

Anyone with information is urged to contact authorities on 131 444.
