Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane has been ruled out of action for at least the next two matches with a knee injury.

The German international missed almost the entire 2019-20 campaign for former club Manchester City following knee surgery after tearing a cruciate ligament in the 2019 Community Shield win over Liverpool. 

And Bayern coach Hansi Flick revealed on Tuesday that the 24-year-old's new problem is on the same knee.

Bayern Munich will be without winger Leroy Sane for at least the next two matches

Sane's injury means he will miss Wednesday's Super Cup showdown with Borussia Dortmund

It means Sane will miss Bayern's Super Cup showdown with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday and Sunday's Bundesliga clash with Hertha Berlin.

Sane could also possibly be out of the rescheduled German Cup first-round match against Duren on October 15.

'Leroy is out. Hopefully he will be back after the international break,' Flick said.

'He's got a capsule injury in his knee.'   

Germany winger Sane joined Bayern on a five-year deal from Manchester City in July

Sane, who played for 73 minutes in Bayern’s 4-1 defeat by Hoffenheim on Sunday, which ended a 32-game unbeaten run, is also likely to miss Germany's Nations Cup matches against Ukraine on October 10 and Switzerland three days later.

Sane joined Bayern from City after putting his name to a five-year contract in July.

He has scored one goal and contributed two assists in his first three appearances for the German champions.

Flick also revealed defender David Alaba faces a late fitness test for Wednesday's meeting with Dortmund due to a muscle problem.
