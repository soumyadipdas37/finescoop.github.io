A simple road rule quiz about trucks on roundabouts has bewildered drivers. 

Transport WA posted a question to Facebook about whether a truck is allowed to use two lanes when turning right on a roundabout.

'The driver of this truck is turning right at the roundabout,' it wrote.

'It has a 'DO NOT OVERTAKE TURNING VEHICLE' sign on the back. Is the truck allowed to take up two lanes to turn at the roundabout?'

Some drivers were adamant they had the right to continue in their allocated lane.

'Look at the size of the semi compared to the roundabout,' one woman wrote.

'I therefore believe it is possible to use the outside lane without crossing into the inside lane. 

'The driver therefore has a responsibility to stay in one lane.'

But she was part of the minority, with most drivers accepting it would be a risky to travel beside a turning truck.

'Anyone who tried to overtake must have a death wish!' a woman wrote.

'Yes and don’t try to sneak around the truck, if you get hit you're in the wrong,' another agreed.

Transport WA confirmed the truck was allowed to use both lanes while turning right at a roundabout. 

'Long vehicles often need more space to turn safely,' it wrote.

'They're allowed to use any part of the two marked lanes to turn left or right at corners, intersections and roundabouts - if they have a 'DO NOT OVERTAKE TURNING VEHICLE' sign.'

Drivers could cop a $400 fine and be docked four demerit points if they fail to overtake at a safe distance in Western Australia.

The same penalties are in place for overtaking at a railway or pedestrian crossing and overtaking on a continuous white line.
