Leighton Meester was seen with her husband of six years Adam Brody as well as their daughter Arlo Day, aged four, in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 

The couple is not often photographed with their daughter making this a rare sighting. They were dressed casually as they went shopping at an outdoor mall. 

This comes after the 40-year-old OC vet confirmed they welcomed a second child earlier this year, a son whose name has yet to be revealed.

Family day: Leighton Meester was seen with her husband of six years Adam Brody as well as their daughter in Los Angeles on Tuesday

Adam, Leighton and their little girl were in an outdoor mall as they did some shopping while wearing face masks.

Leighton led the way in an army green jumpsuit over a gray tank top with brown leather sandals and Ray-Ban sunglasses on and her dark hair worn down.

The actress had a box under her arm that seemed to be for a beaded jewelry kit and was holding a light pink water bottle.

Adam had on a blue button up shirt with jeans and sneakers as well as sunglasses.

And their daughter had on a pink floral top with leggings and black boots as she followed behind her parents.

There was no sign of the couple's newborn son. 

In early September Adam told the Twitch show named The Fun Time Boys Game Night Spectacular that he and the 34-year-old actress had a son who is like a 'dream.' 

'I have a new kid,' said the star. 'I have a boy and he's a dream, he's a dream boy.'  

He shared good news: Adam beamed with pride as he confirmed in early September that he and his wife had welcomed a second child, a son, this year

Adam beamed with pride as he talked about his son but did not offer a name or when his son arrived. He wore a black T-shirt and flashed his wedding band.

In late March the star was seen with a baby bump but she did not confirm if she was pregnant. 

And Meester, who is best known for her work on Gossip Girl, was also spotted in early September with no bump drawing speculation she had welcomed the child.

Dolled up: Adam and Leighton appear at the premiere of his film Ready or Not in August 2019. The pair have appeared on screen together in a handful of TV and film roles since coupling up

Happy at last: The couple seen on their show Single Parents inJanuary

Speaking to GQ last summer about fatherhood Brody said, 'It’s the best in every way' adding, 'It just gives you a new perspective in the best way—something to focus on that’s greater and more important than yourself.'

 

Leighton and Adam first sent fans spiraling after it was announced the crossover O.C. and Gossip Girl couple were romantically involved a decade ago. 

The two first met in 2010 on the set of their movie The Oranges and were married four years later before welcoming their daughter in 2015. 

The couple reunited in the 2014 film Life Partners before appearing together on-screen briefly in Leighton's ABC show Single Parents about single parents navigating life with young kids. 

It was announced the show would not be getting picked up for season three in May which will undoubtedly give Leighton more time to spend with her family.
