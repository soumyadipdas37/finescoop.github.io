She shot to fame in last year's Love Island after winning the heart of lovable basketball player Ovie Soko. 

And India Reynolds set pulses racing once again as she posed up a storm in a sizzling new shoot on Tuesday.

The reality TV personality, 29, put her incredible figure on full display in a black cut-out bra and matching thong as she perched on a kitchen counter for a series of Instagram snaps.

The Love Island bombshell held a can of Diet Coke in one hand and wore her brunette locks swept to the side in loose waves.

In another sultry Instagram snap, India lounged on the floor and stroked her pet dog.

Wearing a black corset and stockings, she captioned the throwback image: 'Living my best life at work.'

India announced in the social media post: 'Can’t wait to shoot with @pourmoiltd @annafowlerphotog @makeupartistryby__elle this week!! New things coming.'

She recently returned home from a sun-soaked break to Mykonos where she displayed her phenomenal physique in a white strapless bikini. 

India shared a glimpse of her toned tummy as she posed in her bandeau bikini top and a matching cream robe and trouser set. 

She accessorised her holiday look with bejewelled sandals and aviator sunglasses. 

Her collection with Pour Moi was launched in July after India stated she wanted to create an underwear line for 'all shapes and sizes'.

During a recent interview with New! magazine, India revealed that she struggled to accept her body she was younger, but has found her self-confidence in recent years, declaring that it 'comes from within.'   

She said: 'I'm really body confident now, but when I was younger, not so much. I've modelled for over 10 years and it's changed so much from when I first started off, as the models were really different to now. 

'It's definitely given me more confidence in just being myself, rather than trying to look like someone at the casting next to you. 

'[I feel my sexiest] when I've been on holiday and I've got a tan or when I've been working out.'
