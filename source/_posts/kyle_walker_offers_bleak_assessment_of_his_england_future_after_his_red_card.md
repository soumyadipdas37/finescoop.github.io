Kyle Walker fears his England career could be over after he was sent off in the dramatic late victory over Iceland.

The Manchester City defender started his first game for his country in over a year but was shown a second yellow card following a reckless sliding tackle.

Walker was hoping to pick up his 50th England cap against Denmark on Tuesday night but will now be suspended and, with competition from the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kieran Trippier and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, he knows his time could be up.

'The sad thing about being a footballer, it does come to the end some time and I am probably near the end of my international career,' said an emotional Walker after the game.

'To get sent off for your country is never a nice moment, especially when you're on the caps that I am and being out of the team for so long. I should know I am on a yellow card and to make a rash challenge like that, it's not acceptable.

'I am still very energetic, still feel like I've got a lot in the legs and hopefully I will be back. I'm desperate to play.'

Meanwhile, his City team-mate Phil Foden said he is determined to make the England shirt his own after making his debut in Reykjavik.

After the 20-year-old was handed a start by manager Gareth Southgate, he said: 'It feels amazing. It's a dream come true. Just to make my debut is a big moment for me and my family.

'I want to keep playing for my country, not just a one-off. Hopefully I can keep the shirt.'
