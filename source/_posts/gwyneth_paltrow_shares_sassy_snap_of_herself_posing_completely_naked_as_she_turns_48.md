Gwyneth Paltrow celebrated her 48th birthday with a bang.

The actress shared a jaw-dropping snap of herself posing completely naked in a lush backyard on Sunday.

While the snap delighted countless fans, there was one Instagram user who was not amused - and that was her teenage daughter Apple Martin, 16.

'In nothing but my birthday suit today': Gwyneth Paltrow shared a jaw-dropping snap of herself posing completely naked in a lush backyard as she celebrated her 48th birthday 

'MOM', Apple hilariously commented.

The stunning snap captured Gwyneth posing with her body partially angled at the side towards the camera.

Gwyneth strategically protected her modesty with her crossed arms and bent leg, yet did nothing to hide her envy-inducing flat belly.

The Shakespeare In Love actress looked carefree as she smiled beneath the sunshine with her blonde locks worn down into loose, effortless waves.

Not cool, Mom! While the snap delighted countless fans, there was one Instagram user who was not amused - and that was her teenage daughter Apple Martin, 16

She flashed a fun-loving and slightly amused smile with her hand placed on the left side of her face.

In the caption, Gwyneth thanked everyone for their birthday wishes while also plugging her lifestyle brand Goop.

'In nothing but my birthday suit today... thank you all so much for the birthday wishes and thank you to @goop 's insanely amazing brand new body butter for making me think I can still get my kit off. #goopgenes' she captioned the snap.
