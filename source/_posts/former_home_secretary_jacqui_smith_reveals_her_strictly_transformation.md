Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has shown off her Strictly Come Dancing transformation in a plunging sequin gown as she 'teased things to come'.

Taking to Twitter, the 57-year-old looked incredible as she posed in a plunging sequin dress, with heavy make-up and curled hair. 

She wrote: 'The @bbcstrictly wardrobe, hair and makeup teams are genius.' 

'The glam teams are genius': Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, 57, revealed her Strictly transformation on Twitter, wearing in plunging sequin gown as she 'teased things to come'

Jacqui added: 'Here’s a little tease of things to come! (Of course I look like this every weekend when recording @forthemanypod and that @IainDale [her co-star on the For The Many podcast] is a fiend for the sequins).

Fellow Strictly contestant, Good Morning Britain presenter Ranvir Singh posted a fire emoji and wrote that Jacqui looked 'sensational'.  

 Jacqui said when she was announced as one of the final contestants on the show 'I was speechless with excitement at being asked to join Strictly – and that's very rare for me...

Changing things up: She had ditched her customary boxy jackets (left in 2009) in favour of a sleek new look (right) when she appeared on the Andrew Marr show back in 2017 

'Fifty years ago, I got a bronze medal for Scottish Highland Dancing and it feels about time to return to dancing. 

'I couldn't be in better hands with the Strictly team and I'm going to throw myself into the challenge. Watch out!'.   

She will join HRVY, Jason Bell, Ranvir Singh, Clara Amfo, Caroline Quentin, Jamie Laing, Bill Bailey, JJ Chalmers, Max George, Maisie Smith and Nicola Adams. 

Jacqui was one of the original 'Blair Babes' of 1997, and shocked with a glam transformation when she appeared on the Andrew Marr show in 2017.  

Fans of the show took to Twitter to declare she was unrecognisable, having a new workout regime and ditching her favoured boxy jackets in favour of a simple navy shift dress. 

Her striped blonde highlights and fringe had also been replaced with a sleek brunette.  

Her time in office was marked by a series of blunders, including saying she would not feel safe walking in Hackney at night.

The former Home Secretary also faced strong criticism over her role in the arrest of Tory MP Damian Green in a leak inquiry.

She also faced embarrassment when it emerged that one in five foreigners cleared to work in security jobs were illegal immigrants.

She lost her Commons seat in 2010 following a row over her expenses involving second homes and porn films watched by her husband,
