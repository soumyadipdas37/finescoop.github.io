Channel 10 is currently searching for Australia's next Bachelor.

On Wednesday, franchise host Osher Günsberg shared a promotional image featuring former Bachelors and encouraged people to apply.

While most of the suitors from 2013 to 2020 were featured in the photo, two were notably missing.

Season four's Richie Strahan was noticeably absent, as was season two's Blake Garvey.

Tim Robards, Matty Johnson, Sam Wood, and this season's leading man Locky Gilbert were all featured.

It's unclear why Richie and Blake were left out, but it could be because their relationships from the show didn't last.

Richie split from his winner Alex Nation in 2017, while Blake Garvey broke up with Sam Frost shortly after their season finale in 2014.

Blake later found love with second runner-up Louise Pillidge, but the pair called it quits 18 months later.

'Are you looking for love? Think you're Australia's next Bachelor?' Osher wrote in the caption.

While The Bachelor is still airing, fans won't have to wait long for more content as The Bachelorette is set to premiere soon.

There's also whispers of a new season of Bachelor in Paradise, but that won't air until next year.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
