Kaley Cuoco was seen rushing to the set of her show The Flight Attendant in New York City on Monday morning.

The blonde beauty was makeup free with her hair pulled up in a bun as she wore casual clothing while carrying her dog Dumpy in a carrier.

This comes after the Big Bang Theory star shared with her Instagram followers that her wake up time on work days is before 5 am.  

Early morning: Kaley Cuoco, 34, heads to set of her show The Flight Attendant in jeans and a t-shirt on Monday morning. For her day on set, Kaley brought along her beloved dog Dumpy as she chatted on the phone

Kaley was in jeans and T-shirt kind of mood as she looked ready to take on the week. 

The star rocked a pair of classic boot cut blue jeans that hit just above her ankle with a loose fitting grey t-shirt tucked in. 

She added a feminine touch to the look with a pair of grey ballet flats, as she held a sweatshirt and sported a cross body satchel.

Kaley opted for a natural look, throwing her blonde locks up into a top knot that she secured with a pink velvet scrunchie.

Kaley carried her beloved dog Dumpy in tow as she talked on the phone, wearing an expressive look on her face as she kept her mask around her chin.  

Focusing on her important conversation, Kaley stopped briefly on the sidewalk to chat it up, as her dog looked on before getting in a car to go to set. 

Earlier in the day, Kaley shared her 4:30 am wake up call with her 6.1M followers, as she discussed her final weeks filming the project which she is executive producing and starring in.

Fresh out of the shower, sipping on a cup of coffee and rocking a beanie, Kaley took to Instagram to document her morning.

'I'll never get used to these calls. You can prep, you can go to bed early, you could eat right, you can cut out drinking, you can do everything possible...it's still horrendous getting up this early,' she shared.  

She continued to share that she has exactly two weeks left of filming as she marveled, 'You guys we've come so far, I can't believe it.'

Due to the coronavirus pandemic Kaley shared that it had been a full calendar year to shoot the eight episodes which she called 'unheard of' as usually that amount of episodes can be done in a matter of months. 

She continued to share her gratitude and adoration for her cast and crew calling them her family, also adding that she will cry once filming wraps because it was an 'experience of a lifetime.'   

On set: Girls star Zosia Mamet, 32, stars alongside Kaley in the show for HBO Max. 'We'll find out Zosia works for some terrifying people' Kaley said in an interview with TV Insider as she teased the show's surprising ending

She continued to share behind the scene contents from set as she and her fellow cast and crew shot on a rooftop.

After reading the thriller novel by Chris Bohjalian, Kaley knew she had to make a show. 

Recounting the show's conception she shared, 'I got such a chill and thought, "This could be really incredible if we get the right team together."'

The show stars Girls actress Zosia Mamet and Nolan Funk among others.
