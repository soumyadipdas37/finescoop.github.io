Australian actress-turned-director Rosie Lourde has released her debut feature film.  

And now she's revealed how she was able to use camera trickery to make the Brisbane suburb of Shorncliffe look like New York City in Romance on the Menu.

'The only parts filmed in New York were the drone shots to be honest,' she explained to Daily Mail Australia on Thursday.

'The restaurant that we shot New York for was a restaurant in Woolloongabba, called Corella. It's a beautiful place, if you ever get a chance to go there.

'We were able to dress it, with very clever camera angles and some incredible cast.'

'All of our North American characters are played by North American actors. Besides Cindy Busby (Caroline Wilson), all of them actually live in Australia.'

The film follows Cindy Busby (Caroline Wilson), a New York restaurateur, who inherits her aunt's cafe in Lemon Myrtle Cove, Australia and falls for a local chef, played by Wonderland's Tim Ross.

Describing the moment she found out her film was being licensed by Netflix, Rosie explained: 'I just cried'.

'I was sitting with my mum having a cup of tea and I got the call to say it was being picked up... Interestingly, I was sitting on a wooden pier and looking out across the water and it just felt magical, really.'

The film has so far received praise, with some outlets describing the film as 'Eat Pray Love meets The Holiday'.

Speaking on the early reviews, Rosie said: 'I think that's incredibly lovely and generous. I'm just nervous it's getting to people's hearts.

'They are such incredible films to be comparing it to and I am humbled that Romance on the Menu is even in the same sentence.'

Romance on the Menu is available to stream now on Netflix
