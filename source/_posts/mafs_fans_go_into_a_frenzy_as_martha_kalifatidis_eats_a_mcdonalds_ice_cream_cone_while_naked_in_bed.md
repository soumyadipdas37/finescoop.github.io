Martha Kalifatidis and boyfriend Michael Brunelli set pulses racing on Tuesday when they shared images of themselves while seemingly naked in bed together. 

And now some fans of the pair have gone into a frenzy over a tiny detail in Martha's post. 

After the 31-year-old Married At First Sight star posted about eating a McDonald's ice cream cone in between the sheets, fans just couldn't believe that the sweet treat has gone up to 70 cents.

'Currently in bed eating a McDonald's 70 cent cone and the apple is sitting on the bedside table with a bite mark. Moral of the story... life's short eat the ice cream,' Martha wrote. 

Fans just couldn't believe the price of the cone, which used to cost 30 cents. 

'I can't believe the soft serves are 70 cents now,' one follower wrote underneath the saucy image. 

Another added: 'I asked for a 30 cent cone at Maccas the other day. She looked at me like I was from outta space.'

One follower said McDonald's has gone up in price and that they paid $9.05 for a small nugget meal, calling it 'blatant robbery.'
