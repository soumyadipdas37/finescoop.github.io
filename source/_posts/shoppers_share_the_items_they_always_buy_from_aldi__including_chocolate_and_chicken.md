Supermarket shoppers have revealed the items they always buy from Aldi without fail each week, including chocolate, chicken and a dishwashing liquid hundreds are 'in love' with. 

Australian woman Bronte started a thread on Facebook asking about the items that others prefer to buy from Aldi, and she was quickly inundated with close to 500 passionate responses.

'I'm going to Aldi on Saturday and have never shopped there so have no idea what products to get,' Bronte wrote.

'Is there anything you prefer to get from Aldi? I'm usually a Woolies girl but want to try different products and see if it saves me money also.'  

Suggestions included the $1.29 award-winning Di-San cleaning spray, Aldi's butterfly chicken and the discount supermarket's 'delicious' chocolate range.

'My absolute favourite thing to buy from Aldi right now is the Aldi dip,' one commenter posted.

'Omg, it's delicious.' 

The Mediterranean Delite Garlic Dip costs just $3 and has been flying off the shelves since it launched last month. 

Many use it on pizza bases or in salads, and the dip also works in pasta sauces according to shoppers.

'Aldi's chocolate bars are bloody delicious and bloody cheap,' one commenter wrote (the chocolate bars pictured)

2. Choceur Chocolate, $2.99

While you might think it's a good idea to buy big brand names when you buy chocolate, a legion of Aldi fans think differently.

'Aldi's chocolate bars are bloody delicious and bloody cheap,' one commenter wrote.

'I second that. The block chocolate is amazing,' another added.

The Choceur chocolate range includes a host of different flavours, including honey salted almond, salted caramel and even coffee and cream.

The chocolate also regularly goes on special and is slashed to just $1.99.

'The truffle brie and the blue cheeses at Aldi are particularly lovely,' one commenter posted.

Another added: 'The cheeses are yummy and perfect for platters. There is also an ash brie which is delicious'.

5. Butterfly Chicken in Greek Sauce, $10.99

One shopper said she is 'obsessed' with Aldi's $10.99 butterflied chicken in Greek sauce.
