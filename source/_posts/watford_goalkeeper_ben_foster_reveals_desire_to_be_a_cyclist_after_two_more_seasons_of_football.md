Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster has revealed his desire to be a cyclist after he retires from football.

The 37-year-old is preparing for his 19th season as a professional, and he will look to help the Hornets bounce back to the Premiership following their relegation.

And in an interview with the Guardian, Foster says he has a lot to accomplish on his bucket list once he retires from football.

Ben Foster has spoken of his desire to become a cyclist following the end of his football career

Foster is preparing for his first season in the Championship with Watford since 2006

He said: 'I want to be a cyclist after football. I will give the next two seasons my full undivided attention and there are so many things I want to do on my bike on the bucket list, all of these lovely climbs. 

'The Alps, all of the famous ones – the Vuelta [a España], the Giro [d'Italia] – even some of the mad ones. 

'They have a race in America called Dirty Kanza, which is proper grotty – gravel bike, dirty, camping in bushes. It will be absolutely class; I can't wait.'

Foster was last playing in the Championship back in 2006 when he helped Watford get promoted via the playoffs when he was on loan at the club from Manchester United.

The goalkeeper has pledged his desires to continue playing regular football following Watford's relegation from the Premiership, instead of becoming a number two at a Premier League club.

Watford step into the new season with a new manager following Nigel Pearson's departure with two games to go last season.

Stepping into the hotseat is Serbian manager Vladimir Ivic who last managed Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Foster regularly posts about his cycling activities on Instagram in different locations

Ivic is very different to Pearson, with some of the Hornets' players reportedly likening him to a James Bond villian.

Foster said: 'He's not the kind of guy to put an arm round you, speak to you – 'how you are doing or how's the family'; he's a completely different manager to Nigel Pearson.

'He is very direct and very happy to pull people up on things if they're not working hard enough. He has been running the lads like dogs [in training]. Every single day they are crawling off the pitch, knackered. But because it is a ridiculously condensed season, being able to stay fit and keep fitness levels high could be the difference between making the top two or being in the play-offs.'

Watford start off the season at home against Neil Warnock's Middlesbrough on Friday evening.
