Ella Rae Wise has confirmed she is dating her co-star Tom McDonnell.

The TOWIE star, 20, revealed they're in the early stages of a romance during an appearance on FUBAR's Access All Areas on Thursday, but confessed they're yet to share their first kiss due to social distancing restrictions.

Ella also revealed fans will get to see her relationship with Tom blossom on-screen during TOWIE's new series, which will celebrate the iconic reality show's 10th Anniversary when it begins on Sunday.

Speaking to hosts Bobby Norris and Stephen Leng on Access All Areas about what can be expected from the new series, Ella revealed: 'I've been getting on with Tom ain't I! We went on our fourth date last night.'

She was joined by her best pal and co-star Kelsey Stratford, who also gushed that the pair are 'really cute.'

Ella added: 'Yeah I do like him. Do you know what he's actually well surprised me. It's shocked me.'

She also confessed that it's been an odd experience dating during the coronavirus pandemic, saying: 'Yeah because I can't even kiss him, so I don't know what he's got in the locker! We can't even touch each other, hug, nothing. It makes it more exciting!'

This weekend, TOWIE will celebrate its 10th Anniversary with a one-off special looking back at a decade of drama, and Ella confessed she used to queue up outside the shops to meet the show's original cast.   

She said: 'I was meeting them all in the shops and that. Queuing up outside freezing! I didn't do a TOWIE tour, I just went down the high street.' 

Kelsey also noted: 'I didn't do that. I went to like Amy Childs' salon and shop. I loved her when I was younger.'  

Along with giving fans to catch up on what stars such as Amber Turner, Chloe Sims and Olivia Attwood have been up to during lockdown, the special will also feature surprise appearances from some of the show's biggest stars from the past decade. 

Speaking at the time, Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels and Acquisitions for ITV, added: 'After 10 years, TOWIE is still going strong and remains the number one show on ITVBe.  

'We're thrilled to be welcoming back new and old faces for the upcoming mega-series as the show celebrates this special anniversary.'    

The Only Way Is Essex returns on Sunday, September 7 at 9pm on ITVBe.

Throwback: Ella confessed she used to queue up outside the shops to meet TOWIE's original cast, as she was still at school when the show began in 2010
