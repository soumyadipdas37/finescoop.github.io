Sarah Harris has revealed the true reality of what motherhood is really like in the first few months after giving birth.

In a private photo shared on Studio 10 on Thursday, Sarah is shown asleep while breastfeeding her second child Harry when he was just four-months-old.

Sarah, 39, is fast asleep in the photo with her bra pulled down so that Harry can feed.

A chair with clothes thrown over it is seen in the background, and a bottle of water and some Dove moisturiser is sitting on the bedside table. 

'How good do my boobs look?' Sarah laughed as she introduced the photo on the show.

Sarah said that she shared the photo to normalise the reality of birth so that new mothers wouldn't compare themselves to unrealistic celebrity mums in the media.

'It's such exhausting time,' she continued, before admitting that she felt 'jealous' of model Chrissy Teigan for bouncing back to her pre-baby body so quickly after birth.

'You just can't compare yourself,' she added. 'Because everyone does it in their own time and your body heals at different rates depending on your delivery or the weight of your child.'

The presenter then revealed that she suffered from some mild postnatal depression after welcoming her first child, Paul.

In an interview back in December, Sarah admitted that she 'couldn't handle' having two children at first and was unsure about having a third.

'It [managing two sons] was really hard for me, and I wonder if I'll upset the equilibrium by having a third', she told TV Week at the time. 

'As soon as Harry came out, I said to my obstetrician "I'll see you in a couple of years", I love the baby smell and that newborn phase - and I actually enjoyed labour, which is really weird,' she explained.

Sarah also revealed becoming a mother took a toll on her physically, revealing she suffered from back problems for 'a long time'. 

Despite having reservations, she admitted she would go through the process all over again and will 'leave it up to the universe' to decide if she will have a third child. 

'I'm waiting to feel like I'm done, and I don't think that's quite the case yet,' she said.
