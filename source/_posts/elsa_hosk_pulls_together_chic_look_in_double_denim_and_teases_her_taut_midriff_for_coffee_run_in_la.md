Elsa Hosk has been craving a tropical getaway, amid the Southern California heatwave and the global COVID-19 pandemic.

But the Swedish model has been making the most of her quarantine, which she's spending with boyfriend Tom Daly.

She pulled together a casual chic look Sunday in double denim, as she teased her taut midriff and made a coffee run in Los Angeles, during a break from isolation.

The 31-year-old wore an oversized denim western shirt, buttoned only once in the middle, and paired with some faded straight leg jeans.

She finished the look with a pair of tortoiseshell cat-eye sunglasses and some chunky white New Balance sneakers.

Hosk told Harper's Bazaar back in July of the method to her fashion aesthetic: 'I think a piece of clothing itself inspires me to put together an outfit a certain way.

'I like to look and feel like myself and dress to lift whatever mood I'm in. Inspiration can come from anywhere—movies, pictures, a destination, where I'm at in life—it's always a feeling I want to create. How I dress is an expression of my personality.'
