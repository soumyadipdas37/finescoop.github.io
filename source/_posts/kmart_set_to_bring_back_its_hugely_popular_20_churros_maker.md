Home cooks will soon be able to create their own indulgent churros at home as Kmart Australia is set to bring back its hugely popular gadget.

The $20 churros maker will return to shelves across the country after its previous model sold out earlier this year.

The dessert-making appliance features non-stick plates that can bake up to four piping hot, freshly made churros within minutes.

The retailer's previous model (pictured) sold out after shoppers went wild over it

Perfect for health conscious shoppers, the Spanish doughnuts, which are traditionally deep fried, can be made in the budget gadget with little oil.

Home cooks can expect a crispy sweet coating on the outside, and a fluffy dough on the inside.

Other features include an automatic temperature control knob, power and ready light indicator and a cord-wrap for compact storage.

The new product comes after shoppers went wild over the retailer's red-coloured churro maker, which has since sold out.

'Thank you Kmart. I love churros but was always put off with the deep frying, this is a much healthier way of cooking them (minus the slathering of melted butter and cinnamon sugar after they were cooked),' one shopper wrote in her glowing review.

'Worked amazingly! Plus I made just enough churros for us to try (the batch makes heaps of batter) then I put the bottle with the rest of the batter in the fridge.'

One woman - who owns the previous model - shared a glowing review, saying the churros maker 'worked amazingly'
