With next year's season of Married At First Sight currently being filmed, fans of the hit reality show have asked if the new participants will be required to wear face masks.

In a post on Facebook fan page, Married At First Sight Australian Fans, on Thursday, one viewer asked the question everyone else is likely to have been thinking. 

'When they film the next series of MAFS do the contestants have to wear masks?' they asked.

The post attracted plenty of comments from other fans of the series, who were curious about how such an intimate show would work during a pandemic.

Some thought it wouldn't be too much of an issue, given that the series is filmed in Sydney, where coronavirus case numbers are quite low.   

'Why? It's filmed in Sydney, and last I heard, masks are not compulsory in Sydney,' commented one person.

Added another: 'It's filmed in Sydney. Hardly anyone wears a mask here. We have next to no cases anyone [sic]. 

'But filming for all shows/movies in the last 6 months go into a "bubble" essentially where nobody leaves or comes into contact with others so it's virtually impossible to catch it'.

One person claimed this so-called 'bubble' ultimately protected the show's participants from being exposed to COVID-19.

Others put forward some creative suggestions for how the next batch of participants could stay COVID safe.    

'For some it should be duct tape,' joked one fan, while another suggested 'astronaut suits'.

'So they'll be wearing a sleeping mask (like in the promo photo) and a surgical mask covering their nose and mouth. Should be a good look,' added another
