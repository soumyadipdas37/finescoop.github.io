Former Liverpool youngster Jordon Ibe is set to undergo a medical at Derby County ahead of signing a two-year deal at the Championship club, it has been reported.

Ibe was released by Bournemouth at the end of last season after a difficult four seasons on and off the pitch in which he scored just three Premier League goals.

In his final campaign at the Vitality Stadium, he played just four matches in all competitions and failed to score a single goal.

Jordon Ibe is set to undergo a medical at Derby County on Monday ahead of signing a contract 

The forward spent four years at Bournemouth but was released from his contract last month 

Ibe enjoyed a loan spell at Derby County back in 2014-15, playing 20 Championship games

The now 24-year-old spoke out about the difficulties of his time at the club in a recent podcast interview, admitting he was affected by online abuse and failed to click with manager Eddie Howe.

He also spent time in rehab for his mental health after crashing his £130,000 Bentley supercar into a cafe.

He was charged with driving without due care and attention and failing to stop at the scene of an accident last November. 

Ibe is now set for pastures new and will return to one of his former clubs in Derby County, according to the Telegraph.

The former Liverpool youngster moved to Bournemouth for £15m but scored only five times

He moved to Anfield as a 16-year-old and has previously spent a season on loan at Pride Park 

The forward spent a season on loan there from Liverpool in 2014-15, scoring five goals in 20 Championship appearances. 

He is set to sign a two-year contract under Phillip Cocu and is likely to go straight into the squad for the home game against Blackburn Rovers on Saturday.

The end of October sees Derby travel to the south coast to face Bournemouth, where Ibe could come up against his former club.

The England youth star cost the Cherries £15million when he arrived from Anfield, but failed to hit the heights expected of him in the Premier League.
