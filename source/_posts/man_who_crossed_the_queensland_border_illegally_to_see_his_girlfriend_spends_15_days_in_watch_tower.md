A man who crossed the Queensland border illegally to see his girlfriend spent 15 days locked up in a watch house. 

Dale Vincent Symons, 26, was refused entry to the Sunshine State after driving to a border checkpoint at Goondiwindi, in New South Wales, on September 6.

An hour later, he illegally snuck through to Queensland at another location which was unmanned.   

Mr Symons was refused entry to the Sunshine State after driving to a border checkpoint at Goondiwindi on September 6, before later sneaking in at an unmanned location

Mr Symons was caught on CCTV crossing the border, before being arrested two days later near Hervey Bay, about 550km away from Goondiwindi.

But because he couldn't afford hotel quarantine, police placed Mr Symons in a watch house to isolate for 15 days, 7News reported.

He later tested negative to COVID-19.

In Hervey Bay Magistrates Court on Wednesday, the 26-year-old was sentenced to 60 hours of unpaid community service. 

Mr Symons avoided a fine due to being unemployed and unable to pay. 

Outside court, he said he was remorseful for his actions.

'I'm very sorry (to the community). I would go about things the right way next time,' he said. 

'I don't recommend it to anyone. Don't do what I did.'
