This is the heart-stopping moment a rollercoaster malfunction left 20 tourists stranded while hanging face down in mid-air at an amusement park in eastern China.

Social media footage shows the rollercoaster carriage packed with riders being stuck on the rail on Saturday at Rongchuang Amusement Park in Wuxi, Jiangsu province.

The visitors were reportedly dangling upside down for over an hour before they were rescued by the facility staff.

No one was injured while the cause of the incident is being investigated, the outdoor park said.

It was brought to light after footage and pictures of the incident were widely shared on Twitter-like Weibo on September 5.

A social media user who claimed to have been a park visitor, wrote: ‘Something happened at Wuxi Rongchuang Amusement Park. I almost got on the red rollercoaster that went wrong. So terrifying, [they’ve] hanging in mid-air for over an hour.’

A video shows the rollercoaster, named 'Steam Flying Car', carrying the riders suspended on the rail while the tourists were left hanging upside down.

Two men, believed to be staff members at the facility, can be seen running towards the tracks.

The Wuxi park released a statement on Saturday, saying that all 20 tourists were unhurt from the incident.

The Wuxi park released a statement on Saturday, saying that all 20 tourists were unhurt from the incident. The park in eastern China has been closed and offered refunds for visitors 

‘The on-site staff immediately activated the emergency plan and organised the stranded tourists to leave the facility area in a safe and orderly manner,’ it read. ‘[We] communicated with each visitor and checked their physical condition.

‘The tourists are currently in good health and no one was injured. The cause of the incident is still under investigation.’

The park has been closed and offered refunds for visitors who have purchased tickets in advance.

A similar incident occurred at the same amusement site last year, reported Chinese media.

A roller coaster in the park also became stuck in the air, leaving a full carriage of tourists trapped, according to Global Times.

A park employee said at the time that a foreign object, possibly a bird, had interfered with the rollercoaster's sensor and triggered the machine’s safety mechanism, causing it to stop.
