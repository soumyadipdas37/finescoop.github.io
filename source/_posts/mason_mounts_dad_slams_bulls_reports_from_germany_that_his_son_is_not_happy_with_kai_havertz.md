Mason Mount's father has rubbished reports in Germany that his son is unhappy with the arrival of Kai Havertz at Chelsea.

The Blues completed a deal for the £89million-rated Bayer Leverkusen forward this week as part of Frank Lampard's £230million transfer spending spree this summer.

Havertz's arrival is likely to provide extra competition in attacking midfield for Mount, who played in every single Premier League game bar one for Lampard's side in his debut season in the top-flight.

The Blues brought in star attacker Havertz for a whopping £89million transfer fee this week

Mount's father responded to the German report with the above message on Twitter

And a report in Germany claimed the 21-year-old is not pleased at Chelsea making a new mega-money signing for a player in his position. 

Christian Falk, head of sport for BILD, tweeted: 'Our Story: Havertz is already searching for a house in London. Because of Havertz, his mate Werner can play on the wings. Mason Mount is not happy that he has a expensive rival at his position.'

Underneath, Mount's father Tony replied with 36 crying with laughter emojis and then 'bulls***'.   

Havertz is capable of playing anywhere in the front three but it is believed the attacking midfield role is where Lampard will place the German international in his new-look Chelsea side.

The Blues have also invested in the striker and wide positions this summer with the arrivals of Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner from Ajax and RB Leipzig respectively.

And Havertz's arrival means the west Londoners have a new attacking line-up ready to take on defences next season and the former Leverkusen man is currently looking for houses in the London area following his move. 

Mount's end-of-season form for Chelsea, meanwhile, earned him a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the September internationals against Iceland and Denmark, but the 21-year-old is looking to maintain this level with the European Championships taking place next year.

The Chelsea midfielder has also seen the likes of Kalvin Phillips, Phil Foden and Ainsley Maitland-Niles break into the Three Lions squad for the first time this month, meaning there is even more competition in central midfield at international level.

Mount was trusted by Lampard throughout the campaign having impressed the Chelsea legend on a loan spell at Derby during the coach's first season in management.

He was fast-tracked into the Chelsea first-team and made 53 appearances in all competitions last term. 

But the midfielder admitted in November last year that he is ready to fight for his place in the Chelsea squad when new faces arrive.

Mount said: 'We've had to deal with that during our whole time at Chelsea.

'You come into a team, there's players from different countries and you've got to work and show how good you are.

'There's always been that competition within Chelsea. We're all ready for it. You've got to fight for your place. Whatever happens happens.'

The Englishman signed a new five-year contract at Stamford Bridge in July 2019 and is expected to be a regular name on the Chelsea teamsheet in the years to come.
