They met and fell in love on Married At First Sight two years ago. 

And while they have had their ups and downs, Martha Kalifatidis and Michael Brunelli have proved their naysayers wrong and are still going strong. 

The couple celebrated their second anniversary on Thursday.

The pair are currently marking the milestone with a romantic trip to the Hunter Valley, and have been posting several romantic snaps on Instagram. 

In one picture, they were seen kissing while enjoying a picnic in the garden of their sprawling accommodation. 

Martha looked sultry in the snap, wearing a Sir The Label white slip dress with cut-out detailing.

Meanwhile, Michael was shirtless, showing off his rippling muscles.

Martha and Michael met as strangers in September 2018, when they fulming their 'wedding' on Nine's controversial experiment, MAFS.

Celebrating two years since saying 'I do' in the non-legally binding ceremony, Martha looked effortlessly glamorous in a bridal-white flowing dress,

She entered the restaurant elegantly, while carrying a nude-hued clutch. 

While at the venue, the couple showed off the seafood feast, which included a medley of lobster, mussels, and oysters.

The pair later dined on a chocolate brownie, with chocolate sauce that spelled out: 'Happy Anniversary.'

Michael later let his girlfriend know he was trying to get former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson to wish the couple a happy anniversary. 

'I was trying to get you another present that was from Pamela Anderson,' he said.

'I have been DMing her and asking her for an anniversary message.' 

Pamela was yet to respond to the P.E. teacher-turned-influencer. 'Pamela Anderson I love you. You're my idol,' Martha said.  

The couple have been one of the strongest to come out of the Married At First Sight Australia experiment. 

During an appearance on KIIS FM this month, Martha revealed the pair had a secret split for a few hours earlier in their relationship. 

Martha was asked by host Kyle Sandilands if she and Michael had ever broken up before, to which the 31-year-old admitted: 'For like a few hours.'

She then explained that they didn't even spend any time apart during the split, because they were still stuck in the same house together. 

Earlier this year, the couple moved in together in Sydney's trendy Bondi.

Michael currently runs his own online fitness program, while Martha is one of Sydney's most successful Instagram influencers.
