A man jailed for brutally raping a teenager over three or four hours in 2015 has failed to have his sentence reduced. 

Edward John Saffin, 32, the son of former MP for Page Janelle Saffin, drove his victim into isolated countryside near Lismore, in regional NSW, where he sexually assaulted him.

Following a nine-day trial, Saffin, who took ice and cannabis in the hours before meeting his victim, was found guilty by jury of 13 offences, including aggravated sexual assault and assault with an act of indecency.

He was sentenced to a maximum of 14 years behind bars, with a non-parole period of nine years and four months.

Saffin's defence challenged the sentence on the grounds it was 'manifestly excessive'. 

This was after referring to a report from clinical psychologists which revealed Saffin suffered from autism.

Despite the 'implicit threats' and 'actual restraints' imposed by Saffin on his victim, and the fact he was explicitly not consenting, his defence team still argued he was unable to comprehend the victim was not consenting.

But the fact the victim tried to open a locked car door, and repeated the words 'no, no', and 'f***ing no', would have been understood by Saffin, according to clinical psychologist, Sally Clifford.

At the time of his sentencing in 2017, Judge Peter Whitford acknowledged Saffin's mental condition, but stated the offender was still aware the victim wasn't consenting to the encounter.

In July of 2015, Saffin offered to drive the teenager to his home where he lived with his family. 

Instead he drove him into the country and assaulted him inside and and outside his car. During the assault, Saffin called him a 'little whore' and told not to be a 'little bitch'.

The victim was petrified because Saffin said he was carrying a knife and a gun.

Following the attack, he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.

The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed Saffin's appeal against sentence on Tuesday. He will be eligible for release in August of 2025.
