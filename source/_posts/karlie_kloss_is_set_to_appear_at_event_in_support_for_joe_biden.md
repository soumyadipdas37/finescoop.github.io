Karlie Kloss is pledging her support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The supermodel, 28, is slated to make an appearance on Thursday in support of the former Vice President in tandem with the group STEAM, which is aimed at spreading awareness toward educating people on science, technology, engineering, art and math.

Kloss - who is wed to Joshua Kushner, the brother of President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner - will be joined at the proceedings by Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani, as well as Dr. Morine Cebert Gaitors, Nancy Lu and Adrianna Williams.

The Project Runway personality will participate in an event set to 'highlight the important work that is happening with women in STEAM,' according to Biden's campaign.

An insider told People that the cause is near and dear to Karlie's heart: 'For those who know Karlie, this event makes a lot of sense.

'She cares deeply about the future of women in STEAM and has always supported the candidates who stand for the issues she’s passionate about.'

Five years ago, the catwalk superstar initiated her Kode With Klossy program encouraging young girls to focus on developing the technical skills in the fast-changing digital landscape.

'Kode With Klossy is about igniting the initial spark in young women to want to explore the world of technology, so applicants that show creativity, passion and curiosity around tech always stand out to me,' Kloss told People in 2019. 

The appearance comes at a bit of a conflict with her personal life, as she's been married to Josh Kushner - the brother of President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner - since October of 2018.

Kloss made her political leanings clear speaking with Andy Cohen earlier this year on Watch What Happens Live, alluding to the complicated cross-section of politics and entertainment with her union with Kushner.

'I voted as a Democrat in 2016 and I plan to do the same in 2020,' said Kloss, who has also been supportive of Black Lives Matter, wearing a mask and mail-in voting on her social media accounts. 'I’m sure I’m not the only person in this country who does not necessarily agree with their family on politics.'

Speaking the month before her wedding to Vogue, Kloss said she and her spouse were in lockstep politically.

'Josh and I share a lot of the same liberal values that guide our lives and the things we stand for,' said Kloss, who has also been supportive of Black Lives Matter and mail-in voting on her social media accounts.

Speaking to Vogue U.K. in 2018, she said that the scrutiny over the relationship has 'been hard' but she trudges on.

'I choose to focus on the values that I share with my husband,' she said, 'and those are the same liberal values that I was raised with and that have guided me throughout my life.'

Earlier this year, on Project Runway, contestant Tyler Neasloney created an awkward stir when he brought up the relationship.

Judge Brandon Maxwell said of one of his creations: 'It's definitely "wearable" in some place that is neither Paris nor Montauk or Martha's Vineyard - I cannot see Karlie wearing it anywhere, honestly.'

Neasloney said, 'Not even to dinner with the Kushners?'

Kloss responded: 'I was going to Paris, that was your challenge here. Keep it to the challenge.'
