A 15-year-old boy said to be a member of the Crips has been arrested after police said he opened fire from a stolen car at members of a rival gang during a shooting that left five people wounded in Brooklyn before dawn on Monday, including a 6-year-old boy.

The alleged Crips member whose name has not been released has been charged with five counts of attempted murder, according to the New York Post.

An unidentified 21-year-old who was also said to be armed was taken into custody by police. 

The suspect allegedly shot at members of the rival Folk Nation gang from a stolen car at Crown Street and Nostrand Avenue in Crown Heights at around 3am on Monday.

Disturbing video captured the moment a six-year-old boy was scooped up off the pavement by his mother after they were both shot alongside three other people during a pre-dawn J'Ouvert celebration in Brooklyn on Monday morning

A few feet away from the boy, a man is seen collapsed on the ground after he was also apparently struck by gunfire

The shooting took place as some 300 people gathered for a pre-dawn procession celebrating the Caribbean J'Ouvert festival.

Video obtained by DailyMail.com showed the dramatic moment a six-year-old boy was scooped up off the pavement by his mother after they were both shot during the festival.

Dozens are heard screaming in terror and fleeing after the gun went off. 

The shooting, one of more than 20 across the five boroughs, came as New York City continues to see a dramatic spike in violence with at least 28 people shot over the course of Labor Day weekend.  

In the video, the boy is seen lying on the pavement in a pool of his own blood as a woman, identified as his mother, rushes over and tries to pick him up. 

A few feet away from the boy, a man is seen collapsed on the ground after he was also apparently struck by gunfire. 

Police sources told the New York Post that the boy, identified as Maxwell Cesc-Vinho, was shot in the left leg while his mother Patricia Bratwaith, 47, and a man named Flavian Yves, 40, were struck in the left foot. 

The sources identified the other two victims as Bob Charlotin, 46, and Kelly Barthold, 34, and said they were both shot in the right leg.  

All five victims were transported to Kings County Hospital Center with non-life threatening injuries.   

Five people were shot and wounded, though their injuries were not life-threatening. Pedestrians are seen near the crime scene in Crown Heights on Monday

Police believe that the 15-year-old suspect was aiming for members of a rival gang, Folk Nation

A 21-year-old who was also armed was taken into custody by police

The incident in  Crown Heights was one of more than 20 shootings across the city over Labor Day Weekend

At least 28 people were either wounded or killed in gun violence over the Labor Day weekend, according to New York police

Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the shooting, but NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said it appeared to be gang-related.

'This is a notorious gang area that, you know, we've had problems with in the past,' Harrison told reporters on Monday morning.  

It's unclear whether any of the victims were targeted on purpose. Harrison said that the mother and son were just getting out of a cab when they were struck.  

'It was really crazy - everyone was in shock,' Joshua Kristal, who was in the procession when the shooting occurred, told the Post.  

'The boy, his mom was carrying him. You could see there was blood in his pants. She dropped him, I didn't know what to do, then I saw tons of blood.' 

Kristal said he ran over to help a woman who was shot in the foot and held pressure on her wound until medics arrived. 

'A woman was walking around saying: "I'm shot in the foot, I'm shot in the foot,"' he recalled. 'I was holding her foot. I was wondering where all this blood was coming from. It was really crazy.' 

Another witness told the Post that he saw one of the gunmen wearing a white coat, jeans, red cap and blue surgical mask.   

'People were dancing and hanging out, having a good time and out of nowhere the shooting started,' the man, who did not want to be named, said. 'He was on foot. He came from Nostrand Avenue. He let off some shots.'

He noted that the shooter casually walked away after opening fire.  

Video obtained by ABC7 showed first responders carting people into ambulances soon after the shooting took place - as well as crowds gathered for the march.

Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled the official J'Ouvert celebration and the West Indian Day parade, which also would have been held on Monday, due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

But many people got up early to recognize J'Ouvert - a pre-dawn party that signifies the launch of Carnival in Caribbean nations - before daybreak on Monday anyway.   

De Blasio had warned last week that the NYPD would break up any Labor Day gatherings that flouted his ban. 

Harrison said many residents celebrated with barbecues and playing music outside.  

'We actually promote that,' he said. 'That doesn’t mean that people should come out and start shooting.'

Hours after the shooting, a heavily police presence was stationed on Eastern Parkway, the traditional site of the West Indian Day parade.  

The West Indian American Day Carnival Association is still planning to hold its 53rd annual celebration, but will be doing so virtually.  

Brooklyn's J'Ouvert festivities have been marred by violence in past years.

In 2016, 22-year-old grad student Tiarah Poyau was shot dead through her eye by Reginald Moise, 20, after she asked him to stop grinding on her at the festival. 

In 2017, four people were stabbed and one was shot during the revelry. 

New York City has seen a troubling spike in crime and violence this over the course of this summer. 

Last week police revealed new data showing there were 242 shootings recorded in August, compared with just 91 in the same month last year.   

At least 28 people have been shot over Labor Day weekend alone - including the five in the J'Ouvert incident and a 62-year-old man who was shot and killed a few hours later in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge neighborhood.  

Police said the man was gunned down at about 6.50am while walking his dog on 74th Street near Seventh Avenue.  

About 300 people had congregated in Crown Heights for a pre-dawn processional

The man was struck in the head and shoulders and was rushed to NYU Langone Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  

Police have not made any arrests in that shooting and are working to determine whether it was random or targeted. 

The motive of the shooting, and the whereabouts of the man's dog, remain unclear.  

Less than an hour earlier in Inwood, two man and a woman were shot at a BP gas station near Sherman Avenue. 

Police said the 31-year-old woman was shot in the leg, a 23-year-old man was hit in the right arm and a 29-year-old man was struck in the leg and shoulder.

All three victims' injuries were non-life threatening, cops said.  

A fourth shooting took place at about 4.30am in the Fordham Manor neighborhood of the Bronx, where a 31-year-old man was struck in the leg by a masked gunman who took off on a motorcycle. 

That victim was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.
