Julian and Missé have since been reunited.

The star said at the time: 'It just hit me all of a sudden what's going on... We're taking it really seriously and we're staying home and we're trying to help everyone that we can help. 

'But I just feel like I wish I could do more. My mum is locked in Sweden, I can't help her. My son is locked in Denmark, I can't see him. So I just feel a bit s**t, to be honest…
