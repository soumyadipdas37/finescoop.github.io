Wolves captain Conor Coady is in line for a new deal after making his England debut earlier this month. 

Coady has three years remaining on his current contract but talks are underway to improve on those terms, thought to be worth about £50,000 a week. 

The 27-year-old signed that deal in February 2019 but so important has he been to Wolves' progress under Nuno Espírito Santo that he is likely to be rewarded with another increase to take him closer to Wolves' top earners, Raul Jimenez, Rui Patricio and Joao Moutinho.

Coady has not missed a Premier League game since Wolves were promoted in 2017 and featured in 57 of their 59 games in last season's marathon campaign. 

His consistency was rewarded with an international call-up for the Nations League games against Iceland and Denmark, with Coady starting the 0-0 draw in Copenhagen. 

Meanwhile, Nelson Semedo is due to make his first start for Wolves at West Ham on Sunday after completing a move from Barcelona that could rise to a club-record £37million.

The Portuguese has been earmarked to play at right wing-back in Nuno's evolving style and his arrival means Adama Traore may have to settle for a place on the bench.

As reported by Sportsmail earlier this month, Traore was pencilled in at wing-back until Wolves signed a replacement for Matt Doherty, who joined Tottenham. 

But now Semedo has arrived, Traore's immediate role is likely to be as an impact substitute, playing either wide in a 3-4-3 or alongside Jimenez in a two-man attack, though Daniel Podence should keep his place as the Mexican's partner for now.
