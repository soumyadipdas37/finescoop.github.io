She always looks sensational whenever she steps out.

And Rita Ora made sure to cut a very fashionable figure as she attended the opening of her pal Vas J Morgan's restaurant The Broadway Muswell Hill in London on Friday.

The singer, 29, commanded attention in a pair of skin-tight leather shorts which accentuated her toned physique.  

Wow! Rita Ora looked sensational in tight leather shorts and a blazer as she attended the opening of her pal Vas J Morgan's restaurant in London on Friday

Rita paired her shorts with a chic camel coloured blazer which buttoned at the front, with the star opting to go without a t-shirt underneath. 

She added some sparkle to her ensemble with a pair of black heels with a silver detail across the foot and also through the green and silver jewels on her shorts.

The beauty wore her locks down for the event and let her curls cascade over her shoulders as she posed up a storm outside the restaurant.

Not forgetting to accessorise, Rita toted a large black handbag with a silver chain and donned a black face mask while arriving.

Throughout the night all of the guests made sure to abide by social distancing and safety measures were in place, such as people arriving and sitting separately.

Others on the guest list included TOWIE's Chloe Sims and Pete Wicks as well as  Roman Kemp and Lottie Moss.

Also expected to help celebrate the new restaurant was Alfie Allen, Montana Brown and Mabel. 

Rita is now back in the UK after spending much of the summer soaking up the sun in Greece and Ibiza.

She was feeling nostalgic as she shared a video of herself striking a series of poses while on a yacht during her trip.

The singer looked incredible in the clip as she displayed her jaw-dropping figure in a tiny orange and black bikini.

Showcasing her washboard abs and sun-kissed glow, the hitmaker fixed the camera with a sultry stare.

Rita let her honey blonde locks fall loose while she completed her look with several gold necklaces.

The How To Be Lonely singer captioned the video: 'Summers basically over anyways here’s a memory I found ☺️'. 

Rita had set pulses racing when she first slipped into the tiger print string bikini for an array of scantily-clad snaps last month.

She captioned the montage: 'Little diary of my day yesterday. Tag your best friend that takes photos when they think you’re asleep lol.' 

Before Greece, Rita had a holiday in Ibiza with her friends and new beau Romain Gavras. 

The singer has been inducing envy with her picturesque bikini snaps shared from the Ultima Corfu villa. 

Her  clifftop holiday home in Corfu is certainly fit for a superstar, boasting seven suites, a two-level infinity pool and its own 78ft private yacht.
