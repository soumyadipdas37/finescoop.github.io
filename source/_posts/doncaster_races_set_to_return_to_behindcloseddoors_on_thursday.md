Doncaster Council Health officials have ordered the final three days of the St Leger meeting to be run behind closed doors ahead of anticipated significant tightening of government Covid-19 restrictions later on Wednesday.

Wednesday's opening day of the four-day meeting has welcomed over 3,000 paying racegoers, the first on a British racetrack since the Covid-19 pandemic shit down the sport in March.

But now the return of racegoers to the track as well as fans of other sports returning to events is shrouded in uncertainty again.

The final three days of the St Leger Festival in Doncaster will be held behind closed doors

Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health for Doncaster Borough council, said: 'I am assessing the situation daily against the 10 tests I set out to hold the event. I am concerned that the 10th and final test covering Critical Incident risks addressed throughout the event such as managing gatherings of people, public disorder risks across the borough, will be jeopardised by potentially more people meeting up ahead of any further Government changes to the Coronavirus advice this weekend.

'The current rate of infection for the borough currently stands at 10.6 infections per 100,000 people which I have been updated on today and this is an increase due to a range of factors including an increase in testing and a lag in the test results coming in.

'Therefore on the grounds of public health and public safety I have instructed the racecourse to hold the St Leger Festival behind closed doors from tomorrow.

The annual racing festival in Doncaster welcomed back 3,000 spectators on Wednesday

'The day's racing will continue today as it is safer to manage racegoers on site and with enhanced test and trace, it will be easier to identify where they are from rather than closing the event today and leaving people to their own devices in Doncaster and the borough generally.

'I appreciate this decision may not be met with universal agreement but it is the safest and most appropriate way to move forward for everyone's best interests in the borough and beyond.' 

The Doncaster pilot event had been viewed as a template for future crowds on racecourses and further ones this month were planned at Newmarket and Warwick.

The news also brings into question whether supporters in other sports such as football will be allowed back into stadiums.

Prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce further news on Wednesday afternoon regarding the return of spectators to events.

As it stands, football supporters are set to be allowed back in October with clubs reducing to between 15 to 35 per cent although that could change if there is a further spike in coronavirus cases.
