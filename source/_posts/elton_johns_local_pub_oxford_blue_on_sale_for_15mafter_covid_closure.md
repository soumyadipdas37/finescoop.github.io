Sir Elton John's local pub has gone up for sale after it was forced to close because of the coronavirus pandemic.

But prospective buyers will need a fair bit of spare cash of the Rocket Man singer's village boozer, which has been valued at £1.5million.

The Oxford Blue is just a stones' throw from Sir Elton's 35-acre Woodside mansion in Old Windsor, Berks.

The music legend has been tee-total for 29 years after battling alcoholism, but has dined at the 'fine dining pub' on occasion.

The Oxford Blue - Sir Elton John's local pub - has gone up for sale after it was forced to close because of the coronavirus pandemic

After his first visit in November 2017, Sir Elton, 73, posted a photo on Instagram and said: 'Finally went down the road to my new local.

'Hands down, the most delicious meal I've had in ages.'

He even had his 'own table' at the pub and there were signed photos on the walls.

One Tripadvisor review in 2018 reads: 'You cannot fault the warm welcome. Apparently my sister sat in Elton John's seat.

I guess that's why they call it the booze: Prospective buyers will need a fair bit of spare cash of the Rocket Man singer's village pub, which has been valued at £1.5million

'It was a small table and I wasn't very comfortable. I felt stuck in a corner but I'm sure had I have asked we would have been moved.

'Everything was good. Except where we were seated even if it was Elton John's table.'

The pub posted on Instagram that it had been forced to close due to Covid-19.

It said: 'It is with a heavy heart that we have to announce the permanent closure of the Oxford Blue Pub.

'After nearly four years trading we have been unable to find a sustainable way forward given the current climate.

'We stand with all our hospitality friends who have been affected by this pandemic, it is an unprecedented and devastating time for our industry.

'I want to thank the whole team for their commitment, dedication and passion, together we took an idea and with a lot of hard work, turned it into a gastro pub we can be proud of.

'We are incredibly grateful to our loyal guests who have supported us from the start, we hope that we helped to create special memories.

'We are keeping positive and hopeful for the future. Great food, drink and service is what we do and we are not giving up! So we say See you soon, this is not Goodbye.'

The historic pub - which prided itself on its high end food - dates back to 1829.

It was owned by soldier hero Tom Evans of The Royal Horse Guards - also known as The Oxford Blues.

It underwent a massive refurb five years ago.

Ed Bellfield, regional director at Christie & Co - which is handling the sale - said: 'We expect the property to appeal to a wide range of buyers including those looking to purchase a single asset as well as those looking to expand their current portfolio.

'There is significant scope for an experienced owner/operator to benefit from the recent investment in the site and from its unique location close to Windsor and Runnymede.'
