An Australian home cook has crafted a delicious chicken recipe identical to KFC's famous Zinger burger and detailed exactly how you can make it from scratch.

Chris, who runs a TikTok account under the username Homemade King, uploaded a video on September 29 with all the different seasonings you'll need to make your own takeaway meal.   

'Let me show you how I made my fake KFC Zinger burgers,' he said.

'I seasoned my chicken thighs with one teaspoon of white pepper, one tablespoon of garlic powder, one tablespoon of onion powder, 1.5 tablespoons of chilli powder and two tablespoons of hot sauce,' he said

After the chicken was well-seasoned and the mixture was well coated on the protein he refrigerated the produce for five hours. 

'For this recipe you need to make two batters, one dry mix and one wet mix,' Chris continued.

'The dry mix will have two cups of flour and two tablespoons of salt, one tablespoon of garlic powder, 1.5 tablespoons of paprika and one tablespoon of chilli powder in it.'

'For the wet batter you will need one cup of flour, 0.5 tablespoons of baking soda, two tablespoons of hot sauce, one tablespoon of garlic powder, 1.25 cups of milk which you are going to dip your chicken into first,' he said

Ingredients: 

COAT THE CHICKEN:

* Chicken thighs or breast

* One teaspoon of white pepper

* One tablespoon of garlic powder

* One tablespoon of onion powder

* 1.5 tablespoons of chilli powder

* Two tablespoons of hot sauce 

WET BATTER:

* One cup of flour

* 0.5 tablespoons of baking soda

* Two tablespoons of hot sauce

* One tablespoon of garlic powder

* 1.25 cups of milk

Method: 

1. Take your chicken thighs or breast and coat them in the white pepper, garlic powder,  onion powder, chilli powder and hot sauce.

2. Mix the ingredients together until the chicken is very well coated.

3. Cover the chicken and put it in the fridge for five hours.

4. Create a wet batter in a bowl with flour, baking soda, hot sauce, garlic powder and milk. Mix well.

4. Create a dry batter in a bowl with flour, salt, garlic powder, paprika and chilli powder.

5. Dip the chicken pieces into the wet batter.

6. Then dunk them into the dry batter.

7. Fry each piece for five minutes on each side, on a medium-high heat.

8. Leave the chicken on an oven rack for the excess oil to drain away.

9. Place the chicken on a burger bun with lettuce and mayonnaise.

10. Enjoy your homemade Zinger burger. 

 

He urges amateur chefs to mix the ingredients together 'well' before moving onto the wet batter. 

'For the wet batter you will need one cup of flour, 0.5 tablespoons of baking soda, two tablespoons of hot sauce, one tablespoon of garlic powder, 1.25 cups of milk which you are going to dip your chicken into first,' he said.

'Get your chicken, dunk it into your wet batter and then compress that dry batter into the chicken.'

Once the chicken is coated in each batter you'll need to fry it for five minutes on each side, usually on a medium to high heat.

Chris's chicken has been a huge hit online

'Let it sit on a rack to drain off the excess oil,' he said.

'Add mayo and lettuce to a burger bun and put a chicken thigh inside.'

Chris said the colour of the chicken is slightly different to KFC's one but it still tastes 'pretty damn good'.

Many of his followers said it actually looked 'better' than the popular takeaway chain.

'I actually work there and this is a very accurate recipe,' said one woman.

'This looks so good. I definitely need to try it,' said another.
