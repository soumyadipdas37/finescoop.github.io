With our everyday lives becoming increasingly stressful, a peaceful night's sleep is easier said than done and many of us may struggle to switch off.

If you find it hard to still your mind at night then a pillow spray filled with lavender and chamomile essential oils could be an effective way to restore a sense of calm and aid a restful night's sleep. 

Many tired Amazon shoppers have found comfort in the Feather & Down Sweet Dream Pillow Spray. The hit product, which has an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon, has been hailed a 'godsend', with shoppers calling it 'bliss in a bottle'.

The £5.60  Feather & Down Sweet Dream Pillow Spray is being hailed as a 'godsend' with shoppers raving about how it helps them sleep better 

Did you know that lavender is proven to react with neurotransmitters in the brain which work to reduce restlessness? 

Packed with an infusion of lavender and chamomile essential oils, the Feather & Down Sweet Dream Pillow Spray is a natural way to create a sense of calm and relaxation. Just spritz on your pillow and around your bedroom to create an oasis of calm. 

While there certainly isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to sleep, a small tweak like a pillow spray is an affordable starting point. 

In fact, many of the reviewers swear by the calming blend to help them relax, even going as far as to claim it helps them nod off quicker and have a deeper sleep. 

'Helps me fall asleep a lot quicker!' wrote one delighted shopper. 'I didn't expect this pillow spray to help me much but it honestly has helped me fall asleep a lot quicker. It also smells amazing, too, and is defo worth it for the price compared to some of these other expensive brands.'

Another reviewer added: 'Works very well, smells amazing, helped me relax so much and I'm able to actually sleep all the way through the night.'

 'This has definitely made a difference to my quality and length of sleep. I sleep deeper and longer,' wrote one shopper. 'For the first time in a very long time, I'm waking up feeling refreshed.'

Another added: 'Absolutely amazing product, bought for my daughter as she was having trouble getting off to sleep and it worked like magic, so good I had a go, also helped with my headache, can't fault this.'
