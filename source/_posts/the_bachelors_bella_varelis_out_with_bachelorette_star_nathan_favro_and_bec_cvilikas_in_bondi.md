The pair were accompanied by fellow Bachelor reject Bec Cvilikas, 25, who chatted happily to Nathan, 25, as the trio walked down the street.

'Nathan and I are just good mates,' she replied. 

She went on to explain that she'd asked Nathan to come over with his puppy, but he had a few too many glasses of wine and slept on the couch.

Earlier in the day, Bella hinted she could be Australia's next Bachelorette after getting her heart broken during The Bachelor finale.   

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, the Bachelor runner-up confessed she'd love to be cast on the reality show. 

'Yeah, I mean, what a way to get your happily ever after!' she said.   

Bella was left shell-shocked during Thursday's Bachelor finale when Locky Gilbert, 31, told both her and love rival Irena Srbinovska he loved them - only to dump her.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'

Instead, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with nurse Irena Srbinovska.

What's next? Bella has hinted she could be Australia's next Bachelorette after getting her heart broken during The Bachelor finale
