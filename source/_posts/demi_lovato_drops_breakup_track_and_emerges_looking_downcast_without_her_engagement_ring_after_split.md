'Demi's feeling a sense of relief after seeing Max's true colors,' a source told the publication. 'She's in a really good place and already jumping right back into work and spending time with friends and family.' 

In her new ballad, Demi sings: 'I'm a mess and I'm still broken, but I'm finding my way back. And it feels like someone stolen all the light I ever had.'

She goes on to sing that it 'hurts to breathe' and 'I don't have much but at least I still have me.' 

TMZ reported that Demi's team is 'scrambling' to get the song on various platforms for fans to purchase the tune and 'streaming numbers can be collected.'

Over: Demi was not wearing her engagement ring

The Cool For The Summer songstress ended her two-month engagement to her Young and The Restless beau just last week.

'It was very hurtful to Demi when she realized that Max's intentions weren't genuine,' a source told PEOPLE magazine. 'Breaking off the engagement was not an easy decision.

'It was hard for Demi to admit she made a mistake when it came to Max.' 

The couple were reportedly 'having conflicts' nearly two months after he proposed, and only six short months into their relationship.

Growing apart: When Max headed to Atlanta, Georgia to film a new movie titled Southern Gospel, distance  also took a toll on their relationship; seen in 2018

'Demi and Max were basically together 24/7 for months,' an insider told PEOPLE after the couple quarantined together during the onset of the global pandemic. 'They lived in a bubble with zero stress and everything was just fun.'

When Max headed to Atlanta, Georgia to film a new movie titled Southern Gospel, distance also took a toll on their relationship.

'Max shot up in fame, and it's been hard,' the source said. 'He got wrapped up in [Hollywood].'

An insider told US that Max was 'blindsided by his fiancee' and he's still trying to figure out exactly what happened.

'Max just went through a major breakup, he is heartbroken,' a source said. 'He’s not responding to friends again and he is in a fragile state. The posts he is making are not painting a picture of who Max really is.'
