The WAP music video has garnered over 182m views in the month since it was released, breaking Youtube records along the way. 

But not every scene was as easy to film as it may have looked, as Megan Thee Stallion was clearly nervous to film with live snakes and took two shots of Dusse cognac before greeting them. 

Cardi B dropped part one of the video's behind the scenes series on Youtube, on Wednesday. 

Liquid courage: Megan Thee Stallion was clearly nervous to film with live snakes in the WAP music video and said took two shots of Dusse before greeting them in the behind the scenes video released Wednesday

Once ready to film, Megan (born Megan Pete) struggled with the snakes they used to film one of the scenes. 

She spoke to friends in the greenroom, saying that she had to take two shots of the cognac to get ready for the interaction with the snakes. 

'They got a big m*****r*****r out there, 120 pounds and d**n near 20 feet long,' Megan said while clad in a white bathrobe, referring to the Albino Burmese Python that was among the other snakes that were filmed.

She then tells Cardi while passing in the hallway 'It was scary...The snakes big as s***.'

 Icy sand: The sand they filmed on seemed to be cold as Cardi seemed more concerned about the temperature of the sand than the snakes themselves

The video was shot the same month in West Hollywood, CA in the middle of pandemic lockdowns. 

Cardi notably spent $100k on coronavirus testing and 'everybody on the shoot had to get tested for coronavirus,' the Bronx-born beauty told i-D in a new interview last month. 

While Los Angeles temporarily had a partial reopening after months of lockdown and safer-at-home measures, the BTSA shows that at least part of the video was short during the reopening period. 

'Day 1' of the video shoot was noted to be '5 days before the Governor closes California,' in shots from elaborate and detailed set, 'Los Angles was on the cusp of closing.'

Close call: Cardi notably spent $100k on coronavirus testing and the video shows the shoot started five days before California's Governor closed the state and while Los Angeles was on the verge of a second lockdown in July

Cameos: While Kylie Jenner's cameo wasn't recorded in part one, fans had the chance to see Normani, Rosalia, Mulatto, Sukihana and Rubi Rose film their scenes on green screen 

Sweet: The WAP collaborators also spoke over video chat at one point with Megan telling Cardi 'You're so f*****g sweet. I wish people knew how you really was in real life' 

Thank you: Megan went on to thank the rapper for 'blowing my mind and even considering putting me on the d*** song'

It also received the most first week streams ever and became the most streamed track of 2020 on Spotify and the most streamed song of the week on Youtube the week of its release.
