The Carabao Cup fourth round gets started with Tottenham hosting London rivals Chelsea following a weekend where both sides had contrasting emotions from their respective Premier League draws.

Spurs were left fuming after a highly controversial penalty in stoppage time against Newcastle denied them a deserved three points, and they head into the cup tie with the headache of another match in the Europa League taking place on Thursday.

Frank Lampard's team meanwhile bounced back from 3-0 down at West Bromwich Albion to draw 3-3 and will now hope to take advantage of Spurs' squad selection issues to seal progress to the quarter-finals.

Sportsmail will provide live EFL Cup coverage of the London derby Tottenham vs Chelsea including score, lineups and build-up.
