He became engaged to fiancée Laura Byrne in April 2019.

And now former Bachelor star Matty 'J' Johnson has shared some details about their upcoming wedding. 

The 33-year-old appeared on The Wedding Digest podcast this week and revealed that not only is he in charge of planning the nuptials, but he'll be a 'blubbering mess' on their big day. 

Spilling the beans! The Bachelor's Matty 'J' Johnson shared intimate details of his upcoming wedding to fiancée Laura Byrne on a wedding podcast this week - and admitted he'll be a 'blubbering mess' on their big day (pictured together)

'I used to work in events before The Bachelor,' Matty said. 

'I like to fancy myself as someone who knows what they're doing when it comes to organising a gig. So I was like, "babe, don't worry. I've got this!"  

He said that they thought they were going to tie the knot this year, but failed to plan anything before COVID-19 hit.

'I'm going to say it's down to the fact that I'm very unorganised that we didn't, but it kind of worked out in our favour though, because if we had planned to get married this year, then those plans would have been absolutely obliterated because of COVID,' Matty said. 

He said the pair are hoping to have a wedding where they can see the water or the beach and are tossing up locations including Byron Bay or North Stradbroke Island in Queensland.   

They're now hoping to tie the knot at the end of next year, and their little girl, Marlie-Mae, one, will be a flower girl. 

'I think she'll be old enough to be able to take on the responsibility of being flower girl. I'm going to be a blubbering mess. I get, I get a little bit emotional,' Matty said.

In terms of budgets, Matty said they're looking to splash out $40,000 to $60,000 on a wedding.   

They don't want to spend anymore, because they'd rather 'spend that kind of money going towards our first home as opposed to throwing it away on just one night.'   

Matty and Laura met and fell in love on the set of The Bachelor exactly three years ago.

And on Monday, they celebrated their third anniversary. 

Matty, 33, posted two photos - one showing the couple on the show, and one now, with their daughter, Marlie-Mae, one.

The former reality star wrote in the caption: 'I'll be honest, we both kinda forgot the finale happened three years ago today.'

'I blame the fact that we're still so disgustingly in love with each other it's made our memories slightly hazy... and the fact that we're battling extreme parental fatigue'. 

They became engaged in April 2019 and welcomed their daughter Marlie-May in June last year.
