A hungry toddler who learned how to make cookies with his grandma last week is going viral for a funny video that shows him sampling every single ingredient.

Two-year-old Cade and his nana, Cindy Hunt, baked the cookies with butter, sugar, flour, and eggs — and every step of the way, a very impatient Cade dipped his hand in the bowl and pulled out a fistful of ingredients, stuffing them quickly into his mouth.

In a video that's been viewed 400,000 times on Instagram, Nana desperately tries to get Cade to stop scarfing down the raw ingredients, but the little boy has some very quick hands and a whole lot of determination.

Little chef! Two-year-old Cade is going viral for a video in which he bakes cookies with his grandmother

Got a taste for it! The hungry toddler wants to try every ingredient as he goes

Nom nom: He dips his hand into the bowl to grab a fistful every time they add an ingredient

Stop that! His grandmother struggles with him every step of the way

Nana naturally takes charge in the baking process, and starts off by unwrapping a stick of butter and telling Cade he can put in in the bowl. 

'No eating the butter though,' she tells him.

Despite the warning, Cade drops the butter in the bowl — and then quickly dips his hand back in to pull some out and stuff it in his mouth, while Nana pulls the bowl away laughing.

After they measure out the sugar, Cade once again pulls some out. In fact, Nana only turns around for a second to grab the next ingredient when Cade dips his hand back in yet again, pulling out whatever he can get.

They manage to pack brown sugar into a measuring cup before Cade lifts the whole thing to his mouth to take a link. 

She continues to laugh as she pulls away the bowl time and time again, while Cade determinedly goes for more and more fistfuls.

That can't be good! He tastes the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar

Not fast enough! His grandma tries to hold him back, but he is too fast

Fun times! He makes more and more of a mess throughout the process

Yuck! He even dips his hands in after they add raw egg and takes a taste

Now that's just silly! After adding the flour, he dunks a hand in and puts some in his mouth

He even takes a taste of the flour and eggs, and only makes a face and says 'yucky' when he tastes the baking soda.

After eating the raw oats and chocolate chips, Cade is a mess as Nana rolls balls of dough.  

Incredibly, he still has an appetite when the cookies come out — but this time, he shares, offering a baked cookie to his grandma to eat, too.

Incredibly, this wasn't Cade's first time cooking, nor was it his first time sampling his way through the recipe. 

Previous videos on his Instagram page, Little Chef Cade, show him cooking in the kitchen with his mom, Christy Hagedorn.

Learning a lesson! He says 'yucky' after tasting the baking soda

That would hurt! Luckily, he doesn't put the spoonful of cinnamon in his mouth

Clean up will be fun! The oats fly everywhere as he takes a grab at them

All done! He gives his grandma a high-five when they finish and still has an appetite when the cookies are done

In the first video on the page, Christy and Cade make pizza together — and right from the beginning, Cade grabbed a huge block of mozzarella meant for shredding and took a bite right out of the top.

He also grabbed a chunk of dough and a pile of shredded cheese, and dunked his hand in the tomato sauce before putting his fingers in his mouth.

He has sampled several times of batter, shoving his hands swiftly into the bowl while his mom struggled to stop him.

Christy told PopSugar that she started cooking with her son at the beginning of quarantine and recording the process for loved ones.

'We initially only sent the videos to our family, but then posted one on Facebook and our friends seemed to really enjoy it,' she said. 'He loves to cook and make a mess.'  

Savory, too! His mom Christy told PopSugar that she started cooking with her son at the beginning of quarantine and recording the process for loved ones 

Mama mia! While making pizza, he sampled the cheese, the dough, and the toppings 

'We initially only sent the videos to our family, but then posted one on Facebook and our friends seemed to really enjoy it,' she said. 'He loves to cook and make a mess.'
