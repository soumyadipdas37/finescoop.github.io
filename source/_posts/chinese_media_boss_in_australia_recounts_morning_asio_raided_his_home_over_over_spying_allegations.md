Yang Jingzhong, former head of Sydney's Xinhua News Agency bureau, was among a group of people targeted in a joint operation by the Federal Police and ASIO on the morning of June 26

A Chinese state media journalist who was raided by ASIO has recounted what happened on the day spooks busted through his door in front of his child.

Yang Jingzhong and three others were targeted as part of an investigation probing an alleged Chinese influence campaign centred around NSW Labor MP Shaoquett Moselmane. 

It is the first time the former head of Sydney's Xinhua News Agency bureau, has commented on the incident since Daily Mail Australia first broke the story on September 17. 

'At about 6:30 in the morning on June 26, I was still asleep, and suddenly there was a heavy knock on the door,' Mr Yang wrote in an article for China's Communist Party mouthpiece, Xinhua.

Officers from ASIO produced a foreign interference search warrant, 'took' his mobile phone and immediately demanded he 'should not touch any electronic equipment'.

'I sat on the sofa in the living room with my daughter who was also awakened from sleep and watched them rumbling around. To go to the bathroom, some people followed outside the bathroom door,' he said.

'My daughter had never experienced such a scene and was very frightened.'

On the same day, Australian Federal Police and intelligence agencies also raided the homes of Mr Moselmane and three other Chinese journalists working in Australia. 

The Lebanese-born backbencher, known for singing the praises of Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, told the ABC's 7.30 he was part of a 'friendly' WeChat group that included a number of 'foreign journalists' and his staffer John Zhang, who was also caught up in the probe. 

Mr Moselmane has denied all wrongdoing.

'They searched my apartment thoroughly from early morning to more than one in the afternoon, for seven hours, and did not miss any corner,' Mr Yang said.

'They took away my computers, mobile phones, iPads and other electronic devices, as well as printed documents and other materials.

'I asked them to leave a search warrant, but the other party refused. Before they left the apartment, they left a list of the stolen items.'

Although it's understood Mr Yang was part of the WeChat group, the Xinhua editor claims he 'did not violate any laws'.

In the aftermath of the raid, he fled to Beijing and Xinhua journalists at the Sydney bureau were ordered to stop work for about two weeks and cut all communications with Mr Yang.

He claimed the Australian government 'seriously interfered' with day-to-day reporting of Chinese media journalists, saying it 'grossly infringed' on his 'legitimate rights'. 

Mr Yang also says the intelligence operation caused serious damage to the physical and mental health of journalists and their families, and fully exposed the 'hypocrisy' of Australia's 'so called' press freedoms.

Despite this, he says the prospect for friendly cooperation between the two countries remains bright.

The other Chinese reporters targeted by ASIO were the Australian bureau chief of China News Service Tao Shelan; China Radio International's Sydney bureau chief Li Dayong; prominent Chinese scholar and media commentator Professor Chen Hong, the ABC reported.

Tensions flared in the Prime Minister's Courtyard when Bai Xu (pictured), the chief of Xinhua's Canberra bureau, became angry that a SBS cameraman was filming her

That same afternoon Xinhua's Canberra bureau chief Bai Xu sparked a heated row in the Prime Minster's Courtyard during a media conference.

Ms Bai became angry that a SBS cameraman was filming her.

The Australian cameraman had turned his lens on Ms Bai after witnesses claimed a photographer she was with was taking photos of other journalists.

The news of the raid on Chinese reporters comes just days after two Australian journalists fled China at the direction of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

ABC's Bill Birtles and AFR's Michael Smith were told they were not free to leave China as they were part of an investigation into Cheng Lei - an Australian citizen working for China's CGTN English business news.

The pair retreated to the Australian embassy where a tense diplomatic stand off unfolded over several days before they were eventually allowed to leave. 

On Tuesday, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters Australian TV anchor Cheng Lei (pictured) is suspected of 'endangering China's national interests'

Ms Lei was snatched by the totalitarian regime about a month ago and has not had any contact with her husband and two children since. 

Under China's draconian laws a suspect can be kept for up to six months with no access to legal council or the outside world.  

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian, said the Australian TV anchor is suspected of 'endangering China's national interests' but no further information about the case was offered.

Relations between Beijing and Canberra have been spiralling to new lows as China becomes increasingly belligerence on the world stage.  

The two nations have been at loggerheads over China's human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, continued trade sanctions on Australian wine, beef and barely, as well as the Chinese Communist Party's refusal to allow an independent inquiry in the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beijing are also believed to have carried a major cyber attack on Australian institutions after Canberra banned Huawei from participating in the construction of Australia's 5G network in August 2018, on the grounds of national security concerns.
