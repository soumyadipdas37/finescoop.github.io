Delta Goodrem has revealed how she kept her latest health battle a secret from the public, with just her nearest and dearest aware of what she was going through.

The singer woke up unable to speak, let alone sing, after complications from salivary gland removal surgery two years ago. 

The process of recovery involved extensive speech therapy, with the 35-year-old doing it all in secret and hoping desperately she would recover in time to film The Voice in February 2019.

'I didn't know if I'd make it before it was time to film. I knew I had that goal coming up, I needed it to get better,' she told The Courier Mail on Saturday. 

'I was working very hard behind the scenes with my speech therapist,' the Born To Try singer added. 

Only her close family and friends knew of her surgery and recovery process, Delta told the paper.

Long journey: 'I didn't know if I'd make it before it was time to film. I knew I had that goal coming up, I needed it to get better,' she told The Courier Mail on Saturday. I was working very hard behind the scenes with my speech therapist'

'I stayed at home in between going to the hospital and going to speech therapy. When you have to retreat you can retreat. 

'I have a really tight knit group of friends and family who have always been protective of me. It was a really personal time for me, the people around me knew the gravity of it,' the Lost Without You hitmaker admitted. 

Delta was able to film the show, saying the team on The Voice were 'wonderful' in making sure they did multiple takes when her voice became a little too tired and she 'didn't make as much sense'.

In August, Delta posted confronting footage to Instagram which showed her slurring her words and unable to control her speech following the procedure two years ago.

She could barely communicate due to paralysis of a nerve in her tongue, but has since made a full recovery and has used the ordeal as inspiration for her new single, Paralyzed.

Struggling to form her words, Delta wept: 'I don't want to go out, I'm super embarrassed... I'm super embarrassed, I'm just over it! I'm just trying to stay positive.

'My livelihood is my sound... I'm trying to decide whether this is getting any better or not. It doesn't feel like it.' 

Delta had kept the surgery a secret until August, deciding to announce it on Instagram as a way of explaining why she had not released new music. 

It's Delta's second major health battle after she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 18 in July 2003.
