Lautaro Martinez's future is at Inter Milan, insists the club's vice-president Javier Zanetti.

The Argentine forward has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona this summer and that has only intensified amid the expected departure of Luis Suarez to Juventus.

But club legend Zanetti has moved to quash any fears that Inter will lose the hotshot striker who formed such an effective partnership with Romelu Lukaku last season.

He insists the 23-year-old is happy in Italy, despite the links of a move to Barca, two years after he joined Inter from Racing Club. 

'Lautaro isn't leaving Inter,' Zanetti told Fox Sports, via Marca.

'It's not just Barcelona who are interested in him, but Lautaro knows that he's at a great club already.

'He looks happy with life in Italy, which isn't easy. I think he's going down the right path. For now, he's not leaving. He's our present and future. There's respect on the clubs' part.

Martinez ended a successful season with the disappointment of Europa League final defeat

'There are players that have release clauses and there's little you can do when a club comes in and pays it. But in Lautaro's case, he's just fine at Inter and I can tell when he's happy.'

Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo reported earlier this week that Barcelona are weighing up a move for Lyon star Memphis Depay as a cheaper alternative to Martinez.

They claimed that Barcelona had agreed a deal in principle with the Inter Milan striker.

However due to the economic context of the coronavirus crisis and the Serie A club's 'unwillingness' to sell him for less than £98.9m, this has meant that talks have stopped between the two sides.

Martinez scored 21 times in 49 appearances last season and helped Antonio Conte's side reach the Europa League final, where they were beaten in a thriller by Sevilla.
