Jessie J will reportedly sing about her relationship with Channing Tatum on her upcoming sixth studio album. 

The pair have been in an on-again, off-again romance since 2018 and the actor, 40, is said to have inspired a song on Jessie's new record called Simply Be In Love.

The lyrics of the track, obtained by The Sun, appear to suggest the reason for their many breakups was because they rushed into the relationship too quickly.  

Inspiration: Jessie J will reportedly sing about her relationship with Channing Tatum on her upcoming sixth studio album (pictured in January 2020) 

She sings: 'You're always dreaming about tomorrow, and I'm still overthinking yesterday.

'Where you go I know I want to follow, let's make a promise on today. Take it slow, baby steps, so we don't ruin what comes next. 

'Just be still, just stay calm, so we're not rushing what we are. Pressure off, just have fun, it's not a race, no need to run. If it's for ever, let's just simply be in love.'

Jessie, 32, elaborated on the track during an Instagram Live where she said: 'I wrote this song about when you first meet someone and you want to steam ahead.

'Sometimes running can ruin a foundation that a relationship needs, which is to just be chill, stay still and enjoy the moment.'

Jessie and Channing appeared to be back on during lockdown as he was seen taking the trash out from her house in LA in May. 

Before that the singer sparked reconciliation rumors when she uploaded a sweet message in celebration of his birthday.

Alongside a snap of the Step Up actor relaxing in the sea during a getaway, the songstress penned: 'Happy 40th Birthday to this special man right here.

'You are truly one of a kind. I am so grateful you were born, and even more grateful we met', she added. 'Keep living your BEST life!' [sic]

Romance: The lyrics of the track, obtained by The Sun, appear to suggest the reason for their many breakups was because they rushed into the relationship too quickly

Jessie's social media activity came just weeks after she was reported to have called it quits from the thespian once again, following on from their rekindled romance earlier this year.

Channing reportedly made an account on the celebrity dating app Raya following their break-up, quipping in his bio: 'And yes, I used to be a stripper. Sorry.'

The movie star and the songstress had an 'amicable' breakup and 'are still in contact,' a source told The Sun.

In wake of their most recent break-up, an insider added: 'Jessie and Channing really care for each other. You only need to look at the gushing posts they made about each other during their relationship to see that.

'That’s why they wanted to give their romance another shot, but sadly it hasn’t worked out.

'They’re spending time apart and are open to meeting new people. But you shouldn’t bet against another reunion in the future.'

The pair reunited in January following a nearly two-month long break, with a source telling E! at the time: 'They are fully back together'. 

The insider said the couple realised how much they care about each other during their time apart, and have been inseparable since deciding to rekindle their romance.

'They took a few weeks apart but ultimately decided they really care about each other,' the source added.

Jessie and Channing 'seem very happy to be spending time together again,' they added, as 'Jessie has been staying at Channing's house this past week' and they have been 'super-giddy around each other.'

The pair confirmed they were stronger than ever as they made their red carpet debut at MusiCares Person Of The Year bash just days later.

Channing shares six-year-old daughter Everly with ex-wife Jenna Dewan, who welcomed her son, Callum Michael Rebel, with fiancé Steve Kazee in March.
