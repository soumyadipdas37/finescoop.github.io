Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham all booked their place in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night while there was heartache for Crystal Palace.

Villa came from behind to beat Burton Albion 3-1, Newcastle overcame Blackburn 1-0 while West Ham easily saw off Charlton 3-0. 

However, Roy Hodgson's Palace side were defeated during a dramatic penalty shootout, which Bournemouth won 11-10 at the Vitality Stadium.    

Host commentator

It's up to Brooks again, the first penalty taker for Bournemouth. Second time round, he fires into the top left corner. Wonderful finish.

And Milivojevic misses, what a save from Begovic!

Bournemouth beat Crystal Palace on penalties are are finally through to face Manchester City in the third round!

Hennessey saves from Begovic! 

Now it's Hennessey's time to be the hero for Crystal Palace. And the goalkeeper blazes it over the crossbar. Unbelievable stuff

Brooks steps up for Bournemouth and puts them 1-0 up in the penalty shootout. Milivojevic levels with a composed finish into the bottom corner. 1-1.

Surridge then puts Bournemouth ahead again with a finish high into the left-hand side. Batshuayi, fresh from signing on loan from Chelsea again, drills Palace level at 2-2.

Billing then slots home into the corner for the Cherries. Townsend emulates Billing by sliding it just inside the post. 3-3.

Defenders step up now but it's great from Kelly as he sends Hennessey the wrong way. Eze with a ridiculously calm penalty levels it up again. Way to keep your cool! 4-4.

Solanke opens his right foot up to slot it past Hennessey to his left. It's Ayew to step up and keep Palace in this... and he does just that, sending Begovic the wrong way. 5-5.

Simpson then finds the bottom corner for Bournemouth. Meyer levels things up again, firing high. These are very good penalties. 6-6.

Gosling just about gets it past Hennessey, who gets his hand to it but can't quite keep it out. That's weak from the Palace keeper. Sakho then fires his penalty into the top left corner. What a finish from the Palace defender. 7-7.

Lerma coolly sends Hennessey the wrong way. And what a penalty from Kelly, who fires it high into the net past Begovic. 8-8.

Ofoborh then puts Bournemouth ahead again. Hard to keep up with this! Palace level again. 9-9.

Bournemouth get lucky as Zemura scuffs it. But Palace level it again. 10-10.

The referee has blown his whistle and Aston Villa are through to the third round.

Goals from Watkins, Grealish and Davis ensure Villa turned around an early 1-0 deficit to win 3-1.

Leyton Orient have done it, completing a remarkable turnaround.

Danny Johnson scores in the third minute of injury-time to make it 3-2 against Plymouth.

They were 2-0 behind and Leyton Orient look to have set up a third round tie against Tottenham!

And that's game over for Burton as Aston Villa go 3-1 ahead in injury-time.

Keinan Davis slots home in the second minute of injury-time with a composed finish. 

Sheffield Wednesday go 2-0 ahead at Rochdale thanks to an 88th minute goal from Josh Windass.

Aston Villa have the late breakthrough with two minutes to go.

Lansbury floats a corner out to the edge of the penalty area, which Grealish is ready to meet!

And the England midfielder drills a volley into the ground which finds the bottom right corner. After going behind in the second minute of the match, Grealish looks to have found the winner in the 88th minute for Villa.

Grealish continues to dictate the pace of the game against Burton. His mis-placed pass finds Jota on the edge of the penalty area but his left-footed effort sails just over the crossbar.

Close from the visitors. Just five minutes of normal time remaining.

There are five Carabao Cup second round ties yet to finish and three of those could be heading to penalties.

Stick with us for more drama...

It's all over at the London Stadium, and it's a much-needed victory for West Ham.

David Moyes made 10 changes and it paid off. Sebastien Haller scored a brace in the first half before Felipe Anderson put the icing on the cake late on.

And Newcastle can breathe easy now. Ryan Fraser proved the difference for the Magpies despite Blackburn exerting all the pressure in the second half.

Back-to-back wins to start the season for Steve Bruce's side.

Blackburn are really threatening, and Newcastle are going to be very relieved if they can get through this.

There is some last-ditch defending from Newcastle in injury-time!

Villa are starting to dominate against Burton now. Just 17 minutes of normal time remaining but the hosts are defending well.

Can Dean Smith's side find a winner?

West Ham are heading through to the third round, where they will play either Leeds or Hull.

After Sebastien Haller's double, Felipe Anderson gets on the scoresheet to make it 3-0 to the Hammers in the 80th minute.

The Brazilian rolls the ball into the bottom corner from 10 yards out.

It's not over just yet at St James' Park. Newcastle remain 1-0 up with 10 minutes of normal time remaining but it's Blackburn who are applying the pressure.

However, they can't find the breakthrough at the moment...

Watford seal their progression to the third round of the Carabao Cup after beating Oxford 3-0 on penalties.

They face Newport County in the next round.

Newcastle think they double their lead against Blackburn at St James' Park but the celebrations are short-lived.

Almiron feeds in Joelinton, who thinks he scores but the linesman raises his flag for offside!

Still 1-0 Newcastle with just over 15 minutes remaining...

It has been a very slow second half from West Ham despite being 2-0 up. Charlton have enjoyed the possession of the ball.

If the visitors can get a goal, it could lead to nervy times at the London Stadium...

Watford are right back in this, and it's a scrappy goal. Ken Sema slots home in the 89th minute. Can they now find a dramatic late winner against Oxford? Or are we going to penalties?

Watford are still trailing Oxford after the home side's early goal tonight. 

They have just five minutes of normal time remaining? Can the Championship side force a penalty shoot-out against the League One outfit?

Can Newcastle and West Ham stay firm and book their place in the third round?

Newcastle lead Blackburn 1-0 through Ryan Fraser while West Ham are 2-0 ahead thanks to a Sebastien Haller double.

Not much going on between Bournemouth and Crystal Palace at the Vitality Stadium.

It's been a scrappy affair and remains goalless heading into half-time. Hopefully it's a much better second half!

Preston have done it, they have sealed their third round spot thanks to a late turnaround against 10-man Derby.

39 minutes into his debut, Ollie Watkins has his first Aston Villa goal and it's laid on a plate for him!

Grealish produces a delightful through ball into the path of Taylor, who cuts it across the penalty area for Watkins to poke home from close range.

Burton's great start is cancelled out after fine play from the visitors.

What a turnaround at Pride Park from Preston.

After netting in the 79th minute to level things up, Preston look to have secured their spot in the third round through a Daniel Johnson penalty in injury-time.

They look like they will face Brighton/Portsmouth in the third round.

It's just what they needed after a horror opener in the Premier League.

Sebastien Haller's double has put West Ham in firm control at the London Stadium against Charlton.

ADAM SHERGOLD: Villa have controlled this game since falling behind in the second minute as you’d expect but much of their build-up has been ponderous and they’ve lacked a quality final ball.

There was one occasion when Jack Grealish covered 30 yards on a run through the middle but then ignored the easy through pass into Anwar El Ghazi to go himself and Burton’s Kieran Wallace blocked.

When he drifts out onto the left, Grealish is in an interesting tussle with Ben Fox who absolutely clattered him early on to make absolutely clear there would be no trickery or nonsense!

Ryan Fraser's goal has proved the difference going into half-time.

It was a slow start from Steve Bruce's side but a very well-worked goal has given Newcastle the edge heading into the break.

Coventry have been stunned. After dominating throughout, they were pegged back in injury time and Gillingham go on to win 5-4 on penalties.

Big win for the League One side!

 

With just over 10 minutes of normal time remaining, Preston equalise to make it 1-1 against Derby.

And it's an absolute rocket finish from Tom Barkhuizen. Can they find that winner in normal time?

It's a debut goal for Ryan Fraser after watching on from the bench as Newcastle beat West Ham 2-0 in the Premier League.

The former Bournemouth winger keeps his composure in a 1 v 1 situation after an exquisite through ball from Almiron. First goal in exactly a year for the winger.

35 minutes gone at St James' Park.

After the incredibly early setback, Aston Villa are getting back into this contest and Jack Grealish is starting to dictate the tempo.

Can Grealish, who just signed a new five-year contract today, be the main man once again for Villa?

Still 1-0 Burton after 18 minutes...

In the fourth minute of stoppage time at the Priestfield Stadium, Gillingham have pegged Coventry back at 1-1.

Jordan Graham keeps his cool from the penalty spot to level the scoring. Penalties are looming...

After making 10 changes, it could have been risky business for Moyes but it is certainly paying off.

And Haller has his second of the game in the 26th minute thanks to a brilliant header from a Snodgrass cross on the left. That will do the striker the world of confidence after a tough time of late.

The full-time whistle has blown across some of the grounds in the 6pm kick-offs.

Middlesbrough 0-2 Barnsley

Reading 0-1 Luton

Millwall 3-1 Cheltenham 

West Ham lift their spirits in the 22nd minute as Sebastien Haller pokes home from close range. 

Just the start David Moyes needed and it's fully deserved.

Fleetwood 1-0 Port Vale

Oxford United 1-0 Watford

Bradford 0-4 Lincoln

Burton Albion have gone ahead inside two minutes through Colin Daniel against Dean Smith's Premier League side.

Daniel smashes home high into the net first time. What a finish!

ADAM SHERGOLD: Wow, what a start for the League One side, who are clearly unwilling to give this strong Villa side an inch this evening.

That was the first goal left-back Colin Daniel has scored for the Brewers in 52 appearances. Not that you’d know it by that accomplished finish into the roof of the net.

Yarmolenko slots home from a Snodgrass corner at the second time of asking but the referee blows for a free-kick in favour for Charlton goalkeeper Amos.

It's Blackburn who nearly take the lead at St James' Park.

Holtby receives the ball after a cut back from Brereton, but his low effort drifts just wide of the post.

Derby have the breakthrough against Preston after a tight first half at Pride Park.

Just six minutes after the restart, Jason Knight gets on the scoresheet.

Meanwhile, Lincoln go 4-0 up against Bradford in just the 41st minute through James Jones. Yes, you heard that right!

West Ham have made a positive start at the London Stadium with the likes of Anderson and Snodgrass getting the ball early on.

They need an instant reply tonight after their 2-0 defeat in their season-opener in the Premier League against Newcastle.

We are underway at Newcastle vs Blackburn and West Ham vs Charlton!

Will the Premier League sides secure their place in the third round or will there be a surprise tonight? 

Lincoln go 3-0 up at Bradford in the 29th minute through Lewis Montsma from a set-piece. They are rampant and it looks like they will play Liverpool in the next round...

Oxford go 1-0 up at home against Watford through Rob Hall, and it's a great finish!

Meanwhile, they have one back but is it too little too late? Finn Azaz nets in the 69th minute for Cheltenham. 3-1 Millwall still...

No goals at Pride Park so far. Hoping for a better second half... 

Meanwhile, Millwall are on the brink of sealing their third round spot after going 3-0 up against Cheltenham. Matt Smith with the goal with just under 30 minutes of normal time remaining.

Fleetwood have started strongly and they have been rewarded after Paddy Madden puts the hosts ahead through Port Vale in the 14th minute.

What a start for Lincoln City as they go 2-0 up in the 6th minute. They break quickly and Anthony Scully is at the back post to poke home.

Meanwhile, Millwall go 2-0 ahead against Cheltenham, through Connor Mahoney!

It is a great start for Lincoln City, who take the lead in the fourth minute after Tyler French puts into his own net...

We are underway in the 7pm action. Here is who is in action right now:

Bradford vs Lincoln City

Fleetwood vs Port Vale

Newport County vs Cambridge

Oxford vs Watford

The second half is nearly underway in the 6pm kick-offs. Below are the current scorelines from those matches:

Gillingham 0-0 Coventry

Middlesbrough 0-2 Barnsley

Millwall 1-0 Cheltenham

Reading 0-1 Luton

It has been a very exciting day for Aston Villa fans after Jack Grealish signed a new five-year contract.

The England midfielder starts in midfield tonight for Dean Smith's side, while £33m signing Ollie Watkins makes his debut! 

It will be interesting to see how the former Brentford striker gets on tonight...
