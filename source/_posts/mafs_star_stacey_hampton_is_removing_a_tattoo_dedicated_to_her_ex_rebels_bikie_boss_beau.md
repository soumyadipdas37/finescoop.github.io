Married At First Sight's Stacey Hampton is in the process of removing a tattoo dedicated to her ex-fiance, Rebels Adelaide president Shane Michael Smith.

The 26-year-old reality TV star is covered in many inkings from her time with the bikie boss, including a large stomach tattoo dedicated to her late brother, which she often keeps well-hidden.

But on Tuesday, Stacey revealed on Instagram that she was getting a tattoo of Shane's name gradually lasered off her hand.

During an Instagram Q&A, Stacey showed off Shane's name in cursive on her hand. The tattoo appears to be slowly fading due to her regular laser appointments.

The blonde bombshell dated Shane, 37, for several years until their split in July 2017, a month before he was convicted of bashing two nightclub bouncers. 

The former couple share custody of two sons, Kruz, two, and Kosta, four.

Stacey, who is 11 years younger than Shane, has said they met when she in her early twenties.

'We met when I was very young, fell in love quickly and then tried to make it work for the kids,' she previously told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was a civil break-up. He's an amazing dad and I have no regrets.'  

Shane also has Stacey's name tattooed on his hand along with Kosta's name and birth date - January 25, 2016.
