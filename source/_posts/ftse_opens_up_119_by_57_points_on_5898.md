The FTSE 100 opened 1.19% higher this morning to reach nearly 5900 as it staged a marked recovery from Monday's dramatic falls. 

Britain's blue-chip index stood at 5898.98 at the start of today's session following a strong overnight performance on Wall Street.

Boris Johnson's new coronavirus restrictions proved as expected when they were announced yesterday, lessening their impact for worried traders.

It came as business leaders criticised the PM for imposing new restrictions on the economy as it begins to recover from the depths of the Covid crisis. 

Mr Johnson said it was necessary to reintroduce working from home rules and a swathe of social measures in order to avoid a dramatic surge in deaths. 

But the beleaguered premier faced fire from all sides as he U-turned on his push to reopen workplaces. 

He also faced barbs for introducing other swingeing new measures including a 10pm pub curfew and £200 fines for mask rule-breakers in England. 

The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 was also up this morning, climbing 0.86%. 

Traders will be keenly analysing the effects of the new restrictions on economic activity, as well as data on new infections. 

The FTSE 100 closed 25 points (0.43%) at 5,829 yesterday - a marked recovery from Monday's plunge which saw £51bn wiped off its value.
