She's one of Bravo's Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.

But on Sunday, Garcelle Beauvais headed to the neighboring community of Sherman Oaks to get a little salon pampering.

The 57-year-old got her nails done, making sure to wear a face mask to abide my COVID-19 rules in Los Angeles.

The actress and reality star showed off her legs in a pair of distressed Daisy Dukes.

She tucked a lemon yellow blouse into the denim cutoffs and added a leopard-print belt.

She paired her outfit with yellow flip-flops and yellow-tinted glasses and carried a large leather designer tote over one shoulder as she walked.

Beauvais completed her look with a gold nameplate necklace and a luxury watch.

In early July, Beauvais had revealed her reservations about becoming the first black castmember on RHOBH.

'I definitely felt pressure that people wanted me to come in and do a certain thing or have a chip on my shoulder,' she explained in an episode of podcast Reality Life with Kate Casey.  

'I really didn't want to be labeled an angry black woman. That's not who I am,' she said.

'I just wanted to stay true to who I am, and I think that's what people have been able to see so far,' she added.

Beauvais has enjoyed a successful Hollywood career with roles on TV's The Jamie Foxx Show, NYPD Blue and Grimm.

On the big screen she's been seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming, White House Down, Flight and Barbershop 2: Back In Business.

She's also reprised her original Coming To America role opposite Eddie Murphy in a sequel scheduled to be released in December.
