Sergie Aurier is keen on a move to AC Milan after Tottenham confirmed the signing of Matt Doherty, according to reports.

The Serie A side have long been linked with a move for the right back and reportedly had an opening bid of just under £13million rejected with Spurs holding out for a fee of £18m. 

The north London club completed the £15m signing of Doherty on Sunday meaning Aurier will be further down the pecking order. The Daily Star claim the defender rejected the chance to move to Wolves as part of the deal.

According to Football Italia, Aurier is focused on securing a switch to the San Siro. Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen have also been linked with a move for the full-back.

Spurs paid £23m to sign the Ivory Coast international from Paris Saint-Germain in 2017.

But the 27-year-old had a frustrating first season in the Premier League with just eight appearances.

The defender failed to force a move last summer but went on to become a regular starter under Jose Mourinho following Mauricio Pochettino's departure.

Aurier managed eight assists and two goals across all competitions in the 2019-20 season.

In comparison, new boy Doherty made seven assists and scored five goals. 

Milan are on the lookout for a new right back but are said to have other transfer targets including Brescia's Sandro Tonali, Chelsea's Tiemoue Bakayoko and Real Madrid's Brahim Diaz.
