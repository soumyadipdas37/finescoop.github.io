Earlier this month, she celebrated her 25th birthday in style, by treating herself to a luxury spa break in the Scottish Highlands.

And Kady McDermott kept the pampering going over the weekend, when she  shared snaps of herself enjoying a similar break at London's Glass House Retreat.

The former Love Island star set pulses racing as she uploaded an image of herself posing in a skimpy thong bikini – showing off her pert posterior as she posed with her back to the camera.

Standing before a welcoming indoor pool, the reality star opted to go makeup-free for her relaxing day, while her raven locks fell beyond her shoulders.

Captioning the scintillating snap, TV personality Kady simply wrote: 'Chilled weekend at the @glasshouseretreat.'

She also shared shots of her time at the spa, showing workout sessions, healthy vegan meals, as well as wrapping up in the comfort of a fluffy bathrobe.

Kady recently left fans confused after she announced she is still with boyfriend Myles Barnett and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.

The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.

The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house.

She blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby.  

Amazing: She also revealed that she had indulged in 'the most amazing' deep tissue massage

Healthy delights: Among the other delights she was seen enjoying were healthy vegan meals

She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable.

'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.

'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'

'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)
