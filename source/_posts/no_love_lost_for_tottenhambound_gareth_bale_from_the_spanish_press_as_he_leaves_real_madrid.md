Gareth Bale's impending return to Tottenham dominates the front pages in Spain with the theme being that Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has got his way in securing his exit.

The relationship between Bale and Zidane had broken down last season which led to the Bernabeu club urgently wanting the Wales star off their books.

And they have accomplished that with his season-long loan worth more than £13million representing an emotional return to his former club.

'Zidane: He gets his way' was the headline on Marca as his £13m loan to Tottenham was agreed

'Zidane: He has his way' reads the front page headline in Marca which features a photograph of Zidane keeping a beady eye on Bale during a training session.

They add that the deal is close to completion with Real paying almost half of Bale's £500,000-a-week wages during the course of the loan.

Marca also report that Bale's Real team-mate, the left-back Sergio Reguilon, is also poised to sign for Spurs for £27m. Reguilon, who has also been linked with Manchester United, will sign a five-year deal.

AS also lead on the story with the simple headline 'Bye Bale' with a picture of the smiling player heading the ball in training.

They focus on comments by the former Real manager Jose Mourinho, now in charge at Tottenham, that this is the third time he has tried to sign Bale.

'I tried to sign him for Real Madrid which was not possible to do during my time there,' Mourinho said on Wednesday.

'But the president followed my instinct and my knowledge and the season I left he brought Gareth to the club.

'There is no secret on that. Even Gareth knows that. But I'm not going to speak about him anymore because he is a Real Madrid player.'

Mourinho also tried to sign Bale when he was Manchester United manager but couldn't prise him away from Real.

Meanwhile, AS calculate that Bale has cost Madrid 23,800 euros (£21,638) for every minute he was on the field last season.

Bale played 1,260 minutes across 20 Real matches in all competitions - 27.5 per cent of the total the team played - scoring three goals and contributing two assists in another campaign plagued by injury.

He featured in just two matches following the post-lockdown restart as his relationship with Zidane deteriorated.
