Britney Spears' live-in boyfriend Sam Asghari leaped to her defense this week after an Instagram commenter criticized her account.

Writer Kelly Oxford commented on Britney's page: 'This account finally got too scary for me,' prompting a reply from Sam, who is in his 20s.

The dreamboat wrote: 'what’s so scary about being the biggest superstar in the world being herself (authentic, funny, humble) without caring what others think....'

He added: 'we need more people like her and less Karen’s. also Instagram installed this button that you can hit to unfollow about 10 years ago…'

Britney's fans screen-grabbed the exchange and posted it to social media where it did the rounds this Friday.

Sam's Instagram defense went viral a day after Britney doubled down on her fight for more control of her conservatorship and has seemingly thrown her support behind the Free Britney movement.

The 38-year-old's attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported on Thursday.

The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers.

Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, according to TMZ. 

'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote.

The outlet added that the Toxic singer said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye. 

Britney shares sons Sean Preston, 14 and Jayden James, 13 with ex Kevin Federline.

The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans. 

'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote (Jamie pictured in 2008 when the conservatorship was put in place)

Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Womanizer crooner to be released from her conservatorship.

'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf. 

Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception,has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate. 

'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public,' the court document stated of the Free Britney movement

The court document stated of Free Britney: 'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.' 

That line seemed to be in direct response to an interview that Britney's dad gave last month in an effort to curtail the movement.

'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told PageSix.

Adding: 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'  

'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told Page Six in August. 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'

Earlier this summer the Free Britney frenzy reached a fever pitch when a legion of her fans became convinced that her social media videos were old and being shared by her team to try to 'fake' that she is okay.

That prompted Spears to share a sort of proof-of-life post - a date stamped photo  - to assuage the concerned fans and show she isn't locked up and still has access to her phone. 

'Just so you guys know these aren't old ... check the date at the top of the 2nd pic!!!!' she wrote in the caption at the time.  

'The fact you need to post the date to prove she's real looks really suspicious...we all know someone's running the account,' wrote one person who wasn't placated by the attempt.

This latest court filing is part of Britney's ongoing effort to have her father's legal control over career, finances and estate lifted or loosened.

Last month, her lawyers submitted paper work stating she was 'strongly opposed' to her father having control of her estate and finances, according to TMZ.

Instead the singer wishes for her temporary conservator Jodi Montgomery to take on the role permanently. 

Jamie was appointed as his daughter's conservator in 2008 following her very public breakdown. However, last year, he stepped aside from the role due to ongoing health issues.

The why: A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing; she has not performed live since October 2018 (Pictured on tour in August 2018)

A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing.

She has not performed live since October 2018 when she wrapped up the final legs of her Piece of Me Tour after concluding her Las Vegas residency on December 31, 2017.

Since then, she has been living mainly at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles, with her boyfriend Sam Asghari.

Spears' conservatorship is currently under review by a judge in Los Angeles.

On Thursday afternoon, Britney shared a a short clip to her Instagram while posing up a storm to show off her makeup look.

She was standing outside in her off-the-shoulder floral top while sporting a choker; her hair was half-up, half down and she wore just a touch of makeup.

Britney captioned the video: 'For the first time in my life I'm going without lots and lots of makeup!!!! These clips show a closer look at my face... which is very scary for me.'

She continued:  'You can actually see my freckles!!!! Growing up in Hollywood can be hard!!!! It's about looks... and the press can be pretty mean... "why does she look so old" ... "why does she look so young" ... "why is she too big"... "why is she too skinny" ?!?!?!?!?!

Adding: 'As Selena Gomez says... the world can be a nasty place... kill them with kindness... GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!!! And with all that love right back to ya!!! Ps... just another touch of ROSE !!!'

The Selena song she is referring to is called Kill Em With Kindness from her 2015 album Revival.
