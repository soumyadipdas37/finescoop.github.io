If you're already planning for next year's holiday, here's a simple hack that will get you 48 days off using only 18 days of annual leave.  

For many of us, this year's holidays have been anti-climatic due to the 160 plus days the UK has spent in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, but for those already looking ahead, next year could be more promising.

Instant Office has revealed how you can cleverly book around the remaining bank holidays and weekends this year and next year.

So while you won't actually get any more time off work, it will feel like you are as you'll be getting longer holiday breaks with minimal days off used.

Cash in on Christmas...

With both Christmas Day (2020) and New Year's Day (2021) falling on a Friday, this is your chance to bridge the gap to create a solid break of 10 days by booking the days between them off. 

Those who work Monday to Friday can use just three days of annual leave to book the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between the bank holidays - giving the total of ten consecutive days off in a row - including weekends.   

Book: December 29, 30, 31 - for a ten day break.

Have an easy-going Easter...

For another ten day break, book off the days between Good Friday and Easter Monday.

Good Friday will fall on April 2 with Easter Monday on April 5, so combined with weekends, you can enjoy another long stretch by booking the four days off from Tuesday April 6 to Friday April 9. 

Book: April 6, 7, 8, 9 - for a ten day stretch. 

Christmas and New Year's Day can be enjoyed in one long stretch if you follow the tips. Pictured, stock image

May Day your holiday away...  

Enjoy nine days off by booking another four days of holiday after this year's May Day, Monday May 3.

Book: May 4, 5, 6, 7 - for a nine day break.    

Summer holiday with the kids? 

Here you can enjoy nine days off by using just four days of your holiday allowance following the August bank holiday on August 30. A perfect opportunity to get away during the school summer holidays.

Book: August 31, September 1, 2, 3 - a nine day break.

Now that's the festive spirit! Christmas 2021...

Again, workers can bag a ten day break by only booking three days of annual leave. With Christmas falling on a Saturday and Boxing Day on a Sunday, the substitute bank holidays will be December 27 and 29.

The same is true for New Years Day (2022), which will fall on a Saturday, meaning January 3 is the substitute bank holiday.

Book: December 29, 30, 31 to enjoy a ten day break.
