Edin Dzeko is set to join Juventus from Roma in a €16million (£15m) deal, dashing Luis Suarez's hopes of a move to the Serie A champions.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina striker, 34, will bring the curtain down on a five-year spell in the Italian capital with a switch to Turin, according to goal.com

Dzeko is expected to sign a two-year deal in Piedmont worth €7.5m (£7m) per year.

The move could could dash Luis Suarez's proposed move from Barcelona despite passing Italian exam in bid to secure dual nationality  

Suarez has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Nou Camp by new boss Ronald Koeman and that has accelerated interest in him from Italian champions Juventus. 

But with Andrea Pirlo limited as to the number of non-EU (European Union) players he can acquire in one window, the club needed Suarez to pass his exam in Perugia and acquire dual nationality to make a transfer possible this month.

Gazzetta dello Sport reported that the player achieved the B1 certification diploma after a one-hour exam. 

He was reportedly tested in four key areas: listening and comprehension of oral texts, reading and writing in Italian, how to use Italian on a daily basis and a face to face dialogue to test his speaking skills.
