A policeman was left with blood gushing from his head and shoulder after a man allegedly slashed him with a knife during a midnight arrest.

A Lakemba man, 32, allegedly attacked two police officers with a knife and bit another on York Street in the Sydney CBD at 12:20 am on Wednesday. 

Police were called after the man allegedly harassed a food delivery rider on George Street, which is one of the busiest streets in the city centre. 

Officers then approached the man as he was walking along the nearby York Street, which is when he allegedly pulled out a knife and started attacking them.
