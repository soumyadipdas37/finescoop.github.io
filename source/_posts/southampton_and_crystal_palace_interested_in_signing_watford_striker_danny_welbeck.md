Watford striker Danny Welbeck is attracting interest from Southampton and Crystal Palace. 

The Selhurst Park club are also considering a move for QPR winger Bright Samuel after signing his teammate Ebere Eze for £19.5m last week.

Watford are discussing a possible deal to re-sign Fernando Forestieri.

Meanwhile, Liverpool are prepared to match Watford’s £40million asking price for striker Ismaila Sarr.

The 22-year-old is said to be Jurgen Klopp’s top transfer target this summer as he looks to reinforce his bench with Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah nailed-on starters.

Sarr has risen to the top of Liverpool's wishlist because of his ability to play on either the wing or through the middle - making him a more attractive proposition to Wolves star Adam Traore, according to the Sun.
