These are the photos that prove beyond doubt that rumoured Bachelor finalist Bella Varelis doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart on the show.

The marketing consultant, 25, was pictured getting very flirty with ex-Bachelorette contestant Nathan Favro at the beach in Point Piper, Sydney, on Monday.

She seemed to be enjoying the single life as she swooned over the 25-year-old artist, before they headed into the ocean for a swim together.

Spoiler alert: The photos prove beyond doubt that Bella, 25, doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart

While splashing around in the shallow water, at one stage Bella playfully pushed Nathan away with a cheeky smile on her face.

She then pointed out something in the distance, and later appeared to invite her male companion to check out the tan lines on her backside.

The pair were joined by fellow Bachelor contestant Bec Cvilikas, who is rumoured to place third in Locky's season after arriving late as an intruder.

Bella and Bec are now renting an apartment together in Bondi - a living arrangement that all but confirms neither of them wins the show.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 and Nathan Favro for comment.

Fans of The Bachelor franchise will remember party boy Nathan from Ali Oetjen's season of The Bachelorette in 2018.

He was infamously kicked off the show after Ali, 34, accused him of spreading rumours in the mansion about her sexual history.

He later denied starting gossip, telling Now To Love: 'We were all sitting around the pool and the topic of the rumours was brought up.

'A few of the boys had said what they had heard and I basically just said what I had heard.'

Bella is one of the front-runners on The Bachelor this year, with online betting agency Sportsbet tipping her for second place, behind Irena Srbinovska.

She had been an early favourite to win the season, according to bookies, but quickly fell behind nurse Irena, 31, as the season progressed.

In recent episodes, the former friends have clashed in the mansion as the competition for Locky's heart heats up.

Bella has accused Irena of being 'manipulative', but she has risked alienating Locky by sharing her concerns about her rival with him.

Irena is widely rumoured to win the show, and a Channel 10 spokesperson said this week that Locky is still dating his winning contestant.
