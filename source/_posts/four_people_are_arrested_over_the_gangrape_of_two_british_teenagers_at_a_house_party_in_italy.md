Four people have been arrested over the alleged gang-rape of two British teenage girls at a house party in Italy.

The assault is said to have taken place at a villa in the small seaside town of Marconia di Pisticci in southern Italy, in a region that is one of Italy's most popular tourist destinations.

Authorities are investigating reports that a group of uninvited boys forced their way into the party and attacked the girls.  

'On the night between 7-8 September, in Marconia di Pisticci, sexual violence was committed against two foreign minors who were at a party in a villa,' Local police said in a statement on Thursday.

'The investigative unit of Matera police headquarters has begun investigations in coordination with the public prosecutor's office.' 

According to local media reports, the two girls - who are said to be teenagers - were punched and kicked before being raped by more than one person.

News website Sassilive said the attack took place in the early hours of Monday, when ‘the girls were attacked by a herd of eight boys behind a bush near the place where the party took place’.

The girls were able to make it back to their accommodation where police were alerted and they were then rushed to a hospital in Matera, around 40 miles away. 

There, they were treated for shock and were found to have marks on their bodies. They have since been discharged from hospital, according to local reports.

One of the girls is said to have relatives from England living in the area after they moved to Italy several years ago. 

The 12,000 residents of Marconia are in deep state of shock, according to local paper La Gazetta Del Mezzogiorno which called it an 'extremely shameful' case.

Viviana Verri, the mayor of the town, said in a statement: 'This is the moment in which the spirit of our community must emerge strongly, a healthy community that cannot and must never get used to such episodes.

'For this reason [witnesses] cannot afford to keep silent [and must] help investigators to put an end to this affair.'

The Pisticci State Police Commissioner is leading the investigation and few details have been released due to young ages of the alleged victims.
