He made his new relationship Instagram official on Sunday, by sharing loved-up pictures with stunning brunette beauty Lili Newman.

And on Tuesday, Jonethen Musulin shared another adorable image of the couple to Instagram.

'Negative for Covid. Positive for Cooties,' the 28-year-old captioned the photo. 

Urban Dictionary defines cooties as a 'diseases that the opposite sex has that gives you a reason to not be around them'.  

In the image, Jonethen is sporting a grey T-shirt emblazoned with an american flag design, a gold necklace and sunglasses. 

Lilli wore a pair of tortoiseshell sunglasses and had her brunette locks pulled up into a bun.

Last week, Jonethen revealed he was grateful to have found his 'perfect match' - this time without the help of MAFS' resident relationship 'experts'.   

'She's beautiful, funny, what more could I want? She's the perfect match for me,' he told Daily Mail Australia.     

The Queensland-based FIFO worker explained that his romance with Lilli had been almost a decade in the making.

'We’ve known each other for about eight years, but Lilli has always worked away,' he said of his professional dancer girlfriend.

However, Jonethen said she returned home amid the coronavirus pandemic, which gave him the opportunity to court her.  

'It gave me the chance to finally take her on a date, eight years in the making. The date went amazing, and since then we’ve been basically inseparable,' he said.

Jonethen was 'married' to Connie Crayden on MAFS, but the couple chose to leave the social experiment single when they filmed their final vows last December.
