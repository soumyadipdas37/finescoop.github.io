Montana also revealed she is single but has been dating many suitors since their break-up, after she was linked to Waltham Abbey FC footballer Charlie Edwards in June.

Montana said: 'I am officially single, but actually loving it.

'Also the show must go on, I'm feeling pretty fresh, I mean I wasn't feeling fresh when it first happened, don't get me wrong, I was pretty down in the dumps.

'But I feel like everything happens for a reason, I've been really able to focus on myself and my personal growth, personal goals.

'I've met some amazing people along the way, I think everything happens for a reason.'
