She has remained single since splitting from her ex-husband Lee Henderson two years ago.

And romance is evidently not on the cards anytime soon for Jackie 'O' Henderson, who was left mortified after being rejected by a virgin named George on Monday's episode of The Kyle and Jackie O Show.

The 45-year-old's horror escalated when the show's guest - who has also never had a girlfriend or kissed a woman - savagely implied that he didn't want to date her because she was 'sleeping around'. 

Turned down: Jackie 'O' Henderson was left mortified after facing rejection by a virgin named George on Monday's episode of The Kyle and Jackie O Show

Jackie and her co-host Kyle Sandilands appeared in great spirits as they welcomed George on their show to talk about his virginity and inability to find love.

Taking pity on George's life-long single status, Kyle informed him that Jackie was available and cheekily asked if he 'wanted to give her a run'.

Inexperienced George immediately hesitated, before responding: 'Well, I don't want to say it... but I know where she's been.'

A shocked Jackie asked: 'What do you mean?'

Hilarious: The awkward exchange occurred when Kyle Sandilands [pictured] took pity at George's life-long single status and informed him that Jackie was available and cheekily asked if he 'wanted to give her a run'

George immediately hesitated before responding: 'Well, I don't want to say it... but I know where she's been. Didn't you work on the Gold Coast before?'

Amused at the turn of events, Kyle hilariously chimed in: 'You won't be with a w**** - is that what you're saying?'

Aghast at the accusations, Jackie replied: 'I haven't had many partners, George!'

George became increasingly flustered, as he confessed: 'I probably shouldn't have said anything.'

Jackie was unable to shake off her shock, adding: 'I've never been told that before! "I know where you've been". Oh my god!'

Aghast at the accusations, Jackie replied: 'I haven't had many partners, George!'

Inexperienced: Virgin George has also never had a girlfriend or kissed a woman in his life 

'Not even a big, fat Greek virgin will even consider you!' Kyle couldn't resist getting in the last word, saying: 'Jackie, you're going to have to do some serious PR work if you think you're ever going to get another bloke'

Attempting to justify his offending statement, George said: 'Well, didn't you work on the Gold Coast before?'

Jackie replied: 'Yeah, but that didn't mean I slept around, George!'

Kyle couldn't resist getting in the last word, saying: 'Jackie, you're going to have to do some serious PR work if you think you're ever going to get another bloke.

'Not even a big, fat Greek virgin will even consider Jackie O!'

Ex: Jackie has remained single since splitting from her ex-husband Lee Henderson two years ago. They share custody of nine-year-old daughter Kitty. All three are pictured
