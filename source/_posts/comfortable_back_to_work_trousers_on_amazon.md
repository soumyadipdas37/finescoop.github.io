Thanks to the coronavirus lockdown, our daily dressing dilemmas only went as far as to what leggings or loungewear to slip on. But with many of us slowly heading back to the office it's time for a wardrobe update. 

If you're not ready to give up on comfortable dressing just yet then it might be worth following the hundreds of shoppers who have bought, and loved, the Roman Originals Women Stretch Pull On Trousers.

Amazon shoppers are raving about the pull-on style trousers, calling them a 'smart alternative to jeggings', 'perfect for the office' and 'comfy and flattering'. And, with prices starting from just £18.25, they're incredibly affordable too.

The Roman Originals Women Stretch Pull On Trousers are available in nine colours and in sizes 10 to 20 with prices from £18.25

A pair of tailored trousers is a wardrobe essential. They are perfect for date-nights, interviews or those days where jeans won't cut it. 

Fuss-free, elegant and surprisingly comfortable, the Roman Originals Women Stretch Pull On Trousers have been a big hit among Amazon shoppers, with one customer describing them as the 'perfect trousers for work'. 

They are as close to leggings as you can get away with in the office, and the distinction between casual and formal is all in the details. The elasticated, pull-on style with no zip or fastening makes for superior comfort, while the high-waited fit ensures they'll stay in place all day.  

Reviewers have reported that the Roman Originals Stretch Pull On Trousers are much more comfortable than traditional work trousers, giving you plenty of movement. The tapered leg is designed to remain straight and finish at a flattering ankle grazer length.

'These really surprised me,' one shopper wrote. 'Great fit. Very comfortable and breathable material. Look great on with either casual or smart blouse/top. The design of the ankle area gives it a smart appearance. The high waist is great doesn’t roll down'.

Another added: 'Finally, the perfect trousers for work! Really comfortable with great stretch but also look smart. I'm a teaching assistant so often am on the floor with little ones and these will be great. Off to buy more colours!'

The tapered pull-on work trouser has no fastening and instead features an elasticated contoured waistband for extra comfort

The pull-on trousers are available in nine shades, including classic black, dark grey and navy, as well as brighter options like rust and amber.  

Over 600 Amazon shoppers have rated the leggings, with many praising the affordable price point and comfortable fit. 

'Sleek, smart and flattering,' one wrote. 'I love these for work, I initially bought the black and loved them so much went back for navy and grey! They're very versatile depending on the type of top/shoes/boot you wear and I just adore them. My fave new work gear.'

Another raved about the fit, writing: 'I was pleasantly surprised by how comfy and well fitting these trousers are. I bought them for work and wasn't expecting much. 

'But they are so comfy and flattering ill probably order a couple more pairs. The only thing that could make them any better would be pockets.'
