Fulham players are backing manager Scott Parker over his annoyance at owner Tony Khan's post-match Twitter apology after Monday's defeat by Aston Villa.

Khan took to social media immediately after the 3-0 loss to say sorry for Fulham's display before promising to land reinforcements before the transfer deadline on Monday.

On Tuesday, Parker publicly voiced his displeasure at the owner's social media comments, branding them 'unhelpful'.

And Sportsmail understands that numerous Fulham players have also been angered by Khan's comments.

A source said: 'The players are not happy at all with the post. It undermines the squad and it looks like they don't have the club's backing.'

During his post-match press conference after the defeat by Villa, Parker played a straight bat towards questions regarding Khan's social media activity.

But having had time to digest the comments, the Cottagers boss said on Tuesday: 'People have the platform. You own a football club, you can decide how you want to communicate or send a message out.

'It's not something I agree with, it's not helpful from that sense but like I said that's down to the owner and how he sees it.

'There's one thing that I'm disappointed with and that's how he's actually apologising for the performance and that is something that I don't agree with and he shouldn't have.

'The performance last night was a good performance which was a group of players who have done everything they can, worked tirelessly from the first minute to the 95th.

'At 3-0 down they were still trying to work as much as they can to try and get us back in the game and for that I don't agree with him.

'I'll be the first to have an issue with my squad and my team and my players if I felt that that was something which needed to be criticised.

'So I have an issue with that and obviously that's something which I don't agree with.'

Fulham will make signing new defenders a priority ahead of the transfer deadline, with Wolves centre back Ryan Bennett understood to be on the club's radar.
