Australian discount chain The Reject Shop will start stocking grocery items this week after securing a deal with the UK's largest supermarket Tesco.

The three-year agreement will see top-selling Tesco-branded pantry items - including tea, biscuits, soups, rice, pasta and baby care - being sold at the Reject Shop's stores nationwide.

Andre Reich, The Reject Shop's CEO, told Daily Mail Australia customers are looking for cheaper alternatives now more than ever during the coronavirus crisis.

'We are very excited to utilise our 354 store buying power to bring quality and innovative Tesco products to Australia, the first of which will hit all stores in early September 2020,' he said in a statement.

'We absolutely connect with what Tesco stands for as 'a champion for customers – helping them to enjoy a better quality of life and an easier way of living,' a similar mission to ours in that we are helping Australians save more money every day.'

The groundbreaking supply deal was struck four months ago and comes as the variety store looks repositions itself as a bigger and more hip player on the Australian retail scene.

In August, financial services firm Morgan Stanley suggested the The Reject Shop could become a $3billion stock within the next 10 years as it moves towards a younger consumer-based feeling the economic pinch from COVID-19.

The discount chain, which first launched four decades ago, is eyeing off the likes of Aldi and Kmart and already employs over 5,300 workers across Australia, generating more than 800million dollars in sales each year.

As well as dry-store packaged food, Tesco will also supply The Reject Shop with a range of health and beauty products in coming months as well as other household items.

Although both parties admit the unusual deal may take some customers by surprise, Tesco Group Export Director Jack Brabin said it will be a major windfall for Australian consumers - along with the 1.2 million British expats living Down Under.

'We're delighted to be partnering with The Reject Shop to provide a range of fantastic Tesco products across grocery and baby care,' he said.

'As the UK's leading food retailer, we take enormous care to ensure our products are the best quality and offer great value. We look forward to sharing them with The Reject Shop's customers.

While Australia's retail sector continues to struggle during the COVID-19 pandemic, annual revenue for The Reject Shop was up 3.4 per cent to $820.6million in the 2019-20 financial year.

Gross profit increased 0.3 per cent to $335.8million.
