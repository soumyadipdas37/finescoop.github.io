Former Disney star Bella Thorne shared a post to Instagram on Wednesday that had her fans enthusiastic.

The Shake It Up actress was seen in three new images where she had on a white lace wedding veil as the beauty wrote in her caption, 'Such a happy girl.'

The star - who was born Annabella Avery Thorne - appeared to be suggesting she was either married to or was going to wed her boyfriend of one year, Benjamin Mascolo.

Not only did she have on a fancy white veil, but on her wedding finger looked to be a diamond engagement ring that was next to a large emerald ring.

There were many reactions to her new images. 

Her friend Paris Hilton shared a love-eyed emoji and clicked like but did not make a comment.

Novaampliacao asked, 'Want to marry me beautiful bride ???' while Bellaxoxodaya, demanded, 'Marry ME.'  

The link took her over 20M Instagram followers to her OnlyFans account, which fans need a subscription to see.

The former Disney Channel star seems to be serious with her beau Mascolo.

On Tuesday she was seen heading to dinner with the Italian artist in West Hollywood.

The 22-year-old paired the top with a matching black ruffled mini skirt, which showed off her toned legs in a pair of black leather platform combat boots.

She finished the ensemble with a black 'vote' face mask, a chunky pearl Chanel choker, a matching handbag, a white Clinch Belts belt with a gold buckle and diamond bling on her wrists and fingers.

Bella held hands with Benjamin, 27, who sported an equally pink look, as they arrived at the celeb favorite hotspot Craig's.

She previously took to her Instagram Story to show off a bouquet of roses he bought her, writing: 'My boyfriend is perfect perfect perfect.'

The actress gushed to her 23.8million followers: 'Come on. I mean... Come on, my boyfriend, number one stunner. Come on! I mean, just gorgeous. Gorgeous!'

She also took to her profile with a behind-the-scenes photo from her Stupid F***ing B**** music video, showing her in a white bikini and matching pearls, looking into a poolside monitor.

Bella teased the video for her new single the night before on Instagram, writing: 'STUPID F***ING B**** just about to drop this on my ONLY fans !!! Link in bio BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND SEE' 

She launched her OnlyFans last month, charging $20 a month, $51 for a three-month subscription or $102 for six months.  

The Assassination Nation actress was reportedly the first content creator on the platform to earn $1million in their first 24 hours, after briefly crashing the site.  

She told the Los Angeles Times that she made $2million in the first week, and she's 'putting the earnings into her production company and toward charity.'

Although the site is mostly for adult entertainers to monetize their work, Thorne tweeted: 'Also nooooo I’m not doing nudity!!!'

But she quickly stirred up controversy, when she charged $200 for nude photos, which weren't actually nude, prompting many users to complain and request refunds.

The site subsequently implemented some unwelcome changes, like capping payments at $50 for pay-per-view posts, as well as a hold that would require some international users to wait 30 days for their payout.

Many sex workers who rely on the platform for their livelihood blamed Bella for making their jobs more difficult.

She later apologized on Twitter, writing: 'I wanted to bring attention to the site, the more people on the site the more likely of a chance to normalize the stigmas, And in trying to do this I hurt you.
