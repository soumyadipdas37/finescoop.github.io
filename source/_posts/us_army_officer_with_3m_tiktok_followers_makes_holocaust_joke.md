DailyMail.com has reached out to Freihofer for comment.

Freihofer is considered a social media influencer. The videos he posts to TikTok which show him lifting weights, singing songs, making jokes, and going about his military service regularly attract millions of views.  

A TikTok spokesperson told DailyMail.com that the clip was removed by the company for violating its policies against hate speech.

A spokesperson for the US Army referred the matter to Freihofer’s unit - the 18th Airborne Corps.

Reaction on social media was swift as outraged Twitter users demanded that the Army take action against Freihofer.

‘Lt. Nathan Freihofer's “joke” is not only offensive, it dishonors the memory of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the fight against Nazi tyranny,’ the American Jewish Committee tweeted on Monday.

‘He should apologize now.’

Jake Tapper of CNN tweeted: ‘I admit I don’t understand how anyone, let alone a US military officer, would think it amusing that Jews were mass exterminated during the Holocaust.’

Fred Wellman tweeted: ‘Unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable.’

Wellman added: ‘I don’t want this POS leading my kids.

‘We ask America’s parents to trust us with their sons and daughters.

‘I don’t trust this “influencer”.

‘Maybe he should worry about serving the country and not his followers.’
