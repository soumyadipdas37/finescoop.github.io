Peter Crouch showed off his new moustache as he enjoyed a romantic date night with his wife Abbey Clancy on Wednesday.

The former footballer, 39, posed for a clip taken by Abbey, 34, as they went for a meal in a restaurant where he displayed his new look. 

Posting the snap to her Instagram Stories, the model captioned it: 'The tree #ifyouknowyouknow'.

In the clip, Abbey said she disliked the tree in the background while Peter joked he was 'into trees in restaurants first'. 

Abbey occasionally shares glimpses into the couple's married life on her social media and marked their ninth wedding anniversary in June with a loved-up post.

'9 years married and counting ❤️❤️❤️I adore you always and forever,' she wrote alongside an old photo of the couple sharing a passionate kiss.   

It comes after Abbey recently shared an Instagram Vs Reality post on her Stories, with the first snap featuring the beauty modelling a sizzling dress, before the shoot was crashed by her four children.

Abbey and Peter share four kids - Sophia, nine, Liberty, five, Johnny, two and Jack, 15 months, and the rowdy foursome couldn't resist interrupting their mum's glam moment. 

Abbey looked sensational as she posed in her plush home, wearing a tight black dress with a daring split in the first photo. 

Flashing her long legs, she paired the dress with thigh-high boots as she posed and pouted for the selfie.

But the reality of the glam session was revealed in the model's second shot as she struck another pose while her four children played around her.

Her toddler Johnny, was half dressed with Abbey covering his modesty with an emoji, while her eldest Sophia got to grips with homework on the floor and Liberty and Jack ran around their mum.

Peter opened up about his dad duties in a new interview this week with Rob Beckett and Josh Widdcombe's Parenting Lockdown Hell, admitting that his wife doesn't trust him alone with their brood.

'We've got some help, her mum is very good and we've got some family who can help us because I don't think Abs would trust me fully on my own with all four,' the ex footballer admitted.

Abbey could be heard speaking in the background, as he added: 'She's looking at me now, oh yea did you hear that? She's shouted over the top of me, "what about that time you lost him at the farm?"

He said of the incident with son Jack: 'We're all in the farm and we're with the toddlers, and you can't get out of this little bit we're in unless an adult presses the button, which is high enough for an adult to press.

'Anyway a teenager, I thought he was fine playing where he is and teenagers obviously pressed the button and he's gone out, now he's out by the sheep now I'm sort of in the play bit.

'It's all covered and she's gone, "where's Jack?" and I've gone, "he's just... out by the sheep by the looks of it!" So there was a bit of a panic, but all good he didn't go too far.'
