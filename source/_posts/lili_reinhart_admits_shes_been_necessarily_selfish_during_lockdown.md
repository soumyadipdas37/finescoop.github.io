Lili Reinhart has been putting herself first during COVID-19 lockdown.

The 24-year-old star explained why she's had to be 'necessarily selfish' for a piece in Self Magazine where she opened up about her self-care and sleep habits. 

'I’ve been kinda selfish—necessarily selfish—throughout this pandemic,' Reinhart said.

Priorities: Lili Reinhart got candid in a piece for Self magazine, admitting she's had to be 'selfish' in small ways to make sure she's taking care of herself

Reinhart wasn't talking about being unkind, but rather making herself her biggest priority.

She went on: 'Maybe that sounds worse than it is, but what I mean by that is just putting myself as a priority when it comes to my mental health and taking care of myself, whatever that means, whatever that looks like.'

Lili, who split with Riverdale co-star Cole Sprouse at the beginning of 2020, also explained how grief has been a big part of her quarantine experience - for more reason than one.

Putting things in perspective, the Ohio native said: 'I think grief is the hardest emotion a human can feel, and there’s a lot of it going on right now, especially with the Black Lives Matter movement and the massive loss of human lives that we’re dealing with when it comes to COVID.'

Still a smile: The Riverdale actress wasn't talking about being unkind but rather making sure you are being good to yourself and not putting other people ahead of yourself. 'What I mean by that is just putting myself as a priority when it comes to my mental health and taking care of myself, whatever that means, whatever that looks like'

'Grief seems to be an appropriate word for how a lot of us are feeling, and I think that’s why I’ve tried to not let this time go to waste,' Lili continued. 'I’ve definitely realized how valuable this time is. 

'It’s rare that I get this time to just kind of be, and think, and write, and feel, and I’m trying not to take advantage of that, but to really heal myself from past trauma, from current trauma'

She didn't directly refer to the breakup, but did say: 'A lot of stuff has been going on for me over the past couple months on a personal note. But it’s all necessary. It’s necessary work that I have to do on myself in order to grow as a human being.'

Self-care is even more important for Lili after heading back to Vancouver, Canada to resume shooting on Riverdale, which stopped production in March after a team member was exposed to the novel coronavirus.

Grieving: Lili, who split with Riverdale co-star Cole Sprouse in January, said grief has been a big part of her quarantine experience - for more reason than one. 'Grief seems to be an appropriate word for how a lot of us are feeling, and I think that’s why I’ve tried to not let this time go to waste'

Though admittedly 'lucky' to be on the show, she expressed misgivings about returning north of the border to film her popular series in a Nylon profile published earlier this month.

Lili has said she’s less than thrilled about the idea, as it means she 'cannot leave Canada' and won’t be able to visit her family for Thanksgiving in November. 

'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn’t feel good. You can’t go home for Thanksgiving, can’t visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f*****.' 

Lili and her costars are now finishing filming the final three episodes of season four, before beginning immediately on season five, which while take place seven years in the future as they leave their high school days behind them.

Prior to the shoot they had to quarantine separately for two weeks. They'll be filming through Christmas.
