A giant mural of Tyson Fury smashing Deontay Wilder has been commissioned by the Gypsy King as the reigning WBC heavyweight champion gears up for his trilogy bout against the Bronze Bomber. 

The 32-year-old blitzed the previously undefeated champion in Las Vegas earlier this year to leave fans in doubt as to who was the superior of the two arch rivals. 

Wilder has triggered an immediate rematch clause and the pair are set to meet for a third time later this year, with Fury looking to win once again and move a step closer to a huge bout with Anthony Joshua.

And the popular Brit has revealed the impressive creation at his gym as he prepares for the upcoming bout against his 35-year-old rival.

The mural, which was completed by Liverpool artist John Culshaw, shows Fury landing a big right hand on Wilder while splatters of Wilder's blood trickle down his neck in the evocative image.  

'So I've got me mural done, in my gym; the Tyson Fury Foundation,' the Gypsy King said in a short clip on his Instagram story.

'Boom! Have that, Wilder! Haha.

'What a painting, John. Fair play, that is impressive. Very impressive.'

Recent reports suggest that Fury and Wilder will meet in the United States for their third and final match up, with the showdown set for the Raiders Stadium in Las Vegas.

The new arena, which cost £1.5bn to build and has a 65,000-seat capacity, may host a small amount of fans amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Fury's US promotor, Bob Arum, has bold plans to see the stadium filled at 25% of its capacity come fight night. 

'That's what we're moving ahead on, on all fronts, with the security, with the virus, and everything,' he told ESPN.
