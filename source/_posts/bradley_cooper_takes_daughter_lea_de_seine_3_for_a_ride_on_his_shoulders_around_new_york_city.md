Just days ago he was seen strutting around Encino, California, soaked in fake blood for his part in Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film.

But on Thursday, Bradley Cooper, 45, cut a far more presentable figure, with the dashing leading man playing doting dad to daughter Lea De Seine, 3, in New York City.

The A Star Is Born director carried his only child on his shoulders for the outing in NYC's West Village. 

Daddy duty! On Thursday, Bradley Cooper, 45, played doting dad to daughter Lea De Seine, 3, in New York City

Cooper cut a dashing, albeit casual, figure in a white T-shirt, khaki pants and flip flops.

The Hangover hunk accessorized with a cap, shades and a white face mask.

The daughter he shares with  supermodel ex Irina Shayk went with a pink color theme for her adorable outfit, as she rode on her 6ft1in dad's shoulders.

Cooper revealed how he has been spending quarantine with his mother Gloria Campano and daughter Lea while speaking with Interview Magazine.

 Bradley also said he had been 'running a one-man preschool' for Lea, whom he has been teaching how to swim in their bathtub.

'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house. My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over,' he said.

'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.'

Bradley and Irina split last year after four years together.
