These adorable pictures show a new mother gorilla playing with her newborn baby. 

A year on from losing her first-born baby, nine-year-old Kala is pictured playing with her cheeky baby, yet unnamed, at Bristol Zoo.   

The cheeky tot - born on August 19 - gazed up at its mother with adoring eyes, but not before trying to steal some of her lunch. 

Luckily, hungry Kala manages to convince her baby that a cuddle with her and some milk is a much better option than her own snack.

The pair's beautiful bond was captured on camera by a zoo photographer when the baby was less than two weeks old, as Kala brought her out to enjoy the sunshine. 

Bristol Zoo revealed that nine-year-old Kala gave birth naturally overnight while the father Jock was just a few metres away and the rest of the family troop nearby. 

Keepers arrived to find the little gorilla nestling in its mother's arms.  

Curator of Mammals at Bristol Zoo Lynsey Bugg said: 'We are all thrilled. There is something very special about seeing a newborn baby gorilla, they are such an iconic and charismatic species.'

Last September, Kala's baby died when it was just under a week old. 

The baby girl was delivered by emergency caesarean section due to Kala having a low-lying placenta which blocked the birth canal and prevented the baby from being born naturally. 

Despite keepers and in-house vets closing the Zoo's Gorilla House to give the mother and baby time and space to bond, the baby sadly died just a few days after failing to thrive. 

Fortunately, Kala's pregnancy this time around has been much happier, and the new mum and her bundle of joy clearly already enjoy a beautiful bond.

The baby gorilla joins a troop of six gorillas at the zoo, which are part of a breeding programme to help safeguard the future of western lowland gorillas.

Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered primates from Cameroon, in the west Central Africa region.

Many gorillas in the wild are shot by hunters for the bush meat trade which thrives in towns and cities.

Bristol Zoo Gardens is actively involved in ensuring there is a strong population in human care.

Lowland gorillas, which can weigh up to 400lb as adults and stand 6ft tall, are usually not aggressive - unless disturbed.
