She shot to fame back in 2006, when she appeared in the seventh series of classic reality television show Big Brother.

And Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, 41, showed she remains a dab hand at captivating an audience over the weekend, when she put on an eye-popping display during a trip to the beach in Bournemouth.

The erstwhile reality star hit the shoreline in a skimpy gold thong as she was seen playing with an adorable white pooch while soaking up the late summer rays.

Aisleyne's outing comes after she revealed she's got her heart set on finding a partner and having a baby in the near future. 

Back in June, she spoke with new! magazine about her family ambitions and why she was thriving in lockdown, jokingly calling herself 'Jesus' because she had been helping deliver food to hospitals and hospices around the country. 

Famously straight talking, the reality star didn't mince her words as she laid out her post-lockdown plans. 

Aisleyne has tragically suffered three miscarriages and a stillborn in her bid to have a child, with doctors confirming she suffers from rhesus negative, a rare blood disease that threatens her chances of carrying a baby full-term.

'I'm pushed for time here so let's just find the guy, get the ring, have the baby and worry about the wedding later'.
