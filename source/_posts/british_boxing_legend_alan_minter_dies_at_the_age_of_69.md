British boxing legend Alan Minter has died of cancer at the age of 69.

Minter was a former world middleweight champion after winning the the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine titles from Vito Antuofermo in March 1980 before being dethroned by Marvin Hagler later that same year.

The Crawley-born Boxer died on Wednesday following his lengthy battle with cancer.

Minter who was born in 1951 and started boxing at a young age was called up to the 1972 Olympics which were held in Munich.

At the age of 21 he claimed a bronze medal and soon after turned professional.

Minter captured the British middleweight title in 1975 before then claiming the European belt two years later.

He would lose both belts before regaining them and was then deemed ready for a world title shot against then undisputed king Antuofermo. 

The Brit won by controversial split decision, but proved his status as champion by stopping Antuofermo in their rematch.

Minter's reign lasted three months before he was stopped by Hagler in three rounds which led to a riot at Wembley arena.

Boom Boom' Minter called a halt to his career in 1981 with a 39-9 record.
