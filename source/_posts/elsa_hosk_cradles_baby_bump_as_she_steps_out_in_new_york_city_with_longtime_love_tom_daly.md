She is expecting her firstborn child.

And Elsa Hosk cradled her burgeoning baby bump as she emerged from lockdown in New York City this Wednesday.

The 31-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel was out and about with her longtime love Tom Daly, a Danish sunglasses entrepreneur.

Elsa, who played basketball in her native Sweden before becoming a model, draped her bump in a loose-fitting black blazer.

She complemented her wrap with a pair of elegant split slacks that emphasized her enviably trim legs as she pounded the pavement.

Letting her luxurious blonde hair down, she accessorized with a black and white print handbag and slipped into highlighter green kitten heels.

She and her husband made sure to take the precaution of wearing masks whilst stepping out amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Stockholm native announced her pregnancy on Instagram this Tuesday by posting an elegant nude maternity photo-shoot.

Elsa was snapped by the photographer Sante D'Orazio for the pictures, in which she artfully held a white fur coat against her body.

She made sure that her wrap strategically fell where it would enable her to remain safely within the Instagram Community Guidelines. 

'Been keeping this angel in my belly a secret for a while..,' wrote Elsa, who rose to the title of Victoria's Secret Angel five years ago.

'Feeling beyond excited and lucky to be having a baby and begin the next chapter of life with the man of my dreams!!!!' she gushed.

The blonde bombshell also revealed how far along she was, dishing that she was 'Half way there' and tagging her man.

One of her comments was from her fellow pregnant Victoria's Secret Angel Romee Strijd who wrote that she 'Cant wait for playdates.' 

Elsa's baby news comes after it emerged that she has put her elegant two-bedroom SoHo apartment on the market for $3.5 million.
