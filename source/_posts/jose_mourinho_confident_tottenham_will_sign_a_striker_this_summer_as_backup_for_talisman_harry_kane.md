Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is confident he will sign a striker in the summer transfer window.

Mourinho is desperate to strengthen his armoury in attack and provide back up for Harry Kane, who scored 18 goals last season. 

Although the 57-year-old Tottenham boss did admit that the club are not in a position to 'go into the market and spend a fortune on players.'

The Portuguese manager said 'I want a striker,' at a news conference ahead of Spurs' Premier League opener against Everton on Sunday. 

He went on to say: 'But I want to make it very clear that the club - if you want to call it the club or the structure above me - knows I need a striker and they also want a striker.

'I believe we will get a striker, I honestly believe so.

'The team needs it for the balance of the squad. In this moment the squad is getting very balance and we have different options for different positions.

The Tottenham boss did say he is in a similar position to Jurgen Klopp and can't spend loads

'Especially after the gift that we had from UEFA and EFL that gives me after 20 years of football a unique experience of playing Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday for two consecutive weeks.

'We realise now more than ever that we need that balance.

'The other day Jurgen Klopp said Liverpool is not a club of oligarchs or belonging to countries. We are the same so we are not the kind of club that can go to the market and spend a fortune on players.' 

Tottenham fans have, however, put Daniel Levy under pressure to provide their team with a talented enough to help them in the Premier League, Europa League, and other cup competitions.

Should Kane be absent due to injury, Tottenham need a strong attacking option that can come off the bench and score goals in his place.  

The England striker would also benefit from some competition at training during his time at Tottenham. 

As it stands, Mourinho has only added only Matt Doherty, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Joe Hart to his ranks during the summer transfer window.
