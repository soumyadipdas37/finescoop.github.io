Lily Aldridge was among the star-studded lineup of presenters for the Academy of Country Music Awards' ceremony on Wednesday from Nashville, Tennessee. 

The 34-year-old supermodel made a very glamorous return to the red carpet, after the ongoing coronavirus outbreak halted glitzy premieres and public gatherings in mid-March. 

As she sported a flowing black and maroon gown, all eyes were on her thigh-high slit, which hovered several inches above her right knee.

In addition to flashing her sensational legs, the dress' daring opening allowed Lily to show off her opened-toed, jewel-encrusted stilettos. 

Her black belt emphasized her trim waist, as she opted to style her lustrous raven tresses in loose waves.  

Later in the evening, she presented Old Dominion with Group of the Year and stood several feet away from the five-member country music band, as they accepted their trophy.

While she did not wear a mask, as she called the group forward, all but one member of the band sported facial coverings, as they approached the stage. 

On Instagram, however, she posed in her ensemble with a white mask and put up two peace signs.

'First time out in A MINUTEEE,' the star captioned her series of snaps, which were taken outside of a private bus.

In her post, she thanked the show for inviting her, as well as her glam team, which included Marwa Bashir, Lindsay Doyle and Emma Jade Morrison. 

Additionally, Aldridge tagged a Nashville-based nail artist, named Annie, who goes by @gelhiigh on Instagram.

The manicurist was also responsible for doing the nails of country star, Marren Morris.
