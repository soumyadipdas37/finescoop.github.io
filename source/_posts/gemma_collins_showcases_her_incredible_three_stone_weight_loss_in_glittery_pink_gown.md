She was seen sporting a lavender and pink tie-dye hoodie which complemented her pink circular shades. 

Gemma priotised safety with a black face mask as she posed inside the iconic red telephone box. 

The TOWIE star added a designer touch with white Yeezy trainers.  

Gemma has shed three stone so far this year thanks to controversial Skinny Jabs.   

Talking to PlayOJO bingo earlier this month, Gemma said: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it. 

'It is a full programme, you get nutrition advice, nice recipes and guidance and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to lose weight.'

The television personality has previously come under fire for promoting the jab, which 'regulate the glucose level in your blood, allowing your body to use your stored fat for energy'.
