The clocks are set to go back Sunday, October 25, signalling the end of British Summer Time and those extra hours of sunlight.

Getting out of bed in the morning can be a challenge on those cold, dark mornings. But thankfully there's a solution. Hundreds of shoppers have deemed the FITFORT Alarm Clock Wake Up Light their favourite sunrise simulating alarm clock and it's just what you need to combat seasonal affective disorder.

Better yet: You don't have to fork out loads of money to bag this bedside gadget, as it's currently just £21.24 on Amazon - that's 15 per cent off.

A light-based alarm clock will help you on your way to becoming a morning person, or at the very least ensure that your morning gets off to the best start

Not only is the top-rated wake-up alarm clock from FITFORT incredibly sleek, but it's super functional, too. With the sunrise and sunset simulation, this clock gradually brightens and dims, so users can wake up with natural and gradual light and wind down with ease in the evening.

More than 2,000 reviewers have given the clock a perfect star rating, claiming it helps improve their mood and boost their energy levels.

Earning itself the number one top spot in Amazon's Wake-Up Lights category, shoppers say this clock is 'straightforward to set up' and 'an excellent buy', describing it a must-have 'for waking up and not feeling groggy'.

'I bought this wake-up light alarm clock in conjunction with a SAD lamp as I really suffer from low mood during the dark winter months,' wrote one five-star reviewer. 

'I was somewhat cynical about the alarm clock to begin with, but I am now waking up nice and early in a well-lit room (which then helps me to get my morning coffee and sit in front of my SAD lamp).'

'This alarm clock is amazing for anyone who wants a more peaceful way to wake up than your typical beeping alarm,' another shopper wrote, adding, 'Waking up to the sunrise light feature has really changed how anxious I used to feel when waking up. Now, I wake up much calmer and more gradual than before. It really helped my body clock.'

A third shopper agreed adding: 'Changed my sleeping pattern for the better. Very impressed with this gadget. I've always struggled to get up in the morning but with the gradual light and then alarm I've been jumping out of bed feeling ready to tackle the day.'

The FITFORT Alarm Clock Wake Up Light has buttons to adjust brightness and the duration of sunsets and sunrises.  

It boasts multiple light colour options and six natural and soothing sounds such as piano, waves, violin, croak and the traditional beep. Even better? It has additional features like FM radio, which you can set as an alarm too.
