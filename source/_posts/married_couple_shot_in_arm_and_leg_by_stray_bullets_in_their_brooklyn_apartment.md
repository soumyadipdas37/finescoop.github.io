A husband and wife were shot in their Brooklyn apartment by flying stray bullets that entered through the third-floor window of their home.

The couple was in their apartment in the Marcy Houses on Marcy Avenue and Park Ave in Bedford-Stuyvesant when a shooting broke out just before 10.40pm on Tuesday.

The shooter was firing indiscriminately at a gang rival on the street, police say.

The shooter struck their target, a man, but at least eight shots missed him.

'He was a real maniac. He was shooting at the guy down the block,' one anonymous witness said to the New York Daily News.

'There were eight, nine shots before [the gunman’s target] fell,' the source added.

Bullets entered the couple’s home and struck the man, 42, in the wrist and the wife, 46, in the leg.

Both were taken to Bellevue Hospital.

The shooter’s intended target ran into another building in the complex and the shooter fled in an unknown direction.

All three victims are expected to survive, and the shooter is on the loose, officials say.
