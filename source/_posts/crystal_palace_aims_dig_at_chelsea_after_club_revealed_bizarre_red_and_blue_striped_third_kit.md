Crystal Palace aimed a cheeky dig at Chelsea after the Blues revealed their new third kit with a striking resemblance to the South Londoners' classic design.

The club unveiled a bizarre new alternate shirt for the 2020-21 season with red and blue stripes as the club claimed it was 'inspired by the 1990s Ultramarine Air Max 180 and classic shirts of the past', using the hashtag #ItsaChelseaThing. 

But clearly far from impressed by Chelsea's tagline, Palace hit back on their social media page, replying: '#ItsNotThoughIsit.

Chelsea have revealed their new third kid for the 2020-21 season with blue and red stripes 

The Blues used the hashtag #ItsaChelseaThing but Crystal Palace hit back on social media 

The Eagles have become known for using a red and blue stripes for much of their history

Supporters have been left horrified by the unusual new jersey with the club making a departure from their normal colours of blue and white, with some calling it 'the worst in our history' and many pointing of the similarities with Palace's kit.

One fan was quick to ask: 'What did we do wrong to deserve this?', while another said it was 'hideous' and 'comfortably our worst kit of all time'.

Another user said he felt sorry for the club's five new big signings who will be wearing the strip next season.











'So many good signings and they all have to play their first game in this hideous shirt.'

And one posted: 'Fire whoever designed this. Worst kit in the history of chelsea football club.'

Some questioned whether the kit was a mistake and actually supposed to be Palace's kit for the new season. 

'Shouldn't this be meant for Crystal Palace not Chelsea?' asked one supporter, while another said: 'What in the Crystal Palace is going on here,' with a crying emoji.

Palace have long been synonymous with a classic red and blue kit with stripes. They first featured the design in the 1930s and it has been a constant on their shirts since the 1970s.

Chelsea's new kit will be worn by the likes of Kai Havertz, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva after completing deals to join Frank Lampard's side this summer. Despite a negative reception from supporters, the club will hope it brings good luck to the team this season as the Blues look to mount a title challenge. 

The Stamford Bridge outfit have spent over £200million on transfer business this summer as they attempt to challenge champions Liverpool at the top of the table.
