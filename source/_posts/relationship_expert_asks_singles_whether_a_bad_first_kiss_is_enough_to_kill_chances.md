 If the first kiss is bad is it an automatic deal-breaker?

An Australian relationship coach has asked men and women whether a bad 'first kiss' has ever turned them off dating someone - and the responses are divided.    

Expert Louanne Ward, from Perth in Western Australia, posed the controversial question in her Facebook group She Said, He Said, calling on members to decide how important that first stage of intimacy is for the overall success of the relationship. 

Some people said that kissing 'determines a lot' and can be a 'real turn off' if executed poorly, while others said people can be taught to be better lip lockers over time and it's not a signal that things won't work out.

'A kiss is the most important thing for sensual connection. For me it the holds the most meaning in intimacy. If the kiss is good then the rest is even better,' one woman said. 

'I'm afraid I have said goodbye after lacklustre and sloppy first kisses. If you're bad in this area the relationship won't progress, it's a deal-breaker for me - straight to the friend zone at best,' said another.

A third added: 'Yes. It's very important. You can tell more about a person from that first kiss than you can from two hours of conversation'.

Others were adamant that they could 'teach' their prospective partner to be a better kisser and would give their date another chance.

'I wouldn't stop seeing someone because of the actual kiss. But I would not revisit the date if there was a general lack of chemistry or weird vibe,' one lady said.

'I haven't said no to dating someone because of the first kiss. If bad kisses continue then I find another excuse to leave,' a man remarked.

A third said: 'I wouldn't say no if the fist kiss was bad or even if it was bad breath. I would nicely tell them that kissing is a very important part of a relationship and I'd offer to help them out a bit'.

While the group members were ultimately divided in their approach to the question, Louanne agreed that the first kiss was a pivotal moment for the pending relationship.

'I agree, intimacy is an important part of connection. If you don't have an intimate connection you end up in the friend zone,' she said.

'This is why the right time and place is so important. If it's miss-timed for one person it can ruin the moment you may never get again.'

She said those that understood the power of a kiss were unlikely going to date someone who was lacking in that department. 

'When you know how a kiss can move through your body you understand how much power it has. It is more than a meeting of the lips. A kiss can touch your soul,' she said.
