The Justin Bieber protégé is also focusing on her personal life, as she continues to fuel rumours of a new relationship. 

Earlier this month, Madison stepped out for lunch with TikTok star Nick, with whom she's been spending time lately.

The New York-born singer has recently been promoting her debut studio album Life Support.

She recently told NME how mental health inspired the album: 'I was going through a really tough time when we were making this album. 

'I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I was in and out of dark mental states and in therapy three times a week.' 

Beer said of her team: 'They were just there to be a support system and that was another support system for me.

'I genuinely believe that the time I was creating my album and was genuinely suicidal, they were intertwined for a reason.'
