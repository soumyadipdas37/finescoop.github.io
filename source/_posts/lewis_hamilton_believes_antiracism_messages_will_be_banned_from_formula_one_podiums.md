The FIA is expected to tell Formula 1 drivers that only race suits will be allowed on the podium, after Lewis Hamilton wore a shirt with an anti-racism message at the Tuscan Grand Prix. 

His shirt bore the slogans 'Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,' and 'Say her name,' referencing a black woman who was shot dead by police in her home in Kentucky earlier this year.  

According to the BBC, Hamilton said: 'I did something that has never really happened in F1 and obviously they will stop it moving forwards.

The FIA is expected to rule that anti-racism clothing will not be allowed on Formula 1 podiums

'I haven't spoken to them but I heard tomorrow [Friday] they will come out with a new ruling saying what you can and cannot do.' 

The drivers will be given a briefing after Friday's practice session, in which the governing body is expected to clarify that anti-racism clothing will be permitted before the race and during the pre-race demonstration.

However, the ruling will say that podium should be 'preserved as a neutral space.'  

Hamilton has long been fighting for more diversity in the sport, and to try and combat racism

Hamilton says he doesn't regret anything, and will continue to work to try and educate people

'I don't regret a single moment of [the protest]. I usually follow my heart and do what I feel is right,' said Hamilton.

'People talk about sport not being a place for politics. Ultimately, it's a human rights issue and in my opinion that is something we should be pushing towards.

'We have a huge collective group of amazing people who watch our sport from multiple different backgrounds and cultures. We should definitely be pushing positive messages towards them, especially for equality.'

None of the police officers involved in the shooting of Taylor have been charged with her killing, drawing the ire of many people around the world.

Former F1 driver Vitaly Petrov hit out at Hamilton and claimed racism doesn't exist in Russia

World champion Hamilton says he will continue to work with F1 and the FIA to make sure they are doing what's best to try and educate people over the issue of racism. 

However, not everyone is pleased with the way Hamilton is trying to convey his message. Former F1 rival Vitaly Petrov branded his gestures as 'too much,' saying that the US government 'is well aware of these problems already.'

He then bizarrely went on to claim that racism doesn't exist in Russia, and said: 'And let's say a driver admits to being gay - will they come out with a rainbow flag and urge everyone to become gay as well?'
