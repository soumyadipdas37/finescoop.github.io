A new book has revealed how Zlatan Ibrahimovic clashed with Sweden team-mates throughout his international career, including before his incredible four-goal salvo against England in 2012.

The Swedish superstar stole the show during a 4-2 friendly win in Stockholm, scoring an infamous long-range bicycle kick.

But the buildup to the game was far from ideal, with new revelations that the AC Milan striker told his team-mates: 'What the hell am I playing in this f****** national team for?'.

The book, written by Swedish journalist Olof Lundh, details how Ibrahimovic went to war with his compatriots at half-time during the friendly. 

Sweden found themselves 2-1 down at the interval, and Rasmus Elm allegedly found himself at the end of a verbal volley from Ibrahimovic.

An excerpt claims: 'Zlatan was terribly hard on Rasmus and broke him down even though he tried to respond. Hamren (manager, Erik) just stood by the side and finally he said: "Rasmus, now that's enough". 

'There, Hamren lost many players and also those who were close to him.'

The book claims that Ibrahimovic was treated differently to other players, which caused irritation throughout the squad.

One player reveals: 'When I arrived five minutes late, I was told, "Where the hell have you been?" If Zlatan arrived late, there were no problems. 

'The group accepted 100 percent that Zlatan had a little freer reins, but there must be the same rules about times for everyone and that was not the case.'

Ibrahimovic has not played for his country since retiring after playing at Euro 2016

It is alleged that there became a 'depressing culture of silence' around the side, with Zlatan surrounded by 'yes-sayers'.

Ibrahimovic has not played for his country since Euro 2016.

In a distinguished international career he scored 62 times, earning 116 caps in the process.
