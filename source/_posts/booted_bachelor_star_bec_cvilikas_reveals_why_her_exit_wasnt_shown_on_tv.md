Locky Gilbert sent Bec Cvilikas and Izzy Sharman-Firth packing during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor.

And now Bec, 25, has revealed why her exit wasn't shown on TV, like Izzy's was.

Speaking to the KIIS FM Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday, the senior beauty consultant revealed what really happened after the rose ceremony and said she and Locky actually shared a sweet and final goodbye.

During the episode, Bec is seen embracing Locky at the rose ceremony before walking out. 

Izzy was then seen being given the flick, before Locky walked her to the car.   

'I literally just walked out the door hey,' Bec said. 

How sweet: 'I gave a really nice goodbye and we had a moment,' Bec said. Pictured is Bachelor Locky Gilbert at the rose ceremony

'[Like] Yeah, see ya! There's a lot more you didn't see. I gave a really nice goodbye and we had a moment.'

She added about the way things were edited: 'And do you know what, I'm thinking, maybe I wasn't emotional enough.' 

It comes after Bec told The Courier Mail that she never realised that Locky had such strong 'connections' with finalists Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska.

She also called the 31-year-old former Australian Survivor star a 'cheeky bugger' after watching the show air on TV.

'I was never aware of his connections with others,' Bec said, adding that she wasn't 'surprised' she got the flick after seeing how close he was to Irena and Bella.

She added: 'I watched it back and thought, "You cheeky bugger." You can see he has really strong feelings for the others.'

Despite also having a strong connection with Locky, Bec had no intention of telling him she loved him like the others did, because her feelings weren't that developed. 

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10

Blindsided? It comes after Bec told The Courier Mail that she never realised that Locky had such strong 'connections' with finalists Bella and Irena
