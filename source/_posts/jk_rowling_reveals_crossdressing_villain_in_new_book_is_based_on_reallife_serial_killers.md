JK Rowling has revealed the cross-dressing villain in her new book is based on real-life serial killers Jerry Brudos and Russell Williams after facing another transphobia row. 

The Harry Potter author released Troubled Blood under her crime-writing pseudonym Robert Galbraith earlier this week.

The thriller sees detective Cormoran Strike try to work out what happened to missing GP Margot Bamborough.

He fears she fell victim to Dennis Creed, who has been dubbed a 'transvestite serial killer' for murdering his victims while wearing female clothing.

An early review of the 900-page book by The Daily Telegraph - in which the critic states the novel's 'moral seems to be: never trust a man in a dress' - sparked immediate backlash online.

Furious readers rushed to Twitter to share their thoughts, making #RIPJKRowling trend in the UK.

However, she has since clarified that she drew inspiration for the character from Brudos, who murdered four women in Oregon between 1968 and 1969 and had a fetish for women's shoes, and Williams, who broke into 82 women's houses to steal underwear, which then led to sexual assault and two counts of rape and murder.

On the Robert Galbraith website, responding to a question about the book's themes, she wrote: 'The suspects in Dr Bamborough’s disappearance include a womanising patient who seems to have developed feelings for her, a passive-aggressive husband who wanted her to quit her job to become a full-time mother, and a sadistic serial killer active in the 60s and 70s, who was loosely based on real life killers Jerry Brudos and Russell Williams – both master manipulators who took trophies from their victims.'

It comes as the book soared to the top of Amazon's best seller list, ahead of the likes of The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman and Captain Tom Moore's autobiography, Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day. 

While many criticised, others said the book - which came out on Tuesday - is not transphobic at all and over-eager detractors should read it before jumping to conclusions.

Observer journalist Nick Cohen wrote: 'I've read the latest Strike novel, and the claim it's anti-trans is total sh***. 

'I can't tell you why it is total sh*** without giving away the ending. So until you read it yourself, which you should, you will just have to trust me: this is total sh***.'

A Twitter user called Steve replied stating: 'But when you combine it with all the negative stereotyping she's done about trans women, it shows a clear pattern. 

'It's not anti-trans as such but it does play into the fears that trans women are cis males looking to spy on women.'

Cohen replied: 'Read the bloody book why don't you?' 

Piers Morgan added: 'The fact #RIPJKRowling is trending says all you need to know about the woke brigade - they're nastier and more viciously intolerant than anyone they preach about.'

In June, Rowling hit the headlines after she mocked an online article using the words 'people who menstruate' instead of 'women'. 

She was hit by what she described as 'relentless attacks' after she wrote: 'I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?'

The acclaimed novelist then penned a deeply personal essay to address the controversy, revealing she was sexually assaulted in her 20s and saying she still feels the scars of 'domestic violence' in her first marriage. 

Rowling's remarks sparked backlash from a range of stars including Ron actor Rupert Grint, Emma Watson who played Hermione in the film franchise, Daniel Radcliffe who played Harry and Eddie Redmayne, who stars in her Fantastic Beasts films.
