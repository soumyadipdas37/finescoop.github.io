When Pose returns for its third season sometime next year on FX, there will be another big time jump. 

The first season was set in 1987, though it was revealed that the second season was set three years later in 1990.

Series creator Steven Canals spoke with TV Guide on Thursday, where he revealed the show will jump ahead four more years to 1994.

'Thematically it's much of the same — our heroes navigating New York and this time it's New York of 1994," Canals revealed. 

He also teased one of the big story arcs of Season 3 is Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) finding love. 

'A large part of Blanca's arc for the season is the push and pull of being both a partner and a mom. How do you balance all these multiple roles?' Canals added.

Canals added that Blanca, 'has always been so devoted and focused on her children...She's finally focusing on her herself and going for her goals in a way we're really never seen for her.'

'We'll be exploring the ripple effects [of that choice]. How does that then impact her children?'  he added.

Jeremy Pope, who is nominated for Best Actor in a Limited Series or Movie Emmyfor Hollywood, has signed on to play Blanca's love interest, Christopher.

Canals added that the show's writing staff was 'pretty far along' in writing the third season when COVID-19, but now scenes have to be re-worked to make them safe while shooting amid a pandemic.

'How are we going to do the balls? Do we wait and shoot the balls later in our production cycle when hopefully the restrictions have loosened up some?' he asked.

'A lot of it is a question mark and we're having to figure it out as we go,' Canals added, before teasing what the soundtrack for the new season may be.

Canals added that the blend of funk, soul, disco, R&B, and pop in the first two seasons will be replaced with, 'a deeper foray into the R&B and hip-hop of the mid-90s. 

He also teased a legendary guest star that is coming aboard for the third season, though Canals would not name names.

'We have some exciting casting this season. People are definitely going to gag when they hear who we have coming up,' he said.
