Fendi presented their Women’s and Men’s Spring Summer 2021 Collections today in front of friends, family and celebs, including pop star Rita Ora, Irish actor Paul Mescal and British singer Bakar.

'Reflections' is a patchwork of memories designed by the only family member still working at the business, Silvia Venturini Fendi. 

'Time spent with family – generations reunited at home in Rome – is a catalyst for quiet introspection: at the window or in the garden, watching the world go by,' said the press release.

The color palette of next season's offerings consists of neutrals including wheat, milk, honey, black and white, amidst sky blue, bubblegum pink and cardinal red.

Linen, was a main fabric used. Combined with cotton, feathers, fur and eiderdown quilting, it conjures images of embroidered bedding and tableware – maternal souvenirs passed down from mother to child.  

Windows, both subtle and extreme, are a dominant motif upon garments in a game of transparency and texture throughout.

The collections explore traditions from the luxury label stripped bare – from boutis satin quilting to ajouré flowers that expose skin to create layers of light and shade

Founded in Rome in 1925, Fendi is known for its leather goods such as the Baguette.  

The handbags for spring do not disappoint. Embroidered silk veils that look like nona's doilies float over Baguette and Peekaboo bags in floral fur and cotton ajouré or quilted FF logo leather. 

Market baskets in recycled PVC, stretch lattice frame totes, picnic baskets and canvas luggage are all present to elevate the everyday ensembles of woman around the world.

The ‘hand in hand’ Baguette project celebrates a collaboration with local artisans across Italy, including the Abruzzo and Marche regions came down the runway.

While their handbags have become iconic, their shoes are just as enviable. Models walked the catwalk in woven boots, elastic pumps, and rattan pool slides.
