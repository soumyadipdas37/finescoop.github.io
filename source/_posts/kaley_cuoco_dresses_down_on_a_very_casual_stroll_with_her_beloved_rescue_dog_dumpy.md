She has an estimated worth of over $50 million thanks to her money-spinning role playing Penny Hofstadter on the hugely successful The Big Bang Theory. 

But Kaley Cuoco looked a million miles away from the celebrity scene in Hollywood on Sunday, as she cut a very casual figure while out in New York City.

However, her beloved pup Dumpy still looked every inch the Beverly Hills Chihuahua, as he was pushed around in a pram for the day by Kaley, 34.

The actress wore an over-sized ensemble as she enjoyed some fresh air with her sister Briana Cuoco. 

Briana, 31, also went for a comforting outfit as she rocked a pair of large khaki pants, and a plaid jacket. 

Kaley is a well-known dog lover, recently having started an Instagram account for Dumpy, titled 'Dumps Does NY'.

The bio for the page reads, 'Dump Truck aka Dumpy - I’m a tiny rescued senior whose life changed over night! My mom is @kaleycuoco, she never misses a moment to document hilarious adventures! Woof woof!'

The actress is in town to finish up production of her latest project, television series The Flight Attendant. 

As with all other projects, production was stalled on the show in the spring as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

And just the night before her dog walk sighting, Cuoco was seen on the set of the new series, shooting exteriors in downtown Manhattan.

The new dramatic thriller will follow the titular flight attendant (Cuoco) as she wakes up hungover in a hotel room in Dubai, with a dead body lying next to her – and no recollection of the night before.
