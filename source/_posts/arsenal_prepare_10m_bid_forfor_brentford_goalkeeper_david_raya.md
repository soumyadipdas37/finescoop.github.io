Arsenal are reportedly set to waste no time in addressing their goalkeeping situation and make a £10million bid for Brentford's David Raya.

Mikel Arteta's side are on the verge of shaking on a £20m agreement to see Emiliano Martinez switch to Aston Villa this summer, to become first choice at Villa Park.

And Arsenal will then directly invest half of these funds into signing Raya from Thomas Frank's Bees, according to the Sun.

The 25-year-old Raya is said to be keen to play Premier League football, though would be brought in as understudy to Bernd Leno.

Arteta has already decided the German is to be his No.1 stopper, despite Martinez starring in both recent FA Cup final and Community Shield successes.

It is reported that the knock-on effect would see Brentford look at Charlton’s Dillon Phillips as a replacement.

On Saturday Arsenal officially kicked off their new Premier League campaign with a convincing 3-0 win over newly promoted Fulham.

Mikel Arteta knows he will receive a cash injection to transfer funds as a result of the deal

Leno was back between the sticks for the Gunners, and kept a clean sheet behind new central defender Gabriel.

Martinez was out of the squad for the game, instead preparing for his medical as he edges closer to Villa Park. 

The Argentinian has agreed a long-term contract believed to be worth around £60,000-a-week to join Dean Smith’s team, and will represent a injection into the transfer kitty for Arsenal.
