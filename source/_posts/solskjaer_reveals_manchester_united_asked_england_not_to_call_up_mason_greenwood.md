Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed the club asked England not to select Mason Greenwood before he was thrown out of Gareth Southgate's squad for breaking Covid-19 protocols. 

Greenwood made his England debut during the international break earlier this month following some excellent performances for the United first-team. 

But the 18-year-old was thrown out of the Three Lions squad along with Phil Foden for inviting Icelandic girls into his and the Manchester City star's hotel room while the England squad were in a Covid-19 bio-secure bubble.

But Solskjaer says he did all he could to try and ensure Greenwood had a rest after the season and was unhappy the FA put him up for media duties when with the national team.

'Yeah, of course I speak to Mason and I've spoken to Mason,' Solskjaer said on Friday morning ahead of his side's game against Crystal Palace.

'Of course what we speak about and discuss will be between the two of us. The kid had a fantastic season. He's just come through.

'I've worked and the club have worked and all the staff here worked really hard to... when we gave Mason enough time on the pitch, when we gave him exposure in the media. Then you come to the end of the season and we've had less than two weeks off and he's called up to the national team.

'I have to be honest enough to say I tried my best to give him a rest over the summer. That the club we asked specifically and pointed out that he should have had a rest.

'He needs it mentally and physically after that season he had. First thing that happens is 1) he's called up, and 2) he's right there in the press.

'We've done whatever we can to protect him and I will keep on helping him. I know that when he comes back into the daily routine of the club and what we do to him, he'll be fine.'
