Former Biggest Loser trainer Michelle Bridges announced her split from long-term partner Steve 'Commando' Willis at the start of the year.

And while the exes continue to co-parent their four-year-old son, Axel, Michelle tellingly didn't mention Steve in her Father's Day Instagram post on Sunday.

She shared a photo of herself and Axel, which was likely taken in the paddock of her home in the NSW Southern Highlands.

'Happy Fathers Day! Spending today with this human is a blessing,' she wrote in the caption.

'Have a great day to all the Dads, Step Dads, Father Figures, Mentors and caregivers.' 

It comes after Steve, 44, recently spoke about fatherhood and being a single dad to his four children, whom he shares with three different mothers.

He told The Daily Telegraph on Friday that he prioritises talking about his ex-partners in a 'positive light' for the sake of the children. 

'My children are their mother and me and [you need] to be mindful of that part within them and talk of the other parent in a positive light because otherwise children start to question their identity,' Steve said.

'You want them to focus on just being the age that they are,' he added.

Steve's four children include his eldest daughter Brianna, 21, from an early relationship; daughter Ella, 12, and son Jack, nine, from his relationship with ex-partner Froso; and son Axel, four, whom he shares with Michelle Bridges. 

Steve and Michelle began dating in 2015, after splitting from their respective partners. They announced their split in January this year.

Following their break-up, Michelle was arrested for drink driving on Australia Day and fined $750.

Her driver's licence was also disqualified for three months, after she pleaded guilty to mid-range drink driving and apologised outside court at the time. 

She tearfully said: 'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment and the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'
