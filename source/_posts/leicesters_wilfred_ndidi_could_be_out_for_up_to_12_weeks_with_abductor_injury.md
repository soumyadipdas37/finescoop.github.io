Leicester have been dealt a huge injury blow after boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Wilfred Ndidi could be out for up to 12 weeks with an abductor injury.

The Nigerian international, who has been filling in as a defender in the absence of Jonny Evans, was crocked in Sunday's Premier League win over Burnley. 

Ndidi was forced to miss Leicester's 2-0 Carabao Cup defeat by Arsenal in midweek and afterwards Rodgers confirmed the player may need to have surgery.

Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers fears the Nigerian international could miss up to 12 weeks 

'It is an abductor injury, it may have come off the bone which could be a nasty injury,' said Rodgers, who's side have claimed top spot in the Premier League with back-to-back wins over West Brom and Burnley. 

'We will wait to see if he needs an operation, if so it will be 12 weeks.'

Ndidi has been utilised in central defence for the first two games as Leicester, with Papy Mendy taking Ndidi's regular midfield holding role, but surgery could see him now miss almost the first half of his side's campaign.  

Rodgers' side next face a huge test against Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday.
