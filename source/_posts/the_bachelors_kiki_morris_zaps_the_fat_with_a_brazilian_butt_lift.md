Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris split from Bachelor in Paradise bad boy Ciarran Stott earlier this year.

And on Saturday, the 33-year-old looked to be getting her revenge body in check.

In footage shared to her Instagram Stories, the glamour model-turned-reality star underwent a non-surgical Brazilian Butt Lift to 'zap the fat' on her derrière and thighs.

Bottoms up! The Bachelor's Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris, 33, 'zapped the fat' with a Brazilian Butt Lift, showing off the procedure on her Instagram Stories on Saturday 

Wearing a white T-shirt and a black G-string, a beautician was seen using a Cavitation machine to firm the skin around her buttocks and the front of her thighs.

The procedure, which she had done at Beautylicious by Sophie, costs $360.  

At least four sessions are recommended to not only sculpt the buttocks, but also migrate fat to the area and assist in the reduction of cellulite.

Kiki later showed off part of the results, drawing attention to her enviably trim pins in a plunging black top teamed with a matching mini-skirt.

Posing for a mirror selfie ahead of a night out, she added sky-high heels, styled her locks out, and enhanced her striking facial features with glamorous makeup. 

It all comes about eight months after Kiki had her heart broken by love rat Ciarran.

Over: Kiki split from Bachelor in Paradise bad boy Ciarran Stott (pictured) earlier this year 

Kiki and Ciarran had started dating on the third season of Bachelor in Paradise, which was filmed in Fiji late last year.

Right before the finale, Ciarran told Kiki he was in love with her and wanted them to leave the show together without going through the formality of a rose ceremony.

Unfortunately, the couple split just a few weeks after returning to Australia.

Ciarran, who rose to fame on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette, apparently 'ghosted' Kiki and moved from Sydney to Melbourne.
