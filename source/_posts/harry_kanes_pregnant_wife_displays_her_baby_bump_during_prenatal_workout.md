The online personality teamed her sporty crop top and matching leggings with box-fresh white trainers. 

Kate looked as radiant as ever with her blonde tresses scraped into a bun at the back of her head. 

The fitness instructor focused on toning her glutes as she stepped up on boxes, and did hip thrusts.

Kate gave herself an all-over body workout with ball slams before further toning her arms by pulling on weighted equipment.

Harry and Kate are already parents to their two daughters Ivy Jane, three, and Vivienne Jane, two. 

In July, footballer Harry shared an intimate look at their virtual gender reveal where he kicked an inflatable football filled with blue smoke. 

The Spurs star, 26, captioned the video with: 'We are having a Boy,' followed by heart eyes emoji and a blue heart. Kate shared the same clip, adding a simple blue heart emoji.

In the clip, the couple Zoomed their nearest and dearest as they asked them to guess whether it was a girl or a boy.

Harry then went to a goal post, which had a huge inflatable ball hanging off it, and kicked a football at it which exploded and released blue air. The footballer met Kate while they were at school.

He proposed in July 2017 when the childhood sweethearts were away on holiday in Barbados.

At the time, the England captain joked to his partner he would not cry on his wedding day and that he would only shed tears if England won a trophy. 

He said: 'I always wind my missus up that I'd cry if we won a trophy with England. And she said if you don't cry when I walk down the aisle then she won't go through with it!

'I'm not a crier, I'm not someone who cries a lot. My missus has probably never seen me cry. So we'll have to see what comes first.'
