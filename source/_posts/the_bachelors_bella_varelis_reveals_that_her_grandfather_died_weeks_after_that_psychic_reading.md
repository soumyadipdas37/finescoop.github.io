During Wednesday nigh't episode of the show, psychic medium Alison Maiden informed the reality star that she was sensing the spirit of an older man with cancer.

'Overwhelmed and beyond grateful for the love and messages I've been receiving. Unfortunately, my grandfather did end up passing away a couple weeks later,' she wrote. 

The reality star explained that she was able 'be home' with her family when it happened due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. 

'And due to the covid lockdown, I thankfully got to be home with my family and know he will always be looking over me.' 

She went on to say that the psychic reading was an 'emotional whirlwind' but she was lucky that Locky Gilbert was there to 'support' her.

'This moment was such an emotional whirlwind for me and I wasn't expecting Locky to come and find me, but having him there was exactly the support I needed' she told her fans. 

On Wednesday night's episode Bella broke down into tears after hearing Allison's psychic reading. 

'I have an older man in the spirit world here. I'm getting a feeling it's someone with cancer - he's telling me,' she told the brunette.

The look on Bella's face quickly crumbled, as she responded: 'My grandfather, he has cancer... I'm not sure if he's passed. He had lung cancer before I left [to film for the show].'

Speaking to the producers, a crushed Bella said: 'The way Alison spoke about my grandfather made me think that he may have passed while I been in here, and I kind of just started to tear up.'

The scene cut back to the psychic reading where a teary-eyed Bella was comforted by Locky and the fellow girls.

Bella then told cameras: 'I think something has happened, and I may need to go home. I need to call mum. I need to find out if my grandfather is okay.'

Following the phone call, Bella learnt that her grandfather was at the time alive and doing fine.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten.
