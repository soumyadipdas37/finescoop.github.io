A former army reservist took her own life after she suffered severe bouts of insomnia when she called off her wedding.

Leanne Carroll, 37, had been due to marry but she ended her engagement to her fiance six months before the ceremony for unknown reasons.

The PE teacher later began dating a new boyfriend but was so overwhelmed by anxiety and depression relating to sleep loss, she sent her father a text saying: 'Dad I don't feel in a good way please. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going mad.'

Despite being given help from her family and healthcare professionals, Miss Carroll was found dead at her home in Middleton, Greater Manchester by her family.

An inquest heard police investigating the tragedy on December 20 2018 found post-it notes around the flat expressing concerns including 'letting people down' and worries about 'being on her own.' Her new boyfriend was due to visit her that weekend.

Earlier the Rochdale hearing was told Miss Carroll was also a police officer in the RAF reserves had been described by her family as a 'loving and kind soul who brought love and light to those people she touched.'

Her father Bernard Carroll said in a statement: 'She joined the army reserves around the age of 33 and that's where she met her long term partner Jay. She then joined the RAF reserves as a police officer and was still a serving officer at the time of her death.

'She was due to marry in October 2018 but called the wedding off the previous April. The family worried initially but Leanne seemed to be fine.

'In September she threw herself into work with the RAF and spent weeks away from home. The family are convinced there may have been too many night shifts.

'She worked three weeks only having one night at work off and we didn't see much of her at this time and when we did she looked shattered.

'Her sister Gemma got a message from Leanne saying she wasn't feeling right. She said she had not been to work for a week and has not been sleeping properly for weeks. 

'She felt really really anxious and wasn't sleeping and had eczema on her eyes.

'Leanne had asked for counselling but every time she visited her GP she was prescribed a different medication.

'I had received a text message that said: 'Dad I don't feel in a good way please I think I need to go to the hospital, felt suicidal for weeks and worried I am going to do something to myself. 

'I don't know what to do I feel like I'm going mad.' It's the first time she's ever mentioned harming herself.

'She had a flashback about feeling that she didn't want to be here. I tried to contact Leanne when I received the text but she wouldn't answer. She did answer the phone to Gemma and was hysterically crying.

'She said she had driven her car on the M66 that afternoon with the view of crashing it but couldn't go through with it and got home. She told me she had not been sleeping for some time and everything was getting on top of her.

'She said she needed to go to North Manchester General Hospital and she seemed relieved that everything was going to get sorted. 

'She was told she had met the criteria of a voluntary section hospital ward but it was full of drunks and drug addicts and was not the best place for her.'

'Leanne seemed quite accepting of this but admitted she was scared of being on her own. The crisis team visited her and she was told somebody would be in contact regarding medication - however nobody rang.

'Leanne was going to her flat to sort things out before the weekend on December 20. That day Gemma was trying to contact her from 2pm and when she didn't get any response we went round.'

Gemma Carroll, told the inquest: 'Leanne was just so incredibly low and going through the motions. I know what it feels like to feel anxious and she just didn't have lots of energy and was very low.

'She was going out running and she could do that as she was in control and had gone to the gym a couple of times in that period. 

'She said her boyfriend Bill was coming to stay but I raised concerns that she needed to focus on getting herself better.'

Mental health nurse Gillian Fletcher who treated Miss Carroll told the hearing: 'In April 2018, Leanne and her partner had broken up and since then she had started to suffer with her sleep, loss of functioning and worries and over the last three weeks been off work.

'She was worried about not sleeping which has caused her more anxiety and distress. 

'She didn't wish to end her life - she wished to work towards recovery and formulated a safe plan using self-help techniques, had family support for her and she would utilise it. 

'She could identify relapse signs and when she was getting worse she knew how to get professional help and support. She felt able to do this with her father and sister understanding her condition.

'Leanne was a very pleasant lady and expressed a belief she would recover from her current period of low mood and anxiety. She was not suicidal and gave a reason like being with her family.

'She was not felt to be a risk to herself at this time and denied she was at any such risk and was positive about working towards recovery.'

A report investigating the way Miss Carroll's case was handled at the hospital found that she had been referred to the home treatment team but a lack of communication with family members was discovered and Greater Manchester mental health trust has been informed of the findings.

Recording a conclusion of suicide due to carbon monoxide poisoning Coroner Michael Salt, said: 'Leanne possibly didn't tell those seeking to help her about everything concerning her circumstances. 

'More information could have been obtained from the family in relation to what Leanne was thinking and actually doing.

'It may not have altered the course of treatment that was provided but, I take the families point on board in relation to that. 

'However I don't think I can stretch that to say it contributed to her death. My condolences to the family and no doubt friends in relation to their sad loss.'

A Just Giving page set up by her sister Gemma raised £915 for charity Mind and The RAF Benevolent fund.
