Nottingham Forest are expected to sign Benfica midfielder David Tavares on a loan deal which will include an option to buy the 21-year-old. 

Forest are in discussions over the sale of Matty Cash to Aston Villa for £12m plus bonuses.

Meanwhile, Aston Villa have made an improved £12million bid for Nottingham Forest right back Matty Cash.

Forest want around £15m for the 23-year old who has interest from Fulham, Sheffield United and Southampton. 

However, Villa, who had a £10m offer rejected, believe they can reach a compromise as talks continue.

Several Premier League clubs were in for the promising right-back in January but none could reach a deal with the Championship side.

Cash stayed and helped Forest in their bid to seal play-off football, which they agonisingly missed out on on the final day of the season on goal difference.

Cash has scored 16 goals for the club, including three this season, in 141 appearances since breaking into the senior side from the club's academy.
