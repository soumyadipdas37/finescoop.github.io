The moment a driver caused a three-car pileup after using the handbrake to stop on a highway to avoid crashing into a Portaloo truck has been caught on camera.

Terrifying footage shared by Dashcam Owners Australia showed the moment the accident unfolded on the Pacific Highway at the Oxenford exit near Queensland's Gold Coast on September 3 at about 3pm.

In the video, a grey Skoda Octavia could be seen trailing closely behind a larger vehicle carrying portable toilets on the three-lane motorway, which has a speed limit of 110km/h.

Smoke streamed from the Skoda's wheels as the driver appeared to engage the handbrake to avoid a collision, while swerving into oncoming traffic in the middle lane (pictured) 

The Portaloo truck slowed to move in to the congested left-hand lane to exit the highway, but the driver of the grey car was apparently startled.

Smoke streamed from the Skoda's wheels as the driver appeared to engage the handbrake to avoid a collision, while swerving into oncoming traffic in the middle lane.

The vehicle with the dashcam was travelling in the middle lane and crashed into the Skoda, sending both vehicles screeching into a white Toyota Hilux in the right-hand lane.

Pieces of plastic and debris from the smash were sent flying across windshields and onto the tarmac, as the three cars came to a grinding halt on the busy highway.

The footage sparked a heated debate in the comments section about how the Skoda driver used the brakes. 

'How did the driver lock up the back wheels like that? Seriously they couldn't have pulled the handbrake...could they?' asked one confused viewer.

'Only the back wheels locked up, so they definitely pulled the handbrake,' explained another.

'It really looks like the handbrake was used. You can see the car tip forwards before the brake lights even came on,' someone else wrote.
