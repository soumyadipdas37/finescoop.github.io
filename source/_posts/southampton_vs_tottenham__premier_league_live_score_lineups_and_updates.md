Southampton host Tottenham in Sunday afternoon Premier League action as both teams try and get their Premier League campaigns up and running.

Spurs were beaten by Everton on the opening weekend of the season but Jose Mourinho will be without new man Gareth Bale for the trip to St Mary's.

Southampton, meanwhile, lost at Crystal Palace last week and Ralph Hasenhuttl will be hoping star man Danny Ings can ignite his team to three precious points.

Sportsmail's KISHAN VAGHELA will provide live EPL coverage of Saints vs Spurs including score, lineups and build-up.
