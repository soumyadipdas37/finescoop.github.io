Married At First Sight's Seb Guilhaus is admired for his muscular physique. 

But the 31-year-old proved he is still in touch with his feminine side when he dressed in drag on his Instagram. 

On Wednesday, the former AFL player proved he has a great sense of humour as he donned a tight red bikini top along with a long blonde wig.  

Life's a drag! On Wednesday, Married At First Sight's Seb Guilhaus got in touch with his feminine side when he flaunted his bulging biceps and washboard abs in a blonde wig and a full face of slap 

Seb also showed off his pert derrière in a pair of black tights. 

The hunky reality star-turned-model chose a glossy make-up palette which included a matte lipstick, shimmering bronzer and mascara. 

In the footage, Seb is first seen shirtless, wearing just a pair of tight black jeans and a black belt, before he transforms into a full glamazon. 

Looking good! 'I finally understand the reels #hotgirlsummer #summerready,' Seb (pictured) captioned the short clip, tagging his girlfriend Elizabeth Sobinoff

'I finally understand the reels #hotgirlsummer #summerready,' Seb captioned the short clip, clearing proud of his shredded physique. 

He tagged his girlfriend Elizabeth Sobinoff in the post. 

Seb rose to fame alongside Elizabeth on the show's seventh season this year.

They reunited in June after being forced to spend months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Elizabeth spoke about living with her boyfriend of seven months while appearing on the podcast, Fashion Avenue.

'I mean, it's just normal to get frustrated with everyone,' she said, before adding that she was 'loving' being with Seb in Sydney.

She continued: 'I'm actually in such a great place in my life at the moment. He's just amazing! And it's that bonding.'

Lizzie explained she'd been staying with Seb at his home in Adelaide before the state borders closed and she was forced to return to NSW for work.

She said they ultimately ended up spending three months apart, but stayed connected through 'constant texting' while apart.
