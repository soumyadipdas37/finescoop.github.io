The film centres one woman (played by Tilda) and final phone conversation with her longtime lover, who has plans to marry another woman.

It comes after Tilda honoured the late actor Chadwick Boseman as she accepted an award at the festival by proclaiming 'Wakanda forever' on stage on Wednesday. 

The star was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award and proudly held her coveted trophy aloft after receiving the honour at the opening ceremony from Cate Blanchett, who heads this year's jury. 

At the end of her acceptance speech, Tilda gave a nod to her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe star Chadwick as she said: 'Viva Venezia. Cinema cinema cinema. Wakanda Forever. Nothing but love'. 

Tilda portrayed The Ancient One in Doctor Strange and Avengers: Endgame while Chadwick starred as T’Challa/Black Panther in the 2018 blockbuster Black Panther, which is set in the fictional country of Wakanda.

'The names on the list of those awarded this honor, meanwhile, they are the names of my masters. They’re the elders of my tribe. 

'The poets of the language I love above others. I sing their songs in the bath. I’m the punk kid film nut hitching a ride to the station to get to the foothills of the heights of their achievements.'

'To come to Venice, this year of all years, to celebrate immortal cinema and her defiant survival in the face of all the challenges that evolution might throw at her – as at us all – will be my sincere joy.'
