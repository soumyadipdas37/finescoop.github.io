Sales of electric bikes and e-scooters have more than tripled since last year as commuters have turned away from pubic transport for fear of catching coronavirus. 

E-bikes and scooters are becoming a popular trend, as a sustainable, healthy and cheap way of transport. 

And even though the coronavirus pandemic has cost major economical losses in most retailers in the country, a car and bicycle company has managed to triple their sales in the past few months.    

According to Halfords, people tend to avoid public transport and invest in a quirky scooter or bring back to life old bicycles. 

As a result, he retailer's sales of bikes and cycling equipment was 60% higher than last year while the demand for scooters rose to 230%. 

A large number of Brits choose a scooter as a quick way of getting to work everyday

  Halfords chief executive, Graham Stapleton said to the Guardian:'Nearly one in three of our adult bikes are electric against just 14% last year, so the proportion we are selling has almost doubled. I think that's important because with electric bikes, it is not just leisure, it is for essential use in terms of getting around and getting to work. On some of these bikes you can travel from 40 miles on one charge.' 

 More than 2.5m bikes were sold in the UK last year, with an average cost of £380, according to market research firm Mintel.  

 The new 'green' way of transport has become more popular among Brits especially after the end of the lockdown- countless e-scooters can be seen on UK roads every day, as the rental ones are now legal to ride.  

 

With cycling being the latest trend, more than 2.5m bikes were sold in the UK last year

 The government supports the trend of cycling as  local authorities are invited to bid for cash from a £250m emergency active travel fund. 

 Simultaneously with the rise of e-bikes sales, the boom in holidays in Britain meant the return of the cars, after four months, when in April, sales were down to  62%-travellers were quick to fit new tyres and spruce up their cars before long roadtrips. 

Halfords high demand in service and maintenance at its 367 garages proves that more and more people started using their car again.
