A British grandfather is in an induced coma in Tenerife after breaking his neck diving into a swimming pool.

Chris Watkins, 45, from Pontypool, Wales, was on holiday with a group of friends in Play de las America when the accident happened last Friday.

The groundsman's best friend told The Sun that he'd initially thought Mr Watkins was joking when he cried out, 'I can't feel anything.'

'He was on his side crying "I've broken my neck, I can't feel anything, help me" and I told him to stop being silly.' Christian Preece, 43, said.

The groundsman's best friend said that he'd initially thought Mr Watkins was joking when he cried out, 'I can't feel anything'

'I told him he'd only jarred it but he replied, "No, I'm serious," and my heart sank. He's a bit of a joker but I knew from his voice that he was telling the truth.

'He's been my best mate since we were four years old. To see him like this is like living a nightmare.'

His eldest daughter Kayleigh Watkins said her father was struggling with not being able to see his granddaughter, three year-old Gracie-Mae.

Ms Watkins, 23, told the Sun: 'I'm in total shock. I can't believe what's happened. When I saw him in his hospital bed I just started shaking and crying. I felt sick. To see him like that was awful.

His eldest daughter Kayleigh Watkins said her father was struggling with not being able to see his granddaughter, three year-old Gracie-Mae

'He was an absolutely brilliant dad who would do anything for us when we were growing up, and he's exactly the same with Gracie-Mae.

'He loves playing with her and not being able to do that will be so hard on him.'

His family have set up a GoFundMe page to pay for his medical fees and transport home.

The page was created by his sister Nadia Hopkins, who wrote: 'As you all probably know Christopher has had a life changing accident during a holiday in Tenerife.

'As a family we are all in a state of shock and disbelief and we are all completely devastated, being in a foreign country means that family members and friends cannot see him or support his Mother Father and two Daughters who are in Tenerife at the moment.

'Christopher is a fun loving vibrant person who everyone loves, he is full of energy and he is everyone's friend.

'We need your help to raise funds for medical costs and to get Christopher home as soon as possible any donations would be gratefully accepted and the family would like to say thank you in advance.'
