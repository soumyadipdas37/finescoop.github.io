Jessica Simpson cuddled up to her dashing husband Eric Johnson this Tuesday to celebrate his 41st birthday.

The singing sensation emphasized her sensational figure in skintight jeans while her dreamboat wrapped his toned arms around her.

'Oh how I love you!!! When I was in my mommy’s belly God formed me and placed you in my heart,' Jessica began her caption.

The 40-year-old took up with Eric in 2010 and married him in 2014, welcoming three children with him - Maxwell, eight, Ace, seven, and Birdie, one.

'It took me 29yrs to discover my soulmate and colliding with your heart was our spiritual destiny,' she wrote of the former NFL star.

'You are the human that all should aspire to be. A force of transformative inspiration to all that know and love you and are lucky enough to have you love them back.'

She added: 'I am so excited to see all that you have been working on so beautifully to be introduced into the world this year!'

Jessica soldiered ahead with a plug for her husband's new brand Legendary Disciplines, which made the hoodie she was wearing in the Instagram picture.

Eric joined Instagram just to start an account for the brand and Jessica swung by Insta Stories to welcome 'the most social guy I know' to the platform. 

'Everyone get ready to be enlightened by my legendary spiritual guru... @legendarydisciplines,' she wrote. 'Thank God ERIC JOHNSON was born this day 41yrs ago! Happy Birthday hubba hubba hubby of mine!!!'

Before Jessica married Eric, whose football position was tight end, she spent 2002 until 2006 married to her fellow singer Nick Lachey.

Nick has gone on to marry Vanessa Minnillo, whom he was infamously pap-snapped getting intimate with in a hot tub in Mexico while they were dating.

Jessica's younger sister and fellow pop act Ashlee Simpson is currently expecting her own third child, her second by her current husband Evan Ross.

Like his wife Evan comes from a showbiz family - his mother is legendary singer Diana Ross and his sister is actress Tracee Ellis Ross.
