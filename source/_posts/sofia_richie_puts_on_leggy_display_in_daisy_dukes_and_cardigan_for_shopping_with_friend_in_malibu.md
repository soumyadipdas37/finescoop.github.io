It came after sources confirmed that she and boyfriend of three years Scott Disick, 37, called it quits back in May.

They sparked rumors of reconciliation back in July, when they celebrated Independence Day together.

A source recently told People: 'It's always been difficult for them to balance their relationship with Scott's family life. His kids will always come first.'

Another insider said: 'Scott's focus is his health and the kids. Sofia wants to hang out with friends and enjoy the summer. Since they are no longer on the same page, they decided to just be apart. At least for now.'
