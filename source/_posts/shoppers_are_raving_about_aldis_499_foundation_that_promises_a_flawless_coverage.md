Customer Hete was so pleasantly surprised with the product she said it's the 'best low-cost foundation' she's ever tried

'I have to say it is one of the best or the best low-cost foundation I have ever tried. It was easy to apply, not greasy and I had pretty good coverage,' Hete said on Facebook.

'I use the $60+ high end type of foundations but this Aldi one is pretty good.

'I recommend it, my shade is medium beige the lighter version,' she said.

According to the product description, the foundation hides imperfections while keeping the skin hydrated and is best to apply with a brush or sponge. 

But there were mixed responses from other customers online who said the budget Aldi foundation is quite difficult to apply onto the skin. 

'I've tried it, found it really thick and hard to apply. My sister loves it though,' one shopper said.

'It turned a yellow undertone on my face and started to run after an hour - wasn't so impressed,' another said.

A third added: 'I find it a bit thick, but mix a little with my moisturiser and it's fine.'

Whereas others said they will purchase the beauty buy again as they were happy with the long-lasting coverage it provides. 

'I've been using it for years. Great coverage and lasts all day,' one woman said.

'I love it and the primer is amazing too,' a second said, another added: 'No complaints, all good!'

For the cheap price of $4.99, the foundation is worth trying and is available at Aldi store locations.
