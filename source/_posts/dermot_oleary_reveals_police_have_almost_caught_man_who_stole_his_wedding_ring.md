Dermot O'Leary has revealed police have almost caught the man who stole his wedding ring from a gym locker following a social media hunt for the culprit.

During a video link appearance on The One Show on Tuesday Dermot, 47, discussed tracking down the jewel thief and becoming a father for the first time.  

Dermot chatted to hosts Alex Jones and Ronan Keating about the new book he has written about a jewel thief after having his own ring stolen.

Detailing the experience, Dermot said: 'Yes. It wasn't that jewel thief, it was another one! Just around the corner from where you are actually. 

'I had my locker raided while I was at an exercise class and he took my whole bag which contained my wedding ring, which I had taken off because it can get snagged and so forth, and my crucifix and my watch. 

But Dermot revealed that due to the power of social media they were able to track down the man who had stolen his sentimental possessions. 



Appeal: Last month Dermot revealed his wedding ring was stolen from a gym and shared a police appeal on Twitter to find the thief

'Anyway, thanks to Instagram, we know who he is – I won't say his name cause shenanigans is hopefully happening so fingers crossed we catch him before he does it to anyone else'.

Last month Dermot revealed his wedding ring was stolen from a gym and shared a police appeal on Twitter to find the thief.

The ring was stolen along with a bag and a gold crucifix from a gym in central London. He tweeted: 'Sadly this was my wedding ring and bag that was stolen.'

He added that he is 'sure' he would not see the items again but would like to stop the man who allegedly stole his possessions from doing so again.

'Please have a good look at the picture and if you recognise him call 101 ref 6195/21aug,' he added.

In a separate Instagram post, O'Leary wrote: 'I know there are more important things happening in the world right now, but last week by bag (with my wedding ring in it) was stolen from a locked locker at Psycle on Mortimer St, London.

He added that the person who took the items 'stole something that would mean nothing to him but everything to me'.    

Elsewhere on the show, Dermot talked about his newborn son - Kasper - who he welcomed wit his wife Dee earlier this year.
