She cheered on her husband Tom Brady the week before as his team cruised to a win against the Carolina Panthers.

And Gisele Bündchen was back at it on Sunday as she shared another post to her Instagram stories cheering on Tom and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were once again victorious.

The 40-year-old supermodel looked playful in a red Bucs jersey as she rooted for the team while sporting a black arm sling.

Gisele seemed to be in a great mood and wasn't obviously in pain, though she hadn't mentioned why she wore the sling.

In addition to her jersey, the 5ft11in beauty showed off her long tanned legs in a pair of acid wash cutoff jeans. 

She held her pan of popcorn in the air, which she augmented with some Instagram popcorn designs. 

'Popcorn ready! Let's go Bucs!!!' she gushed in her caption. 

Tom was once again triumphant, as the Buccaneers defeated the Denver Broncos 28–10.

Team spirit: Last week, Gisele shared a boomerang to Instagram of herself and her children Benjamin, 10, and Vivian, seven, as they jumped up and down to cheer on Tom ahead of his game against the Panthers

In it together: 'Let's go Bucs, let's go papai!!!!' the former Victoria's Secret Angel captioned the boomerang, using the Portuguese version of daddy or papa

Last week, Gisele shared a boomerang to Instagram of herself and her children Benjamin, 10, and Vivian, seven, as they jumped up and down to cheer on Tom ahead of his game against the Panthers.

'Let's go Bucs, let's go papai!!!!' the former Victoria's Secret Angel captioned the boomerang, using the Portuguese version of daddy or papa.

The 5ft11in Brazilian beauty paired her black jersey with a slim pair of jeans and had her wavy brunette locks parted down the middle.

Benjamin looked like he was doing the twist just in front of her, while Vivian kept her jazz hands aloft while beaming ear-to-ear.

The Buccaneers went on to clobber the Panthers 31–17.

The win was the quarterback's first as a Buccaneer, after the New Orleans Saints defeated them 34–23 on September 13.

Tom made history at the game, becoming the oldest player in the NFL and the oldest person to ever score a touchdown.

Intimate details: Earlier this month, Tom sounded shocked after Dax Shepard asked on his Armchair Expert podcast if he ever had sex before games. 'Oh man, that's probably off the table,' he replied 

Earlier this month, Tom appeared on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast and shot down the suggestion that he and his wife celebrate in more a more intimate manner before his games.

The actor asked the 43-year-old quarterback his 'single Howard Stern-esque question' of the podcast: 'Do you make love to your wife on a game day?'

After letting out a laugh, Tom said, 'Oh man, that's probably off the table.'

'I wouldn't say it's probably never happened, but I don't think that would be the moment,' the six-time Super Bowl champ clarified.

Tom and Gisele have been together since 2006, and they married in 2009 in Santa Monica, California.

In addition to his two children with Gisele, the football star shares his 13-year-old son Jack with his former partner Bridget Moynahan.

Around the same time Tom was explaining his game day routines, his wife was getting personal about her struggles with anxiety.

Gisele shared a sweet photo of herself curled up with the family dog Lua while extolling the benefits of a 'reminder that the bad feelings will eventually go away...'

'Anxiety can feel all-consuming, and sometimes we need a supportive push to help break us out of our vicious cycle of worry,' she continued.

She revealed that she sought treatment in response to panic attacks, and specialists, along with her friends and family, helped her to move forward.
