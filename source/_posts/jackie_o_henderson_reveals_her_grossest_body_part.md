Jackie 'O' Henderson has spoken about what she perceives to be her most disgusting body part.

In a candid discussion on The Kyle & Jackie O Show on Friday, the 45-year-old media personality confessed she hates her fingernails.  

Jackie claimed she's able to tell what sort of fingernails a person has just by looking at their face.

She said it's a 'talent' she's developed because she's been 'obsessed' about fingernails for years.

Her co-host, Kyle Sandilands, admitted he was dubious about her self-confessed 'skill', but Jackie insisted she had a 100 per cent success rate.

Jackie then confessed that she has 's**t nails', and said her best friend, Sophie Monk, also has bad fingernails.

'I don't know if it's that much of a default, but I can never grow my nails. I have to keep them short for that reason,' she insisted, explaining that her nails have a tendency to 'turn up'

But she added that her Masked Singer co-star Dannii Minogue has 'amazing nails', describing them as 'naturally beautiful'. 

'Incredible nails. If I could choose anybody's nails, I would choose hers,' added Jackie of Dannii, 48.

Kyle, 49, described Jackie's nail obsession as 'strange', but she claimed it was justified, given how unhappy she is with her own fingernails.

'Well, when you've got nails that have short nail beds and they turn up instead of going over, you want what you can't have, so you become obsessed with looking at other people's,' she explained.

Jackie maintained that her nails 'curve up like a ski ramp', prompting Kyle to jokingly tell her that she would have been 'put down' if she were an animal.

'Oh, I don't know if it's that much of a default, but I can never grow my nails. I have to keep them short for that reason,' she insisted.
