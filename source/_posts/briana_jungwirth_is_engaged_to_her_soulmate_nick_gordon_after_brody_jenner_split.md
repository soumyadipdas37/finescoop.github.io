Briana Jungwirth is reportedly engaged to her on-off love Nick Gordon, after splitting from Brody Jenner. 

The stylist, who shares son Freddie, four, with Louis Tomlinson, is said to have been left over the moon after Nick proposed during a recent trip to Las Vegas. 

On Tuesday Briana, 28, shared a sweet snap of them in the city and alluded to their engagement as she wrote: '10 years of knowing you and I knew all along you were my soulmate. I love you!'

TMZ reports the lovebirds went ring shopping after the proposal.  

The news might come as a surprise to some, as Briana dated The Hills star Brody, 37, over summer, but the publication states they split a month ago. 

Brody and Briana were spotted together on numerous occasions with Brody taking her out for to dinner to meet his ex-wife Kaitlynn Carter, while she reportedly introduced him to her son.

However it is alleged they split because Brody thought the relationship was 'moving too fast'. 

Briana's 'fiancé' Nick has also littered his Instagram with a slew of loved-up snaps. 

On Tuesday, he posted a photo of himself and the blonde beauty holding hands with their backs to the camera, alongside the caption: 'Never lost when I'm with you.'

Brody, meanwhile, and his now ex-wife Kaitlynn married in an intimate ceremony in Bali in 2018, but parted ways in 2019 after five years together.

The couple's split was confirmed when Kaitlynn was pictured in an intimate clinch with singer Miley Cyrus, 27, while on holiday in Lake Como, Italy, last August.

The surprise relationship also marked the end of Miley's 20-month marriage to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, 30. 

The former couple are soon set to reunite on The Hills: New Beginnings, when production resumes later this summer.  

Brody and Kaitlynn have been spending some time together during quarantine to co-parent their dogs.
