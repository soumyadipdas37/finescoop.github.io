She was sent packing from The Bachelor on Wednesday. 

And now intruder Bec Cvilikas has spoken out about her time on the show and reflected on her short-lived romance with Locky Gilbert. 

Speaking to The Courier Mail, the 25-year-old said she never realised that Locky had such strong 'connections' with finalists Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska.   

Speaking out: The Bachelor's Bec Cvilikas (pictured) called Locky Gilbert a 'cheeky bugger' after being booted from the show - and said she never realised he had such strong 'connections' with Bella and Irena

She also called the 31-year-old former Australian Survivor star a 'cheeky bugger' after watching the show air on TV. 

'I was never aware of his connections with others,' Bec said, saying she wasn't 'surprised' that she got the flick. 

She added: 'I watched it back and thought, ''you cheeky bugger." You can see he has really strong feelings for the others.'

Despite also having a connection with Locky, she added that she had no intention to tell him she loved him like the others did, as her feelings weren't that strong for him.

The senior beauty consultant was sent packing on Wednesday's show alongside co-star Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29.

Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, are now Locky's top two finalists.

In a dramatic teaser for Thursday's finale, Locky breaks down in tears as he's forced to make the heartbreaking decision to let one go and pick his winner.

The decision is even more difficult given that the teaser shows him confidently telling both beauties that he's falling in love with them on their final dates together.

Locky tells the cameras: 'I thought I would come here and meet one person that I like and then end up together. But I found two!

'They are two of the most incredible women that I've ever met in my entire life.' 

A short scene in the teaser shows Locky telling a delighted Irena: 'I have fallen in love with you' - before he utters the same words of adoration to Bella on their own date.

Standing at his final rose ceremony, cameras pan around him as he breaks down into tears while asking himself: 'How am I meant to do it? You don't break up with someone you love!'

A primped and preened Irena makes her way to Locky while telling producers: 'Knowing that he's in love with me... I feel confident knowing that this is the beginning of our future together.' 

Elsewhere Bella adds that's Locky's declaration of love assured her.

'It's given me hope that everything will be alright. I mean, who tells someone they love them and then picks someone else?'

Osher dramatically declares the show will have 'an ending you won't believe.'

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
