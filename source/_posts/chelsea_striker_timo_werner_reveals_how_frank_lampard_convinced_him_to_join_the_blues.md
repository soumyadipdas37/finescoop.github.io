Timo Werner has revealed the lengths to which Frank Lampard went to persuade him to join Chelsea, explaining that the Blues boss sent him messages and video clips detailing why Stamford Bridge was his perfect destination.

The 24-year-old forward, who made a brilliant introduction to Premier League football with a starring role in Chelsea’s win over Brighton on Monday, spoke to a number of top clubs including Liverpool before leaving RB Leipzig in a £53million move earlier this summer.

Werner has said Lampard was one of the main reasons he chose Chelsea and now he has opened up on how the manager turned his head.

After a summer arrival, Timo Werner made his Chelsea debut at Brighton on Monday night

'It was a strange time, we couldn't meet each other and we met each other here for the first time because of the virus,' he said.

'But he called me a lot, we had a lot of conversations, he texted me a lot and he sent me some videos where he could show me what style of football he wants to play. So for me those were important things to know about moving to a new club.'

'Because I loved to play for Leipzig and everything was well for me there. So it was really important for me to come to a team with a vision that fits my style of football.

'I think the whole Premier League fits very well to my style of football, because it's so fast, and fast players have really good space to go and play well. And it was really important that he gave me the feeling that the system he wants to play will fit me very well.'

Off the pitch, Werner is settling well into life in England, too. He has already sourced a car, a London flat and has had help from club officials with initial teething problems, such as when he struggles to understand bills sent to his house.

Lampard’s personality – and his focus on players’ human side – was another decisive factor in Werner’s decision to move to Stamford Bridge.

'The conversation with him was also really important, he's a very nice and calm guy, who makes it clear what he wants and what his football style is. And he makes it clear that you're not only a player but also a person,' Werner said.

'Not like a friend because he's the manager and you have to have a respectful relationship. But also he sees you the other way, as a person, not just as a footballer, so that was really impressive for me and that's one of the reasons why I came here.'

Werner now hopes to hit the ground running as Lampard's main striker at Stamford Bridge

Werner hit the ground running on his debut at the AMEX this week, posing a threat before and after he won a first-half penalty which put Lampard's side on course for three points.

‘When I decided to leave Leipzig I talked to different clubs,' he said. 'Of course there are some other clubs also that have a great team and maybe I can fit in well to other teams but in the end I decided on Chelsea because for me it was the best decision I can take, not only because of the style of football but also because of what they showed me.

'I think it was a hard decision in the end, but I'm very, very excited and proud and very happy that I decided like this…it feels right, it feels very good.’
