Arabella Del Busso's own mother Isobel has slammed Channel Seven for casting the controversial ex-WAG in new reality show SAS Australia.

In comments made to The Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday, Isobel Preusker said it should be 'criminal' to pay someone on TV when they have hurt 'so many people'.  

'I am disgusted they (Seven) would put my daughter on air as a celebrity,' she said. 

Not holding back! Arabella Del Busso's mother Isobel Preusker (pictured) SLAMMED 'disgusting' Seven for giving the controversial ex-WAG fame and money by casting her on SAS Australia, in comments made to The Sydney Morning Herald on Sunday 

'It's bad enough she has hurt Josh Reynolds – now they are rubbing his face in it by paying her to be on TV,' Isobel continued.

'He doesn't deserve this; not from her. He has been through a lot and had his reputation questioned or ruined by her. It's disgusting. It really should be criminal.'

Fans threatened to boycott SAS Australia if she appears, after Arabella, 30, was seen standing next to Schapelle Corby during a scene in the show's latest trailer.

Outrage: 'He doesn't deserve this; not from her. He has been through a lot and had his reputation questioned or ruined by her. It's disgusting. It really should be criminal,' Isobel continued to say of her daughter's casting  

The influencer appeared very briefly, wearing her hair in long, dark braids that were pulled off her face into a ponytail. 

She first made headlines when she went to the police with a video of her ex-partner Josh Reynolds yelling at her.

The charges against the 31-year-old Wests Tigers player were dropped in February, but fans aren't happy that Arabella has now landed a role on a major reality show.

Angry rugby league fans vented their frustration on Twitter after it was revealed that Arabella would be joining the cast. 

'I'll never watch Channel Seven putting a loser like that on. Shows how much credibility they have,' one critic tweeted.

'I, for one, will not be tuning in... Absolutely disgusted in your efforts for ratings,' another added.

Arabella last appeared on television in May, when she addressed her bitter split with Josh on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.   

During the interview, Arabella tearfully denied faking pregnancies and miscarriages during her tumultuous relationship with the footy star. 

However, she did admit to passing off another woman's ultrasound scan as her own in order to 'spite' her then-boyfriend.

Filming for SAS Australia begun earlier this year in Queenstown, New Zealand.

But production was later relocated to the NSW Snowy Mountains due to travel restrictions being enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Arabella joins the growing list of celebrities set to appear on the show, including Schapelle Corby and publicist Roxy Jacenko.
