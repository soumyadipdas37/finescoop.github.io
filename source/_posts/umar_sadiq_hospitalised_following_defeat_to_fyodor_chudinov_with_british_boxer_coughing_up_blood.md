Sadiq's defeat came just 40 seconds into round 12 of the WBA gold belt bout, but it represented just his second loss in a 12-fight career to date.

The Ilford boxer - who was born in Nigeria - has six knockouts among his 10 professional wins, and has been preparing for a British title shot against Lerrone Richards.

However, after discovering his fight with Richards would not take place in September, Sadiq decided to fight Chudinov.

The British boxer was only informed of the fight three-and-a-half weeks ago, and after undergoing a coronavirus test and finalising an agreement last week he flew out to Russia. 

However, he came up short against former WBA world champion Chudinov, who is now on a nine-fight winning streak.

The Russian is pushing for a mandatory title challenge against current WBA champion Callum Smith, with his win on Friday making him the form runner to face the Brit next.
