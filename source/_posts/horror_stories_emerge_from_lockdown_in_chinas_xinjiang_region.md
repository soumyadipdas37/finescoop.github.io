Horror stories have emerged from China's Xinjiang region of people who were detained and forced to drink 'traditional Chinese medicine' at the height of lockdown.

The government in the northwest region has resorted to draconian measures to combat the coronavirus, with authorities locking residents inside their homes and enforcing longer quarantines for those who don't comply. 

Some citizens have also reported being coerced into taking 'traditional Chinese medicine', in what experts call a breach of medical ethics.  

One Uighur woman said she was crammed into a cell with dozens of other women in a detention centre at the height of the outbreak.

She claims guards forced her to drink a medicine which made her feel weak and nauseous. She and others also reportedly had to strip naked once per week and cover their faces as they were hosed down with disinfectant.

'It was scalding,' the woman, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution, said. 'My hands were ruined, my skin was peeling.'

The latest lockdown comes amid 826 new cases of Covid-19 which have been reported in Xinjiang since July. 

Although this is China's largest caseload since the initial outbreak, the strict measures are particularly striking considering there hasn't been a single new case in over a week.   

Harsh lockdowns have been imposed elsewhere in China, most notably in Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected. 

But though Wuhan grappled with over 50,000 cases and Hubei with 68,000 in all - far more than Xinjiang - residents were not forced to take traditional medicine and were generally allowed outdoors.    

The response to an outbreak of more than 300 cases in Beijing in June was even milder still, with a few select neighborhoods locked down for just a few weeks. 

In contrast, more than half of Xinjiang's 25 million people are under a lockdown that extends hundreds of miles from the center of the outbreak in the capital, Urumqi, according to Government notices and state media reports.  

Xinjiang's lockdown is overseen by a vast surveillance apparatus which appears to have turned the region into a digital police state. 

Over the past three years, authorities have swept a million or more Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities into various forms of detention, including extrajudicial internment camps, under a widespread security crackdown.

The Uighur woman was released and locked inside her home after a month in detention, despite regular tests showing she is free of Covid-19.

She claims community workers force her to drink traditional medicine in unmarked, white bottles once per day - saying she will be detained if she refuses to drink.

Authorities say the measures are taken for the well-being of residents, though they haven't commented on why they are harsher than those taken elsewhere.   

The Chinese government has struggled for decades to control Xinjiang, at times clashing violently with many of the region's native Uighurs, who resent Beijing's heavy-handed rule.    

'The Xinjiang Autonomous Region upheld the principle of people and life first... and guaranteed the safety and health of local people of all ethnic groups,' Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday.

Authorities can carry out the harsh measures, experts say, because of its lavishly funded security apparatus, which by some estimates deploys the most police per capita of anywhere on the planet.

'Xinjiang is a police state, so it's basically martial law,' says Darren Byler, a researcher on the Uighurs at the University of Colorado. 

'They think Uighurs can´t really police themselves, they have to be forced to comply in order for a quarantine to be effective.'

Earlier this month, thousands of Xinjiang residents took to social media to complain about what they called excessive measures against the virus. 

One Han Chinese woman posted photographs of herself drinking 'traditional Chinese medicine' in front of a medical worker in full protective gear.

'Why are you forcing us to drink medicine when we´re not sick!' she wrote in a post which was quickly deleted. 

'Who will take responsibility if there´s problems after drinking so much medicine? Why don´t we even have the right to protect our own health?'

The government claims that the participation rate in traditional Chinese medicine treatment in the region has 'reached 100 per cent', according to a state media report. Pictured: Beijing

A few days later she added: 'I've lost all hope. I cry when I think about it.'

Authorities eased some restrictions last week following harsh criticism, now allowing some residents to walk within their compounds. Others have been permitted to leave the region after a bureaucratic approval process.

Another Han businessman said he was placed in quarantine in July and has not been let outside despite testing negative for Covid-19 five times.

He said his posts have been deleted every time he has complained about his predicament online.  

'The most terrible thing is silence,' he wrote in mid-August. 'After a long silence, you will fall into the abyss of hopelessness.'

'I've been in this room for so long, I don't remember how long. I just want to forget,' he wrote again, days later. 'I'm writing out my feelings to reassure myself I still exist. I fear I'll be forgotten by the world.'

He is also being forced to take the traditional medicine from an unmarked white bottle. 

The man has also been asked to take Lianhua Qingwen, a herbal remedy seized regularly by US Customs and Border patrol for violating FDA laws by falsely claiming to be effective against Covid-19.

The Chinese government has pushed traditional medicine on its population since the start of the outbreak late last year. The remedies are touted by President Xi Jinping, who has advocated a revival of traditional Chinese culture. 

Although some state-backed doctors say they have conducted trials showing the medicine works against the virus, no rigorous clinical data supporting that claim has been published in scientific journals.   

'None of these medicines have been scientifically proven to be effective and safe,' said Fang Shimin, a former biochemist and writer known for his investigations of scientific fraud in China. 'It's unethical to force people, sick or healthy, to take unproven medicines.'

Thousands flooded pharmacies in Hubei searching for traditional remedies when the virus began spreading last year. Packs of pills were tucked into care packages and sent to Chinese workers and students overseas.    

But the new measures in Xinjiang forcing some residents to take the medicine is unprecedented, experts say.  

The government claims that the participation rate in traditional Chinese medicine treatment in the region has 'reached 100 per cent', according to a state media report. 

When asked about resident complaints that they were being forced to take Chinese medicine, one local official said it was being done 'according to expert opinion.'

'We're helping resolve the problems of ordinary people,' said Liu Haijiang, the head of Dabancheng district in Urumqi, 'like getting their children to school, delivering them medicine or getting them a doctor.'

In March, the World Health Organization removed guidance on its website saying that herbal remedies were not effective against the virus and could be harmful, saying it was 'too broad'. 

Later, in May, Beijing city government announced a draft law that would criminalise speech 'defaming or slandering' traditional Chinese medicine. 

Now, the government is pushing traditional Chinese remedies as a treatment for Covid-19 overseas, sending pills and specialists to countries such as Iran, Italy, and the Philippines.
