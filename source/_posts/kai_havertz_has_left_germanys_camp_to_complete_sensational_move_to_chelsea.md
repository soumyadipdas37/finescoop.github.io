Kai Havertz has left the Germany team's training camp to wrap up his £90million move to Chelsea, according to reports.

The German playmaker has been linked with Frank Lampard's men for months and the deal is expected to be confirmed imminently. Havertz was an unused substitute in his country's 1-1 draw with Spain on Thursday night as Chelsea's Timo Werner grabbed the headlines by scoring the opener.

Havertz looks set to line up alongside him next season with the Athletic reporting that he has now departed Joachim Low's squad in order to push the move through.
