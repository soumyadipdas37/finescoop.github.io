Bachelorette couple Angie Kent and Carlin Sterritt confirmed their split in July after being plagued by breakup rumours for weeks.

And on Monday, Carlin appeared to be keeping the faith as he showed off two new biblical tattoos on his Instagram Stories.

The 31-year-old had a quill with a psalm verse etched onto one forearm, as well as a religious take on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man on one bicep.

Keeping the faith! Bachelorette winner Carlin Sterritt (pictured), 31, got two biblical tattoos on Monday, after his split from Angie Kent in July 

'If I rise on the wings on the dawn,' the verse surrounding the quill read.

Angie, 30, revealed on radio in September that she and Carlin, who met on the 2019 season of The Bachelorette, called it quits because their 'values didn't align'. 

'Chemistry doesn't always equal compatibly,' she said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show.

Religious: On Instagram Stories, the fitness strainer showed off a quill with a psalm verse on one forearm. The verse read: 'If I rise on the wings of the dawn' 

'Our values were different. I'm a little more spiritual, a little bit more carefree and wild. He's a Christian boy... we're just different.'  

The blonde beauty also told House Of Wellness that she has been seeking professional help with the heartbreaking split, dealing with feelings as they arise.

'I am navigating it all and dealing with the feelings and thoughts as they arise... and have an amazing therapist who is helping,' she told the publication.

Intricate: Carlin also had a religious take on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man etched on one bicep. It represents what is thought to be the divine connection between the human form and the universe  

Not compatible: Angie revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show in September that she and Carlin called it quits because their 'values didn't align' 

Meanwhile, Carlin told Instagram fans in July that their breakup had 'taken a toll' on him, while discussing his battle with anxiety.

Thanking them for their support, the fitness trainer said: 'Everybody has actually been really kind. I had so much fear and anxiety about coming out about our breakup publicly.  

'It was actually quite debilitating each day when I was holding on to that truth. Yes we have come up with the decision [to split] recently, but I've just been so scared.' 

Differences: 'Our values were different. I'm a little more spiritual, a little bit more carefree and wild. He's a Christian boy... we're just different,' the 30-year-old said
