Undefeated UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya has revealed the reason why he famously writes his opponent's name in the air seconds before a fight.

The 31-year-old, who was born in Nigeria and bases himself in New Zealand, is a huge fan of Japanese animation, in particular the manga series Death Note.

The series is a popular fantasy show where a student discovers a notebook allowing the holder to kill anyone by writing the person's name on the page.

Adesanya clearly was taken in by the work of Japanese author Tsugumi Ohba.

He famously adopted the persona of  'Anime' in his UFC 243 battle against Australian Robert Whittaker last October.

The former professional boxer and kickboxer comfortably won that fight via knockout in the second round to become the undisputed UFC middleweight champion.

'You see me try something I've seen in cartoons or video games,' Adesanya told ESPN when quizzed on his unique pre-fight routine.

'I'll pull it out in the Octagon (this weekend) because, I don't know, I can do it. 'I blur the lines between reality and fantasy.' 

Adesanya, who is yet to taste defeat in 19 fights, is planning to put on another clinic this weekend (Sunday, September 27) when he takes on unbeaten Brazilian Paulo Costa in the United Arab Emirates in UFC 253.
