Grisly video captured the moment an unknown gunman shot dead a 17-year-old boy who attempted to flee during a gun battle. 

The New York Police Department on Sunday released surveillance footage of the shooting that killed Kether Werts on Thursday.  

The incident happened just before 5pm outside 1705 Hoe Avenue in the Crotona neighborhood of the Bronx.

Footage shows two men wearing black hoodies and white face masks engaging with a group of teenagers across the street. 

It's unclear what is said, but one of the teenagers cross the street to approach the men.

Then, the group of teenagers begin to desperately flee the area at the apparent start of gunfire. 

A few of the boys manage to escape, but Werts appears to get caught in between two vehicles as one gunman follows him.  The teenager trips to the ground and attempts to crawl away.
