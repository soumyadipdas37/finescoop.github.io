Southampton are among the clubs interested in Ruben Loftus-Cheek with interest mounting in the midfielder after he was left out of Chelsea's last two games.

England midfielder Loftus-Cheek started first game of the season at Brighton but has failed to make Frank Lampard's squad for subsequent matches against Liverpool and Barnsley.

Lampard insisted 'nothing is concrete so don't read too much into those selections at the minute,' when asked about the omissions of Loftus-Cheek and defender Antonio Rudiger, following Chelsea's 6-0 Carabao Cup win over Barnsley on Wednesday.

But the potential availability of Loftus-Cheek on loan has alerted a number of Chelsea's Premier League rivals plus clubs abroad.

Aston Villa, West Ham and West Brom are among those keen. Southampton also have Loftus-Cheek on their list of targets though his wages represent a stumbling block and any deal would require Chelsea to subsidise part of his salary.

Southampton are in the market for a midfielder after the departures of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Harrison Reed and Mario Lemina left Ralph Hasenhuttl with four central midfielders. They are also monitoring Everton's Tom Davies.

Aston Villa, West Ham and West Brom are also interested with the midfielder's future in doubt

Academy product Loftus-Cheek was finding his feet in Chelsea's first team and enjoyed a successful season when he suffered a serious Achilles injury in May 2019.

He was on the verge of a return just before this year's coronavirus shutdown and eventually made his comeback in Chelsea's first Project Restart game last season against Aston Villa in June.

But Loftus-Cheek, who remains in the dark about his recent absences, has struggled for the regular game time in his preferred central midfield role that he needs to recapture his form.

Antonio Rudiger was also left out but Frank Lampard insisted that nothing was concrete

Only one of his remaining eight appearances at the end of last season was from the start, against Norwich.

Lampard added on Rudiger and Loftus-Cheek: 'The situation with both is that they weren't in the squad. That is just a choice at the moment.

'I keep getting asked about the size of the squad. There might be movement. It will have to be things which are right for the club and individuals and me and in terms of what happens in the next couple of weeks.'
