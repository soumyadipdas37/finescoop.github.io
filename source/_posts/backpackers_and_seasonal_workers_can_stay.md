Unemployed Australians are about to come under increasing 'heat and pressure' to take farm jobs instead of relying on welfare payments as a reduced supply of workers pushes up the prices of fruit and vegetables.

The federal government is set to announce a range of measures in next week's budget to get the huge numbers of people thrown out of work by coronavirus lockdowns to take up employment in rural and regional areas.

Among the measures, workers on JobSeeker will to earn $300 per fortnight before it affects their payment levels.

That will push up the amount of money a JobSeeker recipient can receive to $1,160 a fortnight, or $30,000 per year.

The government is also considering ways to push the unemployed to take the jobs.

'We need some more teeth,' federal Liberal MP John Alexander told a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday.

'While we can't probably go to conscription, can we apply a little more heat and pressure and do it urgently? Because the crops won't wait.'

Efforts to get workers to accept regional jobs have largely failed, with primary sector employees able to offer low wages to foreign backpackers and imported temporary workers.

'The question should be asked, "if not, why not?" If somebody is saying "Oh no, I don't want to do that" because they're just happy sitting on the couch and taking the dole,' Mr Alexander said.

'What more pressure could be applied to somebody who's a little bit marginal?

'It needs to be done as if we're in a war situation. It needs to be mobilised very quickly.'

As well as trying to entice Australians into taking the jobs, the government is also looking to allow backpackers and seasonal workers to extend their visas to pick fruit amid critical labour shortages.

The primary industry sector has been pushing for such measures because international and state border closures have restricted availability of workers, with an estimated shortfall of about 26,000 harvesters.

They say the cost of wasted produce, and higher wages, will drive up the cost of fresh produce by Christmas and put financial strain on families struggling amid the COVID-19 economic downturn. 

The age limit for working holidaymakers will be temporarily lifted, allowing people above the age of 31 to work as fruit pickers.

Programs aimed at bringing in Pacific and Timorese workers to fill rural and regional job shortages will also reopen.

Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has already announced a range of changes aimed at plugging the gaps.

'Farmers don't have the luxury of sitting around waiting for workers to turn up and we don't want fruit rotting on the vine or crops left in the field,' he said on Wednesday.

He also explained the federal government will work closely with farmers on additional measures ahead of next week's federal budget. 

According to a report by consultancy firm Ernst & Young, the demand for pickers will peak in March next year.

'Current scenario projections indicate that the casual labour gap will increase from November 20 and reach a peak in March 21 likely to represent a gap ranging between ­20,000 and 26,000 roles,' the analysis read, according to The Australian.

'This would represent a 36 to 59 per cent labour supply shortage over Nov 20 to June 21.'

Areas that would suffer the most are Tasmania and Victoria due to their strict border closures and the intensive effort it takes to harvest grapes and berries.

Cairns and Wide Bay in Queensland, north-west Victoria, Grafton and Murray in NSW, and the south-east coast of the nation would also be hit hard by the workforce shortages. 

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told the ABC on Wednesday that cherry farmers in Young, in the south west New South Wales, are short 3,500 pickers.

'That's just one area,' he said.

'What we want to make sure [farmers] can get that fruit picked so that it doesn't rot on the trees.'

He urged unemployed Australians consider fruit harvesting to fill the workforce gaps.

'We're backing regional Australia. I'm very confident about the future of regional Australia and very confident about the harvest that we are going to have this summer, but we need workers. We need those people to come to regional Australia.'
