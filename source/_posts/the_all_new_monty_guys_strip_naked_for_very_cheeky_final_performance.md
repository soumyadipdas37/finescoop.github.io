The boys certainly pulled it out of the bag when it counted on Sunday's episode of The All New Monty: Guys & Gals.

After a disastrously out of sync dress rehearsal, the celebrity line-up showed off their fancy footwork while stripping naked in a bid to raise awareness for prostate and testicular cancer during their final performance on the Channel Seven charity special. 

With the boys' clothes dropping by the second, audience members could not contain themselves as they screamed, danced and clapped in support from their seats.

Lights, camera, action! The boys certainly pulled it out of the bag when it counted on Sunday's episode of The All New Monty: Guys and Gals

Tom Derickx, Adam Dovile, Orpheus Pledger, Wayne Carey, Samuel Johnson, Michael Slater, Shannan Ponton and Paul Fenech practised rigorously throughout the episode to nail their routine.

And choreographer Todd McKenney certainly had his work cut out for him as he struggled to get the boys to flawlessly execute their dance moves in rehearsals.

Attempting to ease their nerves, Todd took the performers to the salon to get a wax and a spray-tan.

Once primped and preened, it was time for the boys to hit the stage and perform for a packed out theatre.

Despite the less than promising rehearsal, the final performance went without a hitch with everyone hitting their marks at the perfect time.

While many sported evident nerves about stripping off earlier in the episode, they oozed confidence as a bevvy of glamorous back-up dancers ripped their white shirts from their bronzed torsos.

Not done there with the racy displays, the boys cheekily stripped off their trousers to reveal their silver G-Strings.

With the screams in the audience getting louder, the boys let the audience members in for one final treat as they ripped off their barely there underwear.

The boys clearly had adrenaline rushing through their veins as they rushed off stage in excitement.

Backstage, Adam gushed: 'My heart was beating out of my chest! It gave me goosebumps, that was amazing!'

Choreographer Todd told the men: 'Talk about pulling it out of the bag when it counted. Like, that was seriously the best you've done it!'

Earlier in the episode, the girls came together for the first time to discuss their nerves about stripping naked and discuss their personal experiences with breast cancer.

The All New Monty: Guys and Gals continues Sunday at 7pm on Channel Seven.
