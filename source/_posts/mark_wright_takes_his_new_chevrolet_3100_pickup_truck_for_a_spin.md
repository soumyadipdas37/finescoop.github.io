Mark opted for a laid-back look in a smart black t-shirt paired with a long chain necklace for the outing in the classic car which can fetch around £40,700 for a 1958 model.

Speaking on his Instagram Stories, Mark said: 'Just finished work - starving, didn't want to get dressed up come to this new takeaway at Sheesh - here it comes. 

'My grub over the counter it's like being in America. Little takeaway Sheesh but you can eat it here, out here, lovely.'

It comes after Mark has reportedly landed role fronting the pilot for a new show in the United States after winning over producers with his 'cheeky persona'. 

According to The Sun the pilot was filmed last month and Mark is already hoping that it could mark a return to America after previously living there for two years.

An insider revealed: 'He was chosen to front a new pilot by a TV ­network in the US who are keen to see if they can get him back on screen.

'Obviously the dream would be to become as big as his pal James Corden, who landed his own chat show out there on CBS.' 

While Mark was away filming for Extra, Michelle, 33, was based in South Africa filming for BBC1 drama Our Girl, however they are now both based in Essex.  

Suggesting that Michelle would join Mark on his latest project, a source revealed: 'If the right chance did come up they'd see if they could make it work but they would never want to live apart for long ­periods again.'
