Bournemouth striker Josh King has emerged as a target for Tottenham as Jose Mourinho steps up his search for a back-up to Harry Kane, according to reports.

With time running out before the transfer window closes, Spurs are intensifying their efforts to bring in another forward.

And it is Norwegian international King who could be the man to make the move to north London, claim The Telegraph.

Boss Jose Mourinho is desperately seeking added cover in his forward department

Mourinho has reportedly become increasingly frustrated with Spurs' failure to so far land that cover for the talismanic Kane.

The England captain has started in five of Tottenham's six games so far this season, including their Europa League trips to Bulgaria and North Macedonia. 

King was part of the Bournemouth side which was relegated to the Championship last season, but he has proven himself a reliable goalscorer in the Premier League.

He found the back of the net 48 times in the English top-flight during the Cherries' five years in the division.

New boss Jason Tindall has admitted the south-coast club won't stand in the forward's way if the right offer should come in.

Although deadline day is just a week away on October 5, Premier League sides are still able to buy from the EFL for a further 11 days, increasing Spurs' chances of snaring King.

Finding back-up to Kane has proven problematic for Spurs in recent years, and the hope remains that they can find a successful solution.

Vincent Janssen proved disastrous when he arrived for £17m in 2016, scoring just two Premier League goals.

Fernando Llorente was a more able deputy, but still only scored twice in the Premier League before heading to Napoli in Serie A.
