He revealed earlier this summer that he spent a week in the hospital battling COVID-19 back in April.

But Mel Gibson looked healthy and rugged on Saturday as he ventured out into Malibu with his much-younger girlfriend Rosalind Ross, 30, and their young son Lars Gibson, three.

The 64-year-old Lethal Weapon star was spotted loading up his Audi SUV after a trip to Whole Foods to stock up on groceries.

Gibson was dressed in an independence blue polo shirt with the collar popped for a youthful look.

He also wore a pair of navy shorts with black sneakers and black socks, and he covered his head with a gray baseball cap. 

Rosalind was dressed more casually in a black hoodie and loose-fitting black pants with matching sandals.

She had a white mask down around her neck, while her filmmaker husband brought along a red bandana to ward off the novel coronavirus.

The two also brought along their son Lars, who had on a black T-shirt and teal shorts while rocking long blonde hair.

Gibson was first revealed to be in a relationship with Ross, a writer and former champion equestrian, in 2014, and he welcomed his ninth child with her in 2016.

The Chicken Run star was previously in a relationship with the Russian musician Oksana Grigorieva from 2009–2010, with whom he shares his 10-year-old daughter Lucia.

Prior to that, he spent more than three decades married to his wife Robyn Moore, whom he wed in 1980 and divorced in 2011.

Earlier this week, it was reported that Saban films had acquired the rights to Gibson's next film, the dark comedy Fatman, in which a disgruntled child hires a hitman (Walton Goggins) to assassinate Santa Claus (Gibson) after he finds a lump of coal in his stocking.

Gibson has recently found more acting work with the well-reviewed crime thriller Dragged Across Concrete and a string of low-budget action films, and he returned to directing with 2016's inspiring war film Hacksaw Ridge, about a pacifist combat medic.

Gibson was shut out of Hollywood for years following a 2006 DUI arrest, in which he was found speeding with an open alcohol container in his vehicle.

The arrest report described an anti-Semitic tirade from the conservative Catholic in which he said to the arresting officer, 'F**king Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?'

Over the summer, a 2010 G! interview with Winona Ryder resurfaced in which the Age Of Innocence actress claimed Gibson called her an 'oven-dodger,' referencing her Jewish ancestry and the Holocaust.

'I was at one of those big Hollywood parties. And he was really drunk,' Ryder said at the time.

'I was with my friend, who's gay. [Gibson] made a really horrible gay joke. And somehow it came up that I was Jewish. He said something about "oven dodgers," but I didn't get it. I'd never heard that before.'

Ryder renewed the accusation in June during an interview with The Sunday Times.
