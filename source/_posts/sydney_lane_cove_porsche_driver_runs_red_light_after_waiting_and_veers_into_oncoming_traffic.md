The shocking moment a Porsche Cayenne drives past a red light into oncoming traffic before being T-boned by another car has been captured on video. 

The Porsche driver waited at the light for 10 seconds before attempting to cross a main road in Lane Cove in Sydney's Lower North Shore on at 7:17pm last Friday. 

Another driver behind the Porsche witnessed the luxury car wait, drive into traffic and cause the crash while recording the whole incident on their dash camera.

Footage of the crash was then posted to the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page on Wednesday. 

'You know it's a red light. You stopped for 10 seconds and decided to move on under a red. I am confused,' the witness driver said in the caption. 

Facebook users speculated that the Porsche driver intentionally caused the crash for an insurance scam.

'Porsche driver probably trying to write off his car to get a pay out for these covid 19 times,' one person wrote. 

'Doesn't move when it is clear and only drives through intersection when cars are coming. So I'm thinking insurance job.'  

'Looks to be a staged accident for a fraudulent insurance claim,' another user agreed.'

In the footage, the car waited at least 10 seconds at the light before deciding to pull out into oncoming traffic.   

Another car driving at full speed in the right lane was unable to slow down in time and hit the driver's door of the Porsche. 

The hood of the oncoming car was smashed and smoke could be seen coming from both vehicles involved after the crash. 

Meanwhile, other cars slowed down and overtook the crash in the left lane. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Police for comment
