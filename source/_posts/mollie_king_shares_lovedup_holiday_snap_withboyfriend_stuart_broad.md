She captioned the shot: 'We contemplated double denim a la Britney and Justin, but settled on the white ❤️ #matchymatchy'.

On her stories the Radio One presenter teased a hint of her toned bikini body as she slipped into a triangle two-piece to lounge around the pool.

The blonde beauty teamed the swimwear with a straw fedora hat and told her followers she was going to order some cocktails after playing catch with her beau.

Stuart also took to Instagram to post a selfie of him and Mollie snuggled up on the plane, wearing face masks.  

It comes after the cricketer discussed Mollie in a recent interview with Mail On Sunday. 

He said: 'Being restricted to my home in Nottingham for the longest stretch I can remember in my career has meant I have gone from international cricket to playing against my girlfriend Mollie, who has become quite good at batting, posting her efforts on Instagram.

Having fun: Stuart got some cricket practice in the pool

'She has been very enthusiastic. Some might say a bit too enthusiastic on occasion — like when she bowled the ball over the net, which is between 10-12 feet high, and cleared the hedge, too. Next-door didn't give it back, either!'

He continued: 'When we first met, Mollie didn't know anything about cricket. But she has tried hard to pick things up.

'For example, during one of the first Test matches I played when we were together, I received a text message from her saying: "Well done today. I thought X was the key wicket, and a real breakthrough for the team."  

'She had copied it off the BBC Sport website's live blog!' 

Mollie previously dated model David Gandy between April 2011 and February 2012, with the pair rekindling their romance in 2014. They finally split two years later.
