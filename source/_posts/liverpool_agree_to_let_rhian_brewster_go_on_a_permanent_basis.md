Sheffield United and Crystal Palace are preparing to step up their interest in Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster.

Brewster has held talks with Jurgen Klopp over his future this week and the champions will allow the 20-year-old to leave permanently if a suitable move can be found.

Liverpool value Brewster at around £20m and any deal for striker is set to include a buy-back clause.

Sheffield United and Palace are the frontrunners in the race for Brewster, an England under-17 World Cup and golden boot winner, who impressed on loan at Swansea last season and is keen to continue his development with regular football that Liverpool believe he is not quite ready for at Anfield.

Brewster scored 11 goals in 22 games for the Welsh club to help them reach the Championship play-offs.

His suitors have already held initial talks with Liverpool but have been awaiting a final decision on whether Brewster would be made available for a permanent transfer or only on loan.

Blades boss Chris Wilder is hoping to sign a striker before his side’s trip to Aston Villa on Monday.

As revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday, they made a £3m plus add-ons approach for Arsenal youngster Folarin Balogun.

Sheffield United also retain an interest in Newcastle's Dwight Gayle despite his injury

Crystal Palace have bolstered their striker options this summer with the addition of Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea.

But they are keen to offload Christian Benteke and have also brought in extra funds by agreeing a deal to sell Alexander Sorloth to Trabzonspor.

The Norwegian frontman was midway through a two-year loan at the Turkish club who had an option to buy him permanently for £5.5m next summer.

As a result Palace had to strike a deal with Trabzonspor in order to sell him, with the two clubs deciding to split the £20m fee.

Sorloth was the subject of tentative interest from Tottenham but chairman Daniel Levy was reluctant to spend a significant sum on a player who had struggled in England.

Sorloth joined Palace for around £9m in January 2018 but scored just one league cup goal in 20 appearances for the Selhurst Park club.

Meanwhile, right-back Nathaniel Clyne is back training with Crystal Palace for the rest of September as he bids to regain full fitness.

Clyne, who began his career at Palace before moves to Southampton and Liverpool, is a free agent after leaving the champions this summer.
