They announced that they had made the 'difficult decision' to separate Friday afternoon on social media.

Now friends on Christina and Ant Anstead say they were 'shocked' at the announcement.

A source close to the couple told Us Weekly that the two kept their decision to end their marriage of less than two years to themselves.

'Christina and Ant have been very private about this and friends are shocked to hear the news because they seemed happy together publicly and while in front of others,' the source explained.

The 37-year-old Flip Or Flop star revealed Friday on Instagram that she and Ant had made the 'difficult decision' to end their marriage.

The real estate agent shared a contemplative shot of the soon-to-be ex-couple for her 1.4 million followers, showing them silhouetted against the sunset while walking on a beach.

'Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate. We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority,' she captioned the photo.

'We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future.'

She and the For The Love Of Cars presenter, 41, wed on December 22nd, 2018, and share son Hudson London, whose first birthday they celebrated earlier this month.

Christina recently unveiled the ninth season of her HGTV real estate show Flip Or Flop with ex Tarek El Moussa, to whom she was married from 2009 until 2018.

She and Tarek share daughter Taylor, nine, and son Brayden, five. 

Ant, for his part, also has children from a previous marriage, to Louise Anstead: daughter Amelie, 19, and son Archie, 14. 

'We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future,' Christina said in Friday's post; seen earlier in their relationship on Instagram 

The news of Ant and Christina's split comes after the British born Ant was recently able to fly home to be with his older children after a months-long delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in lockdown, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.

The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between himself and his kids.

Better times: Ant had lamented being separated from part of his family due to the pandemic and said the separation wasn't easy; seen on Instagram with their blended family

However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family all together.

'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.

Clearly, the stresses of this year also took their toll on his relationship with his second wife, in spite of a cheery post in August celebrating their dating anniversary. 

It remains to be seen whether Ant will stay across the pond, or return to co-parent his young son in Orange County, California with Christina.
