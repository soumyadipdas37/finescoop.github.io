Argan oil is a naturally occurring plant oil which derives from the kernels of the Argan tree, native to Morocco. Rich in fatty acids, squalene and vitamin E, the special ingredient has been nourishing skin and hair for hundreds of years.

The miracle oil has been infused with thousands of beauty products, including those by luxury haircare brand, OGX, who specialise in a wide range of moisturising and hydrating shampoos and conditioners, as well as a premium range of hair oils, serums, primers, styling products and intensive treatments.

One product beauty lovers are particularly loving recently is the OGX Argan Oil of Morocco Heat Protection Spray, with fans praising the spritz for leaving tresses 'soft and undamaged'.

 OGX Argan Oil of Morocco Heat Protection Spray is currently under £5 on Amazon

Even better, the number one Amazon bestselling heat defence spray is enjoying a 33 per cent discount in the Amazon End of Summer Sale, meaning you can save yourself a couple of quid and pick up a bottle for under £5.

This style saviour is designed to protect hair against damage from daily blow-drying, straightening and curling, while also replenishing a glossy shine.

The formula also helps to cut down on blow dry time, which is ideal if you have thick, bushy hair. It also gives you flexible control for super shiny and bouncy blow outs.

For best results, OGX recommends spritzing daily onto damp hair from root to tip before blow-drying, straightening or curling for healthy-looking natural style and shine.

One Amazon customer wrote in their review: 'Incredible product, it leaves an extremely nice smell and protects perfectly against the heat of the hairdryer.'

Another added: 'The OGX Heat Protectant Spray smells and feels nice when applied to my hair and it doesn't leave a nasty residue. It seems to do the job just fine so will be buying this again.'

If you're already a fan of this heat protect spray, you might also like to try out OGXs other luxury styling products from the Flexible Control range such as the Tame and Shine Cream (also currently £4.99) and Sea Salt Wave Spray.
