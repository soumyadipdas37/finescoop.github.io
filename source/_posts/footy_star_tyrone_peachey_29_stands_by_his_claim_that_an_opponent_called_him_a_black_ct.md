The NRL has been rocked by yet another racist scandal, with Indigenous star Tyrone Peachey alleging he was called a 'black c**t' by an opponent. 

Peachey immediately approached referee Chris Sutton following the alleged on-field slur from Newcastle Knights back-rower Mitchell Barnett during Friday night's game.

'That back-rower (Barnett) just called me a black c**t,' Gold Coast Titans star Peachey said.

Despite Peachey's claim, Barnett has reportedly told Knights club officials he did not racially abuse the former Sharks and Panthers utility, according to The Newcastle Herald.

On field, Sutton repeatedly encouraged the Titans lock to make an official complaint, but Peachey declined to do so, meaning the referee was unable to take the allegation further. 

The NRL and the Knights will now launch a formal joint investigation into Peachey's allegations. 

The Titans are also likely to follow up the matter.

 'It is hugely disappointing to report an alleged racial slur in that game in which Tyrone Peachey was the victim,' Fox Sports presenter Jess Yates told Fox League viewers on Friday night.

'It was fairly obvious to hear what was allegedly said to him. It's highly disappointing to think that still exists in our game.

'There is absolutely no room for any racial slur or racial abuse, and if that is what happened tonight hopefully there will be an apology from that player.'

Last month Penrith centre Brent Naden made a complaint against crowd members after they racially abused him during a game on the NSW Central Coast.

The matter was closed after Naden recently accepted an apology from one of the men.
