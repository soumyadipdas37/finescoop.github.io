A savvy Australian mother-of-two has shared her easy recipe to make custard-filled cakes using her $29 sausage roll maker from Kmart.

Danni, from Melbourne, shared images to a popular Facebook group and said she's 'seriously addicted' to the fluffy cakes.

To make the easy dessert, she used a butter cake mix from Coles and a vanilla flavoured custard mix.

Although Danni used a 75-cent cake mixture, other foodies said the cakes looked 'delicious' and 'so good'.

To make the dessert, she followed the instructions on the back of the packets then poured the batter into the sausage roll maker and cooked for five minutes.

She then cut the cakes down the middle, made the custard and piped the filling inside the cake shells before dusting with icing sugar.

The easy two-ingredient idea was praised by other social media users online and is perfect to make with children.

Over the past six months, the Kmart sausage roll makers have proven to be very versatile as home cooks have made a variety of sweet and savoury meals using the kitchen gadget, including hotdogs, chiko rolls and banana bread.

In July another home baker made a similar dessert and shared how to make a doughnut-éclair hybrid dessert filled with jam and cream.

While the dessert looks like an eclair, it's made using a $4 doughnut mixture from Coles.

Yvonne, from Queensland, made the unique cakes using one packet of the 'Donuts with Glaze Icing' mix then cooked the batter in her sausage roll maker.

By using the Kmart gadget, Yvonne said the dessert only took eight minutes to cook and formed the correct shape perfectly.
