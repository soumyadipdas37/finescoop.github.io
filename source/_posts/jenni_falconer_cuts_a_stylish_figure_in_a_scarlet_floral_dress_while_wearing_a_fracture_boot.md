She sustained a stress fracture on her left foot during training for the upcoming virtual London Marathon. 

And Jenni Falconer put on a brave face as she wore her fracture walker boot while leaving Global Radio studios on Thursday after her Smooth FM show. 

The radio host, 44, didn't let her foot injury get in the way of her stylish ensemble as she made her way through central London. 

Ouch! Jenni Falconer put on a brave face as she wore her fracture walker boot while leaving Global Radio studios on Thursday after her Smooth FM show

Jenni highlighted her slender physique in the stunning floral wrap dress that tied at her waist. 

Her arm candy consisted of a large red leather tote bag that draped over her arm. 

The Scottish presenter protected her face with a pair of chic tortoiseshell frames, and she highlighted her natural beauty with a radiant make-up look. 

Jenni wore comfortable white trainers, a sensible choice given that she is required to wear the walker boot to allow her injury to heal.

On Monday, the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon.

She said: 'A few weeks ago I sustained a stress fracture on my 3rd metatarsal. Frustratingly it’s very hard to spot on an X-ray and so it took quite a while to diagnose.

'Anyway, it happened six weeks ago and thankfully it is repairing well so I have to wear a support boot whilst I’m walking around to limit further damage until it fully mends.

'It was a consequence of excessive running in lockdown whilst preparing for the virtual London marathon. 

'Sadly it means I can no longer run on October 4th but should be back running home from work in a month!'

Away from radio, it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.

The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.

Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers.
