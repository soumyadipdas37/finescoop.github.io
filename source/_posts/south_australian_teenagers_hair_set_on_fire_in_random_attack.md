'The victim did not know this woman, there was no conversation had between them,' a South Australian police spokesman confirmed.

The footage shows the moment the teenager first realised her hair was burning.

She immediately jumped to her feet and ran to the front of the bus, followed by her group of friends.

The woman quickly slipped off the bus and out of sight of cameras.

The woman, who police estimate was between 50 and 60 at the time of the attack on June 29, 2020, calmly set the teenage girl's hair alight after she sat in the seat in front of her

The driver called police immediately, but investigators have not been able to track the woman down.

Officers warned there is 'already trauma attached to the incident', particularly for the young victim.

'Physical, emotional and mental trauma. That's the sort of stuff that leaves scars for a long time,' the spokesman said.

Investigators are urging anybody with information about the incident to come forward, or call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.Â
