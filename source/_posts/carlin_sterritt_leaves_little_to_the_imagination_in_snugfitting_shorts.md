The Bachelorette's Carlin Sterritt has gained an army of female fans by showing his soft and caring side since his split with Angie Kent. 

But on Sunday, the personal trainer gave fans more than they bargained for when he stripped down to just a pair of snug-fitting sports shorts.

Taking to Instagram, Carlin let imaginations run wild as he posed in front of the mirror showing off his toned and tanned physique.

Hello! The Bachelorette's Carlin Sterritt, 32, (pictured) left little to the imagination while going shirtless in snug-fitting shorts for a raunchy mirror selfie on Sunday

Carlin wore just a pair of grey sleep shorts which hugged his muscular frame. 

'Ok, that's enough sun for a while,' Carlin captioned the post. 

Earlier in the day, the reality TV star had been soaking up the sun alongside his pals with him clearly enjoying himself. 

It comes after Carlin showed himself getting biblical-inspired tattoos on his Instagram Stories earlier this week.

Keeping the faith: Carlin got two biblical tattoos last Monday, after his split from Angie Kent in July 

On Monday, Carlin had a quill with a psalm verse etched onto one forearm, as well as a religious take on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man on one bicep. 

'If I rise on the wings on the dawn,' the verse surrounding the quill read.

This month, Angie, 30, revealed on radio that she and Carlin, who met on the 2019 season of The Bachelorette, called it quits because their 'values didn't align'.  

Religious: On Instagram Stories, the fitness trainer showed off a quill with a psalm verse on one forearm. The verse read: 'If I rise on the wings of the dawn' 

'Chemistry doesn't always equal compatibly,' she said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show.   

'Our values were different. I'm a little more spiritual, a little bit more carefree and wild. He's a Christian boy... we're just different.' 

The blonde beauty also told House Of Wellness that she has been seeking professional help with the heartbreaking split, dealing with feelings as they arise.

'I am navigating it all and dealing with the feelings and thoughts as they arise... and have an amazing therapist who is helping,' she told the website.

Intricate: Carlin also had a religious take on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man etched on one bicep. It represents what is thought to be the divine connection between the human form and the universe  

Meanwhile, Carlin told Instagram fans in July that their breakup had 'taken a toll' on him, while discussing his battle with anxiety.

The fitness trainer said: 'Everybody has actually been really kind. I had so much fear and anxiety about coming out about our breakup publicly.  

'It was actually quite debilitating each day when I was holding on to that truth. Yes we have come up with the decision [to split] recently, but I've just been so scared.' 

Not compatible: Angie revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show in September that she and Carlin called it quits because their 'values didn't align'
