An African history associate professor at George Washington University who has publicly identified as black since she was a teenager has now admitted she is actually white. 

Jessica Krug revealed on Thursday that she has falsely claimed to be black throughout her career. 

She made the revelations in a Medium post, saying she was a 'culture leech' and a 'coward'.  

It is reminiscent of the scandal involving Rachel Dolezal - a former NAACP leader in Washington state who was exposed in 2015 as a white woman pretending to be black.
