He missed out on winning his first ever Emmy Award, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, for his performance in Normal People at Sunday's ceremony. 

But Paul Mescal appeared to put his defeat behind him as he stepped out for a casual stroll in Milan, before enjoying a spot of fine dining during the city's Fashion Week on Wednesday.

The Irish actor, 24, cut a low-key figure in black sportswear, before putting on a suave display in a burgundy jumper for his evening outing with a pal.

Connell star Paul opted for comfort for his early appearance as he wore a hooded jumper with sporty shorts, white trainers and square-framed shades.

Hours later, the thespian puffed on a cigarette as he was seen leaving a restaurant in the fashion capital.

The hunk teamed his short-sleeved top with black trousers, a slick belt and smart shoes.

Earlier this month, the screen star lost the coveted Best Actor prize to Mark Ruffalo, who won for his work in I Know This Much Is True.   

After the ceremony, Paul's family jokingly called him a 'loser' with his musician sister, Nell, 17, taking to her Instagram Story to share a hilarious screenshot of the Mescals FaceTiming the actor.

In the snap, the TV star's mother was seen doing the 'loser' L-sign to her forehead while the rest of the relatives giggled. She captioned the screenshot: 'We still love you.'
