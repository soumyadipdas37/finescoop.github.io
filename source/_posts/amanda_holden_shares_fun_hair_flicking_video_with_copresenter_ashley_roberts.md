They have been presenting their Heart Breakfast radio show throughout the pandemic. 

And Amanda Holden and her co-presenter Ashley Roberts shared a fun video to Instagram on Tuesday after another day on air.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, and Pussycat Dolls star, 38, commanded attention as they strutted down the hallway at Global studios while flicking their hair. 

Fun times: Amanda Holden and her co-presenter Ashley Roberts shared a fun video to Instagram on Tuesday after another day on air

Amanda captioned the fun clip with 'because we're worth it' followed by a crying laughing emoji.

In the slow motion video, the two stars strutted down the hallway in sync as they sultrily flicked their blonde locks in time.

Amanda looked sensational as she displayed her toned figure in a green mini skirt and 'disco' T-shirt.

She finished her look with a pair of white heels which further highlighted her svelte physique.

Amanda styled her blonde locks into a glossy blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up.

Meanwhile Ashley looked effortlessly chic in a pair of white high-waisted trousers with an unbuttoned shirt tucked into them.

It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday.

The presenter slipped into a plunging gold metallic dress as she took her place on the socially-distanced judging panel

Amanda was in high spirits after being promoted to head judge for the semi-finals, as it was also revealed that her debut album Songs From My Heart had reached number one on the iTunes pre-order charts.  

Due to Simon Cowell's absence Amanda has been promoted to head judge, and she was quick to joke she'll be backing 'musical theatre all the way.' 

Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. 

The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.  

Wow! It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday
