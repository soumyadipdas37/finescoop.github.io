She previously told MailOnline she finally feels like her outside appearance reflects her inner self. 

She said: 'I wish I had started my transition sooner, rather than wasting time and money trying to become the man that I wasn't. 

'I am much happier now and feel more like myself.'   

Jessica has been trying to put a brave face on things following the sad loss of her father Roserval who died last month. 

She broke the news to her followers at the time and wrote: 'Today is a very sad day to me and my family ! Dad rest in peace !

'Papai descansa em paz ! Te amo (Father, rest in peace. Love you).'
