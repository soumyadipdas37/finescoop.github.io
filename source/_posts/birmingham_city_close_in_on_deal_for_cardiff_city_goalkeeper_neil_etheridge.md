 Birmingham City are closing on a deal for Cardiff City goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.

The 30-year old was a target for West Ham earlier in the window but, with David Moyes focusing their attentions on bringing in a centre-back, Etheridge is ready to make his move to Cardiff’s Championship rivals Birmingham.

Etheridge was Cardiff’s player of the year in 2019 but has been on the periphery under manager Neil Harris after picking up a hamstring injury last year and speculation over West Ham’s interest.

Etheridge also had interest from Aston Villa last season but, with his lack of match action, they moved on to other targets.

The Philippines international is now looking to link up with Aitor Karanka at St Andrews as he builds a squad capable of mounting a serious promotion challenge.
