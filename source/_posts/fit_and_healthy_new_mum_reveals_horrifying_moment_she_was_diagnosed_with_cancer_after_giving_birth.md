A young mother was diagnosed with cancer only months after giving birth to her baby and a year after her dream wedding

A young mother was diagnosed with cancer only months after giving birth to her baby and a year after her dream wedding.

Alana Roscio, 31, will spend the next four months undergoing chemotherapy in an Adelaide hospital after being diagnosed with breast cancer on June 10.

The 31-year-old had ignored a large lump in her breast, a warning sign she thought was simply a part of becoming a new parent.

'I just assumed it was a blocked milk duct or mastitis or something like that, so I just let it go,' she told Seven News. 

But the lump was actually an aggressive form of cancer.

She had no idea until she got it checked by doctors two months later on on advice from her mother.

'I was absolutely heartbroken,' she said. 

'I was really angry that I hadn't gone and checked up on it sooner.' 

The mother-of-one started treatment last month, and despite the cancer spreading to her lymph nodes she is staying strong in the face of adversity.

She will then undergo surgery and radiation therapy.

Mrs Roscio has vowed to beat the cancer so she can watch her daughter grow up.

'Yes it is an aggressive cancer, but not as aggressive as me,' she wrote in an emotional post on Facebook.

'Yes the road ahead is going to be tough, but not as tough as me. 

'I will survive, I will watch my daughter grow and I will be here until I am an old woman to appreciate every minute of my life with my husband, friends and family every single day!'

She is using the opportunity to urge other women to get their breasts checked rather than waiting before it is too late.

'If I can share one bit of advice about this to all my girl friends.. if you notice a lump, no matter how young.. GET IT CHECKED!' she wrote.

One in 3,000 pregnant women are affected by breast cancer.

Experts say expecting mothers should regularly check for lumps, and if they uncover anything unusual to see a doctor within two weeks.

Meanwhile a crowdfunding campaign is aiming to help cover the young family's medical bills, and living expenses over the next few months.

Since being set up a month ago the community has rallied together to raise more than $13,000 through Gofundme.
