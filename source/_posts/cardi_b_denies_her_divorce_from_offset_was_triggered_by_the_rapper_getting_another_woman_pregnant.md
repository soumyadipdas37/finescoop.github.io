Cardi B has debunked rumors that husband Offset got another woman pregnant.

In an epic Instagram Live rant on Monday, the I Like It hitmaker blasted 'blogs that have a certain type of hatred towards me' for spreading 'bull***t' about her Migos star spouse's rumored infidelity. 

'People were just flooding me with… "Oh, Offset got a girl pregnant." And this is where the s**t came from. Ain’t that about a b***h,' said the 27-year-old.

In a surprising move, the Bodak Yellow artist filed for divorce from her husband of three years last Monday.

'I want to address another bull***t that I heard,' Cardi continued. 'Another blogger claims that I am getting a divorce for attention. And it’s like, you think I’m going to pay a lawyer 20 thousand f***ing dollars?'

'They’re like, "I just find it so funny that Cardi is getting a divorce around this time she got a record called Me Gusta out.' First, of all, Me Gusta is not even my record, it’s Anitta‘s record. So I’m not even getting a huge piece of the song,' Cardi explained. 

'I get along with his mother very well. You think I’m gonna do that to her son for attention. Why do I need attention? You don’t see I have millions of f***ing followers?'

'Do you see that I have the number one song in the f***ing world? Why do I need attention? Why do I need stunts?'

In the Instagram Live, Cardi also included screenshots of a text conversation she claimed was between a blogger and a 'fan' that allegedly prove the rumors about Offset's infidelity stemmed from 'fake stories'.

Cardi -whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar- has 'not shed one tear' after filing for divorce from her husband-of-three-years Offset.

The rapper recently began divorce proceedings, but has insisted she is not upset about the break-up.

Speaking in an Instagram Live video, she said: 'I want to say thank you so much. However, like, I don't really need it. I'm okay. I want to let you know I have not shed not one tear.'

Although Offset, 28, who has two-year-old daughter Kulture with Cardi, reportedly cheated in the past, Cardi insisted this split was not caused by him being unfaithful.

She said: 'This time, I wasn't crying. Wanna know why? The reason my divorce is not because of none of that s*** that ever happened before. It's not because the cheating. I'm seeing people [saying] "Oh, he has a baby on the way." That's a whole f*** complete lie.'

The WAP star went on to reveal she and Offset called time on their relationship because they were constantly arguing.

She said: 'I just got tired of f***ing arguing. I got tired of not seeing things eye to eye. When you feel like it's not the same anymore, before you actually get cheated on, I rather just be… you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm tired of people.'

The marriage breakdown came after Offset and Cardi briefly split in 2018 before confirming speculation they had rekindled their romance when they attended the 2019 Grammy Awards together.

At the time, the I Like It rapper accused the Migos star of being unfaithful, but they were said to be trying to work things out for the sake of their daughter.

Offset made a number of public gestures to get Cardi back, including crashing her set at Rolling Loud festival in LA with a huge 'Take Me Back Cardi' sign made out of white and red roses.

Although she initially rejected his apology, he still thought it was the right thing to do.

He tweeted at the time: 'All of my wrongs have been made public, i figure it's only right that my apologies are made public too. A ***** was just trying .....thank god I ain't got no balloons sheeesh (sic)'.
