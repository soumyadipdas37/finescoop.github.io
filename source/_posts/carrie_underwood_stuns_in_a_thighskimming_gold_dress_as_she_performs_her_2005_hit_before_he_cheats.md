Carrie Underwood put on a mesmerizing performance of her hit, Before He Cheats, while performing in the 2020 Academy of Country Music Awards's opening number.

As she crooned the ever-popular 2005 breakup track, the 37-year-old performer commanded attention in a thigh-skimming gold dress, matching microphone and sky-high heels. 

After strutting across the stage of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, Underwood soulfully performed to an empty room, as live audiences were scrapped due to social distancing regulations.

While Luke Bryan sang his track, Rain Is a Good Thing, Eric Church performed Hurricane from the Bluebird Cafe and first-time EOTY nominee, Thomas Rhett, followed up with It Goes Like This.  

While the country stars up for the evening's top prize all received online praise, viewers went wild for Underwood's iconic song choice and show-stopping vocals.
