Andy Cohen dismissed rumors Caitlyn Jenner and bestie Sophia Hutchins are set to join The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.

The Bravo ringmaster didn't beat around the bush when asked about the casting gossip on his SiriusXM channel Radio Andy.

In fact, he claimed Caitlyn and Sophia's camp was actually the source of the rumors, telling fans: 'This is one of those where the call is coming from inside the house people, as they say.'

'The call is coming from inside the house:' Andy Cohen completely dismissed rumors that Caitlyn Jenner and Sophia Hutchins are in talks for The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, saying that gossip was started by the duo themselves. Seen in February above

Andy went on saying: 'I know that they have expressed their interest publicly.'

Though they haven't been shy about their wants, Cohen said they've never been 'formally' considered for a role.

'On social media they've tagged me in posts saying we think this is a great idea, but, um, it is not, we've never talked to them formally and that is only… That, that, that rumor is not true.'

When asked if he thought Caitlyn would make a good addition to the cast, he was less direct, hinting he wasn't sure if she was close enough with any of the castmates to keep the show organic.

He mentioned the athlete's ex wife Kris Jenner, explaining how rumors about her coming to RHOBH made much more sense. 

'The thing about it is Kris was, Kris is good friends with Kyle, like, they are legitimately really good friends. Um, and so, yeah, I know. I just don't see it.'

Kris and Andy have both staunchly denied the supreme momager was getting her diamond, with Jenner recently telling Ellen DeGeneres: 'There’s just too much going on in my life and they do not need a Kris Jenner on that show. They are doing just fine.'

Just Monday Page Six reported the Secrets Of My Life author Caitlyn and her constant companion Sophia were in talks for the reality show.

Not interested: Andy and Kris Jenner have both denied rumors she is joining the Housewives, but Cohen did hint she would be a better fit cause of her friendship with Kyle Richards

According to their source the pair 'mutually decided to try the new reality show together' and Caitlyn was 'pushing for Hutchins to be cast.' 

The swirl of casting gossip comes after word of two BH ladies departures.

Denise Richards announced she would not be returning for the drama after a roller coaster season 10 filled with accusations of lying and cheating. 

Meanwhile Teddi Mellencamp revealed in September her contract was not renewed for the upcoming season.

It is still yet to be seen who will join Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley, Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi and Garcelle Beauvais for season 11 of the Bravo hit.
