Newcastle United have sounded out corporate box holders about returning to St James' Park on October 3, with Premier League clubs increasingly confident that fans will be able to attend matches from October.

Sportsmail understands that those supporters who have private boxes at Newcastle are being told to plan for a return for the home match against Burnley, with 50 per cent capacity in their room.

The club have used the corporate boxes to house media since football returned after lockdown and the protocols are already in place for those areas.

They are now working towards getting as many supporters inside St James' as is safe from the start of October.

Box holders are the first to be consulted and the next step will be finding a way to include season-ticket holders on long-term payment plans.

Although exact numbers are yet to be determined, it is hoped that significantly more than a third of the 52,000 capacity will be able to attend matches at St James' once it is given the sign off by the Premier League.

The League, meanwhile, say they are 'working towards' fans returning to stadiums in October in light of the weekend trial at Brighton, which saw 2,500 supporters watch their friendly against Chelsea.
