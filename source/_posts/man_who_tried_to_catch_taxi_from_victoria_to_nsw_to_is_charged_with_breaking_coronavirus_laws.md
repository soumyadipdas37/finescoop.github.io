NSW Police have charged a man with breaching a coronavirus direction after he allegedly tried to cross the NSW-Victoria border in a taxi to go shopping in Albury.

Police say they stopped a Victorian taxi at about 4.30pm on Saturday at a checkpoint on the Hume Highway at Albury.

The passenger, a 26-year-old man, told police he wanted to go shopping in Albury but when asked to produce a permit it was found to be invalid, police said in a statement.

He was arrested and taken to Albury Police Station where he was charged with not complying with a COVID-19 direction and breach of bail.

He was refused bail to appear at Wagga Wagga Bail Court on Sunday.

Meanwhile Victoria's 'roadmap' out of lockdown announced in early September is expected to be tweaked on Sunday following better-than-expected progress.

Under the original plans to take effect from Monday, the 9pm curfew would remain, as well as the 5km travel limit and takeaway-only for restaurants and cafes.

Restrictions around public gatherings would ease to allow up to five people from a maximum of two households to meet outside for social interaction.

The Victorian opposition is calling for rules to be loosened well beyond this, saying the curfew should go, all school students should return and restaurants, retail and offices should re-open.

It has been a dramatic few days in Victorian politics culminating in the resignation of Jenny Mikakos as health minister on Saturday morning.

To date, 782 Victorians have died of the virus and the entire state has been subject to strict lockdowns, workforce and school closures and prolonged social isolation.
