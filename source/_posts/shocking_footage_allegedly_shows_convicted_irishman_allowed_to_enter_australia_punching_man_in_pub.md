Patrick Farrell, 29, (pictured) is being sought over the attack on Oliver Solan on August 29, as well as a separate one-punch assault in Sydney in November 2019

Shocking CCTV footage allegedly shows the moment an Irish killer punched another man in a Sydney beer garden before going on the run after another frenzied knife attack. 

Patrick Farrell, 29, was allowed into Australia despite spending three years in jail for the violent death of 20-year-old student Andrew Dolon in his hometown of Kildare in Ireland in 2013.  

Officers are searching for Patrick Farrell, 29, after victim Oliver Solan was left in a pool of blood in a corridor in a Randwick apartment block in Sydney's east on August 29. 

Police allege Farrell was part of a group involved in the attack on Mr Solan. He is also wanted over an assault on a man at Matraville in November last year.

Patrick Earle, 23, and his girlfriend Katie Aileen Murtagh, 26, have already been charged over the alleged attack.  

Video footage of the attack in Matraville shows the moment a group of men congregate in the bar before the victim lands on his back and the doorman rush to his aid. 

Police allege there was a verbal argument between Farrell and the victim before the Irishman allegedly hit him with a left-handed punch that knocked him unconscious according to the Daily Telegraph.

Security officers helped the pub patron who fell flat on his back before being taken to hospital for two days

In a separate attack in Randwick on August 29 Mr Solan was left with a severed ear and a punctured spleen which later had to be removed. 

Earle, Murtagh and Mr Solan had been drinking together at the couple's home on the night of the alleged stabbing.

An argument between the two men ensued, with Mr Solan allegedly the first to attack Earle causing injuries to his arm.

Mr Earle suffered a dislocated arm and cuts to his head before allegedly contacting his friend John Dunlea to ask for help.

At about 8.30pm, Mr Dunlea, along with two other Irishmen, Patrick Farrell and Christopher Morrison, arrived at the apartment complex where Murtagh let them in. 

Mr Solan was then allegedly stabbed several times. 

In Ireland in 2013, CCTV evidence shown to Mullingar Circuit Criminal Court during Farrell's case showed Mr Dolon put his hands out and begged 'please don’t hit me'. 

The footage showed the convicted killer hit the biomedical student twice, critically injuring him, and he died in hospital soon after.
