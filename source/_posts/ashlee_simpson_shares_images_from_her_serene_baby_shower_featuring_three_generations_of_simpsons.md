She's expecting a baby boy - her third child - and her second with husband Evan Ross.

And on Tuesday, Ashlee Simpson showcased her growing baby bump in a beautiful floral number shared a series of snaps from her serene baby shower.

The gorgeous image featured three generations of the Simpson family featuring Ashlee, 35, with her daughter Jagger, her sister Jessica Simpson with her daughters Maxi and Birdie and their mom Tina Simpson.

Jessica, 40, posed next to her rocking a floral maxi dress with a statement belt as her daughter Maxi, eight, held her little sister Birdie, one, in her arms.

This lady right here is someone we should all aspire to be... determined, hilarious, artistic, loving, soulful, wise, loyal and a champion of motherhood!!! I keep telling her that I looked like this 2 months pregnant. When she needs a good laugh I send her pics of my 3rd pregnancy journey! I love you and I can't wait to be an auntie of 3!'

Ashlee and husband Evan, an actor, singer and son of icon Diana Ross, welcomed Jagger in 2015.
