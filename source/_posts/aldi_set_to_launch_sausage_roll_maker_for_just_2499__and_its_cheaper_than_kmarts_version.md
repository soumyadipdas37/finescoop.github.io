Aldi Australia is set to launch a budget sausage roll maker for just $24.99.

The pastry maker will hit shelves for one day only on Wednesday, September 9 as part of the retailer's Special Buys 'kitchen refresh' catalogue. 

The cult gadget makes four sweet or savoury snacks, including sausage rolls and apple turnovers - and it's cheaper than Kmart's $29 popular model.

The kitchen appliance features non-stick cooking plates so home cooks can make pastry treats in just minutes with ease.

Tens of thousands of Australians are part of Facebook groups dedicated to sausage roll makers, with many cooking everything from spring rolls, banana bread and doughnuts to Mars Bar pastries and McDonald's inspired apple pies.

As part of the new Aldi range, shoppers can expect to find a 16-litre multi-function air fryer with oven, dehydrator and rotisserie functions for just $149.
