She recently announced she was expecting baby number two with Bachelor star Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson, after keeping it a secret for five months.

And on Tuesday, Laura Byrne openly discussed the 'weird' side of her second pregnancy during an extremely candid confession on her podcast, Life Uncut.

After stating she didn't want to focus on the 'glossy' side of being pregnant, the 31-year-old boldly told co-host Brittany Hockley: 'Your vagina starts getting fat and your nipples turn black... and why is there a beard growing on my stomach?'

She laughed: 'Pregnancy does the weirdest s**t to your body. All this weird stuff happens, and nobody talks about it!'

The reality star, who is currently 21 weeks pregnant, also claimed her nipples have 'grown really long', before describing to Brittany what she's expecting her private parts to look like when she hits the nine month mark.

'Mine doesn't look like it yet, but low and behold at nine months some people get a really swollen vagina,' she laughed. 'It looks like a chicken breast. Just think of a really juicy chicken breast.'

Telling the truth! The reality star, who is currently 21 weeks pregnant, revealed her nipples have also 'grown really long', before describing to Brittany what she's expecting her private parts to look like when she hits the nine month mark

The pair signed off the baby discussion with Brittany promising to keep fans updated on the 'progress of Laura's vagina' over the next few months.

Laura and Matty - who are one of the most renowned success stories from The Bachelor - announced their happy baby news on Thursday. 

'I reckon we've kept this little beach ball under wraps for long enough..... Half way to number two,' Laura wrote in an Instagram post at the time.

Happy family! The pair became engaged in April 2019, and welcomed their daughter Marlie-Mae in June last year

'A big shout out to @matthewdavidjohnson for his contribution,' she joked.

Earlier this month, the pair celebrated their three-year anniversary after meeting and falling in love on The Bachelor exactly three years ago.
