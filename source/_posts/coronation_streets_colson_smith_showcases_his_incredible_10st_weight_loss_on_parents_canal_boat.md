He is known for his portrayal of the lovable Craig Tinker on Coronation Street. 

Yet off screen, Colson Smith has been keeping his fans updated with his incredible weight loss journey, after he revealed he's lost 10 stone throughout the pandemic.

The ITV soap star, 22, underwent a dramatic transformation after adopting a healthier lifestyle, which caught the attention of fans on Saturday as he displayed his new physique on social media.

Wow! Colson Smith has won the hearts of fans with his incredible weight loss journey after he previously revealed he's shed 10 stone throughout the pandemic

On Instagram this weekend, Colson uploaded a snap as he leaned on his parent's narrowboat named the Rag Doll and set sail around his local canal. 

He showcased his svelte frame in a black t-shirt and black shorts.

The Corrie actor looked effortlessly cool as he donned black shades and captioned the image: 'My parents let me drive for all of 6 seconds until we started heading diagonally down the Canal. #TheRagDoll'.

One fan said: 'Amazing weight loss man... I know what it takes! Weird that no-one in Corrie has commented on your character's weight loss though!'

Another added: 'Can I just say you are looking amazing! You’ve lost so much weight, keep it up pal x.'

A third follower wrote: 'Does anyone else think colson and ben price (Nick) are morphing into one person now?! You look incredible man, well done.'  

The soap star first showed off his impressive weight loss in March, but has been continuing to slim down while in lockdown as he kept up with his fitness routine at home. 

Colson recently spoke about how his staggering weight loss will likely cause continuity issues on Coronation Street during filming.   

The star joked he will have to wear a fat suit after claiming to have lost 10 stone during lockdown.

Colson told The Sun: 'We are in direct continuity, but I've almost lost about ten stone since we left work so I'm not sure that [my hair] is going to be the biggest of their issues.

'I might be wearing a wig and a fat suit when we go back. Now we go to a purple shampoo, which almost makes it a platinum sort of colour, which basically takes the ginger pigment out.

'So the yellow-ness will go, and I will have a head of blonde hair, which I technically do now.'

Amazing job: Amid the COVID-19 lockdown, Colson had been working on his fitness and often shared snaps of his workout routine
