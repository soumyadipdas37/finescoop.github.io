A transgender woman who gave a teenage runaway drugs has argued she should avoid jail because she'll vulnerable in custody due to her gender identity.

Susan Willan, 61, formerly known as David Willan, on Tuesday pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates Court to supplying a drug of dependence to a child.

The victim, 14, collapsed three days after Willan gave her four Valium tablets at Hungry Jack's in Newcomb in March 2019, and was taken to an intensive care unit.

Prosecutor Madeleine Sargent highlighted the large age gap between the victim and pushed for a jail sentence, the Geelong Advertiser reported. 

'Criminal offending against children should be denounced in the strongest possible terms,' Ms Sargent said. 

But Willan's defence lawyer Thomas Edwards described the offence as a 'momentary' judgement lapse and argued for a community correction order, as his client would be at risk in jail due to being transgender.

The court heard the crime took place after the teenager approached Willan in the restaurant car park and asked to use her phone.

Willan asked the girl if she had ever taken drugs before giving her the tablets, and the pair then went to Willan's nearby home where the teen slept on a couch.

Blood tests taken after the girl collapsed and ended up in ICU found Valium and other substances in her system.

The girl said in a victim impact statement read to the court she was 'taken advantage of' and did not know she had been given Valium.

'I did not realise what the drugs could do to me or what they were,' she said.

Willan will be sentenced on September 16.
