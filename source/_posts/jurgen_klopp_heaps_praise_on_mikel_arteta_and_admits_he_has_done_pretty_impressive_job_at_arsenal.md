Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was effusive in his praise of Mikel Arteta ahead of his side's clash with Arsenal on Monday night. 

Both the Reds and Gunners have taken six points from their opening matches in the Premier League, with Arteta continuing to build on his promising first season in charge at the Emirates Stadium.

Klopp praised the Spaniard, who led Arsenal to an unexpected FA Cup title last season and hailed him as an 'exceptional manager'.

Klopp hailed him an 'exceptional manager' for turning around Arsenal's fortunes last season

'I am not sure I should compare, but Arteta has showed in a short period he seems to be an exceptional football manager,' the Liverpool boss said in his pre-match press conference.

'The team he sets up now, the structure is exceptional. You can see the balance between defence and attack. Good organisation but freedom for players, uses them in right place. 

'He's done a pretty impressive job. He has changed the whole mood in the club, I don't think a lot of people thought he would have won anything but he did that with the FA Cup. 

'And now the English super cup, that's pretty impressive. They will be a tough opponent.'

Klopp said that Arsenal are very dangerous on the counter attack due to defensive structure

When breaking down the changes that Arteta has made with the Arsenal players, Klopp put it down to their defensive shape and warned they will have to be careful to not be caught on the counter attack on Monday night.

'It's their defensive structure, they defend properly,' he added.

'All the players are involved, they defend in a 5-4-1, when you have quality players it is tricky for the other team and then their speed on the counter can make them dangerous. 

'We have played them twice now and the super cup game (Community Shield) was an open game, we were unlucky. And the league game we helped them because we gave two goals on a plate. 

'I can say a lot of positive things about Arsenal but we still have a chance on Monday night.'
