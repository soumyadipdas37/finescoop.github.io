Her statement making baby shower look included a stunning high neck shift dress with bell sleeves and a pair of sandals. 

Teyana's hair - which also happened to be red - was parted down the middle and bumped under at the ends.

She rocked an ultra glamorous makeup look that consisted of a pair of dramatic false lashes, a generous amount of brown eyeshadow, and a glossy nude lip.

As she posed in front of a wall of pink and white balloons, Teyana held a red rose up to her face and tenderly cradled her baby bump.

Despite nearing her due date, Taylor has continued to provide her devout following with new music. 

On Wednesday, the singer dropped the emotionally charged music video for her powerful new single Still. 

The video explicitly honored the lives of prominent Black victims of police brutality in the United States, including Breonna Taylor, Trayvon Martin, Elijah McClain, and George Floyd.

Mixed among the footage of Black Lives Matter protests, Civil Rights era segregation, and horrific police brutality, Teyana donned an EMT uniform similar to Breonna's and she even played a violin, which was a direct homage to McClain.

'We are STILL emotional. We STILL keep fighting for love, justice. Yet we STILL keep losing our beautiful black lives. Where's our healing?' wrote Taylor on Instagram following the video's release.

'I shot this video a few months ago & it's crazy how to this day our cry for love is STILL so relevant today and plans to be for a very long time smh! WE DEMAND CHANGE!!!'
