Shock arrival! The couple surprised fans when they welcomed twins last week 

Last week, Dana and Lachlan surprised fans when they announced they had welcomed twins, having kept the pregnancy under wraps. 

In an Instagram post, Lachlan, 34, shared a photo of his newborn daughters resting with their mother Dana, 34, as he looked on lovingly. 

He wrote in the caption: 'Oh Lulu and Lottie, your mummy and daddy love you with all we have - you are both so beautiful - and I would love to sing to you both forever'. 

Neither Lachlan nor Dana gave any hint that they were expecting, and their social media accounts do not show many recent photos.
