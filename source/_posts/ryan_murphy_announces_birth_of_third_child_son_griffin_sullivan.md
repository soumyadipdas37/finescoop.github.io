Ryan Murphy and husband David Miller have welcomed a third child.

The Glee co-creator, 58, shared the happy news to his Instagram Tuesday, posting a heart-melting photo of his older boys Logan, seven, and Ford, five, holding their new brother close.

Griffin Sullivan Miller Murphy was born on August 18, weighing in at six-pounds 13 ounces, according to Ryan's caption.

Ryan revealed that he and his husband of eight years were having another child back in June in a self-penned piece for Architectural Digest, where he wrote: 'We are expecting another baby, a boy, in August,' adding that they are anticipating an 'attack of color and Legos and bright Magna-Tiles' coming to their home any moment.

The American Horror Story creator and his photographer husband's bundle of joy comes after years of focusing on son Ford's health. 

This past November Ryan revealed that the five-year-old was 'cancer-free' after being diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a type of cancer typically found in the adrenal glands - in October 2018.

Last year the Hollywood creator opened up about the experience while honoring Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment Chairwoman Dana Walden at Variety's 2019 Power of Women Luncheon.

While celebrating Walden for her work with the UCLA Jonson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ryan said: 'I still have not emotionally recovered, to be honest. But Ford has. He turned five a week ago. And I'm so proud to proclaim that he is cancer free.'

Talking about what he learned from Ford's battle, Murphy stressed: 'This is a disease that touches us all.'

'We must help and we must be prepared and we must be proactive,' he went on, before revealing he made a $10million donation to the Children's Hospital LA.

'There is now a wing dedicated under Ford’s name that specializes in helping children without our resources,' he went on.

While family is surely front-of-mind for the TV creator, Ryan is also busy with new projects.

Yesterday he shared a photo with the star-packed cast of his upcoming Netflix project The Prom, which features Meryl Streep, Kerry Washington and Nicole Kidman.

'Meet the incredible icon-packed cast of Netflix's THE PROM,' he wrote in the caption. 'A group of true troopers who buckled up and finished shooting during COVID so we could give everybody an inspirational aspirational story that we all need right now.'

He continued: 'Christmas is right around the corner...'

The Prom, directed by Ryan, is about a troupe of 'self-obsessed' theater stars that arrive to a small town in Indiana to support a high school girl who wants to take her girlfriend to prom.
