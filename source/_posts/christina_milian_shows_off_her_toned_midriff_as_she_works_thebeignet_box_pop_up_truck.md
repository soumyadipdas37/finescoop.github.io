Her and her best pal Elizabeth Morris launched their 'southern sweet treat brand' Beignet Box in the summer of 2019.

And Christina Milian was spotted manning the popular French pastry pop up truck at an outdoor shopping center on Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles. 

After serving up beignets to eager fans, the 38-year-old actress pushed her seven-month-old son Isaiah around in a leopard print stroller.

Christina showcased her enviably toned midriff in a white crop top and a pair of high waisted knit shorts.

She completed her casual ensemble by slipping into some aqua Nike trainers and throwing on some minimalistic gold jewelry. 

Her curly brunette hair was slicked back and secured into a stylish ponytail that flowed down her back.

The Bring It On star showed off her glowing complexion, while briefly removing her face mask to snap some pictures outside the Beignet Box truck with her crew.

Milian showed off some of the Beignet Box fun on her Instagram Story. 

She had an off white purse over her shoulder and a pair of sunglasses tucked into her hair as she looped around the shopping complex with her newborn son.  

Christina welcomed Isaiah on January 20 and shares him with her partner of three-years, Matt Pokora, 34.

"And so we begin,' captioned Milian on a January 20th Instagram post that gave fans their first glimpse at the couple's bundle of joy.

Though Isaiah happens to be Pokora's first and only child, Christina is also mom to 10-year-old daughter Violet Madison with her musician ex The-Dream, 42.

She was married to the Love King hitmaker from 2009 until their divorce in 2011. 

Milian met Pokora, a French singer-songwriter, while on a trip to the city of love in the summer of 2017.

The Be Cool actress was enjoying french cuisine at a local hot spot, when the restaurant's owner introduced her to Pokora, who happened to be dining there, as well.

'So we switched numbers, found out we had the same birthday that night, and it was like the stars aligned' explained Milian, while appearing on E! News' Daily Pop in 2019.

During their first meeting the handsome Frenchman confessed to Milian that he had a feeling they would go on to 'have a child together' in the future.

'I've never had anybody say that to me' said Milian, who explained to Pokora that she already had a daughter of her own.

To which he replied: 'Well, you don't have a son.'

The couple announced they were expecting their first child together in July of 2019.

Christina and Matt revealed that their impending child was male during an August gender reveal party, two years after their chance meeting.
