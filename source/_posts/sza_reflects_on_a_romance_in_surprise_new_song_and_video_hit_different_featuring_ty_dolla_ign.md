SZA is back and better than ever. Over three years since she released her debut album, Ctrl, the Broken Clocks hitmaker released a surprise new song and music video on, Thursday night.  

The 29-year-old singer (born Solana Rowe) joined forces with Ty Dolla $ign on the new track, Hit Different, which follows the two reflecting on a romance. 

She took control of the visuals for the song as well, in her first solo directing role, that sees her dancing with a crew of female dancers in a car yard, in a barn and floating in a pool.

New release: SZA is back and better than ever. Over three years since she released her debut album, Ctrl, the Broken Clocks hitmaker released a surprise new song and music video on, Thursday night 

The video opens with the SZA dancing in an all orange outfit among her dancers as she sings 'I was into you from the beginning even if you wasn't mine / Scared to admit my shortcomings led to overdraft in this affair.' 

Ty Dolla $ign (born Tyrone Griffin Jr.) joins her on the pre-chorus and chorus which, in part, they sing 'Hit different when I'm sittin' here alone / All by myself (Alone, all by myself) / Hit different when I think you might be / With somebody else.' 

Scenes flash of SZA dancing with her crew, to being solo in a baggy tee shirt outfit on hay bales, then to seductively posing in the back of a truck being lifted into the air, and finally to being covered in red paint in a barn and field. 

The song continues to follow the singers as they contemplate their respective love interests, though it can be painful.

That same month the Best New Artist Grammy nominee also teased the idea of a 'music dump' releasing songs she has made over the last few years.
