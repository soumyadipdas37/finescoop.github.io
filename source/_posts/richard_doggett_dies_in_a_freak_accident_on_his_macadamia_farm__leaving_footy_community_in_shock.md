The former boss of the Richmond Tigers has died in a tragic accident on his macadamia farm in northern New South Wales.

Richard Doggett, 72, was found dead on his property at Numulgi, near Lismore, on Friday.

Mr Doggett's former club posted a touching tribute on social media.

'Richmond is mourning the passing of 1980 premiership General Manager Richard Doggett,' it read.

'We send our deepest sympathy to Richard's family and friends.'

Mr Doggett died just days before the club was set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1980 Grand Final victory.

He spent two periods as the club's general manager, during 1979-1980 and again in 1986-1988. 

'He also served as the Club's Treasurer in 1979-80,' Richmond FC wrote.

Mr Doggett then became an executive at Conrad Jupiters Casino on the Gold Coast before moving to Numulgi 13 years ago.

Since then he has been heavily involved in the Macadamia nut industry.

He had been growing macadamia nuts on his property and was also the chairman of the Australian Macadamia Society.

'It's certainly a lot cheaper to buy a macadamia farm than to get a house in Sydney at the moment, so come on up. We want to see you,' he told the ABC in 2015.

In the 1970s, he worked at Wrest Point and was the driving force behind the first Staff association and staff Magazine INTERWREST. 

He then took on a position with the Southern Tasmanian Australian Rules association as Marketing Manager where he doubled the crowds in his first year.

His success there is what attracted Richmond FC to him - and he worked in marketing and as the club secretary before becoming director.

Friend Mick Caban wrote on Facebook that he 'had the honour of calling Richard my friend for over 45 years'. 

'Richard had a special gift of making people feel that they were special,' he wrote.   

Mr Doggett's social media pages are littered with photos of himself and his wife travelling the world and enjoying nights out together. 

A NSW Police spokesperson said a report is being prepared for the coroner but the death is not being treated as suspicious.
