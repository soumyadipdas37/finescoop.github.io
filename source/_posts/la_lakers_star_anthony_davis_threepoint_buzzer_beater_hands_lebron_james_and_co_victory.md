Anthony Davis landed a three-pointer on the buzzer to lift the Los Angeles Lakers to a thrilling 105-103 win and a 2-0 Western Conference final series lead over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.

Davis's channeled the inner spirit of former Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who seven regular-season buzzer-beaters are tied for the most ever.

Rajon Rondo then found Davis near the sideline, and the All-Star forward found the basket from long-range.

'Special moment for a special player. Happy to be a part of it,' said James.

Jokic had 30 points and nine assists for the Nuggets while Jamal Murray had 25 points.

Game three is on Tuesday night.
