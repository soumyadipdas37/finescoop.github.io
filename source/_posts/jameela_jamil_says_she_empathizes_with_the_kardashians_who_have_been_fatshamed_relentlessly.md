Jameela Jamil says that even though she has repeatedly called out the Kardashians for promoting detox teas and unhealthy body image, she is not trying to 'cancel' them — in fact, she has 'so much empathy' for them.

Appearing on The Papaya Podcast with host Sarah Nicole this week, the 34-year-old star of The Good Place recalled how the Kardashians would be 'fat-shamed relentlessly,' even while pregnant, so it's no surprise to her that they would be 'obsessed with their bodies.'

But the actress said that being victims of that is no excuse for them to turn around and promote a culture that is harmful and breeds unhealthy attitudes in young girls.

Feels bad: Jameela Jamil says she has 'so much empathy' for the Kardashians 

Cruel: Appearing on The Papaya Podcast with host Sarah Nicole this week, the 34-year-old star of The Good Place recalled how the Kardashians would be 'fat-shamed relentlessly'

Jameela spoke at length about how so many women in Hollywood — who already look thin and young and beautiful — have such terrible attitudes about their looks.

'I've met almost no one who has a healthy and balanced approach to their face and their body,' she said, noting that even those who perpetuate it are also victims of it.

'They are afraid of food, and they train three times a day, and they are consistently studying and analyzing themselves, and injecting themselves, and using injections to take fat out,' she said.

'And with the Kardashians in particular, look at what happened to them,' she went on. 

'I have so much empathy for what happened to them, because I used to be a huge supporter of them when they would be fat-shamed relentlessly, even during pregnancy.

'I've never seen a woman fat-shamed like Kim Kardashian in the midst of her late term of pregnancy,' she said plainly. 'And so of course they're going to be obsessed with their bodies.

'If a billionaire who has all that money, all that success, all this wonderful family and everything else that's going on around them, all of the privilege in the world, can still feel that they need to prove to the world that they are thin, and still prioritize that as a talking point around themselves, it means that that person had been fully corrupted by the media,' she went on, speaking more broadly about celebrities.

'I've never seen a woman fat-shamed like Kim Kardashian in the midst of her late term of pregnancy,' she said (Kim pictured in 2013)

Not OK: But even though she can 'feel sorry for that' and 'empathize' with that, 'it doesn't mean that we can enable them to recycle that culture and put it back out to other young girls'

But even though she feels bad for them, she said that the mistreatment they have faced for their bodies doesn't excuse them to promote a culture that promotes that same mistreatment of other girls and their bodies.

'Of course they're going to be obsessed with their bodies,' she said of Khloe and the rest of the Kardashians 

'We can understand that, and feel sorry for that, and empathize with that, but it doesn't mean that we can enable them to recycle that culture and put it back out to other young girls,' she said.

That is why, Jameela said, she is so outspoken about calling the women out when they have promoted things like detox teas — specifically, because of the message she fears young girls are getting. 

'I think sometimes some of the pushback I get is from adults who are like, "Yeah, we know that some of these diet teas aren't real" she said. 'Yeah, you do, because you're a grown woman.   

'I'm not here for you, I'm here for the 12-year-olds like me who didn't know that people had cosmetic surgery, private chefs, personal trainers, Photoshop assistants who work 24 hours a day, and they're wearing corsets all the time underneath their clothes.'

Jameela said she has no aim to be a 'punisher' or 'vigilante,' she just wants to wake people up.

'People think I'm trying to cancel the Kardashians and influencers. I'm not! All I'm trying to do is educate people,' she said.

Not a fan? Jameela has continued to speak out about the Kardashians even this week, slamming Kim for her Skims brand's new maternity line (pictured) 

Shapewear: She called them out on Twitter and Instagram, writing on the latter: 'Pregnancy is hard enough, with enough worries already'

And for her, the proof is in the pudding: Jameela said that sales of detox teas have gone down since she has done her 'crass' comedy bits on the subject, and that people only needed to realize that the teas were laxatives to stop buying it

'I made it embarrassing to sell diet and detox products, and I think that might be the proudest achievement of my entire life,' she said. 

Jameela has continued to speak out about the Kardashians even this week, slamming Kim for her Skims brand's new maternity line.

'I wish we could just Normalize just focusing on the inside of a pregnant body, not the outside,' she wrote on Instagram. 'You don’t need your shape corrected or hidden. 

'You don’t need an even more awkward obstacle between you and a p***. You just need to try and ride with this miracle and do your best to be as happy/comfortable as is possible within your circumstances. Pregnancy is hard enough, with enough worries already.

'And if you feel self conscious, you are not the problem, who can blame any of us for feeling bad, our society has failed us immensely, and we as a collective need to put more energy into pushing back against this so we can just let a b**** live!

Painful: Earlier this year, Kim was called out by Jameela after posting this picture of herself in shapewear before the 2019 Met Gala





'If I ever have a baby I’m welcoming the stretch marks, the new curves and I’m sure as shit not gonna rush to try and snap back, I’m just gonna let my body heal from the Massive event that has occurred inside my body,' she went on. 

Back in June, Kim shared a snap of the Theirry Mugler corset she wore to the Met Gala in 2019, saying that she had to learn how to breathe in the restrictive piece.

Jameela soon responded:  'I've received over 1000 DMs asking me to address this. The reason I didn't jump on it immediately isn't because I don't think the post was damaging and disappointing. I do. 

'It's because the fact that you're all messaging me about it, shows my work is done. I haven't been trying to cancel Kim K. I was always trying to arm YOU with the knowledge to recognise for YOURSELVES that this is a b******t expectation of women, developed by the patriarchy. 

'If YOU know that it's problematic, reductive and irresponsible for her to perpetuate such a heavily impossible beauty standard to her impressionable fans... then you're empowered and conscious and don't need me.

'Kim, like many of us, has had decades of body image issues and obsession. This has been HEAVILY perpetuated by how much the media scrutinised her and her sisters over their appearances. 

Sharing thoughts: In 2019, Jameela hit out after Kim said in an interview that they shill things like detox teas because they are easy jobs that don't take them away from their families 

'Their pockets are lined with the blood and diarrhea of teenage girls...' she said 

'She isn't actively trying to harm you. She's just so harmed and deluded into thinking this is what SHE needs to look like to be special and beautiful and she's spilling it out onto her following. Is this wrong? YES. 

'But I'm not sure she realises that she's doing to others what her idols did to her, in making her think a tiny waist is the key to femininity and sex appeal.

'We grew up in the era of Heroin Chic, where we were told you HAD to look like an addict starving to death, so to go from that..to being bullied about your body by the world?

'This toxicity from someone who is smart and knows better, is a sign that this is harm she can't stop doing. So there's no point in screaming at her. The smart thing to do is to protect YOURSELF.'

Jameela also denied trying to 'cancel' the family In a 2019 Bustle interview.

'I’m not trying to cancel anyone,' she said. 'I don’t want to beef with the Kardashians. They have a huge amount of influence. I just want them to use that for more good.'

She went on to praise Kim for her work in reforming the prison system, while also imploring her to stop advertising for detox companies like Flat Tummy Tea. 

'I think what Kim does with the prison system is really cool.' Jameela said. 'Stop selling laxatives and I’ll get off your d**k.'

 After the family spoke to The New York Times in March 2019, Jameela responded with a firestorm of tweets. 

'Essentially, 'f*** the young, impressionable people, or those struggling with eating disorders, we want the money,' Jameela replied to a comment Kim made about taking easy jobs that don't pull them away from their families.

'I have been given these same opportunities to flog this stuff, and I don't do it, so they don't have to. Thank you, next.' 

 Jameela continued: 'Their pockets are lined with the blood and diarrhea of teenage girls...'
