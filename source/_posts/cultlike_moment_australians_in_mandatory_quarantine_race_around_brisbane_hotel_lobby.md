An Australian stuck in mandatory hotel quarantine has shared footage of guests racing around the lobby during their 30-minute fresh air break. 

The person took the video on September 21 to show how desperate travellers staying at the Brisbane hotel are to get out of their rooms. 

They described atmosphere in the lobby, where guests raced around the perimeter in face masks, as 'almost cult-like'. 

The returned passengers (pictured) are all seen wearing face masks and walking around exercising in the hotel's lobby 'almost cult like'

'As part of our mandatory 14 day hotel quarantine, we're allowed downstairs in the hotel lobby for 30 minutes of fresh air,' the individual told Newsflare.

The returned travellers are all seen with their faces covered and walking in a circle in single file. 

'An interesting perspective of harsh Australian lockdown measures,' they said.

To curb the spread of the deadly COVID-19, Australians returning from overseas must undertake 14-days of hotel quarantine.

NSW, QLD and WA will increase their traveller intake as the federal government changes the cap on how many Australians can return home.

Returned passengers at a Brisbane hotel were permitted only 30 minutes of free time

Australia recorded 21 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, 15 of them in Victoria and the six in NSW all from hotel quarantine.

There were also a further five deaths recorded from Victoria  taking the state's death toll to 771 and the national figure to 859. 

The fatalities include two women in their 80s, a woman in her 100s, a man in his 70s and a man in his 90s, and all are linked to aged care 

The state's 14-day rolling case average continues to decrease lower at 29.4 for Melbourne and 1.1 for regional Victoria.

Melbourne is on the verge of easing restrictions following weeks of strict Stage Four restrictions which only allowed residents to leave their homes for four permitted reasons.
