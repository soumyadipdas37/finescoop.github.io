Grizzly bears were photographed viciously attacking each other as they battled over a fish in southwestern Alaska. 

The two brown-haired bears became aggressive as they came to blows over their food, digging their paws and teeth into each other. Photographer Kevin Dooley spotted the female bear, thought to be about 16 years old, fighting with the younger five-year-old male bear. 

 The younger bear initially caught a fish but when it was snatched away by the female, who had been tending to her two cubs, the male bear retaliated.

Mr Dooley, a 59-year-old safari leader, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, U.S., said: 'The female is the senior bear in the area. The younger male moved into the fishing area and caught his own fish while the mother was busy with her cubs.

'The mother bear saw all the action of the younger bear catching a fish in her area and attacked him and took the fish - she ended up with it.'
