Dancer and choreographer Derek Hough and his girlfriend Hayley Erbert enjoyed an afternoon of bike riding together on what turned out to be another scorching summer day in Los Angeles.

The couple, who both looked to be cruising on motorized bikes through the suburban streets, both had their protective masks handy as the COVID-19 pandemic still wages on in the Golden State.  

Their afternoon of leisure comes just a couple days after word was made public that Hough will be rejoining the ABC hit reality series Dancing With The Stars for the upcoming season 29.

Couples time: Derek Hough, 35, didn't let the rising summer temperatures stop him from enjoying a bike ride with girlfriend Hayley Erbert in Los Angeles on Saturday

The older brother of Julianne Hough dressed for comfort with the rising temperatures in light-red shorts, a grey tank top and white sneakers.

He also donned a black baseball cap and dark sunglasses which helped him navigate through the swirling streets as the sun glared down.

Erbert, a dancer and model who rose to fame on So You Think You Can Dance, kept pace with her beau in black shorts overalls and slips.

She also wore dark sunglasses and had her dark tresses worn long and with a part in the middle.

Dancing With The Stars makes its triumphant return for season 29 on September 14. 

Hough was not listed as one of the professional dancers featured that were announced in August, nor was he one of the celebrity dancers announced on Monday.

There's a possibility that he could be revealed as one of the new judges, since ABC has yet to confirm the judges.

Going strong: Hough and Erbert have been an item for five-year and counting.

Supermodel and veteran television personality Tyra Banks is taking over hosting duties, replacing original host Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews. 

Hough won the MirrorBall trophy a record six times during his time as a professional dancer on the competition show from 2007 to 2016.
