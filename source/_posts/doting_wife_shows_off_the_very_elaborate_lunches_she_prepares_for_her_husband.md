An Australian wife has showcased the elaborate lunches she prepares for her husband each day, wowing hundreds with the effort she goes to for him.

The lady cuts up multiple fruits and vegetables for her hardworking partner, organising them into bento lunchboxes so he can easily eat each piece on the go.   

'I don't have kids yet but I'm lucky to have a husband who lets me practice making fun lunches,' she captioned the photos of her masterpieces.

Some of the concoctions included boiled eggs, carrots cut into stars, sliced tomato and cucumber, cut up apples, quiche, salami, cabanossi and Oreos or a Milky Way bar of chocolate

Forgoing traditional toothpicks to help him pick up the tiny pieces of food, the woman had chosen ones with animals or eyeballs on the top, for a fun flair.

'That is actually the cutest thing ever. I have two kids and my partner is always so jealous of their lunch boxes,' one woman wrote underneath the snaps on Facebook.

'Love it! What a good wifey. But you didn't cut his grapes in half,' another lady joked.

A third added: 'You are the cutest ever. I'd love to send my husband to work with little flower and love heart cut out veg and see his work mates faces'

The doting wife said she and her husband had been trying to conceive over the past five years but due to 'medical problems' were having difficulties.

'So when we are graced with a baby I'm sure it will be very cherished and spoiled,' she said.

But one person wasn't so sure it was worth the amount of effort she was putting into the lunchbox designs, commenting 'geez who has the time?'

'I do the same but mine never look this good! I'd rather spend the time with my girl than hours making pretty lunches. But that's me,' the commenter continued.

The original poster snapped back by saying she 'makes the time' for them, usually before going to bed, and they're made with lots of love.

'The effort is worth it,' she said.
