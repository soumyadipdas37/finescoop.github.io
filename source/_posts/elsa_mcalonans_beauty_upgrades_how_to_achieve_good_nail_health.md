WHAT'S NOW AND HOW TO DO IT: THE NEW RED 

It’s a classic hue that never goes out of fashion. The top nail brands have uncorked their new autumn colours and red wine shades are more popular than ever. 

As we enter the new season, the timeless classic colour, reliable red, is back on the scene and more popular than ever. Picture: Stock

The new OPI Muse of Milan Collection Complimentary Wine Nail Lacquer (£13.90) is a lustrous velvet burgundy

While Peacci’s Ruby Port Nail Polish (£10) is a rich, dark crimson.  

For speed, the new Essie ExprEssie Quick Dry Formula Chip Resistant Nail Polish in Not So Low Key (£7.99) is the fastest drying. 

A good budget buy, and good for nail health, is Barry M’s new Air Breathable Nail Paint in After Dark (£3.99).  

RACE YOU THERE  

On sale today: a good foundation that’s also a budget buy.

Perhaps that’s because the new Essence Pretty Natural Hydrating Foundation (£4.99) was developed after the brand held workshops asking customers what they look for in a make-up base. There are 31 shades. 

It has a superlight texture that provides good coverage and a moisturising formula (which includes aloe vera) for a long-lasting, natural-looking matte finish.

RIHANNA'S NEW SKINCARE 

Rihanna has released a new range of skincare as part of her best-selling Fenty Beauty line

Fenty Skin is the latest range from Rihanna, following on from her best-selling make-up line Fenty Beauty.

Launching with three products, Total Cleans’r Remove-It-All-Cleanser (£20), Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum (£25) and Hydra Vizor Invisible Moisturiser Broad Spectrum SPF30 Sunscreen (£30, fentyskin.com), the ethos is clean beauty. 

Expect vegan, gluten-free and oil-free formulas with scents of cherry, coconut, fig and melon.

IS THERE A NICER WAY TO WEAR A MASK?  

A university hospital in San Antonio, Texas, found medics who spritzed their masks with aromatherapy oil not only found the masks smelled better, but the oil helped with breathing, too, creating a sense of calm. 

Some of us don’t feel comfortable wearing face coverings, but according to Sinead Duffy, founder of aromatherapy brand Yogandha, even the smallest drop of precious oils can transform the experience of wearing a mask.

‘Not only do oils smell nice, but they can support the respiratory system and calm you down if you feel anxious,’ she says.

Spray your mask with new Love Joys Mask Mist (£12).

 

THIS WORKS 



Fans of beauty capsules will be familiar with Elizabeth Arden’s pioneering products. The brand’s latest launch is Hyaluronic Acid Ceramide Capsules Hydra-Plumping Serum  (£45 for 30), which hydrates skin leaving a dewy glow. 

THREE OF THE BEST DRY SHAMPOOS 

In your 50s 

Batiste Skinnydip Nice Dry Shampoo (£2.99) is a sweetly-scented spray that instantly refreshes hair. It has been designed with accessory brand Skinnydip. 

 

In your 60s 

Innersense Refresh Dry Shampoo (£22) has a foam-to-powder texture that feels like it’s soaking up oil. It dries up greasy roots using witch hazel and tapioca starch while adding fullness to hair.

 

 

In your 70s

Amika Phantom Hydrating Dry Shampoo Foam (£10) is perfect for all hair types and has a foam texture that absorbs oil. It dissolves instantly without leaving a sticky residue.

 

SHAMELESS INDULGENCE 

Voce Viva, the new scent from Valentino, now has a big voice behind it, as the Italian couture house has appointed pop star Lady Gaga to sing the fragrance’s praises in its publicity campiagn. (Voce Viva translates from the Latin roughly as ‘living voice’.)

The fragrance (from £55, nationwide from October 4) is a bouquet of white flowers, combined with orange blossom absolute, golden gardenia and a woody base of crystal moss and Madagascar vanilla absolute.

Fashionistas will notice that the little gold spikes running up the lid of the bottle are a nod to Valentino’s popular Rockstud shoes, beloved by celebrities including JLo, Reese Witherspoon and, we now assume, Lady Gaga.
