Cynthia Nixon has revealed that she thinks Sex In The City looks 'very dated now' and particularly in how 'white it was'.

The actress turned political activist, 54, played Miranda Hobbes in the show which ran for six seasons between 1998 and 2004 before being made into two films.

Talking with the Radio Times, Cynthia discussed how although there are aspects of the show which haven't aged well other parts have stood the test of time.  

Reflection: Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda Hobbes in the hit show, has revealed that she thinks Sex In The City looks 'very dated now' and particularly in how 'white it was' 

Cynthia said: 'There are things about Sex and the City that look very dated now; certainly how white it was. Even at the time, we were very aware of that. 

'However, it was revolutionary in terms of the age of the characters. We were all over 30 when it started. And as it went on, we were quite a bit older than that. 

'Sex and the City showed the world that women aren’t completely marriage-minded. It showed how women are deeply interested in sex and really care about it.'  

Also during the interview Cynthia shut down suggestion that she could return to the role of Miranda, instead focussing on her upcoming projects. 

Stars: Cynthia appeared in the series and later two films alongside Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie, Kim Cattrall as Samantha and Kristin Davis as Charlotte (pictured in 2008)

Cynthia appeared in the series and later two films alongside Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie, Kim Cattrall as Samantha and Kristin Davis as Charlotte. 

During her Radio Times interview, Cynthia also said it was great to see more female producers, writers and directors making content.

Cynthia is next appearing in Netflix series Ratched alongside Sarah Paulson. 

She explained how the series is great for promoting a problematic female lead, something which previously has been more common with male characters. 

Some positives: Despite having some aspects which haven't aged well, Cynthia said SITC 'was revolutionary in terms of the age of the characters' (pictured in movie Sex In The City 2)

Since leaving SITC, Cynthia has become a political activist and campaigned to be the governor of New York in 2018.

Reflecting on 2020, she explained how although 'not thrilled' to be living during the coronavirus pandemic and Trump presidency she was 'very grateful' as a LGBTQ person at this moment in time.

Cynthia added: 'My greatest and most immediate hope is that Donald Trump is not re-elected president.'

It comes after Cynthia said she doesn't get where J.K. Rowling is coming from with her take on the trans community.

The 54-year-old star, speaking with Independent, said she was confused by the Harry Potter creator's remarks earlier this summer and that her son Samuel, who is transgender, took the remarks to heart after growing up with the Potter anthology.

'It was really painful for him because so much of his childhood was tied up with Harry Potter,' Nixon said, adding, 'We’re a Harry Potter family.' 

The Manhattan native said that Rowling's remarks directly contradicted the ideas put forth in her literature.

'The books seem to be about championing people who are different, so for her to select this one group of people who are obviously different and sort of deny their existence, it’s just… it’s really baffling. I know she feels like she’s standing up for feminism, but I don’t get it.' 

Cynthia also said that she and Samuel were able to set apart the art from the artist, and their enjoyment of the Potter films has not waned amid Rowling's comments.   

Rowling made headlines in June after she sent tweets responding to a Devex opinion piece that used the terminology 'people who menstruate.' 

The latest: Cynthia recently said in an interview that JK Rowling's remarks about trans people earlier this summer left her baffled and upset her trans son
