She's been forced to delay her nuptials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

But Anthea Turner still cut a stylish figure as she headed to the shops on London's King's Road with her fiancé Mark Armstrong, 55, on Saturday.

The presenter, 60, went makeup free in a cosy nude jacket and ripped jeans as she headed home with her purchases.

Anthea showed off her chic fashion sense by opting for a stylish nude coat along with blue ripped jeans.

The former GMTV host displayed her flawless complexion by going makeup free for the outing.

Both Anthea and Mark had clearly indulged in some retail therapy, as they headed home laden with shopping bags.

Anthea and Mark were scheduled to tie the knot this month in Italy, but were forced to postpone their nuptials due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Anthea told HELLO!: 'Mark and I had planned to go out and look at venues in March and then set a date for September.

'Mark is from Italy, his family are from Milan, so it seemed the perfect place for us. 

'It will be next year now. I am not even in any angst about it. When we do it, it will be small and cute, just with our close friends and family.'

The TV veteran was previously married to ex-husband Grant Bovey for 13 years, but the couple split after he cheated on her with a woman half her age in 2013.

Anthea's first marriage was to her manager, former DJ Peter Powell, in 1990, with the couple splitting up eight years later.

On finally finding The One, the media personality gushed about her man of 13 months, who had planned a trip to Rome for her 60th birthday: 'Mark is the absolute love of my life, we adore each other.

'He makes me smile every day and we are excited about our life together. Sometimes, when you are a bit older and you have lived, something tells you this is so right, you just know. 

'People might say why do you have to get married, or why would you want to. It is because I do believe in marriage, and I can't think of a nicer person to be with for the rest of my life.

'I've always said I would get married again, I knew I would meet someone, that I would not be on my own. I definitely never put up the shutters to finding love again, with 'keep away' tattooed on my forehead.'
