He has been distracting his wife with cheeky innuendos and pranks during the coronavirus pandemic. 

But Stacey Solomon finally got her revenge on Joe Swash as she shared a 'floppy nose' filter which enlarged his snout for the whole word to see. 

In response, The EastEnders' actor, 38, chased his TV host partner, 30, around their house and hilariously threatened to put his 'willy in her nose' on Sunday afternoon. 

Revenge: Stacey Solomon posted a hilarious yet phallic 'floppy nose' filter of her partner Joe Swash to her Instagram story on Sunday while he was fast asleep at their Essex home

During the Bank Holiday weekend, she shared an unflattering snap of her boyfriend sound asleep on their bed, with an Instagram filter that distorted and enlarged his nose. 

When Joe, found out, he was not a happy bunny and felt the image filter looked phallic. 

To get his own back, he cheekily chased down Stacey and shouted: 'My nose?! I'm gonna put my willy on your nose.

Caught out: When the EastEnders' actor, 38, discovered what she had done, he chased his partner, 30, around their house and amusingly threatened to put his 'willy in her nose' 

'Come on, how do you like it? I'll put my willy on your nose.'

The Loose Women panellist filmed the amusing interaction as she hid behind her bathroom door, while Joe poked his head around the door. 

Stacey responded in a surprised manner: 'Oh my God, you can't do that!'

She also captioned the humorous video on her Instagram story: 'When he finally gets round to watching my Instagram stories.

Hiding: The Loose Women panellist filmed the interaction as she hid behind her bathroom door, while Joe poked his head around the corner and she said: 'Oh my God, you can't do that!'

'It's not a willy @realjoeswashy it's just a floppy nose,' accompanied by laughing emojis.

Stacey shares a 14-month old son, Rex, with Joe and also has two sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, from a previous relationship. 

Joe, 38, is also the father to Harry Swash, 13, who he shares with his ex-partner Emma Sophocleous. 

Earlier in August, Stacey revealed on Loose Women, that the couple plan to foster children in the future.

The panel's debate was prompted by Gary Lineker's announcement that he will welcome migrants into his £4million luxury London townhouse after being called out by a Tory MP.

Stacey said: 'I think we should look at how we can help in the community. 

'Joe's mum is a foster carer and she is brilliant at it. We've both had the discussion when our children leave home and they go off and do their own thing, it's something that we would absolutely love to look into. 

'But I think you're right you have to look into your own circumstances and what can you offer, what do these people actually need and go from there.' 

Growing family? Earlier in August, the mother-of-three revealed on Loose Women that she plans to foster children in the future with her partner Joe after being inspired by his mother
