Khloe Karadashian gave fans an up-close look inside her garage in the premiere season of Netflix's new show Get Organized with The Home Edit, showing off her incredible merch stockpile, her painting station, and her daughter True's enviable collection of mini luxury cars. 

The 36-year-old reality TV superstar is a longtime fan and client of The Home Edit founders Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin — and in one of the first episodes of their new show, Clea and Joanna return to Khloe's house to give her spacious garage an organized makeover.

Khloe thrilled with the results, saying: 'I don't know how they did all that in just a few hours. They're like little wizards. They just do it.'

Check it out! Khloe Karadashian gave fans an up-close look inside her garage in the premiere season of Netflix's new show Get Organized with The Home Edit

Cleanup! She uses her garage to house lots of stuff but wanted everything organized a bit better

The pros: The Home Edit's Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin have already organized the rest of Khloe's home

Before: Khloe's garage wasn't exactly a mess before, but it had a 'mish-mosh' of items all over the place

Toys: True's collection of luxury cars was mixed in with strollers and a clump on one side

Needs a bit of work: She also had some loose cleaning supplies out near her painting area

New show! Netflix debuted the new series today

The third episode of the first season, which debuted on Netflix today, starts with a planning session in which Clea and Joanna shared their excitement over going back to Khloe's house. 



'It's the most exciting house that could possibly exist for us. It's like organizing a museum anyway,' Clea says.

The pair has 'already worked [their] way through most of the house' — and reworked their way through it again — but they'd never touched the garage before, and they were thrilled.

'Not to play favorites, but she is one of our favorite people ever,' says Clea. 'She understands us, she gets organization. To be honest, she could really just do it all herself.'

The warm feelings are clearly mutual, and Khloe welcomes them to her home with a huge smile.



'I'm always excited to see you. I think it just gets better and better,' she tells them.

'I'm always excited to see you. I think it just gets better and better,' Khloe tells them

Ready to go! The women quickly get to work, pulling everything out to put it back in with a better system

Good American: Everything went into clear boxes which got custom labels

Speedy: The organizing pair managed to do the whole thing in just one day

Swag: Khloe has a lot of extra merch from her and her family's product lines

Drive-in: There also needed to be a better system for True's cars

'The way I feel when Joanna and Clea come to my house, any time they come, it's just a sense of relief,' Khloe says

'The way I feel when Joanna and Clea come to my house, any time they come, it's just a sense of relief,' she adds to the camera. 'I know that something is gonna get done the way that I would do it myself. I'm so particular and I'm very OCD in certain ways, and they don't judge me for that.'

Though she's 'absolutely crazy' about organizing, she admits to the women that she doesn't pay much attention to her garage, and it's organized 'in the worst way possible' with 'a mish-mosh of stuff.' 

Still, when the three women walk into the garage, they reveal an are that's not actually that messy. Clear bins hold some things in storage, True's ride-in toy cars are all lined up, and a designated painting area with easels sits in the middle.

Khloe explains that she started painting while pregnant and realized she liked it for therapeutic reasons — and is actually 'kind of good at it.'

There are a few random things thrown in, though, like extra high-chairs for visiting nieces and nephews and a bike that Khloe admits she doesn't know how to ride.

Plus, inside her house she has a closet full of merch from her various product launches — which she keeps in case she needs to give some to people — and she wants to move all of that to the garage.

 Khloe said: 'I know that something is gonna get done the way that I would do it myself. I'm so particular and I'm very OCD in certain ways, and they don't judge me for that'

Amazing! She was thrilled by how immaculate the garage looked when the women were done

Khloe comes back to see what they've done, exclaiming, 'Oh my god!'

A spot for everything: There is a parking lot for True's cars, with spaces made using pink tape

The view: Khloe's art station has been turned around so she can look outside while she paints

Nice! Khloe explains that she started painting while pregnant and realized she liked it for therapeutic reasons — and is actually 'kind of good at it'

Smart! They put her supplies on a cart that can be easily wheeled around

Khloe leaves them to it for several hours, and the women get organizing with a professional team.

At the end of the day, Khloe comes back to see what they've done, exclaiming, 'Oh my god!'

The right wall is now lined with identical black shelving units outfitted with clear containers — all of which are meticulously labeled with white letters.

Here, Khloe now has all of her merch overflow, including Good American jeans, makeup from her collaboration with Kylie cosmetics, and pieces from her sibligns' brands. 

On the floor on the right side of the garage, True's luxury cars are perfectly lined up in a mini parking lot, with designated spots created with light pink tape. The strollers that had previously been crammed in with them now have their own separate spot.

'I don't know why I never thought of this!' says Khloe. 'It's so excellent!' 

More shelving units on the back wall hold Khloe's gift section, including spare baby shoes, books, fragrances, and blankets.  

Shelving: Behind the cars are shelves holding all of the merchandise in clear bins

Want! Khloe has lots of stuff from Good American and Kylie Cosmetics to give away 

'Joanna and Clea, they made a beautiful, functional space,' Khloe says

Easy! There is also a section with extra gifts that Khloe keeps in storage should she ever need a present for someone

Variety: She has some baby items like bows and shows, plus adult gifts like perfume

'Most of my house is pretty organized right now but I might mess some things up just to get them back,' Khloe says

Further along, more shelves hold extra household items in storage, including tissues, soap, diapers, wipes, disinfectant, and cleaners. 

Khloe's art station remains in the middle, but the easels have been flipped so Khloe can look outside while she paints. They've also added a cart for her art supplies. 

'Joanna and Clea, they made a beautiful, functional space,' Khloe says. 'I know where everything is but it's also visually appealing and everything is spaced out perfectly so I can find everything so perfectly. It's just perfect. 

'Most of my house is pretty organized right now but I might mess some things up just to get them back,' she adds.

'I should marry them. What am I waiting on?'

Star power: Reese Witherspoon, whose Hello Sunshine production company executive produced the show, also appears in the new season 

'This is my dream dream dream project that you guys would come and help me organize,' she tells them, while showing off her stunning home interior 

Empty: Eva Longoria welcomes them to her house in another episode this season

'They're the organizational gurus,' says Eva 

Joanna and Clea's The Home Edit organizing business is comprised of home visits, a product line, and a book — which have earned them 1.6 million Instagram followers and countless celebrity fans.

This season, Clea and Joanna also bring home makeovers to regular people as well as stars including Eva Longoria, Rachel Zoe, and Neil Patrick Harris. 

'Our intention for everything that we do is to give people all the tools to make a system smart, sustainable, and beautiful,' Joanna says in the trailer. 'Form plus function.'

'Labels are magic,' adds Clea. 'It's the key to maintenance.' 

Reese Witherspoon, whose Hello Sunshine production company executive produced the show, also welcomes the two women into her home.

'This is my dream dream dream project that you guys would come and help me organize,' she tells them in her episode.

The show will also include appearances from Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka, Jordana Brewster, and Kane and Katelyn Brown.

Molly Sims is also an executive producer, though it doesn't seem that the supermodel got her own home organized this season.

The show was announced by Netflix last month, and The Home Edit shared their excitement on Instagram. 

'We are SO proud of this show and can’t wait to share it with you!' they wrote. 

The Home Edit has grown in popularity on Instagram over the past few years, thanks to the droolworthy photos they post pantries and closets that have been perfect organized, with items divided into identical clear bins and cascading with color.

Several of their famous clients, including Gwyneth Paltrow, have also shared the results of their work. 

'One of the things we love most about having organized homes, and one of the things we often hear from our clients, is how calm they feel when everything’s put away. Organization can help save time, money, and ultimately, your sanity,' Joanna told Create & Cultivate.  

Other well-known customers include Mandy Moore, Abigail Spencer, Whitney Port, Olivia Culpo, Hoda Kotb, Kasey Musgraves, Jessie James Decker, Schitt's Creek star Dan Levy, Vanessa Lachey, and Tiffani Thiessen.

In 2018, they worked their magic on Busy Philipps' pantry and the actress stunned fans with the before-and-after pictures. 

'My kitchen and pantry looked insane and the lovely ladies at @thehomeedit came and changed my life (I mean, at least my snacks),' she wrote on Instagram.
