She has been on set the last few days filming a new campaign with Revlon. 

And Shay Mitchell looked fantastic in a chic take on a suit as she filmed in Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday. 

The Pretty Little Liars alum was spotted with a filming crew donning a white button-up top, worn partly buttoned and off the shoulder with statement-cut pants. 

Chic: Shay Mitchell looked fantastic in a chic take on a suit as she filmed in Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday 

Her white dress top was teamed with cream colored trousers, that cinched in her waist with a large band and flowed in a wide-leg cut. 

For some extra height added to her look, the actress wore open toe heels that swapped in and out for grey slippers when she wasn't filming. 

The 33-year-old's dark brown hair was parted in the middle and down in loose wavy style. 

She had full glam makeup done before going in front of the cameras with a flawless complexion, contoured cheekbones and bold brows.

Shay is a brand ambassador for the beauty giant and was spotted working with a filming crew on the streets on Wednesday.  

Shay has been enjoying an easy coronavirus lockdown. While she's been anchored in LA, the star has taken small trips to see her family in Canada since she gave birth to daughter Atlas just eight-months ago.

She shares her little one with partner Matte Babel. And while the pair are going strong the actress said that she's in no rush to walk down the aisle.

Talking to ET last month, she said: 'A lot of people ask, it's never been something I really cared for,' she said of the prospect of marriage.

'And I love weddings, love weddings. I can watch them all day long. I love attending, I love being a part of my friends' [weddings], anybody's to be quite honest.

'It's just not something I care for for myself and it's something that Matte and I have spoken about,' she explained.

Embrace: Shay beamed a bright smile as she hugged someone on the set 

The Dollface actress clarified that she was leading the way on delaying an engagement, though Matte didn't seem to mind.

'He's been like, 'You sure?' And I'm like, 'Yeah, we work so well right now.' It's great and this dynamic just works for us.

'It may not always be the correct way but it works. That's how I sort of have to go, you know, that's how I do it,' she added.

Taking her time: Shay revealed to ET that an engagement isn't on her mind at the moment. 'A lot of people ask, it's never been something I really cared for,' she said after welcoming her daughter Atlas eight-months ago with partner Matte Babel
