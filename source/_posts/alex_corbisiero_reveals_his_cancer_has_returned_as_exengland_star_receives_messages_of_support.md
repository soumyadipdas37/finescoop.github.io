Ex-England loosehead prop Alex Corbisiero has revealed that he is battling cancer once more after it returned.

Last November, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer - something he announced publicly in March.

Corbisiero, who also played for the Lions during his career, had seemingly been on the mend but sadly it has come back.

Corbisiero, who won 20 caps with England, took to social media to announce the sad news

Taking to social media on Monday, the 32-year-old wrote: 'When I opened up about my cancer experience in March, I was very hopeful it was behind me.

'Unfortunately, the doctors discovered that it has spread to some of my lymph nodes. I'm currently on week five of nine of chemotherapy under the amazing care of the staff at Guy's hospital in London.

'I'm mentally and physically in a good place and staying positive throughout this rollercoaster of ups and downs. I'm surrounded by my fiancee, family and close friends, and very grateful for all the love and support.

'I just want to remind everyone, despite Covid, please go and get checked! Time is of the essence and I'm very lucky to have caught this early again. In the words of my hero, @therock, "Just Bring It".'

The 32-year-old was part of the Lions' successful tour of Australia in 2013 and even scored a try

Corbisiero accompanied the caption alongside a picture of his fiancee Abby Gustaitis, and she too wrote her own tribute to her loved one.

'Unfortunately, we received the news that Alex must undergo chemotherapy to combat the cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes. It's been a wild ride so far, full of ups and downs. We are hopeful and grateful for the care and treatment he is receiving in London,' she posted on Instagram.

'Happy to stand by his side and support him as he has done for me in every aspect. We ask for you to keep him in your thoughts and send positive vibes our way. Thank you all for the love and support. Love you @alexcorbs.'

Support for Corbisiero has been felt throughout the rugby world following his latest news.

England tweeted: 'You've got this Corbs', while his former club Northampton Saints wrote: 'Sending our strength to @AlexCorbs as he faces another battle with cancer. Crush it like an opposition tight-head, Corbs.'

Former England captain and team-mate Chris Robshaw as well as Ireland and Lions legend Brian O'Driscoll are among the plethora of players who have also sent well-wishing messages to Corbisiero.

'Incredible strength! Keep going @AlexCorbs, sending you all of our support #ForOurPlayers #TeamCorbs,' wrote the Rugby Players Association.

Speaking in March, Corbisiero revealed he first noticed a problem in November while in America.

'I just felt something wasn't right. I could tell it felt a bit bigger, a bit harder, it was starting to get a little bit sore. I started to notice bumping into it. I had been keeping an eye on it for a couple of weeks and it felt like it was growing every day,' he told The Times.

'Finally when I had a break I went to get it checked. It was always on my radar slightly because my dad had testicular cancer when he was 28. I was still in denial.

'I was going to get this checked and then go to jiu-jitsu. My brother was waiting in the car. Next thing I had to call him and say: "Hey bro, I have got testicular cancer".

'The doctor said: "Very few people die from this". That was my initial thought: "I don't want to die". You are in shock and very emotional. You can't believe it all changed on that day and you are dealing with this.'

Corbisiero won 20 Test caps for England and played twice for the British and Irish Lions on their successful tour of Australia in 2013. He also won a league title with Northampton in 2014 before multiple injuries forced him to retire at the age of 27.
