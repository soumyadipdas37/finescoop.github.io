Michy Batshuayi has returned to Crystal Palace on loan after signing a contract extension with Chelsea.

Batshuayi joined Chelsea for £33million from Marseille in 2016 but has struggled for regular game time and been pushed further down the pecking order this summer following the Blues’ spending spree.

The £53m signing of Timo Werner, adding to Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud already in the squad, means Batshuayi would have been the fourth-choice striker in Frank Lampard's options.
