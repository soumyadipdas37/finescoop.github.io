She welcomed her first child, daughter Aurora, almost five months ago.

And on Wednesday, Amy Hembrow showed off her sensational post-baby body as she stripped down into some lingerie. 

The 30-year-old, who is the eldest sister of health and fitness mogul Tammy Hembrow, shared a photo of herself on Instagram and revealed that she's never felt 'more confident' in her own skin. 

One hot mama! On Wednesday, Tammy Hembrow's sister Amy flaunted her sensational post-baby body in lingerie as she revealed having a child has made her feel 'more confident' and 'comfortable' in her own skin

The blonde bombshell stripped down into a mocha colour lingerie set by Lounge Underwear that put her best assets on display.

Amy wore her long locks out and over her shoulders, neatly straightened. 

For makeup, she kept it simple with a fresh foundation base with a slight hint of blush on her cheeks and a subtle pink lip.

The Gold Coast-based businesswoman wrote in the caption: 'I don't think I've ever felt more comfortable in my own skin.'

'Crazy to think that before Aurora I was so self conscious but during my pregnancy I felt more confident every day, I think it's my new appreciation for my body and what it's gone through,' she added.

Amy and her fiancé, Rory Carmody, welcomed Aurora on April 14.

In an Instagram post at the time, she shared her water birthing experience and said she had always wanted to stay at home for as long as possible before going to the hospital.

'I laboured at home from 1am until 7am, and then that's when my midwife said that I should come in [to the hospital].'

Amy said she 'chose not to know' how dilated she was during the labour, because she didn't want to get 'disheartened' if she still had a long way to go. 

Almost there: Amy was in the bath for just two hours before her daughter was born. In the room with her was her fiancé Rory and her younger sister Starlette Thynne

She was in the shower when she 'transitioned into the final stretch' of her labour, and was then 'asked to get into the water bath', where she listened to a playlist of Nick Cave songs and positive affirmations.

Amy was in the bath for just two hours before her daughter was born. In the room with her was her fiancé Rory and her younger sister Starlette Thynne.

Mother and daughter returned home later that day after their health check-ups.
