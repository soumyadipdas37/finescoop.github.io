Martha Kalifatidis and Michael Brunelli are one of the few success stories to come out of Channel Nine's disastrous Married At First Sight.

But it hasn't always been smooth sailing for the reality TV power couple, who secretly split for a few hours recently before getting back together.

During an appearance on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday, Martha was asked by host Kyle Sandilands if she and Michael had ever broken up before.

'For like a few hours,' the 31-year-old admitted, before admitting that they didn't even spend any time apart during the split because they were still stuck in the same house together.

Earlier this year, the former Married At First Sight stars shared a number of text messages to their Instagram accounts which appeared to indicate they had split. 

However, it was later revealed to be a publicity stunt to promote her new internet service provider.

'Me and Michael have not broken up,' Martha said on Instagram at the time.

'We are actually really happy together. But we have broken up with our telco provider!' 

Martha then launched into a lengthy spiel spruiking Circles Life Australia and their data plan.

Rather than being angry over the con, the majority of the pair's fans appeared very relieved they had not split, with numerous comments praising the prank. 

Earlier this year, the couple moved in together in Sydney's trendy Bondi.

Michael currently runs his own online fitness program, while Martha is one of Sydney's most successful Instagram influencers.
