The auburn-haired beauty has been happily single since splitting with Luke Mabbott. 

Back in June, the TV star broke her silence on her split from Luke, 25, four months after they finished in third place on the first-ever winter edition of Love Island. 

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Demi confirmed the pair officially called it quits in May, a decision she claims was encouraged by the heating engineer, 25.

She admitted that while 'there's no bad blood' between the former couple, she doesn't believe they'll rekindle their romance in the future.

In January, the auburn beauty entered the Cape Town villa as a bombshell, initially embarking on a romance with Nas Majeed.

But once the hopefuls were put to the test with a trip to Casa Amor, Demi was left heartbroken when she discovered her love interest returned with Eva Zapico.
