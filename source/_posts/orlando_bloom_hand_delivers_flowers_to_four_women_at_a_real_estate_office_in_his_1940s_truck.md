He's been revelling in the joys of fatherhood, after welcoming a daughter called Daisy with his fiancée Katy Perry last month.

And Orlando Bloom spread the happiness further afield on Thursday, when he hand delivered flowers to four women at a real estate office in Santa Barbara, California.

The Pirates Of The Caribbean star arrived at the offices in his classic cyan 1940s Ford pickup truck, where he was later seen loading two hydrofoil surfboards.

Donning a patterned face mask, the British screen star was surrounded by the ladies holding their colourful bouquets as they watched him load up his truck.

The Canterbury native looked casually cool for the outing in his wife-to-be's hometown, stepping out in a black T-shirt with black-and-grey shorts.

He was hard to miss as he drove off in his gleaming classic cyan vehicle, which boasted bright yellow hubcaps.

Two days earlier, the actor was seen meeting up with Katy's father, Keith Hudson, in Los Angeles, ahead of making their journey north to Santa Barbara. 

British actor Orlando and pop star Katy introduced their bundle of joy to the world on August 26 via Unicef, for whom they serve as Goodwill Ambassadors. 

The humanitarian agency released a statement on their behalf, which read: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter.

'But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.'

The couple also shared a sweet black and white photo of them clasping their baby's tiny hand.

Orlando and the singer–songwriter have been together since January 2016, but their love story was temporarily paused when they split in February 2017.

However, the two worked out their differences and reunited a year later, and the two got engaged on Valentine's Day 2019.

The couple revealed they were expecting their first child in March of this year, shortly before much of the US shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On Sunday, Katy revealed on Instagram that her one-time nemesis Taylor Swift had sent her a hand-embroidered blanket for her daughter.

Miss [Daisy] adores her hand embroidered blankie from miss @taylorswift,' she wrote. 'hope it’s one she drags around for years till it becomes an unrecognizable shred that she keeps in her pocket as a teenager ♥️.'

Last year, it was revealed that the Teenage Dream singer had ended her feud with Taylor when she appeared in the former country singer's video for You Need To Calm Down.

Second time around: Orlando and Katy, 35, began dating in 2016, before separating in early 2017. They reunited a year later and got engaged on Valentine's Day 2019; shown in 2016
