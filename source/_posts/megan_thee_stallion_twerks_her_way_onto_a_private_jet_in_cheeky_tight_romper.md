The Texas-native looked fantastic in the grey one-piece outfit, that was linked with a white hem and collar. 

She added some designer accessories, as she carried a grey and white large Louis Vuitton on her shoulder.

Despite the recent success of WAP, which became the first female rap collaboration to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, along with other records Megan has been having a summer of unfortunate drama. 

Megan broke her silence earlier this month to publicly name Tory Lanez as the man who shot her, having previously remained mum about the alleged culprit, since being shot back in July.

Before she made her accusation Tory had already been charged for having had a concealed weapon at the time of the incident. 

'Since you're all so worried about it, yes, this n**** Tory shot me,' she said while going Live on Instagram this Thursday.

'You shot me and you got got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and s**t. Stop lying. Why lie.'

Megan asserted that she did not tell cops the full story on the night of the incident because they were 'aggressive' and she 'didn't want the police to shoot me.' 

Tory allegedly shot her in both feet in the small hours of the morning on July 12 outside a party in the Hollywood Hills.

Megan was attempting to exit the SUV she and Tory were in only for him to reportedly fire his gun, according to TMZ.
