The landlord of New York socialite Libbie Mugrabi wants to evict her from his luxury $30,000-a-month Yorkville condo in a spat over back rent and utilities.

The owner of the Park Mansion on East 82nd Street says Libbie, 40, who recently settled a bitter divorce from billionaire art collector David Mugrabi, owes at least $148,450 from April.

The star, whose ex's family had the world's largest collection of Andy Warhol artworks, has been behind on her $28,800 rent plus utilities for months, allege papers filed in Manhattan civil court as seen by PageSix.

A source close to Libbie, who recently finalised an acrimonious divorce that was branded New York City's 'nastiest' split, said her ex-husband stopped paying her bills.

It is not known if David, 48, who shares two children with Libbie, was required to pay the rent since he filed for divorce in 2018.

The source said: 'The rent has not been paid. No one disputes this. 

'But thanks to Gov. Cuomo, there's also a government moratorium on evictions that plays into this.'

In August, the couple settled their divorce after Libbie demanded $100million, according to Avenue.

The pair were fighting over a $72million Manhattan townhouse, his family's art collection estimated to be worth $5billion and their Hamptons home. 

Libbie is now said to be dating former Mighty Ducks actor turned blockchain entrepreneur and independent presidential candidate Brock Pierce.

She previously accused a houseguest of sleeping with her husband after the woman, David, and five other guests went skinny-dipping in the pool following a dinner party on the Fourth of July weekend in 2018.

She claimed she walked in at 6am the next morning to find her husband lying naked and asleep on top of an attractive brunette beneath a painting from Richard Prince's 'After Dark' series.

The houseguest, who has not been named but knew the Mugrabis from the world of art, said: 'It was fun. It was nothing sexual. As if we were teenagers.'

Libbie also accused David of physically assaulting her when he caught her trying to move a $500,000 Keith Haring sculpture out of their home.

At one point in court, proceedings became so heated that Libbie's attorney shouted at David: 'Cuff him and take him down to The Tombs!' 

A source said after the divorce was settled: 'She asked for a hundred million, and she's happy with the deal she got.

'It includes art, real estate, alimony and child support. All the goodies.'
