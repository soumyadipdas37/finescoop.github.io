'The 2019 Emmys were full of glitz and glamour, but as far as the Internet was concerned, there was one image that stole the show,' Swift said. 

'The picture in question launched thousands of tweets, ranging from 'Phoebe Waller-Bridge at the Emmy's after party is a big fat mood,' to 'My vision board is just this photo 500 times' and the popular 'THE POWER SHE HOLDS.'

'It depicts Phoebe, mid-puff-of-smoke, blissfully relaxing on a sun lounger in a glittery Monique Lhuillier gown, surrounded by Emmys. It was, to paraphrase pretty much everyone who saw it, iconic.

In her note, Swift showed her appreciation for Waller-Bridge's dedication to her craft, as she's also penned shows such as Killing Eve and Crashing.

'The reason this picture feels so good to see is that before this moment, there were seemingly endless drafts and rewrites and deadlines,' Swift wrote. 

'There were countless times this writer was up at all hours of the night, not celebrating in the delicious glow of the light bouncing off her golden trophies, but racking her brain to try and stick a literary landing.'

She hailed Waller-Bridge's ascent in the industry with projects including Killing Eve, Fleabag and No Time to Die, the James Bond script she penned.

'Sometimes all the puzzle pieces fall into place at the perfect time,' Swift wrote. 'A combination of razor-sharp instincts, killer wit and genuine care for the people she works with proved to be a winning hand.'

The singer and songwriter said that 'it's magical to see that all the rehearsals, baby steps, false starts and dead ends can lead to an extremely driven and unfathomably talented woman unwinding in a lounge chair surrounded by her winnings,' adding, 'Phoebe Waller-Bridge and all that she has achieved is, indeed, a big mood.'
