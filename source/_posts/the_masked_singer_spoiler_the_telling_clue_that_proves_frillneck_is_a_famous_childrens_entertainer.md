As the competition heats up on The Masked Singer, the likes of Eddie Perfect and Tim Minchin have all been suggested as possible candidates for Frillneck. 

But fans are now convinced the celebrity under the costume is none other than Australian children's entertainer Jimmy Rees, better known as 'Jimmy Giggle'. 

The telling clue he's a 'stand-up guy who hangs with birds of a feather' could also refer the the 33-year-old's former on-screen pet owl, Hoot.

Other clues to Frillneck's identity include he's 'theatrical and comfortable putting on a show' and 'Jack Black and I were fascinated with the same incredible creature'.  

On Wednesday, Frillneck divided viewers when he performed the chart-topping hit Can't Hold Us by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. 

Several fans watching from home said the song was '100% Jimmy Giggle' while others were convinced it was comedian Eddie Perfect.  

During the episode, judge Jackie 'O' Henderson also suggest Frillneck could be a children's entertainer.

It's also worth noting The Masked Singer's official account also follows Jimmy Rees.

On Thursday, Daily Mail Australia reached out to Jimmy for comment. The star refused to confirm or deny if he was on the show. 

Jimmy debuted as 'Jimmy Giggle' back in 2009 and served on the long-running children's ABC series for a decade. He departed the series last year. 

Telling clue? It comes as no surprise The Masked Singer's official account follows the star

'After 10 years I decided that it was time to take on the next exciting challenge in my career, while also being able to dedicate more time to performing as Jimmy Giggle live in concert, a part of the job I love so much,' he said at the time.

Jimmy is a proud father to three young sons - Lenny and twins, Vinny and Mack - with wife Tori Rees.

He appeared on last year's season of Dancing With The Stars, but had to quit when his then-seven-week-old son suffered complications during a procedure to correct his tongue-tie. 

A tongue-tie occurs when the string of tissue under the tongue stops it from moving well.
