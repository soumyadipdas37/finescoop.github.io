Samantha Cameron volunteered for Smart Works when she was in Downing Street, doing interview training. She said in a statement. 'The work they do is so valuable and it is an extremely targeted, efficient and effective charity. 

'I am now an ambassador for Smart Works and am always delighted to do anything to support and help them, whether by donating one of my dresses for this auction, or stock from [my fashion brand] Cefinn to dress the charity's clients.' 

Kate Stephens, CEO of Smart Works, said: 'Passing on a treasured possession to help another woman succeed is a powerful concept and one we passionately believe in at Smart Works. 

'All proceeds from the incredible pieces in this auction will help give women across the UK the toolkit they need to transform their lives. As we navigate this pandemic, we know more women than ever before will need our support and it’s been wonderful to see our community come together to help us during this time. 

'We’re thankful to those who have so generously donated their cherished items for this cause, and to Stella and Christie’s for making this concept a reality, so we can carry on providing support to those who need it most.'
