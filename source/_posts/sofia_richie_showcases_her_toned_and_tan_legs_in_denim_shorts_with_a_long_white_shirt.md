She has been enjoying summer beach side in Malibu since splitting from Scott Disick, earlier this year. 

But Sofia Richie enjoyed an afternoon in West Hollywood on Thursday, as she showcased her fashionable sense of style. 

The 22-year-old model flaunted her toned and tan legs in denim cut-off shorts that she teamed with a long and flowing white button-up shirt.

The daughter of Lionel Richie kept her look light as she added white lace-up sneakers. 

She carried a black and gold Fendi handbag and her pink cased iPhone as she walked down the street. 

Most of her famous face was covered in thin oval shaped dark sunglasses and a pink patterned reusable face mask, amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Her oversized white shirt was only secured closed by two buttons at her chest, and flowed open at the bottom.

The top hun low, even covering her shorts, making it look like a dress at points. 

Sofia tied her golden blonde hair back in claw clip, as it was parted in the middle and kept off her neck. 

For extra touches, she added layered gold necklaces under her top and small gold hoop earrings.  

Earlier in the week on Tuesday, Sofia took to social media to promote National Voter Registration Day.

She wore a grey T-shirt simply reading 'VOTE' that she tucked into black denim jeans.  

'Happy national voter registration day,' she wrote. 'THE REAL POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS… VOTE! Please register.'

Though her post was non-partisan, the comments were quickly inundated with nearly identical posts saying, 'Trump 2020,' and she went on to disable the comments section. 

The ex-girlfriend of Scott Disick also posted links to multiple organizations that help voters register in her Instagram Stories. 

New year: Sofia posted last week in honor of Rosh Hashanah, prompting a comment from her ex Scott Disick 

Blessings: Scott commented 'Shanah tovah umetukah,' which means 'have a good year.'

She recently split from Scott, 37, 'for good,' after three years of dating.  

The TV star and Sofia ended their turbulent romance earlier this summer, and they are now no longer on speaking terms after 'Scott officially called it off.' 

An E! News insider claimed that their age difference and different lifestyles, as Scott has three children, ultimately became an issue for the celebrity duo. 

Despite reports that the former couple is 'no longer speaking,' when Sofia posted last week in honor of Rosh Hashanah, the Keeping Up With the Kardashian's star commented 'Shanah tovah umetukah,' which means 'have a good year.'
