Last Saturday, Dame Jane Seymour flaunted her impressively fit 5ft3in figure in a post celebrating National Day of Encouragement, which is dedicated to uplifting people and making a positive impact.

The British mother-of-four - who doesn't retouch any of her photos - easily defied her 69 years in a black sports bra and matching leggings while posing on the steps of her Malibu home garden.

'In case nobody has told you recently, I am proud of you!' Seymour wrote to her 602K Instagram/Facebook followers.

'We are collectively experiencing these difficult times but you are overcoming obstacles day by day. Share some encouragement with the people in your life and tag them below!'

On Sunday, Jane (born Joyce Frankenberg) she shared a video of herself perching at the top of the waterfall flowing into her coy pond, and reminded her fans of the importance of self-care.

'From taking a relaxing bath to cooking your favorite meal, self-care means something different for everyone,' The Kominsky Method actress explained.

'I truly enjoy the comforting sounds of waves and running water. Take a moment to think of small things you can do to nurture your soul. What are some ways you practice self-care?'

Seymour exercises twice a week for 20 minutes by practicing Pilates, Gyrotonics, and something called The Perfect Workout.

'It's very, very slow weightlifting,' Jane described to Closer Weekly on February 16.

'I notice a huge difference when I do it. Each exercise you do, you do it to fatigue so your whole body starts shaking...I do my best, but I'm not trying to be younger than who I am. I'm just trying to be the best I can be at the age I'm at.'

'Mostly I eat chicken, a lot of vegetables': As for diet, Seymour believes in 'everything in moderation' which 'of course, is the hardest thing' (pictured August 22)

As for diet, the two-time Golden Globe winner believes in 'everything in moderation' which 'of course, is the hardest thing.'

'Me telling myself I'm on a diet never works. Me saying, "Okay, I'm going to have a bite of this cake but I don't need the whole cake" - that's how it works,' Seymour stated.

'I don't eat too much starch, I try not to. Mostly I eat chicken, a lot of vegetables. We grow a lot of vegetables in the garden, organically.'
