She's the ambassador for Pretty Little Thing.

And Sophia Richie looked like a 10 while modeling one the brand's sultry looks on Saturday.

The stunning daughter of Lionel  Richie, 22, showed off her chiseled abs and stellar style in an outfit shot, which she captioned: 'Beige baby.'

Sofia was the epitome of elegance as she leaned upon a beam in her dad's stunning yard.

The second generation stunner proved her fashion prowess in a nude jacket, tube top and matching high-waisted pants.

She covered her face with dark sunglasses while raking her hair up into a high ponytail for some sass.

Sofia didn't look worried about her ex Scott Disick during her glam photoshoot.

Happy it's over: Caitlyn Jenner said she would love to see Kourtney Kardashian rekindle her romance with Sofia's ex Scott Disick: 'I would hope [Scott] can kinda get his act together. They've got all these kids together'

And it seems like Disick's extended family is hoping both move on from the May-December relationship.

Caitlyn Jenner recently admitted she'd love to see stepdaughter Kourtney Kardashian rekindle her romance with Scott.

The 70-year-old reality star has said she's keen to see her former step-daughter get back together with her ex-boyfriend Scott following their 2015 split, because she believes it would 'best' for their children - Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five - to have 'a mother and a father that's right there all the time'. 

She said: 'I would hope [Scott] can kinda get his act together. They've got all these kids together. I think always it's the best for the kids to have a mother and a father that's right there all the time. I don't know if that's ever gonna work out.'

However, Caitlyn also noted that several of her kids - including Kylie Jenner and Brandon Jenner - have split from their partners after welcoming children together, so ultimately believes it's up to Kourtney to decide if she wants Scott back. 

The I Am Cait star told Entertainment Tonight: 'So many of [my kids] had never gotten married, but had families and all the kids seem to be doing great. They're just great kids. 

'Kourtney and Scott are both good parents. Whether they work it out themselves for a lasting relationship, I don't know. That's a Kourtney question.'

Caitlyn's comments come after Kourtney, 41, has been seemingly getting closer to Scott, 37, since he split from Sofia Richie in May. 

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians stars were spotted having sushi together last month, but sources later said they were simply meeting up to discuss the co-parenting of their three children. 

It comes after a source claimed Scott and Sofia's relationship status 'changes daily', with Scott spending an increasing amount of time with ex Kourtney. 

A source shared: 'Things haven't been great between them. Scott's been spending every day with Kourtney and the kids and has been vacationing with her. 

'Things are always tense between Scott and Sofia when he goes away without her ... They are still in contact and have seen each other multiple times in the last month, but are not as inseparable as before.' 

'Kourtney and Scott are both good parents. Whether they work it out themselves for a lasting relationship, I don't know. That's a Kourtney question.' Caitlyn added
