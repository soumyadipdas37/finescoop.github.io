Premier Daniel Andrews has finally admitted it was his decision to introduce Melbourne's curfew, after Victoria's chief health officer revealed he wasn't responsible for the draconian measure.  

Under some of the toughest coronavirus restrictions in the world, five million Melburnians are not allowed out of their homes between 8pm and 5am.

On Tuesday, Professor Brett Sutton revealed medical experts did not request the curfew but it was brought in as the state government declared a state of disaster on August 2.   

'The curfew came in as part of the state of disaster... it wasn't a state of emergency requirement,' Professor Sutton told Melbourne radio station 3AW.

'It wasn't something that I was against from a public health perspective. 

'I was consulted on it but it was a separate decision-making pathway.'

Mr Andrews was pressed on Melbourne's curfew during his daily coronavirus update on Wednesday.

The premier initially said he was unable to identify the person responsible for the restriction, before buckling to pressure. 

'I can't pinpoint the individual and the day, I can't give you a specific person,' he said, adding the curfew 'makes the job of police much easier'.

 'If you want to go out and be unlawful now police have got the easiest set of arrangements they have ever had to catch you and fine you. That's what a curfew delivers.'

Following further grilling, Mr Andrews said it was his choice to implement the curfew. 

'It's consistent with the health advice,' he said.

'These are decisions ultimately made by me, so the answer to the question (of why there is a curfew) is, I've made that decision. It's a challenging one to make, but it's effective.'

From 11.59pm on September 13, Melbourne's curfew will be eased to 9pm to 5am.

Professor Sutton was also asked for his personal opinion on the effectiveness of the curfew during Tuesday's interview.  

'I haven't reflected on it, I think it has been useful. If I put my mind to it, probably,' he said.  

Professor Sutton denied any rumours that he had fallen out with Mr Andrews and said: 'We've worked very well together.'

'I get along pretty well with all sorts hopefully across the political spectrum and across all the various personality types,' he said.

'My gig is to provide straight up robust advice.

'I'm pretty comfortable with giving it, maybe when it's not comfortably received.'  

Under Mr Andrews' road map to easing restrictions, released on Sunday, lockdown will only end when there are an average of five cases per day, which is not expected in Melbourne until October 26. 

Until then, a curfew will be in place from 9pm to 5am and residents can only leave home for exercise, shopping, school and work, and caregiving.  

Step one: The first step will come in to place on September 13.

Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. 

Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.

Step four: The move to step four will come when there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on November 23.
