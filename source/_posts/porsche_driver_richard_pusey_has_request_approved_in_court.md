A Porsche driver accused of videoing four police officers who were fatally struck by a truck has been granted access to his medical records to support his case. 

Richard Pusey has been charged with a raft of offences following the deadly collision on the Eastern Freeway in Kew, Melbourne, on April 22.

Police had pulled over the 42-year-old after he was allegedly clocked doing 149km/h while under the influence of methamphetamine and cannabis. 

Richard Pusey, the driver of a Porsche who allegedly fled the scene of a truck crash on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway which killed four police officers, is taken away from his Fitzroy property by police on April 23

The four police officers were hit by a semi-trailer while they were dealing with Pusey, who then allegedly filmed the crash site and verbally abused Senior Constable Taylor, who was dying, before fleeing. 

'Now you have f**ked my f**king car,' Pusey was allegedly heard to say. 

On Thursday, Pusey sought access to his medical records and a witness summons, NCA NewsWire reported.

The businessman did not appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court.

Pusey (pictured) is facing more than a dozen charges 

Magistrate Donna Bakos granted Pusey's lawyer Chris McLennan access to 177 pages of medical documents, but some additional pages were not included because they could 'identify others'. 

The details of the documents were not disclosed to the court and prosecutor Jason Ong did not ask for access.   

Pusey is facing more than a dozen charges including driving at a dangerous speed, reckless conduct endangering life, destruction of evidence, perverting the course of justice, failing to remain at the scene after a drug test and failing to render assistance.

Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Constable Glen Humphris, Senior Constable Kevin King and Constable Josh Prestney were all killed in the crash. 

Pusey is expected to face court next month.
