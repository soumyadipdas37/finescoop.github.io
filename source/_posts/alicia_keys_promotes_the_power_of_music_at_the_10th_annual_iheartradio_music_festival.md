Alicia Keys was all about spreading the word of love and hope through music when she took the stage for day one of the 10th Annual iHeartRadio Music Festival. 

And with the COVID-19 pandemic still raging, the performances took place on stages in Los Angeles and Nashville, in front of a virtual audience.

Keys kicked off the weekend festivities by pronouncing: '2020 has been something, and nothing is the same, is it? But you know what I call it? I call it The Great Transformation. One thing that's true, you can never stop the music. We need it now more than ever.'

She's back! Alicia Keys performed at day one of the 10th Annual iHeartRadio Music Festival

The 15-time Grammy Award-winning musician and songwriter serenaded the remote audience by performing the songs Love Looks Better and So Done off of her newly-released self-titled album, Alicia.

Sitting at her piano, while soaked in a blue light, the New York City native stunned in a chic skintight black ensemble with a jeweled cutout over the shoulder.

She also had her long braided tresses pulled back off her face and tied into jewels.

In the lead-in to Love Looks Better, Keys talked about how the song is perfect for the post-coronavirus world we're living during these past seven months.

'It really talks about how busy we've all been. We've been all consumed with everything else,' she explained while glowing under the stage lights, as reported by iHeartRadio.

'But then you realize, "Wait a minute, the people I love the most, the people I want to spend the most time with ... maybe I've been spending all my time in all these other places, and actually, my love looks better on you."' 

Keys performed at the first-ever iHeartRadio Music Festival in 2011, which she proudly pronounced during her time in the spotlight. 

'I was here for the very first iHeart Festival, and I'm here right now better than ever,' she said from the LA stage.
