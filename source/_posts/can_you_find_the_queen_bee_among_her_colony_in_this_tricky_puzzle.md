A tricky new brainteaser is challenging players to find a single queen bee hiding within her busy colony.

Hungarian children's illustrator and viral puzzle sensation Gergely Dudás, better known as Dudolf, recently shared the seek-and-find puzzle on his website and Facebook page for fans to enjoy.

Players are asked to spot the single queen bee in the hectic scene and, to throw people off and make things as difficult as possible, all the insects look frustratingly similar.

The cartoonist also filled the vibrant image with plenty of playful characters, brightly coloured accessories and extra details to try to confuse the eye.

If you're struggling to find the answer, then here's a clue - feast your eyes towards the bottom right-hand side of the busy image. 

Give up? Scroll down to find the well-hidden queen bee highlighted.

Earlier this year, Dudolf shared a tricky spot the difference puzzle which left even the most eagle-eyed players scratching their heads. 

He challenged puzzlers to find the seven things separating these two almost identical beach scenes.  

To have any hope of getting all seven, you will have to pay close attention to even the smallest of objects.

The puzzle, shared on Dudolf's Facebook and website, proved popular with his fans, who agreed it was 'seriously difficult' but 'fun'. 

One posted: 'Found five! Then I needed the solution'. Another wrote: 'Couldn't find the last one, but finally did.' A third asked: 'Did everyone have as much difficulty as I did?' 

If you're struggling to find them then here's a clue: the differences may be as small as a change in logo or a detail on an item of clothing.

Still having a hard time? You'll find the solutions below. 



Answers: The logo on the suncream, the fruit on the ground, the direction of the seashell swirl, the watermelon seeds, the band on a sunhat, the colours on an ice lolly, the sandcastle flag

It came just weeks after Dudolf challenged players to find the snake hiding in a jungle-themed seek-and-find puzzle.

The brainteaser shows a jungle scene in shades of green, with birds flitting between branches and thick foliage in the background. 

But the single slithering snake is almost impossible to find. 

The brainteaser, created by children's illustrator Gergely Dudás, from Budapest, Hungary, shows a mass of green and yellow leaves with misleading parrots 

The challenging graphic, produced by the illustrator of Fox & Rabbit, prompted fans of Dudolf's work to say it is 'very difficult'. 

If you're looking for a place to start, begin by working from left to right and look closely between the leaves to see if anything is hiding.

Try not to be put off by the vine leaves and parrots as you weave you way through the jungle to find the snake. 

And if you are still struggling, try looking closely at the patterns on the leaves to spot the creature. 

Give up? Then scroll down to find the answer highlighted among the faded jungle scene.
