She is one of Australia's most well-known comedians and radio personalities.

And earlier this year the 41-year-old launched her own podcast after she sensationally quit her radio gig at 2Day FM.  

In addition, she is also a doting mother-of-three - but would you recognise her from this throwback photo taken when she was in High School? 

Guess who! This Australian comedian and radio presenter isn't afraid to tell it like it is - but would you recognise her from this throwback school photo

In the picture, she is sporting a blue and white striped school uniform and her brown locks are worn loose in a shoulder length bob.  

The young teen in the photo is none other than media personality, Em Rusciano.  

Plugging this week's episode of her podcast, Emsolation which will focus on the struggles of puberty, Em opened up about her own as she captioned the photo: 'High School was hell on wheels for me.'

'I just remember feeling overwhelming shame, all the time about everything. My body would go rogue at the most inopportune times, I woke up on this day, school photo day, with THREE cold sores! I was hairy, I was sweaty, and I was super sensitive to EVERYTHING,' she added. 

Em left her 2Day FM job two years ago amid rumours of 'diva behaviour' and disputes with management. 

In April, she admitted on Wil Anderson's WILOSOPHY podcast that her behaviour on radio was 'pretty appalling' but she will 'never' return to radio.

Em confessed that when she's confronted with stressful situations, she has a tendency to 'go into fight mode'.

'Fists are up, and you're either, get in or get out of the way, and my behaviour was pretty appalling in radio,' she explained.

'Every time I've stepped into radio, my behaviour deteriorates and it's appalling, and I know that, and that's why I will never step back into radio, because I hate the person I become.'
