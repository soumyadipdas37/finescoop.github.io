Denise Welch broke down in tears as she revealed she's taking a break from social media in an Instagram clip shared on Wednesday after facing backlash from Piers Morgan for her thoughts on coronavirus 'scaremongering'.

The Loose Women panellist, 62, insisted she's 'trying to find a balance' between both negative and reassuring updates on the virus after the Good Morning Britain host, 55, branded her a 'dumb, deluded & dangerous Covid-denier.'

Actress Denise later tweeted about signing off online platforms to protect her mental health as she said: 'I’m going to be stepping back from here as it’s taking its toll. I will try and do my bit to balance the terror campaign and thank you for all your support.'

In the clip, the media personality attempted to clarify her comments from her heated discussion on This Morning last week, where she claimed the government are frightening people about the pandemic.

The former Coronation Street star grew emotional as she said: 'I seem to spend most of my days at the moment being quite emotional.

'I've been accused of not caring and being a Covid-denier when in fact I care so much about the devastation that Covid is causing, to the people who have lost their lives directly to Covid and those who are losing their lives because of Covid. 

'All I have tried to do is find a balance between the five months of scaremongering, fear inducing, morning wakening anxiety that is causing illness mental and physical.'

Hitting out: The outspoken GMB host criticised Denise's remarks in a bold tweet as she claimed the government are scaring people with their overreaction to infection numbers

Insisting she's shared 'balanced' reports about the virus on her accounts, Denise added: 'I have just tried to balance we all going to die, with we are not all going to die. 

'If I find out that hospital had no Covid for weeks, I'd broadcast that, and when I found out that 52 people were on ventiators opposed to 2,800 people at the peak of this pandemic, I'd post that.

'If we did hit a second wave, people would know that things have come on massively in that time. We're not where we were in March. If people are hospitalised which God forbid could lead to more deaths, it's the fact that doctors have told me that they now prone the patients instead of putting them on ventilators.'

The TV star went on to highlight the progressive steps researchers have taken to reduce the COVID-19 death rates.

'Depression has doubled, it's so destructive': Denise held back tears as she ended her post by confirming she's taking a step back from social media

Presenter Denise said: 'We now have three steroids that are incredibly effective which are decreasing mortality in many severe patients. We are at a better stand point than we were to deal with whatever happens. That's all I've tried to do.'

On how the news has affected her mental state, the thespian explained: 'Five months of turning on the TV has been so destructive to people's health and mental health turns into physical health issues. 

'The charities I worked for had all their finding cut so they can't continue with their research. Depression has doubled, anorexia has doubled. Cancer diagnoses are way way down, so I'm just trying to find a balance.'

She held back tears as she ended her post by confirming she's taking a step back from social media.

The mother-of-two said: 'I won't be able to keep on doing it because it's going to have an adverse effect on my and my family.

'To those people to say things like Covid-denier - that is the worst thing you can say to someone who has done nothing but try to alleviate the fear.'

Last week, outspoken Piers has criticised Denise's remarks as she claimed the government are scaring people with their overreaction to infection numbers. 

The journalist wrote on Twitter: 'Dumb, deluded & dangerous Covid-deniers like Denise Welch need to stop being given airtime. 

Heated: During her recent interview on the ITV daytime programme, she was told to 'calm down'' by host Eamonn Holmes, 60

'Her idiotic, ill-informed ramblings - from a woman who never stops telling us that she suffers from mental illness - will cost lives by persuading people to think the virus isn't a threat.' 

During her recent interview on the ITV daytime programme, she was told to 'calm down'' by host Eamonn Holmes, 60.

Appearing via video link from Portugal, the Waterloo Road star stated: 'I've never felt so passionate about anything in my life. I'm not saying this is over. I'm not saying how horrendous this virus is and was.

'But at the moment we have a one in two million chance of dying of Covid and I have a one in three chance of getting cancer. So can the government please tell us the proper statistics?'

The debate, which also featured Dr Sara Kayat, saw Denise also talk about people's mental health and the fact that people who suffer from the likes of cancer and heart disease were failing to receive the treatment they needed. 

Turning to Dr Sara for her opinion, Eamonn said of Denise: 'She's not extremely right-wing on all of this.'

To which the CBB star immediately snapped: 'Extremely right-wing? I'm not remotely right-wing, Eamonn.'

With Denise's passion clearly showing through, Eamonn interjected: 'I'm only using your quote back at you, right? Just calm down, right?' 

During the debate, the former soap star also criticised media coverage of positive coronavirus news as she questioned why days when 'nobody dies of a corona-related illness' is not reported.

As Eamonn suggested that some of Denise's views may cause panic amongst viewers, she retorted: 'How am I causing panic, Eamonn?!' 

The debate also saw Ruth Langsford's Loose Women co-star take aim at fellow ITV presenter Piers, as she fumed: 'I'm a T-list celebrity according to megastar Piers Morgan.'  

Denise did garner the support of several This Morning viewers, who firmly agreed with her points.  







Support: While Piers didn't agree with Denise's opinions, she did garner the support of several This Morning viewers, who firmly agreed with her points

Taking to Twitter, one viewer shared: 'Can't believe I'm about to say this but I actually agree with Denise Welch on #ThisMorning.' 

While another tweeted: 'Well said denise! Also need to get doctors back seeing people to catch all the undiagnosed illnesses.'

A third remarked: 'Well done Denise!!!!! She needs a question time event with government!! #ThisMorning.' 

Another added: 'Denise you go girl! You are so right! Government are obsessed and the media are scare mongering.  

'We need to try and get back to some kind of normal especially the Aviation industry!' 

Some viewers tuning in didn't agree with her delivery, with many complaining she was 'shouting' too much. 

One viewer observed: 'On a more serious note, Denise Welch may have some very good points, but they are completely lost in the way in which she is putting them across.'

While another fumed: 'Coming across as very RUDE. Why shout and rave at eamon and ruth. Its not there fault denise ffs.'

A third wrote: 'I'd just like to be told stuff like this from people like @RealDeniseWelch in a calm way.'
