Spencer Matthews has revealed he asked Lewis Capaldi to perform at his wedding to Vogue Williams - but got snubbed. 

The couple wed in an intimate ceremony in Scotland back in 2018, but threw a second lavish ceremony for their friends and family last year. 

Their London nuptials were attended by a host of celebrity guests, with a troupe of drag queens enlisted for the entertainment, but Spencer had hoped that Lewis would also make an appearance.

Speaking on the Spencer & Vogue podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star, 32, confessed that he reached out to the superstar singer on social media, much to the horror of his wife.  

Vogue, 34, mused: 'Lewis Capaldi, who is very funny on Instagram, very funny, how could you even think he was going to respond to you?' adding that the thought was 'mortifying'. 

As she mocked Spencer for being 'upset' that Lewis didn't respond, Spencer scoffed: 'I couldn’t care less!'

As he explained, 'I wanted him to sing at our wedding party, that’s what it was', Vogue interjected: 'Oh that’s all! 

'"Hey Lewis I know you haven’t got much on, would you mind, popping down to London to sing at my wedding party!"'

Reciting the message he sent, Spencer began: 'I said “Hi Lewis, how you getting on. My wife and I are fans of yours, can we discuss you…”' but Vogue couldn't hide her embarrassment as she exclaimed: 'Oh my god what were you thinking!   

'Lewis Capaldi is quite busy performing at Glastonbury and things like that, he’s not going to come and perform at our wedding party.'  

Spencer and Vogue tied the knot again back in September during a riverside ceremony in London, which was filmed for their E4 reality show Spencer, Vogue and Wedding Two.

Their second wedding was filled with thoughtful touches for their guests including an energetic drag queen act, a towering Maitre Choux pièce montée [eclair cake] and a very grand arrival on a speed boat.

Their sweet ceremony was ordained by Spencer's best pal and Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing, who gushed over the couple and told them that they are 'what true love looks like' as he welcomed guests to the wedding.

Along with Jamie, other celeb guests included Spencer's best man Hugo Taylor and his wife Millie Mackintosh, while Jamie's girlfriend Sophie Habboo was also in attendance. 

Vogue and Spencer met while filming The Jump in 2017 and held their first wedding the following year.
