Singapore has announced it will pay its citizens to use a new fitness app that will work with the Apple Watch. 

The government will run a two-year programme starting in October that will see users given cash rewards for hitting fitness goals.

People will be able to earn up to £215 in eVouchers, which can then be spent on things like cinema tickets, food, and clothing.

Singapore will pay its citizens to use the Apple Watch alongside a new health app, which the government hopes will encourage people to take up healthy habits

Singapore hopes the scheme will encourage people to pick up healthy habits, which will then continue after the scheme has finished.

The city-state already runs a health scheme that rewards people for completing challenges via their smartphones.

The app sets users daily health goals, which earn points, which can be redeemed into coins, which can be spent in the real world

But the introduction of the Apple Watch is the first time that a corporation has been used to help monitor people's activities.

Apple claimed that the initiative is the first of its kind, anywhere in the world.

The scheme was announced on Tuesday, at the same time Apple launched its new watch, the Series 6, which contains enhanced health features.

It includes a blood oxygen monitor that examines the color of blood flowing through the body to determine levels of oxygen.

Blood oxygen levels are typically used as a measure of fitness and heart health, reflecting how well red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. 

But Apple is now investigating whether the indicator, together with the heart rate monitor, could be used to detect early signs of Covid-19.

The scheme in Singapore works by having users download an app called LumiHealth, which links to the watch.

The announcement, which Apple called a world first, came on the same day the company announced its new Series 6  watch (pictured) 

Users complete activities which earn points, that eventually collect into coins, which can then be redeemed for vouchers to spend in the real world.

Tasks are personalised to users based on their weight, age and gender. They include step targets, as well as activities such as swimming, cycling and yoga.

'Singapore has one of the world's leading healthcare systems, and we are thrilled to be partnering with them to incorporate Apple Watch and LumiHealth into their holistic approach to well-being,' said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer. 

'Apple Watch has already helped millions of our customers manage their activity levels to improve their health, and we look forward to applying our expertise here in the same privacy-friendly way that distinguishes all Apple products and services.'
