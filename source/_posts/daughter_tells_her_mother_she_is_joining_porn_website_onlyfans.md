Thousands of Australians have been selling risqué content on OnlyFans to make money during the coronavirus recession.

And a woman named Jasmine left her mother fuming on Monday when she joked that she was flogging her nude selfies on the platform.

In an Only Lying prank call on The Kyle and Jackie O Show, the woman told her mum she had become a porn star after her 'JobKeeper ran out'. 

Shoot for the stars! One daughter told her mother she would be joining influencers like Luke Erwin (left) and Vanessa Sierra (right) by posting nude pictures on OnlyFans

'We're not getting JobKeeper anymore. I'm probably going to get back to four hours a week, so it's not that much money. So I was thinking of starting this thing called OnlyFans,' Jasmine said.

'Fans? What do you mean fans? We have air conditioning!' the mother responded.  

'Oh my god, mum! OnlyFans, it's pretty much you take nude photos and you get money for it. It's kind of like a porn site,' Jasmine clarified.

'Uhm hmm,' the unimpressed mother replied, before becoming more agitated by her daughter's indecent proposal.

Only funs! Jackie 'O' laughs during a segment were a young woman named Jasmine tells her mother she was resorting to OnlyFans because 'JobKeeper ran out' 

'Doing what you're doing isn't the right thing to do - it's just the same as being a prostitute. I don't care, I don't care!' the mother said. 

'The industry is the wrong industry. I don't care, I will never ever approve of you being a prostitute. Because that's what it is. It's prostitution. It is disgusting and it is the lowest form of life you could ever do!'

Jasmine then ramped up the prank call by asking her mother join OnlyFans too because her 'boobs are bigger' and they can produce content together. 

'I beg your pardon? Jasmine, I don't know who put this stupidity into your brain. No!' the mother furiously responded.

Concerned? Kyle listened in disbelief as the mother went as far to disown her own daughter for posting nude photos, calling her a 'disappointment' 

Things escalated when the mother vowed to disown her own daughter.

'I don't care, no matter amount of money. You are such a disappointment, you are not welcome in this house anymore doing stuff like that!' she said. 

As things the phone call reached fever pitch, radio hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson interrupted and confirmed it was just a prank. 

'It's only a joke. She's won herself $6,000 and no boob has been on display. Not an areola, not even a peak of nipple,' Kyle said.  

It was just a prank! The radio hosts eventually intervened, revealing that is was just a joke and Jasmine had been paid $6,000 for participating
