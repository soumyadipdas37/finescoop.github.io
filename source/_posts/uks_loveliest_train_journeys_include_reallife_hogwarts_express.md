The remote Settle to Carlisle Railway is one of the most famous scenic lines in the UK – and now tourists can hop onboard a daily all-first-class 'Staycation Express' charter service that runs on a section of this magnificent route.

The service, which runs until September 12, travels from the Yorkshire towns of Skipton and Settle to Appleby in Cumbria and is aimed at 'long-suffering families', to give them a great day out after months of lockdown.

According to the operator, Rail Charter Services, the train's 'classic Mark 3 InterCity coaches feature well-padded reclining seats around a private table with large windows through which guests can view the stunning Yorkshire Dales and upper Eden Valley in Cumbria'.

It has also installed perspex screens as a measure against coronavirus and boarding and alighting is by way of a socially divided one-way system.

An onboard guide provides commentary as the train passes points of interest such as Ribblehead Viaduct, Dent - the highest mainline station in England at 1,150ft (350 metres) - and Ais Gill summit, which at 1,169ft (356 metres) above sea level is the loftiest point on the Settle to Carlisle Railway.

The new timetabled charter trains operate three return trips a day, Monday to Saturday, between Skipton and Settle in Yorkshire non-stop to Appleby in Cumbria - a round-trip of 112 miles. First-class day return fares are £29 per person, or it's £99 for a family of four. To book tickets visit www.railcharterservices.co.uk.
