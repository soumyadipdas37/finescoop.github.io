A Portland man has been accused of repeatedly ramming federal officers with his vehicle. 

Lonnie Vantewa Albert, 55, was driving along Interstate 84 in Portland, Oregon on Sunday when he allegedly purposefully drove into the officers' vehicle. 

Two Federal Protective Service officers had been driving east on Interstate 84 in the early morning when they noticed a grey SUV passing to their left, according to court documents.

The officers had been in Portland as part of ongoing federal law enforcement operations amid widespread Black Lives Matter protests. 

They were wearing their government-issued uniforms when the incident happened. 

SUV driver Albert allegedly turned sharply without warning and almost hit the officers' vehicle. 

The officer who was driving attempted to change lanes and pass, but Albert kept blocking them, court documents allege. 

Albert then allegedly turned to the right and struck the officers' vehicle, causing his SUV to spin and then come to a stop. 

The officers got out of the vehicle to check on Albert, who then started up his car again and drove towards them before veering left and fleeing the scene, police say.  

The officers followed Albert to collect his license plate number and pulled into a hospital parking lot when he stopped near Adventist Health Portland.

In that moment, Albert then allegedly drove into the officers' vehicle for a second time. 

Portland police officers arrived to the scene and arrested Albert, who was booked into Multnomah County Jail on three counts of failure to perform the duties of a driver and one count of reckless driving. 

Albert faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison if convicted.
