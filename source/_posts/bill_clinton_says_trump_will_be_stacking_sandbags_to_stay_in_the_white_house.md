Bill Clinton has joked that Donald Trump will be 'stacking sandbags' on the day of Joe Biden's inauguration, preparing to fight off attempts to make him conceded defeat. 

Speaking with his wife Hillary on an Instagram Live interview with American Urban Radio, Clinton, 74, was asked to envisage January 2021. 

Host April Ryan, Washington bureau chief for the network, joked that Trump's 'orange knuckles' won't let go of his Oval Office desk. 

The former president laughed and replied: 'He probably won't even come to Biden's inauguration. 

'He'll be stacking sandbags around in the White House.'

Bill Clinton joked on Monday that Donald Trump would likely be 'stacking sandbags' around the White House in January 2021, to dig in and prevent his departure, if Joe Biden wins

His wife has been repeatedly advising Biden not to concede on the night of November 3, saying that the significant number of mail-in votes will make tallying the count a mammoth task.

On Tuesday she repeated the advice. 

'Do not concede under any circumstance because I believe the other side is going to cheat and sneak and try everything they possibly can,' she said.

Trump has stated several times that he might not accept the result.

'I have to see,' he told Fox News on July 19. 

'No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no, and I didn't last time either.' 

She urged people once again to be sure to register to vote, and to mail in their votes with plenty of time.

She said the Trump administration was intentionally sabotaging the postal service to limit mail-in voting, as they believe that a large turnout does not help their cause.

The former Secretary of State told viewers that the November 3 vote was of vital importance to the nation.

'He is a clear and present danger to our freedoms, our liberties, our unity, and we've got to defeat him,' she said. 

'There is no alternative.' 

Donald Trump, asked whether he would respect the election result, said he would wait and see

Her husband was equally damning of the man they used to socialize with - famously attending his January 2005 wedding to Melania. 

He accused Trump of using scare tactics to try and frighten people into voting for him. 

'It's very important to keep in mind that beneath all these big questions you are asking are just Donald Trump's proven ability to manipulate the psyche of the people that he is trying to scare the hell out of,' said Clinton. 

'Now, this is a person who says, 'OK, I can't win on my own, but people will believe whatever I tell them as long as it's bad.'

He added: 'He cannot help who he is. He is who he is. He believes we're suckers. He believes he can say anything and make it work. He believes he can do anything and no one will stop [him].'
