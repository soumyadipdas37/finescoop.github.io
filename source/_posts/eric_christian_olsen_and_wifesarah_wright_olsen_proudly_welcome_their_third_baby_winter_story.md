Actorly couple Eric Christian Olsen and Sarah Wright Olsen are proud parents for the third time around.

As seen on People, the NCIS: Los Angeles star, 43, and his Marry Me actress wife, 36, welcomed baby daughter Winter Story in Los Angeles, California on Tuesday.

Sarah took to Instagram over the weekend to share the happy news, with a beautiful photo of mom nursing the new arrival while dad, shirtless, stood over them with a mask on. 

 She’s here!!! “As we collectively navigate the chaos and existential crisis that is 2020 we anchor ourselves with the things that matter most. Family, friends and human connection. Winter Story Olsen came to us sept 15th. She’s 10lbs 4 ounces of newborn bliss. Mama and baby are doing great, home safe surrounded by a cuddle puddle of kids and giant dogs. Life is equal parts spectacular and fleeting; Love fearlessly.” - @ericcolsen ✨🌙🌈💫🙌🏻

Eric gazed proudly at the camera in the snap.

Sarah also included a timely and inspirational message along with the post.   

 'She's here!!!' the American Made star began. 

'As we collectively navigate the chaos and existential crisis that is 2020 we anchor ourselves with the things that matter most. Family, friends and human connection.

'Winter Story Olsen came to us sept 15th,' Sarah continued. 'She's 10lbs 4 ounces of newborn bliss. Mama and baby are doing great, home safe surrounded by a cuddle puddle of kids and giant dogs.

'Life is equal parts spectacular and fleeting; Love fearlessly ✨,' she concluded, tagging her husband and including several other emojis. 

One of the emojis was a rainbow, surely referring to Sarah's miscarriage last year.

The news of Sarah and Eric expecting their new child in May was joyful, but also mixed with sadness, as that was when it was revealed that they had suffered a miscarriage, late last year.

In a blog post about the loss of her baby, Sarah reflected that it was 'a big disappointment, and then also it's just really something that's not in your control, so it just felt sad. 

'And I felt a little bit lonely,' she continued.
