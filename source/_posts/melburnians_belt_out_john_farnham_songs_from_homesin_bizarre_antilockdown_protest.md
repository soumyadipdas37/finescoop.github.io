Melburnians have blasted John Farnham songs from their front yards in an extraordinary 'mini' anti-lockdown protest.

Several hundred residents gathered in the CBD on Saturday to illegally protest against the city strict stage four lockdown, which sparked clashes with police.

But locals in a suburban street opted to protest legally from their own homes later that night which didn't involve breaching the strict night curfew or risking a $1652 fine.

One young woman uploaded a TikTok video of a note put in her letterbox on Saturday inviting the neighbourhood to take part in street protest at 8pm that night.

'Want to express you frustration? Don't want to get a fine?' the letter starts.

'Neither do we.  

'At 8pm, we will standing in a front yard and playing three John Farnham tunes on full noise. 

'Please join us from your front yard to belt them out.'   

The author selected That's Freedom, Chain Reaction and You're the Voice as the Farnsy classics to be played.

'I f*****ng love my neighbourhood,' the woman says in the video.

This Melbourne woman embraced the idea of a mini anti-lockdown protest in her street

The woman posted a second clip clarifying why she thought the neighbourhood protest was a great idea after her original video went viral online and was inundated with comments.

'We're all going through so many emotions at this time as lockdown is really frustarting,' she said

'But instead of being idiot and going to the city, I think it's a good idea to be a community andexpress how you feel in the right way.' 

'I didn't expect it to blow up the way it did but it did.' 

Hours later, the woman was back getting ready to livestream the street protest.

'I'll be disappointed if this thing doesn't turn out good,' she says while enjoying a drink.

'I'm trying to get excited.'

But right on time as promised, the darkened street came to life where several neighbours can be seen standing in their driveways blasting Farnham's hit Chain Reaction.

'This is the turn out guys, It's not that bad,' the woman says.

'There's a few others down the street playing it too.'

Police issued more than 160 fines at Saturday's earlier protest to those breaching lockdown measures or not wearing a mask. 

Metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire are subject to stage four restrictions including an evening curfew and a ban on travelling beyond a five-kilometre radius of home.



Australian's second largest city will remain in stage four lockdown until at least September 28 after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews extended it by two weeks on Sunday. 

Regional Victoria remains under stage three restrictions which allows residents to leave home for essential purposes.

Premier Andrews has also released road map out of lockdown as Victoria recorded 41 new cases and five deaths on Monday.
