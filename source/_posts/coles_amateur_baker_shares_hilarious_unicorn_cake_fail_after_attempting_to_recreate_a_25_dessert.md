Laura Jayne created the unicorn cake

A home baker has shared a hilarious cake fail on social media after attempting to recreate a $25 pre-made unicorn cake from Coles.

Laura Jayne, from Perth in Western Australia, had wanted a delicious fondant-encrusted cake like the popular version from the supermarket - but she decided to make it herself. 

'We were pretty sure we could buy a packet mix from Coles and replicate the unicorn cake. I personally think the resemblance is uncanny,' she wrote in a Facebook group, along with a photo showing her efforts.

The resulting cake had a mess of pink icing swirls over a vanilla cake with two pieces of Toblerone chocolate on top as makeshift 'horns'.

One of Laura's friends sarcastically said she had 'nailed it' while others simple 'liked' her efforts.

The supermarket's original unicorn cake is made in the United Kingdom and shipped to Australia, although it's temporarily unavailable online.

It is made using sponge cake ingredients and features gold eyelashes on the front of the dessert.

Customers can also purchase a caramel drip cake for $20, a chocolate and pink vanilla drip cake for $25 and the typical $4.80 white and chocolate mud cake beloved for birthday parties.

While it's common for amateur chefs to stack the mud cakes and DIY their own larger cakes, Laura's didn't go according to plan.

Vanessa, from Brisbane, Queensland was more successful, curating a wedding cake out of Woolworths' version of the mud cakes.

In the video the 36-year-old makes the dessert by stacking three of the $4.80 cakes on top of one another and topping them with icing and decorative flowers.

Between each layer Vanessa spread a creamy filling and smeared icing around the outside of the cake.

To create the ombre effect, she used three different food colourings and applied it through a piping bag before smoothing it out.

She then arranged artificial flowers on top of the wedding cake to complete the elegant look.
