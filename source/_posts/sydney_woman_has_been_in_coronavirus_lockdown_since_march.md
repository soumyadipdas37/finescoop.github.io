A woman in her 20s has revealed why she has been in self-imposed lockdown for 183 days. 

Jazzy Regan lives with her parents, five siblings and her 84-year-old grandmother, in Sydney. 

The whole family are concerned about infecting Ms Regan's elderly grandmother and went into strict lockdown when coronavirus swept Australia in March.

Ms Regan, who works with social media, was so determined not to leave her parent's house that she moved in her boyfriend.  

She is also worried about her own health because she suffers from severe asthma and always thinks winter will be the 'death' of her. 

'I'm high risk and my grandma is even more high risk than I am,' she told news.com.au.    

Jazzy Regan, who shares a home with her boyfriend, five siblings, parents and 84-year-old grandmother, has been holed up inside since coronavirus swept Australia back in March

'Last year I had a chest infection three times (and was hospitalised). That's why we were so scared — if I can't even get through winter in a normal season, what would COVID-19 be like?' 

There are only 84 active coronavirus cases in New South Wales, with just six new infections recorded across the state on Saturday.

Sydneysiders are living relatively 'normal' lives after successfully controlling the COVID-19 outbreak.

Restaurants, bars and shops are open with the implementation of COVID-19 safety protocols and the enforcement of social distancing. 

Ms Regan is high risk to the virus as she suffers from severe asthma and allergies

Ms Regan's boyfriend Robbie Wilson moved in with the family in March so the couple wouldn't be separated throughout the health crisis.

No one in the household-of-ten left the home during lockdown and the family instead opted to get their groceries delivered.

But with coronavirus restrictions eventually eased and life reaching a 'new normal' in Sydney, Ms Regan's younger siblings were required to go back to school. 

The family decided to adopt a 'shielding approach', where her siblings are segregated to their bedrooms and use a different shower and living space.

Ms Regan, who is known as DJ JAZZY on her social media profiles, still gets her groceries delivered and shops online. 

It was only last month the content producer decided to leave her house to go for local strolls.  

Unlike most people her age, Ms Regan has enjoyed her time confined to her home. 

'I think the fact that we are at our age (and not going out) confuses some people. My friends don't understand it at all,' she said.

Ms Regan transformed her living room into a 'mini F45 gym' during her COVID-19 lockdown. She has even lost seven kilograms

The pandemic has probably been the 'best time ever' for Ms Regan - as she has learnt to cook and transformed her living room into a 'mini F45 gym'.

She said she has even lost seven kilograms during her self-imposed lockdown.

Ms Regan, a producer and singer-songwriter, has been able to work from home by pushing her career on social media.

She said her YouTube channels saw 'crazy' success during lockdown - which she plans to continue focusing on. 

The pandemic has given Ms Regan the opportunity to spend time doing things she loves, rather than being distracted by the social pressure to go out all the time.
