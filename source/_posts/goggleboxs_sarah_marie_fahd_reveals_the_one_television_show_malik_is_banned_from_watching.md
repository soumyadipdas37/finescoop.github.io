'Oh, my sweet mercy - can you imagine? I think that's going to be one of the show's that's banned in this house when he gets old enough,' she said.

Matty, 33, recently said that he wasn't a fan of 'trash reality shows'.

Speaking to WHO Magazine in August, he said: 'My favourite thing to watch is David Attenborough. I'm a massive animal lover so I love getting to watch shows like that.'
