Drew Barrymore saved an iconic piece of Hollywood prop history to pass along to her two young daughters.

The 45-year-old actress admitted to being 'terrible at keeping things' from her storied decades-long career but did hold onto something from one of her very first films, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

Barrymore dished about keeping her iconic red cowboy hat from the 1982 flick in the cover story for the inaugural issue of Domino Kids magazine.

Hollywood history: Drew Barrymore admitted to being 'terrible at keeping things' from her career but said did hold onto her iconic red cowboy hat from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, in a new interview with Domino Kids

'I am absolutely terrible at keeping things,' Drew revealed. 'I lose everything. But I do have the red cowboy hat I wore in E.T. '

'It is in the girls’ room somewhere and reminds me that I was 6 years old wearing that hat. I’m so glad I still have it,' Drew said. 

Adding: 'When we’re kids, we don’t think something will be important to us one day; we clean out our room and throw stuff away. It’s nice if parents put something of theirs in their kids’ rooms, so it’s a transference of memories and energy.'

A Kindergarten-aged Drew co-starred in the film, directed by Steven Spielberg, as young Gertie - the baby sister of lead character Elliott. It was the young actor's second film of her career.   

'I am absolutely terrible at keeping things,' Drew revealed. 'I lose everything. But I do have the red cowboy hat I wore in E.T. It is in the girls’ room somewhere and reminds me that I was 6 years old wearing that hat. I’m so glad I still have it' (Drew pictured in 1982)

Drew, who was interviewed for the magazine by 12-year-old entrepreneur and philanthropist Jonah Larson, said that her unique upbringing working in Hollywood from a young age eventually lead her to the creation of her new home line.

'I had always lived in hotel rooms and apartments and weird places all over the world for my job, and I never knew where I was going to be living next,' she said. 'But then I realized I didn’t have a stable base.'

Drew purchased a home two decades ago and has spent the last 20 years slowly refurbishing it.  

'When we’re kids, we don’t think something will be important to us one day; we clean out our room and throw stuff away. It’s nice if parents put something of theirs in their kids’ rooms, so it’s a transference of memories and energy.'

'I created this wonderful home and fell in love with decorating,' the Flower Home designer said. 'The more you get into interior design, the more you learn about different styles and read every interiors magazine (I’m obsessed with them—that is my happy place), and discover designers who teach you things.' 

Drew's daughters, Olive, eight, and Frankie, six, are around the same age now that their mom was as a working child actor in E.T..

But, unlike Drew who lived in the spotlight from the age of six, she and her ex Will Kopelman are typically very private about their children.

In a rare move, both of the girls appear do in the cover of Domino Kids as well as some inside images but their faces are obscured in all of the photos. 

The magazine was created during the pandemic and gives readers direction on how to navigate being at home with kids all the time in the 'new normal' of COVID-19 with tips on getting creative, play time and organizing.  

Drew has been busier than ever recently between the launch of her wildly popular Flower Home line at Walmart - which expanded her Flower brand from a cruelty-free makeup line and eye wear line into the decor space - as well as the debut of The Drew Barrymore Show.
