They lost competitor Carole Baskin last week on the famed Disney night.

And Dancing With The Stars hosted another round of rehearsals Wednesday night, with star Chrishell Stause leading the back in lovely lavender marble print leggings.

The Selling Sunset star, 39, paired her bottoms with layered white sleeveless tops, one of which was knotted to allow a sliver of her midriff to show.

The former soap star went in to the Los Angeles, California studio with her dance partner Gleb Savchenko, and arrived noticeably later than the other competitors. 

Chrishell let her blond hair hang loose around her shoulders, and handled her face mask while the shutterbugs flashed. 

She wore white trainers, and had a fancy white Chanel pocketbook with gold chain hanging from her arm.

Stause also had a big black backpack on her shoulder.

She smiled on the way in, and with good reason – Chrishell and Gleb earned their best scores yet last week, with their Cinderella-inspired performance. 

Others joining Chrishell for rehearsal included Skai Jackson, who also kept things casual in cropped black leggings and an oversized 'Go Vote' t-shirt.

The 'V' in the vote of the 18-year-old Disney star's tee was an illustration of a hand making a peace sign.

Skai was listening to her earbuds and had a big smile on her face as she made her way inside.

Later, she was again seen with a red face mask saying 'Do Not D' sturb' and carrying a takeout bag of McDonalds.

Other Dancing Stars putting in their time on Wednesday included actress Anne Heche.

The Return To Paradise star, 51, waved to onlookers in a festive cantaloupe sweater top, paired with black wide-legged trousers.

Anne layered two necklaces as part of her ensemble, including one overlong knotted string of pearls.
