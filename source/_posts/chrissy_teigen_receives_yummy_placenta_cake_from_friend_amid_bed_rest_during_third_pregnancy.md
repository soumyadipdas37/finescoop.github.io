Chrissy Teigen has been on bed rest amid her latest pregnancy, which has also forced her to postpone some work commitments.

But the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model has plenty to keep her entertained, as she prepares to welcome baby number three.

She got quite the laugh out of a very graphic placenta cake Friday, as she took to her Instagram Story to show off the thoughtful dessert she received from friend and makeup artist Kristine Studden.

The 34-year-old could be heard laughing in the background of the video, as she exclaimed: 'Oh my god! Oh my god, thank you Kristine. This is so disgusting!'

'Who's gonna eat this?' husband John Legend, 41, asked, to which she passionately responded: 'Me! I'm going to... Oh my god, the cord.'

She then joked with daughter Luna Simone, four: 'Luna, did you know that you can make this into a smoothie? This whole thing? You can make it into a smoothie.'

'Mommy, can I eat this?' the oblivious toddler asked her mom, who laughed as she responded: 'Sure!'

Staying healthy: Chrissy later posted another video to her Insta Story, giving a glimpse of a compression device wrapped around her leg, during bed rest

Whoops! The topic of blood clots apparently carried on into a private group chat after that post, as she revealed she accidentally sent a very graphic photo to the wrong chat

Wrong number: She then shared a screenshot of the chat in question, but she was courteous enough to black out the image

Chrissy later posted another video to her Insta Story, giving a glimpse of a compression device wrapped around her leg, during bed rest.

She explained: 'A lot of you got a glimpse of these guys. It is like a little machine that compresses your legs. You get it when you're on bed rest or when you're in the hospital, so you don't get blood clots.

'Because that's what happens when you lay down for too long, and it can be really dangerous. So, I have these on for a few weeks.'

The topic of blood clots apparently carried on into a private group chat after that post, as she revealed she accidentally sent a very graphic photo to the wrong chat.

The Lip Sync Battle host checked in once again, this time using a dog face filter, telling her 31.3million followers: 'I just sent the most disgusting photo to the group chat of a blood clot that I like caught... from my pee.

'It was huge. I don't know if it's a clot, I don't know what the hell it is. It's like a giant ball, a bloody ball. And I posted it in the group chat, but it was the wrong group chat.'

Mama's boy: Chrissy previously posted the baby's first 3D ultrasound to her story, writing: 'Hi my sweet strong boy. You are working so hard, I promise it'll be worth it!!!'

Gender reveal: It comes after she accidentally revealed the sex of their new baby to her followers last week in another Insta Story

It's a boy! Chrissy said while opening up about the complications that required her bed rest: 'It's so weird because the baby's really really healthy. He's big. He’s probably, oops! That was stupid'

She then shared a screenshot of the chat in question, but she was courteous enough to black out the image.

She covered her mouth when she realized what she said, writing with the video: 'hahahahaha might as well tell you' 

Chrissy also opened up on Insta about her health complications with her previous pregnancies, revealing: 'My placenta sucks.'

Bed rest: But she remained optimistic about her new addition: 'We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest'

Postponed: She recently revealed that she's put her third cookbook on hold indefinitely, amid complications with the pregnancy (pictured in September, 2018)

She continued: 'It’s always been kind of the bad part of my pregnancies with Luna. With Miles, it just stopped feeding him. It stopped taking care of him. 

'I was stealing all his food because I was getting huge but he wasn’t getting big at all, so he had to come out early and Luna had to come out early. I was induced both times.'

But The Chrissy's Court star remained optimistic about her new addition: 'Everything’s good. I’m feeling really good, but my placenta’s really, really weak and it’s causing me to really bleed a lot. So basically, it’s just pretty high risk.

'This poor thing has been through so much already. We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest.'

She recently revealed that she's put her third cookbook on hold indefinitely, amid complications with the pregnancy. 

Chrissy shares daughter Luna Simone, four, and son Miles Theodore, two, with husband John Legend, 41, whom she married in 2013.
