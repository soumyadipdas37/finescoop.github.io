She is in the midst of a promotional tour for her forthcoming album, Disco.

And Kylie Minogue celebrated the release of her new single Magic by heading out for dinner with friends on Thursday, after revealing she has found love with boyfriend Paul Solomons. 

The pop icon, 52, turned heads in a electric pink silk shirt dress as she arrived for her pal's party in South London.

The full-length dress sheathed over Kylie's slender frame and teased a glimpse of her toned legs thanks to a racy side split. 

She added a boost to her height with black suede ankle boots and complemented the look with a clutch bag and gold hoop earrings. 

The Can't Get You Out Of My Head hitmaker wore her blonde hair in a straight, flicked out style and complemented her eye-catching dress with a polished make-up look.

The evening out comes after Kylie praised her 'supportive' boyfriend Paul for staying by her side when she was sick. 

The Australian pop star was forced to cancel gigs on her Golden Tour in October 2018 after coming down with an infection, but revealed Paul helped nurse her back to health. 

Joking that the creative was 'thrown into the deep end' by dating her, Kylie told The Sun: 'He had to come to the rescue a few times on tour when I was really unwell. He'd swoop in and hold me in a way that no one else can.'

Kylie continued: 'He cares about my fans, he cares about my world, but mostly he cares about me. It's so nice to have that one person who's not involved in your tour, not in that way, and just wants to know that I'm OK.'

Gushing that things were going 'really good' between the pair, she concluded:  We're really low-key, we're very real, very supportive. We're just taking things as they come for now, for always. Who knows what's to come?'   

The couple have been going from strength to strength since they first laid eyes on each other when they were introduced through mutual friends in February 2018.

Kylie met Paul - who works as GQ magazine’s creative director - following the breakdown of her relationship with Joshua Sasse. 

The singer and her actor ex-fiancé Joshua, now 32, announced their split in February 2017 after three years together. 

At the time, unconfirmed reports claimed the singer booted the British actor out of her West London home after he grew too close to Spanish actress Marta Milans, 35.

After their split the songstress, who said she felt 'broken at the time, took herself to Thailand to 'heal' herself.
