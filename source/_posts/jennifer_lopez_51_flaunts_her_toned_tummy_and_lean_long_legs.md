Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez put in a lot of time at the gym and on Thursday the engaged couple showed off the fruits of their hard labor.

The Hustlers actress was first to show off her body as she shared two new images to Instagram - one where she was flashing her legs and the other where she put her midsection on display.

Next, the former baseball player served up a shirtless photo in a pair of swim trunks while on the beach.

J-Lo, whose next film is Marry Me with Owen Wilson, looked like a natural pinup in her twin photos.

In one shot she wears a thin white shirt that is pulled off one shoulder with undies and no pants.

She is laying on a bed with her snakeskin high heeled boots the focal point.

In the other shot she is in a crochet bra top and ripped jeans with a knit jacket and tennis shoes.

'I ❤️❤️❤️ my new snakeskin and sparkle boots!' said the Bronx native in her caption.

'Check out all the new styles from my #JLoJenniferLopez collection @dsw.' She then credited the photographer Greg Swalesart. 

Alex, Drea DeMatteo, Tamra Judge and Melissa Gorga clicked like.

Not letting himself go: For his photo, Alex looked to be in top shape as he posed with one leg up on a lounger as he looked at footage. The athlete captioned his image, 'They’ve said my Zoom background is fake ... but it’s been real this whole time'

The athlete captioned his image, 'They’ve said my Zoom background is fake ... but it’s been real this whole time... Quick meeting with my partner and buddy Marc Lore! #WorkNeverStops.'

Within 10 minutes Jenny From The Block added three fire emojis.

This comes after the pair sold their Malibu home for $6,775,000, just a year after they purchased it. 

While they made a small profit of approximately $175,000, they were certainly hoping for more. They were initially shooting for a $1million pay day when they first listed the home for $7.99million in July.

The couple bought the property in February 2019 from Entourage star Jeremy Piven for $6.6million.  

The pair reportedly 'planned to live in the house, but they had a change of heart and decided to sell,' according to TMZ. 

To help with renovations on the three-level, five-bedroom home, the power couple enlisted Joanna Gaines of HGTV fame for the job.   

The 51-year-old pop diva invited Joanna over for a walk through shortly after snagging the spot and were pictured on the beach together in March 2019.

'Jennifer wanted to walk the space with Joanna in person,' an insider told People at the time. 'They’re both extremely busy, but it’s hard to take on any kind of home project without actually seeing the space.

According to the source, the meeting was 'really just an opportunity for them to walk the space together and for Joanna to hear Jennifer’s vision for the space.' the meeting was 'really just an opportunity for them to walk the space together and for Joanna to hear Jennifer’s vision for the space.' 

The 4,400 square foot house is right on the beach, staring out into the Pacific Ocean with an outdoor deck that is perfect for watching sunsets. It is part of a luxurious stretch of sand known as Jane Seymour Beach because the actress lived in the area.

The home has a classic charm, built in 1949. But it still comes will modern amenities, featuring a steam sauna, spacious closets and a lush front courtyard. 

It was listed by Carl Gambino of Compass. 

The Hustlers actress and MLB star had an easier time offloading the property than the previous owner, who listed the house for a hefty $10.495million in June 2017, before lowering the price multiple times during protracted attempts to make a sale. 

The Mr. Selfridge star originally purchased the property for $3.5 million in 2004 and is said to have invested significantly in his own renovations. 

J. Lo still has a robust portfolio of real estate after selling the property.

The Latina star owns a multimillion dollar New York penthouse, a mansion in California’s Hidden Hills and a 13,932 square-foot estate in exclusive Los Angeles suburb Bel Air, purchased for a reported $40million in 2017.

She also has a $10 million mansion in the Hamptons and a compound in Coral Gables, Florida.
