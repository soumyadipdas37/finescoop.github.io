Three children cheated death after a 13-year-old boy stole his stepfather's car for a 125mph nighttime joyride.

A video shows Russian traffic police giving chase to the Toyota Сamry on the outskirts of Moscow.

The high speed spin lasted around three hours before the vehicle crashed into a highway barrier at 5:30am.

A 13-year-old took the keys to his father's car, leading police on a high-speed chase for around three hours, before finally crashing into a barrier on the motorway, wrecking the car (pictured)

Schoolboy Lev, a go-karting fanatic, was the one to take the keys, and picked up two friends - girl Polina, 12, and boy Zakhar, 13. All three suffered injuries and required treatment in hospital, but miraculously survived the crash

Schoolboy Lev, a go-karting fanatic, took the keys of the Toyota and picked up two friends, girl Polina, 12, and boy Zakhar, 13.

Police tailed the trio after Lev refused to stop at a police checkpoint in Krasnogorsk.

Officers said the Toyota's speed reached 200 kilometres an hour - or 125 mph - with the driver 'deftly' overtaking while well exceeding the speed limit.

But Lev finally lost control, ramming a barrier on the busy Minsk highway, a motorway that runs between Moscow and Minsk in Belarus.

He suffered multiple injuries but escaped the smoking car. 

Zakhar crashed through the windscreen but fortunately only suffered minor wounds, while Polina broke several ribs. All three required hospital treatment.

One report said it was 'miraculous' the children had survived with the car severely damaged.

The children's parents have not commented, but Zakhar's grandmother Irina said: 'The traffic police noticed them and gave chase.

'But how did they turn to be on the Minsk motorway? I don't know how they got there. I don't know. They were scared, they had to stop.'

A spokesman for the Russian Investigative Committee said the action of the police in staging a high speed chase will be investigated amid fears it encouraged the teenage driver to go even faster.

'One of the accident victims took his stepfather's car without his knowledge and called two of his friends to drive around Moscow,' the spokesman said.

'During the trip, due to a violation of traffic rules, the children's car was pursued by a crew of traffic police officers.

'The teenager lost control of the steering wheel and crashed into a barrier. A check will provide a legal assessment of the actions of the police officers.'
