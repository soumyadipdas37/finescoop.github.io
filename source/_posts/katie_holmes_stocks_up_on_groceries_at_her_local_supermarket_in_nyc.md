She recently spoke about how quarantining with her daughter Suri has been a valuable lesson and has only strengthened their bond.

Katie teamed her items of clothing with a gold pendant necklace and a set of stylish black sunglasses. 

Sticking to her casual look, the ex-wife of Tom Cruise finished her ensemble with a pair of Birkenstock.

Katie left her luscious brunette locks into a loose tousled hairdo and she appeared to go makeup-free.

Sticking to cautious measures amid the Covid-19 crisis, the Hollywood actress donned a blue face mask.

Meanwhile, Katie is notoriously private when it comes to discussing life with her daughter Suri, 14, who she shares with ex-husband Tom Cruise. 

But during an interview for Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph earlier this month, the actress gave a rare insight. 

The actress revealed how quarantining with Suri in New York has made her 'look at everything' she has, and celebrate simple tasks such as making dinner. 

'I like to keep her out of my interviews, but I will say that this time of quarantine has been such a lesson,' Katie told the publication via a video conference app.

'Just really looking at everything you have and celebrating the simplicity of making dinner and [spending] that time together.' 

The star, who shot to fame in 90's American teen drama series Dawson's Creek, went on to reveal how she feels 'very blessed' with her life. 

'When I think about my life, I feel very blessed. I have felt very lucky and I rely on my instincts a lot but I also forgive myself for mistakes,' she said. 

Katie wed Tom in 2006, welcoming Suri in April of that year. The couple split in 2012.
