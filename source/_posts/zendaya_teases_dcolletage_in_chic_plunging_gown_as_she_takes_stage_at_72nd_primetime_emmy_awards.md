Zendaya is on top of the world, after receiving her first nomination at this year's 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

And the former Disney Channel star was one of only a few celebs to appear on the show in person, instead of telecasting from home.

She teased her décolletage Sunday in a chic plunging Christopher John Rogers gown, as she took to the stage at the Downtown Los Angeles studio, where Jimmy Kimmel was hosting.

The 24-year-old's dress featured an open black top, which showed off a dazzling purple jeweled Bulgari necklace.

It was tucked into a purple moiré cummerbund with a matching structured taffeta skirt, featuring an exaggerated hourglass silhouette. 

She finished the ensemble with diamond stud earrings and a pair of black Christian Louboutin stilettos, with jeweled embellishments.

Zendaya showed off the ensemble before the awards show, doing a twirl for celebrity stylist and pal Law Roach on her Instagram Story.

Representation matters: Zendaya spoke onstage about the importance of representation: 'Television has the power to influence and shape our culture'

She spoke onstage about the importance of representation: 'Television has the power to influence and shape our culture. Sometimes, it can reflect who we are or distort it. 

'Far too often, it falls short of ideal and challenges us to be better. When the potential of television is unlocked, it forces us to recognize that, despite our vast and many differences, we share an unbreakable human bond. 

'And when we see ourselves in one another, the differences can fade away. So who decides what stories are told? Which experiences are valid? The truth in storytelling has to lie with those who have lived these stories on a daily basis.'

The Euphoria star also received her first Emmy nomination, as her portrayal of Rue Bennett is up for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

She's up against Jennifer Aniston, Olivia Colman, Jodie Comer, Laura Linney and Sandra Oh for the coveted statue.

Such an honor: Zendaya previously took to Instagram to express her excitement over the nomination

Zendaya previously wrote on Instagram about the nomination: 'I’m honestly speechless, my heart is just overflowing with love and gratitude. I’m so incredibly honored to work beside the talented people that I get to call family. 

'I am a small piece of a big beautiful puzzle and I’m so proud of all of you. Thank you to everyone out there who’s watched and given our show life, thank you @samlev00 @hbo @a24 for everything and @televisionacad for this beautiful acknowledgment, thank you, thank you, thank you. We out here Emmy nominated y’all!!'

Winners have been visited at home by award presenters in black tuxedo-style hazmat gear, designed specially for the event.

For the first time in its 72-year history, this year's show was telecast from the homes of presenters, nominees and winners around the world, keeping with COVID-19 safety protocols. 

Host Jimmy Kimmel recorded live from a studio in Downtown Los Angeles, while producers sent more than 150 video kits to other talent, for them to record from home.
