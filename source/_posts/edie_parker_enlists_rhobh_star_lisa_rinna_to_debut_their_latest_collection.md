New York Fashion Week is in full effect but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, designers have had to alter how they present their latest collections.

In lieu of traditional runway shows and presentations, brands like Edie Parker are getting creative. But we would expect nothing less from the iconic accessories label.  

This season, Edie Parker has enlisted RHOBH’s Lisa Rinna to debut its newest collection via a nostalgic infomercial, inspired by the beloved and equally kitschy Home Shopping Network.

And if Lisa's hilarious delivery doesn't convince viewers to purchase a bag, the label's tongue-in-cheek offerings sure will!

Like a true infomercial, the set up takes place in a large minimal kitchen. 

Lisa looks fierce standing behind a sizable marble counter in a leopard dress with her signature short tresses perfectly in place and her makeup flawless. 

Downstage are never-before-seen Edie Parker designs propped up on full display in front of the Bravo star.

In her best Home Shopping Network voice, the reality star introduces herself by saying 'Hi! I'm Lisa Rinna and welcome to Edie Parker's 2021 spring collection.'

From there, her candid personality takes over.  

 'I mean, here's hoping that there is a 2021 spring, right?,' she adds while doing the sign of the cross.

Lisa asks: 'Is this not gorgeous?' 

While picking up a bag featuring a mushroom, she's taken a back by the craftsmanship saying, 'Look at the inlay on the bag, are you kidding me, it's art, honey.'

In addition to handbags, Edie Parker designed The Baroque Collection, a line of decor, which the housewife says is 'like home goods on steroids.'

A picture frame featuring a snapshot of her husband, actor Harry Hamlin, sits on the kitchen counter until it sells out. 

'Our lines are blowing up,' she says. They just told me the frame sold out, of course it did, because it's Harry Hamlin.'

Winning: Games like Connect Four and Tic Tac Toe are a part of the offerings, even though Lisa admits she hates games

Games like Connect Four and Tic Tac Toe are a part of the offerings, even though Lisa admits she hates games and that they'll only keep your kids occupied for 10 minutes.   

'Call now and your wildest dreams will come true and that's an absolute promise,' declares Lisa. 

For her exit, the actress clutches a watermelon bowl under her arm and walks off set.
