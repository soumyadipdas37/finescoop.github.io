Out of the loop: Caitlyn, who has launched her own YouTube channel (pictured), revealed she hadn't been told in advance that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be coming to an end 

Caitlyn, who has recently launched her own YouTube channel, revealed in an interview with an Australian TV show that she had not been given advance notice that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be coming to an end after 14 years and 20 seasons.  

She told Australia's The Morning Show that she found out about the end of KUWTK on the news like everyone else.

'Nobody called me, I heard it through the media. Was I surprised? No,' she added. 

Not told: 'Nobody called me, I heard it through the media,' the former Olympic decathlete, who is the father of Kendall and Kylie Jenner, said in an interview with Australia's The Morning Show

Reality show: Caitlyn was a regular part of Keeping Up with the Kardashians from its debut in 2007 until her divorce from Kris Jenner in 2015 and subsequent gender transition. She went on to star for two seasons on the E! spin-off I Am Cait in 2016

She then praised her ex-wife Kris Jenner and their family, saying: 'That show, it's probably the greatest reality show in history. There are over 500 episodes over 14 years.'

The former Olympian decathlete declared: 'The girls and Kris have have done just an amazing job with the show and keeping it going for this long. But everybody is in a different place now and I think it's time to move on. But what a run.'

The reality show was the brainchild of Kris and TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest, and followed the lives of Kris' family, which included Caitlyn - then Bruce - along with daughters Kendall and Kylie, and Kris' four children from her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob.

At the beginning, it was Bruce who was the celebrity given his fame as a gold medalist in the decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. 

But in the intervening 13 years, he has been eclipsed by the phenomenal popularity of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings, who turned their family's fame into a multi-million dollar empire.
