Dancing On Ice star Brianne Delcourt is expecting her first child with Kevin Kilbane. 

The couple, who met last year when they were partnered on the ITV skating show, also revealed that they tied the knot earlier this month in Canada.

Speaking to OK! magazine, Brianne, 39, revealed she is five months pregnant and that the news came as a shock, but made their wedding all the more special. 

Great news: Dancing On Ice star Brianne Delcourt is expecting her first child with Kevin Kilbane (pictured in February)

Kevin, 42, told the magazine: 'Everything may seem fast in other people’s eyes and we can’t believe it ourselves but we do everything together so this was naturally the next step.'

As well as revealing their baby news, the couple confirmed that they married earlier this month after the pandemic forced them to cancel their dream wedding in Ireland.

Discussing their ceremony, which took place at Bonnie View Inn in Haliburton, Ontario, Brianne noted: 'When I look back now I realise it worked out perfectly. It was intimate and just about Kevin and I.'

Due to Covid travelling restrictions, the couple were unable to have any guests with them from the UK, so their nuptials were attended only by Brianne's daughter Gracie, three, her immediate family, and two friends. 

Yet the pair still had an incredible day, with Brianne gushing: 'It was amazing. Of course we had Gracie with us, but to also have our baby in my stomach too it to a complete other level. The baby kicked as we said "I do".' 

This is the couple's first child together. Although they have yet to learn the sex of their baby, Brianne confirmed their baby is due in February. 

The professional skater raises daughter Gracie with an unnamed ex.

Meanwhile, Kevin has two daughters, 16-year-old Elsie and 14-year-old Isla, with his ex-wife Laura, who he split from in 2011 after 12 years of marriage. 

Brianne and Kevin sparked speculation that they wed earlier this month when she took to Instagram to post a photo of themselves clinking champagne glasses . 

Brianne wrote: 'So, today was the day Kevin & I were supposed to be getting married in Ireland 09-04-2020. Damn you Covid..., so we celebrated our way .......'.
