Singer Usher is a dad for the third time.

The 41-year-old R&B crooner announced the birth of his 'beautiful baby girl' Sovereign with girlfriend Jenn Goicoechea, 36, in an Instagram post on Wednesday. 

It's been less than a year since the couple embarked upon their whirlwind romance, as they were first linked together last October.

Usher gushed over his new bundle of joy in a social media post where he shared a photo of the newborn's teeny hand holding onto his finger.

'We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. 'Isn't She lovely' by Stevie Wonder on repeat,' he penned in the caption.

Little Sovereign is Usher and Jenn's first child together. However, the eight-time Grammy winner is dad to sons Usher V, 12, and Naviyd, 11.

News first broke that the couple was expecting over the summer when they were spotted at Kreation Organic Juicery in West Hollywood with Jenn sporting a baby bump.

 'We are feeling blessed and full of love with the arrival of our beautiful baby girl, Sovereign Bo Raymond. 'Isn't She lovely' by Stevie Wonder on repeat,' he penned in the caption.

A source close to the couple confirmed the exciting news at the time to Us Weekly, adding: 'They are thrilled and very excited.' 

Usher was first seen with Goicoechea last fall, as they put on a cozy display backstage at the Hollywood Bowl.

The couple later attended Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs' star-studded 50th birthday together in December. 

He previously married his manager and long-time girlfriend Grace Miguel, 51, in September of 2015, before announcing their split in March of 2018.

The Hard II Love artist and Miguel told Us Weekly at the time: 'After much thought and consideration we have mutually decided to separate as a couple.  

'We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives. The enormous amount of love and respect that we have for each other will only increase as we move forward.'

Before that, he was married to his former personal stylist Tameka Foster, 49, from 2007 to 2009.
