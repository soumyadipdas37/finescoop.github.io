Expecting: The athlete, who is also mum to daughter Summer, five, was every inch the natural beauty as she posed for the snap, captioned: 'Bumping along nicely. 17 weeks'

The athlete, who is also mum to daughter Summer, five, was every inch the natural beauty as she posed for the snap, captioned: 'Bumping along nicely. 17 weeks.' 

Styling her sleek blonde locks into a side parting, Rebecca accentuated her sun-kissed glow with a hint of pink gloss and a flick of mascara on her fluttery eyelashes. 

The award-winning swimmer opted for minimal jewellery and wore a fitness tracker with a purple strap on her wrist. 

Big news: Rebecca announced she was pregnant with her second child earlier this month, in a sweet snap shared to Instagram with her daughter Summer, five, and her boyfriend Andrew Parsons

Earlier this month Rebecca announced she was pregnant by posting a sweet snap of herself and her boyfriend Andrew Parsons, 30, holding up an ultrasound. 

Revealing she is 14 weeks pregnant, Rebecca appeared to suggest she conceived during the COVID-19 lockdown. 

She captioned the snap: 'Andy and I are excited to announce that we’re expecting. Summer can’t wait, she asks everyday to check my belly to see if it’s growing.

'Going to be a long wait until the end of Feb!'  

She also added an adorable snap of Summer, holding the sonogram, wearing a 'Promoted To Big Sister' top. 

Rebecca and Harry Needs, 28, married in 2014, welcoming Summer in 2015. They split, however, in 2015.

Harry came out as bisexual in June this year, and told BBC News that he entered into a relationship with another man in 2019 and said he didn't feel he could truly say he was bisexual until this happened.   

In a recent interview with HELLO!, the Olympian said her daughter 'loved' spending rare quality time with her and Harry, gushing: 'She gets the best of both worlds!'

The swimmer credited the coronavirus lockdown for forming a solid routine, with their little girl spending three days each at their respective homes.

Rebecca said: 'She goes to Harry's for three days, she comes to mine for three days. We have co-parented really well and found our routine. She gets the best of both worlds!'
