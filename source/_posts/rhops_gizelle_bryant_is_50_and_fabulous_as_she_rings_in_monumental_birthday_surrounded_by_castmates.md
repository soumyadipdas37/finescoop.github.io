Despite the pandemic Gizelle safely gathered with her fellow castmates for her big day in a chic pink room.

She looked stunning in a skin tight orange dress with a clear face shield as she wore her blonde tresses up in a stylish ponytail.

Gizelle glowed as she prepared to cut her three tiered forest green birthday cake adorned with cascading pink flowers.
