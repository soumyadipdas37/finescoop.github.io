The price of methamphetamine has tripled on Australia's east coast as coronavirus border restrictions increasingly put the squeeze on drug syndicates.  

Daily Mail Australia understands the cost has jumped from $200 a gram before the pandemic to $600 today.

And the shortage of supply is having a serious knock-on effect.

Pushers of the dangerous and illegal substance have turned to 'stepping on' the product with cutting agents to keep up with demand and generate more illegal profits. 

But the diminished quality and soaring prices may be driving ice users toward other drugs, such as prescription opiates.

What's causing the price rise is not clear, but it's suspected that criminal syndicates are struggling to bring in precursor chemicals such as pseudoephedrine.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison shut down in-and-outbound travel in March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Although the border lockdown has not impacted cargo shipments from overseas, there appears to be less pseudoephedrine flowing into the country from the precursor chemical hotspots like China and southeast Asia.

While the Australian Federal Police, Border Force, NSW Police and the Australian Institute of Criminology would not comment on the issue, it emerged last week that the price of ice had also tripled in Western Australia.

'Border restrictions have cut off the supply of methamphetamines and also increased price,' Tom Sullivan from the Australian Institute of Criminology told 6PR radio station.

'The consequences were a reduction in availability, and the cost of methamphetamines was three times higher than it was at the beginning of the year.

Mr Sullivan fears the under-strain drug market could also see drug addicts overdosing if it suddenly 'bounces back'.

'There are implications for those not expecting to reduce their use and they may be involuntarily abstaining from methamphetamines which could lower their tolerance,' he said.

Another knock-on effect of the soaring cost of ice is the potential for drug users to opt for prescription opiates which are still coming into the country uninterrupted.

Police raided 23 properties across Perth last week, bringing charges against 27 people.

Operation Zulu was prompted by a spate of suspected fatal overdoses in Western Australia.

'There is some suggestion that other drugs like fentanyl are now being used to enhance heroin, creating a potential for further complications and overdoses,' Det-Supt Tony Longhorn told the West Australian.

'When drug users switch from using a synthetic stimulant, like meth, to a powerful opioid depressant, such as heroin, and have no awareness as to the purity of the substance, there is a significant risk of accidental overdose which can lead to death.'

Despite similar fears on Australia's east coast, NSW Health told Daily Mail Australia there is 'no data to suggest an increase in opioid use or overdoses during COVID'.
