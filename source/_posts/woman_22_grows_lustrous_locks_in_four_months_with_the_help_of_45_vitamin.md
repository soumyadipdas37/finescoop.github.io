An Australian woman who experienced 'constant' hair loss has grown lustrous locks in the space of four months after using one $45 vitamin - and she's not the only one.

Lisa, 22, from Melbourne, started taking nutritionist Jessica Sepel's $44.99 Hair + Energy tablets in May this year after noticing a lot of her favourite beauty gurus on social media were sharing them in 'non sponsored posts'. 

'At the beginning of the year I was using other hair growth tablets and didn't notice any changes,' she told FEMAIL.

Lisa, 22, from Melbourne, started taking nutritionist Jessica Sepel's $44.99 Hair + Energy tablets in May this year (four months hair growth difference) 

The JSHealth Hair + Energy Vitamins ($44.99)

'I wasn't super optimistic my hair would ever grow and stop falling out. I would go to the hairdressers regularly and purchase good quality products but no major change occurred with them either.

'My hair still fell out ALL THE TIME and in relatively big chunks, it was still dry and would snap so easily.'

So, Lisa turned to Jessica Sepel's vitamins for help in May, although she was 'super inconsistent' with taking them originally. 

When isolation in Melbourne moved to stage four Lisa ensured she was taking the Hair and Energy tablets religiously once a day, and has noticed a significant improvement since.

Miss Sepel (pictured) recommends taking one capsule a day with breakfast and to store the bottle in a cool, dry place that doesn't heat up beyond 25 degrees

'Whilst I have been on the tablets I have noticed my hair is thicker, lusciously soft and definitely longer. Plus I've noticed it isn't breaking as much as what it used to,' she said.

'The JSHealth H+E Vitamins contain zinc which helps to maintain normal healthy hair, skin and nails,' the website read. 

The capsules also contain a therapeutic dose of iodine from kelp which helps to restore hair strength and volume which naturally supports hair growth.

When it comes to boosting your energy, iodine is essential for the manufacturing of thyroid hormones that regulate metabolism and energy production throughout the body. 

Another lady shared photos of her husband's scalp, saying that he was 'very happy' after seeing hair growth between August 5 and August 22

'My mum has a bald patch and has tried all of the topical antibiotics, steroid injections, been to multiple dermatologists and all of them have said she would never see hair growth on the hairless patch again,' one woman said

So not only do the vitamins increase hair volume but the customer will get an additional boost of liveliness by taking the tablets as well.

Other customers with bald patches have also raved about the range, saying it filled in their sparseness in weeks.

'My mum has a bald patch and has tried all of the topical antibiotics, steroid injections, been to multiple dermatologists and all of them have said she would never see hair growth on the hairless patch again,' one woman said.

'She took your vitamins for a month and there is hair growing on the bald spot for the first time in five years.'
