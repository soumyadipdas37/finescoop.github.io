Scent-training honey bees as if they're dogs can help boost crop production by up to 57 per cent, scientists say.

Researchers in Argentina found that exposing bees to foods scented with synthetic sunflower odour altered their choices about which plants to visit later.

Exposure to the scent of sunflowers created 'bee memories' that influenced the insects to seek out sunflowers and bring back more sunflower pollen to their hives. 

The discovery could have a global impact by increasing not only flower yields, but also food crops like almonds, apples and pears.

'We show that it's possible to condition honeybees to a rewarded odour inside the colony, and this experience modifies the bees' odour-guided behaviours later,' said Dr Walter Farina of Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

'The most surprising and relevant result is that the foraging preferences for the target crop are so prolonged and intensive that it promoted significant increases in the crop yields.'

The growing global demand for pollination leads producers to consider new strategies in pollinator management, Dr Farina claims.

Training bees like dogs may be the answer if bee keepers want to pick and choose what type of crop they'll pollinate.

Bees generally can learn scents inside the nest – when scented food from successful foragers is unloaded and distributed among nest mates, for example. 

'Such social learning is key for adaptive collective responses, as it enables workers to acquire information about different foraging options,' the researchers say in their study paper.  

To demonstrate bee memories and their response to training, the scientists selected sunflower – an economically important and pollinator-dependent crop. 

Researchers developed a simple synthetic mixture that the bees associated with the natural floral scent of sunflowers and combined this with bee food – in this case, a simple sucrose solution. 

'We aimed to develop a simple but representative synthetic mimic odor that bees could not discriminate from the natural fragrance of sunflower inflorescence, and it is not difficult to produce,' Dr Farina told MailOnline.

The synthetic odour was chosen over a natural one for the experiments because the real biological material can quickly deteriorate.

Synthetic odour also promotes the release of chemicals commonly not found in the natural bouquet of the actual flower, Dr Farina pointed out. 

Honey bee colonies were fed 1,000ml of the solution, placed in their hives for two days.  

The man-made hives were then moved to line up along a field of sunflower crops before being released.

The bees' training positively affected the density of bees on the crop and made them bring more sunflower pollen back to the hive. 

This increased visitation also boosted flower production by somewhere between 29 to 57 per cent, depending on the sunflower hybrid grown. 

While bees would have been inclined to pollinate the crops at some point due to their proximity, the bees were quicker to reach the crops after getting a sniff of the synthetic odour – and in high density too. 

'After moving at a new environment, the honeybees need time to know the new surroundings, and days later they initiate the foraging activity on the crop,' Dr Farina told MailOnline.

The bees' foraging preferences were also indicated by their 'waggle dances' while inside the hive. 

Honeybees use waggle dances to communicate to their nest mates the distance and direction to food sources.  

Waggle dances indicating the sunflower plot occurred earlier bee colonies fed the synthetic sunflower solution – within the first hour of having relocated the hive near the sunflower plantation. 

'We recorded waggle dances not in commercial beehives but in observation hives with transparent glass walls,' Dr Farina said. 

'So, we can observe and record the in hive behaviors, the waggle dance being a very conspicuous display.' 

The results of the study highlight the role of olfactory learning within the social context of the hive to 'bias' foraging preferences. 

'Through this procedure, it is possible to bias honeybee foraging activity and increase yields significantly,' Dr Farina said. 

'In other words, pollination services might be improved in pollinator-dependent crops by using simple mimic odors as part of a precision pollination strategy.'

Dr Farina's team had previously shown that honeybees could establish stable and long-term memory related to food scents inside the nest.  

Now the team know in-hive odor memories enhance the guiding process toward the learned stimuli. 

The researchers say they are now studying other pollinator-dependent crops, including almonds, pears, and apples. 

Ultimately, their goal is to develop an array of odour mimics to improve pollination efficiency of important agricultural crops.

The research has been published in the journal Current Biology.   

Bees in a colony work with each other to gather food. 

They try to find the most pollen and nectar in the least amount of time possible.

Some flowers have more pollen and nectar than others. 

When a good flower patch is found, bees recruit other bees from their colony to the patch.  

To tell those bees where to find the best flowers, bees communicate flower location using special dances inside the hive. 

One bee dances, while other bees watch to learn the directions to a specific flower patch. 

The waggle dance tells the watching bees two things about a flower patch’s location - the distance and the direction away from the hive. 

Distance 

The dancing bee waggles back and forth as she moves forward in a straight line, then circles around to repeat the dance. 

The length of the middle line, called the waggle run, shows roughly how far it is to the flower patch.

Direction 

Bees know which way is up and which way is down inside their hive, and they use this to show direction. 

To do this, bees dance with the waggle run at a specific angle. 

Outside the hive, bees look at the position of the sun, and fly at the very same angle that they've just observed, going away from the sun. 

If the sun were in a different position, the angle would stay the same, but the direction to the correct flower patch would be different. 

Round dance 

A round dance tells the watching bees only one thing about the flower patch’s location - that it is somewhere close to the hive. 

This dance does not include a waggle run, or any information about the direction of the flower patch.

In this dance, the bee walks in a circle, turns around, then walks the same circle in the opposite direction. 

She repeats this many times. 

Sometimes, the bee includes a little waggle as she’s turning around.

The duration of this waggle is thought to indicate the quality of the flower patch she has found.
