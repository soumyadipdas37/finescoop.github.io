A murderer and once broke out of prison has been busted throwing his own faeces at two jail guards.    

Jason John Nixon, 50, was handed an indefinite prison sentence in 2004 after killing two fellow inmates at the Brisbane Correctional Centre in the city's southwest.  

He also gained infamy for breaking out of the maximum security unit and attempting to murder one of the detectives who recaptured him, The Courier Mail reported.   

Convicted murderer Jason John Nixon (pictured), 50, faced Brisbane Magistrate's Court on Monday after throwing his own faeces at two prison guards last October 

Nixon, who earned his nickname 'Waxy' because of his love of surfing, beat fellow inmate Bart Vosmaer to death with gym weights as part of a group murder in 1993.  

He broke out of the prison alongside 'Postcard Bandit' Brenden Abbott in 1997 and fired at shotgun at the detective who recaptured him at a luxury Sunshine Coast resort. 

Nixon was hit with his indefinite jail term after brutally killing double murderer Mark Day in the prison exercise yard in 2003.  

Nixon has since faced court over a number of assaults on prison guards and appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. 

He appeared via video link from jail and pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully assaulting prison guards last October.  

Police prosecutor Lauren Collins said Nixon had moved to the back of his cell before throwing faeces at the two correctional officers who delivered his lunch. 

'At approximately 12.05pm on October 29, 2019 the victims were delivering lunches to the prisoners within the correctional centre,' Sergeant Collins said.

Nixon infamously murdered two fellow inmates and has also escaped from the Brisbane Correctional Centre (pictured) 

'The defendant has taken his food box and then rushed back towards the open hatch and has thrown faeces at the victims hitting them on the chest and face area.' 

Sergeant Collins also said Nixon had six pages of 'detestable criminal history' and similar offences. 

The incidents included Nixon throwing urine at a jail nurse and leaving a 20cm gouge in a guard's arm after attacking him with a razor blade.

Magistrate Penelope Hay said Nixon's offending was serious and urged him to consider his eligibility for parole in 2034. 

Nixon told Magistrate Hay he had 'nothing to say about it'. 

'It's all over. Thanks for being optimistic though, Judge,' he said. 

The 50-year-old was sentenced to two years imprisonment on top of his indefinite sentence.
