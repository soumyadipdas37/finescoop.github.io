Ant and Dec have revealed that owning a £35,000 racehorse with Simon Cowell was 'awful'.  

The Britain's Got Talent duo, both 44, claimed the colt - which they bought together in 2013 - wasn't even a thoroughbred but just a normal horse. 

In an online chat to promote their new book, Once Upon A Tyne, Dec said: 'It was awful, it was a dreadfully slow horse. It wasn't a racehorse it was just a horse, 'cos it didn't race.

'Every time we got to the BGT studio Simon would say, 'I keep paying stable fees on this horse, but I've never seen it run'.'

They also said that Simon originally wanted to name the animal after himself, but they eventually settled on It's A Yes From Me. 

Revealing its eventual fate, Dec mused: 'I think it got rehomed.'

The pair are currently celebrating their 30-year career in television with the release of their book Once Upon A Tyne.

Sharing an insight into their new project earlier this month Ant said: 'We wanted it to be like a conversation and us talking through a story. Every chapter will be about a show we work on and the backstage stories of them.' 

On their time in the spotlight, Dec said: 'It feels like it's gone in the blink of an eye. It bizarrely feels like we're only getting started. I don't think you ever feel like, 'oh I've made it.'

'There is an element that someone will knock on the door and say that well it was meant to be for someone else and we go, "oh, okay."

'We love it, we're very lucky to be involved in three of the biggest shows on TV. We love working together, we love each other and being together and working together.'

The TV stars also revealed during a rare interview on This Morning that they're tested for coronavirus every four days in order to present their much-loved shows together.

The pair kicked off their segment by hugging on air as they explained why they don't need to keep a social distance from each other. 

Removing their protective face masks, Dec shared: 'We don't need these with each other. We're in a cohort!', while Ant added: 'We're working on BGT and other things so we get tested every four or five days so.

'We form a cohort with our households. We have to be careful of where we go and who we see. Nothing new there!'
