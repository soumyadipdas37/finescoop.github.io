Just before the highly-anticipated Netflix series Ratched debuts, Sarah Paulson clarified how to pronounce the title character.

Series creator Ryan Murphy took to Instagram on Thursday night, using 12 separate Instagram posts to create a new poster for Ratched, a prequel which explores the Nurse Ratched character from the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, adapted from Ken Kesey's novel.

Some of those posts had a secret video message behind it from some of the cast members, with Paulson revealing precisely how to pronounce the title character.

'Hello. I'm Sarah Paulson. Today is Ratched premiere day. Ratchet. Ratched. Ratchet. Ratched. Ratchet. How would you say it? She says Mildred ‘Ratchet. I don’t say Mildred Ratched, even though that’s really how it’s spelled,' Paulson revealed.

She added that the pronunciation of her title character's name lead to a 'funny little anecdote' from the production.

'Very early on in shooting, we were shooting a scene in the nurse's lounge, where Mildred meets Gwendoline (Cynthia Nixon), and you'll come to find very quickly that story becomes one of my most cherished parts of this story, and I can't wait for you guys to see that,' she said.

Sarah's message: 'Hello. I'm Sarah Paulson. Today is Ratched premiere day. Ratchet. Ratched. Ratchet. Ratched. Ratchet. How would you say it? She says Mildred ‘Ratchet. I don’t say Mildred Ratched, even though that’s really how it’s spelled,' Paulson revealed

'I had to shoot a scene where I had to tell Gwendoline that bologna is my favorite food, and that is not an easy thing,' she added. 

The collage also features a 'secret' video from Finn Wittrock, who plays Edmund Tolleson in the series.

'Hello everybody, I am Finn Wittrock. I am so excited for Ratched premiere day. I can't wait for you to see this project that we've been working so had on,' he said.

He added that one of the first shots of the show is a 'winding road of these cars going down and it's really perilous and it's really dangerous and you don't know where it's going to go, and, to me, that's the whole show.'

There is also a brief video from Jon Jon Briones, who plays Dr. Richard Hanover, who welcomes fans to 'Ratched premiere day.'

'We had so much fun filming the show, and the cast became really good friends and you can tell by the way we treated each other in the show,' Briones added.
