Natalie Portman arrived in Sydney, Australia on Tuesday to begin filming the highly-anticipated Marvel Studios movie Thor: Love and Thunder.

The actress exited a luxury private jet and deplaned onto the tarmac, flanked by her her children, daughter Amalia, 3 and son, Aleph, 9.  

First off the plane was little Aleph who appeared to be carrying a box or suitcase of some sort.

Next was Natalie, weighed down with a large tote bag and a pink carry on case. 

The 39-year-old dutifully hoisted small suitcases, seemingly belonging to her little ones, down the stairway. 

Amalia trotted after her mother, with Natalie reaching her hand out to help the toddler, who was dressed in bright pink.

Lastly an unidentified male, perhaps a security staffer, carried a number of bags down to a waiting van, which the family entered. 

The family were helped by staff at the airport, who wore face masks while assisting them. 

Natalie will be playing The Mighty Thor in the highly-anticipated Marvel Studios movie Thor: Love and Thunder.

The actress revealed at San Diego Comic-Con last year that she will return as Jane Foster in Thor: Love and Thunder. 

She will become The Mighty Thor, following a 2015 comic book arc where Foster wields the mystical hammer Mjolnir and becomes The Mighty Thor.       

The star made her Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in 2011's Thor as Jane Foster, a scientist who became Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) love interest.

She returned in 2013's Thor: The Dark World, though she did not star in 2017's Thor: Ragnarok.

Last month, the Black Swan actress also celebrated eight years of marriage with Benjamin Millepied, 43. 

In a sweet Instagram post shared to mark their eighth anniversary she posted a fuzzy image from their nuptials, showing her smiling with her arms around the handsome Frenchman. 

'Still my favorite dance partner. #8years' Portman captioned the throwback snap.

Benjamin and Natalie met on the set of Darren Aronofsky's searing psychological dance drama Black Swan in 2010.
