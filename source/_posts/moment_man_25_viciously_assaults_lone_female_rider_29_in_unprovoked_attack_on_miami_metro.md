A Miami metro rider has been caught on camera viscously assaulting a lone female traveler kicking, punching and slamming her head in an unprovoked, random attack.

Joshua James King, 25, is accused of beating up Andrea Puerta, 29, during the incident on September 4, leaving her with a concussion, a broken rib and bruising. 

Surveillance footage shows as the man, identified by police as King, walks onto the metro before launching the sustained attack on Puerta. The clip shows as he punches her more than 20 times. 

Puerta told Local 10: 'I remember that I closed my hands and I said, "stop, stop". He did not stop. There was a moment when he said, "Sorry" and I looked at him and he punched me and after that, I don’t know what happened.' 

She said of her attacker: 'I’ve never seen him in my life. I never know him until that moment.' 

After passing out Puerta managed to get up and leave the train before calling 911, footage shows.  Her attacker remains on the metro; he is said to have assaulted two more men later that same day.
