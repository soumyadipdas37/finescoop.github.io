A woman who merged in front of truck on a busy Sydney road filed an insurance claim within an hour claiming she was not at fault.

But dashcam footage posted to the Road Trains Australia Facebook page shows the sedan turning straight in front of the long haul vehicle on the Captain Cook Bridge in Taren Point. 

The manager of truck company Ross Transport, True Ross, told Daily Mail Australia the incident highlights what heavy vehicle drivers are dealing with on a daily basis.

The car driver blamed the truck for the accident and Mr Ross received a phone call from their insurance company within one hour requesting a hire car and urging Ross Transport to admit fault for the collision. 

'When the third party insurance company rang we told them what had happened and they said they are still holding us at fault as that is not their clients version of events - their client told them our vehicle had rear ended them,' Mr Ross said.

Luckily, the video footage showed what really happened.      

'They then set us a letter of demand but once we sent them the footage they accepted liability,' Mr Ross said.   

'It was pretty clear who was at fault to everyone but the car driver.'

'Thank goodness for our cameras for evidence and proof for our drivers.' 

Mr Ross said some motorists just don't realise how dangerous their actions can be on the road, especially when in close proximity to heavy vehicles.  

'What this car driver doesn't realise, is how lucky she is to be alive, making a silly decision like this,' he said.

'She was lucky there was no other cars on the right hand side and she did not end up between the dog trailer and the truck.'

Other members of the Facebook group offered their support to truck drivers who have to put up with dangerous motorists everyday. 

'To many car drivers out there full of self importance and no consideration for other road users,' one user wrote.

'I see so many near misses daily, I take my hat off to most truck drivers cause if they weren't as switched on and good at their job there would be a hell of a lot more fatalities.'

Another said: 'All drivers should be taught more info on heavy vehicles so they're more aware.'

'Truck simulators wouldn’t go astray during testing either, that way they get a idea of how many blind spots they have and also how long it takes to pull them up.'
