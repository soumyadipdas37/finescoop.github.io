Footy WAG Rebecca Judd has been left gobsmacked after hearing an Australian nanny's wild confession about what it was like to work for a rich family in the UK. 

Appearing on The 3pm Pick Up this Tuesday, the nanny explained that the parents seemed normal when she was first hired to care for their eight-month-old child. 

However, things quickly took a bizarre turn when the child started to eat solid foods. 

'They first started telling me to wash all the vegetables with Evian water': Footy WAG Rebecca Judd, 37, was left gobsmacked during Tuesday's 3pm Pick Up after hearing an Australian nanny's wild confession about working for a rich family in the UK 

'[The parents] first started telling me to wash all [the baby's] vegetables with Evian water. and they started really emphasising the bottled water over the London tap water,' she explained. 

The woman admitted she'd found the request 'a bit weird' at first, but decided to let it slide as the London tap water 'is a bit gross'. 

However, things took a turn for the bizarre when it came to bath time.

'But then when it came to doing the bath routine, they instructed me to fill up an entire baby bath with nine 1.25 litre bottles of Evian water,' she said. 

Shocked, Rebecca's co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond exclaimed: 'That's quite extreme. Definitely first child,' to which the woman laughed: 'Quite expensive as well. First child, yes.'

Mother-of-four Rebecca interjected: 'Rather spoiled, we're thinking?'

'Rather spoiled, we're thinking?' Rebecca was shocked by the nanny's confession. Pictured: Rebecca poses inside her $7.3 million Melbourne mansion with husband Chris Judd share their four children, son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, five, and twin sons Tom and Darcy, three

Some of the world's biggest celebrities have admitted to bathing in Evian mineral water. 

In 2005, tennis champion Serena Williams famously enjoyed a bath filled with over 1000 litres of Evian spring water at Miami's Hotel Victor.  

Costing around $5,000, the experience was dubbed by media at the time as 'the world's most expensive bath'. 

The likes of Britney Spears, Beyonce, and her daughter Blue Ivy have also been rumoured to have indulged in the hotel's exclusive bathing experience.
