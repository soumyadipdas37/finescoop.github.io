Meet the ordinary young Australians who are making a fortune on TikTok and will be transitioning from their bedrooms to billboards and television screens.

From a dancing teen mum to a male make-up artist and street busker, 2020 has spawned a new-wave of celebrities who have rocketed to internet fame while in lockdown. 

These Aussies have quit their jobs and are using TikTok as their main source of income, quickly amassing millions of followers.

Now these normal guys and girls will see their faces, dance moves, tips and tricks transition from phones to televisions after becoming the Aussie faces of TikTok.

Brandon Lee Scott, 25, shot to TikTok stardom just this year after moving back to Australia and says it is 'surreal' being a part of the new ad campaign.

After working in retail in the United Kingdom he decided to start posting his looks online before turning to TikTok.

'A few years ago I was working in retail and I just sort of took a look at my life and thought like "What? What am I doing?",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I enjoyed being in makeup but it didn't feel like it was end game.' 

Since moving home to Australia he turned to TikTok as a way to make social media his full time income and said it is 'the ultimate job'.

'It makes it feel like what I'm doing is making a difference. I feel like I've found a bit of a purpose,' Brandon said.

21-year-old Jasmine had been on the popular app since 2015 and said she stuck it out because she has always been interested in creating videos

Brandon said he likes to keep his content 'fresh and fun' and as an escape during such a challenging time.

'Having that little bit of an escape and just watching something that could take your mind off the news is always good,' he said. 

Brisbane teen mother Sarah Magusara has become the most popular Australian on Tiktok with a gargantuan following of 15.5million.

The 19-year-old dancer born to Filipino parents grew her following by posting stylish outfits, flawless makeup, dances and everyday activities.

It wasn't until she welcomed daughter Zamira Rose with high school boyfriend Pieta Warbrick in September 2019 that she truly began to rise.

Living in Melbourne Jasmine said the app has been really helpful in keeping her distracted during lockdown

Having a baby only catapulted her higher into the stratosphere of social media stardom.

'Young mums started following me and the feedback I received was really positive. I really love how they like my lifestyle,' she told the Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine. 

Meanwhile, 21-year-old Jasmine had been on the popular app since 2015 and said she stuck it out because she has always been interested in creating videos.

'TikTok is my main career but I'm also working in a pharmacy just part time because i've had that job for a few years and I'm a dance teacher as well,' Jasmine said.

'There's not one day that I'm not using TikTok whether it's just consuming content or making videos myself I'm just always on the go with it.' 

Living in Melbourne Jasmine said the app has been really helpful in keeping her distracted during lockdown.

'There’s new videos always going around so it’s cool to have something to focus on during this crazy time.'

Jaycee (pictured with his girlfriend) had built himself a studio and started producing his own music and even pushed out 26 singles and music videos but still only had a few listeners

Whenever she goes out in public the 21-year-old has young fans coming up to her excited to meet her.  

'You've never met someone before, and then you realise that you can have an impact on people's lives without even knowing it.' 

Perth-based rapper Jaycee had been working on his music his entire life trying to break out into the music world, but it wasn't until he started posting to TikTok that he finally got the attention he wanted.

'I was busking on the streets and then TikTok came along and changed the game,' the 22-year-old told Daily Mail Australia.

Jaycee had built himself a studio and started producing his own music and even pushed out 26 singles and music videos but still only had a few listeners.

Then he started taking his remixes to TikTok and woke up one day with 100,000 followers - some of which he included in a music video.

He now has a deal with a record label and is planning to release even more music with the help of his followers. 

'I knew the whole time that TIkTok was like the future,' Jaycee said.

'My life is my work - it's not a job for me, TikTok is my job, my music is my job.'

'I enjoy making content, it's not hard for me to do.'  

These young Aussies will now fill TV screens across the country in what is TikTok's largest ever ad campaign.
