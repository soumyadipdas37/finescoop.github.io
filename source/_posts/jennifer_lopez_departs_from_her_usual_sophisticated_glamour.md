Her sophisticated sense of style has won more plaudits than her decades spanning music career, but Jennifer Lopez appeared to take a rare misstep this week thanks to a consistently poor run of outfits. 

More familiar with tailored trouser-suits than tie-dye two-pieces, Jennifer suggested her stylist was taking a post-lockdown break after venturing out in a series of surprisingly unflattering ensembles - including the latter.  

But it doesn't end there; chunky knitwear, shapeless slacks and a risky take on the divisive double denim look have all featured during four consecutive appearances in New York City.

Stepping out on Monday the Latina star opted for an unflattering $38 white cleavage-boosting Naked Wardrobe 'Hourglass' bodysuit while joining her younger sister Lynda for lunch in Manhattan's West Village neighborhood.   

She added to the look with a pair of ill-fitting check trouser that caught the eye as they settled own for an al fresco meal.  

Later that day she raised eyebrows in a notably garish hooded top and matching joggers as she rented one of the city's environmentally conscious Citi Bikes.

Risky: The following day she ventured into territory most fashionistas dare not tread by selecting a triple denim outfit ahead of a night out with fiancé Alex Rodriguez

Adorned with clashing yellow, pink and blue shades, the two-piece ensured she stood out, perhaps for all the wrong reasons, while mingling with pedestrians.

The following day she ventured into territory most fashionistas dare not tread by selecting a triple denim outfit ahead of a night out with  fiancé Alex Rodriguez. 

Jennifer's look could not be missed as she modeled a denim jacket over a denim bustier as the couple dined out at Manhattan's Carbone Restaurant.

Misfire: On Tuesday the singer and actress continued a recurring theme by wearing another questionable ensemble, this time a dowdy knit cardigan and shapeless slacks

On Tuesday the singer and actress continued a recurring theme by wearing another questionable ensemble, this time a dowdy knit cardigan and shapeless slacks. 

The Hustlers star adopted the casual look while out in Tribeca for an early evening dinner with her fiancé, who looked dashing in a dark suit.

The outing came the same day that the couple renewed their push to buy the New York Mets by indicating the actress would be the controlling figure if they won, rather than her future husband.

The good old days: Jennifer is usually more familiar with tailored trouser-suits than tie-dye two-pieces
