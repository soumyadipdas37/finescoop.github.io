An Australian mother-of-three has turned a small market stall in Byron Bay into a multimillion-dollar tea company with the help of Facebook promoted ads.

Jordana Edwards, 39, launched Clean Tea in 2013 with her mother, who works as a naturopath and medical herbalist. The pair curated three different tea flavours at the time.

'It was born from a desire to combine my love for tea and my yearning for a clean, organic and chemical-free lifestyle,' the entrepreneur told FEMAIL.

'It was born from a desire to combine my love for tea and my yearning for a clean, organic and chemical-free lifestyle,' the entrepreneur told FEMAIL

'After the birth of my second baby and living in a small rural town, there was not a lot of work available. Starting my market stall in Byron Bay seemed like the easiest way to earn an income and introduce our teas to consumers.' 

The brand went on to create a 'sample' box of teas that saw an increase in sales of 2,000 per cent overnight, and now they sell lots of custom 'boxes' for every occasion.

'From birthday boxes to get well soon boxes, our simple message to our customers is "We hope you find joy in every cup". We have sent thousands of gift boxes all over Australia during the pandemic with handwritten gift notes sharing love and thoughts,' Jordana said.

The Bestie Box and Care Box ($29.90) are the two most popular boxes today and the distinctive Blue Byron colour changing tea (from $12.50) is the most purchased drink.

A $20 boosted post on Facebook in 2015 saw sales skyrocket again by over 2,283 per cent, and the team realised the power of ads to reach new customers. 

Facebook ads have generated over $2.1million in sales so far and the brand generates $150,000 a month.  

During the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 50 tea blends to Clean Tea's name, Jordana launched a second 'sister' company, calling it The Breastfeeding Tea Co.

After giving birth to her third baby, who suffered terribly from colic and reflux, Jordana and her mother created a 'colic tea'.

'The tea was a huge success, with thousands and thousands of mothers finding relief with this pure tea that reduces wind and pain in the baby,' she said.

'At one stage, when the product was almost 70 per cent of sales at Clean Tea, we decided the tea had more opportunity to help women both in Australia and worldwide with its dedicated brand and website.'

They worked for six months on creating The Breastfeeding Tea Co, drawing on many learnings from Clean Tea, to create a brand dedicated to breastfeeding mothers. 

The result was a simple yet effective range of breastfeeding safe teas including colic tea ($20), lactation tea ($20) and mama tea ($16), plus a deluxe breastfeeding box ($48) with all three.

Since the launch of The Breastfeeding Tea Co and the subsequent growth of Clean Tea, Jordana has seen a 110 per cent increase in sales

'The Breastfeeding Tea Co is my passion project; truly nothing makes me happier as a business owner to know we are helping women through this important and often challenging time of their life,' Jordana said.

'We are proud to be helping small babies with wind, pain and discomfort, one cup of tea at a time.'  

Since the launch of The Breastfeeding Tea Co and the subsequent growth of Clean Tea, Jordana has seen a 110 per cent increase in sales.  

The team are looking forward to selling their Christmas tea boxes at the end of the year, and are excited to create more blends in 2021. 

'Christmas 2020 will be very different this year in Australia, and demand is already starting for our delicious Christmas teas and Christmas boxes,' she said.

'Our most popular box of 2019, the Teacher Gift Box will also be back, an opportunity to thank your child's teacher for an unprecedented year.'
