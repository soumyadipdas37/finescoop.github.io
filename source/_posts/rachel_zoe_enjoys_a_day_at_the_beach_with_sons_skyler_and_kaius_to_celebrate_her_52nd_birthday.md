Rachel Zoe celebrated her 52nd birthday in style on Monday, by enjoying a family outing at the beach.

The fashion designer was sure to turn heads as she stepped out for a day at the beach with her sons Skyler Morrison, nine, and Kaius Jagger, six, in Los Angeles.

Showing off her sartorial prowess during the outing, Rachel looked sensational in a colourful kaftan that had a quirky print.

Rachel's ensemble fit loosely on her slender frame, and billowed around her as she strolled along the beach with her little ones.

Her golden locks were brushed into loose waves that cascaded over her shoulders, and she looked fresh-faced as she went make-up free.

The fashion mogul accessorised her look by wearing a pair of chic aviator shades and an array of silver chain necklaces.

Rachel recently celebrated 29 years with her husband Rodger Berman at the swanky Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Santa Barbara, California.

Rachel began dating Rodger while attending college in Washington, D.C. in 1991, followed by their wedding in 1996.

At the time they first met, Rodger thought Rachel was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.

He told Harper's Bazaar in 2011: 'I met Rachel in the summer of 1991. She was 19, and I was 22. 

'She was a restaurant hostess, and I was working as a waiter in Washington, D.C., where we both attended college,

'I vividly remember the first time I saw her, wearing a tight black minidress, high-heeled pumps, stick-straight hair, and big red lips covered in M.A.C. Chili lipstick (her trademark). 

'She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I quickly learned that she also had more clothes than any woman I had ever seen. I often wondered if she'd ever do an outfit change mid-date.' 

Marking the special occasion on her Instagram account, Rachel shared a throwback of herself flashing her diamond engagement ring while snuggled up to her husband.

'This is us. Me and my ❤️ @rbermanus long ago..and today we celebrate #29 years together on our official #firstdate #anniversary xoRZ,' she captioned the photo.
