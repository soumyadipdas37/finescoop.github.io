A carefree Michael Cohen was spotted strolling around Central Park as he serves out the remainder of his three-year prison sentence at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.  

President Donald Trump's former fixer and personal lawyer stepped out on Friday morning for a walking around the park near his home on the Upper East Side, as seen in photos obtained by DailyMail.com.

Cohen traded his usual suit-and-tie ensemble for a more casual look with jeans, a baby blue polo, a zip-up hoodie and a black mask pushed down under his chin as he sat on a bench taking phone calls.  

The 54-year-old - who is serving the last two years of his prison sentence for lying to Congress, tax evasion and campaign finance violations on 'home confinement' - has only been sighted a few times since he was released from custody in July.  

However, he's remained very much in the public eye as he promotes his bombshell book about his time working for Trump, titled Disloyal, and his podcast, Mea Culpa.

Cohen served a year of his prison sentence behind bars at Otisville Federal Correctional Institute in upstate New York before he was sent home on furlough due to the coronavirus pandemic in May.  

He was shackled again on July 9 after he questioned a home detention agreement that barred him from publishing his book, engaging with news organizations and posting on social media. 

Cohen walked free for a second time on July 24 after a judge ruled that the agreement violated his first amendment rights.  

He came under fire later that month after he was spotted dining out at his favorite Upper East Side restaurants, Avra and Le Bilboquet, causing many to charge that his at-home confinement wasn't strict enough. 

However, Cohen's lawyers insisted that the outings did not violate the terms of his furlough agreement.

Prosecutors did not release the full agreement, but its understood to include electronic surveillance to ensure that Cohen remains within a certain geographic area around his home.  

For the past few months Cohen has kept a much lower profile with less flashy activities like his Central Park trip on Friday morning.

For much of his walk, Cohen's eyes were glued on his cellphone. At one point he passed by the same area where pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew were seen strolling back in 2010.  

The disgraced Trump fixer has spent the majority of his furlough time hunkered down in his Park Avenue apartment, where he's filmed multiple TV interviews about his book, including for NBC's Late Night With Seth Meyers and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show.

Cohen still has plenty of time to fill at home, as his sentence isn't set to expire until November 22, 2021.
