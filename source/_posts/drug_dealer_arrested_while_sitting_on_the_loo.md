This is the moment a drug dealer was arrested while sitting on the loo as police raided his home in Peru.   

The accused, identified as Jose Spencer Bilbao Rivers, was apprehended by police while he was sitting relieving himself in a small white bucket.

Police had raided his home in the capital city of Lima, Peru, where they discovered large quantities of Class A drug cocaine.

The man, who is known by the alias ‘Old Toad’, 39, was discovered on the first floor of his home.

He claimed that he was suffering from diarrhoea and did not know there were drugs being prepared for sale in his property.

The man pleaded ignorance despite the fact that police had been recording him allegedly selling drugs.

Cops claim he was preparing bags of cocaine on the ground floor and only fled upstairs when he heard them breaking in.

Police had obtained a search warrant for the premises.

At first, the accused denied that the drugs belonged to him, then he admitted to only selling what is left over from his personal use.

He then finally admitted that he has been selling it for several months but claimed that for each bag he makes little more than 4.2 PEN (1 GBP).

It is not known what exact charges the man is facing.
