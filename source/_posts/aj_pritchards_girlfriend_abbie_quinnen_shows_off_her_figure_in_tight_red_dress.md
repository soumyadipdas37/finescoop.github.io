The blonde beauty flashed her toned legs in the asymmetric number which she teamed with strappy black heels and a black over-the-shoulder bag.   

Meanwhile former Strictly star AJ looked smart in a navy blue shirt, dark jeans and black shoes for the night out on the town.

The couple looked in great spirits as they posed for the sweet snaps posted on AJ's Instagram with the simple caption 'Lady in RED'.

Their night out comes as AJ has been tipped to appear on this year's series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

A source told The Sun that the dancer is being lined up for the show which is being held in a castle in Wales this year instead of Australia due to the coronavirus pandemic.  

The source said: 'Strictly would like to think that no one leaves the show and goes on to bigger things, but AJ will be very popular in the jungle and it'll be a good platform for him.

'His deal is all but done and ITV are delighted they've been able to prize him away from their rivals.'

AJ's representatives were contacted by MailOnline for comment at the time. 

Abbie and AJ first got together in 2018 after Abbie auditioned for AJ's Get on the Floor live tour. 

They celebrated their one-year anniversary in April when AJ shared a romantic tribute.

 The hunk penned: 'Your my Super Woman ❤️.. Happy 1 year anniversary ..' [sic] alongside the cute picture taken at their final performance for charity routine Dress Up, Dance, Donate earlier in the month.

Posting a near-identical image to her social media account, blonde beauty Abbie, who sported a superwoman-inspired costume, wrote: 'Happy year anniversary to this special one ❤️.' 

It comes after the star surprised fans by quitting from Strictly in April, revealing he has ambitions to be bigger than Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. 



New venture? Their night out comes as AJ has been tipped to appear on this year's series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!
