Audiences were happy to see the couples of The Block back on the building site after six weeks at home during COVID lockdown. 

But one moment between Daniel Joyce and foreman Keith Schleiger on Tuesday had viewers fuming on social media.

The South-Australian carpenter had asked the foreman to inspect his floor, but instead of giving his approval Keith pointed out that he had 'put on weight'.

Outraged fans: On Tuesday, The Block viewers were left fuming at foreman Keith Schleiger for his 'fat shaming' comments about contestant Daniel Joyce (pictured) 

Fans of the show flocked to Twitter to slam foreman Keith for his comment, including one who wrote: 'Fat shamed? What's Keith's game exactly.' 

'Oh joy and weigh [sic] shaming on tonight's episode,' one wrote, as another said: 'Nice body shaming, Keith! You are a p***k!'

Meanwhile, a fourth added: 'It's 2020, are we still commenting on people's weight?'

Fuming: Fans of the show flocked to Twitter to slam foreman Keith for his comment, including one who wrote, 'Fat shamed? What's Keith's game exactly' 

Another directed their fury at Keith and said: 'Body Shaming is not something I expected from you. 

'Make comment's on yourself and leave personal body comments for others to make for themselves. It's 2020, no place 4 it #theblock.'

Someone else added: 'Commentary on weight when it hasn't been instigated by the person it involves is a no-go zone.'





Angry: Another directed their fury at Keith and said: 'Body Shaming is not something I expected from you. Make comment's on yourself and leave personal body comments for others to make for themselves'

One fan empathised with Daniel, saying: 'Don't worry Daniel Covid lockdown has done a number on my weight too!' 

But another viewer pointed out that Keith's passing comment was all in good fun, and wrote: 'I think Daniel was in the toilet when God was handing out sense of humours.'

The incident happened when Daniel asked Keith to inspect his flooring, but the foreman said it was too early, before going on to add: 'Hey, mate, you've put a bit of weight on.'  

 

No sense of humour? But another viewer pointed out that Keith's passing comment was all in good fun, and wrote: 'I think Daniel was in the toilet when God was handing out sense of humours'

Daniel said: 'Yeah, just a little bit,' he later told a tradie: 'Good old Keith. Didn't miss him, that's for sure.' 

'It really got under my skin straight away,' he later told the producer.

The Block continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine
