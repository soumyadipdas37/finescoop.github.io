 She burst onto the music scene in the 1980s with her hit single So Macho.

And after Sinitta's body helped her shoot to stardom, she proved she very much still has it as she stepped out for a dog walk with her kids on Sunday.

Sinitta looked stunning for the trip as she proved the years have been incredibly kind to her age-defying complexion and physique.

Showcasing the fruits of hard work in the gym, she was donning a crop top beneath a hoodie and loose-fitting black trousers.

Despite treading the dry streets of London, the stunner bizarrely chose to rock a pair of metallic silver wellington boots. 

She wore her hair in sleek lengths and wore neutral make-up to best show off her fresh complexion for her day out with the kids.

The outing comes after Sinitta revealed she caught coronavirus nine days before Britain went into lockdown after a gig in London.

The singer added that her close friend Simon Cowell knew she had become ill because of their 'psychic' connection.

She revealed to the Sunday Mirror: 'I caught the virus after doing a club gig. Next day I felt as if I'd swallowed a packet of razor blades. I was in bed for about a week. I didn't tell Simon I was ill but it wasn't long before he got in touch.'

She continued: 'We speak quite frequently. I didn't call as I didn't want him worried – I thought, "Well, there's nothing he can do".'

However, she went on to reveal that when the music executive, 60, finally got through to the star, he knew she had been ill with the virus.

She shared: 'He told me, "We have this weird connection, I can just tell when something's wrong".''
