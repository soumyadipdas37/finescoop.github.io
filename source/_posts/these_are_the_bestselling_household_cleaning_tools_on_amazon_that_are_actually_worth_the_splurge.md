If you're looking to take your cleaning regime up a notch, Amazon stocks a ton of household cleaning tools that practically clean the kitchen, bathroom and living room for you.

From squeegees and scrubbing brushes to the number one bestselling Flash Speedmop championed by non-other than Instagram cleaning sensation Mrs Hinch herself, even the toughest spots don't stand a chance against these top-rated buys.

Even better, every one of the cleaning tools listed here comes in at under £30.

Mrs Hinch and Twinkle Cleaning Duo have revealed how they use this number one bestselling SonicScrubber Power Cleaning Brush to clean all the annoying nooks and crannies in their homes, including the inside of their washing machine drawer compartment. It will get rid of the gunk in no time.

Forget reaching for an old toothbrush to clean your faucet or grimy grout, this electronic brush is a smart solution and does all the hard work for you thanks to its oscillating head which moves 10,000 times a minute.

The brand claims it 'improves cleaning time by up to 57 per cent' - so it's not surprising the gadget is a big hit with cleaning professionals and has received over 4,000 glowing reviews on Amazon.
