Manchester United have allowed Harry Maguire an extended break before returning for pre-season training.

United players will return this week for medical tests and assessments before resuming their build up to the new campaign. Most are due back on Wednesday but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has told Maguire he can spend more time away as he and his family recover from their ordeal in Mykonos.

Maguire has been in a secret hideaway since launching an appeal against his conviction for assaulting police, resisting arrest and attempted bribery.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer handed Maguire more time after the defender's guilty verdict in Greece

The central defender broke his silence on the incident in an emotional and deeply personal interview with BBC News on Thursday. Maguire was clearly shaken when recounting the events surrounding the brawl which led to his shock arrest.

His legal term have successfully appealed the verdict, a 21-month suspended prison sentence, and the full re-trial will be held at a later date.  

Maguire may have to wait up to two years before his appeal is heard due to a backlog of legal cases in Greece.

The uncertainty concerning Maguire and any potential involvement when tensions flared in Mykonos saw him lose his place in the England squad for the upcoming Nations League clashes.

The guilty verdict pushed Gareth Southgate into removing him from the roster, and it was revealed on Saturday that Wolves stalwart Conor Coady has been handed his maiden international call-up in his place.

England's 25-man group will head to St George's Park on Sunday to undergo coronavirus testing - and they will face Iceland next Saturday before playing Denmark three days later.

Maguire has held talks with Southgate and made himself available for selection in the future.

England are expected to pick Maguire in October after removing him from the current squad

Sportsmail understands the defender will be picked for the next England squad in October - as the court granting him leave to appeal the verdict effectively wipes out his convictions and restarts the legal process.

United have also stood by Maguire, and the club have no plans to strip him of the captain's armband. 

Their start to pre-season has been marred due to the absences of several players, however. Paul Pogba is self-isolating after contracting COVID-19, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in quarantine for 14 days after going on holiday to Dubai.

Nemanja Matic will also have to self-isolate upon his return to the UK after he announced his retirement from international football, meaning he would be subject to UK government travel restrictions.
