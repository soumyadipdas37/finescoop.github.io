Mitchell Barnett is free to play in the NRL finals as he and Tyrone Peachey prepare to enter into conciliation after a league's investigation into an alleged racist incident closed without resolution.

Gold Coast's Peachey claimed Barnett had called him a 'black c***' during their NRL clash last Friday night, which was denied by the Newcastle forward.

The NRL Integrity Unit had spent recent days interviewing both players and others close to the incident, as well as match and club officials, and also reviewed footage and audio of the alleged incident.

However it announced on Tuesday that the investigation, conducted under the Game's Anti-Vilification Code, had not been able to determine whether the comment was made.

'The facts remain contested by each player. In accordance with the provisions of the Code, both players involved will now be referred to a conciliation process,' the NRL said in a statement.

It means Barnett will be free to face South Sydney on Sunday, in the Knights'  elimination final at ANZ Stadium.

A disappointed Peachey took to Instagram following the decision to claim 'he know exactly what he heard' and that is why he reacted a certain way.

'It can be put down to ignorance, heat of the competition or lack of education - either way I won't stand for it.'

He said if Barnett had allegedly said anything else he would not have been offended. 

NRL boss Andrew Abdo said the game would closely monitor the outcome of conciliation.

'Rugby league is an inclusive game and we take our duty of care to all of our players very seriously,' Abdo said.

'It is important that every player feels supported when they make a complaint, and we want to see our players take a leadership role in speaking out.

'It is also important that where there is a dispute as to what has been said, the game has a process designed to bring the parties together to address those matters in an appropriate way.

'My priority right now is monitoring the welfare of both players. I'm hopeful a conciliation meeting will find a resolution that benefits both players.'

The Newcastle Knights declined to comment due to ongoing conciliation when approached by Daily Mail Australia.
