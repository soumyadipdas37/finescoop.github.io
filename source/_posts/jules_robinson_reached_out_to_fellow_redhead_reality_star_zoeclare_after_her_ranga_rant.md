Zoe-Clare McDonald raised eyebrows during this year's Bachelor's premiere after ranting that redheads are often discriminated against.

And it turns out she has support from former Married At First Sight star and fellow redhead, Jules Robinson, who has revealed she reached out to the 23-year-old.

Speaking to podcast, The Babble on Monday, Jules' husband Cam Merchant shared that the two women exchanged words following the episode.

Host, Matty 'J' Johnson asked Cam: 'Did Jules reach out to Zoe-Clare, one of the most infamous redheads we have had on the Bachelor?'  

He went on to explain that after witnessing the infamously dubbed 'ranga rant' Jules got in touch with Zoe-Clare to give her some supportive words.

'She did a Story to say, "I don't know what's happening here, but honey you're gorgeous, and I don't know about you, but redheads are the hottest",' Cam added.   

And while he couldn't remember if Zoe-Clare replied, he did add that Jules was 'in her corner'.

Shortly after her arrival on this year's Bachelor, Zoe-Clare went on a lengthy rant about how redheads are regularly discriminated against.  

Oh dear: After feuding with fellow contestant Areeba Emmanuel in the season's inaugural episode, Zoe-Clare told producers she was being mistreated because of the colour of her hair

'What's wrong with a ranga? I'm sorry, do you want me to dye my hair every 10 seconds, I'm so sorry, but this is natural guys. This is not going anywhere!' she fumed.
