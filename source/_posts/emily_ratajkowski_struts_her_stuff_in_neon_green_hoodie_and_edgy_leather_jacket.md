She has returned to New York City as the modelling industry resumes amid the pandemic.

The 29-year-old worked a neon green hoodie and long black leather jacket as she legged her way down the street.

The Inamorata founder wore tight black shorts and low-cut brown UGG boots showing off her long legs. 

She teamed the look with a bright neon yellow jacket and a black long-line blazer. 

The model covered her eyes in black boxy RayBan shades, leaving her brunette hair down in a sleek style, parted in the middle. 

For some delicate touches, she wore large gold hoop earrings while checking her phone.

Emily took her dog Colombo for a walk along the sidewalk before heading out solo. 

She has been keeping busy during her summer vacation, promoting her clothing line Inamorata on Instagram.

The Gone Girl actress was also recently among 100 different cover stars for the September issue of Vogue Italia, which was themed: '100 Covers, 100 People, 100 Stories.' 

Along with husband Sebastian Bear-McClard, Emily spent the majority of their quarantine with her parents in Los Angeles.

They caught a flight out of JFK in April, shortly after the CDC issued an advisory, asking 'residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.'

However in late June as COVID-19 cases spiked dramatically in California, Emily and Sebastian crossed back to New York.

In a piece published at the start of May she dished to British GQ that 'it’s been interesting being in quarantine and married.'

'I feel like a lot of people will end up divorced. But my husband and I are in a good partnership,' said Emily, whose spouse was a producer on Uncut Gems.

'And I think that I’ve learned a lot about myself being married, for sure,' the Inamorata founder added.

After returning to New York earlier this summer, she and Sebastian headed to the Hamptons and spent time at the beach before returning to the city.
