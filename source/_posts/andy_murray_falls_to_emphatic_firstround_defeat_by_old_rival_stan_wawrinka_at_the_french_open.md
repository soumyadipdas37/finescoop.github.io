Andy Murray was comprehensively beaten by Stan Wawrinka in three quick sets in the Scot’s first match at Roland Garros since 2017.

Murray was included in the main draw thanks to a wildcard, but his lack of playing time in recent years was evident as he was dispatched by 35-year-old Wawrinka, who won 6-1, 6-3, 6-2.
