An ex-Army sergeant who battered a father-of-two to death with 'ferocious' blows and stole from his home to pay off a drugs debt has today been jailed for life.

Daniel Shovelton, 40, was found guilty of killing Mark Bradbury, 58, in his own home in Warrington, Cheshire in an attempt to solve £53,000 of debt he had accumulated due to his £1,000-a-month drug habit.

He initially lied to police about sleeping in his parents' car at the time of the murder, but was caught on CCTV buying whisky with Mr Bradbury's cash just hours later.

Shovelton was today handed a life sentence with a minimum of 24 years in prison after being convicted of the murder at Liverpool Crown Court.

During a two-week trial, jurors heard how 'doting' dad Mr Bradbury was 'battered to death' in the harrowing ordeal in August last year.

Prosecutors said Shovelton saw 'small time' cocaine dealer Mr Bradbury, who sold drugs in order to fund his own habit, as the 'answer to his problems'.

Shovelton, who served in Afghanistan and Ireland, made three trips to his victim's street on the day of Mr Bradbury's death, and was captured a fourth time on CCTV in the area at 7.10pm.

He remained there for three hours before leaving shortly before 10pm.

The body of Mr Bradbury was discovered three days later, with a post-mortem investigation concluding that he had died of head and neck injuries. 

Shovelton, who had recently lost his job as a delivery driver, had known Mr Bradbury for 20 years before the attack and regularly bought cocaine from him. 

The court heard how he was living with his parents after his home was repossessed and had resorted to asking his daughter to lend him money.

Shovelton was found guilty of murder on Friday, after police found traces of blood on a key ring.  

Officers also recovered Mr Bradbury's gold ring inside his pocket and an empty packet of cigarettes which police believed were purchased on the evening of his death. 

The victim's daughter Hannah, 19, read out a 'powerful and poignant' statement in court as Shovelton was sentenced today.  

She said: 'It is extremely difficult to put into words the experience over the last year.

'It is a pain only imaginable and a living nightmare. The things I used to enjoy I do not anymore, and it does not get easier. On August 4, my life fell apart and nothing will ever fix that.

'People say I am brave, but I am not. I'm frightened and scared that I will never stop grieving.

'You cannot say everything happens for a reason as this shouldn't happen to anyone.

'My dad made memorable impressions on people and was someone who would give anyone the coat from his back.

'He will be greatly missed.'

Sentencing, Judge David Aubrey told Shovelton: 'In August last year, you battered and strangled to death Mark Bradbury in his own home. 

'I am satisfied that you killed him and intended to do so as you were desperate and he was an easy target.

'The killer, you, had been rumaging around and was looking for anything worth stealing.

'You went on a magical mystery tour to discard discriminating items, including your blood-stained clothing.

'A powerful and poignant statement from the victim's daughter describes him as someone who would give anyone the coat from his back.'

Detective Inspector Sarah Oliver, from Cheshire Police, added: 'I hope the conviction of Shovelton helps Hannah and all those who knew Mark to continue to come to terms with what happened.

'Shovelton has never shown any remorse for his actions and continues to avoid responsibility for the hurt he has caused.

'He has shown himself to be an utterly selfish man who put his own need for cash and cocaine above all else.

'He saw Mark as someone who he could take both - with devastating consequences.

'This case demonstrates the impact drug and gambling addiction can have and I would urge anybody with an addiction to seek help.'
