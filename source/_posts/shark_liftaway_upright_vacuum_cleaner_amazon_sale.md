With the right vacuum you can make light work of your housework but how do you choose between cordless, upright, bagged or bagless models? 

Upright hoovers are the most popular type of vacuum cleaner thanks to their ability to be pushed around rather than dragged behind you, allowing you to cover more floor space and get in-between furniture.

The Shark Lift-Away Upright Vacuum Cleaner NV601UK is one of the top-rated upright vacuum cleaners on Amazon. With over 8,000 ratings and a near-perfect average score of 4.7 out of 5, it's a winner and is even Mrs Hinch approved.

Usually £249, Amazon has slashed the price of the Shark vacuum by 40 per cent, so that it's now just £149. The deal is part of one of Amazon's Lightning deals, so you'll have up until midnight tonight to snap up the saving. 

The Shark Lift-Away Upright Vacuum Cleaner NV601UK is now 40 per cent off on Amazon - reduced to a very tempting £149 

The Shark vacuum - which is the same model that cleaning guru Mrs Hinch uses and raves about - has also gained impressive reviews from Amazon shoppers. 

In fact, 85 per cent of shoppers have given the Lift-Away a full five stars, scoring it highly for its powerful suction on any floor type, special pet hair attachment, low noise level, and versatile design that makes cleaning stairs a breeze.

While upright vacuum cleaners are traditionally more expensive than canister models, it comes with plenty of advantages which are worth the extra pennies. 

Super agile, the Shark Lift Away Vacuum comes with enhanced swivel steering giving you the freedom to whizz around your home, making light work of corners and hard to reach places. 

One of the big selling points of it is also that it converts from an upright to a portable vacuum cleaner within seconds, comfortably cleaning stairs, ceilings, curtains and more. 

Amazon shoppers have reported that it's equally as impressive on carpets as it is on hard floors, while the extended reach wand and included attachments make it incredibly versatile. 

'This is such a versatile vacuum cleaner. It morphs into whatever you need and is really easy to empty. Great for pet hairs - I have three cats! Highly recommend this product, and its great value for money. No negatives so far.' 

The vacuum is equipped with LED lights that illuminate concealed dust and pet hair pile-ups in dark areas and under furniture

The bagless vacuum is also great for allergy sufferers as it captures and holds 99.9 per cent of dust and allergens inside the vacuum. 

The strong, powerful suction is a particular hit with those fed up with pet hair. Thanks to the purposefully designed hair removal tool, the Shark Lift-Away effortlessly removes embedded pet hair from carpets, cushions and sofas. What's more, the vacuum also featured LED lights which illuminate dark areas.

'This Shark is fantastic. We have a Leonberger and a long-haired Somali cat. Hair is a massive issue! The sofa and carpets looked so different after using this! And so much came up we were constantly emptying it! Definitely recommend this.' 

Another agreed, writing: 'The shark vacuum has made my carpets look new again and removed all trace of pet hair. Highly recommend.' 

A third was impressed with the amount of hidden grime the Shark picks up, writing: 'Love this hoover! Thought my carpet and rug were clean.... thought... omg the stuff it got up! I had a Dyson, and I thought they were good!! Best money I've spent on a hoover.'
