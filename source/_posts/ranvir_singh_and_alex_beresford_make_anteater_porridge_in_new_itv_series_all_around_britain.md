Ranvir Singh and Alex Beresford get to grips with koalas and anteaters in their new ITV series All Around Britain. 

Every week, the Good Morning Britain hosts will present the show from some of the country’s most popular attractions and famous landmarks and discover their lesser-known stories. 

For the first episode, set to air on Sunday morning, Ranvir, 43, and Alex, 39, head to Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire.

They joined keepers to feed the koalas, sea lions and giraffes. 

The duo rolled up their sleeves to help prepare food for the park's twelve hundred residents, including mixing an insect porridge to feed a hungry anteater, which included plenty of mealworms and termites. 

Alex told MailOnline: 'We had a fun day filming the first episode of the new series at Longleat earlier this week. We met some koalas and fed the anteaters.

'I did have one moment of horror where I spilt some of the anteater porridge down my top. That was pretty disgusting. 

'It had meal worms, bugs and fruit in it. Ranvir also fed some hungry giraffes and it was amazing to meet some of the animals.

'Our new show kicks off on Sunday on ITV at 11.20am and we're really looking forward to it.

''It's a mix of us presenting from different locations and there will also be stories coming from across the UK too.'

It comes as Ranvir was announced as part of the Strictly Come Dancing line-up earlier this week. 

Ranvir joins the likes of former NFL star Jason Bell, The Wanted singer Max George and actress Caroline Quentin.
