She's the proud mother of two little girls.

And April Love Geary was glowing ahead of the weekend, as she was snapped getting some shopping done for her family on Thursday at Vintage Grocers in Malibu, California.

The model, 25, was in casual athletic wear for the outing, consisting of a form-fitting white t-shirt with capped sleeves and black short shorts.

April had a light teal hoodie tied around her waist, and wore heather grey sneakers on her feet.

The wife of Robin Thicke toted around some paper grocery bags, along with her gold-chained quilted black leather Yves Saint Laurent purse, which hung from her shoulder.

Geary's sunglasses were up in her brown hair, which hung long and straight down her back.

The showiest element of the catwalker's ensemble, however, was her black face mask, which brandished the word 'VOTE' in white lettering across the front.

April and Robin, 43, have been in a relationship since 2014, and the couple share two young daughters.

In 2018, they welcomed Mia Love, and one year later she was joined by her sister Lola Alain.

Robin, meanwhile, has a third child – he shares ten-year-old son Julian Fuego with ex-wife Paula Patton.

Thicke and Patton were wed from 2005 until 2015, with their divorce having been finalized when Robin was already involved with April.

The 5ft11in Huntington Beach, California native, a model signed with IMG, recently professed her continued love for her beau, with a super romantic post to her Instagram.

On Tuesday, April gushed over Robin as she shared a sweet Valentine's-themed snap of her sitting on the floor amid a display of rose petals.

The model looked stunning in a coral mini dress as she declared her love for the Blurred Lines singer.

The image saw April sitting in front of a romantic display which saw red rose petals shaped into a heart and scattered amid pillar candles.

The beauty captioned the snap 'I love you so much big head' while tagging the pop star.
