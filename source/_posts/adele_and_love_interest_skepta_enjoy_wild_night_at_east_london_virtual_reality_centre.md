Adele and her rumoured love interest Skepta enjoyed a fun-filled night on the town, at a virtual reality centre in east London on Tuesday. 

Having returned to the capital from her £7.7m Beverly Hills home, the Hello songstress, 32, was said to be putting on such a raucous display with the Boy Better Know star, who turned 38 on Saturday, at the futuristic venue. 

The 'couple', who were joined by MC Jammer, were spotted at OTHERWORLD, an 'innovative social entertainment concept using unique, multi-sensory virtual reality technology', which is held in a converted railway arch in a backstreet in Haggerston. 

Insiders told MailOnline: 'We were asked to move from the lounge because a VIP was arriving. I couldn’t believe it when Adele just walked in with Skepta and Jammer...

'After doing the VR I saw her chatting to people and putting her boots back on. She seemed really down to earth. They were screaming and laughing when they were doing the VR together, I could hear her from the other end of the venue...

'It looked like they had a lot of fun together.'

The venue charges from £12 for a 40 minute session, up to £44 for an hour and 10 minute session per person, while drinks range from £2.00 for half a pint of Stiegl Radler to a bottle of champagne - the brand of which is unlisted - for £135.00. 

The Hello hitmaker and rapper were first linked to in October last year after it had emerged that Adele's marriage to Simon Konecki had broken down.

Rumours swirled in March that Skepta, real name Joseph Junior Adenuga, confirmed that things are now over between himself and Adele in a new track, Mic Check, from his album, Insomnia.

In the track, he rapped: 'Can you handle the fame? You know you’re f***ing with a star? When you’re f***ing with me, they talk about you in the Press.'

As well as being linked with Adele, Skepta has been reportedly dating supermodel Naomi Campbell, 49, for a few months up until April 2018.

Adele's arrival in London comes after a recent storm, when she was accused of cultural appropriation while marking Notting Hill Carnival last month.

After the row kicked off, supermodel Naomi and thousands of fans supported Adele when she being accused of cultural appropriation for donning a Jamaican flag bikini.

In a picture shared to her Instagram, Adele, posing in the garden of Beverly Hills home, wore her hair in Bantu knots leading some branding the move 'insensitive'.

While some claimed the singer was profiting off black culture by sporting the style, many others pointed out the star grew up in Tottenham, London and has been surrounded by black culture throughout her life.

Having moved on from the drama and returned from the states, Adele is clearly giving a nod to social distancing rules as the venue is cautious over restrictions.
