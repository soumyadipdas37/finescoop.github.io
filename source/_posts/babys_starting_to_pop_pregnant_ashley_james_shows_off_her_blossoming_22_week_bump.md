 She is expecting her first child, a baby boy, next year. 

And Ashley James showed off her blossoming baby bump in an Instagram snap on Tuesday.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 33, who is 22 weeks pregnant, posed in a pink sports bra after a workout and said she was counting the days until she could meet her baby. 

Oh baby! Ashley James showed off her blossoming baby bump in an Instagram snap on Tuesday

Ashley cradled her bump in the mirror selfie and wrote: '22 weeks (and a few days). Admittedly about 50% of this bump is probably the roast chicken I demolished, but baby's starting to pop.

'He's quite nocturnal at the moment, but I love being able to feel him moving around. My lower back is starting to feel it, although it's starting to feel better now I'm few weeks into PT sessions. 

'It feels crazy to think next time it's summer I'll be a mummy. I'm loving the pregnancy journey, but I just want to meet him now. How's everyone else finding it?'

Ashley also shared a close-up snap of her bump and captioned the picture: 'Yesterday after a Sunday roast hahaha'.

It comes after the DJ admitted she feels like a 'new woman' following a successful bra fitting at the weekend, after going up five cup sizes. 

In a lengthy caption, Ashley revealed she felt 'sexy' and was loving her 'little bump'.  

The star - who is half way through her pregnancy - is having a baby boy with her boyfriend of nine-months Tom Andrews.

However she recently admitted she's been left worried about 'people commenting on the size of her bump'.

'My bump looks completely different depending on the time of day, or the position my body is in, and people have commented on how small my bump is pretty much from the moment I announced I was pregnant. 

'I started comparing my bump to others and worrying my baby wasn't growing properly, so much so I asked my midwife to check everything was ok.'

Ashley went on to explain that she has found support during the shaming by using social network Peanut to connect with other women across fertility and motherhood.
