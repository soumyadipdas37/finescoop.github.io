Today show host Allison Langdon has been a firm fixture in Australia's broadcasting industry for nearly two decades.

And the 41-year-old certainly hasn't aged a day since beginning her career for Channel Nine in 2001 as a junior researcher and producer.

While the presenter has swapped her out her shorter darker blonde tresses with lusciously lighter locks, she has always sported a youthful glow. 

What's her secret? Today show host Allison Langdon hasn't aged a day since beginning her career for Channel Nine in 2001 as a junior researcher and producer

Allison has worked her way up in the Channel Nine newsroom before hitting the big time as a reporter for the network's 60 Minutes programme.

The TV star went on to replace Deborah Knight as co-host of Weekend Today in December 2017, and she also became a fill-in presenter on Nine News Sydney and the Today show during the same time.

From January this year, Langdon began presenting the Today show with co-host Karl Stefanovic.

Despite her hectic schedule, Allison has also looked sensational for the cameras.

Allison has kept regularly coy about her beauty and fitness secrets over the years.

However, she has been regularly spotted enjoying the Bronte to Bondi coastal walk to stay in shape.

No doubt, her children, son Mack, 3, and two-year-old daughter Scout - who she shares with television executive husband Michael Willesee Jr. - keep her on her feet.

Speaking to 9Honey last year, Allison admitted that her approach to motherhood was very different the second time around.

'I'm such a different parent this time, I'm so much more relaxed – I think I've got it this time,' she said.

She admitted that when she fell pregnant for the first time, she wasn't 'naturally maternal'.

'Because it didn't come to me naturally I thought, "That's okay, like everything else I can just learn it. If I read enough books, I'd be awesome at it,"' she explained.
