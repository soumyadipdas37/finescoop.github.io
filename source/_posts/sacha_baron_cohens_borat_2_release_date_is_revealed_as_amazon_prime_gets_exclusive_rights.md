Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat 2 will be released on October 23 on Amazon Prime, it has been reported. 

According to Deadline, the highly-anticipated sequel to the actor's wildly successful 2006 comedy Borat, will premiere on Amazon after they bought the worldwide rights to the film.  

The sequel is titled Borat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan, according to a now-deleted listing at the Writers Guild of America website (via The Film Stage).

There were first hints that a sequel was happening in August, when Cohen was spotted in his iconic Borat suit driving an old pickup truck.

 Earlier this month, Collider reported the Borat sequel has already been filmed, and even screened for unspecified industry types, after the crew resumed production as soon as coronavirus restrictions were eased. 

Deadline reports Sacha, 48, 'risked his life' while filming and had to wear a bulletproof vest on two different shooting days.

MailOnline has contacted the comedian's representatives and Amazon for comment.  

While the title has yet to be confirmed with any official marketing materials, it does fall in line with the full title of the original film: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  

The name suggests that Pence will be a target, while former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani will also make an appearance.

The title also insinuates that Pence has ties to Russia, calling him 'Mikhael Pence' instead of Mike Pence, and giving him the Russian title of Vice Premiere instead of Vice President.

The original 2006 film featured Cohen playing his Borat character, which he first debuted on his hit TV series Da Ali G Show.

Borat was a TV reporter from Kazakhstan, who was sent to America with his producer Azamat (Ken Davitan).

While Borat is sent to report on the American way of life, he quickly becomes obsessed with the old TV series Baywatch, as he begins a quest to find and marry star Pamela Anderson.

The now-deleted Writer's Guild of America post also revealed that several different writers worked on the Borat sequel script.

The screenplay is credited to Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Swimer, Peter Baynham, Erica Rivinoja, Dan Mazer, Jena Friedman, and Lee Kern with story by Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Swimer, and Nina Pedrad.

Hines, Baynham and Mazer all got screenplay credit on the original Borat movie, with Cohen, Baynham, Hines and Todd Phillips getting story credit.

Friedman had written for Late Night with David Letterman and The Conners, while also acting in films like Palm Springs, while Nina Pedrad has written on 30 Rock, New Girl and Will & Grace.  

Larry Charles directed the first Borat movie, though it isn't clear if he directs the sequel.
