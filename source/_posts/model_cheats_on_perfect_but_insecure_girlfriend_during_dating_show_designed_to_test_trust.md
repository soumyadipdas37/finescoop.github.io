A couple decided to test the trust in their relationship by going on dates with other people.

Models Robbie and Saf, of London, had been dating for four months, but cracks started to show when Saf began to feel insecure about Robbie's commitment to their union.

The pair decided to put their love to the test by going on Just One Night, the BBC Three show which which gives couples 'the ultimate free pass' for one evening. 

But despite Saf hoping it would bring them closer together, Robbie ended up hitting it off with his date - and 'sealing the deal' with a snog at the end of the night.

Robbie and Saf got together after she 'slid into him DMs', and according to her it's been 'intense' ever since.

Saf gushed: 'I've not been with anyone I bounce off as much as I do with Robbie,' while he called her a 'beautiful person'.

'She's fun to be around, very caring and loving,' he added. 'She's almost a perfect girlfriend.'

However, Robbie claimed a couple of months after they began dating, Saf started to get annoyed when he didn't call her back at night, went to sleep early and didn't respond to her messages.

'She started to build up this insecurity,' he said, while Saf admitted: 'I think we weren't communicating and understanding each other. We were drifting apart a little bit.

'I started to find out about little things that have happened and the more things that came out, the more trust I'd lose,' adding that they could move forward if he was honest with her.

Robbie said: 'It's the most horrible thing to be in a relationship where you're not trusted.' 

Admitting that going out with other people would prove the ultimate test, Saf said: 'Ideally for me, I would love us to go on dates with other people, realise that we want to be together and get married next week.'

Prior to her date, Saf said she was excited but felt 'weird', as if she was cheating on Robbie. Meanwhile he claimed he 'won't hold back' if the girl is good-looking and they get along. 

Robbie's date - Ellisha Jade, 25, from Southampton, who runs a marketing agency - 'ticks all his boxes', while he suits her type which is men who are covered in tattoos and look like they're going to 'ruin your life'. Saf is also impressed by her date, hunky Dan, 22, right, a security engineer from Maidstone, Kent, who has been single for nine months

But while they spend much of their date discussing Saf and Robbie's relationship - which Dan admits he suspects is 'f*****' - Ellisha and Robbie enjoy the blossoming chemistry between them.

Despite her head being 'turned a bit', Saf remains faithful to Robbie - while he plants a snog on Ellisha.

Speaking about their break-up, Saf admitted: 'It's hard... I'm broken. But what I've been through will make me stronger'

'I didn't expect that I'd be on a date with someone who I clicked with so much,' he said at the end of the night. 

'It doesn't justify what I've done but it justifies how I feel, I can't lie to myself and I can't lie to her... I don't regret anything last night but at the same time I know I'm going to have to explain myself.'

When they met for breakfast the following day, Saf and Robbie agreed to go their separate ways - though Robbie kept quiet about the kiss. 

He added: 'Hopefully by the time she finds out about the kiss she'll have gotten over it all. I shouldn't have done that, but it happened.'
