As well as being a success in America the program was a massive hit in Britain and Ireland, spawning more than one cast album.

The cast also went on tour together, performing live concerts in Europe with a swirl of press reports about backstage drama and substance use.

Britain's Channel 4 got some of the cast back together for a TV special called Bring Back... Fame in 2008, hosted by Justin Lee Collins.

Erica said on that special that during the European shows, she got so fed up of Debbie's alleged domineering behavior she left the tour and returned to New York.

Last year a string of cast members including Valerie, Lee, Jesse, Erica and P.R. reunited in Liverpool for a couple of concerts.

Fame is not the first TV show whose cast has been reunited on Stars In The House - examples range from Frasier to Crazy Ex-Girlfriend to Star Trek: Voyager.
