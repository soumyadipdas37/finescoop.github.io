Hilary Duff reunited with her ex-husband Mike Comrie on Friday to spend time with their son Luca, aged eight. 

The exes appeared to be friendly as they walked around a local park in Los Angeles engaging in some chit-chat and activities, all while they wore protective masks amid the still raging COVID-19 pandemic.

Duff and Comrie, who married for more than five years, announced their separation in January 2014. 

Making it work: Hilary Duff, 32, took her son Luca to a local park in Los Angeles on Friday for an afternoon outing with her ex-husband Mike Comrie

Duff, 32, arrived at the park with Luca carrying a pair of sneakers in one hand and what appeared to be some sort of drawing/painting board in the other.  

She stood out in the fashion department in a multi-colored, spaghetti-strap dress that included patterns of red, green, blue, yellow, black and white.

Rounding out her ensemble, the Lizzie McGuire star wore a pair of sandals, a large chain-link necklace, and styled her blonde tresses long and with a part in the middle. 

Quality time: Duff and Comrie, a former hockey player who played 13-seasons in the NHL, shared time with their son both separately and together

Luca looked cute in black pants with a white t-shirt and sneakers.

His dad, a former professional hockey player who played 13-years in the NHL, enjoyed the family time in black shorts, t-shirt and white sneakers. 

Each parent got to spend some one-on-one time with Luca, and at other times all three of them talked while making their way around the park.

By mid-afternoon, Duff took to Instagram to gush about the progress her son is making in school, but with an added disclaimer about how he might be growing up a little too fast for her liking.  

'My guy is getting an expander and starting 3rd grade!!!!!! she wrote in the caption of a photo of mother and son flashing big beaming smiles.

'SOS it's going too fast! Slow down the tape!'   

The former couple began dating in 2007 and were eventually married in August 2010. They ended up splitting in 2014 and then finalized their divorce two-years later.

Duff also has a 22-month-old daughter Banks with her new husband and musician Matthew Koma.
