An off-road biker has been jailed for nine years for killing a 'peacemaker' with a single punch after he asked him to stop 'dangerous' nuisance riding near children.

James Rowley, 21, attacked Joe Higgins, 41, in front of youngsters in Radford, Coventry as the victim returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day on March 17.

The father-of-two fled the scene of the killing, where he had been noisily 'showing off' on grassland despite having no licence or insurance, and was arrested two days later.

Mr Higgins, who lived in Bedford but was originally from Coventry, died in hospital a day after suffering a head injury. 

Joe Higgins, 41, was attacked in front of children in Radford, Coventry, as he returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day on March 17

Rowley initially claimed to have acted in self-defence but later pleaded guilty to unlawful killing at Warwick Crown Court.

Judge Sylvia de Bertodano was told Rowley, who also admitted dangerous driving, had previously been given a referral order as a teenager for an assault in which his victim lost consciousness.

Passing sentence today, the judge said he had given police a false account of what happened as Mr Higgins returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day with his cousin.

She said: 'You were riding your motorbike in a way that was clearly dangerous and aggressive.

'You shouldn't in fact have been driving it at all as you had no licence and no insurance.

'Having ridden it on the wrong side of the road and through a red light... you arrived at Jubilee Crescent. You started riding the bike on the grassed area there.

'The bike had no lights and the danger you were causing was obvious - so obvious that a bystander called the police.

'It was this behaviour that caused Joe Higgins to come over and speak to you.'

Addressing the attack itself, the judge added: 'He tried to speak to you politely and tell you to stop.

'In the words of his brother, he was being a good citizen. You however refused to listen. You revved the engine and asked him if he 'wanted to get battered'.

'You then got off the bike with the clear intention of inflicting violence on Joe Higgins.

'You were described by one witness as bouncing on your toes like a boxer. Joe Higgins had his hands down.

'One witness described it as the most vicious punch he had ever seen.

'The punch caused him to fall to the ground and hit his head, whereupon you rode off dangerously and at speed, taking, as you went, his hat.'

The judge, who ordered Rowley to serve a two-year driving ban after his release from prison, added: 'On the facts of this case, the defendant was behaving in an aggressive manner well before he came across Joe Higgins.

'It [the punch] was sufficiently hard to bring a 17-stone man to the ground, a man who was acting as peacemaker, had his hands down and was unable to react to the blow.'

Prior to sentence, defence QC Kevin Hegarty, offering mitigation, said Mr Higgins had become concussed because he had hit his head on the ground.

Victim impact statements were also read to the court, including from the victim's partner and his twin brother Chris Higgins.

In his statement, Mr Higgins described his brother, a stepfather to three children, as a 'gentle giant' and true gentleman who was kind, caring and fun.

'At 41 he had his whole life ahead of him,' Mr Higgins said of his sibling.

'The happy future that Joe had planned has been cruelly taken away from him.'
