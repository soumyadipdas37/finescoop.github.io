Chelsea record £72M signing Kai Havertz was at the centre of a controversial handball VAR row as newly promoted West Brom were denied an unlikely win.

West Brom were clinging on to their three goal half-time lead when television replays appeared to show Havertz control the ball with an arm in the build-up to an injury time equaliser from Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham.

West Brom manager Slaven Bilic said: 'The third goal is difficult to accept because the handball was so clear.

Slaven Bilic was left furious after VAR missed a Kai Havertz handball on Saturday night 

The German talent appeared to handle the ball in the build-up to Tammy Abraham's leveller 

Abraham's grabbed a point for Chelsea after fighting back from their first-half nightmare

'I do not even want to talk about it because it is not "a maybe" or "a possibly" it IS a handball.

'That is end of story, full stop. How people can that is say not a handball is beyond me.

'I am proud of my players and they should be feeling that too in a buzzing dressing room, but it is not like that.

Kyle Bartley and Callum Robinson had put West Brom into a sensational 3-0 lead in the first 45

'The lads are disappointed because they did not get the three points they deserved

'As a manager I have to go into dressing room and see really disappointed faces because a couple of points have been taken for us because of a handball.'
