She is known for her body positive message and loves uplifting her fans. 

But Lizzo had some fun with her 9.2m Instagram followers on Wednesday as she teased them with an almost revealing top. 

The 32-year-old singer shared a video with her hair hanging down her chest and gave fans a quick reveal of what was underneath. 

Tease: Lizzo had some fun with her 9.2m Instagram followers on Wednesday as she teased them with an almost revealing top 

Standing in nude underwear, just a few shades deeper than her skin tone, the star sang a song to herself. 

Her long curly brown hair hung down her front nearly to her hips, over a mesh top, with no visible bra underneath. 

She flipped one part of hair over her shoulder, revealing supportive concealing tape covering her chest. 

Flashing a shocked face, she did the same with the other side, saying to the camera 'you thought!'

Gotcha: Her long curly brown hair hung down her front nearly to her hips, over a mesh top, with no visible bra underneath. She flipped one part of hair over her shoulder, revealing supportive concealing tape covering her chest 

Think again: Flashing a shocked face, she did the same with the other side, saying to the camera 'you thought'

Lizzo (born Melissa Viviane Jefferson) continued to tease viewers, writing 'You thought you were gonna see titties! But you didn't you. You didn't see titties you saw tape b***h.' 

She captioned the video 'made ya look,' as she continued to poke fun at the moment. 

Lizzo has had a meteoric rise to fame, after her song Truth Hurts became a viral sensation in 2019. 

The song won her Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2020 Grammys, along with debut album—Cuz I Love You—winning best Best Urban Contemporary Album, and her song Jerome winning Best Traditional R&B Performance.

Earlier this week, Cardi B revealed she wanted Lizzo to be in the music video for her song WAP, with Megan Thee Stallion.  

'I’m cool with Lizzo and everything,' she said. 'Like, we’ve been sending DMs to each other and all that. But she was on vacation and she wasn’t in town.'

The scheduling conflict partly unraveled Cardi's vision for the video. 

'I was like, "Oh my gosh," because I had a whole vision about how I want to see Lizzo and everything,' the I Like It hitmaker said.

Adding: 'It was so important to me to include different women that are different races and come from different backgrounds, but are so powerful and influential.' 

Kylie Jenner, Normani and Rosalia joined Mulatto, Sukihana and Rubi Rose to make appearances in the video. 

Since being released three weeks ago, the WAP video has amassed 33.4m views. 

The song spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first female rap collaboration to debut in the spot.
