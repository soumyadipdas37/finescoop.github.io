She debuted her new romance with athlete Matt Poole earlier this week. 

And on Saturday, Tammy Hembrow and her hunky beau appeared to be making things official as they shared their first selfie together on Instagram.

Uploading a photo to his Instagram account, Matt is seen planting a kiss on Tammy's cheek while they enjoyed a boat cruise around Hamilton Island.

'Hey lover,' Tammy, 26, quickly commented underneath the post. 

The photo appeared to be taken on Thursday, when Tammy and her hunky Ironman chartered a luxury yacht to the Whitsundays with friends. 

And while Matt is yet to make an appearance on the bikini-clad model's feed, he has appeared on her Instagram stories.

On Saturday, Tammy set Instagram alight when she posted two very revealing photos of herself clad in a tiny g-string bikini as she sat on all fours on the sand. 

Earlier this week, Tammy and her friends hired a luxury vessel from Big Blue Charters, where rates begin at $1,000 per hour.

What a welcome! A video posted by one of Tammy's friends showed the blonde bombshell and her friends boarding the ship and receiving champagne and watermelon slices on arrival

Matt was also seen enjoying a few sips of a cold beer as his friend raced him to finish his entire drink before the boat set sail.  

Tammy's trip to the Whitsundays comes after she and Matt were spotted packing on the PDA at Brisbane Airport, earlier on Thursday.

Her ex-fiancé Reece Hawkins's recent baby announcement with London Goheen seemed like the last thing on Tammy's mind as she cosied up to her statuesque new lover. 

Matt was previously in a relationship with Maddy King - the model ex of Kris Smith.
