Seven people were shot inside a Wisconsin funeral home Wednesday, officials say.

The shooting broke out at about 12.45pm during a funeral at the Serenity Funeral Home located at the 4200 block of West Fond Du Lac Avenue in Milwaukee. 

The victims were between 24 and 48 years old and all are in stable condition and expected to survive.  

'Our prayers are with the victims and their family members during this terrible time. This is an untenable situation, this brazen act that was done in broad daylight is unacceptable in our city. We are working feverishly to identify who committed this act,’ Acting Chief Michael Brunson Said in a press conference Wednesday.
