Parts of Austria and Switzerland were surprised by unseasonably early snowfall overnight a month before it is expected.

The Swiss meteorological agency said earlier today that the town of Montana, in the southern canton of Valais, experienced almost 10 inches (25 centimetres) of snowfall — a new record for this time of year.

The change came after a sharp drop in temperatures and heavy precipitation. 

Authorities were out in force across mountainous regions in the two Alpine nations to clear roads that had become blocked by snow and ice.

In parts of Austria, snowfall was recorded as low as 1,805 feet (550 meters) above sea level.  

Late October usually heralds the very first big snowfalls and the early signs of winter in the Alps when average temperatures in the valley drop to below 50F (10C).
