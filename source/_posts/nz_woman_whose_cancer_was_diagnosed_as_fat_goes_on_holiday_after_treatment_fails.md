A woman left fighting for her life after a doctor mistakenly dismissed cancerous lumps on her legs and feet as fat has embarked on a 'bucket list' holiday. 

Gemma Malins, 28, was diagnosed with stage-four metastatic melanoma in October last year.

The New Zealand woman, who was studying to be an early childhood teacher, hasn't been responding to treatment for the aggressive cancer that has spread to her brain and lungs.   

Many of the tumours aren't shrinking and some have even grown in size. 

Ms Malins and her partner Brandon, 21, are now focusing on ticking items off of her bucket list.

The couple flew to Queenstown from Auckland on September 7 to celebrate both of their birthdays in 'holiday of a lifetime', Stuff reported.

The plans were temporarily in jeopardy after Auckland was forced into a coronavirus lockdown last month.

However, after only missing two days of their trip, the couple were able to re-book their cancelled flights and accommodation and fly to Queenstown. 

They participated in activities such as horse riding, a helicopter ride, the luge and a gondola trip.

The newlyweds even got to have dinner with the woman who made everything possible for them to go on the trip.

Ms Malins ended up in hospital during one day of their trip when she began to feel ill. 

She said she was just taking things one step at a time and couldn't do it without her husband at her side.

The pair fast-tracked their wedding plans after getting the shattering diagnosis.

The couple tied the knot in a small beach ceremony in December 2019 after two weeks of planning. 

Ms Malins described it as the most 'perfect day'. 

'We fast tracked the wedding as we just didn't know what the future held, we still don't,' she said. 

She said she was just taking things one step at a time and couldn't do it without her husband at her side 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia in July, she shared how she has been left fuming because she first raised her concerns about the lumps with her GP a year earlier.

She saw a doctor who said the lumps on her legs were lipoma, a fatty tissue which can develop under the skin as people age. 

The benign growths are rarely harmful But as the growths spread throughout her body, Ms Malins grew concerned. 

She went to a new GP who broke the news that the lumps could be more serious.

Stage 4 melanoma means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, brain, or other organs and tissue. 

It may have also spread to lymph nodes that are a good distance from the original tumor. As such, stage 4 melanoma is often hard to cure with current treatments. 

But she had to endure another three-month wait before she saw a specialist who confirmed the cancer diagnosis. 

'It was such a shock at the time I actually couldn't even process it,' Ms Malins said. 'It changed our whole lives dramatically.

'It's frightening. I'm scared about dying all the time. 

'We had planned to have children, we have so much baby stuff that we've collected up but now we can't even think about that.' 

Ms Malins is now undergoing a type of immunotherapy called Keytruda, with a two-year plan in place.  

Her husband has given up his beekeeping job to care for his wife while she fights for her life. 

'He's been by my side for every treatment and every good and bad day,' she said.

'My husband has been a soldier.' 

They have started a Givealittle page to raise money for their adventures.
