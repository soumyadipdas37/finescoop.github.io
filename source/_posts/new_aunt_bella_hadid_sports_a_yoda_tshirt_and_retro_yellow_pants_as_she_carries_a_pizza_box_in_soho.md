She recently added doting aunt to her repertoire. 

And model Bella Hadid was rocking some funky aunt style in New York City's Soho district on Saturday, when she was spotted with her hands full carrying a pizza box, jacket and designer purse back to her apartment.

Bella, 23, wore a yellow and green-accented t-shirt featuring the likeness of Star Wars character Yoda, which she paired with retro two-tone yellow pants.

The runway model had a black jacket over her arm and held on to a round white Goyard purse with gold metalwork. 

The younger sister of Gigi Hadid had her brown hair up in an easy top bun, and she wore ovular specs. 

To protect against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Bella had on a white Evolve face mask.

She wore a gold pendant around her neck, and two types of earrings.

Just days prior to the sighting, Bella's elder sister Gigi, 25, welcomed a baby girl with her partner Zayn Malik. 

'Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she’s already changed our world. So in love,' Gigi captioned a photo of the baby's hand on Wednesday, on her Instagram.

Thus far, Bella has not yet made any public comment on the birth of her niece since the couple announced the big event.

'Our baby girl is here, healthy and beautiful,' he gushed, writing that 'to try put into words how i am feeling right now would be an impossible task.'

He added: 'The love I feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, and thankful for the life we will have together x.'

The beauty appeared in the tease for Rihanna's next Savage X Fenty lingerie show, strutting her stuff alongside the likes of Lizzo and Demi Moore.
