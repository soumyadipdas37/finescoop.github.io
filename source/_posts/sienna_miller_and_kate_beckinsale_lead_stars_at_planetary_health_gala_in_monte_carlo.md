Sienna Miller bounced back after splitting from her fiancé Lucas Zwirner as she donned a racy PVC gown at the 2020 Monte Carlo Gala for Planetary Health on Thursday.

The actress, 38, put on a busty display in the sexy gown with a caged neckline as she joined Kate Beckinsale, 47, on the star-studded blue carpet in Monaco.

Hosted by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the annual event gathers leading philanthropists, talents and scientists to join forces and launch the charity's initiatives to bridge the widening gap between health and the environment. 

The 2020 Monte-Carlo Gala for Planetary Health aims to highlight the idea that our future is dependent on healthy ecosystems.

Hosted by the Prince’s foundation, it has gathered talents, philanthropists, decision makers and scientists to discuss the challenges the planet’s environment faces.

The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.

Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.  

However it's likely this year's event has seen drastic changes to ensure social distancing can be adhered to, with many stars also donning masks as they arrived on the blue carpet. 

The Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation was set up in 2006 with the aim to protect the environment and promote sustainable development at a local and global scale.

It has 10 international branches across the globe, including in France, America, the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Spain and China.
