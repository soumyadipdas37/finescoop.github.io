She welcomed her fifth child with husband David Tennant in October last year.

And Georgia Tennant shared a candid post about feeding her eleven-month-old child, and posted a snap via Instagram on Saturday to celebrate Breastfeeding Awareness Month.

The actress, 35, could be seen sat in a stairwell as she held her little one close to her and breastfed, while clothes and toys were strewn across the floor around her.

'I hope this makes anyone struggling feel better': David Tennant's wife Georgia shared a candid post about breastfeeding her daughter Birdie via Instagram on Saturday

Georgia blonde locks covered her face as she sat on a makeshift chair that appeared to be in her wardrobe in a white shirt and shorts. 

Georgia wrote in the caption: 'Just realized I missed #breastfeedingawarenessmonth (too busy actually doing it) and hate to think I’d missed an opportunity to post a photo with my t**s out. 

'So here is what my 'breast feeding journey' looks like currently. I hope this makes anyone struggling feel better but most importantly I hope it makes @mariekondo move in with me for a weekend (might need longer)' 

Honest: The actress was sat in a stairwell as she held her little one close to be fed while clothes and toys strewn across the floor which she claimed was her 'breastfeeding journey'

Romance: David met Georgia when she had a guest role in the 2008 Doctor Who episode The Doctor's Daughter, and they wed in 2011 (pictured together last week)

Last month, Georgia  shared a rare glimpse of their daughter Birdie, 10 months, in a sweet family video shared via Instagram.

In the video the actress filmed her little girl as she excitedly walked towards a toy teapot that had been placed on the floor.

Birdie looked sweet in a light pink and white shirt and matching shorts, and she was seen slowly making her way to the toy by herself.

Joking about her daughter's fascination with the toy, Georgia wrote in the caption: 'Still lured by the call of tea.'

Georgia confirmed the arrival of her fifth child last year with a hilarious Instagram post, as she compared the birth to that of David's Good Omens co-star Michael Sheen's daughter Lyra. 

She became pregnant for the first time as a teenager after a fleeting relationship with a university student, which resulted in the birth to Ty at 17. He was later adopted by David in 2012.

Ty revealed the name of his youngest sibling during an appearance on Lorraine in March, excitedly telling the host he wanted to give a shout-out to his family.

He said: 'Hi mum, I love you mummy. Hi dad, Wilfred, Olive, Doris, Birdie… I love you all. Sorry, I've always wanted to do that,' which led Lorraine to agree that he 'had all the family covered.'

During the interview, Ty also spoke of the moment he met his adopted dad on the set of Doctor Who when he was just five years old.

Family ties: David and Georgia have five children called Ty, 18, Olive, nine, Wilfred, seven, Doris, five, and also a child named Birdie who was born in October

The budding actor spoke of his close bond with the sci-fi superstar whom he calls his father, and why he would love to be the third Doctor in the family. 

David met Ty's mum when she had a guest role in the 2008 episode The Doctor's Daughter - and it was then when Ty met his TV hero.

'It was great, I was five when I first met my dad, my mum was working on Doctor Who at the time,' Ty said.

'I watched him on TV as the hero, and it was crazy how much your life can change.'
