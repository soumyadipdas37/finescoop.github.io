A former Australia's Next Top Model star has revealed how she suffered from 'situational depression' after being crowned winner of the show back in 2010. 

Amanda Ware, now 28, said she initially avoided seeing the show's therapist throughout filming her season due the stigma associated with therapy.

It was not until the then 'young 18-year-old' was juggling life and a modelling career between Sydney and New York that she reached out for help.

'I was so upset, I couldn't function': Australia's Next Top Model star Amanda Ware has revealed she suffered from 'situational depression' after being crowned winner of the show 10 years ago 

The brunette said she promptly contacted the show's psychologist, who was there to help contestants through filming the series. 

'I was exhausted, I was so upset and couldn't function basically,' she told Gabrielle Scawthorn on the Back From Reality podcast.

'The psychologist said it as kind of 'situational depression' ... I didn't have a routine which is what the last 18 years of my life had been.

'That's something most models struggle with.'

Amanda, who won ANTM by three votes to contestant Kelsey Martinovich, had two sessions and was advised to have a structured routine - or at least plan her day ahead.

'A lot of it is scheduling and having a routine, and having something in your life you can look forward to,' Amanda explained on the podcast.

It was not until the then 'young 18-year-old' (pictured) was juggling life and a modelling career between Sydney and New York she reached out for help

'Whether that's going to the gym or, I don't know, getting a facial every six weeks. 

'(You need) something that makes you settled and in one place ... and having a life, which is what people miss.'

She said having a 'constant battle of feeling anxious, feeling not good enough and being judge on your looks' also contributed to her reaching out for help.

Coping mechanism: The model (pictured) had two sessions with the psychologist, who advised having a structured routine - or at least planning her day ahead - would help her to cope

'My sessions were just about how to move on past the show because obviously you're in this environment for however long and they do have the support for you afterwards but you're kind of just made to feel "get on with it, get on with your life and enjoy it",' Amanda said.

'And I'm kind of like "I don't really know how to feel" so therapy for me was so beneficial and while I didn't have any sessions there - but two after - I do thank them for having that physiologist there because it was needed.'
