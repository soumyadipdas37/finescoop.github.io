And Alexandra Cane displayed the fruits of her labour as she posed in a tiny bronze bikini via her Instagram page on Monday. 

The Love Island star, 29, uploaded the racy selfie as she promoted her fitness plan.

The reality TV personality rocked the shimmering two-piece that tied at her waist, displaying her incredibly toned physique. 

Alexandra's white robe draped over her arms, and she added a touch of glamour with a gold necklace and hoop earrings. 

The reality starlet styled her raven tresses in a messy bun and opted for a dewy make-up look.  

Earlier this month, Alexandra revealed she previously battled suicidal thoughts and ended up in hospital due to her anxiety.

Journey: The Love Island star, 29, took to Instagram this month to share before and after snaps as she reflected on her mental and physical journey over the past 12 months

She shared a bikini snap on Instagram alongside a throwback image of herself with a fuller figure and told her fans: 'This exact date last year I was seriously low'. 

In a lengthy, candid post, she discussed her one-year journey in which she has overhauled her lifestyle and addressed her unhealthy relationship with alcohol.   

The beauty also told how the past year has been 'confusing' and 'testing' for her, while also revealing that maintaining her healthy lifestyle had been the 'hardest part' of her process. 

She penned: 'WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES. This year has honestly been one of the most confusing, testing years of my life (and I think for a lot of others too) but my word has it taught me so many lessons that I will never EVER forget.

Her story: In an open and honest Instagram post, the Love Island star recalled the changes she's made in her life both physically and mentally and how it's helped her for the better

'This exact date last year I was seriously low and clasping at straws to find ways to get myself feeling better. 

'To look back at where I was then and where I am now, it’s almost like I’m looking at two different people. Not even just physically, but mentally I know how far I've come. 

'I had the worst anxiety, falling asleep thinking about death every night, zero purpose, zero motivation, in denial about my relationship with alcohol, food & most importantly, myself.

'My life has been turned absolutely upside down - and for the better.'
