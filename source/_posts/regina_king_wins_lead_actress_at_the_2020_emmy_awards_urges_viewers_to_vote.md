Regina King was sure to make a political statement as she won big at the Emmy Awards on Sunday night. 

Regina, 49, won the lead actress in a limited series award for the HBO superhero show Watchmen, as Angela Abar. 

Wearing a T-shirt honoring Breonna Taylor - the Louisville EMT who was fatally shot by police on March 13 - King also urged viewers at home to vote and gave a shout out to the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Surprise! The moment Regina King finds out she has won the Lead Actress Award at the Emmy Awards on Sunday evening 

King said from her home: 'Have a voting plan. Go to Ballotpedia. Vote up the ballot. Please. Go to Ballotpedia and find out who are voting in your municipal elections. It is very important. Be a good human. Rest in power RBG.'

Ginsburg, the Former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, died on Friday, and King gave her respects by saying 'rest in power RBG' during her short speech.
