She's been busy cutting her teeth as the new judge on the current season of NBC's America's Got Talent.

But at the weekend, Sofia Vergara managed to spend some quality time with her husband Joe Manganiello and beloved pup Baguette.

The couple wore cloth face masks for their outing as required under California law during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The number had short sleeves and was gathered just below the bust.

The former Modern Family star left her long hair loose and styled with a center parting and carried a large designer purse.

Manganiello, 44, was more casually attired in a graphic t-shirt and gray knee-length shorts.

The Magic Mike alum added gray trainers and designer sunglasses.

The Colombian-born actress joined AGT following the end of her hugely successful ABC sitcom after 11 seasons.

It was her first high profile gig after Modern Family and she joined Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel and returning judge Heidi Klum on the panel.

Meanwhile, she and Manganiello will celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary later this year.

Back on June 15, the couple had marked the anniversary of their first dinner date with a romantic meal at the mansion they share in Los Angeles. 

The actress posted a photo to Instagram showing them seated across from each other at a formal dining table in a room opening up onto their garden.

The couple started dating in 2014 and tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in Florida in November 2015. 

In a recent interview for People, Manganiello explained: 'I knew pretty quickly that I could trust her, and she knew pretty quickly that she could trust me.'  

The True Blood actor added: 'I was capable of putting her wishes ahead of mine, whatever they were, and she was capable of doing the same. Once you have that, you don't let go of it.'
