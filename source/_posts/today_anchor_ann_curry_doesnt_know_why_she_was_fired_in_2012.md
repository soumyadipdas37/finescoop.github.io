Eight years after she was ousted from the Today show, Ann Curry has admitted that she still doesn't 'really understand' why she was fired as a co-anchor, while confirming that she was 'verbally sexually harassed' at NBC. 

During an interview with Elle, the 63-year-old journalist opened up about the mystery behind her untimely exit and whether she was pushed out because she had warned NBC executives about her former co-anchor Matt Lauer's behavior toward women.  

'I know I did nothing wrong. I know I was good at my job,' said Curry, who was let go just one year after being hired as Lauer's co-anchor. 'They say where there’s smoke, there’s fire. You can read the tea leaves. But you know, I’m a fact-based reporter, so it’s hard for me to go out there, with something so close to the vest. I don’t know. I don’t know.' 

Honest: Ann Curry, 63, opened up about the mystery behind her exit from the Today show in 2012, saying she's not sure what happened because she 'did nothing wrong'

Candid: Curry, pictured with Al Roker and Matt Lauer, confirmed she was 'verbally sexually harassed' at NBC, saying: 'It’s still going on in many places, and it was going on where I worked'

There has been ongoing speculation that Curry was replaced because had spoken out against her former co-host. In a 2018 report from the Washington Post, Curry revealed that a colleague had confided in her about being 'sexually harassed physically' by Lauer. 

Curry said she had told management that 'they had a problem and they needed to keep an eye on him and how he deals with women.' She shared her warning about Lauer in 2012, the same year she was let go. 

'I still don’t really understand it. If I had known what was happening in the back rooms of power, then I would know,' she said. 

'I obviously was not in those rooms... I think that many people have guessed why [I was replaced], but I’ve held myself back. I’ve asked people why, and I haven’t gotten a good answer.' 

When asked about her previous comments about the 'climate of verbal sexual harassment' at NBC, Curry touched upon her own experiences as a woman at the network but didn't go into detail.  

Hard to handle: In June 2012, Curry broke down in tears during her last appearance on the Today show as Lauer's co-host. 'The bottom line is that it still hurts,' she said eight years later

Truth? There has been speculation Curry was let go because she had warned NBC execs about Lauer's behavior towards women. In 2017, he was fired amid allegations of sexual misconduct

'Are you asking me if I’ve ever been verbally sexually harassed? Yeah, of course. Who hasn’t?' she said. 'It’s still going on in many places, and it was going on where I worked.' 

In 2017, five years after Curry left Today following her tearful on-air goodbye, Lauer was fired from the show amid allegations of sexual misconduct. 

In a statement at the time, Lauer said that 'there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed.' The disgraced anchor was later accused of rape, an allegation he vehemently denied. 

Curry said she still has 'some friends' at her former network, noting: 'There has been more than one [woman] who’s come to me now [about Lauer]. I hope they’ve come to me because they know that I’ll be empathetic and compassionate. I’m a right-and-a-wrong girl.

Confidante: Curry said there has been more than one woman who has come to her now about Lauer. 'They’re dealing with trauma that threatens to be lifelong,' she said 

Painful memories: Curry said she has 'no regrets' about how she behaved and is 'very proud' of all the work she was able to achieve during her time on the show, but it 'still hurts' 

'And I’m happy to be their friend,' she added. 'This is a deep level of suffering, from what I’ve learned. They’re dealing with trauma that threatens to be lifelong.' 

Curry said she has 'no regrets' about how she behaved and is 'very proud' of all the work she was able to achieve during her time on the show, but her departure is still a painful memory.  

'The bottom line is that it still hurts,' she said. 'It honestly hurts really deeply, because I really think I did nothing wrong. But in spite of the pain of it, which still lingers, I know that I contributed to some people suffering less.

'But I tell you, it was tough,' she added. 'It was hard to walk that line, to not add more [suffering]. Boy, oh boy, was it tough.'
