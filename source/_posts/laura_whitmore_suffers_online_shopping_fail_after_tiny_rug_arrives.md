Laura Whitmore suffered an online shopping fail on Thursday after ordering a pastel geometric print rug, only for it to arrive a quarter of its size. 

The Celebrity Juice captain, 35, took to Instagram to share a comedic Insta versus reality post, as she compared the rug advertised to the tiny one that arrived. 

Laura soon realised as she stood on the doormat she had ordered the wrong size.

Laura captioned the snap: 'So I ordered this... and today, this arrived (SWIPE >)'.

Little Mix's Perrie Edwards replied: 'SCREAMIN 2020 hun', while Holly Willoughby's stylist commented: 'No way'.

Designer Charlotte Simone typed: 'If there was ever a picture for 2020'.

Meanwhile, Laura began filming on a farm on Friday as she and new captain Emily Atack teased a first look at Celebrity Juice via Instagram. 

Laura and the actress, 30, took to their social media to share snaps from a picturesque farm where they were shooting scenes with Keith Lemon for the programme's next season.

Holly Willoughby, who the pair replaced on the show, also gave her stamp of approval as she shared a snap of the trio and wrote 'Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit! (sic)'

The trio kept a tight lip on exactly what they were filming, but appeared to be having a great time as the trio smiled for photos together. 

One snap saw Emily, Laura and Keith pose for a fun selfie on the farmland, as Laura put on an animated display by flexing her muscles.  

ITV2's comedy panel series will see comedian Keith return to host eight episodes this autumn, followed by two 60-minute specials. 

In a cheery, socially-distanced snap, the funnyman joined his latest sidekicks as they toasted to their new jobs with glasses of champagne.
