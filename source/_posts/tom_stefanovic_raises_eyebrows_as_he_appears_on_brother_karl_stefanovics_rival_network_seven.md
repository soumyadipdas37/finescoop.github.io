His brother Karl Stefanovic is a longtime star at Channel Nine and the co-host of the Today show. 

But despite his family connections with the network, Tom Stefanovic raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he appeared on the rival station, Channel Seven. 

Tom and his wife Jenna Dinicola appeared on The Morning Show to promote her family's almond farm, Mandolé Orchard.   

Say what?! Tom Stefanovic raised eyebrows on Wednesday as he appeared on brother Karl Stefanovic's rival network Seven to talk about his almond farm. Karl is pictured on Today

Her family, including her parents, also appeared in the segment. Their farm is located in Wynangan, NSW, and they produce products including almond milk.

Jenna and Tom gave up their jobs to move back to the country. 

Jenna told The Morning Show about the move, saying: 'When you look around it isn't hard to see why we moved back to the country, but more importantly we're really passionate about educating people about the health benefits of Australian almonds.'

Tom then went on about the 'health benefits' of almonds and said: 'They're a super food or a super nut if you'd like, they're packed with all the essential minerals, vitamins and antioxidants... all the good things in it.' 

Tom's appearance on Channel Seven is rather interesting. 

Not only does Karl work for Channel Nine, but Tom used to be a cameraman for the network.

Their brother Peter also worked for Nine for 15 years as a reporter and foreign correspondent, however joined Sky News in May last year. 

His wife Sylvia Jeffreys also works for Nine and stars on Today Extra.

In 2018, Karl and Peter were embroiled in the Ubergate scandal, when New Idea magazine obtained a transcript of a private phone conversation between pair in which the brothers candidly discussed their Channel Nine colleagues.

The conversation had been overhead by an Uber driver, who was listening as his passenger, Peter, spoke to Karl loudly on speakerphone.

Peter previously reflected on the scandal and his feelings of shame and embarrassment in an interview with The Herald Sun.

'I was embarrassed, I was ashamed about it all too because I got my network into trouble... I got my wife [Sylvia Jeffreys] and brother [Karl] into trouble; and I took that really hard,' he said. 

Karl was axed by Nine from the Today show in 2018, shortly after the scandal. But he returned to co-host the Today show alongside Allison Langdon earlier this year. 

Channel Nine declined to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.
