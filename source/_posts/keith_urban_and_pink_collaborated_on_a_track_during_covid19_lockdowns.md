Pink, real name Alecia Beth Moore, lends her incredible voice in the funky mid-tempo ballad, which features on Keith's new album 'The Speed Of Now Part 1'.

'I’ve always loved Pink’s voice,' Keith said in a media statement, adding: 'her artistry and her multi-faceted ability to create, and her God-given talent, truly makes her one of the greatest voices of our time.'

While the global coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns presented challenges for the musicians to collaborate, they are proud of the end result.

Keith and Pink were not only forced to piece together the recording separately, they found themselves at opposite sides of the globe – Pink in Los Angeles and Keith in Sydney – when filming the music video.

The musician returned home to Australia in July with his family as actress wife Nicole Kidman began to film her new mini-series, Nine Perfect Strangers. 

In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Keith promoted the release of the track and its official music video.

'[The video] will be coming to you from the middle of the ocean. Serious, literally, with Pink. It will be premiering exclusively on Facebook. I can't wait for you guys to see this video. I think it turned out amazing,' he said.
