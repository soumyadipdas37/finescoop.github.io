She's been working hard ever since she returned to her eponymous TV programme earlier this month following a summer break. 

And Lorraine Kelly looked cheery as she dined with her daughter Rosie at celebrity hot spot Scott's in Mayfair on Wednesday evening.

The presenter, 60, and her only child, 25, caught up over some wine before bursting into laughter during their lively outing.

Cutting an elegant figure, the media personality slipped into a navy wrap dress, which she teamed with grey pointed heels, a shawl and a gold handbag.

Marketing and community manager Rosie, who was based in Singapore, styled a floral print dress with a denim jacket and white trainers.

The pair appeared in great spirits as they chatted up a storm, before the host left her embarrassed by making a joke at the table.

Earlier this month, Lorraine detailed the pain of going through a miscarriage, insisting the loss 'never leaves you.'

The broadcaster took to Twitter to respond to a post by First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, who shared the story of the country's Justice Minister Humza Yousaf and his wife Nadia El-Nakla and their loss.

In her post, Nicola wrote: 'Brave account of miscarriage from ⁦@HumzaYousaf & Nadia El-Nakla. It's an experience my husband & I had just once, but it never leaves you.

'Nadia's account of the physical pain especially sparks awful memories. We don't talk about all this enough.'

Agreeing with Nicola's poignant message, the TV star retweeted it and added: 'Affects far too many of us @nicolasturgeon and you are so right. It never leaves you xx'

Lorraine, who shares Rosie with her husband of 28 years Steve Smith, previously revealed the devastating loss happened when her daughter was five. 

In 2015, she told OK! Magazine: 'Another baby would have been super. But, hey, it didn't happen. I had a miscarriage when Rosie was about five.'
