A woman who befriended serial killer Dennis Nilson while he was in prison and keeps his ashes in her home says she would 'forget about his crimes' when they talked.  

Nilson, known as the Muswell Hill Murderer, died at the age of 74 at HMP Full Sutton in 2018, 34 years into his life sentence for carrying out a murderous spree in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

One of the nation's most notorious murderers, Nilsen is believed to have killed as many as 15 gay men, most of them homeless, at his homes in Cricklewood and Muswell Hill, north London.

Andrea Kubinova, 30, from the Czech Republic, started a platonic relationship with the killer after sending him a hand-drawn picture of his dog Bleep, and was given his his ashes, and his spectacles to remember him by after his death. 

Appearing on Good Morning Britain today, Andrea told that while she feels 'heartbroken' for his victims, the killer came across as 'friendly and a nice person', once she had forgotten about the 'profanity of his crimes'. 

Dennis Nilson, known as the Muswell Hill Murderer, died at the age of 74 last year at HMP Full Sutton last May, 34 years into his life sentence for carrying out a murderous spree in the late 1970s and early 1980s

Andrea Kubinova, 30, from the Czech Republic, started a platonic relationship with the killer and appeared on Good Morning Britain to speak about their friendship 

And asked if it's true she still has Nilsen's glasses and how some people would find that creepy, she said: 'Yes, I have them right here. The glasses. 

'You have to think about it as a normal friendship, forget about all those killings, forget about the profanity of those crimes. To me he was just a friend. Is it not normal to have a memory of a friend who passed away?'

Dennis' crimes have been portrayed in Des, a chilling new three-part drama from ITV and the killer will be portrayed by Broadchurch and Doctor Who star David Tennant. 

Speaking of David Tennant's portrayal, she said: 'It was like seeing a ghost, it was brilliant. Absolutely stunning.'

Andrea first contacted Nilson after reading a true crime book, and becoming intrigued by his 'motivation [for killing] and his loneliness', as well as his love of animals. 

'I used to collect signatures', she told. 'Eventually I got all the big names and it just was the thrill, if you will. 

'At the time a friend gave me a real crime book and I came across this name. I found it very intriguing; the motivation, the loneliness, it all felt intriguing. Plus his love of animals was something that stood out compared to all the other killers.' 

She added: 'I was very nervous, I had nothing interesting to say, to be honest. I'm just ordinary. But I can draw. So I used it. I drew a picture of his dog Bleep and enclosed it to the letter.'

Despite their friendship, Andrea admitted she often thinks of his victims and their families, and found it 'heart-breaking' seeing his crimes depicted on television

She began exchanging letters with the killer, adding that he would 'open up' to her 'as much as he legally could'.  

'Frankly, I'm not entirely sure how it happened,' she told. 'I received the first response from him which I didn't expect.

'I did write back and it all happened from there. We just started exchanging letters. I opened up, he opened up, as much as he legally could.'

Despite their friendship, Andrea admits she often thinks of his victims and their families, and found it 'heart-breaking' seeing his crimes depicted on television. 

When asked whether she thinks about his victims and their families, she said: 'Course I do.

'I did watch the documentary yesterday. It was heart-breaking seeing all of those people speaking about their loved ones. It was difficult.'

Andrea admitted that the serial killer came across as an 'ordinary old man', and that he made her 'feel comfortable' after their first meeting. 

When asked what the killer was like in real life, she said:  'Ordinary, he came across as a normal old man. He was a bit annoyed because I was late for a visit. 

'But afterwards he could see I was nervous and he did everything he could to make me feel comfortable – joking around, he was laughing. 

'He was just friendly. He came across as a nice person. I know it's odd in the context, but yeah he was.'
