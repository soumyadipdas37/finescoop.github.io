Ellie showed off her still-glowing tan and her toned curves in the tiny set.

Pouting for the camera, the Love Island favourite completed her look with poker-straight locks and glam makeup as she snapped the photo in her hallway mirror. 

She later revealed she was staying in a plush hotel for the night, snapping another mirror photo as she held up a takeaway drink while dressed in a bathrobe.

'Really gassed with my hotel room' she captioned the photo posted to her Stories.

Ellie recently raged about her relationship with her EOTB co-star Michael Griffiths, who revealed the blonde 'hated' him for going on dates just days after their split.

The former couple lifted the lift on their failed romance while appearing on The Reality Tea podcast together.

Love Island's Michael, 28, admitted: 'Ellie hated me for a little bit. Not immediately after it happened, but it was for a while until last month. Yeah, pretty much December.

'So I'll explain it from my my point. So from the get go, I said to Ellie that I didn't want anything to kind of progress any way because I thought that I would hurt her.'

Interrupting, the outspoken beauty agreed: 'Yeah, when we left the villa we said we weren't in a relationship. That was always like set in stone.'
