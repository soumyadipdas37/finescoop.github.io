A trainee lawyer has praised the 'gentlemen' Chris Eubank and David Haye for coming to her rescue when she was hit by a Mercedes. 

Armandine Pohecoula, 25, was struck by the car on the Albert Embankment on her way home to south London on Tuesday when the two champion boxers rushed to her aid.

Eubank, 54, and Haye, 39, had not been together and it was pure coincidence that the two titans were on hand to wait with the young woman until an ambulance arrived. 

Speaking from home, Ms Pohecoula told The Sun: 'When I fell onto the road someone came out to help, I didn't know who he was. He kept asking "are you OK, are you OK?"

The boxers waited until the woman was reached by ambulance crews they flagged down

'After about ten minutes someone leaned over to me and said that he was famous. Obviously I now realise that that man was Chris Eubank.

'I was in a lot of pain but he kept telling me that help was coming. He held my hand and stayed with me for about twenty minutes.

'Then David came and asked if everything was alright and if I was OK. It was all a bit of a blur.'

Ms Pohecoula said that she was quite bruised on her arms and legs but was fine otherwise. 

She added: 'I just want to thank them both for being gentlemen. Lots of people walked past but they didn't hesitate to help.' 

Eubank played down any suggestion he was a hero - insisting he had just been down his civic duty along with his friend, Haye. 

Team-up: David Haye and Chris Eubank were both on the scene to help the injured woman

Eubank told The Sun he'd heard some a bang and was the first to get there and comforted Ms Pohecoula on the ground.

It was soon after that Haye appeared, asking: 'Can I help too.'

Haye said he'd been walking up to a meeting in Soho from his hotel south of the river when he'd spotted the commotion.

The former heavyweight champion added that Eubank had it all under control in any case, 'he is a sheriff after all,' Haye said. 

Eubank is indeed a city marshal in Opelousas, Louisiana, and has the right to arrest people. 

It is not clear whether the police are investigating the incident.
