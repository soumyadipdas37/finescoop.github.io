The finale of The Masked Singer was filmed in Melbourne's Docklands on Tuesday.

But there wasn't much fanfare as the cast and crew arrived on set, two weeks after production was abruptly suspended due to a coronavirus outbreak.

The assistants looked rather sombre as they carried costumes and racks of clothing inside, while COVID-19 safety marshals checked everybody's temperature.

Meanwhile, judges Dave Hughes and Dannii Minogue arrived wearing face masks, which are now mandatory in public spaces throughout Victoria.

Host Osher Günsberg and panellist Jackie 'O' Henderson were not present, as they filmed their segments from a Channel 10 studio in Sydney.

The fourth judge, Urzila Carlson, is believed to have Zoomed in from New Zealand.

Filming is believed to have continued until the early hours of the morning, as Jackie revealed on her KIIS FM breakfast show on Wednesday that she hadn't slept.

The bookies' favourite to win the show is The Queen, who is widely rumoured to be singer-songwriter Kate Miller-Heidke.

Production at Docklands Studios had been suspended on August 22 after a COVID-19 outbreak on set, and the entire cast and crew went into self-isolation.

'Production on The Masked Singer has been immediately suspended as a result of several crew members receiving a positive test result for COVID-19,' a Channel 10 spokesperson said at the time.

'The health and safety of the community, and our staff and production partners is our number one priority.'

The Masked Singer grand finale will air Monday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
