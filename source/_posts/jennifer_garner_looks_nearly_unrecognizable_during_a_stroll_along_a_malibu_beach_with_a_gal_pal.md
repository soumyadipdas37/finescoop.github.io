She's a single mom to three children, an acclaimed actress and producer, and co-founder of the organic, fresh baby food company Once Upon A Farm.

But on Saturday Jennifer Garner decided to take a healthy break from her busy schedule and go on a stroll along a beach in scenic Malibu with a gal pal. 

With the sun glaring down on another warm Southern California day, the Texas native wore cream-colored cut-off shorts and a black t-shirt with a colorful lightening bolt on the front.

Garner opted to go shoeless for her walk just feet from where the waves were crashing in on the sand.

Much of the time the Dallas Buyers Club star donned a red protective mask over her mouth and nose, but on occasion she pulled it down during her conversation with her friend. 

She also wore a grey baseball cap and dark sunglasses that, when added to the mask, made her nearly unrecognizable.

Her female friend donned a cozy and comfortable, all-black ensemble with a brown straw hat and sunglasses.

The pair appeared to be engulfed in deep conversation as they made their way along the sand, which included taking intermittent breaks from their chit-chat to dip their feet in the Pacific Ocean.

Although Garner is best known for her array of characters in both film and television, she has been spending a good deal of time in recent years helping build Once Upon A Farm. 

Part of her duties includes keeping up with her family farm in Oklahoma that she re-purchased in 2018 that helps supply fresh fruits and vegetables for the company.

Even with her success as an entrepreneur, Garner has continued to attach herself to a number of Hollywood projects like the HBO comedy series Camping (2018), the action thriller film Peppermint (2018), and as one the leading voice roles in the animated adventure film Wonder Park (2019).         

Her upcoming comedy film, Yes Day, starring Edgar Ramírez, Jenna Ortega, Julian Lerner, Megan Scott, June Diane Raphael and Nat Faxon, is currently in post-production.  She also served as one of the producers of the movie, which is based on a Children's book of the same name by Amy Krouse Rosenthal. 

Garner is the mother to daughters Violet, 14, and Seraphina, 11, and son Samuel, eight, whom she shares with ex-husband Ben Affleck, 48.
