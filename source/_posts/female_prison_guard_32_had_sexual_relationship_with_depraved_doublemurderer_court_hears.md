A female prison guard has appeared in court accused of having sex with a convicted double murderer.

Lauren McIntyre is alleged to have been involved in a sexual relationship with inmate Andrew Roberts over a four-month period.

The 32-year-old, from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, is also accused of 'sanctioning' the beating of a fellow officer by her lover.

Prison guard Lauren McIntyre, 32, is alleged to have been involved in a sexual relationship with inmate Andrew Roberts, who is a convicted double murderer, over a four month period

The alleged offences took place while the prison guard was working at HMP Isle of Wight in Albany, Newport - less than two miles from the courtroom she appeared in last week.

Roberts was convicted in 2003 of strangling his girlfriend Louise L'Homme and their eight month old daughter Tia to death at their home in Rhondda, South Wales.

Their bodies were found under an upturned bed at their terraced house after Roberts went on the run.

It was reported Roberts sprayed aftershave or perfume on the corpses to hide the smell of decomposition before he fled and was arrested five days later. 

The drug addict - then 22 - was sentenced to two life terms at Swansea Crown Court by a judge who accused him of carrying out the 'depraved and brutal destruction of your own family'.

Appearing in the dock at Isle of Wight Magistrates Court in a light green dress McIntyre - believed to be a mother of two - spoke only to confirm her name and date of birth.

She was granted unconditional bail until her next court hearing, which will take place at Newport Crown Court next month.

McIntyre is accused of wilfully and without reasonable excuse or justification misconducting herself in a way which amounted to an abuse of the public's trust in the office holder.

It is alleged that McIntyre had a sexual relationship with Roberts and she failed to report to anyone that she knew he was in possession of a mobile phone.

Not only did she allegedly know he had a phone, she is also said to have provided Roberts with her mobile number, communicated with him and sent him a picture of herself.

She is also accused of 'sanctioning a beating' by Roberts of another prison officer, Samuel Laidler - who is believed to live on the Isle of Wight.

McIntyre is alleged to have given Roberts Mr Laidler's personal mobile number and didn't warn the guard that he might be in danger of an 'impending' attack.

It is also claimed that she attempted to allow Roberts to transfer money into her bank account and failed to report 'misconduct and corruption' in other members of staff.

The offences are said to have taken place in 2018 between August and December.

HMP Isle of Wight, Albany Barracks, is a Category B men's prison, with a population of around 1,000. Almost 98 per cent of those prisoners are sex offenders.
