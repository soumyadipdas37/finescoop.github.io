Filming on the 2021 season of Married At First Sight is well and truly underway, with the latest batch of participants spotted heading to one of the show's notorious dinner parties.

The show's cast was spotted arriving at a factory in Sydney's Lilyfield on Wednesday, with a fleet of black hire cars ferrying them to the location.

While the participants for the upcoming series are yet to be officially announced, they've reportedly already filmed the show's weddings and honeymoons.
