James Rodriguez claims he is a better player now than when shooting to stardom at the 2014 World Cup — and says he is ready to dazzle at Goodison.

Everton’s flurry of transfer activity over the past week has included arguably the biggest signing they have ever made with Rodriguez, who won the Golden Boot in Brazil six years ago, arriving from Real Madrid for around £14million.

A new start after an injury-hit few seasons has the potential to be invigorating and the 29-year-old believes he can get back to the heights he once scaled. 

Everton landed James Rodriguez for around £14million from Real Madrid this summer

The midfielder built his reputation off a stunning World Cup with Colombia in 2014 where in Brazil he finished as the tournament's top goal scorer

Crucially, so does Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti and Rodriguez cannot wait to get started.

‘I’m someone who wants to play more, to show quality,’ said Rodriguez. ‘Six years ago I had something good, a good level. I hope being here lets it happen again.

‘In football it is not only you. You have to have people next to you who are with you. I spoke to Carlo and it was good for me to be able to play again. This is a club with fans and passion.’
