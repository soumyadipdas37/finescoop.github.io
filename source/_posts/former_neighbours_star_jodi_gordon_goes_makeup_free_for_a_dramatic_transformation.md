Former Neighbours star Jodi Gordon is good friends with beauty king Max Made. 

And the 35-year-old went makeup free before undergoing a dramatic transformation at the hands of the makeup artist this week. 

On Tuesday, Jodi was the prefect canvas as she sat in the chair for Max, who did a soft glam look for the soap actress.

Sitting in the chair, Max put his skills to good use as he glammed up Jodi with a number of his favourite products. 

Max first focused on a luminous glow for Jodi, using the hyaluronic serum and luminous silk foundation. 

He then moved on to using a contour stick applied around the face, along with creamy concealer for the dewy look.

He finished with a nude blush and a liquid lipstick. Jodi appeared more than pleased with the masterful transformation. 

It comes after a big change for the star, after she split from her lawyer boyfriend Cedric late last month, following six months of dating.  

A close friend confirmed the split to Daily Mail Australia in August, but said they 'still remain good friends'.

 Jodi and Cedric were first spotted together on July 3 enjoying a loved-up dinner date at Bondi's RAW bar.

At the time, Jodi could not wipe the smile off her face as she nestled in close to her former beau while leaving the Japanese eatery.

According to an insider, the glam mother-of-one was 'happier than ever' after meeting the Swiss lawyer.

The pair began dating earlier this year after Jodi moved back to Sydney from Melbourne to be closer to her daughter Aleeia, six, shared with ex-husband Braith Anasta.

A source close to the pair revealed at the time that Jodi was 'beaming with joy' over Cedric.

'She's head over heels. They've been dating for a few months now, but things are still in the very early stages of their relationship,' they said.  

Change: She announced in January she was leaving her role as Elly Conway after three years on the soap 

Jodi has had an eventful past year after sensationally quitting her high-profile acting role on Neighbours. 

Jodi and her ex-husband Braith, 38, announced their split at the end of 2015, stating that they would 'remain best of friends' for the sake of their daughter.

Prior to Braith, Jodi had a high-profile relationship with Channel Seven heir Ryan Stokes.
