She's got a heavy schedule on her plate as she prepares to direct two movies back to back.

But Olivia Wilde is making time to pursue her passion for horse riding as Hollywood production remains mostly shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The actress and director, 36, enjoyed her regular equestrian session on Sunday in Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles.

She had on a safety helmet and had a blue face mask with her which she wore when necessary.

Wilde shares two children - Daisy , three, and Otis, six - with her partner Jason Sudeikis.

In 2019, Wilde made her feature directorial debut with the high school comedy Booksmart which garnered plenty of buzz and critical acclaim.

Next up, she's set to helm as well as star in the psychological thriller Don't Worry, Darling about an unhappy 1950s housewife.

The film is highly anticipated since Harry Styles, Dakota Johnson, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine have all signed on to star. 

And earlier this month, it was announced that Wilde has signed a deal to direct a Marvel movie for Sony Pictures which is believed to center on Spider-Woman.

The in demand star is also attached to direct an as-yet untitled holiday movie for Universal Pictures.
