TV presenter Grant Denyer's wife Chezzi has been left outraged after receiving rude comments from strangers about her decision to fall pregnant at 40. 

Posting to Instagram on Tuesday, Chezzi shared examples of the disgraceful comments she's received from strangers in her hometown of Bathurst, New South Wales, since announcing her third pregnancy last month.  

'I am 40 years old and having a baby... I live in country NSW and get comments like... 'Why, would you at your age?' 'Was it an accident?' 'Are you worried something will be wrong with the baby?'', she lamented.

An impolite former schoolmate had even told her: 'I went to school with you, and my 2nd grandchild is due the same month as you!'  

 TV producer Chezzi, who shares daughters Scout, four, and Sailor, eight, with husband Grant, explained that despite the negativity, she has received plenty of positive messages from friends living in other parts of Australia.  

'But on the flip side, many of my friends 40+ living in Sydney or Melbourne are only now trying to have their first child,' she explained.

'We endured 3 miscarriages': Chezzi explained she'd tried to fall pregnant before turning 40, before three tragic miscarriages made this goal impossible 

'I hear comments from them like this... 'You're so young to have 3 children!' 'How did you manage to have a baby at 30 years of age?' 'I just wouldn't have been ready!' 

Chezzi explained she'd tried to fall pregnant before turning 40, before three tragic miscarriages made this goal impossible.  

'We tried for over 12months to fall pregnant, and we endured three miscarriages throughout that period. It was the first month we stopped trying that we actually fell pregnant this time, she said. 

'I have that sexy label - 'geriatric mother!' In true Chezzi style, the bubbly star completed her post with a touch of humour 

In true Chezzi style, the bubbly star completed her post with a touch of humour.  

'When I had Scout 5 years ago I was labelled a 'geriatric mother' in the medical profession. And again this time I have that sexy label - 'geriatric mother'!' she mused. 

'But I'm pretty calm and confident this time around.. there's something you don't have when you're really young and that is wisdom.. and my ripe old age of 40 I feel I have plenty,' she declared.  

Grant and Chezzi's baby is due on March 1, 2021.
