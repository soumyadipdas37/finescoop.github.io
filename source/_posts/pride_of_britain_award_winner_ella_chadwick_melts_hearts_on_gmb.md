Pride of Britain Award winner Ella Chadwick melted hearts this morning during a Good Morning Britain appearance to celebrate her 13th birthday.  

Ella, from Rochdale, was born with congenital nephrotic syndrome, a rare kidney disease, and stole the show when she won the Child of Courage award at the Pride of Britain ceremony in 2018.  

She recently celebrated her birthday, and appeared with her mother Karen to reveal that her day was spent with an afternoon tea and birthday cake with joke candles at home, where she is still shielding amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Ella was on dialysis for six years and has undergone more than 40 operations, including two kidney transplants, donated by her father and grandmother. She has diabetes and is dependent on a walking frame and a wheelchair. 

Viewers quickly took to Twitter to praise the 13-year-old and wish her a happy birthday, with one hailing her an 'inspirational young girl' while another called her a 'ray of sunshine'.

Ella went on: 'And I opened some presents, which were an iPad and a book and as you can see these are my candles. But they wouldn't blow out so I had to say "help me please", and we had some party food which was so delicious, and we all like parties sometimes'

Karen went on to admit that while she missed her friends, lockdown wasn't too much of a 'shock' for Ella, because she's spent so much time in hospital during her transplants. 

'She's been okay', said Karen, 'We've kept busy she did lots of laps in the garden to raise money for the NHS, so that kept her busy. 

'It hasn't been as much of a shock as she spent so many months in hospital having transplants, but with friends and events she'd normally do that's been the hardest part really.' 

Ella and mother Karen went on to tell host Ben Shepherd (pictured) about their support for the Share Your Wishes campaign during Transplant Week

Ella and mother Karen went on to throw their support behind the Share Your Wishes campaign during Transplant Week.

'We've been involved with Share Your Wishes on social media', said Karen, 'Just for people to talk to their families and let them know if they would like to donate their organs.

So it's a campaign for people to sit down have a brew and talk to their family.'
