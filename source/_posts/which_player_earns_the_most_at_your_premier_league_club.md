Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has become the joint-highest paid player at Arsenal after signing his new deal. 

The Gunners captain will now take home a weekly wage of £350,000, matching the terms the club gave to Mesut Ozil in January 2018. 

It means there is just one player in the Premier League who earns more than the Gabon international, with Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea out on his own with earnings of £375,000-a-week. 

Arsenal are not the only club pushing the boat out when it comes to contracts, however, with several clubs giving new signings the coveted place atop the wage list this summer.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the highest earners at each of the top flight's 20 teams.  

1= Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang £350,000-a-week 1= Mesut Ozil £350,000-a-week 3. Willian £220,000-a-week

As explained above, Aubameyang now sits pretty at the top of the Arsenal pay charts, and fans will be delighted to see him pen a new deal.

What they will now hope is that their star striker's Gunners career doesn't go the same way as their previous big earner. 

Mesut Ozil still earns the same as Aubameyang, but his contribution at the Emirates since signing his new deal has been underwhelming to say the least. 

Rounding off the top three at Arsenal, new signing Willian already appears to be justifying his pay after a hat-trick of assists on the opening day.  

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has signed a new deal at the Emirates to make him the top earner

1. Jack Grealish £135,000-a-week 2. Ollie Watkins £75,000-a-week 3. Matty Cash £65,000-a-week

Having only just put pen to paper on a new deal himself, Jack Grealish has ended a summer of controversy and courtship by snubbing the advances of Manchester United to become Aston Villa's top earner.

Ollie Watkins has been handed a sizeable wage too, according to reports, after his move from Bournemouth, while new Matty Cash has also been well renumerated after swapping Nottingham Forest for Villa Park.

1. Adam Lallana £90,000-a-week 2= Pascal Gross £50,000-a-week 2= Alireza Jahanbakhsh £50,000-a-week

It was documented that Adam Lallana had been forced to take a wage cut from Liverpool in order to join Brighton, but it is still acknowledged that he is now the top earner at the Amex, and comfortably so.

Graham Potter has seen the powers that be smash their wage structure in a bid to provide him with a bit more creativity going forward. That responsibility used to fall to Pascal Gross, who is the club's second-highest earner on £50,000-a-week. 

He is joined on that figure by Iranian Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who completes the Seagulls' top three.  

1. Ben Mee £55,000-a-week 2= James Tarkowski £50,000-a-week 2= Chris Wood £50,000-a-week

Burnley are beginning their fifth consecutive season in the Premier League under Sean Dyche, but they are still keeping those pursestrings tight when it comes to wages.

Dyche has always steered away from splashing the cash and has found consistency working under a small budget, in comparison to clubs they come up against week in, week out. 

As a result the earnings at Turf Moor appear fairly modest when compared to the rest of the league. Captain Ben Mee earns the most, taking home £55,000-a-week.

Behind him, England interational James Tarkowski and striker Chris Wood both earn £50,000.  

1. Ben Chilwell £190,000-a-week 2. Timo Werner £175,000-a-week 3= Kepa Arrizabalaga £150,000-a-week 3= N'Golo Kante £150,000-a-week

This is probably the biggest surprise on the list, but is yet another indication of how Chelsea were able to wield their spending power once more this summer. 

Ben Chilwell, who joined in a £50million deal from Leicester City this summer, has signed a deal that is worth up to £190,000-a-week to the England full back.

That takes him above fellow newboy Timo Werner in the list of top earners.

Before the summer, it had been goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and midfielder N'Golo Kante who had jointly held the position of top earner at Stamford Bridge. 

Ben Chilwell earns up to £190,000-a-week after joining Chelsea from Leicester City 

1. Wilfried Zaha £130,000-a-week  2. Max Meyer £125,000-a-week 3. Christian Benteke £110,000-a-week

It should be of no surprise to find out who the top earner at Crystal Palace is, with Wilfried Zaha the club's prized possession. 

He looks set to stay at Selhurst Park beyond this summer, despite his desire to move elsewhere, with coronavirus pandemic cautioning clubs against matching or bettering his £130,000-a-week deal at Palace.

Behind him Max Meyer received a hefty £125,000-a-week deal when he joined on a free deal from Schalke, while Christian Benteke is still on £110,000-a-week following his move from Liverpool in 2016. 

Wilfried Zaha looks set to stay at Crystal Palace this summer, and is still their top earner

1= Bernard £120,000-a-week 1= Yerry Mina £120,000-a-week 3. Andre Gomes £112,000-a-week

A disclaimer to start here; this could be wrong. 

Everton have splashed the cash on some big names to revamp their squad under Carlo Ancelotti this summer, with James Rodriguez, Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure all coming through the door. 

While it has been widely reported that Rodriguez took a significant cut on his £140,000-a-week Real Madrid wages to move to Goodison Park, the extent of that cut is unclear, while there has been little said about the payment structures for both Allan and Doucoure.

It means, as far as we know, Brazilian Bernard is still the top Toffees earner alongside defender Yerry Mina. Andre Gomes is third.  

1. Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa £67,000-a-week 2. Jean-Michael Seri £65,000-a-week 3. Aleksandar Mitrovic £60,000-a-week

Fulham were left counting the cost of some aggressive purchasing when they fell out of the Premier League in 2019.

Back again, their top earners are all big signings from that season back in 2018-19. 

Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa spent last season away from the club on loan as they pursuaded Villarreal to the majority of his wages for their season in the Championship. 

Jean-Micharl Seri was another expensive purchase who spent the previous campaign away from the club, while Aleksandar Mitrovic completes the top three. 

1. Rodrigo £120,000-a-week 2. Helder Costa £70,000-a-week 3. Patrick Bamford £55,000-a-week

Back in the big-time, Leeds sent out a statement of intent by landing Valencia striker Rodrigo.

It took some doing, with the Spain international immediately soaring to the top of their wage structure, earning a reported £120,000-a-week at Elland Road. 

Helder Costa, who signed permanently following his loan move from Wolves, has also jumped into the top three, ahead of striker Patrick Bamford.

Leeds United have agreed to pay Rodrigo £120,000-a-week following his move from Valencia

1. Jamie Vardy £140,000-a-week 2. Kasper Schmeichel £130,000-a-week 3. James Maddison £100,000-a-week

Having just signed a new one-year extension, Jamie Vardy remains the highest paid player at Leicester City. 

After playing such a pivotal role in the club's unprecedented Premier League title, Vardy has been rewarded for his continuing presence at the top of the scoring charts. 

Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel is not far behind him in the earning charts, while England international James Maddison recently put pen to paper on a new £100,000-a-week deal to ward of interest from the likes of Manchester United. 

1. Mohamed Salah £220,000-a-week 2. Virgil van Dijk £180,000-a-week 3= Alisson  £150,000-a-week 3= Sadio Mane £150,000-a-week

For their level of performances over the past couple of seasons, some of Liverpool's top stars may be questioning the gap between their earnings and those from other clubs in the top six. 

Mohamed Salah is the biggest earner at Anfield, while Virgil van Dijk is second. 

Also earning the big bucks are goalkeeper Alisson and forward Sadio Mane, who have both been key to the club's success in Europe and the Premier League over the past two seasons. 

Mohamed Salah is the highest-paid player at Anfield, taking home £220,000-a-week

1. Raheem Sterling £300,000-a-week 2. Kevin De Bruyne £280,000-a-week 3. Sergio Aguero £220,000-a-week

For his leadership on and off the field, Raheem Sterling's position as Manchester City's highest paid player is more than justified. 

The England winger signed his latest deal in 2018, with the terms keeping him at the club until at least 2023, on a deal that earns him up to £300,000-a-week. 

Reports have suggested that City are keen on tying down Kevin De Bruyne to a new contract, which could potentially take him above Sterling at the top of the list. For now though, he has to make do with being the club's second-highest paid player.

Striker Sergio Aguero, who has entered his last year at the Etihad, is third. 

Raheem Sterling earns up to £300,000-a-week at Manchester City as part of his deal 

1. David De Gea £375,000-a-week 2. Paul Pogba £290,000-a-week 3. Anthony Martial £250,000-a-week

Not only the top earner at United, but the top earner in the league, David de Gea boasts the highest wage of any player in England.

His mammoth £375,000-a-week pay was put in place to ward off interest from Real Madrid, though his position is now under threat from the returning Dean Henderson.

Paul Pogba is also on a sizeable wage, earning £290,000-a-week, while his fellow Frenchman Anthony Martial is sat on £250,000-a-week.

David de Gea is the highest-paid star in the Premier League, earning £375,000-a-week

1. Callum Wilson £75,000-a-week 2. Ryan Fraser £70,000-a-week 3. Jonjo Shelvey £70,000-a-week

Mike Ashley has always been insistent on drawing a line in the sand when it comes to wages at St James' Park. 

However, his stance appears to have softened during this window, with Newcastle badly in need of some fresh faces. 

Reports have suggested the club broke their pay ceiling - set at £70,000-a-week - to land both Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser - with the former reportedly asking for £75,000 in negotiations.

Jonjo Shelvey was the only player on £70,000 before the latest arrivals.  

Newcastle broke through their own wage ceiling in order to land Callum Wilson this summer

1. Phil Jagielka £50,000-a-week 2. Lys Moussett £25,000-a-week 3. Oliver McBurnie £20,000-a-week

On returning to Bramall Lane last season, defender Phil Jagielka was made the club's highest paid player after 12 years away. 

His wages are reportedly double that of the second-highest earner, striker Lys Moussett, while Oli McBurnie completes their modest top earners.  

1. Danny Ings £75,000-a-week 2= Ryan Bertrand £70,000-a-week 2= Fraser Forster £70,000-a-week

Danny Ings was well renumerated when he decided to switch Anfield for St Mary's and he has paid Southampton back in kind with his performances in front of goal.

The England striker is the top earner at the south coast club, with his fellow international Ryan Bertrand the next highest. 

Fraser Forster is also on top wages having signed a new deal in 2017, despite his value to the squad having diminished, spending last season on loan at Celtic. 

1. Harry Kane £200,000-a-week 2. Tanguy Ndombele £160,000-a-week 3. Son Heung-min £140,000-a-week

Daniel Levy has always proved a tough negotiator, and it shows with the wages available for a club that had consistently experienced Champions League football for the past four seasons.

Harry Kane, as to be expected, is the club's top earner with £200,000-a-week, an amount that states his importance to the north London club. 

That is a good £40,000-a-week more than their second-highest earner, Tanguy Ndombele who joined from Lyon last summer. 

There is no room for Dele Alli in the top earners, with Son Heung-min taking the third spot.  

Harry Kane is the best-paid player at Tottenham by some distance, earning £220,000-a-week

1. Charlie Austin £70,000-a-week 2. Kieran Gibbs £55,000-a-week 3. Jake Livermore £46,000-a-week

Despite spending last season in the Championship, there is still plenty of Premier League pedigree at the top of the West Brom wage structure.

Charlie Austin was key in firing them back into the top-flight last season, and is the highest-paid player at the Hawthorns, ahead of England internationals Kieran Gibbs and Jake Livermore.  

1. Andriy Yarmalenko £115,000-a-week 2. Sebastien Haller £105,000-a-week 3. Jack WIlshere £100,000-a-weel

West Ham's pay structure is dominated by their foreign imports, with Ukraine international Andriy Yarmalenko their top earner, and striker Sebastien Haller second.

Jack Wilshere is still in there at the moment, but with the club moving to cancel his contract, it coulf be all change at the top of the Hammers' tree in the coming days. 

1= Joao Moutinho £100,000-a-week 1= Rui Patricio £100,000-a-week 3. Leander Dendoncker £90,000-a-week

Wolves' Portuguese stars are among the highest-paid at Molineux, with internationals Joao Moutinho and goalkeeper Rui Patricio earning £100,000-a-week each. 

Midfielder Leander Dendoncker makes up the top three, earning £10,000-a-week less than the two Euro 2016 winners.
