She is set to make her debut as Princess Diana in the fourth series of The Crown later this year.

And Emma Corrin looked effortlessly demure as she joined Hollywood's elite for the 77th Venice Film Festival at The Excelsior on Monday. 

The actress, 24, showed off her sense of style in a £625 nautical-inspired shirt, which she teamed with an ankle length leather skirt -all from Miu Miu.

Emma added a boost to her height with monochrome heels which were embellished with jewels on the straps. 

As she arrived by boat, the Netflix star shielded her eyes from the sun with tortoise shell sunglasses and carried a black bag. 

Emma appeared in high spirits as she gave a friendly wave before taking to the stage with Cats star Francesca Hayar.

Miu Miu has commissioned two films a year since 2011, one for their summer collection and one for the winter collection, and use the fashion brand's designs in them.

The women who direct them are given free reign when it comes to making the movies.

Since 2012, all of the winter collection films have had their world premiere at the Venice Days section of the Venice International Film Festival.  

Last month, fans got their first glimpse of Emma as Princess Diana.

The 30-second preview hinted there could be dark times ahead for the monarchy as Olivia Colman's Queen Elizabeth II warns it is 'too important to fail.'

Despite concerns the fourth series could be delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the trailer confirms that The Crown's fourth series will be released on Sunday, November 15th. 

The brief preview features a voiceover of The Queen, as she emerges from Buckingham Palace on horseback, saying: 'Something as important as monarchy simply cannot be allowed to fail.'

Happy: Emma appeared in high spirits as she gave a friendly wave before taking to the stage with Cats star Francesca Hayar

Understated:  Emma showcased her natural beauty with a minimal make-up look and wore a glittering emerald green ring

Safety first: Emma donned a face mask as she left the hotel 

Trendy: Francesca also looked stylish in a green tweed dress with puff-ball sleeves 

Long legs: She wore electric blue eye-shadow and showed off her leggy frame in the plaid minidress 

It then cuts to a glimpse of Gillian Anderson as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with the series set to begin in the late 1970s, at the beginning of her rise to power.

But a majority of the trailer focuses on Emma's depiction of Lady Diana Spencer, who would eventually become Princess Of Wales, one of the most iconic figures in Royal History.  

The fourth series will document her blossoming romance with Prince Charles, as the trailer features the moment she emerges to greet an army of photographers, along with crowds cheering her name as she travels the world on behalf of the monarchy.

It's here! Fans got a glimpse of Emma  as Princess Diana in her iconic wedding gown last month (left in the trailer and right in 1981)

This includes Diana's 1983 tour of Australia, when she famously donned a beautiful fuchsia pink dress. 

The preview ends with a glimpse of Diana's iconic David Emmanuel wedding dress, which will take centre stage as The Crown recreates her historic 1981 wedding.

The Crown Series Four will begin as the 1970s are drawing to a close, with the Royal Family preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles who is still unmarried at 30.
