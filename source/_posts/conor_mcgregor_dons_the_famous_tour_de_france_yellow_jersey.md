Sharing his excitement at taking part, McGregor posted earlier this summer: 'A Great day racing the water bikes with Princess Charlene of Monaco. 

'A phenomenal athlete and Olympian, we are teaming up for a 180km voyage in September to raise awareness in water safety. I cannot wait!

'We will be utilising my training under the McGregor F.A.S.T program to excel on these mounted water bike devices, which are incredibly good! It is like Freedom out there! Thank you for the great day for my family Your Highness.'
