It's set to return later this year after filming for the new season ended last month.

And the first official still from The Great British Bake Off was released on Tuesday, and saw judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith as well as co-hosts Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding pose with cake.

The comedian, 46, is set to make his debut as presenter after replacing Sandi Toksvig, and he showed off his funny side by balancing a cupcake on his head.

Matt looked delighted as he held up a plate of the delectably treats, and posed beside celebrity chef Paul who posed with a chocolate gateaux.

Prue, meanwhile, looked chic in a bright blue blazer that she paired with a colourful striped shirt and black jeans as she held up another platter of sweet treats.

Noel showed off his eccentric sense of style by posing in an oversized black-and-blue floral print shirt and black skinny jeans.

IT'S BACK! The first trailer for The Great British Bake Off was released earlier this month

Last month, GBBO revealed they had finished filming for the upcoming series by posting a picture of the iconic kitchen to Instagram, they penned: 'Filming has wrapped on the new series of The Great British Bake Off. More news soon...' 

Filming for the next season began in August at a private location in Essex, just a stone's throw from judge Paul Hollywood's home. 

Despite being considered a high-risk candidate for coronavirus, his co-host, Judge Prue still presented on this year's show.

Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air.

She credited stringent health and safety measures, testing and quarantine regimes for the return of the hit baking series.   

Meanwhile it was previously reported that judge Paul wants to continue using his trademark handshake in the upcoming season, despite fears of spreading coronavirus.  

At the time, Channel 4 clarified they will follow strict safety protocol so that all parties are free to handshake to their heart's content.

According to a report in The Sun, Paul was given the green light to handshake cast members as producers believe the show wouldn't be the same without his signature move.

To ensure safety at all times, the upcoming season was filmed in an isolation bubble, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing. 

A source said: 'In these strange times, producers want the 2020 series to be as close to normal as possible and they feel that it wouldn’t be the same without a Hollywood handshake. 

'The judges and hosts — and the contestants — have all been deemed clear because of the bio-secure bubble and regular testing.

'So if the baking is up to scratch, we’ll see some handshakes, and not elbow bumps, being dished out before long.'

Paul's handshake is widely regarded as the golden ticket for bakers who aim to meet his high expectations or win Star Baker of the week. 

The first time that fans witnessed Paul's congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. 

The program was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.
