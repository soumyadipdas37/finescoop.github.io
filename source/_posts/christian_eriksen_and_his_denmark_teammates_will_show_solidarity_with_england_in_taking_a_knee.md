Christian Eriksen will show solidarity with England in taking a knee on Tuesday night, despite an escalating political row in Denmark.

The former Tottenham midfielder says the Danish players want to support the anti-racism protests after revealing the English FA asked them to back the Black Lives Matter campaign ahead of the Nations League match.

But a controversy has been simmering in his homeland as Morten Messerschmidt, deputy chairman of the Danish People’s Party, said it is ‘dangerous’ to mix sport and politics.

That has caused a major debate in Denmark but the players, according to Eriksen, want to take a knee.

Inter Milan star Eriksen: ‘I do not see why it should be a problem of any kind at all. We all support the fight against all forms of racism.

‘And if it can create a little extra focus, then I think we could do it.’

Denmark midfielder Thomas Delaney said it is a 'no brianer' to support the movement

Denmark’s Borussia Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney also said it was a ‘no brainer’ and they should do it no matter the possible implications after the final whistle.

‘I think it is quite nice that politics and sports — when we are in such situations here at least — are mixed together,’ Delaney said.

‘It was a wish from the English, which we support. This is the information that we have decided on. So we have to see what happens afterwards.

‘As I said, it was the wish of the English. They had asked UEFA if we wanted to join it, and we would very much like that.’
