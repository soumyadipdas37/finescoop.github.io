She recently broke up with Timm Hanly after meeting the hunk on Bachelor in Paradise. 

But now, Brittany Hockley is focusing on herself and enjoying a sunny getaway in Byron Bay. 

The reality star, 32, took some time to answer some fan questions on Instagram on Monday, when one follower asked how she bought a house when she was just 22. 

Back in paradise! The Bachelor's Britanny Hockley (pictured) took some time out of her Byron Bay vacation to explain how she bought a house at just 22 years old to a fan

'Firstly, it's okay if you don't have a house at 22. It's okay if you never have a house, it's fine!' she said.

'Literally no secret here. I worked really hard, got a big fat mortgage, continued to work really hard, sold my house and my big fat mortgage and then went travelling and then continued to work hard.'

In the caption, Brittany said she 'took a risk' when she invested in property for the first time. 

'I just worked and saved from a really young age and got lucky with a great property. And no, I wasn't given a cent,' she said.   

'Also, having a house isn't indicative of success! Don't stress about this! What is right for one person may not be right for another!' 

Wise words: Brittany said she was able to buy a house by working and saving from an early age while also getting lucky with a great property and taking a risk on investing

The reality star is currently staying in Byron Bay with her friends who run sustainable fashion brand Zulu and Zephyr. 

She posted another Instagram story joking that she was dating Hollywood star Zac Efron, who has recently been living in Byron. 

'Zac, honey! Are you coming to bed yet?' she said in the clip, joking that she had to turn down The Bachelorette because of the relationship. 

Brittany has also been hanging out with fellow Bachelor star Laura Byrne, who is also enjoying a Byron getaway with her kids.

'We are cheating on each other and are with different people doing our own thing but still caught up!' Brittany said. 

The 32-year-old appeared on the latest season of Bachelor in Paradise where she began dating Timm Hanly.  

Bachelor in Paradise was filmed in Fiji from November to December last year, and aired on Channel 10 between July and August.

A few weeks after they left the show together, Timm 'ghosted' Brittany and reunited with his ex-girlfriend Briana De La Motte
