She's more loved-up than ever with her hunky boyfriend, Seb Guilhaus.

And to celebrate how smitten she is, Married At First Sight star Elizabeth Sobinoff decided to treat fans on Wednesday - with a seemingly nude photo of the reality hunk on her Instagram page.

'In case you are having a bad day I hope this brightens up your world,' the 29-year-old brunette teased to fans.

The image in question saw Seb flaunting his rippling muscles and sun-kissed glow - with the seductive photo cutting off just at his private area.

In an attempt to dispel rumours he was nude, Lizzie added: 'And yes, he has pants on!'

Fans in their masses were quick to comment on the saucy snap, with one writing: 'Oh how devastating for you, it must be difficult handing a body like this every day!'

'Oh dear Lord,' another simply wrote, while a third gushed: 'Put it away Seb!'

A fourth fan laughed: 'And this is why I love you - thank you for sharing!'

Elizabeth and Seb met while starring on her second season of Married At First Sight in 2020.

The pair were recently forced to spend three months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic, after she returned to Sydney for work while he stayed in Adelaide.

She said they ultimately stayed connected through 'constant texting' while apart, and finally reunited in June.

Last month, Elizabeth spoke about living with her boyfriend of seven months while appearing on the podcast, Fashion Avenue.

'I mean, it's just normal to get frustrated with everyone,' she said, before adding that she was 'loving' being with Seb in Sydney.

She continued: 'I'm actually in such a great place in my life at the moment. He's just amazing! And it's that bonding.'
