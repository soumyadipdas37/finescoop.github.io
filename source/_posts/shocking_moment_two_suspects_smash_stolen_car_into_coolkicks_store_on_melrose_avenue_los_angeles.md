A stolen car hit a street sign before smashing through the front of a sneaker store in Los Angeles overnight. 

Shocking video footage posted on social media shows a black vehicle being driven up the curb and knocking a street sign over.

The car then drives straight through the glass front of the CoolKicks sneaker store on Melrose Avenue.

A car, which police say was stolen, is driven onto the curb on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, before knocking a street sign over and shattering the glass front of a CoolKicks store, which had previously been raided during protests in May following the death of George Floyd

After breaking through the store front, the vehicle then reversed back out onto the street and then drove off.

Police have said that the vehicle used to smash into the sneaker store had been carjacked on Sunday night in the Venice area, according to ABC7.

The vehicle was then found after the crash abandoned only a few blocks away.

One suspect has been arrested by police and remains in custody while a witness claims another ran off into the neighbourhood after the crash.

In May, the same CoolKicks sneaker store was targeted and emptied out by looters following the death of George Floyd.

It is believed that no merchandise was taken from the store last night after being broken into. 

The vehicle then reverses out of the sneaker store again before driving off. It was found abandoned just a few blocks away
