Beau Ryan paid tribute to his three-year-old son, Jesse, in a sweet post on Instagram on National Sons Day on Monday.

The 35-year-old Amazing Race host shared a sweet message for his little boy after being reminded about the day by his friend, Australian footballer Tim Cahill. 

'Just spoke to my bro @tim_cahill and wherever he is in the world he told me it's "National Sons Day",' he began.

'My son has changed my life. (As has my nephew) He taught me what it is to be a Dad. A leader. A best mate. A protector. 

'I love him more than words and wherever you are now you should hug your son. Or ring your Dad. Tell him you love him.'

Beau also shared a series of affectionate photos of himself with his son, showing off their close bond.

The former professional rugby league footballer is also dad to a seven-year-old daughter, Remi, with his wife of eight years, Kara Ryan.

On Father's Day earlier this month, Beau shared a sweet photo of himself cuddling up to his two children in bed.

'No better feeling than being a Dad. I love it more than anything,' he wrote.

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Stellar Magazine last month, Beau spoke about how fatherhood had changed his life. 

'Having kids changes everything because you learn to put other people before yourself, which I never used to do when I was younger,' he explained. 

'Now, knowing there are three people I have to provide for and protect is how I look at it.

'I'm sort of used to coming last now. Whether it's food that's left over or a chair to sit on, you're the one who misses out. It's just what you do.'

In an interview with Who magazine in August 2018, Beau said he hoped his kids would continue to turn to him as he they got older.

'I just want to be a dad that Remi and Jesse can talk to about anything. It's really important for me that we share everything with each other,' he said. 

'Now, knowing there are three people I have to provide for and protect is how I look at it,' he said of parenthood. Pictured with his family, including wife Kara Ryan
