Beginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, different groups of trade unionists chose a variety of days on which to celebrate labor, according to Wikipedia. 

In the United States, a September holiday called Labor Day was first proposed in the early 1880s,' the site claimed.

The event originated in connection with a General Assembly of the Knights of Labor convened in New York City in September 1882, it was added.

The site shared: 'In connection with this clandestine Knights assembly, a public parade of various labor organizations was held on September 5 under the auspices of the Central Labor Union (CLU) of New York. 

'Secretary of the CLU Matthew Maguire is credited for first proposing that a national Labor Day holiday subsequently be held on the first Monday of each September in the aftermath of this successful public demonstration.'
