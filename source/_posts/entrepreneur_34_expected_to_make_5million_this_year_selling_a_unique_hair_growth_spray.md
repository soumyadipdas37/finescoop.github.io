Trung Vien launched Hair Folli in April 2020

A businessman is set to turn over $5million this year after launching a unique hair growth spray during the COVID-19 lockdown - and the customer results speak for themselves.

Trung Vien, 34, launched Hair Folli in April 2020 as a solution for adult hair loss, a problem many of his friends were having.

'Some of my pals were getting married, divorced, having kids or moving into management or executive roles, which caused them stress and in turn led to hair loss,' the Sydney man told FEMAIL.

The $67 signature spray works as a 'vasodilator' to open the hair follicles up and increase the rate of blood flowing through the scalp.

It contains native kakadu plum, which has 100 times the amount of vitamin C in an orange, licorice root extract, which is a natural anti-inflammatory, as well as nigella sativa seed extract, which increases circulation.

The company also sells a gold titanium roller which uses a process of microneedling to allow regeneration of hair follicles. It can be used on the hairline or beard area to promote growth.

'We know that having a quick fix is not the only solution and value a holistic approach too,' Trung said.

'We know that having a quick fix is not the only solution and value a holistic approach too,' Trung said (three week difference using the spray)

'Lifestyle and diet all make up this holistic approach. We've built a community on our social media from this.'

During the trial phase those that tested out the spray were seeing new hairs sprout in two weeks, but typically customers can expect results in 90 days. 

'I've been using Hair Folli spray for four weeks now, and thats all it takes to see the difference! I actually cut my own hair short every week, and my hair looks thicker and healthier still,' one customer wrote on the website.

'I came across an ad for this showing how it'd work for facial hair growth and decided to give it a shot. Happy to say it's definitely produced results for me. My beard has grown out much more evenly and looks fantastic,' said another.

A third added: 'My hair was becoming noticeably thinner, mainly on the top. Within a few weeks of using the spray I noticed my hair was thickening up nicely'.

Trung has plans to release eight more products in the coming 12 months but wants to ensure they are 'perfect' before bringing them to market

While the stress of a global pandemic, job losses and health woes has seen the brand become an instant success, there has been some struggles with mail delivery to certain states.  

'Most customers have usually been very understanding,' Trung said.

The company founder has never worked in e-commerce before but over the last decade has owned fast food chains like Dominos, a restaurant in Brisbane, gym and supplements. 

'All were successful multimillion-dollar turnover. Now I just focus on e-commerce and invest all that back in to property,' he said.
