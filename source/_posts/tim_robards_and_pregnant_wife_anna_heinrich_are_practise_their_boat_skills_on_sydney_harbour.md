Anna Heinrich is expecting her first child, a daughter, with husband Tim Robards in the coming months. 

And the 33-year-old was simply glowing as she enjoyed a day out boating with her 37-year-old husband on Thursday. 

The couple looked happy and relaxed as they brushed up on their skills before taking the boat out for a spin in Sydney Harbour.

Anna showed off her blossoming bump in a plain white T-shirt that she paired with a black sports bra and exercise leggings. 

She tied a black jumper around her hips and toted a white bag as she shaded her eyes from the sun with a pair of trendy sunglasses. 

The soon-to-be mum flaunted her natural beauty with minimal makeup, and she wore her blonde locks back in a ponytail.
