They announced their engagement in February this year. 

And Jess Wright seemed to be in great spirits as she stepped out with her fiancé William Lee-Kemp for a night on the town in Mayfair, London, on Saturday.

The reality star, 34, put on a stylish display in a sleek white wrap-front dress as she strolled hand-in-hand with her beau.

Jess boosted her height in a pair of gold heeled sandals, and her ensemble was cut high to accentuate her slender, sun-kissed legs.

She wore her raven tresses in loose waves that fell over her shoulders, and used a light palette of make-up for the occasion. 

Offsetting her look, Jess kept her personal items in a small black clutch bag, while she accessorised with a gold chain necklace.

Jess revealed plans for her upcoming nuptials last month as she prepares to marry the business owner.

She told Hello! how the pair have planned a ceremony in Majorca next June, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, and that there will be 15 bridesmaids - including her sister-in-law Michelle Keegan, actress wife of her brother Mark.

Mark himself will act as master of ceremonies.

'I've been dreaming of a fairytale wedding since I was little, when I used to dress up in my mum's net curtains,' she said.

'Now I can't wait for the moment I've been imagining for so long, walking up the aisle in a fabulous dress to marry Will.'

Of the location, she revealed: 'We've enjoyed some amazing holidays here and I practically grew up on the island because it's where my family has a second home.'

William proposed to Jess in ski resort Courchevel, France, in February.

'At breakfast one morning he told me he was feeling unwell and returned to our room. When I went to find him, the door was ajar and there was music playing.

'There were candles lining the hallway, red rose petals scattered across the floor, flowers, red heart-shaped balloons and two glasses of champagne waiting. I was stunned.

'Then Will called me out on to the balcony. With the snowy mountains behind him, he went down on one knee and asked me to marry him.' 

Jess has already delivered socially distanced formal invites to her 15 bridesmaids for their upcoming wedding. 

The TV star wrote on Instagram: '2020 has been a strange year for us all.

'I got engaged just before this pandemic, & when rules were eased, told my (many) nearest & dearest that I wanted them to be my bridesmaids, from a distance.

'I hope everyone is keeping safe & we get through this soon & a big thank you to all our NHS & key workers for supporting us.'
