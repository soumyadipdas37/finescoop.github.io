Justin Theroux has mostly been flying solo since his split from ex-wife Jennifer Aniston in 2017. 

But the Emmy winner has recently been in good company during quarantine, which he's spent with his dog Kuma.

And on Sunday he revealed that he's a Shakira stan while sporting a punky, black look while running errands with his pup in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City.

The 49-year-old paired the vintage-style tour t-shirt with some faded black skinny jeans and a pair of tan combat boots.

He finished the look with a black Irak baseball cap, gold-framed aviator sunglasses, a matching medallion necklace and a gold watch.

Theroux took precautions against COVID-19 in a black and white bandana-print face mask and some disposable black gloves. 

He walked the rescue pit bull on a braided black leash, while carrying a shopping bag from Best Buy.
