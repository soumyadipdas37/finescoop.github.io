She regularly shares sizzling snaps on social media for her fans.

Wow! Courtney Stodden channelled her inner Pamela Anderson as she set pulses racing in a plunging red swimsuit to mimic the iconic Baywatch look (R) in snaps shared on Thursday

Courtney, who recently dated Brian Austin Green following his split from Megan Fox, showed off a generous glimpse of her ample assets in the swimwear.

Her ensemble was cut high on the waist to accentuate her slender legs and her pert posterior as she posed for snaps by a roaring fire. 

The singer styled her brunette locks into loose waves that cascaded over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the photo shoot.

In her caption, Courtney wrote: 'Channelling my inner Pam.'

With the second snap she detailed her journey to embracing a body positive attitude as she admitted: 'For so long, as a teenager, I tried to make myself "the perfect woman" and was shamed for it.

'Now I’m a grown woman with a positive self image, who has embraced her sexuality - and I’m often shamed for that, too. So f*** what anyone says. Just do you.'

Last month, Courtney turned up the heat in a sizzling Instagram video, determined to grab attention for her latest single. 

The blonde put on an alluring display in a skimpy animal print bikini as she poured oil down her chest and writhed around to her new song Side Effects. 

Courtney previously said her new song is inspired by her brief fling with Brian Austin Green. 

'Side Effects is about that feeling you have when you leave an entanglement,' the Instagram model told Fox News of the track.

Courtney explained that the song is 'inspired by that recent entanglement' with the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, 47.

'You got a bad dose of a bad actor and just want to be sober again,' said the singer/model. 'The high isn't worth the side effects.'

Courtney, who's starred on The Mother Daughter Experiment and Celebrity Big Brother, said that the brief romance with Brian was 'the catalyst' behind the song, which she said was 'inspired' by her 'love life,' as well as 'the repercussions many of us women face when being used.'

Lyrics include: 'And now I'm so tired /Tired of it, I get so sick /Dealing with your Side /Side Effects, your side effects /You don't know how hard it gets /When I suffer from your side effects /And now I'm so tired, Tired of it /Your side effects.'

Courtney said she blocked Brian's number after 'several other women who he was playing came forward' to her at the time they were seeing one another.

'I stand with them and I believe them,' Courtney said, calling the veteran actor 'a womanizer' who wanted to keep their romance 'his little secret.'
