Rob started out as part of KUWTK but then drew back from the series as he battled weight gain and health issues.

He returned to the limelight with his own spin-off Rob & Chyna in 2016 which followed him and then-fiancee Blac Chyna in the run-up to the birth of their daughter Dream.

The couple split for good in early 2017 and Rob once again dropped out of the spotlight.

Famous family: Rob is the only son of Keeping Up With The Kardashians momager Kris Jenner. Last week, the family announced the E! reality show is ending after 14 years and 20 seasons 

Lately, though, Rob has started posting more on social media and his sister Khloe explained in July that he is feeling more confident these days. 

'We're filming more within our homes, and he is right there with us,' Khloe, 36, explained to People.

'I'm excited for everyone to see that. He's such a good person and I'm just happy he's coming back around on camera a little bit more.'

In August, Rob enjoyed a vacation in Turks & Caicos for his younger half-sister Kylie Jenner's 23rd birthday.  

He joined other family members including momager Kris Jenner and Khloe's baby daddy Tristan Thompson for the Caribbean getaway. 

In a photo he posted to Instagram, Rob looked healthy and happy as he laid across a foam pool floating mattress next to the 29-year-old Cleveland Cavaliers Power Forward/Center.

He captioned the image: 'Most Beautiful trip of my Life with the Fam‼️ HAPPY BIRTHDAY @kyliejenner‼️ Love You [two blue heart emojis]  WOO!!' 

Back in action: In July, his sister Khloe, 36, told People that Rob is feeling more confident these days and is happy to begin appearing in some scenes for their reality series
