The upcoming season of The Bachelorette is set to premiere soon on Channel 10. 

And now it's been claimed that hunky contestant Damien Stone is one of the top contenders on the show. 

A source told Daily Mail Australia this week that they believe Damien made it 'pretty close to the end' of the competition, because he's only just returned to social media after filming wrapped up.
