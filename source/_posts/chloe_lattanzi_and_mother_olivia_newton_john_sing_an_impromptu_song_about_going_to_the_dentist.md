Chloe Lattanzi joined her mother Olivia Newton John for a car ride on Monday, and the pair showed off their pipes. 

The 34-year-old launched into a song made up on the spot about her visit to the dentist, before her mum, 71, joined in. 

'On the way, to the dentist, where I will get drilled,' Chloe began, before turning to Olivia, who was driving.

'Soooo Happy (and safe!) mumma daughter hugs!' While Chloe and Olivia wore masks, they chose to avoid hugging face to face to help limit the potential spread of coronavirus

In an emotional video shared to Instagram, the mother-daughter duo ran towards each other as they gave each other a 'safe hug'.  

'Finally reunited and it feels so good,' Chloe captioned the video, which she had also edited with a pink heart filter.
