She is currently enduring a high-risk pregnancy as she anticipates the birth of her third child, a son, with husband of seven-years John Legend, 41. 

And Chrissy Teigen took to Instagram to share an ultrasound image of her 'sweet strong boy' with her 31.3million followers on Thursday.

'You are working so hard. I promise it'll be worth it!!!' captioned the 34-year-old model.

She also used social media to announce that, due to her risky pregnancy, she has had to postpone her upcoming Cravings cookbook 'indefinitely.'

'Today I had to postpone the cookbook indefinitely and send @AdeenaSussman alllll the way back to Tel Aviv,' began Teigen in a series of Twitter posts.

Sussman is a renown author and recipe developer who played an integral part in the production of Chrissy's first two cookbooks, Cravings and Cravings: Hungry for More. 

Cravings hit shelves in 2016 and proved to be smash hit among food lovers, which prompted the release of Cravings: Hungry for More in the fall 2018.

Chrissy added that, along with hitting pause of her cookbook, she has had to shut down filming on her popular Quibi series Chrissy’s Court.

'Baby cannot do it. I am devastated,' she concluded, referencing to her impending baby boy. 

A pregnancy defined as 'high-risk' requires more caution than a standard pregnancy due to the varying 'health conditions and circumstances' at play, according to Baby Center.

Those, like Teigen, who are dealing with a high-risk pregnancy are encouraged to get lots of rest and, if possible, significantly reduce their stress/workload.

Shortly after unveiling the postponement of her book and Quibi series, Chrissy returned to Twitter to thank her publishing team Clarkson Potter for their patience.

'I don't have to say this as they've already established they are sticking with me through all these tough times, but I would like to call out Clarkson Potter as the best publishing team ever.

'They've kindly dealt with every bout of depression, postpartum, book delays, everything.'

She noted that Clarkson Potter 'were always the first to tell [her] to take care of [her]self, when so many others would say "ok f**k you're out".

'I love them. love you @francis_lam so much,' Teigen concluded.

With her workload significantly reduced, Chrissy now has ample amounts of time to not only rest, but to help her hubby complete the interior design plans for their brand new home. 

It was revealed this week that the couple dropped $17.5million on a newly built mansion in the swanky Beverly Hills area. 

The couple put their prior property on the market for a whopping $23.95 million just last month. 

Legend and Teigen's new abode boasts 10,700 square-feet, which is over 2,000-square-feet larger than their previous Beverly Hills residence.
