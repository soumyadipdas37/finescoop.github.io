Sheridan, who welcomed her son in May, candidly discussed fears that her mental health issues could resurface during her pregnancy, and wanted the documentary to help other women.  

Cameras followed the star as she attended her first scans, pre-natal classes and sessions with a specialist therapist Dr Alain Gregoire, as well as at home with Jamie.

Speaking about her experience with motherhood, Sheridan admitted on This Morning that she 'was looking for things in the wrong places' before having a child, as she said he was the 'best thing' to ever happen to her.

Sheridan told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'I never saw myself having a child to be honest, until I met Jamie and now, oh my goodness, it’s the best thing in the world!' 

She added: 'It’s often hard and partly overlooked on the family and friends of people suffering with mental health, and Jamie had never experienced it before but was reading up on it and now knows me better than I know myself.

'He can see if I’m getting anxious, like this morning before doing this, and he just knows how to calm me down and talk me off the ledge a bit, just keeps me calm, so it’s just amazing that I’ve got such support in him.'
