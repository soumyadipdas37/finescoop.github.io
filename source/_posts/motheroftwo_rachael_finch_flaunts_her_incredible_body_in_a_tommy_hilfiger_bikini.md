She's been an ambassador for Myer department stores since 2015.

And it was just another day at the office for model Rachael Finch on Thursday as she took part in a beach photo shoot in Sydney.

The mother of two, 32, flaunted her toned physique in a Tommy Hilfiger bikini while shooting content for the retail giant's Spring-Summer campaign.

Documenting the shoot on Instagram Stories, she arrived in a white bathrobe with her entourage.

She then changed into a stylish two-piece, before later swapping it for a green pleated dress.

Elsewhere during the shoot, she modelled a leaf-print dress - and was even wearing the chic number when she stopped for lunch.
