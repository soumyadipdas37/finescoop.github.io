A young Texas doctor, 28, has died of a 'massive brain bleed' following a two month battle with COVID-19, after she became infected with the deadly virus while treating positive patients in a hospital emergency room. 

Adeline Fagan, an OB/GYN doctor originally from LaFayette, New York, died Saturday morning, hours after a nurse found her unresponsive and she was rushed for emergency surgery.

Fagan had taken a turn for the worse hours after 'doing wonderfully' in her fight against coronavirus in the days leading up to her death.  

Her devastated family announced the tragic news on a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for the doctor's medical expenses in her fight against the virus. 

Adeline Fagan (pictured), a 28-year-old Texas doctor, has died of a 'massive brain bleed' following a two month battle with COVID-19, after she became infected with the deadly virus while treating positive patients in a hospital emergency roo

Fagan was in her second year of residency at a hospital in Houston, when she became sick back in July. 

The doctor, who had a history of asthma, worked in the OB/GYN unit delivering babies but was working shifts in the ER treating COVID-19 patients as the state's hospitals buckled under the weight of soaring cases and deaths.

During a 12-hour shift on July 8, Fagan began feeling 'under the weather' with flu-like symptoms, according to the GoFundMe page.

She tested positive for COVID-91 and her condition deteriorated, leading to her being hospitalized.

Fagan spent several weeks in hospital, with doctors giving her several drugs and respiratory therapies to help her overcome the virus. 

She was intubated and placed on a ventilator on August 3 as her lungs could no longer support her, the GoFundMe post read. 

The following day doctors 'took the last remaining step available' and placed Fagan on ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, to oxygenate her blood because she was 'not responding well to the ventilator'.

Her sister Maureen wrote on the GoFundMe that the family expected her to be on the ventilator and ECMO for at least six to eight weeks while her lungs healed from the virus.  

Maureen described her sister as a 'fighter' who had 'set her mind to surviving this virus'.   

Brant, the doctor's dad, posted an update on the GoFundMe page Saturday announcing Fagan had died early that morning. 

He said his daughter had been 'doing wonderfully for the last few days' and the family got a 'good report' on her condition just minutes before she suddenly worsened. 

'As we settled down for the night 30 minutes later, the phone rang - Houston, TX,' he wrote. 





A nurse had found Fagan 'responsive' and she was rushed for a CT scan that showed she had suffered a 'massive brain bleed'.  

She needed emergency surgery and doctors warned her chances of survival were limited. 

'The neurosurgeon said it was a '1 in a million' chance she would even survive the procedure, but that Adeline would have several severe cognitive and sensory limitations if she did survive,' he wrote. 

'Of that the doctor was sure.'

A brain bleed can be a side effect of the ECMO, he explained. 

'Everyone was crushed by the events, the nurses, the doctors, and, of course, us. The doctor said they have seen this type of event in COVID patients that spend time on ECMO,' Brant wrote.



'The vascular system is also compromised by the virus, resulting in bleeds. We spent the remaining minutes hugging, comforting, and talking to Adeline. And then the world stopped.'  

Brant wrote of the family's heartache when their 'world stopped' and paid tribute to his daughter, urging others to 'be an 'Adeline' in the world'.

'The time the world stopped for a moment and will never be the same. Our beautiful daughter, sister, friend, physician, Adeline Marie Fagan, MD passed away,' he wrote.   

'If you can do one thing, be an 'Adeline' in the world. Be passionate about helping others less fortunate, have a smile on your face, a laugh in your heart, and a Disney tune on your lips,' he wrote. 

Fagan's death comes as cases have topped 729,284 and the death toll reached 14,843 in hard-hit Texas.   

Across America, the death toll is inching closer to 200,000 while cases have topped 6.8 million.
