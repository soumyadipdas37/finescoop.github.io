Shaughna Phillips shared glamorous snaps from her InTheStyle range, hours after revealing she has had a mystery surgery on her legs.

The Love Island star, 25, took to Instagram on Saturday to post pictures modelling for the brand, as she promoted her new clothing line that launches on Sunday.

However earlier in the day she posed for a selfie in a hospital bed, as she admitted she was in 'hospital swag' and was 'so high' after the procedure.

A second picture showed her legs covered in bandages from her thigh to her ankles, with her feet poking out at the bottom.

Referring to her feet, she joked: 'Hello swollen tootsies'. MailOnline has contacted Shaughna's representatives for comment.

By contrast, her post with InTheStyle saw her put on a stylish display in a plunging white tank top that she tucked into light-wash denim jeans.

Her golden locks were styled into glamorous waves, and she accentuated her pretty features with a light palette of make-up.

Mystery: It is currently unclear why Shaughna had to have the surgery, but she was seen stepping out in flip flops while still covered in bandages

Another snap saw Shaughna slip into a chic blue dress, while in another she paired a zebra-print top with distressed denim jeans.

Shaughna soared to fame earlier this year on the winter series of Love Island where she was left heartbroken after beau Callum Jones dumped her for Molly Smith in Casa Amor.

The feisty Londoner became an Internet sensation after she calmly said: 'Congrats, hun' after discovering the news.

In June, Shaughna hit back at a troll who accused her of undergoing secret surgery during lockdown in the comments section of her latest Instagram page.

The reality star, who was told she looked 'better before fillers' while on the show, questioned when she would have had injections during the coronavirus pandemic.

Shaughna had posted a stunning snap of herself on her social media feed, posing with a new Protein World product she was advertising.

 However underneath the image one critic penned: 'You looked better on love island ... u look twice your age now with all these fillers omgosh.'

'If you want to insult me, then it's strange anyway, but at least make it realistic! D**n son, do better! [sic]'. 

Setting the record straight, Shaughna responded saying: 'no angel I'm not denying anything, and never have. I openly speak about fillers I've had all the time, and I love them.

'What I'm denying is having anything done since leaving Love Island because of a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC.'
