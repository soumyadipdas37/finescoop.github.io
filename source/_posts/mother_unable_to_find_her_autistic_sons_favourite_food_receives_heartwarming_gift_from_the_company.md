A mother struggling to find her autistic son's favourite has been 'blown away' after the company dropped a free box of their products to her home. 

Leanne Page, 40, from Morayfield, north of Brisbane, went to her local Woolworths store earlier this month to discover they were out of Keith's Foods Mini Dagwood Dogs. 

When she was unable to find them in any nearby stores, she reached out to the Gold Coast-based company to ask if they had discontinued the range, which is the only thing her son Tyler, three, will eat.  

'I asked where I could buy them, I got put onto Karen who told me I could get them an hour-and-a-half away,' Ms Page told Daily Mail Australia. 

Leanne Page, 40, struggled to get her son Tyler (pictured), three to eat until she found Keith Foods' Mini Dagwood Dogs

'Next thing I know she has turned up at my door. Keith's Foods gave it to me for nothing. 

'It is the only thing my son eats. He hasn't eaten in the past two years.'

'I was blown away.'

Karen explained the shortage was due to Keith's Foods, which specialises in crumbed products, experiencing difficulties sourcing key ingredients amid the pandemic. 

Four days after making the hour-and-a-half drive to personally deliver the 30-pack box, Karen called Ms Page to tell her she would never have to worry about running out again. 

After reaching out to the company, Keith's Foods representative Karen (left) drove to Ms Page's (right)  Morayfield home to deliver a free 30-pack box 

Ms Page shared her experience in Facebook group The Kindness Pandemic with a photo of her gift to Karen and a card for the Keith's Foods team

'She spoke to her boss and they have decided that for however long my son eats these products they would supply us with 150 free when I contact them,'  Ms Page said. 

Karen returned days later with another delivery and was gifted with flowers and a card to say thank you to the team for 'going above and beyond'.

The mother-of-three said the kind act has had 'an amazing impact' on her family.

'I can't thank them enough, they have done so much for me.'

'Tyler was overwhelmed, he got more hot dogs so he was good!

'As long as he gets his mini hotdogs on his plate every night he is happy.'  

Ms Page shared her experience with the family owned business in Facebook group The Kindness Pandemic, which has since garnered more than 6000 positive reactions.

'Now that’s awesome customer service!' one person wrote.

Another comment read: ' This is amazing. Why can't more people be like this?'

The Australian operated business, founded in 1976, said they have also been bombarded with personal messages praising the heartwarming gesture. 

'It has been an amazing response and not something we expected,' a Keith's Foods spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

'We do stuff like this often, we work with a lot of charitable organisations through our distributors and donate directly to local church groups.' 

'We did not realise doing something like sending out Dagwood dogs to a mum and her boy would give us this sort of reaction.'  

'We are going to supply Ms Page constantly so her son will always be in constant supply.'
