Armed police swooped on a man in fancy dress spotted carrying a samurai sword which turned out to be a novelty umbrella.

Officers armed with Tasers dashed to the street in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, after receiving reports of a 'machete man' prowling the town centre.

But they were stunned when the man turned out to be wearing a fancy dress costume with an umbrella which had a 'sword hilt' handle.

Warwickshire Police tweeted a snap, above, of the man wearing Cosplay and a mask posing by a patrol car after the bizarre incident on a street in Leamington Spa on Tuesday

He was wearing a kilt and sinister laughing clown face mask as part of a Cosplay outfit - short for costume play.

Cosplay fans dress up as a character often from popular anime or computer games. 

Warwickshire Police tweeted a snap of the man posing by a patrol car after the bizarre incident on Tuesday, and said: 'Not everything is always as it seems.

'Patrol officers from Leamington Spa deployed with Taser to reports of a man walking down Warwick Street holding a samurai sword.

'Upon engagement, the 'sword' was found to be an umbrella with a sword-hilt handle.

'Not everything is always as it seems. Cosplay safe!'
