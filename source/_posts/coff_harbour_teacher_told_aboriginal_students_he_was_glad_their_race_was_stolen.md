A casual teacher has sparked outrage after he allegedly told a group of Indigenous high school students he was 'glad their race was stolen'.

The casual teacher at Orara High School in Coffs Harbour, on the New South Wales mid north coast, allegedly made the comments on Wednesday - sparking a protest by students on Friday.

Hayley Piper was close to being inconsolable when the teacher allegedly aimed the words at a group of students she was part of.

Her aunt and guardian, Angel Piper, told Daily Mail Australia that after speaking with an Indigenous leader and the deputy principal at the school Hayley called her.  

'She called me quite upset and it took me a little to calm her down as I couldn't understand what she was saying properly,' Ms Piper said.

She said that is when Hayley alleges the teacher said he was 'glad their race was stolen'.

The deputy principal and the Indigenous leader urged Ms Piper to come into the school for a meeting immediately. 

'When I was talking to both the deputy principal and Uncle Matt they both expressed how angry and hurt they were the situation,' Ms Piper said.

'The deputy principal said that he - along with others - will be doing everything they can do to get to the bottom of it ASAP.'

Ms Piper said she was proud of her niece.

'I am very proud of Hayley for standing up not just what she believes in but standing up for her fellow Aboriginals whom also get racial remarks,' she said.

The high school's principal Malcolm McFarlene said he was proud of the students for protesting.

He told the ABC a serious conversation was being held with the staff member, who had offered an apology to students.

'There was a link [made] between students' behaviour and cultural background, which is something that we won't tolerate in our school,' Mr McFarlene said. 

The exact wording of the remarks is still being investigated.

Mr McFarlene said staff met with 100 students on Thursday to discuss the allegations, and that will staff will be trained accordingly.

NSW Department of Education said they were aware of the allegations.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Department of Education and Orara High School for comment.
