The soap has made its long-awaited return to screens after a three-month break.

And it seems that EastEnders' Habiba Ahmed is still struggling to accept her relationship with Jags Panesar, as she forces him to hide under a table during Tuesday's show.

After sharing a secret kiss the couple have been keeping their romance a secret, and in upcoming scenes he squeezes into a cabinet to avoid being spotted by her family.

Habiba (Rukku Priya Nahar) and Jags' relationship has clearly heated up during lockdown, and the pair come dangerously close to being caught in a cosy embrace.

As Habiba hears her family coming, she forces Jags (played by Amar Adatia) to hide in the bottom of a table, leaving him mortified.

Sadly it seems that Habiba still isn't ready to go public with her new romance, as leaves him devastated by making more excuses.

Habiba and Jags shared a surprise kiss when he opened up about his mum Suki's lies, as he admitted it made him see his mum in a completely different light.

It remains to be seen whether the pair can finally overcome their doubts and share news of their relationship with loved ones.

This week has seen EastEnders make its long-awaited return to screens, after being forced to take a three-month break due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The show will pick up many weeks later and will show how the residents of Albert Square coped with being holed up in lockdown.

Executive producer Jon Sen revealed bosses had to 'cheat' the social distancing rules with protective screens and have even drafted in the help of stars' real-life partners as body doubles for intimate scenes.

Speaking to MailOnline at the soap's virtual launch, Jon explained that like many other soaps they've used clever camera methods to hide the two metre distance between cast members.  

But he also revealed that they've used perspex screens between stars to continue filming passionate kiss scenes, and have even used some of the cast's real-life partners as body doubles.

He said: 'When we came back we had to devise methods where we could cheat the distance, it's very odd shooting like this, never before in TV history have we made drama in this way, certainly we were forced to work with this 2 metre rule.'

EastEnders continues on Tuesday, September 8 at 7:30pm on BBC One.
