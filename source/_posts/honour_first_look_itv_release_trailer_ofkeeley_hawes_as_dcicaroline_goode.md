ITV has released a first look trailer of Keeley Hawes as real-life Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode in new drama Honour.

The actress, 44, is taking on the role of the DCI, who brought five killers to justice in the tragic true story of Banaz Mahmod - the young Londoner, 20, murdered by her own family for falling in love with the wrong man.

Rising star Buket Komur plays Banaz in the series while Moe Bar-El plays her boyfriend Rahmat Sulemani, who had reported her missing at the time.

FIRST LOOK: ITV has released a first look trailer of Keeley Hawes as real-life Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode in new drama Honour

In the first look trailer, it sees Rahmat talking in court as he says: 'They chose for her another husband but Banaz chose me. We cannot choose who to love!'

The next clip goes to Keeley as DCI Caroline as she briefs her team about Banaz's disappearance.

She says: 'Banaz Mahmod aged 20. Born in Iraqi, Kurdistan, came to this country as a child of 10.'

It then sees DCI Caroline's team gathering evidence at various different locations while she goes on to brief her team in a separate meeting: 'Banaz had five different contacts with the police before she disappeared.'

The Detective Chief Inspector is later warned by her manager: 'This is very careful handling, Caroline.'

The first look trailer also sees Banaz's loved ones share their anger over her disappearance as one person says: 'Five times the police have failed her.' 

At the end of the chilling teaser, DCI Caroline warns: 'I care very much about Banaz and I will not rest until I bring her killers to justice.'   

Other actors involved in the series include Waj Ali, Ahd, Rhianne Barreto, Michael Jibson and Robby Haynes.

Briefing: The next clip goes to Keeley as DCI Caroline as she briefs her team about Banaz's disappearance

Honour is set to air later this September and will play out in two hour-long episodes. 

It is written by Vanity Fair's Gwyneth Hughes and directed by Mrs Wilson's Richard Laxton. Keeley has also served as an executive producer. 

Talking about the ITV drama based on real-life events, Keeley said: 'It is a privilege to be working on Honour as Buddy Club's first ever project. 

'In a time where honour killings are still rife, it is critical to shine a light on such an important subject. Banaz Mahmod's story, and DCI Goode's subsequent investigation, is certainly one that needs to be told and I am proud to be a part of it.'

Evidence: It then sees DCI Caroline's team gathering evidence at various different locations while she goes on to brief her team in a separate meeting: 'Banaz had five different contacts with the police before she disappeared.'

Justice: At the end of the chilling teaser, DCI Caroline warns: 'I care very much about Banaz and I will not rest until I bring her killers to justice.'

It comes after Keeley discussed her experience of playing the real-life police officer who solved Britain's most notorious honour killing.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode led an inquiry into the murder of Banaz, 20, at the hands of her family after she was found in a Birmingham garden in 2006.

The actress admitted she was more 'mindful' in character than any other project she's worked on to give the victim 'the utmost respect'.

According to The Sun, she said in a new interview: 'The responsibility is huge. I felt it every day, and every day since. You want to do the right thing by everyone involved.

Roles: Rising star Buket Komur plays Banaz in the series while Moe Bar-El plays her boyfriend Rahmat Sulemani (pictured with Keeley), who had reported her missing at the time 

'It is about these two women. You want to give Banaz the utmost respect and also do the right thing by Caroline. One of my reasons for doing the drama was shining a light on so-called honour killings. I hate to use the word honour. It's murder, it's rape, it's abuse. 

'We were so mindful we were dealing with real people, so there is that element – much more so than anything I've worked on. It was an un-turndownable role.'

While filming the drama, the Bodyguard star, who shares three children with husband of 16 years and fellow actor Matthew Macfadyen, 'got through' days on set by meeting up with the 'extraordinary' retired detective.   

Banaz 'dishonoured' her father after leaving an abusive marriage and falling in love with Rahmat, another man from a different Kurdish clan.    

Banaz was garroted with a bootlace, before her body was stuffed in a suitcase and buried under a freezer.

Disgrace: (L to R) Mohammed Ali, Omar Hussain and Mahmod, were all found guilty for the murder of Banaz, 20, in 2006 after she fell in love with a man disapproved of by her family

Mr Sulemani never recovered from the death of his beloved girlfriend and committed suicide in 2016, after reportedly telling police there was 'no life' for him.

Her father and brother were jailed for life in 2007, after being found guilty for their part.

Three years later, Omar Hussain and Mohamad Saleh Ali, who carried out the killing, were extradited from Iraq and given life sentences while a third man, Mohamad Hama, admitted murder.

Goode was a senior detective in the Metropolitan Police's Homicide Command when she covered the case. 

Banaz's murder was one of far too many so-called 'honour killings' in Britain. More than 5,000 such deaths are estimated to occur around the world every year.

Some take place behind closed doors in the UK — and some girls are taken abroad to be killed. 

Honour airs later in September on ITV.  

Speaking out: It comes after Keeley discussed her experience of playing the real-life police officer who solved Britain's most notorious honour killing (pictured in March)
