This is the adorable moment a crying baby interrupted an Education Select Committee's video call as the newborn's father battled to keep his little girl quiet. 

Stoke Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis, 30, who used to be a secondary school teacher in Birmingham, appeared on the Zoom group along with his newborn Amelia.

At first, the little one appeared to be settled in her dad's arms, but soon started to cry, forcing the father to leave the room and come back wearing a baby carrier.

Footage of the surprising scenes was shared to Twitter this morning, with social media users praising the MP for his multitasking skills during the Ofqual grilling over the exam results fiasco.

At the start of the clip, Mr Gullis can be seen expertly cradling his baby while responding to his colleagues.

And even when his newborn starts to interrupt the meeting, Mr Gullis continues to try and professionally question and listen to the information he's receiving.

Eventually, the MP leaves the room and returns with a baby carrier and it appears to be just the trick to get his newborn to settle down again. 

Social media users were quick to praise the parent for their work, with one person writing: 'Lovely to see a male MP on the education select committee dial in with his wee baby attached to him. I recognise that constant swaying!'

Another said: 'Is this the youngest ever member of the Education Select Committee? Tory MP Jonathan Gullis cradles baby in papoose during remote grilling of @Ofqual. Loving the multitasking vibe.'

On August 18, Mr Gullis shared a snap of himself and his newborn daughter to his personal Instagram account to announce her birth. 

'On Sunday Nkita gave birth to our beautiful baby girl, Amelia. She weighed in at 7lbs 13ozs and both Nkita and Amelia are in good health,' he wrote.

'I am the proudest man alive and can’t wait to just spend some time with my family.'

The meeting today discussed the government's forced U-turn and allow A-level and GCSE results in England to be based on teachers' assessments after a furious row over grades. 

Regulator Ofqual confirmed last month that England would follow steps already taken by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after a controversial computer algorithm marked down thousands of teenagers.

It announced that students would be able to take the higher of either the adjusted grade or the estimate made by their teachers. 

A-level and GCSE exams were cancelled this year because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
