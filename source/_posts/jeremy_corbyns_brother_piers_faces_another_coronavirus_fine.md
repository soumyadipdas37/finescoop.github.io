The older brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been charged with three offences under the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020

It is alleged that Mr Corbyn arranged and facilitated, then participated in, a gathering of more than 30 people on Saturday, September 5. He is also accused of failing to wear a face covering in a required area.

Corbyn has been bailed to appear at Sheffield Magistrates' Court in November. 

A 44-year-old man from the Reading area who was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder at the gathering has been released on bail.

Saturday's protest led to significant disruption for shoppers and members of the public in the city centre, and four of our officers were assaulted and left with minor injuries.

He was joined by anti-5G campaigner Mark Steele in the Sheffield Peace Gardens, with South Yorkshire Police in attendance.

In Sheffield, protestors at the rally held signs saying 'stop new normal' and 'freedom over fear'.

Others at the rally held signs saying 'don't let them muzzle you' as Piers Corbyn addressed the crowd.

Last Saturday, the meteorologist led more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally in Trafalgar Square.

He was seen being hauled off by officers after the event and his Twitter account has since confirmed he was slapped with the colossal fine and 'held for ten hours.' 

He was among eight other offenders who were fined across the rest of England under new lockdown measures imposed last week which are designed to stop gatherings of more than 30 people.

The hefty fine is now being wielded by police forces across the country to discourage people from meeting in groups of more than 30.

The arrest of Mr Corbyn in Trafalgar Square was the third time the divisive anti-lockdown campaigner has been arrested since the pandemic started. He was carted out of Hyde Park by officers on May 16 and May 30. 

Mr Corbyn, the older brother of the former Labour leader, was seen being hauled off by officers after the event and his Twitter account has since confirmed he was slapped with the colossal fine and 'held for ten hours.'

He was among eight other offenders who were fined across the rest of England under new lockdown measures imposed on Friday which are designed to stop gatherings of more than 30 people.

Protesters held signs with the words 'plandemic' and 'scamdemic'. They also read: 'Save our children' and 'no forced vaccines'

The others that were fined had all been organising raves or house parties. 

The hefty fine is now being wielded by police forces across the country to discourage people from meeting in groups of more than 30. 

On Saturday and into the early hours of Sunday, four people were fined £10,000 each for spearheading a rave in Headingly and another was fined the same for a house party in Leeds.

Two DJs were also fined £10,000 each and had their equipment seized by officers in Burley, West Yorkshire Police said.

The arrest of Mr Corbyn in Trafalgar Square was the third time the divisive anti-lockdown campaigner has been arrested since the pandemic started. He was carted out of Hyde Park by officers on May 16 and May 30.   

Other signs read 'smiles not masks' and 'the great reset = digital slavery.' Thousands of protesters flocked to Trafalgar Square on Saturday

Signs reading 'Covid cure: Strict 90-day TV-free diet' and 'we can choose' were clutched by demonstrators as they marched in London 

A massive crowd of people took to the streets of London during the protest on August 29. They clutched various signs as they marched to Westminster

The Unite for Freedom rally started at noon in the capital and they demonstrators marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament. 

Pictures from the demonstration showed Trafalgar Square packed with protesters - none of whom wore masks - holding signs that branded the pandemic as a 'hoax'.  

Other signs claimed masks reduce immunity and likened the restrictions to 'child torture'. One person held a homemade placard on which he had scrawled 'no to mandatory vaccines.' 

David Icke attended yesterday's protest and urged police to 'stop serving the psychopaths' and join those protesting in a speech addressing the cheering crowd.

Video from the scene showed organisers label the Government 'terrorists who are waging a war on the people of this country'. 

One man says: 'This is a political agenda to commit mass genocide on the population. That is their agenda.' 

A poster advertising the event read: 'Nothing is more important as time is very short - the Government are voting for a two-year extension of their emergency Covid-19 powers in September 2020.

'The first six months was a disaster - this must not be allowed to continue! We have to take a stand.'

Huge crowd of anti-vaxxers  joined Jeremy Corbyn's brother and David Icke in Trafalgar Square before marching on the Houses of Parliament

It lists its priorities as 'no more lockdowns, no social distancing, no masks. No track and trace, no health passports. No mandatory vaccinations, no 'new normal'. Restore all human rights that have been violated.'

The poster lists 'top world class doctors and nurses speaking out with real truth on Covid-19 against GMC constraints'. 

Mr Corbyn was arrested on May 16 after he used a megaphone to say 'vaccination is not necessary' and '5G towers will be installed everywhere', adding: '5G enhances anyone who's got illness from Covid, so they work together.' 

There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines.

He was then arrested again on May 30 at a protest in which he also spoke through a megaphone.
