Rumer Willis did not shy away from heaping on the PDA while out and about with Armie Hammer earlier this month.

But on Thursday the daughter of screen legends Bruce Willis and Demi Moore opted to go about her day solo while out taking care of some personal business in West Hollywood.

And like most days the actress was all about showcasing her fit figure in black skin-tight shorts and a tan sleeveless crop top.

The actress appeared to ooze confidence when she stepped out of her SUV just as she was securing a black protective mask on her face amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

She also donned white socks, white sneakers and carried a small black purse over her left shoulder.

In the early part of her day, Willis wore her wavy raven tresses long and flowing well past the middle of her back.

For her first stop, Willis dropped her pet pooch to Healthy Spot, which is doggie daycare and groomer.

From there, the Once Upon a Time In Hollywood actress went to pick up a snack and a smoothie at Kreation Organic Juicery in West Hollywood.

Eventually her day took her to Hair By Violet in Beverly Hills, where she spent about four hours with the celebrity stylist.

By late afternoon, close to the early evening hours, Willis took to Instagram and shared a photo of herself decked out in her sporty ensemble. 

'Anyone else feeling super weird today?' she headlined the snap that was taken in front of lush green trees.    

Willis, who won the 20th season of Dancing With The Stars in 2015, is the oldest of five sisters that includes Scout, 29, and Tallulah, 26.

They also has two half-sisters Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, six, from father Bruce Willis' current marriage to Emma Heming.
