During this year's event, the first taking place after the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, numerous boats rowed on the Grand Canal to re-enact the glorious past of the Venice Republic. 

Venice was once one of Italy’s major maritime republics and its power and splendour are celebrated each September.

Amongst a thousand colours and costumed extras, the doge, elected lord and chief of state of Venice, the doge's wife and the highest magistrate officers of the ancient Venice Republic are brought back to life to show the splendour and wealth of Venice's glorious era.
