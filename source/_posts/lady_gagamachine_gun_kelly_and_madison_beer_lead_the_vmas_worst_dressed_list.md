The annual VMAs are famed for bringing out the edgiest looks from the A-list. 

And Sunday night's show was no different as a legion of stars opted for extremely funky ensembles, complete with futuristic styles, a bold pink look and barely-there bodycon for the pre-recorded show. 

Landing themselves on the list of the show's kookiest, quirkiest and most bizarre looks were stars including Lady Gaga, Machine Gun Kelly and Madison Beer during the evening of the greats. 

Wow: Lady Gaga, Machine Gun Kelly and Madison Beer led the kooky ensembles at Sunday's VMAs

Marking a bizarre return to the red carpet amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the event was filmed over days at several different locations with production abiding by social distancing guidelines as it aired 'live'. 

The event was initially tipped to be hosted from Brooklyn's Barclays Center however a change in plans saw the show shifted to pre-records, despite MTV claiming much of the show would remain live. 

Amid her nine outfit changes, Lady Gaga typically brought the dramatic goods in a series of ensembles which showcased her trademark kooky style to perfection. 

Her most jaw-dropping style came in her volumunious silver look, which featured a puffball shirt dress. Doing her bit for the cause, all her looks of the evening included coordinated masks. 

Evolution: Gaga had nine different outfit changes during the two-hour event including her red carpet look, with a futuristic ensemble, a bird-of-paradise type look and a billowing green gown

Tricon: Lady Gaga used the opportunity to promote the use of face masks

With her silver look however, she borrowed from the skies as she donned an astronaut worthy glass bowl on her head, which she noted was her being ahead of the trend with face coverings. 

Another of her quirky looks saw the iconic songstress don a bird of paradise-inspired style, with a host of multi-coloured feathers drowning her incredible figure.  

Making sure he was a stand out star of the red carpet, Machine Gun Kelly went showstopping in his style.

Borrowing from Ken Doll for inspiration, the rapper donned a bright pink tank top with coordinating suit trousers and jacket while going for a Sid Vicious-style hair do. 

He later upped the ante further as he donned a bold purple-blue boiler suit.

Oh my! He later upped the ante further as he donned a bold purple-blue boiler suit

While Madison certainly looked phenomenal, she seemed to have borrowed from the hosiery department with her eye-popping mini dress which left very little to the imagination. 

A notable mention had to go to Miley Cyrus, who was returning to her raucous days in as sizzling sheer ensemble which showcased her sensational figure and edgy style.  

Earlier this month, it was announced that the VMAs would not take place at Barclays as initially planned, instead taking the festivities outdoors as a precaution against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Miley Cyrus looked sensational as she arrived at the 2020 MTV VMAs wearing a sheer black Mugler frock layered over lingerie. The 27-year-old is the queen of daring red carpet looks, but this might be one of our all-time favourites! 

We love the mirrored embellishments and the matching gloves, which makes for a sexy yet stylish look. It hails from the Autumn/Winter '20 collection, and when teamed with a pair of Gucci heels and jewellery by Loree Rodkin, we're definitely going to remember this one!

Green lady: Nicole Richie was also keeping things kooky

The decision was reached mutually between both MTV and representatives from the large Barclays venue, who said in a statement:

'The 2020 VMAs paid homage to the incredible resiliency of New York with several outdoor performances around [the city] with limited or no audience, adhering to all state and city guidelines.

'In close consultation with state and local health officials‎, it became clear at this time that outdoor performances with limited or no audience would be more feasible and safer than an indoor event,' the statement continued.

'The VMAs will highlight the boroughs in an exciting show and return to Barclays Center in 2021. MTV will continue to work closely with the Department of Health, state and local officials, the medical community, and key stakeholders to ensure the safety of all involved,' the missive concluded.
