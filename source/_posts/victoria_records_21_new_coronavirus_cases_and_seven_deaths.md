Victoria has recorded 21 new cases of COVID-19 in the lowest daily increase since June, and a further seven deaths. 

Metropolitan Melbourne's 14-day average has plummeted and now sits at 39.3 as the state moves to a COVID normal. 

In regional Victoria, the 14-day average is at just 1.9.

The daily update comes as disgruntled Melburnians revealed they are planning to take to the streets again in protest of the city's Stage Four lockdown restrictions.  

Over the last two weekends protesters have clashed with police at the Shrine Of Remembrance, The Tan track and Queen Victoria Market.

Police arrested 74 people and issued at least 176 infringement notices during last Sunday's protest at the market. 

It will be the third weekend protesters have gathered at inner-city landmarks to rally against the state government's Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne. 

Residents in regional Victoria are now enjoying eased coronavirus restrictions after they moved away from Stage Three lockdown at 11.59pm on Wednesday.    

Pubs, cafes and restaurants are able to serve people outside with strict density quotas, while outdoor gathering limits will be upped to 10.

Regional Victorians are also able to leave their homes without restriction and all shops can reopen.

They will still be able to travel via Melbourne to reach other parts of the state, but can only stop for three reasons including food, care and permitted work and study.

Caravan parks and camping grounds in regional areas were also allowed to reopen from Thursday, but with group booking restrictions.

Melbourne residents who leave the city without a lawful excuse will be fined $4,957.

The new offence is designed to deter Melburnians from entering regional Victoria.

It will be bolstered by beefed-up roadblocks, creating lengthy traffic delays as vehicles pass through.

Melbourne's new case average must stay between 30 to 50 for some of the city's restrictions to be eased as planned on September 28.

 

More to come.
