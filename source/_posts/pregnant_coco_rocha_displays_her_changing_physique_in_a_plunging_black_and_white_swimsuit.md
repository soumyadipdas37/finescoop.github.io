Hitting back at the comment, Coco remarked: 'I've seen (and subsequently blocked and deleted) a few comments on here from some accusing me of 'hiding' my pregnancy bump and asking me to instead be 'proud of it' and telling me that I need to 'show it' more.'



Shocked: Coco was left raging after followers accused her of 'hiding' her shape beneath a sweet picture of herself cuddling her children and husband 

She continued: 'First of all, I literally announced I was pregnant 5 weeks ago via @people magazine, so if I was trying to hide it, I did a terrible job of that. 

'Second, never tell a woman what part of her body you think you have a right to see on her social media. 

'Third, please try to love yourself and your own life instead of wasting your days criticizing someone else. 

'I'm 100% loving my life, my family, my pregnancy, my body, my bump and especially my day by the pool! #stylethebump'.

Coco revealed that they discovered she was pregnant with their third child just before the nationwide coronavirus lockdown was announced. 

Although Coca admitted she has been feeling 'really good' throughout the pregnancy and is glad to have her family around, she revealed she was missing James attend appointments and scans with her.

She said: 'The only hardship is that you can't bring daddy in. We get to FaceTime and I know I've seen some other celebrities kind of showing how that's worked for them,' she says. It is a very different scenario, but I do appreciate everyone taking it so seriously. And the doctors have been awesome.'
