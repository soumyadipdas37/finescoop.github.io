She was the first hopeful sent home on Locky Gilbert's season of The Bachelor.

And since her exit from the show, Nadine Kodsi seems to have transformed her appearance.

In a recent selfie, the 30-year-old sports an oversized pout that looks nothing like her regular sized lips from The Bachelor.

While some may assume that her pout is the result of fillers, Nadine insists that her plump appearance is down to makeup and filters. 

'It's not surgery, they're my lips,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's makeup and filters, but the bigger the better!'

Since leaving The Bachelor mansion, the glamorous Nadine has earned attention for looking like Married At First Sight's Martha Kalifatidis.

'It's not surgery, they're my lips,' Nadine told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's makeup and filters, but the bigger the better!'

The pair have similar features and a passion for fashion, and even share near identical usernames on Instagram.

Lebanese stunner Nadine goes by @nadinee__k on the social media site, while Greek beauty Martha is known as @marthaa__k to her 340,000 followers. 

Nadine recently revealed that she has no plans to appear on Bachelor in Paradise - or any other reality show for that matter.

'I have a life outside of The Bachelor,' the 30-year-old told Daily Mail Australia last month when asked if she would consider returning to the franchise. 

The brunette beauty, who has a degree in criminology, has since returned to her day job as a fashion entrepreneur.

Nadine has been an outspoken critic of Locky Gilbert and the entire Bachelor franchise since her exit.

Last month, she called Locky a 'production puppet' after he was seen with the earpiece on the So Dramatic podcast.
