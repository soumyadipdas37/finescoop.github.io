Tottenham have released a hilarious video of new signing Matt Doherty deleting his old tweets in which he revealed he was a 'huge' Arsenal fan.

The defender had some explaining to do after supporters uncovered the previous posts from 2012 ahead of his ¬£15million move from Wolves, which was completed on Sunday.

In the comical video, Doherty is sat in his new Spurs shirt and opens up a laptop with the old tweets showing on the screen.

Tottenham released a video of new signing Matt Doherty deleting old tweets about Arsenal

The defender posted that he was a huge fan of Spurs' north London rivals on Twitter in 2012

The right back looked guilty as he hovered over the first post which read: 'I love Arsenal forever and ever.'

After deleting the first tweet, Doherty looked sheepishly at the camera before finding the next post in which he said: 'Yes I'm a HUGE Arsenal fan.'

That was also removed before the 28-year-old nodded his head in approval and tapped the Spurs badge to signal his loyalty to his new club.

The previous tweets from the 28-year-old had been discovered by fans ahead of his transfer

The full-back has signed a deal with the north London side until 2024 after a 10-year spell with Wolves.

Speaking after his transfer, Doherty said: 'I am very proud to be joining such a big club. It has the best stadium and possibly the best training ground in the world from what I have seen.

'When you start something new you want to start well and get off to a fast start. I can't wait to get going.

'I wanted to travel down to play in the game [against Birmingham] and that's how excited I feel coming here.'
