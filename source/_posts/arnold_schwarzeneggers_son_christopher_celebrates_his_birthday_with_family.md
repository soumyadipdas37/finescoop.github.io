He is the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.

And Christopher Schwarzenegger was surrounded by his doting family as he celebrated his 23rd birthday at home on Monday evening.

The couple's youngest son, 23, sat holding a huge iced cake in his hands which featured the words: 'Happy birthday Christopher! Love your family'.

Christopher sported a beaming smile as he sat beside his famous father Arnie, while his mother Maria, 64, and siblings Patrick, 27, and Christina, 29, stood behind.

The sweet family snap was taken in a back garden as they threw a small celebration for their son and posted on Instagram by Patrick with a series of cake emojis. 

Although she was absent from the snap, his sister Katherine commented underneath: 'I LOVE THEM ALL SO MUCH IT HURTS.'

Meanwhile, Arnold commemorated the day by sharing a montage of snaps of his son and a touching message about how proud he is of his child.

He wrote: 'Happy birthday Christopher! You are such a fantastic son - kind, smart, giving, and everything I could ask for. I can't wait to see what you do with this year, but I know I'll be proud watching! I love you!'

Christopher celebrated his graduation from the University of Michigan back in May.

At the time, Arnold shared a photo of Christopher to his Instagram to congratulate him on graduating with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan.

Alongside a photo of Christopher in cap and gown mocked up to show him holding his degree and an 'I did it' trophy, the Hollywood star, 72, wrote: 'Christopher, you are a champion and I love you.'

Arnie continued: 'I know your graduation from Michigan wasn’t the big celebration you dreamed about for years, but walking across a stage isn’t what makes me so proud of you: it’s your compassion, your hard work, your vision, your critical thinking, and your selflessness that make me burst with pride.'

'I can’t wait to watch you keep climbing and succeeding,' the proud father added.

It's not known what Christopher's degree is in.

Last September, his older sister Katherine, 30, traveled to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to spend Christopher's 22nd birthday with him and posted photos of the celebrations on her Instagram. 

He also has a half-brother Joseph Baena who was born five days after him in 1997.

Joseph is Arnold's son with the family's former housekeeper Mildrid Baena, 59.

The illicit relationship and secret son was revealed in a bombshell article by the LA Times just four months after the end of Arnold's term as Governor of California.

As a result of the scandal, Maria moved out of the family home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and the couple confirmed their 25-year marriage was over.
