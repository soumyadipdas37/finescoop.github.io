Kaia finished her look with a white T-shirt, comfy-looking brown suede desert boots, 90s-style sunglasses and a brown handbag. 

The star left her pink dyed locks in a loose tousled hairdo and appeared to go makeup-free.

Kaia took cautious measures amid the coronavirus pandemic as she was spotted wearing a black face mask.

The model appeared in good spirits as she carried a coffee and a book, no doubt one of the novels she is currently reading for her Book Club.

Elsewhere, Kaia and Euphoria star Jacob have been inseparable after going public with their romance earlier this week.

The new couple have been enjoying several dates in NYC and have been spotted putting on numerous cosy displays.

Jacob has been linked to his former Euphoria co-star Zendaya and Joey King, whom he starred with in The Kissing Booth. 

Jacob and Zendaya first landed at the centre of dating rumours after they were spotted on a getaway to Greece back in August 2019.

Sizzling: The model also shared a snap to her Instagram where she displayed her washboard abs in a crop top and mini skirt while wearing a face mask 

While the two never announced their relationship, a source confirmed the actors were indeed dating in an Us Weekly report in February 2020. 

Jacob's recent outings with Kaia have sparked speculation his relationship with Zendaya has ended.  

Kaia was previously in a relationship with SNL star Pete Davidson and in July was seen putting on a very affectionate display with Cara Delevingne at a Black Lives Matter rally in LA.   

Not only that, but the two models also got matching 'solemate' tattoos on their feet in August.
