He started his new role as co-host of Studio 10 alongside Sarah Harris, last Monday.

But on Wednesday, Tristan MacManus admitted his role has been 'a bit difficult to get used to' because he'd been working as a landscaper before landing the TV gig. 

Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O show, the Irish dancer, 38, said: 'It's been a bit difficult to get used to. It's not like I have a point to reference.'

'I'd been breaking my a** for the last couple months landscaping when my work got cancelled,' he added.

'I was labouring and now I have a suit on and I'm getting paid well,' he said.

Tristan was a judge on Channel 10's Dancing with the Stars but filming for the show ended in March and he started working as a labourer.

The Irish co-host made his debut on Studio 10 last Monday, less than one week after former co-host Joe Hildebrand revealed that he'll be leaving the show.

Joe's position on the morning talk show had been up in the air ever since Channel 10 announced its latest round of redundancies last month.

But many viewers have criticised the revamped version and are now calling for Joe, 44, to return to breakfast program alongside Sarah.

'I think this is the death of Studio 10. I don't find that MacManus bloke very appealing it's actually very boring,' one person tweeted.

'I'm not watching Studio 10 without Joe,' another commented. 'Joe we need you back on Studio 10 pronto,' another person agreed.

'Today's #Studio10 was like trying on a new pair of shoes for the first time. It will take a bit of wearing in before I decide if I like them or not,' one person said.

Ten also reportedly made the decision to disable comments on the show's Instagram account after viewers criticised the new format.

According to TV Blackbox, hundreds of negative comments have been deleted from the show's Instagram and Facebook pages.
