Bachelor in Paradise Star Jamie Doran has publicly defended Kaitlyn Hoppe after her relationship with Bernard Tomic was exposed. 

In a comment made on the So Dramatic Podcast Instagram account on Monday, Jamie, 40, wrote of The Bachelor starlet:  'Probably the biggest heart of gold you'll ever meet in your life. 

'She'll be okay. She's got a lot of good people around her who will support her through the many peaks and troughs of reality TV' he added.

It comes after troubled Australian tennis star Bernard and The Bachelor contestant had a very public row inside strip club last weekend.

Tomic, 27, and Hoppe, 26, were seen arguing inside Hollywood Showgirls strip club during a big night out on the Gold Coast on Saturday, September 5.

The argument led to Ms Hoppe leaving the club, while Tomic - a regular patron - was allowed to stay.

It is understood the pair have been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, which recommenced after Ms Hoppe was kicked off The Bachelor.

Ms Hoppe refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. 

A source told Daily Mail Australia the altercation brought the club to a standstill.

'They got in a big fight at Hollywood Showgirls the other weekend... everyone heard and saw it,' the man said.

'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other.'

Having long been dubbed the brightest future star in world tennis, Tomic's career is almost at a point of no return.

Tomic, the former world number 17, has not played a professional match since March and has not won a Grand Slam match since mid-2018

The world number 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.

The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.

But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, Tomic's career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.

Ms Hoppe is the daughter of former NRL star Sean, who was the league's leading try scorer in 1995.

A former real estate agent and model, she entered The Bachelor as an intruder and was quick to cause controversy.

Last month, a heated argument between Ms Hoppe and fellow Bachelor star Roxi Kenny stunned viewers of the Channel 10 show.

A jealous Roxi, 29, became furious after discovering her love rival had given leading man Locky Gilbert a kiss at the cocktail party.

At one stage, she said within earshot of Ms Hoppe: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.'

The reality star's altercation with Tomic came just a day after two AFL players were kicked out of the league's COVID-19 hub for a brawl outside the same strip club.

Richmond Tigers players Sydney Stack and Callum Coleman-Jones were sitting on a bench outside the venue eating kebabs in the early hours of September 4 when a man confronted them.

CCTV showed the man being knocked to the ground in the push and shove.

Stack, 20, and Coleman-Jones, 21, were both suspended for the remainder of 2020.
