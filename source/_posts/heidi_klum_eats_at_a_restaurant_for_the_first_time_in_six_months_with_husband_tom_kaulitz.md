On the outing, Heidi had her blonde locks down with bangs, and wore a black top with gold graphics of zippers, black jeans and black leather shoe boots. 

She accessorized with bracelets, a black leather purse and wore reflective sunglasses and a black protective mask amid the ongoing pandemic.

Klum's public outing to the restaurant comes as California has slowly lifted restrictions on indoor/outdoor dining as the pandemic has lasted more than six months.
