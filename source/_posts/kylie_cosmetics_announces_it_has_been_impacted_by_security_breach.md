End of an era: Keeping Up With The Kardashians announced it would be ending next year 

Before becoming a makeup mogul, however, Kylie starred on her family's reality series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 

Sadly, the series announced it would be ending next year, over a decade after premiering in 2007.    

Kim Kardashian and Kylie reportedly ushered in the end of the show, after they both threatened to leave, forcing 'momager' Kris Jenner's hand.

A source told The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements. She doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.

'Filming the show meant having to be in LA with her family - now is free to fly off on holiday, or follow Travis Scott on his next tour.'
