She is a popular This Morning correspondent who first found fame when she was crowned the winner of Big Brother in 2010.

And Josie Gibson looked radiant as ever as she departed a gym in her native Bristol on Tuesday with her son Reggie, who turns two this month, by her side. 

The TV presenter, 35, showcased her curves as she donned a black crop top along with a matching pair of leggings. 

Out and about: Josie Gibson, 35, looked radiant as ever as she departed a gym in her native Bristol on Tuesday with her son Reggie, who turns two this month, by her side

Carrying a black bag, Josie kept her look casual for the day as she also sported a pair of matching trainers.

The star, who shares Reggie with her ex Terry, looked stunning as she let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders.

Holding hands with Reggie, Josie later picked him up and cradled him in her arm as she made her way home.    

In July, Josie revealed that her former partner Terry has moved out of her home once again, after he re-entered the lives of her and Reggie.

At the start of June, the former Big Brother winner admitted that she was still in love with her ex, after he moved back into her home during the COVID-19 lockdown.

But the Bristolian has now told new! magazine of Terry: 'He's moved out now. I'm choosing to do it on my own for a little bit at the moment. My sisters help, I'm very lucky. I want to put all my efforts into being a mum.'

The bubbly TV personality also went on to share her ambitions for her sole offspring, saying: 'I want Reg to grow into something amazing, like a space engineer, something like that. I want him to excel.'

Josie and Terry initially went their separate ways just four months after Reggie was born, with the star admitting that the pair 'never got on'.

However, her words were far more glowing in June, when she made appearance on ITV's Loose Women ahead of Terry moving out.

She said of her complicated relationship with her ex: 'He is one of those people you can't live with you can't live without. Terry is asthmatic, so we waited for three weeks. I couldn't take Reggie to the supermarket anymore so he moved in.'

On how they were coping with residing under the same roof, the reality star said: 'We have never got on so well.'

When asked whether she believed there was a chance they could rekindle their romance, she replied: 'We still stay in separate rooms but yeah, I love him to bits.

'When there is a pandemic you realise the little things are so trivial. The big things are important. What we used to argue about seems so trivial, so unimportant.'

'Who knows, I hope so,' the media personality said on whether the pair would continue to live with each other once the restrictions were lifted.

She continued: 'I really hope so. Seeing him and Reggie together is golden. It is so lovely. To see a man and his son is so special.

'They are obsessed with each-other. I have been shut up! I was the golden girl, now I am shut out.'

Josie and Terry, who has never been photographed out in public with the star, decided to call it quits last January after a series of arguments.

She said last month: 'We had a great big falling out because he's got OCD and I had too many shoes in the hallway. But now when people are struggling to breath, you just think "what a stupid thing to argue about!"'

At the time, Josie admitted that while they were getting on well, she wasn't sure about wanting to reignite a romance with her ex - but she didn't rule it out.

She said: 'We're still in separate rooms and taking things one step at a time... I need him to realise where it all went wrong and where we've got to put things right.'

Josie added that she is not the 'innocent one', insisting that both of them have things they need to work on.

She admitted that she initially felt unsupported by Terry when their son was born, saying he was not good with Reggie when he was a baby.

The star joked she had since felt left out by the father and son's growing bond, saying Reggie now prefers his father to her.

She said: 'He's moved out now. I'm choosing to do it on my own for a little bit at the moment. My sisters help, I'm very lucky. I want to put all my efforts into being a mum'
