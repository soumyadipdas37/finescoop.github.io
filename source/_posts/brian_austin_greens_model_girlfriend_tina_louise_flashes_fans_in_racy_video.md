She's the tattooed bombshell who has been linked to Beverly Hills, 90210 star Brian Austin Green.

And it's easy to see why Tina Louise has amassed a following of almost 2.5 million fans on Instagram judging by her latest post. 

In a short clip posted to her account, the 39-year-old tries on a number of different bikinis.

The skimpy swimwear could barely cover her curves, with most of the pieces featuring G-string bottoms.

At one point, she almost revealed more than she bargained for as she pulled a bralette down over her chest.

She luckily avoided flashing her fans, which could have resulted in an Instagram ban as the social media giant prohibits topless images of women.

Tina promised her fans that they could see the full video of her bikini session over on her Patreon account.

Patreon, like OnlyFans, is a subscription-based website where creators can offer extra content to their followers for a price.

Tina's Patreon offers three different tiers, with the lowest membership costing just $5.50 a month.

The next level, $27.50 per month, gives fans access to her private Snapchat account, along with access to some of her 'uncensored photography' and a 'private monthly video'.

The third and most expensive tier costs $50 a month, and gives subscribers everything in the lower two tiers, plus a limited-edition signed poster.

Tina has gone from social media star to bona fide celebrity since her fling with Brian made headlines in July. 

She was spotted with the Anger Management star on a Los Angeles beach last week, following rumours the pair were no longer seeing each other. 

The father of four, who is separated from wife Megan Fox, was unable to take his eyes off the bombshell during the outing.

He had reportedly split with Tina at the end of July after a month of dating, only for them to seemingly reconcile weeks later.

It comes after Brian told his Instagram followers he would 'never say never' to getting back with Megan.

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he said during a livestream earlier this month.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'

Meghan started dating rapper Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker, less than a month after her split with Brian.
