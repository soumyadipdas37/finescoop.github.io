Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich suffered a devastating defeat to German underdogs Hoffenheim. 

The game was Hansi Flick’s 39th competitive game in charge of Bayern but his men struggled without star players Lewandowski and Goretzka, losing 4-1. 

The result comes just three days before Bayern face Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup Final but all is to play for as Lucien Favre's men also suffered a shock 2-0 defeat Augsburg on Saturday. 

Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich were beaten 4-1 by Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena

Bayern Munich

Team: Neuer, Pavard, Kimmich, Gnarby, Sane, Zirkee, Boateng, Davies, Tolisso, Muller, Alaba

Hoffenheim

Team: Baumann, Kaderabek, Bicakcic, Geiger, Dabbur, Baumgartner, Samassekou, Vogt, Akpoguma, Kramaric, Posch



Hoffenheim took the lead just 15 minutes into the game through a stunning set piece. It was Bicakcic who found space in the very crowded 6-yard box to header home Hoffenheim’s corner.

The German underdogs didn’t stop there as they punished another defensive error from Bayern just moments later.

After just 24 minutes Hoffenheim secured a two-goal advantage with Munas Dabbur’s superb chip over Manuel Neuer.

There was, however, a quick VAR check for offside but the goal was given.

Bayern did, however, manage to pull one back just before the halfway mark a passage of sharp passing opened up the opportunity for Sane to find Joshua Kimmich.

Sane provided a deep cross, which saw the ball end up with Kimmich – who curled it into the top right corner.

Nevertheless, Hoffenheim fought back once more, with super-sub Bebou ploughing down the right hand-side and laying off Kramaric. 

The 29-year-old took a touch before guiding the ball into to the corner to put another one past deflated Neuer.
