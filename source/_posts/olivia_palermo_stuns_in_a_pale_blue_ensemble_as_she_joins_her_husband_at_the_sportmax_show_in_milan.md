The city is hosting 23 shows over the next five days- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks. 

It was a busy day for Olivia and Johannes as they also attended the Hugo Boss fashion show. 

The City star looked every inch the fashion maven in an oversized double breasted blazer and matching cropped trousers.

She rounded off her look with pointed white heels and carried a petite white envelope clutch bag.

The beauty swept her locks into a sleek ponytail for the occasion, and finished her glam with a sleek make-up palette.

Meanwhile, her husband Johannes looked dapper in a houndstooth coat. 

Olivia rose to fame starring alongside Whitney Port in The City, a New York-based spin-off of the popular MTV reality program, The Hills.

She has been married to German model Johannes since 2014, with the couple celebrating six years of marriage on June 21.

The Edit blogger originally met Johannes through friends when she was attending The New School back in 2008.

'It's something I have always thought to do,' Olivia told InStyle at the time.

'It was just a matter of when timing was right. I think after 10 years, working on enough collaborations, my brand is changing and going into the next phase.'
