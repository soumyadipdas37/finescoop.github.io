Disgraced Bachelorette contestant Jess Glasgow has been charged with drug possession.

Disgraced Bachelorette contestant Jess Glasgow (pictured) has been charged with drug possession. The Noosa councillor was set to face Noosa Magistrates Court on Tuesday to face charges of possessing dangerous drugs. However, the 37-year-old did not appear before the court as he is awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test

His defence lawyer Chantelle Allen supplied a medical certificate to verify the claim. 

The matter was adjourned by Magistrate Haydn Stjernqvist, who said a warrant for Glasgow's arrest will lay on file.   

He is now expected to face court on September 8. 

Speaking to the Courier Mail on Tuesday, Jess claimed the matter is all a misunderstanding. 

'I'm not guilty. There were some hiccups with my friend. He was in my car,' he told the paper, adding that he would take a drug test to prove he was clean. 

The former reality star was pulled over by police on July 18 and taken to Noosa Police Station for a breath test.

Jess went on to tell The Courier Mail that he's embarked on an acting career and is actually playing a drug dealer in upcoming film about the 'Gold Coast's underbelly'.   

'Funnily enough I'm playing a real estate agent drug dealer. I'm playing the main guy who shoots everyone,' he said.      

Jess was booted from The Bachelorette after making inappropriate comments towards Angie Kent and several female producers last year.

He was caught on camera flirting with producers and making distasteful remarks to Angie during a group date.

'You made me feel uncomfortable. You took it too far. You're going to have to leave,' Angie later told him at the cocktail party before dismissing him from the show.   

In October 2019, the mayor of Noosa, Tony Wellington, said in a statement: 'With his appearance on the reality TV show The Bachelorette, Councillor Jess Glasgow has revealed behaviour that is totally inappropriate for a Noosa councillor, indeed for any individual.'

'The behaviour displayed was misogynistic, crude and highly offensive.'

Mr Wellington went on to say that Jess brought the council's name into 'disrepute' and 'undermined' its the good reputation.

As of February 2020, Mr Glasgow was still working for Noosa council. 

In a further statement to Daily Mail Australia, made in February, a Noosa Council spokesman said: 'The matter was referred to the Office of the Independent Assessor for further consideration.'

'Any queries should be referred to the OIA who are still considering the matter.'

'CEO Brett de Chastel said Cr Jess Glasgow remains a serving councillor at Noosa Council.'

According to the Noosa Council website in February, the local politician still worked for the community, as his details were then still available online. 

Jess' special areas of interest for Noosa include: traffic and transport, youth issues housing affordability and homelessness.

His other areas of expertise also include: local laws and public safety, as well as sport and recreation.

Daily Mail Australia has approached Jess Glasgow and Noosa Council for comment.
