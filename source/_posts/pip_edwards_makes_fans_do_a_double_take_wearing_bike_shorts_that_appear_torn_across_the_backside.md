She's the fashion designer who is not afraid to take a risk when it comes her outfits.

And on Saturday, Pip Edwards baffled fans when she wore bike shorts that appeared to have tears across the backside while out for a walk with boyfriend Michael Clarke.

The 40-year-old P.E. Nation founder shared a photo of herself posing in her sporty outfit while standing the banks of a river on her Instagram.

She teamed her bottoms with a long jumper with the number 80 printed on the back. 

The blonde beauty also shared a photo of her former Australian cricket captain beau also looking out on the banks of the river. 

Upon inspection in another photo, Pip's seeming ripped navy shorts in fact featured large printed strokes of orange and white that made her derrière appear bare.

On Friday, she took her outfit to another level with a classy black and white ensemble for a night out with friends.

One could mistake her ensemble for something inspired by a nun's habit - but it was far from it. 

She posted a mirror selfie of her outfit - a long black dress with a white neckline trim and cut out details on the waist, teamed with a cropped bomber jacket and completed her look with a pair of white boots.

Pip's avant garde ensemble comes after she recently shared a sweet photo of herself cuddled up to Michael inside his designer closet this week.

Reports surfaced Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly Clarke became public knowledge.

The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee.

Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month.
