Gal Gadot gave her 41.5 million Instagram followers an intimate look at her new film Red Notice's coronavirus safety measures on Wednesday.

The 35-year-old Wonder Woman star shared a photo of herself getting tested for the novel coronavirus via a nasal swab in a series of photos.

The safety measure was a necessary precaution before she could return to the set of her upcoming Netflix action comedy Red Notice, which also stars Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Ryan Reynolds.

Gal was decked out in a white graphic T-shirt reading, 'Après Corona,' which is French for 'After Corona.'

'cannot wait for this s**t to end,' read the humorous text below it.

She also had on a pair of muted gray shorts and wore her raven tresses back in a bun while showing off her makeup-free face.

'Getting ready to head back to the Red Notice set but prep looks a little different now..,' she wrote, adding the hashtag '#staysafe.'

Gal's film Red Notice will pack plenty of star power, thanks to her costars Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds.

In an Instagram photo announcing the beginning of shooting back in January, Dwayne described his character as 'the world's greatest tracker' who works for INTERPOL, while gal's character is 'the world's greatest art thief' and Ryan's character is 'the world's greatest conman.'

'In the world of international crime, an Interpol issued RED NOTICE is a global alert to hunt down and capture the worlds most wanted,' he wrote to summarize the film.

Production was halted as the coronavirus began to spread around the world in March, though it has now resumed with new safety measures to limit transmission.

The film was originally to be distributed by Universal Pictures, but the studio balked at the large $125–150 million budget.

Netflix, which was a runner-up in the initial bidding war, stepped in to distribute the film in Universal's place.

Gal will also be starring in the upcoming Wonder Woman 1984, which is currently set for an October 2 release date after multiple postponements.

The film was completed months before its initial December 2019 release date before being delayed until June 2020.

Once the pandemic was in full swing, it was delayed again until August 2020, before being pushed back to October.

The actress will reprise her role as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince, and she'll be reunited with her costar Chris Pine, whose character Steve Trevor appeared to perish in a plane crash during the First World War in the previous film.

Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig will round out the cast as the film's villains, Maxwell Lord and Cheetah.
