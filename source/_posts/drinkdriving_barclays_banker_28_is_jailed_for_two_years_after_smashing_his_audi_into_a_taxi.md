A Barclays banker has been jailed for two years after smashing his Audi into a taxi before leaving two sisters for dead and lying to police about his car being stolen.

Sohail Yousif, 28, was driving home to Great Lever, Bolton, after drinking in a Manchester nightclub on February 9 last year when he ploughed into the back of a taxi at 4.20am. 

Instead of calling for help he fled the scene and shortly afterwards called police to lie about a thief stealing his car keys. 

Twins Hannah and Rachel Marsh, 22, were both injured when the Audi smashed into their taxi.

Hannah's pelvis was fractured and Rachel suffered a chipped tooth and soreness to her legs and back. 

Muhammad Naseem, the driver of the private hire taxi, suffered whiplash in the impact and his car was written off.

Yousif, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, works as a financial advisor for Barclays. 

He was finally caught after police found traces of his saliva on the airbag of his 130mph A4 car - which had inflated on impact with the taxi.

But Yousif kept up his pretence for over 18 months before admitting he was the driver earlier this month. He had a previous conviction for drink driving from 2014.

In a statement, college student Hannah said she had been left with 'emotional trauma and serious anxiety which overwhelmed her doing day to day activities'.

She said she no longer rides in taxis, finds it difficult to cross roads and was forced to take some time away from college.

At Bolton Crown Court, Yousif admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting justice. He was jailed for 26 months. 

Prosecutor Joshua Bowker said: 'Mr Naseem was driving to Great Lever with two passengers, sisters Hannah and Rachel Marsh and was turning around a fairly sharp bend at 30mph when he was struck from behind by a black Audi.

'He lost control of his cab and collided with some railings at the side of the road and came to a stop. Mr Naseem had to force the door of car open and called for an ambulance and the police and saw three males walking away from the Audi.'

The taxi's two passengers were 'in distress' and Hannah had a 'panic attack', according to Mr Bowker. 

He added: 'The Audi was travelling at speed as it approached the taxi at the bend and failed to slow down despite the taxi being in view for some time.

'The collision forced the taxi into railings. The sisters went home and Hannah went to bed but couldn't move in the morning and was taken to the hospital and kept in overnight. 

In a statement, college student Hannah (pictured) said she had been left with 'emotional trauma and serious anxiety which overwhelmed her doing day to day activities'

'She had a fractured pelvis and other fractures which didn't require any surgery.

'She had a number of appointments and reviews before being discharged. Mr Naseem had whiplash-type injuries and his car was written off.

'The insurance covered it but he lost custom. Rachel suffered soreness to her legs and back and received treatment for a chipped tooth.'

Mr Bowker revealed how Yousif called the police 'some hours after the crash' to report the theft of his jacket - which held his car keys.

'Some hours after the crash a theft was reported by the defendant to police in which he said his jacket had been stolen whilst at a club in Manchester and his car keys were in the jacket pocket,' he said.

The taxi's two passengers were 'in distress' and Hannah  (pictured left and righ) had a 'panic attack', according to prosecutor Joshua Bowker

'Officers spoke to the defendant on the phone to try and establish where in the club he had been but the defendant was vague and unspecific and couldn't give any exact directions as to where he was.

'Forensic investigations later found the defendants saliva on the deployed drivers airbag and he was arrested and interviewed. 

'He answered no comment to all questions asked. Aggravating factors are the speed the car was travelling, the consumption of alcohol and of course him fleeing from the scene.'

In mitigation for Yousif, defence lawyer Mr Soheil Khan said the defendent 'offered his unreserved apology for his behaviour'. He added that Yousif 'expressed remorse, shame and empathy for the victims'. 

Yousif (pictured) was also banned from driving for three years and will have to take an extended re-test

'He comes from a decent household and he knows he must hang his head in shame,' Mr Khan added.

'All he can do is apologise for his deplorable actions which occurred when he was in a state of panic. He's spoken of well by those that know him, has achieved a university education and held down employment despite the current climate.

'He is a financial advisor for Barclays, is currently engaged to his partner of three years and does charity work. There's been no repetition of offending in the 19 months since.

'I'm not diminishing the significant harm caused to the victims which has been severe but is a sobering experience for this defendant and he has genuine remorse and regret for his actions and the harm it's caused. He would not trouble the courts again.'

Sentencing Judge Graeme Smith told Yousif: 'You are not the sort of defendant typically seen in these courts. You come from a decent family home, had a university education and have been able to obtain and maintain employment and supported your father through family difficulties.

'References speak highly of your character and involvement in the community with charity works so these offences come as a surprise.

'You had been drinking on this occasion but because you fled the scene there's no information about whether or not and to what extent you were over the drink-drive limit. 

'However you were driving at excessive speed and had consumed alcohol and did not see the vehicle that was clearly visible.'

Judge Smith said Yousif failed to admit guilt and left the scene 'where people could have been injured'.

'Rather than hold your hands up to the offence you acted in a way which was no doubt an initial reaction of panic and then phoned and reported your car as stolen,' he said. 

'At no stage after that until very recently did you back down from that course.

'You signed a police statement and when when officers found your DNA was on the airbag of the car, even then you didn't admit any guilt. You left a scene where people could have been injured and at a time when it should have been obvious to you that they might have been injured.'

Yousif was also banned from driving for three years and will have to take an extended re-test.
