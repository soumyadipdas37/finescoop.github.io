He first publicly threw his support behind Donald Trump in June.

But conspiracy theorist Pete Evans, 47, has revealed his admiration for the controversial leader actually actually began in 2016, while he was still employed as a judge on My Kitchen Rules. 

Appearing on his Evolve podcast on Monday, the anti-vaxxer admitted his colleagues at My Kitchen Rules used to tell him to 'f**k off' when he came to work singing Trump's praises four years ago.  

'There was such distain against this man': Pete Evans, 47, (pictured) revealed on Monday that his former colleagues on My Kitchen Rules used to tell him to 'f**k off' when he came to work singing Donald Trump's praises in 2016 

'I was never interested in politics, I tell you. It wasn't until four years ago, that around this time Donald Trump was running for president up against Hillary Clinton, that's when I... got a little bit closer to what politics is.' Pete explained.    

'There was such distain against this man, and for months and months I would go into my workplace and the same people every day would be talking about Trump - this is before he was elected - saying the most vile, horrible things,' he continued. 

Pete, who starred on My Kitchen Rules with Manu Feildel and Colin Fassnidge before being boned in May, eventually decided to take a stand.

'After a month I couldn't hold my tongue anymore': Pete, (left) who starred on My Kitchen Rules with Manu Feildel (centre) and Colin Fassnidge (right) before being boned in May, said he grew frustrated after hearing his colleagues say 'vile, horrible things' about Trump in 2016

'They basically said, 'F**k off Pete, you don't know what you're talking about': Despite doing his best to convince them to 'take Trump's (pictured) personality out of the equation' and judge him based on his achievements, Pete's colleagues were less than impressed 

'After a month I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and I said to these people, 'Why are you judging somebody on a job they haven't done yet, and may not get the job? Why don't you hold your opinions and your judgment.' 

Despite doing his best to convince them to 'take Trump's personality out of the equation' and judge him based on his achievements, Pete's colleagues were less than impressed.  

'They basically said, 'F**k off Pete, you don't know what you're talking about,'' he recalled. 

Loud and proud: Since closing the door on his relationship with Channel Seven in May, Pete has been free to openly support Donald Trump's political movements. Pictured: My Kitchen Rules' Pete Evans (left),  Manu Feildel (right) 

'I went, 'Ok, well you guys are getting angry every single day. You're living in fear about something that you just have no idea what's going to happen',' he insisted.  

Since closing the door on his relationship with Channel Seven in May, Pete has been free to openly support Donald Trump's political movements. 

On several occasions, Pete has even sported a Make America Great Again hat - a cornerstone of Trump's 2016 and 2020 presidential election campaign.
