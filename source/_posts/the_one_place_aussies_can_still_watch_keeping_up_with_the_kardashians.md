Kim Kardashian announced on Wednesday that she is ending her popular reality show after 14 years on air. 

And while Keeping Up With The Kardashians will air its final season next year, Australians will still be able to watch the series after it ends on the E! network.

Every season of KUWTK is currently available to watch in Australia on the reality TV streaming service Hayu.

Gone but not forgotten! Australians will still be able to watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the foreseeable future despite the series getting the axe

Hayu also gets the latest episodes the same day as the US, so there's only a few hours difference between the episode airing in America on E! to it being available to watch on Hayu. 

E! is under the NBCUniversal umbrella along with Bravo and the Oxygen network, and Hayu has the rights to NBCUniversal content in Australia.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians will continue to be available to Australians via Hayu for the foreseeable future, which will more than likely include the show's final season next year.

Now streaming! Every season of KUWTK is currently available to watch in Australia on the reality TV streaming service Hayu

The entire series and its spin-offs will also remain on Hayu for as long as the streaming service holds the rights to NBCUniversal content. 

In addition to hosting KUWTK, Hayu is also home to various Kardashian spin-offs, including Life of Kylie, I Am Cait, Rob & Chyna, Flip It Like Disick, Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project, and more.

And with episodes being available on Hayu the same day that they air in the US, Australians will be able to watch the KUWTK series finale on the same day as Americans do when it airs next year.

In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, 39, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives. 

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'

'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'
