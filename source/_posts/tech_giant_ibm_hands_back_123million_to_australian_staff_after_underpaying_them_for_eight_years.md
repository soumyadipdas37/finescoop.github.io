Tech multinational IBM has handed back $12million to its Australian employees after underpaying them for eight years.

As of February, 1,647 workers across Australia had been back-paid a total of $12.3million for underpayments going back to 2012, the Fair Work Ombudsman says.

More underpayments are still being identified and IBM must repay all employees by October 16 as part of an enforceable undertaking signed with the ombudsman.

The company failed to apply more than 15 award entitlements and conditions. These included vehicle allowances, superannuation entitlements and annual leave loading.

A significant number of casuals at IBM's Ballarat contact centre were also paid the national minimum wage, instead of higher rates under the relevant award.

IBM Australia Ltd and IBM Global Financing Australia Limited reported the underpayments to the ombudsman last year.

Individual back payments range from less than $1 to more than $145,000.
