Scarlett, who shares Rose Dorothy with her French ex-husband Romain Dauriac, looked stylish and chic in her off-duty look. 

The black one-piece was given shape with the belted middle, while she added a classic touch with her Birkenstock sandals. 

She scraped her blonde hair into a loose bun while also rocking thick framed glasses and toting a handbag on a long strap.  

Scarlett and Colin, who began dating in 2017, got engaged in May of last year. Due to the coronavirus, the pair have had to push back their nuptials.

When Jost appeared on Watch What Happens Live last month, host Andy Cohen asked if the coronavirus will impact how him and Scarlett tie the knot.

'Of course, because we don’t know what’s even legally allowed, right?' replied Jost, who was referencing the safety guidelines that warn against large groups of people from gathering in an effort to quell the spread of the pandemic.

'This is not the time to get all your elderly, at-risk relatives together in one big group,' he said. 'I don’t know when that moment will be.'

In his new book A Very Punchable Face: A Memoir, Jost recalled how Johansson initially struck him as 'intimidatingly sophisticated' when the first crossed paths on the set of SNL in 2006 when she was hosting and he was writing.

'I remember her being beautiful, smart, sweet, and intimidatingly sophisticated,' Jost wrote, hailing the A-list actress for having 'a grace and a smile that I've still never seen in any other human.'

He credited her in the book who has instilled in him confidence, both personally and professionally.

The pair started dating in 2017 and got engaged in May 2019. She has been married twice previously, to Ryan Reynolds from 2008-2011 and Romain Dauriac from 2014-2017.
