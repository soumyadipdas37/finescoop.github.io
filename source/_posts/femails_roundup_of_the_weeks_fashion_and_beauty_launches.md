When it comes to fashion, we are all inspired by what we see; whether it be a well-dressed celebrity, a blow-your-mind catwalk presentation or even a super stylish every-day passerby.

As fashion editors, we're moved by all of the above, and then some. We're exposed to under-the-radar labels; we get a first-hand look at collections months before they hit stores; we're tapped into brands with chic-yet-cheap offerings and we shop - a lot.

To share our knowledge, FEMAIL brings you Style Swoon, a weekly series of the latest, greatest and on the verge. We hope this Friday series will serve as a buying guide and point of inspiration for the clotheshorses and fashion fanatics alike.

Today’s direct-to-consumer drop and subsequent product roll-outs are targeted to strong and savvy females of all ages.   

The first item to launch is the Shimmer Dreams three-piece kit.

There are three different kits  (Divine, Opulence and Ethereal), each one defined by a different fragrance to represent each of the girls' personalities.

Veteran: Baby Phat Beauty is expanding on the legacy Kimora has been building for the past twenty years

Baby Phat Beauty is expanding on the legacy Kimora has been building for the past twenty years. 

'When I launched Baby Phat in 1999, I had to fight for a seat at the table in both the high-fashion and streetwear worlds,' said the supermodel.

'I did that by staying true to myself and bringing up an entire generation who embraced diversity, body-positivity and body-confidence all while being unapologetically glam and sexy. 

'Buying back the brand has given me the opportunity to tell that story all over again to a new generation--a generation I raised. Launching into beauty, feels like the most relevant way to tell that story in today’s landscape.'

To bring Baby Phat Beauty to the masses, Kimora and her daughters  teamed up and the Beauty and Wellness Incubator, HatchBeauty Brands.

They will release another line for the 2020 holiday season and then continue with additional options in skincare and color in 2021. 

'We are excited to dive into the beauty space with a unique multi-generational perspective,' said Ming Lee Simmons. 

Her sister, Aoki, echoed her enthusiasm by saying, 'Brands represent more than just products in today’s world, and it’s important for us to continue to be part of cultural and beauty conversations as we forge a new path for girls who look like us.'

'We are excited about the opportunity to partner with Kimora and her daughters to help architect the brand’s evolution for this new generation,' Preston Bottomy, HatchBeauty Brands

Each Shimmer Dreams Kit can be purchased on BabyPhatBeauty.com for $45.00.

At home in style: On Thursday of this week, celeb-adored outerwear company The Mighty Company launched The Casual Collection

On Thursday of this week, celeb-adored outerwear company The Mighty Company  launched The Casual Collection. 

The Mighty Company is known for their cool leather jackets in a color palette of subtle psychedelia.

'In a year where we’ve all had to find comfort in our own solitude, we wanted to create a collection that would imbue some joie de vivre into the everyday,' said the brand.

'We felt that casualwear deserved to be as exciting as anything else you wear. Because while we always aspire to capture bits of happiness within our collections, this year has meant figuring out the things that make you most happy in your own company. 

'We were determined to make clothes that did just that.'

With inspiration from California skate culture, 80’s rainbow-like home workout videos, and the colors of the LA sky changing from day to night, the 12-piece Casual Collection was born. 

Comprised of soft cottons, pastel french terry, rainbow embroidery, glittering nylons and neon stitching and dyed in their most beloved signature hues (like hot pink!), all you need is a pair of roller skates to complete the epic look!

One of a kind: 'In a year where we’ve all had to find comfort in our own solitude, we wanted to create a collection that would imbue some joie de vivre into the everyday,' said the brand

This week, STAUD released their second drop from the New Balance X STAUD collaboration.

Of the second collection, STAUD says, 'For fall 2020, we asked ourselves what the classic, chic version of our playful, rainbow spring season would be, while keeping the artful, esoteric design details that lie at the heart of our brand.

'The answer was a version of our signature ponte styles combined with NB Sleek for high-performance wear, made transitional for all aspects of life.'

Each piece is designed to complement the other and can seamlessly be worn to the gym and beyond.

It's elegant activewear with a cool 90's vibe at its best.
