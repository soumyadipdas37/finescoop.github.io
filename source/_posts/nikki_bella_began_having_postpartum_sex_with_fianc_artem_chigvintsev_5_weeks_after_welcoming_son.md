Total Bellas star Nikki Bella began having postpartum sex with her fiancé Artem Chigvintsev five weeks after welcoming their first child - son Matteo Artemovich - on July 31.

'I didn't even make it to the six-week point, I just started at five. I was like I'm healed, I'm fine!' the 36-year-old retired WWE wrestler revealed on Wednesday's episode of The Bellas Podcast.

'Even though last night it didn't seem fine, but that's okay. It was a little different. I felt like organs were about to drop out. I was like, "Shoot! Did I mess up?"' 

TMI alert! Total Bellas star Nikki Bella began having postpartum sex with her fiancé Artem Chigvintsev five weeks after welcoming their first child - son Matteo Artemovich - on July 31 (pictured September 14)

The 36-year-old retired WWE wrestler revealed on Wednesday's episode of The Bellas Podcast: 'I didn't even make it to the six-week point, I just started at five. I was like I'm healed, I'm fine!'

At that, Nikki's twin sister Brie Danielson said of her TMI confession: 'Okay Nicole! Enough about all the gross stuff going on with our vaginas, especially yours.'

In true twin fashion, Brie welcomed her second child - son Buddy Dessert - less than 24 hours before her sibling gave birth.

Bella (born Stephanie Nicole Garcia-Colace) previously revealed September 14 that she was getting her 'groove back' and 'feeling more like herself,' but her breasts were 'still off limits' to the Russian-American 38-year-old.

Artem is currently preparing a Rumba with his dance partner - The Bachelorette #11 Kaitlyn Bristowe - for the Disney-themed episode of Dancing With the Stars, which airs Monday on ABC.

It will take a couple days for the Canadian 35-year-old to get the results of the hour-long MRI she went through Thursday morning for her injured ankle.

Last episode, Chigvintsev and Bristowe's Foxtrot tied with Justina Machado and partner Sasha Farber for highest score of the night with 22 points despite her injury.
