As we move into autumn, a cosy sweater dress is just the item we need to combat the changing season. 

Not only can it be styled with trainers for a comfortable and cool off-duty look, but paired with heels or boots this type of dress is perfect for work, the school run or date-night. 

The Yidarton Womens Jumper Dress is a brilliant discovery on Amazon and has a growing fan-base lusting after its blend of style and comfort. 

The Yidarton Womens Jumper Dress is a big hit with Amazon shoppers who have raved about the super flattering cut and elegant design 

With over 500 reviews (and counting) shoppers have been seriously impressed with the quality, cut and fit - not to mention the super affordable price point of £19.99 (depending on what colour and size you opt for). 

It can be hard to feel both cosy and polished but that's exactly what you get with the Yidarton Womens Jumper Dress. 

Detailed with a tie waist to accentuate your figure and an elegant v-neck design, it's been described by shoppers as 'really flattering', 'lovely shape' and 'very soft and comfortable'. 

Available in seasonal autumnal hues like brown, black, khaki and green, the dress is perfect for the new season. It also comes in a brighter pink, yellow and light blue, and is available in size S to XL. 

One reviewer wrote: 'Loved the whole product, colour, quality and looks great on, comfortable and easy to move about in. Purchased in another colour because I loved it so much!'

'Oh my this dress is gorgeous!' commented another shopper. 'It is really well made, nice quality knit fabric, and exactly like pictured. I got a blue one and I love it. The only problem is, which colour do I order next!'

The Yidarton jumper dress is available in a midi dress and in shorter styles which sit just about the knee 

A third raved: This dress is absolutely beautiful. Really well made and fits like a dream. Very comfortable and warm and somehow made my little legs look really long?!'

The knitted midi dress can easily be styled up or down depending on the occasion. For a more seductive look, it can be worn slightly off the shoulder and paired with heels, but it can equally be worn with tights and boots for a cosy, comfortable look.  

One shopper wrote: 'Not only is it really soft but it keeps you warm! No need to wear a top/shirt underneath!!! Its not too long or short in length and you can alter the neckline to make it higher or more deep. This is a great dress for all occasions (dates, dinner, work etc).'

Another added: 'Drop dead gorgeous. It is comfortable, flattering, nice fabric, beautiful colour. Exactly what you get on the picture... And for this price, an absolute bargain.'
