Little Mix: The Search was originally thought as a rival for the X Factor, however music mogul Simon has decided to rest the show this year.  

The group, who switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018, were originally formed on The X Factor in 2011. 

Little Mix: The Search continues tomorrow at 6:45pm on BBC One.
