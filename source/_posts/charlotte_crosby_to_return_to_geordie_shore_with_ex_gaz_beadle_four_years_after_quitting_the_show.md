Charlotte Crosby is returning to Geordie Shore for the first time in four years for a special series.

The reality star, 30, will be joined by her fellow OG castmates, including her ex Gaz Beadle, who she split from in 2016 when he reportedly slept with Jemma Lucy during their tumultuous five year romance. 

In a post shared to her Instagram Stories on Monday, the influencer enthused she's 'excited' to make a comeback as Geordie Shore: Their Story is due to air on MTV from September 22.

In a trailer clip uploaded to the show's Instagram account, model Holly, 28, said: 'I had absolutely no idea how big Geordie Shore was going to get!'

Father-of-two Gaz, 32, who shares children Chester, two, and Primrose, eight months, with fiancée Emma McVey, 27, reflected on his days as a Lothario as he admitted: 'Back then I was so arrogant.'

The media personality later detailed his shift from being a party animal to a doting parent after leaving the show in 2017 as he added: 'It's that kind of feeling that like deep down you were ready to be a dad.'

Sophie, 30, who starred on the series until last year, confessed she was initially apprehensive about joining the line-up as she told fans: 'I just kept thinking, ''why does Marnie [her cousin] want to do this?''' 

'I was in such a bad state of mind', new mum Marnie, 28, cried in the video after welcoming her baby boy with fiancé Casey Johnson in October last year.
