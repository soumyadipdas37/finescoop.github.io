Matt Hancock today gave the green light to grandparents in local lockdown areas to look after their grandchildren as he announced a childcare exemption will now apply to a ban on households mixing. 

Residents in many areas across England which are subject to local coronavirus restrictions have been banned from meeting with people from outside their immediate households. 

The Health Secretary said he had 'heard the concerns' about the impact this has had on parents who are reliant on childcare in order to do their jobs. 

Mr Hancock said that as a result the ban on households mixing in local lockdown areas is being lifted when it comes to childcare. 

The exemption will apply to both informal and formal childcare settings, Mr Hancock said, paving the way for grandparents to help out again.

Speaking in the House of Commons this afternoon, Mr Hancock said: ‘We know from experience that local action can work when local communities come together to follow the rules, tackle the virus and keep themselves safe.

‘I know how hard this is. We are constantly looking for how we can ensure measures bear down on the virus as much as possible while protecting both lives and livelihoods.

‘I have heard the concerns about the impact of local action on childcare arrangements.

‘For many, informal childcare arrangements are a lifeline without which they couldn't do their jobs.

‘So today I am able to announce a new exemption for looking after children under the age of 14 or vulnerable adults where that is necessary for caring purposes.

‘This covers both formal and informal arrangements. It does not allow for play dates or parties but it does mean that a consistent childcare relationship that is vital for somebody to get to work is allowed.’

He added: ‘I hope this change will provide clarity and comfort to many people who are living with these local restrictions.’

Mr Hancock also confirmed the Government's plans to provide people on low incomes who need to self-isolate with Covid-19 with £500 payments from next Monday.    

He said self-isolation 'can be tough' especially for people who cannot work from home and that he does not 'want anyone having to worry about their finances while they’re doing the right thing'.

'So we will introduce a new £500 isolation support payment for people on low incomes who can’t work because they have tested positive or are asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace,' he said.
