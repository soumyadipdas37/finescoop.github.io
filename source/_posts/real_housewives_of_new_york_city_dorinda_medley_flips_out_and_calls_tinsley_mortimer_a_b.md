Dorinda Medley flipped out and called Tinsley Mortimer a 'b****' one last time as she ended her run on The Real Housewives Of New York City in Thursday's season finale.

The season 12 finale entitled 'Viva la Dysfunction,' ended with Dorinda, 55, peacefully enjoying a Christmastime 'Drag Queen Bingo' event thrown by Sonja Morgan, 56.

In a sweet moment, Leah McSweeney, 37, thanked the cast for opening their hearts to her, and recalled how Tinsley had initially introduced her to them.

At the mention of her former frenemy's name, Dorinda suddenly freaked out on Leah.

'No! I'm not doing that s***!' she spat, walking away. 'Sorry! F*** you.'

'Are you f***ing kidding me?' Leah cried, as Dorinda replied, 'I will not give Tinsley that. F*** you. I won't. Tinsley did s***. Tinsley almost ruined our show.'

Tinsley, who'd starred on four seasons of RHONY, left in the middle of season 12 to move to Chicago in order to be with her fiancé Scott Kluth, 41.

In August, Dorinda announced her departure from the series after six seasons, with some press reports speculating that either her anger issues or drinking had become a problem for the show. 

Ramona Singer, 63, told Leah that Dorinda had clearly had too much to drink.

Dorinda then stomped back over to Leah and waggled her finger in her face.

Too much: 'Are you f***ing kidding me?' Leah cried, as Dorinda replied, 'I will not give Tinsley that. F*** you. I won't. Tinsley did s***. Tinsley almost ruined our show'

'You're gonna give a toast to Tinsley Mortimer, who left the show and breached her contract, and left over nothing?' Dorinda asked her.

'Exactly! I agree!' Sonja shouted. 'If you're not here, you don't get kudos.'

'You don't mention her name,' Dorinda informed Leah, who retorted, 'I will say whatever I want, actually.'

'I am a principled person,' Dorinda continued, gesturing at Leah and a nearby Luann de Lesseps, 55, with her hand, which had just undergone surgery.

'That hand is working pretty well over there,' Luann cracked, as Dorinda said, 'No it's not! It's sore. You should be more appreciative of it.'

'You're spitting all over!' Ramona yelled at Dorinda, who repeated that Tinsley had 'breached the contract' and 'fled' the show.

Sonja muttered that she'd invited Tinsley to the bingo event, but she hadn't shown.

'Try principle,' Dorinda rambled on, as Ramona made the universal sign for crazy around her ear. 'F*** that s***.'

'She's obsessed with Tinsley,' Leah marveled to Luann, who was sitting next to her. 'All I was saying was that Tinsley left and it gave me a chance to bond with everybody, and I love all of you. That was what I was literally trying to tell her ...I love her!'

'And you're still here,' Luann pointed out.

In the distance, Dorinda could be heard venting to Sonja about Tinsley, saying, 'She left us. And she's a b****.'

Luann was horrified, telling Leah, 'She's going beyond, and now this is beyond my wildest expectations of her as a person. I'm really freaked out.'

Harsh words: In the distance, Dorinda could be heard venting to Sonja about Tinsley, saying, 'She left us. And she's a b****'

'I don't want that b****'s name mentioned,' Dorinda continued.

'She's got work to do,' Luann said of Dorinda. 'We've all got work to do. When you don't grow, that's a great example over there.'

'I'm done,' Leah insisted, to which Luann countered, 'I'm not. I know it's done. There's a lot of pain and a lot of s*** going on in there.'

Work needed: 'She's got work to do,' Luann said of Dorinda. 'We've all got work to do. When you don't grow, that's a great example over there'

The two of them decided they no longer wanted to deal with Dorinda that night, as Lu joked, 'Happy F***ing Holidays.'

In a preview of next week's RHONY reunion show, guest star Tinsley told Dorinda she needed to take accountability for her actions on RHONY, calling her apology 'way too little too late.'

The show opened on a brighter note, with cabaret star Luann recording a song called 'Viva La Diva,' written by legendary songwriters Carole Bayer Sager and Jay Landers, and produced by Desmond Child.

All of them had worked on Barbra Streisand's last record, and as Desmond helped Luann get into the right voice for her recording, he hoped that they had a hit.

Dorinda, meanwhile, was recovering from surgery to remove a 'Bible bump,' or Ganglion cyst, from her hand, a growth she described as being like an octopus, with tentacles.

The surgery was just the latest challenge she'd faced this season, after grappling with a devastating flood at her vacation home and gutting her Manhattan apartment.

Still, she seemed cheery and hopeful about her future, saying in a confessional, 'I had to go through some murky water, but I feel like now the waters are calming.'

She predicted 2020 would be a good year for her, adding, 'I deserve it. I'm a good person, Dorinda Medley, and I've fought hard to get here, and you know what? I feel good about it.'

As she walked around her apartment, still under renovation, she picked up an object from the floor, hoping it was a coin because her late husband Richard once left her those for luck.

It was just a bit of metal, and Dorinda wondered if it meant that she was going broke.

At her Upper East Side townhouse, Sonja was also in the midst of an update, revamping the interiors because she was trying to sell it.

Leah got in a holiday mood by decorating gingerbread houses with her mother Bunny and daughter Kier, 12.

She and Bunny had been working on their relationship lately, and seemed to have reached a fragile peace, which pleased Leah.

She and her sister Sarah then attended a preview of Luann's new cabaret piece, Marry F*** Kill, in which Sonja was also starring.

The show focused on sex and relationships, and saw Luann joking about how she was going to try 'not to get married, divorced or arrested' over New Year's for once.

Sonja secretly felt that Lu's material was getting old, but played along when asked who she'd 'Marry, F***, or Kill': Ramona, Dorinda or Tinsley.

'I'm gonna kill Ramona,' Sonja returned. 'Tinsley's un-f***able.' Maybe I'll marry her after her first divorce… uh, second divorce… and then that leaves me having sex with Dorinda, who may be a sleeper hit in the bed. People pleaser!'

At the event's after-party, Sonja revealed that she'd been feeling like she let herself go recently, and asked Leah to take her to work out, which Leah promised to do.

Later that week, Sonja held her Drag Queen Bingo party, which she'd thrown to raise money for GLAAD and to support the LGBTQ+ community.

Dorinda showed up in a glittery silver outfit with a turban on her head, and joked, 'I think one of these drag queens went into my closet. I have half these clothes.'

Leah sported her 'eighth-grade Christmas dress, from 1995,' which had been created by Sex And The City designer Patricia Field.

Ramona rolled in with her platonic friend Ron on her arm, irritating Sonja who couldn't believe she'd brought a straight guy, and privately said, 'Read the room, b****.'

Sonja, however, was delighted to learn that she'd made out with him at a bar six years before.

Ron then flirted with Leah, who recalled that he'd kissed her friend months ago, and sent her a message saying that he was 'gonna f*** the life out of her.'

'You're at your prime right now,' he told Leah. 'I can make you shine.'

'Okay, thank you,' replied Leah, who rolled her eyes for the cameras.

Good effort: Ron then flirted with Leah, who recalled that he'd kissed her friend months ago, and sent her a message saying that he was 'gonna f*** the life out of her'

Sonja got onstage to give a speech, and nagged Ramona for bringing her 'boring friends.'

'Did she just say I'm boring?' Ron asked, suddenly at Leah's ear, which made her scream.

When the actual bingo game started, Dorinda got really into it, yelling 'Yes!' every time she was able to put a chip on her sheet.

Ramona spotted '69' on Dorinda's sheet and bent down, saying, 'I like 69!' before accidentally making Dorinda's chips scatter.

'This is about the community!' Sonja told Ramona. 'It's not about your va-jay-jay!'

She then brought Luann up onstage to perform Viva La Diva, which got the whole crowd dancing and singing along.

'At least it's not Happy Birthday,' cracked Dorinda, who recalled with horror Luann's Marilyn Monroe-style rendition of that song from her recent birthday dinner.

At the end of the show, special credits gave updates on the cast's recent activities.

Luann was writing a memoir, it said, and she had just sold her vacation home.

Leah said she'd grown 'so much during these last few months' of taping the show, and was ready for a new relationship. In the credits, it was revealed that she'd quit drinking again.

Sonja's update said she got a facelift and took her home off the market after getting no bids. She acknowledged that she sometimes went 'off the rails,' but refused to 'play the victim.'

Ramona's credit joked that she'd been kept busy 'maintaining 50 friendships while social distancing,' and moved to a higher floor in her building 'for more Instagrammable views.'
