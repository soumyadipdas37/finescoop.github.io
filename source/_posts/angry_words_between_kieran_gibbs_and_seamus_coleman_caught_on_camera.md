There weren't many cool heads as Kieran Gibbs received a red card in Everton's thrashing of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday afternoon. 

Gibbs was sent off after catching James Rodriguez with a raised arm, and then had an angry exchange of words with Seamus Coleman as he was walking off the pitch.

'I'll f****** do it again,' said Gibbs, walking past a group of Everton players, and the Toffees captain took exception.

Kieran Gibbs received a red card for violent conduct in West Brom's defeat to Everton

'No you won't do it again,' Coleman retorted. 'Who are you talking to, you'll do it again? Hard man... f****** hard man.'

It all started when there was controversy as Rodriguez gave Gibbs a shove by the touchline with the Albion defender reacting by catching him in the cheek with a raised arm.

Rodriguez milked it with a roll and clutch of the face and Gibbs was dismissed.

Bilic argued with Dean when they walked off and was given a red card himself, but later admitted his player 'had given the referee no choice' and said Gibbs would have been better falling to the ground himself. 

Everton ended up winning the game 5-2, leaving the Baggies rooted to the bottom of the table having conceded eight goals in their first two games back in the Premier League. 

Meanwhile Everton spent the night at the top of the table, but have now been leapfrogged by Leicester City after their own big win on Sunday.
