The Melbourne-based car sales consultant told 10 Play on Wednesday: 'I had been told that both my brothers had contracted the virus.' 

'It was very surreal and overwhelming because I didn't really know much about the virus coming into the mansion, and coming out with that news and going home to that was very scary.'

Fortunately Marg's brothers have recovered and are doing well.

She believed that she and the Bachelor had a spark, but acknowledged that it 'wasn't the strongest' connection. 

'I understood where he was coming from, he had a lot of connections and at the time our one wasn’t the strongest. So he had to do what he had to do,' she said.

Aside from the shock elimination of five hopefuls was news that filming of The Bachelor was forced to shut down.
