Brian Austin Green has been linked with television personality Courtney Stodden and Australian Instagram model Tina Louise in the wake of his split from estranged wife Megan Fox.  

But on Sunday, the Beverly Hills 90210 star opted to go it alone when he stepped out to pick up some groceries at a Ralph's grocery store in sunny Malibu.  

With the COVID-19 pandemic still raging in Southern California, the Los Angeles native wore a camouflage face covering during his time outside of quarantine.

Green, 47, kept it casual in the fashion department in charcoal sweatpants and a black t-shirt that helped show off his toned physique.

He also donned a pair of grey sneakers as he carried a black backpack over his shoulders. 

After browsing inside the store, the father of four was seen pushing a cart full of groceries towards his car.

The actor has seen his fair share of headlines related to his personal life in recent months.

Back in May, Green confirmed his split from wife Megan Fox after 10 years of marriage during an episode of his podcast ...With Brian Austin Green. During his confession, he maintained that infidelity did not play a role in their separation and that he will alway have love for Megan.  

'I will always love her. And I know she will always love me and I know as far as a family what we have built is really cool and really special.'

Around that same time Fox was romantically linked with actor and musician Machine Gun Kelly, who reportedly got close while shooting the upcoming thriller film Midnight In The Switchgrass.

It's believed Green and Fox split at the end of 2019.

The former couple share three sons together -- Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four. Green also has a son Kassius, 18, that he shared with ex-fiancee Vanessa Marcil.
