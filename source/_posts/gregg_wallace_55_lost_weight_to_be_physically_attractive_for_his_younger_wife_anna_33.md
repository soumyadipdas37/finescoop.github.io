He met his wife on Twitter in 2013 and they tied the knot three years later.

And Gregg Wallace has admitted he believes losing weight is the best way to keeping sparks flying with his wife Anna, who is 21 years his junior. 

The Masterchef host, 55, revealed on Saturday that he transformed his lifestyle as he wants his wife, 33, to be 'physically attracted' to him after he became disillusioned with the idea of being the 'older and fatter' partner.

Gregg used to weigh 16 stone before embarking on a new exercise and healthy eating regime that allowed him to drop a whopping four stone. 

Now, he has a new lease of life and admits he feels better than ever before. 

He revealed to The Mirror: 'I’ve got more energy and stamina and I’m stronger and leaner than I was at 25.'

Aside from providing eye candy for his wife of three years, the Masterchef presenter received a big wake up call when he was informed he had dangerously high cholesterol. 

He enrolled the help of a personal trainer and now exercises for an hour, five days a week from his Kent farmhouse, as gyms remain closed. 

The TV presenter has also been getting his family on board as they have been enjoying walks around his local area.

His fitness journey inspired him to launch his own website showme.fit which helps others achieve a healthier lifestyle.

On the platform, Gregg shares tips from his own personal fitness journey alongside exercise routines with his personal trainer.

Since adopting his new lifestyle, Gregg revealed that he practices everything in moderation and still enjoys a pint of beer when he feels like it.

He said: 'When we slip up we tend to chuck it all in, but that’s not the way. You’re ­going to slip up. You’re going to go to the pub, drink too much and get a kebab on the way home.  

'There is no way I’m going through the week without a pint of beer. But I’m careful most of the time and here I am, as fit as a butcher’s dog.'

He also shunned dieting solutions such as the 5:2 fasting route, branding them 'uncomfortable' and 'not sustainable'.
