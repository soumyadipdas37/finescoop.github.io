Dancing with the Stars judge Tristan MacManus was announced as Sarah Harris' new co-host on Studio 10 last week.

And in a first-look trailer for the revamped morning talk show, the professional dancer's camaraderie with Sarah, 39, is evident.

In the clip, Sarah squeals with delight as she finds out Tristan, 38, has been chosen as her co-host, replacing departing panellists Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Natarsha Belling and Joe Hildebrand.

Without showing his face, the promo teases Tristan getting suited and booted as he makes his way through the halls of Channel 10's headquarters.

An unsuspecting Sarah is seen with the hair and makeup team before Tristan walks up from behind and says: 'Hello, Ms Harris!'

Turning around to see her new colleague, the blonde journalist lets out an excitable scream and rushes to hug him.

Proving they hit it off straight away, the Irish heartthrob shows off his dance moves as he twirls Sarah around.

Tristan is set to make his hotly anticipated debut on Studio 10 on Monday.

He said of his new role in a statement: 'Although people know me as a dancer, I think my mouth usually works better than my feet do.'

'This opportunity came out of the blue, and I'm really excited to be working with Sarah and learning from her,' the father of two added.

It comes after regular Studio 10 panellists Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were axed from the network last month due to budget cuts.

Tristan and Sarah will be joined by newsreader Narelda Jacobs, showbiz reporter Angela Bishop, and contributors Denise Drysdale, Jono Coleman and Craig Bennett.

On Thursday morning, Joe Hildebrand announced his resignation from the show.
