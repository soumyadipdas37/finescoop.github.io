She's turned her top modeling career into an equally successful one as a TV personality.

And on Monday, Heidi Klum showed she's still got 'it' as she posed for pictures in a dramatic pantsuit by Valentino.

The blonde beauty, 47, looked sensational in the black and white giraffe print outfit in snaps she shared on her Instagram.

The outfit had a crew neck with scarf and flared sleeves and trousers.

Heidi added a pair of white heels along with a gold ankle bracelet and gold chandelier earrings.

She wore her long hair up in a bouffant bun and was made up with black eye-liner and mascara with soft pink lip color.

She added a short video captioned 'Hurry up .....and wait !!!!!' and the images appeared to have been taken at a swanky outdoor eatery.

Heidi is currently serving as a judge on NBC's America's Got Talent after returning to the show following a brief hiatus.

When the reality show comes to an end, she will be heading to her native Germany this fall with her four children, whom she shares with ex-husband Seal.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the next season of her series Germany's next top Model can't film as usual in Los Angeles where Heidi lives, and so instead she is having to relocate to Berlin for three and a half months to film the show there.

No doubt also accompanying her will be husband Tom Kaulitz, a guitarist with German rock band Tokio Hotel.

She and Tom, 31, tied the knot in secret in February 2019 after starting to date in early 2018.
