Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo is set to be awarded his coaching badges on Monday, only six days before his first match against Sampdoria in Serie A.

Pirlo replaced Maurizio Sarri as Juve boss in August, signing a two-year deal with the Italian champions. It was just 10 days after he had been appointed as their Under 23s manager.

And, according to Football Italia, Pirlo will finally land his coaching badges on Monday when he presents a thesis followed by a verbal exam.

Usually, any potential manager has to already have their coaching badges before taking over at a professional club but an exemption for Pirlo had been made as he had already started the course when Juventus offered him the managerial vacancy.

His predecessor Sarri was sacked after their shock Champions League last-16 exit to Lyon, despite guiding Juve to their ninth straight Serie A title.

Pirlo, who played for Juve for four years from 2011, has underlined his desire to bring in a striker in time for the curtain-raising match on Sunday.

Speaking after a 5-0 friendly win over Novara, Pirlo said: 'Yes, I need a striker as soon as possible, but the transfer market is long and closes on October 5.'

Juventus have been linked with Luis Suarez, Moise Kean and Edin Dzeko.
