Australian actor Hugh Sheridan broke down in tears as he was released from hotel quarantine on Saturday.

The Packed To The Rafters star, 35, was very emotional as he reunited with his sister Zoe with a warm embrace.

Just one week after returning a false-positive test for the virus, Hugh wrapped his arms around his sibling as he wept happy tears.

On Friday, he revealed he had tested negative for COVID-19 after initially returning a positive test for the virus.

The actor explained the doctors told him on Thursday night his result was actually a 'false positive'.

The star described the whole ordeal as a 'rollercoaster of emotions' and incredibly confusing.

False alarm: On Friday, Hugh revealed he has now tested negative for COVID-19, after initially returning a positive test for the virus last week

The actor had previously revealed he had tested positive and that he'd somehow caught the deadly virus in transit from Los Angeles to Australia.

'I've been quiet for the last few days because I've been feeling all the varied emotions about my positive Covid test. I haven't felt like talking to anyone much yet,' he wrote.

Hugh had jetted into Australia from Los Angeles in mid-August, and at the time was forced to undergo a mandatory 14-day stint at a quarantine hotel.

'I had a negative result when I arrived [in Australia]. I now know all my friends including [those] who took me to LAX airport are all negative so it's been confusing for me. It's scary, frustrating and lonely,' he said. 

'I am SO LUCKY & I keep reminding myself to count each blessing 1 by 1. To everyone: this virus is seriously clever. Knowing now that no one I saw back home overseas has it means I got it in a very short space of time (in transit or a surface) while I had minimal human contact,' he wrote.  

At the time he admitted his mental health had suffered as a result of the diagnosis.
