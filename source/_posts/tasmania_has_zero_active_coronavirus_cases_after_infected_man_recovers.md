Tasmania, which has had 228 cases overall, has recorded just two cases in more than three months.

It had a four-week stretch of being COVID-19 free across June and July.

Tasmania's borders will stay shut until at least December because of the risks posed by outbreaks on the mainland.

Premier Peter Gutwein recently extended the state of emergency until the end of October.

Thirteen people have died from the virus.
