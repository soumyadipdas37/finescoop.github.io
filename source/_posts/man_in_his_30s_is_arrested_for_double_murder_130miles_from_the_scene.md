A man has today been arrested on suspicion of murder - 130 miles away from the scene of the double shooting.

The suspect was detained after a vehicle was stopped on Hunter Street in Carnforth, Lancs., at around 11.30am.

He is being transported back to the West Midlands area for questioning about killing the two men, who were aged in their late 20s or early 30s.

The victims have still not been formally identified and a post mortem examination is scheduled to take place tomorrow.

Detective Chief Inspector Jim Munro, from West Midlands Police's Homicide Unit, said: 'This is a fast moving investigation, a real team effort involving officers who've worked around the clock since the discovery of the bodies to trace the person we believe is responsible.

'The arrest is a significant development but our enquiries continue and I would appeal to anyone with information about what's happened, or anyone who was in the area at the time and saw or heard anything suspicious, to get in touch.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact police via Live Chat online or by calling 101 quoting log 3204 from Sept 30.
