Irina Shayk has been putting her modeling prowess on full display at Milan Fashion Week.

Among the many highlights of her eye-grabbing catwalks was when she hit the stage for the Versace Spring/Summer 2021 collection on Saturday in a number of busty gowns and corset designs.

And in-between one of her many fashionista strolls the Russian beauty showcased her ample cleavage in a selfie snap that she posted on Instagram.

In the photo, Shayk flashed a seductive grin decked out in an orange gown with corset design.

The number, which hugged her upper body, plunged just enough to allow a matching undergarment to stand out and give her perky assets an extra push.  

Her ensemble was rounded out having her dark brown tresses styled in a wet look that was pushed back behind her ears, with the exception of a few strands of hair.

When Shayk strutted her stuff in the gown, she had her wet-look locks pushed back over her ears with a part on the slight left.  

She also wore a pair of orange open-toe heels and an assortment of rings.

The Versace fashion show also saw Shayk showcasing her cleavage in a baby blue gown adorned with sparkling starfish.

Afterwards, stylist and fashion journalist Katie Eleanor Grand shared of photo of Shayk on her Instagram Story posing at a side angle wearing a large chain necklace over a dark blue shirt.
