Robin Wright showed off her trim figure in a pair of skintight jeans when she stepped out in Los Angeles this Wednesday.

The 54-year-old actress slipped into a T-shirt from RE/DONE which was co-founded by Alessandra Ambrosio's ex Jamie Mazur.

Sweeping her signature blonde hair up into a high ponytail, she accessorized with a sleek pair of sunglasses and pulled on some casual sneakers.

The sizzling sensation made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown amid the ongoing pandemic.

Robin's latest outing comes roughly two months after her ex-husband Sean Penn, 60, confirmed his marriage to Leila George, 28.

Leila's parents are both also in the acting profession - her mother Greta Scacchi is Sean's age and her father Vincent D'Onofrio is just one year older.

Robin and Sean were married from 1996 until 2010 and share two children who are right around Leila's age - daughter Dylan, 29, and son Hopper, 27.

Rumors circulated at the beginning of this August that Sean and Leila had secretly tied the knot after four years of dating.

News of the wedding spread when they received congratulations on Instagram from Josh Brolin, as well as from movie producer Mike Medavoy's wife Irena.

A few days later Sean went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and showed off his gold wedding band, confirming that he has married for a third time.

'We did a COVID wedding. By that I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom, and we were at the house,' Sean revealed.

'My two children and her brother, and we did it that way,' said Sean, who won an Academy Award in a biopic of Harvey Milk.

Robin's first husband was actor Dane Witherspoon and she is currently married to French fashion executive Clement Giraudet whom she wed in 2018.

Meanwhile before he took up with Robin, Sean had a highly publicized failed marriage to Madonna which lasted from 1985 until 1989.
