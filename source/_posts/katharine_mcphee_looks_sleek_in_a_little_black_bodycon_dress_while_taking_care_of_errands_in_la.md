Katharine McPhee added a touch of glamour to her usually stylish looks on Monday as she stepped out in Los Angeles in a little black dress.

The 36-year-old actress and singer was seen taking care of errands around the city while showing off her phenomenal figure in the tiny dress.

Katharine covered up her form-fitting dress with a more casual gray plaid blazer, which she appeared to have worn on Friday while enjoying a double date with her husband David Foster, 70, and Rebel Wilson, 40, and her partner.

Katharine's thigh-length dress showed off her fit legs, culminating in a pair of white platform sneakers.

She matched her dress with a black quilted handbag on a gold chain while also carrying a larger black bag.

The 5ft8in Smash star had her brunette tresses parted down the middle and cascading down her shoulders in gentle waves, and she blocked out the afternoon sun with a pair of round-frame sunglasses.

Katharine has been vigilant about wearing masks in public to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Monday was no exception as she had on a pale blue surgical-style mask.

The former American Idol star was on her own for the day without her husband David Foster. 

Katharine made headlines in August when sources claimed to Us Weekly that she hopes to have a child with her senior husband. 

The couple, who married in London in June 2019, are 'definitely trying' for a baby, the sources said. 

The potential child would be the singer's first and the songwriter's sixth, after Allison, 50, Amy, 47, Sara, 39, Erin, 37, and Jordan, 33.

Katharine's outing came shortly after she resumed filming on her upcoming Netflix series Country Comfort.

The actress shared a photo of a masked table read with the cast on Thursday, captioning it, 'and we're back!'

Another photo showed a monitor on set capturing her breaking into laughter with her costar Eddie Cibrian.

The two were announced to star in the series in January, but production was halted in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The multi-camera comedy was created by The Nanny's executive producer Caryn Lucas and shares a similar premise to the Fran Drescher series, though it's not a reboot.

Katharine plays a young country singer who takes up a job as a nanny after her singing career experiences a setback.

She starts working for a cowboy named Beau (Cibrian) who needs help raising his five children, but she soon finds a way to restart her music career after learning the whole family is musically gifted.

Netflix hasn't yet announced a release date for the comedy series.
