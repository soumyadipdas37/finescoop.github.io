They treated fans to a peek inside their blissful romance on Wednesday, when they shared a slew of loved-up snaps on Instagram.

And Brooklyn Beckham, 21, and his fiancée Nicola Peltz, 25, continued to look as loved up as ever later that day, when they stepped out for a stroll in New York City.

Donning face masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the lovebirds walked hand-in-hand as they meandered through the bustling streets of SoHo.

Brooklyn looked casually cool for the outing stepping out in a black ensemble that included a graphic T-shirt, fitted trousers and a baseball cap.

Contrasting his outfit with a pair of white Nike Air Force 1 trainers, the aspiring photographer stayed close to his wife-to-be, who also stepped out in all-black.

American actress Nicola appeared to have coordinated with her British beau, wearing a Balenciaga jacket with skinny jeans and chunky heavy duty boots.

With her golden locks falling beyond her shoulders, the screen star only had eyes for her future husband as they enjoyed their day out together. 

Hours earlier, the Nicola and Brooklyn – son of David and Victoria Beckham – posed for a slew of loved-up snaps, which were shared on Instagram.

Cuddling up close, the pair appeared completely smitten, with one intimate snap showing the pair fresh out of the shower. 

Nicola shared a black and white snap of the couple, where she could be seen draping her hands across Brooklyn as he sported a face full of shaving cream.

The pair were both wearing only towels, with Brooklyn offering a look at his extensive tattoo collection as he snapped the picture. 

Billionaire heiress Nicola captioned the shot, 'love you more everyday', to which Brooklyn gushed, 'I’m the luckiest boy in the world to have you by my side ❤️❤️'.

The pretty blonde then shared another cosy snap of the pair as she called Brooklyn her 'BFF'.   

On Monday, the newly-engaged couple looked smitten as they posed for a short video using the Dua Lipa Instagram filter.

The aspiring photographer planted a kiss on the actresses cheek as she pouted for the camera while psychedelic colours danced around them.

Nicola looked chic as her golden locks fell in loose waves over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion. 

Brooklyn, meanwhile, wore his brunet locks in a tousled style, while he looked loved-up as he gently caressed Nicola's cheek while kissing her.

Showing off their funny side, Nicola also showed her toes in the video as she moved her foot from one end of the frame to the other.

Last month, Brooklyn set tongues wagging when he showed off a gold band on his wedding finger, fuelling speculation they've married in secret.

Brooklyn took to Instagram in July to announce his engagement to Nicola following reports he had popped the question to his 'soulmate' after just eight months of dating.

Sharing a stunning snap of the couple, he wrote: 'Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me and she said yes xx

'I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day. I love you baby xx.'
