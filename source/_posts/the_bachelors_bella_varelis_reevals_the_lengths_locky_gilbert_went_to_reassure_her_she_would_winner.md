It has been two months since The Bachelor Locky Gilbert left her blindsided after dumping her for Irena Srbinovska.

And Bella Varelis has revealed that her break-up with the 31-year-old was even more shocking given the extreme lengths he went to assure her she would be the final woman standing.

From discussing engagement rings to telling her he 'couldn't wait to make her happy for the rest of her life', the 25-year-old lambasted Locky for gaslighting her during a new interview on the Life Uncut podcast.

'He gaslighted me!' The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has revealed that her break-up with Locky Gilbert was even more shocking given the extreme lengths he went to assure her she would be his winner

Speaking to Brittany Hockley and Laura Byrne, the brunette said: 'During lockdown, we were talking about engagement rings.

'He was like what, "would you do if I proposed to you at the end?"

'The one thing that really got me was when he said, "I can't wait to make you happy for the rest of your life". You don't just say that to someone unless you really want that to happen.'

Admitting that Locky's words had a significant effect on her, Bella continued: 'I remember saying to my mum, "I think I've actually found the person who wants to be with me".

The brunette said: 'During lockdown, we were talking about engagement rings. 'He was like what, "would you do if I proposed to you at the end?"

'From all the things I have been through, from my exes to somehow being connected to The Bachelor, this was obviously what it was all pointing too.

'I had to come in here, I had to meet Locky, and he's going to be the person that I wanted to be with,' Bella explained what she thought was going to happen.

Reflecting on her experience, Bella concluded: 'He essentially gaslighted me'.

This comes after a recent report from The Wash claimed that Locky 'texted her saying he couldn't wait to make her happy for the rest of her life and talked about engagement rings.'

The website quoted an anonymous source, who had been 'present for the majority of filming', as saying: 'Locky gave her a lot of reassurance that it was going to be her at the end.

He also allegedly texted the marketing consultant before filming their last goodbye to 'reassure her' she would be his winner - making his eventual decision all the more hurtful and bewildering for her.

Two months on from the finale, Locky is still smitten with Irena. She has packed up her life in Melbourne to live with the adventurer in Perth.
