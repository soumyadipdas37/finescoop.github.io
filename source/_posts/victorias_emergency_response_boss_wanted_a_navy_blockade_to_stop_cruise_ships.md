Victoria's emergency response boss wanted the Australian Defence Force to intervene to stop cruise ships from docking in Melbourne. 

Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp pushed to get a navy blockade to ensure cruise ships would not enter Port Phillip Bay.

The exchange was revealed during the state's inquiry into the botched hotel quarantine on Tuesday, where audio recordings of State Control Centre meetings were shown from March 27 and 28.

On March 27 Mr Crisp was told that two cruise ships were preparing to dock in Melbourne and reacted strongly, the Herald Sun reported.

'It's where we night need a bit more help from the ADF, we need a navy blockade so the ships can't get close to Victoria,' he said. 

An unnamed person said the ships were going to arrive at Station Pier in the coming days to resupply before then heading to the United States.

Mr Crisp dropped the issue after saying it was 'very useful' and the meetings continued to set up the mandatory 14-day quarantine period with less than 36 hours notice.

There was confusion in the State Control Meetings about whether state or commonwealth laws were going to be used to enforce the quarantine.

In a recording from March 28, Mr Crisp said: 'The control agency is the Department of Health and Human Services for this operation'.

However on Tuesday DHHS secretary Kym Peake claimed her department did not hold full responsibility.

Ms Peake also told the inquiry she did not know who decided to hire private security for the hotel quarantine. 

Andrew Crisp: Are we expecting cruise ships? I didn't think we were.

Claire Febey: While we have been on the call, I'm getting advice from team members who are looking into this (who) tell me that there are two cruise ships that want to refuel, restock and change crew … I need to get some more detail but I just think that's something we need to consider and plan for.

Mr Crisp: No, no, definitely, if that's possibly going to happen. It's where we might need a bit more help from the ADF, we need a Navy blockade so the ships can't get close to Victoria.

Unnamed: So there's two ships coming into Melbourne to Station Pier, one tomorrow morning and one Sunday morning. They're coming in purely to resupply with fuel, water and food. One of the ships is taking two US passengers on and they're heading out again. There is no change of crew, no one is getting off, it's simply just to refuel and go. And these are two of the ships that were off the coast of Western Australia. They have got American tourists on board, they can't fly and they have to travel by sea to get home to North America.

Mr Crisp: That's very useful. 



Premier Daniel Andrews has been slammed for his handling of the coronavirus crisis

Government officials were hesitant about hiring private security personnel to man the hotels because they thought it was an industry run by 'cowboys'.

They were also concerned about 'rogue' guards potentially 'prowling the corridors' of hotels, WhatsApp messages shown at the inquiry reveal.  

In spite of their concerns, private security firms did land the contracts, and up to 99 per cent of coronavirus cases in Victoria's second wave can now be traced back to returned travellers.

The virus escaped several hotels after security guards unknowingly contracted the virus and spread it throughout their communities. 

On Tuesday, the inquiry was shown several text messages between Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions staff on the evening of March 27.

'Gotta be careful with a lot of security companies. Heaps of cash work,' one bureaucrat warned.

'Cowboy industry,' another said.

'Needs to be reputable. Don't want (redacted) rogue (redacted) prowling the corridors,' another replied.

The inquiry is partially trying to decipher who made the final decision to hire private firms instead of utilising the services of the Australian Defence Force.

The inquiry is working through evidence to establish if and how the quarantine program failed Victorians.

Jobs department secretary Simon Phemister told the inquiry his department was tasked with hiring security companies following a meeting at the state control centre on March 27.

Mr Phemister wasn't present at the meeting but knew it was attended by high-ranking Victoria Police officers and Mr Crisp.

'I don't know who made the decision,' Mr Phemister told the inquiry on Tuesday.

'All I know is that we were commissioned to procure private security in that 4.30pm meeting.'

According to recordings of the meeting, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Grainger told Mr Crisp it was the force's preference that private security be the 'first line of security'.

Victoria Police have since argued they were expressing a preference, not a direction.

Mr Phemister said his department was looking for companies with a track record of working with the government plus the ability to 'scale up' as more travellers returned home.

It was also considered 'valuable' if a security company had its own personal protective equipment supplies due to a shortage in Victoria at the time.

'The final point... we needed them to be good, model employers,' he said.

'Now more than ever, given the economic climate, we needed people who had a track record of being good to their teams and employing people on a correct and fair basis.'

There are several more officials required to give evidence to the inquiry, which is now in its final week of public hearings.

Department of Health and Human Services secretary Kym Peake sppeared on Tuesday, while Jobs Minister Martin Pakula and Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville are both due to give evidence on Wednesday.

Health Minister Jenny Mikakos and Premier Daniel Andrews have been pushed back to Thursday and Friday respectively due to scheduling issues.

'When I'll appear before the inquiry I'll answer the questions as honestly, frankly, clearly, directly as possible,' the premier told reporters at his daily news conference on Tuesday.

The inquiry continues.
