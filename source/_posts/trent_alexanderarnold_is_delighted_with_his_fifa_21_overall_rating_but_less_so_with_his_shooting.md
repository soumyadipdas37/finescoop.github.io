Trent Alexander-Arnold was shown his new player ratings for the upcoming FIFA 21 gameÂ 

The full-back was happy with his high rating of 87 which places him in the top 50 players

The Premier League winner, who plays his fair share of the virtual football game, was pleased overall but took aim at one of the statistics he was handed.

'Yeah I'm happy, of course! 87. Wow, thats high!', Alexander-Arnold told Dan Walker as he was shown his ratings card on Football Focus.Â Â 

The Liverpool man was given a relatively low rating of 66 for his shooting despite showcasing his impressive ability in front of goal with three stunning free kicks in the Reds' title-winning campaign.

'Maybe they put that in there because it's my squad number' '(I scored) Four goals (last season) from full-back', Alexander-Arnold joked.

The 21-year-old thought his shooting score of 66 he was given should have been higherÂ 

'Maybe (the rating is harsh), I don't know! I'm not going to challenge it too much. I would have liked it to be higher though!'

The gifted full-back netted sweetly-struck dead ball goals twice against Chelsea and once against Crystal Palace, as well as a neat finish from distance against Leicester last term.Â 

Alexander-Arnold's Liverpool team-mates Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were all given ratings of 90 for the new game, placing them inside the top 10 players overall.

The game is set to be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows on October 9.Â
