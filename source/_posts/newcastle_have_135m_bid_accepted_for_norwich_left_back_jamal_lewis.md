Newcastle United have had a £13.5million bid accepted for Norwich City left back Jamal Lewis.

The 22-year old saw a move to Liverpool fall through earlier this summer and had interest from Crystal Palace and Leicester but is now expected to sign for Steve Bruce at Newcastle in a deal that will rise with add-ons.

Newcastle have put a deal in place for Brazilian Rogerio at Sassuolo but Bruce has been looking to add a stronger British contingent to his squad.

A fee of £12.5m was touted for the highly-rated left back, but Bruce has now changed tack in a bid to freshen up his squad before the new Premier League campaign. 

It is now firmly in Lewis' hands whether he becomes Newcastle's first signing for a fee in the current window.

The emphasis on British recruitment has also seen the club express interest in free agent Ryan Fraser and Bournemouth frontman Callum Wilson.

Fraser, who played alongside Wilson on the south coast before leaving as a free agent earlier this year, reportedly jetted up to Newcastle as the deal edges closer to completion.

The club are fearful that Aston Villa will beat them to the signing of Wilson, however. Sportsmail understands Bournemouth turned down an offer of £15m from the Midlands outfit, a bid that featured the full fee up front and did not include an add-ons.   

Bruce has already signed Republic of Ireland international Jeff Hendrick on a free transfer from Burnley last month, and goalkeeper Mark Gillespie on a free from Motherwell. 

He is also looking to strengthen his back-line with a move for Arsenal centre half Rob Holding. 

Newcastle are currently exploring the possibility of taking Holding on loan from the Emirates.
