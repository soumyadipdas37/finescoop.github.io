A vlogger who is known for creating funny videos has gone viral on social media after sharing a parenting tip that puts babies to sleep in under a minute.

Austin Miles Geter who lives in Texas, explained in a video posted on Facebook how he is able to get his four-month-old daughter Charlie to sleep with a tip that has been popular with previous generations. 

'I heard that if you gently rub their eyebrows, they will go to sleep,' he said, as he sat in a rocking chair and prepared to try the hack.

Boasting over 157,000 followers on Facebook, Austin explained that he has heard others recommend rubbing a baby's eyebrow to make them feel sleepy 

Austin who has more than 157,000 followers on his Facebook page in addition to almost 46,000 subscribers on YouTube, where he also shared the hack, explained that he could tell Charlie was sleepy before he started.

He said: 'Here we are. She keeps crying because I have to keep changing positions but I know she's sleepy.

'I heard if you gently rub their eyebrows, they'll go to sleep. So i'm going to try it.'

In the clip Austin is seen lightly rubbing a finger over Charlie's left eyebrow, as she fought to keep her eyes open.

Trying not to disturb her, the vlogger remained quiet until she silently drifted to sleep and held his fist up to celebrate the small victory.

Revealing they've used the tip professionally, another wrote: 'When I used to work at daycare, gently rubbing up and down between their eyebrows knocked them out.'
