A jealous killer has revealed the horrific reason he stabbed his ex-partner to death with a 35-centimetre long blade.

James Fredes knifed Erana Nahu in her back in her home in Glenfield in Western Sydney on October 11, 2018.

The former couple had split up after a 15-year relationship in 2013, but the mother-of-two invited Fredes to live in her spare room eight months before she was killed.

Ms Nahu had started a new relationship since their breakup, which shattered Fredes, who was seen crying in his room on October 9.

The following day Fredes made sexual advances towards the 43-year-old, which were rejected.

Furious, Fredes went to the kitchen, grabbed the knife and plunged it into her back.

He later told police he 'really needed' intimacy and was jealous of her new relationship. 

Justice Peter Hidden said the attack was borne out of 'jealousy and a sense of rejection'. 



Ms Nahu's cousin heard the commotion and rushed into the room to find she had been stabbed by Fredes under her right shoulder blade, causing a punctured lung.

Paramedics attempted to revive Ms Nahu but she died at the scene.

Fredes was arrested at the scene and told authorities he 'didn't mean for this to happen' and that Ms Nahu was 'my only friend'.

'I was thinking about the pain I was going through … She's going to feel some pain too, but I wasn't going to do it,' he said.

Fredes was sentenced to 17 years three months in prison with a non-parole period of 13 years.

'I accept his assertion that he did not intend to kill Ms Nahu, but by his plea of guilty he admits an intention, albeit formed spontaneously, to cause her really serious bodily injury,' Justice Hidden said.

'It is clear that he immediately regretted what he had done and sought to obtain medical assistance for Ms Nahu.

'The stabbing stands as an isolated incident in a long relationship in which there is no suggestion of any prior abuse by the offender, physical or emotional.' 

Fredes will be eligible for parole in October 2031.
