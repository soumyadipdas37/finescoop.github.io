Chris Evans has given his bank balance a massive boost as he has reportedly sold eight of his classic cars for a whopping £6.3million.

According to The Mirror, the Virgin Radio presenter, 54, who has a net worth of £50million, appointed liquidators to sell the swanky vehicles for him. 

Chris is said to have decided to close down one of the companies he uses for his car collection and, according to paperwork for Auto Holdings Limited, the host sold eight cars but didn't manage to sell four others worth £155,000.

The payday led to a VAT bill of £418,000 following the sales while he and his wife Natasha Shishmanian are said to have made £26million from car sales in just six years. 

In 2014, the former Radio 2 presenter sold some of his collection for £10million and made a further £10million in 2015 by auctioning off another 10 vehicles.

The publication reports that a 1966 Ferrari 275 GTB, a 1971 Ferrari Daytona Spyder and a 1964 Ferrari 250 GT/L Lusso were included in the sale, with those three cars alone worth a combined £5million.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Chris Evans for comment.

In April, Chris told how he 'thinks' he and his family had contracted COVID-19 the previous month after experiencing a 'really weird cold'.

Speaking on his Virgin Radio Breakfast Show, the broadcaster also admitted that he didn't self-isolate as none of his symptoms fell in line with the NHS-advised dry cough and high temperature that would warrant quarantining.

The star said – who has sons Noah, 10; Eli, eight, and 18-month-old twins Walt and Boo with his golfer wife Natasha, 40 – said: 'I think I've had it [coronavirus]. I'm not saying I'm qualified to say this though.

'So many of us had this really weird cold two or three weeks ago and if four out of five most prominent people on the telly talking about coronavirus, if they can get it – they're only mild symptoms, a bit of a sniffle and dry cough...' 

Explaining his reasons for not going into quarantine, he continued: 'I didn't get the fever or the dry cough, that's why I didn't self-isolate. Noah had the fever and he self-isolated before we all had to for 14 days. 

'But by that time, Tash had this cough and almost everybody you saw on telly reporting on the coronavirus looked red-faced and runny-eyed – I think lots of us have had it!' 

Chris made the revelation days after sharing that he'd transformed a boat at the bottom of his garden in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, into a makeshift radio studio in order to host his radio show.

Broadcasting veteran Chris was joined by a stripped back Virgin Radio crew for filming, putting on a cheery display in spite of the difficult circumstances.
