Elly and Becky Miles are looking for love side by side on the new season of The Bachelorette.

And on Monday, Elly, 25, and Becky, 30, were spotted working up a sweat at a Sydney gym after filming the Channel 10 dating show.

Documenting their visit on Instagram, the sisters couldn't wipe the smiles off their faces as they endured an intense workout together. 

'It's going to hurt!' Sisters Elly, 25, (right), and Becky Miles, (left) have returned to the gym for the first time in nine weeks after filming The Bachelorette in Sydney

'We're in town so we've come to visit... It's going to be our first session back in nine weeks so it's going to hurt, but I'm okay with it,' Elly told her followers upon arrival. 

'Pumped to be training back with the Air Locker fam. We missed the mountain!' Becky wrote alongside a photo of the pair posing with a boxing bag.

Showing off her toned physique, Elly looked fit in an all black ensemble which consisted of a black singlet top, matching leggings and black joggers.

'We're in town so we've come to visit... It's going to be our first session back in nine weeks so it's going to hurt, but I'm okay with it,' Elly told her followers upon arrival at the fitness centre

Becky was similarly dressed in activewear, however, she decided to wear a white singlet top instead.

Following their gym class, Elly joked: 'I saw the light a couple of times there,' but explained it was the 'best feeling ever' being back.

And if Monday's new trailer of The Bachelorette is anything to go by, it's clear there are early contenders for their hearts.  

Elly and Becky started by saying how delighted they are to be on their quest for Mr Right together. 

'I want to find love next to you. It will be magical,' Becky tells her sister, who beams as she agrees.

The Bachelorette is coming soon to Channel Ten
