Jo 'Foxy Jojo' McPharlin's season of Married At First Sight just aired for the first time in the UK.

And with the season just ending over there, the 42-year-old reflected on her experience - and appeared to take a swipe at ex 'husband' Sean Donnelly.

'What a fantastic experience even though the groom would think differently lol,' she wrote on Instagram.

'I wouldn’t have change it for the world as I have totally made life long friendships out of the show,' she continued.

'MAFS has taught me one thing, never try to convince somebody of your worth. If a person doesn’t appreciate you they do not deserve you. Love yourself and always listen to your gut instinct because it’s always right.'

The bawdy blonde was memorably rejected by Sean on Married At First Sight after he failed to feel chemistry with her on their wedding day.

Jo's been on an incredible weight loss journey since starring on MAFS more than two years ago.

Last month, she looked completely unrecognisable as she flaunted her trim figure in a stylish outfit.

The image sent her fans into a frenzy, with one commenting: 'Wowwwww, You look so beautiful.'

Another wrote: 'Jo you look more and more stunning every time you post a pic. How do you do it hun? Love this outfit.'

Just one week earlier, Jo went even further by stripping down to a racy red crop top that bared her flat stomach.

In a series of posts, the former MAFS star excitedly showed off her incredible weight loss. 

'That one moment you take a glimpse of yourself in the mirror and you love what you see,' she captioned a side-on photo of herself, adding the hashtags, '#lifegoals #loveyourself'.

A second photo showed Jo proudly standing face-forward in front of the mirror, a hand confidently placed on one hip.

'I'm absolutely loving my body transformation. #sogreatful [sic] #bodypositive,' she captioned the photo.

Jo also tagged All Covered Beauty in her post, thanking them for assisting her with her transformation.

According to their Instagram bio, they specialise in MM Slim, a magnetic muscle stimulator, which assists with muscle gain, fat loss and body shaping. 

In a post on Instagram in April, Jo spoke about her weight loss, crediting a ketogenic diet and strict exercise regimen with helping her to drop the kilos.

She revealed she had lost over 20 kilos.

'I don't give a toss about what people think I look like, I am just me. Love me or hate me, I'm just me,' she said at the time.

'I have been dedicated, strict and everything mentally I wanted to be. That's how I'm achieving my goals.

'No surgery, no major story to it. It's been bloody hard work, mentally and emotionally.'

'Body positive!' The star has been showing off her incredible slim down on social media over the last few months. (Pictured in July)

Jo said she was motivated by her children to change her lifestyle, and revealed she walks for 90 minutes a day.

'Every single day I want a certain food, but I look at my two beautiful children and I want a better quality of life for everybody,' she explained.

'I've stopped junk food, all of my carbs and the majority of alcohol. It's a lifestyle change. I've been blessed with losing weight, but maintaining it is the hard part.'

She added: 'I was my own worst enemy. When I stopped and looked in the mirror, I mean really looked in the mirror, and said, "stop being so harsh on yourself, you are gorgeous inside and out", that was the day that changed my life forever.'
