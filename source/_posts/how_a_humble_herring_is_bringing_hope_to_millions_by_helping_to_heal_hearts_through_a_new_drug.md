A new drug derived from a herring found in the South Pacific unblocks coronary arteries &ndash; bringing hope to millions of people with serious heart disease.
It is the first time a drug has been shown to turn back the physiological clock rather than slowing the furring of arteries.
Fresh data being presented at the European Society of Cardiology&rsquo;s virtual meeting this weekend reveals that the arteries of those given a twice-daily capsule of Vascepa &ndash; a type of highly purified omega-3 fatty acid &ndash; became progressively clearer over time.

Dr Craig Granowitz, chief medical officer of the drug&rsquo;s manufacturer Amarin Corporation, said it was sourced from a species of herring fished off the coasts of Chile and Argentina.&nbsp;
He said the same results could not be obtained from taking omega-3 food supplements.
Scans showed the volume of unstable plaque in two major coronary arteries of 80 volunteers on Vascepa fell by an average of 17 per cent over an 18-month period.&nbsp;

In those given placebo pills, the volume more than doubled.&nbsp;
Dr Granowitz said &lsquo;A cardiovascular event is a plumbing problem a piece of junk gets stuck in your [arterial] pipe. The key [to good cardiovascular health] is good flow.&rsquo;
Vascepa was approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration last December and is now awaiting approval from Euro-pean authorities.
