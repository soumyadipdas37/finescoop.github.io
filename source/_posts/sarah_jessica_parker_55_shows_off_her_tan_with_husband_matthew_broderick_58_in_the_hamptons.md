Sarah Jessica Parker appeared in high spirits as indulged in a relaxing getaway in the Hamptons on Friday. 

While getting away from their home in New York City, the four-time Golden Globe showed off her stunning figure at the beach with husband Matthew Broderick.  

The couple, who have multiple city townhouses in both Manhattan and Brooklyn, also have a beach house upstate where they frequently go on the weekends.

As she strutted around the shore, the Sex and the City alum showcased her envy-inducing tan and toned body in a black one-piece, while basking in the sun. 

Parker accessorized her classic swimsuit with a pair of black chunky wraparound sunglasses and an eye-catching silver pendant necklace. 

 Broderick, 58, showed off a muscled dad bod in a grey t-shirt and mint green board shorts, which were emblazoned with a dotted pattern.

As she looked out into the ocean, she looked to be monitoring that her children were not swimming too far out. 

At one point she put her hand on her head and looked stressed, before getting up and appearing to call out into the distance. 

Then, the doting mom returned to her spot in the sand, alongside her small group, who were also sitting under an umbrella.
