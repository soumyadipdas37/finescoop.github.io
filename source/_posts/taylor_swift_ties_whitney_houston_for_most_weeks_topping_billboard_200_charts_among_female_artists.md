It turns out the prolific singer-songwriter's record label Republic Records didn't even know about it until right before it was released. 

Swift recently released a deluxe version of the album featuring the bonus track The Lakes. 

Written and recorded while in isolation due to COVID-19, Swift collaborated on 11 of the 16 new songs on the hit album with multi-instrumentalist Aaron Dessner of the indie rock band The National.
