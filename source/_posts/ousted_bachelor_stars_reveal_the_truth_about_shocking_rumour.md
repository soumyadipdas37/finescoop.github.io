The Bachelor's Areeba Emmanuel and Laura Calleri have shared their thoughts on a shocking rumour about some behind-the-scenes behaviour on the show.

Appearing on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday, the pair addressed claims that Juliette Herrera 'left her dirty underwear hanging above Rosemary Sawtell's bed for a week'.

'I don't think that's true,' Areeba stated, before adding: 'I don't know anything about it and I don't believe it's true'.

Laura indicated that there may be some truth to the rumours, but explained that it may have been exaggerated. 

'I did hear about the dirty undies but I think it was definitely taken out of context,'she said.

'We had queues for the washing machine so we all had our own bags and stuff so I think it was probably taken out of context.'

'I don't think that's true,' Areeba Emmanuel stated on Thursday, before adding: 'I don't know anything about it and I don't believe it's true'

The rumours originated on the So Dramatic podcast last week.

In an episode of the show, host Megan Pustetto claimed that Juliette had caused friction in the mansion by hanging her 'dirty underwear' over Rosemary's bed for a week.

Rosemary recently denied claims that she asked producers to leave The Bachelor mansion because Juliette was 'making her feel uncomfortable'.

The 23-year-old has revealed she was 'heavily invested in her relationship' with Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert, and was sent home because she didn't receive a rose.

'No, I wasn't asking to leave the mansion. I was heavily invested and got those feels for Locky,' she said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia.

'I was like "I've done a cool rap, this will take me to next week, he's the love of my life, every chat we have is really good",' she continued.

She added: 'I guess now, looking back at the situation, maybe he knew he didn't have feelings for me and did me a kind service by not leading me on anymore.

'He knew that I'd never had a boyfriend or had much dating experience so I think he actually did a kind thing by letting me go at that point.'

Her statement comes after The Wash claimed Rosemary had a meltdown and told producers she wanted to leave the show before the rose ceremony was filmed.
