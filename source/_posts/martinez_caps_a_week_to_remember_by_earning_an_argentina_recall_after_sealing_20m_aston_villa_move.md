Aston Villa new boy Emiliano Martinez has received an Argentina recall to cap a week to remember.

In the week Martinez completed his £20m move to Villa from Arsenal, he has been rewarded for his displays for Mikel Arteta's side with selection for Argentina's World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Bolivia next month, his first call-up since last November.

Martinez, 28, deputised brilliantly for the injured Bernd Leno after lockdown last season to help Arsenal win last season's FA Cup and then this season's Community Shield.

He was hoping his performances would be enough to secure him more regular football at the Emirates.

But with Arteta unable to offer any guarantees Martinez decided the time had come to move on after 11 years at Arsenal, in part to boost his international hopes.

He has played for Argentina at under-17 and under-20 level though is yet to make his senior international debut despite his first call-up coming back in 2011 and further inclusions last year.

After Martinez started the Community Shield, Arteta opted for the fit-again Leno to start Arsenal's Premier League opener against Fulham with the former left out of the squad in order to complete his move to Villa.

Asked if the goalkeeping decision was one of the toughest he has had of his fledgling managerial career, Arteta said: 'Well, there's been many challenges since I joined the club!

'Obviously that one was tough but before that, as you can imagine, there were some conversations in the background about things developing in one way.

'So I knew what was going to happen with Emi. I had many discussions with him and I think we all finished in really good terms and we decided that Bernd was going to be the starter.

'I was very clear with both of them that it wasn't a No. 1 and a No. 2 and that they had to compete for the place like any other position in the team.

'Bernd was superb before he got injured at Brighton and Emi was absolutely excellent with all of the games that he played and how much he helped us as well with winning the trophies.

'But at the end of the day, that created a big competition, some big expectations from both of them and we had to deal with that.

'We were really open, trying to have those discussions and at the end, Emi had a really good offer, really well-suited to what he wants to achieve long-term and short-term and we allowed him to leave the club.

'With the departure of Emi, which is a big loss and someone that I think we all wish the best to for what he has done for the football club as well as the person that he is.

'We can see Emi being successful at Villa and we are all happy for him.' 

Tottenham duo Juan Foyth and Giovani Lo Celso, Manchester City's Nicolas Otamendi and Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister were also named in Lionel Scaloni's preliminary 30-man party.
