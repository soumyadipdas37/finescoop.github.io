West Ham's £27million bid for James Tarkowski has been rejected by Burnley.

The Turf Moor club were open to selling the England international at the right price but not at the figure offered by West Ham.

West Ham manager David Moyes is now waiting to see whether a revised bid can be mounted or begin to turn to alternatives.

Hammers boss David Moyes is keen to add Tarkowski but will need to increase his offer 

Moyes had been encouraged that Tarkowski was willing to make the move with the 27-year-old interested in playing a key role in the Scot's plans. However, their offer has been dismissed.

Earlier today, Burnley boss Sean Dyche indicated Tarkowski could be sold if his valuation is met.

'Do players have a price at any club? Yes, we’ve seen that across the whole of football,' Dyche said. 'Eventually a day comes if someone’s going to hit a certain number then all clubs, not just Burnley Football Club, have to make a decision.

'If that comes then the chairman will make that decision. [But] we’re not in the business of getting rid of our best players on the cheap, that’s for sure. In a healthy way, we’ve had speculation on our players since the first year I was here.

'Back in the day, it was Danny Ings then Trips (Kieran Trippier) and more latterly, your Michael Keanes and your Andre Grays. It’s not new to us. The club is in a very, very strong position so there’s no overwhelming desire to be selling players.'

Moyes reluctantly allowed Grady Diangana to be sold to West Brom last week for up to £18m to help raise funds. The move by the club's board prompted an angry backlash from players and fans. 

However, with a dearth of offers for other players, the decision was made to sacrifice Diangana to help strengthen their defence.

The bid for Tarkowski is understood to have been £20m plus add-ons. Moyes also wants two full-backs but see central defence as his priority.
