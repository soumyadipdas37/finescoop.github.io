Katie Price was spotted heading to a London studio on Wednesday, as she recorded new tracks in a bid to relaunch her music career.

The glamour model, 42, got a helping hand from her boyfriend Carl Woods as he pushed her along in a wheelchair, a requirement since she broke her feet in an accident while on holiday in Turkey over the summer.

Mother-of-five Katie appeared to be in an upbeat mood as she prepared for her day or recording inside the Soho building.

Once inside the studio, Katie was seen singing away as she stood in a recording booth.

In May of last year, Katie was seen showing off her vocal talents during a raucous appearance at the G-A-Y Porn Idol night at Heaven nightclub in London.

There she sang a version of A Whole New World, which she first dueted with her ex husband Peter Andre in 2006. 

Over the years, Katie has made several bids to top the charts, with the most recent being a track named I Got U, which she released in 2017.

Katie even debuted the track during a Loose Women appearance which received mixed reviews from fans.

In 2005, Katie also vied for a place in the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest while sporting a pink PVC catsuit while pregnant.

In 2009, an unedited version of Katie and Peter's version of a Whole New World was leaked, showing Katie's vocals without auto-tune.

Before this she released club anthem Free To Love Again, which hit the charts in 2010 and also performed duets with her ex husband Peter.

Meanwhile, Katie recently hit back at wheelchair users who criticised her for voicing concerns over her boyfriend Carl Woods fancying her while she is in a wheelchair - as she hit back saying: 'I'm allowed to be insecure'. 

Katie was opting for comfort for the outing as she donned a white tee and leggings and zipped along with her youngest kids, who she shares with Kieran Hayler.

The star is mother to Harvey, 18, with ex Dwight Yorke, Junior, 15, and Princess, 13, with former husband Peter Andre, and Jett, seven, and Bunny, six with Kieran Hayler.

Katie has been dating Carl for a matter of months but has frequently professed her love for the hunk, who had a fleeting appearance on the ITV2 show.

Club anthem: Before this, she released club anthem Free To Love Again, which hit the charts in 2010 and also performed duets with her ex husband Peter

After voicing her concerns over the passion in their romance and her mobility issues, Katie has now revealed she has received backlash. 

She told New! Magazine: 'I've had a lot of abuse from people in wheelchairs because I said I felt like Carl wouldn't fancy me in a wheelchair. 

'I'm not saying people who are in wheelchairs shouldn't be fancied. I'm saying, I'm in a new relationship and he met me how I was before so why should he fancy me like this? I'm allowed to feel insecure!'

Her chat comes after she was left 'horrified' after her 'mucky mansion' caught fire on Monday night - after a blaze caused by candles damaged the same property in 2018. 

Music career: It had long been rumoured for that Katie had planned to revive her music career

The fire brigade were called to the  former glamour model's house in West Sussex after neighbours raised the alarm.

The side of the £1.3 million home appeared to go up in flames after a caretaker built a bonfire right next to the side of her property, reports The Sun.     

The mother-of-five is currently living in a rented £4,250 per month six-bedroom property in Surrey, just minutes away from ex-husband Peter Andre's home while her dilapidated 'mucky mansion' is renovated 

A source told the publication: 'Katie was horrified when she was called about the fire - apparently the caretaker built a huge fire right next to the house, and when it went up the side of the house was covered in flames.

'It was a huge fire - a neighbour called the fire brigade thinking the house was burning down. It was put out in the end but you could see the smoke billowing across the road. She says the house is cursed.'
