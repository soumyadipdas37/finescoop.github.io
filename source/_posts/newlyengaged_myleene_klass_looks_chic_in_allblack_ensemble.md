Her outing comes after last week she revealed she has got engaged to her boyfriend Simon Motson. 

She admitted she was shocked when her partner, 45, popped the question last month on the fifth anniversary of their first date.

Speaking to Hello! magazine, Myleene told how Simon got down on one knee in their garden shed which he made into a replica of where they had their first date and surprised her with a nine-carat diamond ring.

She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.

'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: "Oh my God, he's for real." I was completely speechless.'

Simon added: 'It's quite a blur but I think I said something along the lines of: 'Myleene Angela Klass, will you marry me?' And I had to say it again... and I think I said it a third time. Finally she said yes and we were both in tears.'

The PR man spared no expense for the proposal, even borrowing the table and chairs they used at Little House private members' club in Mayfair.  

Ever the romantic, Myleene told how Simon also decorated the shed walls with framed photos and filled their garden with fairy lights. 

The couple's engagement has delighted Myleene's daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, who have been determined to see the couple walk down the aisle while Simon's children, a 13-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, are also thrilled. 

Myleene and Simon began dating in 2015 after she split from husband Graham Quinn in 2012, and they welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.
