The 28-year-old Rainy Day In New York star shared a screenshot of her message to Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, in her Instagram Stories.

'It's been a while since we sat down,' she began, before noting, 'We have a serious problem.

'@facebook and @instagram are being used to spread hate, misinformation, racism, and bigotry. I am calling on you both to HELP STOP THIS,' she continued.

The Spring Breakers star called on Zuckerberg and Sandberg to 'shut down groups and users focused on spreading hate speech, violence and misinformation.'

She was particularly concerned about misinformation as millions of Americans have already cast their ballots in the upcoming election. 

'Our future depends on it. This is an election year. We cannot afford to have misinformation about voting. There has to be fact checking and accountability. Hope to hear back from you ASAP,' she concluded.

Selena's shared her message with her 193 million Instagram followers after other celebrities stopped posting on Wednesday on Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.

Celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lawrence and Naomi Campbell all temporarily froze their accounts and shared the hashtag #StopHateForProfit.

'Facebook ignores hate & disinformation on their site,' wrote Jennifer Lawrence on Twitter. 'This is not an "operational mistake." It is a deliberate decision to put profits over people and democracy.'

In a lighter moment from Tuesday, the Lose You To Love Me singer did her best to show off the dance moves from the K-pop group Blackpink's Ice Cream music video.

Despite being featured on the song, she seemed to have a tough time recreating the choreography.

'I don't know,' she shrugged after going through the moves in a TikTok video.

True to form, the voting advocate performed her dance while wearing a white T-shirt reading 'Vote,' even if it was often obscured by her long locks.
