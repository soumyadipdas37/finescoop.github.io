Pierre Gasly wrote the tale of the unexpected by winning a topsy-turvy Italian Grand Prix.

The Frenchman emerged from the eventful race that had about every spill and trill motor racing has to offer – including a red flag – to take the top step of the podium for AlphaTauri.

The Rouen-born driver was dumped by Red Bull last season, his belief shot, but here he pulled off the biggest moment of his career aged 24, hanging on to beat the pursuing McLaren of Carlos Sainz, who drove quite beautifully all afternoon in the fan-free royal park. Lance Stroll, of Racing Point, was third.

As for pole-man Lewis Hamilton, he was victim of a stop-gap penalty for entering the pit lane when it was closed following Kevin Magnussen's Haas conking down early in the piece.

Soon Charles Leclerc had a major shunt. The Ferrari man lost control at the Parabolica, prompting a 27-minute delay in racing. He walked out unharmed despite hitting the tyre wall hard at one of the sport's fastest corners.

Hamilton's mistake caught up with him at about this point. He learned of his punishment as proceedings were halted.

The race restarted. Hamilton was leading but peeled in the following lap to swerve the sanction. It plunged him 30sec off the lead. He fought his way up, passing eight cars to finish seventh and also took the fastest lap. He was helped in the championship fight by Max Verstappen, of Red Bull, retiring and the other Mercedes, of Valtteri Bottas, finishing a limp fifth.

Canadian Stroll had begun the restart second to Hamilton but he lost his nerve and ran off, his chance of glory gone.

Gasly, who was third as racing began again on lap 28 of the 53, was up into first place, which he never relinquished, finishing 0.4sec ahead of Sainz. 'I just needed one more lap,' said the Spaniard. That was about right.

Lando Norris, in the other McLaren, finished fourth.

It was a nightmare for Ferrari. In addition to Leclerc's shunt, Sebastian Vettel retired with a brake fault.

Galsy screamed his delight over the radio and cried.

Alright, who had this guy down to win. 👏👏What a day for @PierreGASLY, @AlphaTauriF1 and F1. pic.twitter.com/L9op7BMge5

'I've been through so many things in the last 18 months and it's better than anything I expected. We focused day-by-day, they gave me my first podium in F1 in Brazil last year and now they've given me my first win. I don't know what to say, it's unbelievable. 

'I'm not someone that gives up. I've always had to fight for everything I've wanted in life and that's still the case. My drive to be better and stronger is still so strong. I knew if Sainz got past me I would have been so sad. I literally gave everything I had. The last five laps were so difficult.

'I almost shanked it like five times it was so hard but we got the win and it's amazing. Most of the team is Italian and we are in Italy, I know it's going to be a great time tonight.'

Alpha Tauri team principal Franz Tost hopes Gasly will stay with the team 'for a very long time' and has spoken glowingly about the young Frenchman since his return from Red Bull.

No celebrations for the chief, he's off to a meeting!

Respect 🤝@LewisHamilton x @PierreGASLY #SkyF1 | #F1 | #ItalianGP 🇮🇹 pic.twitter.com/1d7t2BOy5L

'Firstly I need to say a huge congratulations to Piere. Fantastic result for him. I've seen what he's been through. Dropped from a top team, then beats the top team.

'My race wasn't meant to be today. It was a bit unfortunate. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It was a long pit stop! But once I finally caught everybody I enjoyed that battle, Yeah, onto the next one.' 

[Interview pauses as Hamilton hugs Pierre Gasly]

'We didn't do a great job with the pit stop. I honestly didn't see those boards but I take responsibility for that. To get 7th and fastest lap is a positive, I will definitely take it. Max didn't score any points, so not a huge loss today.'

The French national anthem is being played out for the race winner, who stands atop the podium with Sainz and Stroll either side of him. The Italian national anthem rings out after Alpha Tauri's win.

Gasly is handed his winner's trophy, while the Alpha Tauri team manager collects a prize for the team-s huge win today. 

The champagne is out and the young drivers bask in the glory of their unexpected success, with red, white and green confetti flowing on stage. 

'Honestly it's unbelievable I'm not realising what's happening right now. It was such a crazy race.

'We capitalized on the red flag. We had a quick car behind us. I have been through so much in the last 18 months. My first win in Formula One with Monza, it's crazy. I've got no words.

'This team have done so much for me in F1. It's crazy, honestly, I am so happy, I can't thank them enough. It's a power-sensitive track and we beat Mercedes, Red Bull, Renault.

'I never expected it would happen to us but we kept focusing on ourselves since last yeaer, improving step-by-step. I am just so happy.' 

'It's incredible that I'm halfway disappointed with P2. I never thought we'd have a chance to win the race today.

'I think I would hav e got P2 behind Lewis if the race continued normally. Very happy with P2 we have been super quick all week and I felt I could dominate the midfield today. We need to be proud of the pace of the car. 

'It's been a couple years since I stood on a podium. Feels good to be back. It was a crazy race.

'I'm so happy for Pierre. He stayed consistent all the way throughout the race. It's a bit of a bummer cos it felt like mine to lose but I had a tonne of wheel spin and had a bad restart. I feel the win slipped away from us today but we'll take third place.' 

1. Gasly

2. Sainz

3. Stroll

4. Norris

5. Bottas

6. Ricciardo

7. Hamilton

8. Ocon

9. Kvyat

10. Perez

It's pandemonium down in the pit lane among the Alpha Tauri crew as Pierre Gasly parks up his car in front of the P1 sign. This is so wonderful to see, and great for Formula One in what has been a very dominant season for Lewis Hamilton.

Charles Leclerc, who retired earlier in the race, is out to congratulate Gasly. 

'So close but yet so far. One more lap, I needed one more lap'.

Sainz tried with all his might but Pierre Gasly kept his cool to clinch his first ever win in Formula One. 

He is the first new winner in F1 since Charles Leclerc last year.

'OH MY GOD!! WHAT DID WE JUST DO?! DID WE WIN THE F****** RACE?! WE DID IT AGAIN!!!'

Gasly is so emotional over the team radio as the Alpha Tauri team celebrate rapturously in the pits. An historic win for the Italian team at their home venue. 

LAP 53/53: Final lap. Sainz is under a second behind Gasly and is within DRS range. He's very close but will he be close enough? Hamilton is up to 7th place.

LAP 52/53: Sainz expresses his frustrations over the radio. McLaren tell him to be clinical and don't let his 2nd place slip. 'I want this win, Tom,' the Spaniard responds. 

LAP 51/53: Three laps to go. Gasly and Sainz have been told they have got battery power in reserve to defend/attack respectively. These young drivers are performing superbly.

Gasly has had a tumultuous time of it after being dumped by Red Bull, this will be a perfect response if he can hold on.

Hamilton has got past Daniil Kvyat and is into 8th. He's 11 seconds behind Bottas having lost 30 seconds with that stop-go penalty.

LAP 50/53: Sainz is getting so close to being within DRS range to strike on Gasly. He's 1.5 seconds behind the Frenchman. 

LAP 49/53: Bottas is falling away from Norris and has Ricciardo on his tail. Hamilton has cleared Perez's Racing Point and is up to 9th. He's running out of laps to get himself to that projected 6th place.

Five laps to go in Monza.

LAP 47/53: Hamilton has had clear air to drive into for the majority of the race restart but as he enters the midfield it may be more tricky for the six-time world champion. 

LAP 46/53: Carlos Sainz fancies being the first McLaren race winner since Jenson Button in Brazil in 2012. He is 1.5 seconds behind Gasly.

News from Red Bull: The team spotted a problem with Verstappen's engine and decided to pit him before it failed completely.

Hamilton is up into the points after overtaking Raikkonen.

LAP 45/53: The gap between Gasly and Sainz is just two seconds with eight laps remaining at Monza. Hamilton has just overtaken Latifi and is just outside the points with Sergio Perez under a second in front. 

LAP 44/53: This could be a sensational day for Alpha Tauri. The Italian team play second fiddle to Ferrari but Gasly is currently 1st and Kvyat has just overtaken Raikkonen for 8th. 

Bottas is closing in on Lando Norris now, and has DRS behind him. 

LAP 43/53: Raikkonen is down to 8th with Renault's Ocon getting past the Alpha Romeo. Hamilton has just passed Grosjean for 12th while Sainz is around 2.2 seconds behind Gasly, with Stroll 2.5 seconds behind the McLaren.

LAP 42/53: Carlos Sainz is within three seconds of Pierre Gasly in first as Hamilton passes Russell into 13th. 

Hamilton's predicament should have been perfect for Bottas' championship hopes, but if the Brit races perfectly now, he could overtake his team-mate in what would be very embarrassing for the Finn

LAP 40/53: Hamilton looks to close the gap on Albon and gets past the Thai-British driver after he locked up and had to take an emergency exit corner. Just ahead of him, George Russell and Romain Groshean are doing battle for 12th. 

LAP 39/53: Hamilton has been told to pull out of the slipstream, with the Mercedes struggling again with overheating problems. That's not going to help much as he looks to climb the field. 

LAP 38/53: Raikkonen is falling backwards alarmingly quickly, Ricciardo is next to get past the Finn. Hamilton remains in 15th, but is closing in on Alex Albon, under a second behind the Red Bull. 

LAP 37/53: Raikkonen is falling down the pack now, with compatriot Bottas getting past the Alpha Romeo and moves up to 5th. Sky Sports predict that Sainz could be within striking distance of Gasly in just eight laps. 

LAP 36/53: Mercedes are confident Hamilton can finish as high as P6, which would be a fantastic result with 17 laps to go. Bottas is currently occupying 6th, and is having a torrid time this afternoon.

Sainz has a four-second gap to close on Gasly, and is currently six-tenths of a second quicker per lap than the Alpha Tauri. 

LAP 35/53: This could well be a straight shootout between former Red Bull driver Gasly and Ferrari's next driver Sainz. But hang on, Lance Stroll has got past Raikkonen and is back up to third after his awful restart to the race.

LAP 34/53: BIG MOVE from Carlos Sainz! McLaren tell the Spaniard to stay patient as he approaches Raikkonen but he says no chance, I'm going for the win and squeezes the Finn around the first corner and is up to 2nd. 

LAP 33/53: Hamilton posts the fastest lap with a 1:22.901. He won't pick up the bonus point if he doesn't make the top ten. How quickly can he reach the points? He's cut his 29-second gap to Gasly to 25-seconds.

LAP 32/53: Gasly currently has a two-second lead over Raikkonen, while Sainz has moved up to third following Giovinazzi's penalty.

Verstappen is retiring! He was all the way down in 14th and he's been hit by mechanical problems and has retired from the race. 

His run of six-consecutive podiums comes to an end here in Monza. 

LAP 30/53: Hamilton has it all to do and says his 23-second gap to the pack is 'bulls***' over the team radio. And it's all to play for among the rest of the field. Bottas is down in 7th, while Verstappen is in 14th. The Red Bull driver has been cleared following an incident between himself and Sergio Perez at Turn One.

Giovinazzi is in to serve his penalty now. 

LAP 29/53: Hamilton is in the pits and is serving his stop-go penalty. The top three as it stands is:

1. Gasly

2. Raikkonen

3. Giovinazzi

The Brit returns at the back of the pack and is 23 seconds behind Alex Albon in 16th. He's got time but needs to get a move on to climb the field. 

LAP 28/53: It's a strong start for Hamilton but a terrible start for Lance Stroll, who is overtaken by Pierre Gasly and the Canadian runs off track with what looks like a brake problem but he returns to the action safely. 

We're back under way for what is essentially Part Two of the Italian Grand Prix. A reminder that Hamilton must take his stop-go penalty in the next three laps. 

It's all up for grabs now in what has been far from a conventional Grand Prix. 

That crash barrier is restored and action is set to resume at Monza. The cars are doing a formation lap and we're going to have a standing start on the grid to kickstart the action again. 

The last race that no driver from Mercedes, Red Bull or Ferrari made the podium was in Hungary in 2012. The last time no driver from each team won a race was Australia in 2013, when Kimi Raikkonen won. 

Hamilton will be taking the penalty immediately. When he does so, Stroll, Gasly and Raikkonen will occupy the top three places.

It was smooth sailing for Hamilton but this pit stop has changed the whole complexion of the race. Sky Sports replays show that red lights were clearly displayed along parabolica as Hamilton pitted.

Five minutes until the race resumes.

The race will resume in ten minutes.

Hamilton, Toto Wolff and Mercedes de-brief that red light incident.

This could well be Lance Stroll's race to lose now. The Canadian is second behind Hamilton, but once the championship leader serves his penalty the youngster will take the lead. 

It looks like Hamilton has been to see the race stewards to argue his case, to no avail it seems. 

This is the first red flag in the F1 since Azerbaijan in 2017, and the first red flag at Monza since 1995. 

With Hamilton being handed that hefty penalty, we could be in line to see an unusual winner here this afternoon.

Leclerc's Ferrari is crawling back into the pits as reparations of the crash barrier at the parabolica continue. 

It's all go here. Lando Norris is now being investigated for driving unnecessarily slowly into the pits! 

Hamilton is out of his car and is taking his scooter for a ride down the pit lane. 

Lewis Hamilton has been handed a 10-second stop-go penalty for illegally pitting. That should be an overall racing cost of 30-seconds.

While repairs are made to the crash wall and the cars return to the pits on LAP 27, discussions are under way over the potential penalty for Hamilton and Mercedes for illegally pitting.

The Brit is arguing that, although there were red lights along parabolica indicating the pit lane was closed, there was no red light at the entrance of the pit. 

The race has been suspended as a result of Leclerc's crash. The collision was so severe that race marshals need to reinstate that crash wall.

The safety car is back out following that horrible crash. Antonio Giovinazzi has been handed a 10-second penalty for pitting illegally. 

'Are we going to get a penalty?' Hamilton asks over the team radio. 'I think we will,' his engineer says. 

Big crash on the parabolica. It's Charles Leclerc and was a horrific crash into the barrier. It looks like he is moving. 

He's talking over the team radio and climbs out of the cockpit, which is a very good sign.

The back end of his car gives way and he has to counter-steer but he can't keep the car on track and it goes crashing into the barrier.  

LAP 24/53: The order has been reshuffled dramatically following that safety car period. Hamilton is back in first and Sainz, who played by the rules, is down in 8th.

Charles Leclerc, meanwhile, has moved all the way up to 4th(!), overtaking both Raikkonen and Giovinazzi on the first corner. 

Hamilton will be putting his pedal to the metal now as he looks to open a gap in anticipating of a likely time penalty. 

LAP 23/53: Replays from Hamilton's car cam shows that the lights along the parabolica corner were red, indicating the pit lane was closed when he entered to change his tyres. So it looks likely that he will be in trouble for that.

The pit lane has now been opened and both Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris have come in to change their tyres.

Bottas, Ricciardo, Perez and Verstappen have all pitted too as the safety car does its final circuit and will return to the pits.

LAP 22/53: This is a very interesting turn of events. The pit lane was closed as the race marshals push Magnussen's car back into the garage. Could Hamilton be in trouble for changing his tyres there? 

Antonio Giovinazzi also changed his tyres, and the pair are being investigated for that.

And it's not a virtual safety car, but a real safety car that has been deployed. Hamilton takes the opportunity to take a free pit stop. He's on the medium compound. Carlos Sainz has opted to stay out, as has Lando Norris and Sergio Perez. Sainz is now in the lead!

LAP 20/53: Kevin Magnussen pulls to one side and the yellow flag is waved. 

'Oh something broke,' the Haas driver says. 

No sign yet of a virtual safety car, as Pierre Gasly pits. 

McLaren certainly keeping their cool!

Everyone doing okay?🧡 #ItalianGP

LAP 19/53: Leclerc pits and switches onto the hard tyre, hoping to see out the race on this new set. 

Renault may be plotting an undercut for Daniel Ricciardo, although they want to stick the Australian on the mediums, which may not last until the end of the race if changed at this stage. 

LAP 18/53: Hamilton chops down the fastest lap time by six-tenths, clocking in at 1:24.626. Bottas is back on the team radio.

'I can't race with these engine settings. It's a joke'. He's not happy at all. 

Meanwhile, Alex Albon takes Charles Leclerc on for 13th and wins that battle, with the Ferrari dropping down the field. 

LAP 16/53: The last time McLaren had both cars in the top three was back in 2014 at Silverstone, and both Norris and Sainz look very comfortable indeed.

The Mexican is due to join Ferrari at the end of the season, penny for his thoughts right now.

'Move off the line when you can,' Mercedes tell Bottas. 'I'm doing that all the time,' the Finn responds as Max Verstappen closes in behind. 

LAP 14/53: Bottas' car is heating up now, and Mercedes are wary that the Finn needs to get out of the slipstream to cool the car down.

The plan had been to go long, but they may be plotting to go early in a bid to undercut the rest of the field. 

LAP 13/53: Hamilton is still out in front and has clocked the fastest lap of 1:25.225. He is 7.5 seconds ahead of Sainz in 2nd and is absolutely cruising at the moment. 

Bottas is behind a DRS train now and is still stuck behind Daniel Ricciardo's Renault.

LAP 11/53: While Vettel is out of the race, his Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc is still languishing in 13th. 

LAP 10/53: The two McLarens have had a very strong start and haven't been challenged too strongly by those chasing. Sergio Perez is looking to close the gap on Lando Norris in third, who is holding a one-second advantage over the Racing Point. 

Lewis Hamilton is looking very comfortable after ten laps. 

LAP 8/53: Vettel has crawled back into the pits and that'll be the end of his race at Monza. Stewards have given Alex Albon a five-second penalty for failing to leave a car's width to the edge of the track earlier in the race.

LAP 7/53: Now then, there's a big issue for Vettel. He's reporting brake failure after going through polystyrene blocks. 'No more brake pedal, brake wire exploded'.

It just goes from bad to worse for Vettel, an absolutely dismal season.

LAP 5/53: Plan B is triggered for Bottas by Mercedes, they're going to go long out on this first set of tyres. 

The top ten after five laps...

1. Hamilton

2. Sainz

3. Norris

4. Perez

5. Ricciardo

6. Bottas

7. Verstappen

8. Stroll

9. Ocon

10. Gasly

LAP 4/53: Meanwhile, Race Control have noted an incident between Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon, with a coming together between the pair on the opening corner. There will be no investigation for that. 

LAP 3/53: Valtteri Bottas has it all to do as he is told that things like okay from the pit wall's point of view as Max Verstappen looks to bypass Lance Stroll's Racing Point, he manages to squeeze past through Turn One and climb up to 7th. 

Replays of that start show Sainz got off to a great start while Bottas and Verstappen reacted very slowly indeed to drop places.

LAP 2/53: it's a brilliant start for McLaren, too, with Sainz moving up to 2nd and Norris is in third. Verstappen has had a woeful start and is down from 5th to 8th. 

LAP 1/53: Lights out and we're under way for the Italian Grand Prix! And it's a frantic opening, with Hamilton leading the pack but Valtteri Bottas has had an awful start, he's done to sixth! Has he got a mechanical problem? He says he's got a puncture.

The drivers are in their cars and are off on the formation lap now. We could be set for the fastest ever Formula One race this afternoon, with only 53 laps being raced on this short track.

Five minutes to go until lights out.

Pirelli say the quickest strategy today is 24 laps on the softs then the remaining 29 on the medium tyre.

Time to strategise. 🇮🇹 #ItalianGP #F1 #Fit4F1 pic.twitter.com/kUDQKkIToF

Just over ten minutes to go until the Italian GP gets underway. Lewis Hamilton will be looking to lead from start to finish once again but there are plenty of interesting narratives ahead of today's race.

Carlos Sainz did superbly to seal third place in qualifying but he will have a battle on his hands to keep Max Verstappen at bay, who has more pace than the McLaren in his Red Bull.

Meanwhile, Ferrari will be looking for a respectable result after a series of underwhelming results this season.

The drivers are out on the track and have come together in sending the sport's 'End Racism' message. 13 take the knee while seven remain standing. Lewis Hamilton is not in attendance.

The Italian national anthem is now being played and we're inching closer to lights out here at Monza.

This weekend has seen the introduction of a new rule that was introduced in the hope of balancing things out across the field. 

The ban on party mode for qualifying and the race - which restricts teams in using a single-mode engine only - had very little impact on Hamilton and Bottas in qualifying, despite the fact teams such as Red Bull had reportedly called for the ban in a bid to close the gap.

In fact, Red Bull's Max Verstappen - who has predominately occupied third for much of the season - fell down to places in qualifying yesterday, and will begin the race behind Carlos Sainz and Sergio Perez. 

Here's the starting grid for the start of the race at Monza. Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel will begin outside of the points, in 13th and 17th respectively.

Today's race will be the last in which a Williams family member is in charge of the team, marking the end of the family's long presence in the sport. 

Sir Frank Williams founded the team in 1977 and transformed it into one of the most successful teams in F1, winning nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' championships.

The other big story emerging today involves Renault, who will be re-branded next season as Alpine.

The team will take on the new name and also have a new team colour scheme with the yellow and black being scrapped for a red, white and blue set-up synonymous with the French flag.

Hello and welcome to Sportsmail’s live coverage of the Italian Grand Prix from Monza.

Just who can stop Lewis Hamilton? That will be the question lingering around the garages of the other teams as the Mercedes man looks an unmoveable force after yet another qualifying masterclass on Saturday.

It will be a case of damage limitation for Ferrari today, as The Prancing Horse looking for a respectable result with a car that is just not showing any pace this season. Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel will begin the race outside the points.

Stay tuned as Sportsmail provides live coverage of all the action from Monza, with the race set to get underway at 2.10pm BST.
