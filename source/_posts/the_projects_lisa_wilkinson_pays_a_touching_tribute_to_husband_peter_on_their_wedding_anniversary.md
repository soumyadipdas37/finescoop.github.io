The Project host Lisa Wilkinson has paid a touching tribute to her husband Peter FitzSimons on their wedding anniversary. 

On Saturday, the 60-year-old shared her throwback wedding picture and a vow renewal photo to express her joy in 'defying the people who said they wouldn't last' after they walked down the aisle in 1992 nine months after they first met. 

'Here we are, an old married couple, three beautiful kids and exactly 28 years later, still muddling through, still holding hands and still the first ones we want to confide in,' the TV star lovingly wrote in her Instagram caption.

Lisa highlighted she was happier than ever with her broadcaster Peter, with who share three adult children, Jake, 25, Louis, 23 and Billi, 21.

Despite the 'loud voices' telling her she wouldn't last with Peter, Lisa joyfully explained they are still 'encouraging, supporting and trusting each other' years later.

'When Pete and I met way back at Xmas in 1991, there were many - including my sweet, protective mum - who said we wouldn't last.

'[We] are still defying those who thought we wouldn't make it.'

Lisa also recalled finally being able to understand the true meaning of marriage as she renewed her wedding vows with Peter three years earlier.

The brunette went on to explain that their marriage didn't come without its low moments, and the pair have seen their fair share of arguments.

'It ain't perfect, but we wouldn't have it any other way. So here's to our beautiful supportive village. And our imperfect union. Happy anniversary sweetheart. ❤️❤️❤️.'

Back in May, Lisa revealed it took her late mother, Beryl, 25 years to approve of the relationship with Peter. 

'My mum was not a believer in Pete. It took many years. She thought we got married too quickly,' she told The Australian Women's Weekly.

'She's always acknowledged Pete's extraordinary generosity towards her but a few times she told him she was unconvinced we were right for each other.'

Beryl died of cancer in 2018, at the age of 89.
