The stars of Line of Duty were seen filming around West Belfast, as the production for the long-awaited sixth season of the detective show continued on Monday.  

Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar, who all returned to set a few weeks ago following a five-month hiatus, sported face masks as they tapped into full concentration mode in their respective roles as DS Steve Arnott, DI Kate Fleming and Superintendent Ted Hastings. 

The much-loved trio were out filming a dramatic scene involving armed police and a pistol-wielding assailant in a balaclava.

Numerous assistants were on hand in personal protective career, as the actors waited around to begin their shoot. 

Winter appeared to have come early to Belfast, as Vicky wore a thick orange hoody and Adrian sported a thick woollen orange and navy high-collared jacket.    

The street had been closed for shooting with masked crew members seen milling around with the cast.

Filming resumed earlier this month on the sixth series of Line of Duty, with new cast member Shalom Brune-Franklin seen for the first time on set recently.

The show was created and written by Jed Mercurio and is centred on the AC-12 Anti-Corruption Unit led by Supt Ted Hastings [Adrian Dunbar].

Production of the eagerly anticipated sixth season of the hugely popular series was halted by the Covid lockdown shortly after filming began earlier this year. 

Line Of Duty insisted that they have worked with health and safety consultants in accordance to government guidelines to ensure the safety of cast and crew.

Executive Producer for World Productions, Simon Heath, said: 'It's been almost six months since we stopped shooting.

'But following our implementation of all the industry Covid protocols, we're delighted to be able to resume filming series six safely.'          

The new series of Line Of Duty will premiere on BBC One in 2021.
