He showed off his abs as he used his top to wipe sweat from his face before grabbing his girlfriend and lifting her over his shoulder. 

Kris was clearly feeling in a playful mood as he gave Bianca a little bite on the bottom as they larked around together.  

He used to be in a romance with Katie Price, 41, but things turned sour between them and she's now in a relationship with Carl Woods, 31.

Bianca recently revealed she moved in with Kris after their first date in a new interview. 

The couple took their relationship to the next level as they spent the UK's nationwide lockdown together just weeks after embarking on a romance. 

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other.

Kris new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.' 

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out.

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year. 

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar.
