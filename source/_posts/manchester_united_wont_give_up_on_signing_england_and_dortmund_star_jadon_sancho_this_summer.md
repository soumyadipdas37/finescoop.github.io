Manchester United are reportedly unwilling to abandon their pursuit to sign Jadon Sancho until the England star publicly admits he wants to remain at Borussia Dortmund. 

A move for the £108-million-rated forward had looked dead in the water with talks stalling but United now have renewed hope a deal may be able to be salvaged. 

20-year-old Sancho has remained tight-lipped throughout the saga while Dortmund chiefs have insisted he will spend at least one more season in Germany.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had made Sancho his No 1 target but talks over a £108m deal have stalled

Negotiations to bring Sancho to Old Trafford were encumbered by the two clubs' difference in valuation and the players' wage demands but The Sun claim United are still not ready to give up on a deal.

United are believed to have offered between £60m and £70m up front with significant add-ons for Sancho - which was rebuffed by Dortmund - and conceded his £300,000-a-week wages would shatter their pay structure.

However, they believe they could still land their man if he pushes for a move this summer and want the England international to make a statement clarifying his plans for the immediate future.

Despite this, United have already turned their attentions to other targets with Ajax's Donny van de Beek set to sign after a £40m fee was agreed.

The club, meanwhile, are closing in on signing Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40m

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also wants to add a centre-back this summer and is looking at RB Leipzig's Dayot Upamecano.

The highly-sought after Frenchman won't come cheap and it's understood United are open to the idea of offloading Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo in a bid to fund a move.

Meanwhile, a move for Aston Villa's Jack Grealish continues to be mooted and Sportsmail understands the two clubs have held talks over a possible £80m deal.

Grealish is a prime target for United but if they could revive talks for Sancho that would spell the end of their interest in the England new boy.
