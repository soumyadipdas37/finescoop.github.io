The Bachelor's Laura Byrne and Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson managed to keep news that they were expecting a second child secret for 20 weeks, or five months. 

And on Saturday, Laura, 31, revealed just how she managed to keep her pregnancy under wraps for so long. 

On Nova's Matt, Sarah and Matty J show, host Sarah McGilvray asked Laura: 'You are one of the most papped people in Sydney! How did you keep it under wraps?'   

'It was pretty easy really!' The Bachelor's Laura Byrne revealed this week how she kept her pregnancy secret for 20 weeks. Pictured: Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson, Laura and their daughter Marlie-Mae

'It was winter, it was lockdown, it was pretty easy really, I mean baggy T-shirts and stuff,' Laura replied. 

'A soon as it was getting warmer, I was like we might have to announce this as I don't want to be going for walks wearing jumpers in the middle of summer.'

'You've effectively been shackled to the bedroom for the last 20 weeks,' Laura's fiancé Matty said. 

'Alrighty! You don't need to tell them everything that's going on!' Laura joked.

Thank you lockdown! Laura said the COVID-19 pandemic and wearing 'baggy' clothes helped her conceal her baby bump for months. She is pictured with fellow Bachelor contestant and podcast co-host Brittany Hockley during her recent holiday in Byron Bay

On Thursday, Laura and Matty announced that they're expecting their second child together.  

'I reckon we've kept this little beach ball under wraps for long enough..... Half way to number two,' Laura wrote in an Instagram post at the time.

'A big shout out to @matthewdavidjohnson for his contribution,' she joked.

Earlier this month, the pair celebrated their three-year anniversary after meeting and falling in love on The Bachelor exactly three years ago.  

Matty and Laura became engaged in April 2019.

They welcomed their daughter Marlie-May in June last year.
