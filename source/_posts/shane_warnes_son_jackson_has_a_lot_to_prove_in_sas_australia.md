Jackson Warne has signed on to star in Channel Seven's new military-style reality show SAS Australia.

And in a trailer for the October premiere, released on Sunday, the 21-year-old said he has something to prove in that he's not just cricket legend 'Shane Warne's son'.

'I'm tougher than that. I want him to be really proud of me,' a determined Jackson announced on screen.

The trailer saw Jackson revealed as one of the new recruits, alongside model and former Miss Universe Australia Erin McNaught.

He is certainly pushed to his limits in the upcoming series, enduring gruelling challenges including being submerged in water.

Elsewhere in the trailer, an emotional Jackson was scolded by what appeared to be a former British soldier.

'You told me you have something to prove? Do it!' the soldier directed at Jackson. 

In an interview with news.com.au last year, Jackson revealed that during his childhood he felt immense pressure to follow in his father's footsteps.

'I played [cricket] one year when I was at school, and in one of the games it got in the newspaper and made some articles,' he said.

'The whole pressure factor... I could never be that good, I could never try to be that good.'

Regardless of whether he had talent or not, Jackson added that he had no desire to get into cricket. 

'The pressure and expectations... I just was not really interested. But when we were going through school, it didn't matter what we wanted to do, dad just wanted us to be happy.'

Alongside Jackson and Erin, other stars confirmed include convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, publicist Roxy Jacenko and comedian Merrick Watts.
