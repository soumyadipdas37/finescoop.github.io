A hungry woman caught breaking Melbourne's strict Stage Four coronavirus lockdowns told police she had driven 75km from her home to buy a kebab. 

The woman was pulled over by officers in Werribee, south-west of Melbourne, on Monday night after the city's 8pm to 5am curfew was in effect. 

When questioned, she told the officers she was from Geelong and had traveled the lengthy drive to Melbourne in search of the snack and was then going to visit her boyfriend in Werribee. 

Melburnians are set to endure an extended Stage Four lockdown until the end of September (pictured: residents walking through one of the city's parks for their allowed recreation) 

The woman was one of 171 people fined in Victoria for breaching the Chief Health Officer directions in Victoria in the last 24 hours. 

Two women were also fined after they were caught out walking and eating ice-cream at 2am, telling police they thought it was 6am. 

And a man was fined who was found cycling in South Melbourne after curfew who told police said he was going to visit his 'semi-intimate partner'. 

In total the fines included 31 penalties for failing to wear a face covering when leaving home for one of the four approved reasons. 

The four approved reason are to shop for food and necessary goods, to provide care, for compassionate reasons or to seek medical treatment, to exercise or for outdoor recreation, for work or education, if you can't do it from home. 

Also 21 fines were dished out at vehicle checkpoints in Victoria and 67 people were fined for breaching Melbourne's curfew. 

Across the state on Monday 21,482 vehicles were stopped at vehicle checkpoints, while 3,704 spot checks on people at houses, businesses and public places were conducted.
