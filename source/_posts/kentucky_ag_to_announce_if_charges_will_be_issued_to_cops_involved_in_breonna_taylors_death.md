The Kentucky Attorney General is set to announce whether charges will be filed against the Louisville Metro Police Department officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor soon, reports suggest.

Multiple sources confirmed to WAVE 3 that the case is being presented to a grand jury this week at an undisclosed location. 

The office of Kentucky AG David Cameron has been investigating the shooting death of Taylor, who was killed by LMPD narcotics officers as they served a no-knock warrant at her Louisville home in March.

An announcement on whether charges will be filed is not expected from Cameron's office until at least next week, WAVE 3 sources said, nearly six months on from Taylor's death.

The three officers who fired their weapons that night have been at the center of public backlash, with protesters demanding they be fire and charged with murder. 

One of officers, Brett Hankison, was fired for 'blindly' firing 10 shots into Taylor’s apartment from outside, according to his termination letter. The other two officers remain on the force.

Breonna Taylor, 26, pictured, died in the early hours of March 13 after cops raided her home in Louisville. An incident report on her death released this week by Louisville police, three months after the shooting, is virtually blank and provides inaccuracies and inconsistencies

Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was fatally shot eight times by police as they served a no-knock warrant at her apartment on March 13 and opened fire.

Police descended on Taylor’s apartment that night after securing a court-approved warrant as part of a drugs investigation that allowed officers to enter her home without any prior warning. 

The suspect at the center of the probe had apparently lived at the same address years earlier and continued to receive packages there.

Taylor and Walker had been sleeping in bed when the officers served the warrant at around 1am. Believing they were soon to be victims of a home invasion, Walker, a licensed gun owner, fired a shot into the direction of the doorway, striking Sergeant John Mattingly in the leg.

Officer Brett Hankinson then returned fire, discharging his weapon in the direction of Walker 10 times. Breonna Taylor was hit eight times and was pronounced dead at the scene.

‘Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend,’ a frantic Walker told dispatchers in a 911 call.

Unbeknown to the officers at Taylor’s home, the suspect they were actually searching for had been taken into custody hours earlier in a separate location.
