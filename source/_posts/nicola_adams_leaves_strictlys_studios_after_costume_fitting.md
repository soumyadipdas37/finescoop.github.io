The retired athlete, 37, put on a defiant display as she left the compound smiling, after it emerged more than 100 people have complained to the BBC. 

Nicola will make history on the show by starring in the first ever same-sex pairing, but the groundbreaking move has prompted a flurry of complaints from some viewers.

Nicola cut a casual figure in a bright pink tie-dye anime T-shirt which she teamed with a bomber jacket and jeans.

She opted for comfort on her feet and wore a fancy silver watch on her hand. 

Her costume fitting comes as the BBC has defended having a same-sex pairing on this year's series.

Controversy: Nicola will make history on the show by starring in the first ever same-sex pairing, but the groundbreaking move has prompted a flurry of complaints from some viewers

In a statement the corporation said the competition is an 'inclusive show' and they are 'proud' to have had same-sex numbers in previous series.

Nicola is set to become the first celebrity contestant in Strictly's history to be paired with a woman when the show returns in five weeks.  

The BBC said: 'Strictly Come Dancing is an inclusive show and is proud to have featured same sex dancing amongst the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series.

Defending: Her costume fitting comes as the BBC has defended having a same-sex pairing on this year's series 

'We have stated, in the past, that we are open to the prospect of including same sex pairings between our celebrities and professional dancers, should the opportunity arise. 

'Nicola Adams requested an all-female pairing, which we are happy to facilitate. The show is first and foremost about dance, the sex of each partner within a coupling should have no bearing on their routine.'

Last year male professional dancers Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima performed a same sex routine during the show's seventeenth series.  

While the dance - conducted during a performance by pop star Emeli Sande - was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response on social media, it prompted 200 complaints with TV regulator Ofcom.  

Setting the tone: Nicola enters the competition after male professionals Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima performed a same sex routine during the show's seventeenth series in 2019

MailOnline contacted Strictly and Nicola's representative for a comment at the time. 

Nicola recently spoke about her upcoming appearance on the show, saying she is ready to 'break boundaries' as part of first same-sex couple in show's history

She told the Guardian: 'I guess it’s just breaking those boundaries and showing people that it’s OK.

'It’s not such an uncommon thing: professional dancers dance with people of the same sex all the time; you dance in a nightclub with your friends. 

'I just wanted to break down the thing of it being a big deal when it’s not really a big deal.' 

With her dance partner yet to be confirmed, Nicola believes she will be given the male role when the show gets underway because of her aversion to traditionally feminine clothes, adding:  'Dresses aren’t my thing.'  

Complaints: Ahead of Strictly returning to TV in five weeks time, the BBC has already received complaints from people about Nicola's pairing (pictured during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games)
