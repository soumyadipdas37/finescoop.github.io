Yazmin Oukhellou has penned a hilarious love poem to show her appreciation for her boyfriend James Lock on the latest episode of The Only Way Is Essex. 

The couple, who are back together after they called it quits last year, met up with their pals Amber Turner, Dan Edger, Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallet where Yazmin proudly read out her poem.

Announcing to the group she had penned the piece about James, Amber said: 'You can't just do that and not read it to us! We want to hear it.'

Yazmin then took out a notebook and read aloud: 'Oh James, James, I'm sick of these wine games.  Lockie, you're looking a little bit stocky. Why are you always so cocky? 

'You look good in pink, but your feet really stink.  You've got good chat but sometimes you're a t**t. 

'I love your golden tan, you're a very handsome man. I love the way you look at me like a character from Glee. 

'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids.'

Yazmin and James are back on and were spotting sharing a steamy kiss as they filmed with their co-stars on Tuesday. 

Yazmin dumped Lockie over claims he had cheated on her while they were on a romantic holiday together in Turkey, and has said she still doesn't trust him but wouldn't say 'no' if he popped the question.

Speaking to The Sun, the brunette beauty said: 'We are trying to take things really slow but I know what I am like.

'I do love him and if he did propose to me I would say yes and marry him. I still don't trust him but I do trust him more this time, which is strange because he messed up. But I do believe he has changed.'

Yazmin read out: 'Oh James, James, I'm sick of these wine games. Lockie, you're looking a little bit stocky. Why are you always so cocky?'

Fun: Amber and Dan laughed as she read: 'You look good in pink, but your feet really stink. You've got good chat but sometimes you're a t**t' 

Yazmin also revealed that the couple are now having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom after starting during lockdown, which is helping get their broken relationship back on track. 

She added that her family and friends around her are still sceptical about the reunion but that she needs to 'prove everyone wrong'.

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.

Yazmin read: 'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids' 

They looked as loved up as ever, showing signs they were on the road to returning to a fully fledged romance, with a source saying 'sparks are flying' between them.

At the time a source told The Sun: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.

'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'

The Only Way Is Essex airs on ITVBe on Wednesday at 9pm. 

Love: It comes after Yazmin revealed she would marry James if he proposed tomorrow
