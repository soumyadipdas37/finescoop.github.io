This wasn’t quite as heart-stopping or insane as Saturday’s clash between these two teams but Manchester United will be perfectly comfortable with that.

They are through to the EFL Cup quarter finals after recording their second win over Brighton in the space of five days.

Juan Mata was the heartbeat of this comprehensive victory, setting up one before putting the finishing touch on quite exquisite team goal.



And after the madness of what took place here at the Amex on Saturday afternoon, Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer will have been happy for the easy ride last night.

It was hardly vintage United. Equally, this wasn't a full strength United either. Nonetheless, the likes of Donny van de Beek and Eric Bailly will be better for this run out.

As will Dean Henderson, whose reputation continues to grow following a second successive clean sheet in a United shirt.

Brighton, as they always do, stuck to their guns until the dying moments. But truth be told - but for a 10 minute spell in the second half - United had this game under control from start to finish.

This was always going to have an air of after the Lord Mayor’s Show about it. After Saturday’s chaos during the Premier League encounter between these two teams - this was destined to be inferior.

Not withstanding the competition - the Carabao Cup hardly priority for either side - both managers made a total of 19 changes, Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer making 10 of those.

That meant another start for goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who is now applying genuine pressure on recognised No 1 David De Gea for the role as United’s undisputed first choice.

Not that he, or opposing goalkeeper Jason Steele, had much to do during a largely mundane opening 45 minutes that didn’t catch fire until its dying embers.

Following a tepid start, United fashioned the first opportunity, Odion Ighalo rounding Steele following Juan Mata’s pass only to fire into the side netting in the 18th minute.

Henderson comfortably completed his first save of the evening in the 26th minute, denying Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s tame effort from the edge of the box following a period of sustained pressure from Brighton.

Just after that, the heavens opened over the Amex Stadium. In truth, watching the thrashing rain lash down was about as entertaining it got during the opening 40 minutes or so.

Urgency was lacking, invention was lacking, everything was lacking.

That’s not say the clash was void of any quality whatsoever. Mata oozed class whenever he had the ball at his feet, while Lewis Dunk - as ever - was a dominant force in the heart of Brighton’s rearguard.

But make no mistake, this was a drab and dull affair. However, just as the first-half looked defined to finish goalless, Manchester United - or more precisely Mata - produced the first piece of genuine quality as the visitor's took a 44th minute lead.

Dan Burn was rightfully booked for pulling down the Spaniard, who was by far and away the best footballer on the pitch, down the right hand-side before the United midfielder produced a peach of a free-kick to allow Scott McTominay to thump his header past Steele.

Brighton fell asleep, in particular Bernardo who let McTominay burst past him to open the scoring. Not that Solsjkaer was fussed about that.

His side were far from their best, yet they were ahead. As his team headed back down the tunnel, that was all that mattered.

The rain didn't relent at the start of the second half. The entertainment levels didn’t improve much either.

But while Brighton certainly started the second period with more purpose, Henderson remained untested heading into the hour mark.

In truth, United were comfortable keeping Brighton at arms length - and with the likes of Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood on the bench Solskjaer was safe in the knowledge that he could call on the calvary if necessary.

The host’s continued to furrow down dead ends as United’s rearguard, well marshalled by Eric Bailly, nullified whatever goal threat they mustered.

But the older game drew, the more anxious United became. They only have themselves to blame for that, of course.

Having taken the lead on the stroke of half-time, surely the incentive was there to finish Brighton off.

Apparently not. Indeed, United were indebted to Henderson in the 67th minute, the keeper producing a brilliant stop to deny Leandro Trossard following dogged work on the edge of the area from Jason Molumby.

The keeper’s team-mates rushed towards their new colleague with a barrage of high-fives, the goalkeeper adding to the growing feeling that it’s a matter of when not if he overtakes De Gea.

The save proved the key moment in the game as United put their foot down on the gas to bulldoze Brighton in the closing stages.

Solskjaer had seen enough - throwing on Pogba and Rashford and the move worked a treat.

United wrapped up victory with two stunning goals: the first a sublime team effort that Mata expertly finished off in the 73rd minute as United’s nervousness subsided.

The second was a Pogba free-kick, aided by a deflection, as United strolled into the quarter-finals.

 

Host commentator

England must be calling for this lad now. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has netted consecutive Goodison Park hat-tricks to start the season as he hammers the final nail into the coffin of West Ham's Carabao Cup hopes.

Speaking of teams heading to the quarter-finals, Everton have doubled their lead over West Ham with Dominic Calvert-Lewin grabbing his second of the night. It's a pretty stacked looking last eight already heading into tomorrow night's draw.

Job done for Manchester United. Paul Pogba's deflected free-kick flies into the near post top corner to book the Red Devils a place in the quarter-finals.

Jayson Molumby is replaced by Max Sanders for Brighton while United send on Jesse Lingard for Fred. 

What a superb goal from Manchester United. With 18 minutes to play, Juan Mata calmly slots home a finish through the legs of Lewis Dunk past Jason Steele, but it was the smooth back heel from Donny van de Beek that needs to be remembered from this goal. Poetry from the summer arrival from Ajax to tee up the Spaniard.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs no more warnings about how this game is slipping out of United's control. He throws on Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford for Daniel James and Odion Ighalo.

David de Gea should be feeling the pressure as Manchester United's No 1 keeper, this is a magnificent save from Dean Henderson who reacts well by diving low to his left to keep out a first time effort from Trossard. That chance had looked goalbound.

Brighton have started the half well but are not creating enough to trouble United as they maker their second change by throwing on Lenadro Trossard for Viktor Gyokeres.

West Ham haven't managed to maintain their flying start to the half and now they are behind again. Just before the hour mark, Richarlison's effort finds the net via Declan Rice from 20 yards.

Meanwhile United win a free-kick around 30 yards out, but despite the ball bouncing awkwardly in front of him, Jason Steele saves well from Fred.

How about that to restart the second half on Merseyside! From 20 yards out Robert Snodgrass unleashes a thunderous effort that picks out the top corner. Keeper no chance!

Never in doubt for the competition holders, who ease into the quarter-finals thanks to Raheem Sterling's brace and a strike from Ferran Torres.

Problems for Brighton at the start of the second half. The lively Alireza Jahanbakhsh looks like he might have picked up a hamstring injury so he is replaced by Neal Maupay as the rain continues to pour on the south coast.

12 - Juan Mata has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 15 starts for Manchester United across all competitions (four goals and eight assists). Timeless.

Not long left at Turf Moor, City are cruising through at 3-0 with around five minutes to play.

On the stroke of half-time, United are in front in perhaps the simplest of fashion. Dan Burn is booked following a foul on Juan Mata, whose free-kick floated towards the back post is simply nodded across goal by Scott McTominay. Easy peasy but harsh on the hosts.

Riyad Mahrez fails to pick out Sterling for his hat-trick but what he does do is find Ferran Torres who applies a lovely finish to open his account following his summer move.

Jahanbakhsh is looking lively for the hosts. He has already tested Henderson once but he goes close again from the edge of the box, blasting a rising drive just over the near post top corner. Manchester United have made quite a laboured opening to this game.

Good effort from the home side. Alexis Mac Allister cuts inside from the left, evading a challenge before his dipping shot from the edge of the box just clears Dean Henderson's crossbar.

33 - Raheem Sterling has scored 33 goals for Manchester City since the start of last season; the most of any Premier League player across all competitions in this period. Relentless. https://t.co/w4BrjqSrg2

Half-chances for both teams. First Alireza Jahanbakhsh's low effort is well stopped by Dean Henderson (below), while at the other end Fred tests Steele with a low 25-yard shot.

Both good saves considering the greasy surface.

Chris Wood replaced Matej Vydra at the break for the hosts but it took just four minutes for Manchester City to double their lead with Raheem Sterling again on target to convert following an assist from Ferran Torres.

Chance for United. Juan Mata does well to release Odion Ighalo in on goal but after taking the ball past Jason Steele he runs out of angle and can only fire into the side netting.

We are back underway at Turf Moor by the way.

There is just no stopping Everton at the moment and there is no stopping Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

The striker has become a beast under Carlo Ancelotti this term and grabs his sixth goal of the season after converting a finish from inside the box.

No chances as of yet, just rain and lots of it. Neither side is really on top at this stage as the teams feel each other out.

Burnley are yet to have a shot on target. One way traffic in that first half.

A reminder of the team news and formations from the AMEX. Events are also underway at Goodison Park.

Very kind of Raheem Sterling to wait for the penalty shootout at Rodney Parade to end before firing Manchester City ahead, latching on to a cross from Benjamin Mendy before lashing home.

Newport survive a late Toon onslaught to earn a penalty shootout.

Just like at the weekend, Newcastle United have left it very late to save their skins.

Unlike at Tottenham though there is no controversy with this, just pure class from Jonjo Shelvey who from the edge of the box bends home a terrific finish across goal into the top corner with three minutes to play.

We are now into six added minutes, as the Toon now hope to win this in stoppage time and avoid penalties.

Manchester City are swarming all over Burnley in the early stages but no breakthrough yet despite Raheem Sterling being flagged offside after tapping home a Ferran Torres cross.

And if you ever needed to see an image that shows that summer is long gone. Rains and chilly evenings it is now then...

Just three players survive from this fixture at the weekend. Victor Lindelof retains his place for Manchester United while Brighton stick with Lewis Dunk and Ben White at the back.

David Moyes returns to his former club, who are looking for a sixth straight victory to begin the 2020-21 campaign.

The boys are back in Brighton! Here's how we line up for tonight's #CarabaoCup clash 🔴#MUFC

In the match that kicked off at 5.30pm, League Two side Newport County currently lead Newcastle 1-0 thanks to an early Tristan Abrahams strike. We are into the second half at Rodney Parade and what a way that would be to start off the night if that scoreline stays the same.

So what will the Carabao Cup bring us this evening as four teams look to join Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-finals of the competition following their shootout victory over Chelsea last night?

Hopefully a little bit more drama in the actual 90 minutes to be honest after a largely dull affair at White Hart Lane but otherwise good evening and welcome to our live coverage.

The Carabao Cup fourth round action continues on Wednesday as Brighton and Manchester United meet for the second time in four days with Graham Potter's men looking to avoid another narrow loss.

There are four teams looking to book a spot in the quarter-finals of the competition, joining Tottenham Hotspur who saw off Chelsea on penalties on Tuesday night.
