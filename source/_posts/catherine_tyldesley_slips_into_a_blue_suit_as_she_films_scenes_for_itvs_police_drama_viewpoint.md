She's joined a star-studded for one of ITV's first post-lockdown series.

Catherine was dressed in a smart navy blue blazer and oversized trousers as she prepared to film the scenes.

The former Strictly Come Dancing star teamed the ensemble with a teal blue silk shirt as she emerged from her car to stroll onto the set.

As she had her hair styled by a mask-clad crew member, Catherine was in high spirits as she prepared to film the scenes.

Sensational: She opted to keep her cosy brown boots as she prepared to film before changing into a pair of heels

Glammed up: Catherine was attended by members of the crew who styled her glossy brunette tresses into loose curls

Later star Bronagh Waugh was also seen in the midst of filming, wearing a casual black and white shirt with a green utility jacket.

Earlier in the filming schedule, Catherine appeared to be in the midst of an emotional scene as she wore a downcast expression whilst filming in front of a candle-lit vigil with Dominic Allburn and their co-stars.

She was seen holding her hands as if in prayer before her co-star wrapped his arms around her in comfort. 

Dark: Viewpoint is centred around a plot involving a tense police surveillance operation, and Catherine's character is yet to be revealed

Dark: The series is headed up by Fleabag director Harry Bradbeer, and centres around DC Martin King (played by Noel Clarke)

Dramatic: The series sees King set up his observation post in the home of single mother and secret voyeur, Zoe Sterling, played by Alexandra Roach

Serious: Zoe's windows look on to Westbury Square and the home of missing primary school teacher Gemma Hillman, played by Nicola Holt

Mysterious: She shares the home with boyfriend and prime suspect in her disappearance, Greg Sullivan, played by I May Destroy You actor Fehinti Balogun
