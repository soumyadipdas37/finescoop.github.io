Australians will be among the first in the world to trial a new Uber feature aiming to speed up passengers' commutes.

The tech giant is launching a new service next month which will allow users to plan the best route across Sydney using a mix of ride sharing and public transport.

This could involve catching an UberX to a bus stop, train station or ferry wharf for the next leg of the journey.

'Uber and Transit' will also provide real-time updates for public transport services on the mobile app.

Sydney and Chicago will be the first two cities in the world to trial the new service.

Uber said the Harbour City was chosen because of its commitment to open data and technology for transit services.  

New South Wales Transport and Roads Minister Andrew Constance said it will give passengers a chance to pick the fastest and cheapest commute. 

'It might mean they are better off using a mixture of Uber services and public transport to make their journey more cost effective and time efficient,' he said.

'This collaboration is so great, because it will help people make better decisions about getting around our city and as a result help to reduce congestion, which is a win for our transport commuters and a win for our drivers.'    

The new service follows the integration of public transport services on the app last year.

But the previous service only allowed users to compare whether it would be faster to travel using public transport or ride share services.
