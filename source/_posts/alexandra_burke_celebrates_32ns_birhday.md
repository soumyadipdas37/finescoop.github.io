She turned 32 on August 25 but Alexandra Burke was not keeping the celebrations to just one day. 

The singer spent a full week celebrating and documented some of her favourite moments from her parties with her family and friends. 

Her staircase was decorated with lots of colourful balloons including a '3' and a '2' balloon in rose gold.

'My birthday week was filled with so much love and laughter': Alexandra Burke shared pictures of her balloon filled house and lavish cakes as she celebrated her 32nd in style

Stairway to heaven: Her friends and family had really pulled out the stops for the occasion

Another picture showed a stunning lunchtime set-up she had with a giant balloon arch and massive heart shaped cushions to sit on. 

She posed with lots of her friends and had not one birthday cake, but several, including one topped with roses and cupcakes and a grazing board in the shape of her initials. 

Sharing her photos on social media, she wrote: 'I had the most amazing birthday week filled with so much love and laughter.

Fun times: Alexandra and her pals appeared to be having the best time 

Stunning: She was dressed to the nines, flashing her underwesr under a sheer ensemble

'I want to start and say a big thank you to my girls @naliniboyce & @juiceginandspin for going all out and making me feel so special. Love you ladies like cooked food!

'A shoutout and a big thank you to @grapeandfig @k.l_cakes @madewrightlondon @sleepyteepeeuk You all made the day even more magical. ❣️'

Last month, Alexandradeclared she's 'proud of my body and the skin I'm in' in a candid post shared to Instagram.

What a treat! She had more than one cake and this one was incredible, topped with roses and Ferroro Rocher

Tasty: There was a grazing board in the shape of her initials (left) and cupcakes decorated with pictures of her (right) 

The singer showcased her toned figure as she slipped into black lingerie by Lounge Underwear in a photo taken weeks before.

Months after revealing she was once told to lighten her complexion, the artist admitted she was apprehensive about uploading the radiant photo to social media at first, but later found the courage to be confident and embrace her 'blemishes'.

The brave media personality wrote in the accompanying caption: 'Scrolling through my phone and found this picture I took a few weeks ago...

Comfy: Another picture showed a stunning lunchtime set-up she had with a giant balloon arch and massive heart shaped cushions to sit on

'I wasn’t going to post it because I’m quick to put myself down... I’m finding that mental space to remind myself that i’m proud of my body and the skin I’m in.. blemishes and all... bring it on... ❤️.' (sic)

Alexandra's bold post came after she made an emotional revelation that she was told to bleach her skin after she won The X Factor in 2008.

The musician spoke in a candid Instagram video in which she said she was told she would have to work 'ten times harder than a white artist'.

The Islington native, who is of Jamaican descent, also delved into the 'microagressions' she experienced from various music labels throughout her career and how she has struggled.

A photo to remember: She showed off another staircase set-up which was covered in pink balloons as her pals posed for a snap

Every angle: She was so in love with the set-up, that she took lots of photos 

The TV star, who was visibly shaken, explained: 'The music industry is such a funny little place. I love signing, I love what I do but if it wasn't for the love that I have for music I definitely wouldn't be in this industry.

'A few reasons are, when I won the X Factor I was told, ''Right, because you are black, you are going to have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin...

'You can't have braids, you can't have an afro, you can't have anything that basically is my identity, you have to have hair, for example, that appeals to white people so they can understand you better.''

'That was so hard to digest. I was told to bleach my skin and that was something I refused to do.'

'Blemishes and all, bring it on!' Alexandra recently declared she's 'proud of my body and the skin I'm in' as she slipped into a Lounge Underwear set for a candid Instagram post
