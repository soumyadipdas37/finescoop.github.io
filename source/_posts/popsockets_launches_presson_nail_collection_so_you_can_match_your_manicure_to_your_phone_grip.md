Beauty lovers who have been looking to step up their game can now add some extra flair to their next manicure - by coordinating it to their phone grip. 

Phone accessory brand PopSockets has made a move into the manicure industry by launching its own press-on nail collection - all of which come with a coordinating phone grip so that nail art fans can ensure that they never leave home without a matching manicure-and-phone combination. 

The collection, which debuted online on September 8, features 15 different nail and PopSocket designs, from patterns and prints to glitters and metallics; nails can be purchased with a coordinating grip, or by themselves. 

Mani-ficent! PopSockets has launched its own collection of press-on nails so beauty lovers can coordinate their manicure with their phone grip 

Razzle dazzle: The Mani Phoni collection features 15 different designs, including prints and patterns as well as glittery and metallic options 

Fashion forward: Prices for the collection range between $10 and $13 for the nails by themselves, and $20 and $28 for the nails and a coordinating phone grip 

Prices for the Mani Phoni collection range between $10 and $13 for the nails, and $20 and $28 for the nails-and-phone grip combos. 

'PopSockets Nails is the first press-on, ready-to-wear instant manicure adhesive kit that coordinates with the ubiquitous and beloved PopGrip,' the brand said in a statement. 

'The Mani Phoni collection comes in a variety of 15 fun, expressive graphics and sophisticated premium materials like starry skies, rose gold metallic, shimmer shift, unicorn marble, opal and more.'

According to the brand, the nails are all lined with a 'thin gel adhesive hidden behind a peel-off film' for easy application, and they are designed to last for up to five days. 

Each nail set comes complete with 30 nails in varying sizes, two prep pads, a mini nail file, and a cuticle stick to make the application process as easy as possible. 

For anyone looking to take their matchy matchy look to the next level, several of the nail designs also coordinate with some of the brand's face mask designs, meaning that you can yet add another layer to your PopSocket-focused look.

The new collection was met with intrigue on social media, with some hailing the idea as 'genius', while others insisted that matching a manicure to a PopSocket is a style step too far in their opinion.

'I am exactly this extra and I’m broke but getting some anyway,' one person commented on Instagram, while another simply wrote: 'Cute! Love the colors!' 

One person then chimed in: 'So exciting! Thanks for making my dream a reality.'

Meanwhile on Twitter, one user poked fun at the idea - however quickly admitted that she is still planning to buy them for herself, writing: 'So wait, [you] can match your PopSocket [with] your nails now!? That must be the stupidest idea since sliced bread. 

'Lmao, j/k y’all want some of my money? Bet.'

Not everyone was impressed with the concept however, including one person on Twitter who commented: 'Is anyone else like super f**king confused by PopSocket nails??'
