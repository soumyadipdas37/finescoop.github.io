A daughter who was lied to for 45 years about the whereabouts of her mother has spoken out about the horror of learning her dad had killed her and buried her body in the garden.

Geoffrey Adams, now 72, killed his wife Colleen, who was 24, by hitting her on the head with a metal bar at their Maitland home on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula in 1973. 

Adams buried his wife in a pink nightgown in the backyard of their home and lied to his family about her whereabouts for four decades - before finally confessing in 2018. 

He told their daughter Marie that her mother had the 'baby blues' and abandoned the pair, along with her sister, until she finally found out the truth just two years ago. 

Ms Adams said she was stuck in a 'bubble of secrecy' for most of her life while giving a victim impact statement to the South Australian Supreme Court on Thursday.

'I felt like I'd been living with the sins of my mother but I was living with the sins of my father,' Ms Adams said, according to ABC News. 

'As a child, I'd been told my mother had the baby blues and I'd been responsible for her leaving. That generated a belief system that I was unlovable. 

Ms Adams said she was 'devastated' to find out her father killed her mother - but relieved to know that her mother had always loved her.  

'The most meaningful moment from all of this has been knowing my mother did love me and she didn't chose to abandon me,' she said.

Growing up, Ms Adams said she would ask her father about her mother but he would dismiss them and discourage her from asking more. 

She said he constantly put her down, said her mother was unkind and spoke badly about women in general. 

Ms Adams said she felt abandoned and rejected by the thought that her mother left her, which lead her to believe she was never good enough. 

This resulted in Ms Adams repeatedly having unhealthy relationships where she tried to appease everyone later in life, she bravely admitted in the heartfelt statement to court.

Ms Adams' daughter Isabella also gave a statement at court on Thursday as well as Colleen Adams' sisters Kristina Burford and Heather Johncock. 

After confessing to killing his wife, Geoffrey Adams lead police to the remains of her body under concrete slabs in the backyard of their home in 2018. 

Adams was found not guilty of murdering his then 24-year-old wife Colleen after a trial by jury, who rejected that he had murderous intent.  

Instead, Adams pleaded guilty to his Colleen's manslaughter and is currently awaiting sentencing. He will be sentenced before Christmas.
