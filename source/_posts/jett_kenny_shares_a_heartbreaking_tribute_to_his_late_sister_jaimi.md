'You gave me a slight insight into fashion by dressing me in up in dresses and putting makeup on me when I was young. you'd sit behind me while I ate dinner and would pick at anything pimple looking on my back - even if it was just a mole,' he added.

'You were my second mother, you were my biggest sister, you were my friend, and you were a fighter until the very end,' he continued.

The daughter of Australian sporting greats Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic.

Jaimi Kenny passed away at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father.

The 33-year-old had been supported by her parents and siblings through many years of treatment at private clinic End ED, on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.

Shattered staff at the clinic said they could not discuss Jaimi's struggle, but told how she became part of the 'family' over the years.

Despite her struggles with weight, friends of Jaimi told how she always brought 'light and laughter' to the lives of those she around her. 

Lisa Curry marked her daughter's death with a tragic statement.

'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' Lisa wrote.

'So loved. So beautiful. So kind to everyone... So painful. I can barely breathe.'
