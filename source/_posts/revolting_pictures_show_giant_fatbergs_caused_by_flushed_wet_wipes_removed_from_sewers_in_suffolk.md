Disgusting photos reveal giant 'fatbergs' blocking Suffolk sewers caused by flushing wet wipes and cotton buds down the toilet.  

The images have been shared online showing the consequences of flushing items, including nappies and sanitary products, down the toilet.

When these items combine with fats, oils and greases in the sewers, they create 'fatbergs', which cause blockages and pollution.

The photos, published on Twitter by Anglican Water earlier this week were taken at Fornham Water Recycling Centre in Suffolk.

They show a skip full of waste extracted from the sewers which has been causing blockages, which is said to cost £19million a year to unclog. 

Anglian Water is running a Keep It Clear campaign to educate people about the consequences of flushing items down the toilet. 

A spokesman said: 'We clear 40,000 blockages across our network every single year and that equates to one blockage roughly every five minutes. 

'Of these blockages, 85% are completely avoidable but cost us a whopping £19million a year to keep our sewers free of them. 

'This money could ultimately be better spent elsewhere.

'Not only that, but blockages can lead to sewer flooding in people's homes and pollution in the wider environment.

'This is why people should only flush the three P's down their toilet 'pee, poo and (toilet) paper.' 

Since the Keep It Clear campaign began, sewer blockages have dropped by an average of 52%.
