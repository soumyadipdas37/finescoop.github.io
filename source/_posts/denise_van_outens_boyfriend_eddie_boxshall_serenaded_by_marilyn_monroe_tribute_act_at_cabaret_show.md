She lovingly dubbed him 'The One', after they managed to get through the entire stretch of the COVID-19 lockdown without getting into a single argument.

And Denise Van Outen, 49, got to see just how much of a good sport her beau Eddie Boxshall, 47, is on Monday, when she dragged him onto the stage during her Cabaret All Stars show at London's Proud Embankment.

During the show, the blonde beauty beckoned her handsome partner to join her in the spotlight, before he was serenaded by Marilyn Monroe tribute act Isabella Bliss.

Denise recently told MailOnline that her beau, was 'The One' given they didn't argue once during lockdown together at their Essex home .

She said: 'After all of this I can honestly say that Eddie, out of anyone I've ever been with, is the person I genuinely get on the best with. We have got on so well. 

'We have not had one argument or fall out the whole of lockdown. We have really enjoyed each other's company.

'He is definitely The One. If there was ever a test then it's lockdown. We have had a lot of laughs together.' 

However the star has ruled out having any more children but is still hoping to tie the knot with Eddie soon when they're able to without any social distancing.

She said: 'About three years ago we did talk about having kids, but I'm 46, Eddie is 47 and I know people do still have babies in their mid 40s but between us we have three kids and we love our lives at the moment.

'I was obviously a single mum for five years of Betsy's life and it was hard at times but now she's older and we've got freedom to enjoy ourselves.

'But we have talked about getting married. We certainly wouldn't do it at the moment. We wouldn't want a socially distanced wedding.

'At some point it would be nice. We have discussed it and said it would be nice to do but it has to be the right time and this year isn't it.' 

Denise shares her daughter Betsy, ten, with her ex-husband Lee Mead while Eddie is a father to two including his 21-year-old daughter Leah.
