Authentic has staved off a late charge from favorite Tiz the Law to win the 146th running of the Kentucky Derby.

The victory for legendary trainer Bob Baffert's Authentic eliminates the possibility of a Triple Crown Victory for Tiz the Law, which won the Belmont Stakes in a commanding performance in June.

The Kentucky Derby, traditionally the first race in the Triple Crown, ran four months later than usual, and without paying spectators, due to precautions taken in the coronavirus pandemic.

Tiz the Law had been the heavy favorite at 3/5 odds, while Authentic was at 8 to 1.
