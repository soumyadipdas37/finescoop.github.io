Dani Donato won a torturous endurance competition to become Head of Household on Sunday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars and nominated Kevin Campbell and David Alexander for eviction.

The one-hour show on CBS opened with an intense endurance challenge to become Head of Household for the upcoming week.

The houseguests were challenged to remain on a billboard promoting the upcoming movie Power Trip as it periodically tilted forward with occasional cold water drenches.

The contestants used hand grips to try to remain against the wall and Da'Vonne Rogers, 32, declared her intention to win after her best friend Bayleigh Dayton, 27, was evicted.

Da'Vonne, however, was the first to be eliminated and also became a Have-Not for the week.

She was followed off the wall by David, 30, and Ian Terry, 29, who both joined Da'Vonne as Have-Not houseguests.

Dani, 34, was intent on lasting longer than Tyler Crispen, 25, who wronged her even though they are both members of The Committee six-person alliance.

She not only beat out Tyler but also everyone else and won the Head of Household competition and the right to nomimate two houseguests for eviction.

David realized he could be a target, but he also was holding the Disruptor power that allows him to remove someone up for eviction, including himself.

'I have told no one about my power and I don't intend to,' David said.

Kevin, 40, also figured he would be nominated as he described Dani as being a 'stone statue' with him.

Da'Vonne talked to Dani and tried to convince her to put Christmas Abbott, 38, up for eviction along with Tyler.

Cody Calafiore, 29, meanwhile urged Dani to put Kevin up for eviction.

She complained that Tyler was coming after her and Cody jokingly suggested she also put him on the block.

'Just kidding. Don't put him on the block. Put him on the block, he'll win the veto,' Cody warned her of Tyler.

Tyler also spoke to Dani to check in on her plans.

'I won't be mad at you if you put me up. Or backdoor me, because I know I deserve it at this point,' Tyler said.

'Shut up, Tyler,' replied Dani.

Dani admitted in a confessional that she was torn about her decision.

'Tyler was putting himself on my radar for last couple of weeks. And now I'm in a position where I can come after him, but if I come after Tyler, there's an opportunity for him to really hurt my game. So the big question is, do I take the shot this week or not?,' Dani said.

Dani later told her fellow alliance member Nicole Franzel, 28, that she was going to put Kevin and David up for nomination, but also was considering a backdoor move to eliminate Tyler.

'I don't trust him at all,' Dani told Nicole, who was against targeting their alliance member Tyler.

Kevin met with Dani who stood by her strategy of trying to convince him that he was pawn and not an actual target.

Dani swore that she would 'never, ever' want him out of the house.

She also sought insurance from Tyler and they both agreed not to target each other until only their alliance members remained.

'Tyler is the type of person, if you're going to swing, you can't miss,' Dani said in a confessional as she continued to weigh her options.

Dani during the nomination ceremony revealed that she put Kevin and David up for eviction.

'I nominated Kevin and David because they're the only two people in the house I don't talk the game with,' Dani said.

Kevin was disappointed to be a 'pawn' again and was feeling disposable.

David, meanwhile, was holding onto his Disruptor power.

'It's time to disrupt this house,' David said.

Big Brother All-Stars will return Tuesday on CBS.
