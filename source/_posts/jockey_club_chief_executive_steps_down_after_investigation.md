The group chief executive of The Jockey Club is standing down after a review found evidence of bullying and racist comments.

Delia Bushell was one of 19 witnesses interviewed as part of a review into allegations about her conduct - reportedly made by a senior member of the executive board.

The findings made it 'untenable' for her to stay in the role, the organisation's board said.

The former BT Sport and Sky executive was one of the most powerful figures in British race horsing after she took over the 270-year-old organisation less than a year ago.  

The Jockey Club, which owns a number of high profile horseracing tracks including Aintree, Cheltenham, Epsom and Newmarket, said an independent barrister had submitted a detailed report to a sub-committee of the board last week.

That sub-committee, which includes Tory peer Dido Harding – who is in charge of the NHS Test and Trace system – decided there was a basis for disciplinary action against Ms Bushell including on the grounds of gross misconduct.

In a statement, the Jockey Club said: 'The Board of The Jockey Club announces today that Delia Bushell is to stand down as Group Chief Executive with immediate effect.

'This follows the completion of an independent review into a wide range of allegations about her conduct, which the Board concluded made it untenable for her to continue in the role.

'As part of this review, an independent barrister interviewed 19 witnesses including Delia. He submitted a detailed report to a sub-committee of the Board comprising Dido Harding, Julia Budd and Justin Dowley on Sunday 23rd August in which he concluded that there was evidence to support a number of the allegations of misconduct including bullying behaviour towards colleagues, inappropriate racist comments and sharing offensive materials.

'The sub-committee of the Board agreed with his conclusion and decided that there was a basis for disciplinary action against Delia including on the grounds of gross misconduct. This recommendation was accepted by the full Board of The Jockey Club.'

Nevin Truesdale has been appointed as acting group chief executive, the club said.

Bushell is also a non-executive director of the England and Wales Cricket Board and sits on the advisory board of the Telegraph Media Group. 

She has previously made it clear that she wanted to modernise the Jockey Club, by bringing a more commercial edge to the racing body, diversifying revenue streams and cutting costs.

Speaking about the club in March, she said: 'Because it has been so large and so successful for so long, it probably felt that it hasn't needed to draw a broader and more diverse audience.' 

The Jockey Club owns 15 racecourses, including Aintree, which hosts the Grand National, and Epsom Downs, home of the Derby. 

The body expects to lose £75m in turnover due to Covid-19.
