Britain's Got Talent returned with a twist over the weekend as the semi-finals saw contestants perform with a socially-distanced format.

And bosses have reportedly banned the show's new virtual audience from boozing at home in a bid to avoid offensive pranks. 

According to insiders, the observers have been ordered to be on their best behaviour while watching the exciting episodes unfold online.

A source told The Sun: 'The bosses want to minimise the risk of anyone having too many drinks and doing something naughty on national TV.

'Another rule is that they can only be seen on screen from the waist up.'

MailOnline has contacted Britain's Got Talent representatives for further comment. 

On Saturday, fans compared the new set-up to an episode of Black Mirror titled Fifteen Million Merits, which famously spoofed the talent show format by featuring character taking part in the show Hot Shot.

Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly are hosting the weekly episodes, while Amanda Holden, David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Ashley Banjo - who is filling in for Simon Cowell as he recovers from his back injury - take to the panel.   

Dancer Ashley, 31, has hit back at 'hateful' trolls after being bombarded with messages following Diversity's Black Lives Matter-inspired routine at the first semi-finals.

The series received more than 1,000 complaints from viewers after the popular dance troupe took to the stage with a routine in support of the movement.

Choreographer Ashley took to Twitter to insist that trolls 'highlighted exactly what needed to change' after his set left fans claiming the show was 'making a political statement.'

The media personality also thanked supporters for their praise and supportive messages following the raw production. 

He tweeted: 'So much to say... But I’ll Just let the performance talk. Thousands of messages of Love and support - Thank you.

'For the thousands of messages of hate and ignorance - Thank you. You highlight exactly what needs to change. Sending nothing but love to you all.'
