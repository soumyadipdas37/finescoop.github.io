Cristiano Ronaldo may be ruled out of Portugal's upcoming Nations League fixtures after picking up an infection in his right foot. 

The Juventus ace had been hoping to lead the line for the double-header against Croatia and Sweden over the next few days, but is now receiving treatment with an antibiotic to deal with the issue.  

Ronaldo's absence from training on Thursday was announced by the Portuguese FA, and it is believed that the forward's involvement in both European clashes is now at risk.

After being confined to gym work on Wednesday, Ronaldo faces a battle to prove he has shaken off the infection and will now be evaluated on a day-to-day basis by medical staff. 

The 35-year-old will certainly be fit in time to begin the new Serie A campaign under Andrea Pirlo on September 20, however.

Juventus will begin their title defence, and their new era, against Sampdoria.  

Due to the injury not affecting Ronaldo's muscles or bones, it is understood that Juventus are not overtly worried by their talisman's condition.

The Portugal talisman may be forced to wait for his 100th international goal due to his setback

The club will contact Portugal to be kept updated on his progress. 

A further source of frustration for Ronaldo will be his potential failure to score his 100th international goal in either of the two games. 

His 99th strike came against Luxembourg in November, and the superstar's wait may now stretch even further.  

Portugal play Croatia on Saturday and will then travel to Sweden on Tuesday.
