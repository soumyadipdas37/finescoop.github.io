Ashley Darby opened up to her Real Housewives Of Potomac co-stars about consensually engaging in 'threesomes' with husband Michael, 59.

'Michael and I have been in situations where we have been with other people before,' admitted the 32-year-old in a preview for Sunday's episode of the hit Bravo show. 

The admission comes after series regulars Gizelle Bryant and Candiace Dillard unveiled that Michael was allegedly with several strippers, telling people he had a wife and a boyfriend, and apparently trying to 'hook up.'

Ashley added that her and Michael's 'marriage has had its own identity.'

After shocking the room with her candidness, Darby went on to provide an example of a memorable threesome she partook in at a David Guetta concert. 

'For example, we were hanging out at the David Guetta concert and, you know, I saw someone that I was attracted to and...' she said before trailing off, insinuating that the attraction led to a threesome.

Monique Samuels, 36, not content with Ashley's subtly, asked her directly if her and Michael 'had a threesome' with the unnamed woman at the concert.

Say what? 'For example, we were hanging out at the David Guetta concert and, you know, I saw someone that I was attracted to and...' she said before trailing off, insinuating that the attraction led to a threesome

'Yes,' she replied coyly. This prompted the entire room to erupt in further shock and loud, jumbled chatter. 

'It was two guys?' asked Monique, to which Darby clarified: 'No, it was a girl.' 

In her confessional, Karen Huger, 57, said that, although she 'appreciates Ashley talking [to the group]' about the complexities of her and Michael's marriage, it came as no surprise to anyone.

'We already filled in the blanks. I know I have and I am ok with it.'

A girl: 'It was two guys?' asked co-star Monique Samuels, 36, to which Darby clarified: 'No, it was a girl' 

With cheating allegations at play, Huger attempted to clarify the state of Ashley's marriage for the rest of the group. 

'Are you in a monogamous place right now? Because I feel that you are,' asked Karen.

Ashley insisted that she 'doesn't want anything with anybody else' and if Michael is caught in anymore infidelity-related drama that she is 'done.'

Ashley, who already shares son Dean with Michael, revealed last week on her Instagram that she's expecting her second child with the politician. 

On last week's episode of the Real Housewives Of Potomac, Candiace and Gizelle came forth with text messages that alleged that Michael was with several strippers, telling people he had a wife and a boyfriend, and apparently trying to hook up, despite being married.

After looking at the messages on Candiace's phone, Ashley handed it back and asked if her source was credible, to which Candiace replied she was a very good friend. 

Candiace then asked Ashley how directly she asks her husband about his actions.

Ashley replied 'I don't just ask questions, Candiace. I reads emails, text messages, I sniff underwear, everything.' 

Ashley ultimately assured Candiace and Gizelle that she would address the text messages with Michael.

'So, I will take this information. I hear what you're saying. I will talk to my husband about it,' Ashley shared.'I will get to the bottom of it, and I will see if there's some truth to it.'

The rumors are nothing new for Ashley as Michael said he would stop going to strip clubs after he allegedly came home smelling like perfume several months ago.

She opened up about a past occurrence that took place with Michael when he returned home from a strip club, an incident that Candiace obtained pictures of to show Ashley. 

Ashley said that she and her spouse 'talked about the issue that Candiace brought up, and he told me he was at the strip club and this woman kept touching him.'

She said that tensions ran high and they slept in separate rooms, 'Michael slept in the baby's room and I slept in the bedroom.'

She said her husband 'regrets' his actions, which he didn't specify, and 'feels bad' about it.

Taking it up with him: 'So, I will take this information. I hear what you're saying. I will talk to my husband about it,' Ashley shared.'I will get to the bottom of it, and I will see if there's some truth to it'

On the show, Candiace, 33, said she'd received pictures of Michael 'in his boxers' at a hotel. Gizelle, 50, told Candiace, 'I'm minding my business and I had at least 40 DMs about Michael; this is the worst!'

Candiace said there was now 'photographic evidence of Michael at a hotel, Michael at the strip club and Michael at MGM.'

Aside from infidelity, a cameraman on their reality series publicly claimed in 2018 that Michael had groped him during filming. 

Charges of felony assault and misdemeanor improper sexual conduct were filed against Michael but later dropped due to a lack of evidence.

'When I got the news, I just froze,' Ashley while delving into the matter. 'It was not real that something like this was happening to my husband and I. My heart was racing, I was getting light headed. Like, this just can’t be my reality.'

Last year, Michael was alleged to have made a sexual comment about one of Housewives' husbands.

'After the night died down, Michael walked past us and said, "Yeah, I would suck his d***,''' Dixon told Ashley on the show. 'You were there. You all were walking past us.'

Despite one of her fellow Housewives claiming Michael said it, Ashley adamantly denied he'd made the comment.

The Real Housewives of Potomac can be seen on Bravo Sunday at 9/8c.
