Stacey Hampton gave fans a glimpse at her rarely seen stomach tattoo in a post on Instagram on Thursday.

The 26-year-old former Married At First Sight star showed off the detailed inking as she posed precariously on a ledge wearing nothing but a white bikini.

'Suns out, buns out. I hope you're all having an amazing Thursday. I'm taking my son to my mums [sic] for a swim,' she captioned the photo.

Although Stacey was perched side-on on what looked like a second storey ledge, there was no missing the large tattoo on her torso.

Clinging onto a railing, the former reality star flashed a peace sign as she posed for the camera, a pair of oversize sunglasses shielding her eyes from the sun.

In a YouTube video back in April, Stacey revealed that she got the eye-catching tattoo as a tribute to her late brother.

'My stomach tattoo is very sentimental. When my brother died, I was pregnant with my firstborn. So after he was born I got a tribute on my stomach,' she explained.

She confessed people will often ask her about the intricate tattoo, even though she tries to 'hide' it. 

The tattoo features a geometric design, with her brother's name scrawled in the middle, above the words 'forever young'.

Stacey explained that she's self-conscious about the tattoo because it's so deeply personal, and admitted she tries to keep it covered up.

'I may or may not post a close-up one day, but it's very sentimental to me. Even with bikinis, I'll wear a one-piece or put a sarong over it,' she added. 

Stacey is a single mum to two young sons, Kosta, five, and Kruz, three.
