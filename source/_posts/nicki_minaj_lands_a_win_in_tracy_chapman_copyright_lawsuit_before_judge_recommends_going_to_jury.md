Nicki Minaj has landed a significant win in a copyright lawsuit brought against her by Tracy Chapman.

A judge ruled Wednesday that the 10-time Grammy nominee did not commit copyright infringement in her song based on Chapman's Baby Can I Hold You.

US district judge Virginia A Phillips found that her use of the song constitutes 'fair use,' protecting a common practice in the music industry of developing new music based on existing work, and requesting license from the original artist before release.

Judge Phillips wrote: 'Artists usually experiment with works before seeking licenses from rights holders and rights holders typically ask to see a proposed work before approving a license.

'A ruling uprooting these common practices would limit creativity and stifle innovation within the music industry.'

Minaj based her 2017 track Sorry (featuring Nasir Bin Olu) off Chapman's song from her 1988 self-titled debut album.

Her representatives sought permission from Chapman, who repeatedly refused, citing a blanket policy she has against such licensing.

Portions of the song later played on The Breakfast Club, and it's since become widely available online.

Chapman accused Minaj of providing DJ Flex with the track, but she and Flex have both denied it come from her or her representatives.

The Pink Friday artist's legal team argued that artists should be free to create work based on existing material, without fearing legal action from the original artist when pursuing license.

The attorney stated: 'Such free-flowing creativity is important to all recording artists, but particularly in hip hop.

'With that category of music, a recording artist typically goes into the studio and experiments with dozens of different ‘beats’ or snippets of melodies, before hitting upon a pleasing combination.'

Although the judge agreed, she ruled that the dispute over whether Minaj provided the music to DJ Flex would need to go to jury.
