Sharon Stone nearly had to evacuate her Beverly Hills mansion on Tuesday.

The 62-year-old Basic Instinct actress told Jimmy Kimmel that there was a fire on her street that was so serious that she told her sons to pack their bags. And because she lives in a cul-de-sac there was concern they would not get out safely.

'I was just in tears yesterday,' she said. 'There was a fire on her street and we were preparing to evacuate and say goodbye to everything.'  

Scary: Sharon Stone nearly had to evacuate her Beverly Hills mansion on Tuesday she told Jimmy Fallon

Her lair: The 62-year-old Basic Instinct actress said there was a fire on her street that was so serious that she told her sons to pack their bags. And because she lives in a cul-de-sac there was concern they would not get out safely

She told her kids to take their computer, one pair of shoes and a sweater each.

'We had to be ready and make sure the cars have gas,' added the siren.

She added there are 600 fires in California and the smoke is overwhelming. 'It's raining ash even in the house, this is what we're breathing,' she noted.

'We have to be happy in the face of disaster, it's all we have,' said the Casino star who wore a black mock turtleneck and dangling gold earrings. 

She laughed when Jimmy said he wanted to talk about something happier.

He added the were in a movie together, They Year Of Getting To Know Us, and Sharon played his mom.

Stressful! 'I was just in tears yesterday,' she said. 'There was a fire on her street and we were preparing to evacuate and say goodbye to everything'

Too much! She told her kids to take their computer, one pair of shoes and a sweater each. 'We had to be ready and make sure the cars have gas,' added the siren

 Jimmy said her mother was thrilled that Stone played her. 'You were so nice to me and great, I loved being around you. You are real,' he added.

Jimmy noted she is getting rave reviews for her role in Ratched and mentioned that Ryan Murphy wrote the role with Sharon in mind but she said that gives her pause because the character is 'nuts.'    

This comes after Sharon talked to the October cover of Town & Country magazine.

Burning Cali: She added there are 600 fires in California and the smoke is overwhelming. 'It's raining ash even in the house, this is what we're breathing,' she noted

In the wide-ranging interview, the former model talks about how she is still asked to take her clothes off, how she feels for what Marilyn Monroe went through and that time when a director sexually harassed her by insisting she sit on his lap.

Stone did not offer too many details about her sexual harassment story with the unnamed director - who denied the story to the publication.

But she did convey the tension well. 

On a lighter note: Jimmy noted she is getting rave reviews for her role in Ratched and mentioned that Ryan Murphy wrote the role with Sharon in mind but she said that gives her pause because the character is 'nuts'

She sure has some house: The activist by the swimming pool of her massive home

'He’d tell me that I should sit on his lap to get direction for the scene,' said Stone.

Stone discussed being a sex symbol in Town & Country, from still being asked to show off her body at 62 to being sexually harassed at the height of her career

'And when I told him that I was not going to sit on his lap, he would send me back to the trailer. And that is just the way it was.'

The incident took place when she was 'at the height of her earning power,' the magazine explained. Stone reportedly made her most money for Basic Instinct 2 in 2006 with over $13M.

Her sex symbol image still lingers, which surprises the veteran.

'People still want to see my boobs. I’m 62! It’s like, "Really? Grow up!" But also, "Here’s some boobs!"' she said with a theatrical gesture.

As far as how she came to fame in the early Nineties, she says the public wanted a pinup.

'People, I guess, really needed a sex symbol,' said the Pennsylvania native.

An icon: When playing cunning author Catherine Trammel in 1992's Basic Instinct, Sharon showed off a cold, calculated sexuality

The star said she was sexually harassed on set by a director. It took place at the height of her success; seen here in Basic Instinct 2 in 2006 with David Morrissey

'I mean, I never thought I was that sexy... When I did Basic Instinct, I explored my dark side and made friends with my dark side. I got to not be afraid of my own self. I think people find that sexy.'

But having people expect her to be a sex symbol all the time is taxing. 

'It was very difficult for Marilyn Monroe. She did movies that really mattered, like Bus Stop, The Misfits, but she still couldn’t get completely out of being that thing. It’s very hard to shake,' said the mother of three.

There was also a time when Sharon was hardly employed because of the old Hollywood rules that still apply.

'You don’t really get work between 40 and 60. It doesn’t matter if you’re at the height of your career, whether you just made Casino. That’s it: no work,' said the movie queen. 

Casino came out in 1995. 

And now Stone is not letting being 62 get in her way of landing jobs.

'I think you have to choose how you want to age. People look at me as a certain thing, and it gets in the way of them casting me as things I could play,' she said.

'But I’m sure that I have my own destiny, and I’m now trying to meet it with as much integrity as I can, and be as open to growth as I can be.'

A fabulous character: Playing Lenore Osgood in Ratched has been a thrill for her. 'She’s completely insane,' says Stone with a sly smile. 'And at the same time she thinks she’s really a loving mother who has her sh*t together'

A criminal: To help with her role, Sharon thought out the character's back story. 'I thought she was probably Doris Duke’s best friend—she was a showgirl who married some rich guy and knocked him off,' she said

Playing Lenore Osgood in Ratched has been a thrill for her. 'She’s completely insane,' says Stone with a sly smile. 'And at the same time she thinks she’s really a loving mother who has her sh*t together.'

Stone has something very big to look forward to in 2021: she is releasing her memoir The Beauty Of Living Twice 

To help with her role, Sharon thought out the character's back story. 

'I thought she was probably Doris Duke’s best friend—she was a showgirl who married some rich guy and knocked him off,' she said.

'She would try to be fancy, because the more fabulous she was the less people would know that she came from nowhere and was a complete criminal.' 

Also in the interview, Sharon talked money.

She said she made less than $500,000 for her role in Basic Instinct and co-star Michael Douglas made much more; some reports say as much as $15M.

And even when her star rose, she had to fight to get a good paycheck.

'When I was a global phenomenon and I wanted to make $2 million [for a movie], it was like I wanted them to give me the moon, like I’d lost all reason,' said the Sliver star.

'When I wanted four, they were like, "We’re not going to pay you $4 million for this movie."' 

Stone has something very big to look forward to in 2021: she is releasing her memoir The Beauty Of Living Twice as she discusses not just her career and marriages but also her near-death experience in 2001.

Stone’s cover shoot, pictured, took place at Dawnridge, the house that serves as her character's home in the series—and the former home of her friend Tony Duquette.
