ModiBodi has released an advertisement featuring shots of real period blood to normalise the stigma around women's menstrual cycles.

The Australian label is the country's number one selling leak-proof underwear brand, providing sustainable and environmentally friendly options for women.

The latest campaign titled 'The New Way To Period' promotes the label's mission to 'replace fear and shame with understanding and encourage sustainable alternatives', along with breaking down taboos regarding women's periods.

Research undertaken by Modibodi shows almost one in three young girls are afraid of talking about periods, and so the brand hopes to change this.

The campaign champions raw confidence, celebrates individual freedom, embraces diversity and encourages women to step towards a more sustainable future.

Shot and directed by award-winning Sydney-based director Dani Pearce, the one-minute script follows the journey of multiple women, each with their own nuance and story as they embrace the new way to period. 

'When it comes to our period, we've always been made to feel a certain way. We've been made to feel gross,' the video's narrator said and shows a bed sheet hanging out of a washing machine with a circular red blood stain.

Another shot shows a bin overflowing with tissues that are also blood-stained and a woman washing her ModiBodi underwear in the shower.

Modibodi CEO and Founder Kristy Chong said: 'Advertising for personal hygiene products has come a long way in the seven years since we started Modibodi; but many brands still feel the need to hide or gloss over the very natural process of having your period.'

'We've used red to represent blood from day one. The New Way to Period shows the real side of menstruation and reminds women they're allowed to feel however they want when they have their period and that there are better options than eco-damaging disposable pads, liners and tampons.

'We hope this film opens the viewers mind to a new period experience. It's the twenty-first century and Modibodi's sustainable, leak-proof underwear and apparel is here to help people feel comfortable, confident and fiercely themselves,' she said.

'Great ad, love that you show red blood,' another said, a third added: 'So good and important.'

'Bravo to this incredible, ground breaking organisation! Not just offering better, more sustainable options for our periods, but helping to break the taboo and shame associated with what is a natural part of our lives as women,' a fourth said.

Emotive Creative Director, Jardin Anderson, said: 'It's been a pleasure to help herald in 'the new way to period' with a brand bold enough to lean into the beauty of normality and eschew all the hyperbole so often seen in this category.

'Director Dani Pearce understood straight away the tone we wanted to achieve and was the perfect person to bring this story to life.' 

The brand hopes the advertisement will make a change and 'navigate a new direction' regarding how periods are perceived and discussed.
