New video footage has revealed the moments right after a gunman opened fire on police officers in Louisville during violent demonstrations on Wednesday, as protesters there took to the streets for a third night in a row and claimed sanctuary in a church.

The footage shows a man in a multicolored hoodie waving a handgun wildly, after reaching over the head of another protester and opening fire in a chaotic scene.

Injured were Major Aubrey Gregory, who was shot in the hip and has been released from the hospital, and Officer Robinson Desroches, who was shot in the abdomen and required emergency surgery, but is expected to survive. 

Larynzo D. Johnson, 26, was arrested at the scene and charged with 14 counts of wanton endangerment and two counts of assault on a police officer. Police say he was armed with a handgun and was identified by witnesses as the shooter.

The shootings occurred during the first night of protests over the grand jury decision not to directly charge officers in the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor during a search warrant raid in March.

The suspected gunman who shot two Louisville police officers is seen in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Wednesday night. Police identified him as 26-year-old Larynzo D. Johnson

Police are seen taking Johnson into custody soon after the shooting. Cops say he was armed with a handgun, and was identified by witnesses as the gunman who opened fire and injured two officers

One witness to the shooting of the officers has now come forward, saying that police deployed a flash-bang to deploy the crowd, and another protester came up behind him and opened fire just feet away.

'I heard two gun shots right behind me, I turned around, this all happened within a second or two,' the witness, who asked not to be named, told WLKY-TV.

'I saw the shooter wearing a bright tie-dye hoodie. He was shooting directly at the police and fired about 2 or 3 shots while running then fired more shots then ran down the alley way 44,' he said. 

The Jefferson County Office of the Commonwealth's Attorney tells DailyMail.com that it's possible the charges could be upgraded to attempted murder, if the facts support it. 

On Friday night, the unrest over the grand jury decision in the Taylor case entered a third night in Louisville and other cities across the nation, with demonstrators in Louisville claiming 'sanctuary' at a church after a 9pm curfew went into effect.

More than 100 people gathered at the First Unitarian Church, where clergy invited them to avoid arrest by using an exemption for churches in the city's emergency curfew order.

Some of the demonstrators chanted 'say her name, Breonna Taylor' and 'You can't stop the revolution.'

The stone Gothic-style church was built in the late 19th century and is known for its progressive ideology. A large Black Lives Matter banner hangs outside it. 

Video from the scene shows church members preparing a sumptuous buffet for the crowd, as demonstrators mingled inside and outside the church.

Some of the Black Lives Matter supporters inside of the church were armed with tactical shotguns and AR-15-style rifles, video shows. 

Shortly before midnight, police surrounded the church with guns drawn. A church leader said police had arrived after reports of an armed militia in the area, referring to the armed Black Lives Matter supporters.

Police withdrew after the clergy member advised them that the armed demonstrators had permission to be on church grounds. 

Other video from Louisville shows roving bands of protesters out after curfew confronting a business owner whose small business was firebombed the previous night. Tonight, he stood guard outside with a long gun.

The protesters demanded that the business owner say the words 'black lives matter,' but he declined, responding 'If you're a good person, I'm ok. If you're a bad person...' he trailed off, shrugging. 

The exchange grew heated as the band of protesters berated the man, who responded: 'I don't care about white, black, green, purple, whatever the f*** it is.'

'I don't see color, I don't believe in color. I'm part Filipino,' the business owner added, video shows.

After midnight on Friday, protesters had largely dispersed from downtown, with no major confrontations with police. 

Protesters have been marching in Louisville and other cities after a grand jury decided to bring no charges against Louisville police for the killing of Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot after cops returned fire when her boyfriend shot and injured an officer during a drug raid. 

At a Friday news conference, family attorney Ben Crump called for the release of grand jury transcripts and relatives of Taylor criticized Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. 

Also Friday, a not guilty plea was entered in court for Larynzo Johnson, who is accused of shooting and wounding two police officers during protests after the grand jury announcement. 

In New York City, hundreds of demonstrators shut down lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge on Friday night, sitting and refusing to move for over an hour.
