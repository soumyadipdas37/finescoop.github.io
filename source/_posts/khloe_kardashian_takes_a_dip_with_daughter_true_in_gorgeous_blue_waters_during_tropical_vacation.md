Khloé Kardashian hasn't been taking the news well, regarding the recent cancellation of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

But the Good American mogul has her family to keep a smile on her face, as they bid farewell to a cultural phenomenon.

She was ever the doting mom Friday, as she took to Instagram with some throwbacks of herself taking a dip with daughter True in some gorgeous blue waters from a recent tropical vacation.

The 36-year-old sported some chunky shades while holding her daughter, two, above the crystal clear surface, writing: 'Turquoise Water and TuTu'

She previously shared a photo of herself and the toddler sharing a smooch on the beach, as they matched in zebra-print swimsuits.

Khloé also took her baby girl for a mother/daughter sunset horseback ride through the sand during their getaway.

Earlier this week, sister Kim announced the end of KUWTK on Instagram, writing in part: 'It is with heavy hearts that we’ve made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years.'     

Khloé posted the statement to her own Instagram, adding: 'I am so grateful and thankful to everyone who has supported us and been there through it all. 

'I’m too emotional to fully express myself at the moment. My sappy post will come soon. Change is hard but also needed at times. I love you all. Thank you for the memories!'

A source recently told The Sun: 'The family have been locked in an ongoing debate over the future of the show for months now.'

They revealed that Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian forced momager Kris Jenner's hand in cancelling the show, as they both wanted to focus more on their own families.

Emotional response: Kris, 64, later revealed: 'Khloé is the one who is taking it the hardest and hasn’t stopped crying since we announced'

The insider added: 'The only people who are upset are Khloé and Scott Disick. Khloe’s tried to launch several spin-off shows - but none of them have been as successful as KUWTK.'

Kris, 64, later revealed on On Air with Ryan Seacrest: 'We had to tell the crew yesterday, so we were all crying, but I think Khloé. Khloé is the one who is taking it the hardest and hasn’t stopped crying since we announced.

'She's been so sweet and emotional about it. But there is so much more life yet to live and we're going to have the best time doing what we do.'

Khloé and her famous family have starred on the show since it premiered in 2007, launching several spin-offs, as well as the Kardashian/Jenner pop culture obsession.
