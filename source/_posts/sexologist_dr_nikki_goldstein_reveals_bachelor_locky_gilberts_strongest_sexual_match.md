Bachelor Locky Gilbert has not been holding back when it comes to exploring his attraction with the ladies vying for his heart.

And Australian sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein revealed who she thinks the rugged heart throb has the strongest sexual chemistry with, ahead of the show's grand finale.

She told Daily Mail Australia: 'When it comes to sexual chemistry I think Bec [Cvilikas] wins that match.'

While his relationship with Bella Veralis appears to have sparks flying, Dr Nikki said, 'their romance feels more like a high school romance than one of sexual passion and fire'.

She also added that Locky's affectionate nature makes picking the winning lady a complex task, saying: 'His connections with the girls do differ.

'It doesn't mean he will pick a winner based on sexual chemistry alone, but between him and Bec you can see it's there.

'From the moment he saw her, it wasn't that he was just taken by her or thought she was beautiful, you could see clearly he was very attracted to her.'

While sexual tensions between the Bachelor and the ladies may arise, there is a strict no sex rule on the show. 

Dr Nikki said that while 'sexual compatibility is an important factor in a relationship', the show's 'family friendly' format makes choosing someone based on non-sexual interactions difficult.

'On one hand, it's nice to get to know someone, but we do need to accept that it's [sex] a factor for many.

'It's not easy to have a physically intimate moment with someone when there are cameras watching and other people you are dating to consider,' she added.

In terms of who could be the winning lady, Dr Nikki said: 'I really think it could be any of the girls.

Dates: In terms of who could be the winning lady, Dr Nikki said: 'I really think it could be any of the girls. He seems to have a closer bond with the girls than previous Bachelors and really seems to be actively dating all of them'. Pictured is Locky and Bella 

'He seems to have a closer bond with the girls than previous Bachelors and really seems to be actively dating all of them. No one would surprise me.'
