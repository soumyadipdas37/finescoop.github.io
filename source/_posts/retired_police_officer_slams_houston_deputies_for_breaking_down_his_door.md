A retired police officer in Texas has called deputies' behavior unprofessional after they broke down the door to his home on a warrant for someone who did not live there.

Louis Rodriguez and his son began filming at their home in Houston on September 1 when Harris County deputies demanded entry and said they had a warrant for the arrest of Curtis Rogers.

'The officers are looking for a Curtis Rogers in this house and there is no Curtis Rogers that lives in this house,' said Louis Rodriguez's son in the video.

Rodriguez said that at first he was wasn't certain whether the people outside were real police officers, and refused to open the door and asked to see a warrant, according to KTRK-TV.

Soon after they began filming, the deputies broke down the door with a battering ram. 

'They went that quickly to bust my front door down and come to my home,' said Rodriguez, a retired police officer. 

'Out of control yelling, demanding, threatening they wanted to come in. I wasn't sure they were police officers at the time,' he said. 

Rodriguez told the deputies he was a retired officer and asked to see their warrant, but instead they detained him and his son and took them outside.

'(They) manhandled myself and my son and brought us outside. (Then) they finally realized the mistake they made,' he said.

The mistaken raid occurred in this suburban neighborhood of Houston

A captain on the scene apologized when the deputies realized their mistake, but Rodriguez said the apology was not sufficient.

In a statement, the Harris County Sheriff's Department said: 'Deputies attempting to execute an arrest warrant on Sept. 1 mistakenly approached the wrong home in the 21100 block of Royal Villa Drive and damaged the front door.'

'Deputies subsequently realized they made a mistake and the sheriff's office arranged to have the door replaced. The sheriff's office regrets the mistake and the incident is under review,' the statement continued.

Although nobody was injured in the incident, Rodriguez said he is disappointed in what happened and plans to file a complaint with the sheriff's office.

'I'd hate for this to happen to any family in Harris County,' he told the local ABC affiliate.
