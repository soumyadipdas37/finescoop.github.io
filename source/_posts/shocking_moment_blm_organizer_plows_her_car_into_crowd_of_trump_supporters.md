A Black Lives Matter organizer has been arrested after video showed her driving a car into a crowd of Trump supporters in southern California, injuring two. 

Driver Tatiana Turner, 40, of Long Beach was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon following the incident on Saturday in the city of Yorba Linda, about 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

The shocking scene unfolded as about 150 people gathered, some with a group called Caravan4Justice supporting Black Lives Matter, and others to stage a counter-protest supporting President Donald Trump nearby.  

Federal records show that Turner filed a trademark application for Caravan4Justice in July, and a GoFundMe campaign names her as the group's 'founder'.

Deputies were on the scene to maintain peace and quickly arrested the driver

The incident occurred as members of Black Lives Matter demonstrated against police brutality and systemic racism.

Counter-protesters crossed six-lane Imperial Highway and confronted the BLM protesters, authorities said. The protesters also confronted each other in the parking lot of the Yorba Linda public library, Braun said.

A white sedan came went through the crowd in the parking lot or the exit of the parking lot at the public library, injuring two people, Braun said. People chased the car as it tried to drive away, and it was eventually stopped and was surrounded by police, she said.

The Register reported it was not known how fast the car was going. The back windshield had been broken out, and it had a flagpole sticking out of it. The front windshield was smashed, the Register reported.

Members of Caravan4Justice are seen at a rally in June. Turner is the founder of the group, according to trademark filings and a GoFundMe campaign

The female driver of the car was detained, Braun said.

Braun said there were 300 people total and at some point it was declared an unlawful assembly and dispersal orders were given.

On Thursday night, a BLM protester was struck by a pickup truck during a march in Hollywood and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Los Angeles police said Friday the preliminary investigation found that the driver was attempting to maneuver through the crowd when protesters began beating the vehicle with sticks and attempted to open the door.

The driver was attempting to drive away from the situation when he struck the protester. The driver stopped several blocks away and cooperated with officers. He was released pending the outcome of the investigation.
