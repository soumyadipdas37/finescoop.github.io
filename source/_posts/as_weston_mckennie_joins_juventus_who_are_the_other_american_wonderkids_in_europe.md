Two years ago, the United States national team lost 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago in a World Cup qualifier, thereby failing to qualify for the men's version of the tournament for the first time since 1986.

It was total humiliation for Team USA, then managed by Bruce Arena, with the Trinidad defeat branded as the worst in the history of US soccer. But since then, a brand new crop of exciting American youngsters have come through the ranks and have started to have an impact on the major European stage.

With Team USA's 2022 World Cup qualifiers not far away, Sportsmail takes a look at the United States' most exciting young talents starring across Europe...

Christian Pulisic was distraught as Team USA failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia

Christian Pulisic 

Position: Winger/Forward 

Age: 21

Club: Chelsea 

Pulisic has now taken his game to the next level after an impressive season at Chelsea

Christian Pulisic was on the pitch when the USA were humbled by Trinidad and Tobago and looked crestfallen as he couldn't steer his country to the World Cup finals in Russia.

But the winger has taken his game to the next level since then, having recently completed his best ever season in front of goal at Chelsea.

Pulisic netted 11 goals in all competitions during his debut season at Stamford Bridge as the Blues finished in the top-four and also reached the FA Cup final.

The 21-year-old, who has 14 goals in 34 matches for his country, is widely touted as America's best attacking star since Landon Donovan.

Weston McKennie 

Position: Midfielder

Age: 22

Club: Juventus

Weston McKennie is another promising USA youngster - he has joined Juventus this summer

American midfielder Weston McKennie endured a difficult Bundesliga season with mid-table Schalke last term, but the youngster showed enough promise for Juventus to snap him up.

The 22-year-old joined the Serie A champions for an initial £2.5million loan deal, with a £15m option-to-buy at the end of the 2020-21 season. 

McKennie will get the opportunity to learn from ex-midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo during his year in Turin.

At 6ft 1' tall, McKennie is an all-round midfielder who can affect matters in both penalty boxes. He even scored the fastest hat-trick in US international soccer history, scoring three goals in 13 minutes during a CONCACAF Nations League match against Cuba. 

Tyler Adams

Position: Midfielder

Age: 21

Club: RB Leipzig

Tyler Adams scored the winner as RB Leipzig beat Atletico Madrid in the Champions League

Very few people knew Tyler Adams' name when he stepped onto the pitch during RB Leipzig's Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid. By the end of the match, his name was written into RB Leipzig folklore. 

The 21-year-old midfielder showed his attacking qualities by scoring a late winner from range to send the Bundesliga side through to their first ever European semi-final.

It was his first goal for Leipzig since moving from New York Red Bulls in 2018 and his role is expected to grow in the 2020-21 season under Julian Nagelsmann.

He has only been capped 10 times by his country, but a purple patch in Germany will definitely see that number rocket from here.  

Antonee Robinson

Position: Left back

Age: 23

Club: Fulham 

Antonee Robinson's impressive performances for Wigan has seen him earn a move to Fulham

After an impressive spell at Wigan Athletic, defender Antonee Robinson finally got his Premier League move when he joined newly-promoted Fulham for £2m. 

Robinson was part of the Latics side who lost just twice in their final 17 games of the season to finish comfortably in mid-table, but their 12-point deduction meant Wigan were relegated to the third-tier. 

Born in Milton Keynes to an American father, the youngster now has the opportunity to try his hand in the top-flight for Scott Parker's Whites.  

Sergino Dest

Position: Centre back

Age: 19

Club: Ajax  

Defender Sergino Dest has been a rock at the back for Dutch giants Ajax this season

Ajax defender Sergino Dest has helped the Dutch giants soften the blow after Mattijs De Ligt's move to Juventus last summer.

The teenager played 20 times for the Amsterdam club last season and the young defender's stock is continuing to grow. 

Dest chose to represent the States over Holland and was handed his national team debut last September. The 19-year-old could become a key player for both club and country over the coming season.  

Josh Sargent 

Position: Forward

Age: 20

Club: Werder Bremen 

Werdern Bremen forward Josh Sargent netted four goals in four games last season

Missouri-born forward Josh Sargent was picked for the Werder Bremen academy in 2018 after trials at PSV Eindhoven and Bundesliga rivals Schalke. 

The 20-year-old was then called up to the United States men's national team shortly after that and became the fourth-youngest player to score for his country after he netted against Bolivia in May 2018.

Sargent scored four goals and registered four assists for Bremen last season and even laid on a goal during his side's play-off draw with FC Heidenheim to keep them in the top-flight.

Overall, the striker has five goals in 12 games for the US men's national team.
