A suspected neo-Nazi kept an arsenal of explosives at his country home and stored deadly cyanide poison next to the ginger beer and salad cream in his fridge, a court heard.

Counter-terrorism police found large stocks of poisons along with a cache of grenades, mines and explosives after raiding the rural home of Russell Wadge, 58, on Baglan Farm in Trimsaran, Carmarthenshire.    

During their raid of the property, which has an estimated value of £250,000, officers also discovered the farmer's interest in Nazis and white supremacy.

Newport Crown Court heard that Wadge, 'proudly admitted' making hydrogen cyanide described as 'one of the most rapidly acting poisons known to man'.

Tom Little QC, prosecuting, said: 'Hydrogen cyanide was discovered in the freezer, and a pint-glass containing a liquid with a sticker indicating poison was found between the salad cream and ginger beer in the fridge.'

When questioned by police, the married father said he did not believe in any extremism and had a 'keen interest' in chemistry.  

However Mr Little added: 'This is not a case about naive enthusiasm in chemistry - we say it is so much more.

'We need to consider the B-word - Brexit.

'There were those frustrated by the delays to the Brexit process who were agitating, but they did not have access to this range of chemicals.'  

The substances inside Wadge's property included nickel cyanide, hydrogen cyanide, copper potassium cyanide, sodium cooper potassium cyanide and potassium cyanide. 

The jury heard internet searches also showed significant interest in the white supremacist terror attack in New Zealand in 2019.

Suspicions were then raised when Wadge ordered an array of chemicals online to be delivered to his rundown small-holding tucked away in the countryside. 

Wadge is alleged to have been planning to use the weapons 'at some time' in the future.

The jury heard that police also found books describing how to make improvised plastic explosives, three jars of gunpowder and the ingredients to make the 'very dangerous explosive' called triacetone triperoxide TATP - as used in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing- at the property.   

Boxes of grenades, mines and scale drawings of a KGB weapon to deploy hydrogen cyanide were also discovered.

The farmer allegedly told police: 'If it's dodgy or poison, I love it.'     

Wadge denies 28 charges of possessing explosive devices and chemical weapons. He admitted five charges of unlawful possession of poisonous chemicals without a licence.

The trial at Newport Crown Court continues.
