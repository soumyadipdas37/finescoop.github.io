An amateur chef has shared a simple recipe for homemade crispy calamari rings - and all you need is half an hour and six ingredients.

The Australian woman bought some frozen calamari from the fish market and cut it into rings.

She then coated the rings in flour, whisked eggs and 'Panko' breadcrumbs, a Japanese-style breadcrumb perfect for deep-fried foods which is available from Coles for $2 a bag.

She also added salt and 'any spice of your choice' to the mix, before cooking the calamari in her $89 Kmart air fryer for just 11 minutes on 200 degrees Celsius.

'Panko calamari in air fryer last night, tested one first to get the time right,' the woman called Mads posted.

'Flour, egg wash and panko crumb with some salt and spice of choice. 200 degrees, 11 minutes.'

She added: 'Sat them on top of each other and moved around halfway. I really liked it, crunchy and light with the calamari perfectly cooked!'

INGREDIENTS

Many online shared their own versions of delicious calamari

Frozen calamari, cut into rings

Salt

Spice of your choice

Eggs, whisked

Flour

Panko breadcrumbs 

METHOD

1. Cut your frozen calamari into rings.

2. Coat your rings in a mixture of whisked eggs, flour, Panko breadcrumbs, salt and a spice of your choice.

3. Spray the bottom of your air fryer pan with canola oil before you pop your calamari rings in.

4. Cook them on 200 degrees Celsius for 11 minutes, with each ring sitting on top of each other. Move them halfway through.

Hundreds of people who saw Mads' recipe were impressed with the results, and said they couldn't wait to try similar for themselves.

'Thanks so much for the idea. I bought a bag of calamari last week so will try it this weekend,' one commenter posted.

'They look delicious, I love calamari - you did a great job,' another added.

Others made their own suggestions for improving the breadcrumb mix, including garlic and grated Parmesan cheese.

This isn't the first deep-fried food home cooks have enjoyed making in their Kmart air fryers.

Earlier this year, another woman shared how she made halloumi fries in a similar way, by coating thick strips of cheese in flour followed by whisked egg and 'Panko' breadcrumbs. 

Once the cheese was firmly coated, she left it to cook in an air fryer at 200 degrees Celsius for roughly 10 minutes until the outside turned crisp and golden.

She used a 5.3 litre air fryer which is available from Kmart for $89, but the discount retailer also stocks cheaper versions including a 1.5 litre for $49 and a 3.2 litre for $69.
