This is the adorable moment a baby enjoys her first ice cream cone - by diving into it face first! 

The nine-month-old baby, called Emma, seemed to be enjoying the sweet treat as she tries to get as much of the ice cream into her mouth as possible.  

She grabs at the cone with both hands at a Dairy Queen restaurant in the US while being held by her great-grandmother.

Her great-grandmother barely gets a chance to lick the cone before Emma opens her mouth wide and tries to eat some more.   

The baby loves the ice cream so much she plunges into it and ends up with both hands covered in it as she grabs it. 

Emma seems very happy with herself, and waves her arms around in excitement, covering her great-grandmother with the frozen dessert in the process.

The person taking the video is in hysterics at the baby reaching for the cone and trying to bite into it. 

Hungry Emma ends up with ice cream all over her face and drops some on her pink top as she enjoys it.  

The video was taken on June 13, 2017, but has recently resurfaced.
