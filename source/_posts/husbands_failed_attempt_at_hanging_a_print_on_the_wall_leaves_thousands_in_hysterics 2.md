A Kmart customer has shared the amusing mistake her Australian husband made after attempting to hang the popular $19 koala print on their living room wall.

Fiona shared a photo to the Kmart Hacks and Décor Facebook group, revealing her husband Shaun had hung the print upside down so the marsupial looked as though it was hanging from a tree. 

'Ok well I finally got both my [prints] from Kmart and as hubby is working from home got him to hang them… he informed me it's a "drop bear", he had one job,' Fiona said online.

 Should they leave the print as it is?

Fiona said she is originally from the UK and when she and her husband first started dating, he jokingly said koalas are called 'drop bears', but she came to realise this wasn't true.

She teasingly said even the kookaburra in the print beside the koala is questioning her husband's choice.

The social media post gained attention from more than 9,300 others online who were left in stitches over the humorous error.

'So Australian! Wildlife and humour, the two things we are famous for,' one person said.

'Funniest post today!! And it's only 9:35am,' another said, and a third added: 'Very natural position for a hanging bear.'

But many more praised Shaun for his efforts and said the print looked better with the koala positioned upside down.

'I like it! Has a story about it. Great job hubby,' one woman said.

'I love this! You absolutely need to leave it this way!' another said.

'Definitely leave it this way, it is a talking point,' a man said.

Fiona also told Yahoo Lifestyle the prints will remain as they are because it reminds the pair of when they first met a decade ago.

'He always teased me about there being "drop bears" in Australia when we first met 11 years ago so it makes the $19 pic special to us,' she said.
