Hilary Duff has shared her past 'frustrations' at being typecast as Lizzie McGuire and has admitted that finding fame as a teenager was 'isolating'.

The actress, 33, has candidly discussed her role in the hit Disney series and shared new details of the planned reboot in a new interview with Cosmopolitan UK.

Hilary soared to fame as a young teenager in 2001 when she landed the role of 13-year-old Lizzie in the hit sitcom, a character she portrayed until 2004. 

Candid: Hilary Duff has shared her past 'frustrations' at being typecast as Lizzie McGuire and has admitted that finding fame as a teenager was 'isolating' in a new interview with Cosmopolitan UK  

Discussing how she navigated the spotlight as a teen, the actress told the magazine it was 'isolating' and she felt under pressure to be a 'role model'.

Hilary also shared her past 'frustrations' at being typecast as Lizzie McGuire and missing out on roles that were 'truly different'.

After leaving the show, she played the lead in romcoms such as A Cinderella Story, Raise Your Voice, Cheaper By The Dozen and The Perfect Man.  

She told the magazine: 'I'm at such a different place in my life now, being a mother and a wife – it doesn't weigh on me any more.

'I don't feel like people only see me that way, but [even] when they do, I feel appreciative of it because she was very impactful on so many people's lives.'

Hilary added: 'I definitely went through big frustrations of being like, "Why can I not get a shot at being someone else?" 

'Not that I want to dog every casting director out there, but there's a very small handful of people who are character actors and can be hired for roles that are truly different from one another. 

'From age 21 to 25, before I became a mom, there was a lot of frustration. I would get to producer callback and they'd be like, "She's so great and she gave us the best reading and blah blah blah, but she's Hilary Duff..."'

Recalling her experiences of teenage fame, Hilary shared: 'Isolation... and the pressure of being a role model.'

The star also revealed that she experienced 'normal bullying' just like everyone else and it triggered a 'really poor body image' for herself.

She said: 'Girls are mean. I experienced normal bullying like everybody else. That was a really rough time to be in the public eye, and that definitely triggered a bad relationship with food. I had really poor body image, I guess.'

While Hilary also admitted that she was at times tempted to 'go off the rails' but she always held a sense of 'I don't want to embarrass myself'.

She revealed: 'It's not like I didn't sneak off and party sometimes and get drunk. I definitely did all of those things. But I feel like I've always been a well-balanced person, and always had a sense of "I don't want to embarrass myself". 

'I have a lot of self-awareness and I've had it for a long time. I don't think you can pin that on "she had a great mother" or "she had a solid this or that."

'Isolating': Discussing how she navigated the spotlight as a teen, the actress told the magazine it was 'isolating' and she felt under pressure to be a 'role model' (pictured in 2003) 

'I mean, I did and I'm grateful, but the fame I had can outgrow any strong family you've come from. I think it is who you are inside.'

Talking about fellow Disney stars, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez, and whether she gave any advice, Hilary added: 'I think people imagine that Disney is just this big studio where everyone hangs out, but it wasn't like that. 

'When Hannah Montana and Wizards Of Waverly Place came along, I was on tour and desperate not to be Lizzie McGuire any more. I was so happy that someone was taking that spot from me. It didn't really feel right for me to be giving advice. 

'Everyone's on their own journey and the things they had to deal with were different. They came up when social media was starting to pop off.'

Hilary sweetly added about Miley, who has since launched a successful singing career: 'Miley is such a powerhouse and has been so brave and so bold throughout her career. 

Typecast! Hilary also shared her past 'frustrations' at being typecast as Lizzie McGuire and missing out on roles that were 'truly different' (pictured in 2003) 

'She's just really an inspiration and to know that I had a part in her wanting to entertain is a huge compliment.'

Last year it was announced during the Disney Plus D23 Expo that Lizzie McGuire would have a reboot and would pick up where Lizzie last left off.  

The original show aired on the Disney Channel from 2001-04 and even received its own movie, which was released in 2003 and grossed $55 million at the box office.

Yet the reboot was put on hold earlier this year due to 'creative differences' while Hilary argued against a PG rating.

Talking about the reboot and decision to halt production, Hilary explained: 'There's still no, like, "For sure, this is happening," but I think they're pretty confident that we can make the show that I want, and that they want, for Disney+. 

Talking about fellow Disney stars, Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez (L-R), and whether she gave any advice, Hilary added: 'I think people imagine that Disney is just this big studio where everyone hangs out, but it wasn't like that.' 

'I really want to do right by 30-year-olds who grew up with Lizzie and still have that 12-year-old voice inside of them, cheering them on but also making them feel like an idiot at times. 

'But, you know, 30-year-olds have sexual experiences and drink alcohol so I think they're just trying to wrap their heads around what that looks like, on that platform. 

'I don't want to do it unless I can speak to the people I care about, and [Lizzie] can be there for those people again.'

Elsewhere in her life, Hilary welcomed her first child aged 24 - a son called Luca, now eight, with her ex-husband Mike Comrie. 

The star also has daughter, Banks, nearly two, with second husband Matthew Koma.  

Reflecting on being a young mother, Hilary admitted that the experience was 'isolating' but she was 'so ready' to become a mother.

She said: 'I felt like I was so ready to be a mom. Everyone was like, "Oh. My. God. You're a baby having a baby."

'But I felt like I had done so much and I was so ready for something more and something that was personally mine. But I will say that was one of the loneliest times in my life.'

She recalled: 'I remember when Luca was a newborn, my friend came round and was talking about hooking up with a guy at a club and I had a baby on my boob and I'm searching for a breast pad so I don't leak.

'She looks at me and she's like, "I don't even know what to talk to you about because anything I'm going to say is not as important as what you're doing. Like, who are you?!"

'I don't think she meant it how it sounded but when she left I was like, "I've lost my friend! She doesn't relate to me any more and I don't relate to her."'

Hilary also discussed the coronavirus crisis and lockdown, revealing there were times she wanted to meet her friends for a glass of wine.

She added: 'I'm desperate to start working. I'm really missing that part of my life [that] I've had since I was 12 years old.'
