It's no secret brands depend on prime time television shows to promote their products during ad breaks.

But viewers were quick notice the not-so-subtle use of product placement within Wednesday night's installment of The Bachelor.

At the beginning of the episode, a handful of the remaining ladies vying to win Locky Gilbert's heart were spotted by a table with a plate full of Magnum ice-creams.  

'Obvious much?' On Wednesday night, viewers slammed The Bachelor for cringeworthy product placement after cameras zoomed in on the ladies eating ice-cream 

At one point one of Locky's suitors is heard saying, 'Alright. I'm having an ice cream,' before walking over to the bowl to help herself.

It was enough to drive the Twitterverse nuts, with fans slamming the show for the shameless in-your-face ad.   

'Gotta make sure the camera takes a LONG, LINGERING shot... of that obvious Magnum ice cream product placement,' one fan tweeted. 

'Also, it's a very sizable cheese platter. And is that a magnum of champers?' a second wrote. 









Fancy an ice-cream? It was enough to drive the Twitterverse nuts, with fans slamming the show for the shameless in-your-face ad

Meanwhile a third said: 'Must eat Magnum, must eat Magnum,' before sarcastically writing, '[I have] No idea why,' alongside a photo of Bart Simpson hypnotised.

And it seems the advertisement may have worked, with another fan commenting: 'Why do I feel like an ice cream all of a sudden?'

In the following commercial break, a voice over was heard thanking the show's sponsor, wait for it, Magnum. 

Fancy that! 'Gotta make sure the camera takes a LONG, LINGERING shot... of that obvious Magnum ice cream product placement,' one fan tweeted.

It's not the first time the show has come under fire for product placement.

Earlier in the season The Bachelor featured shameless plugs for ready-made meal company, YouFoodz, and Bonds undies.   

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten

Revealing: Guess we now know what jocks Locky wears! 

Hungry: One of the girls was seen putting a YouFoodz container in the microwave
