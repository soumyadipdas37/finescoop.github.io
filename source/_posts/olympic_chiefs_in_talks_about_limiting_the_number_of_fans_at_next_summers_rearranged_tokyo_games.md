Olympic chiefs have confirmed they are in talks about limiting the number of fans at next summer's rearranged Tokyo Games.

At a Tokyo 2020 executive board meeting on Tuesday, organising committee chief executive Toshiro Muto admitted they are close approving '50 to 60' items to simplify the event and cut costs.

And Muto also said that the issue of spectators is currently being discussed, although no decision is expected until the New Year.

Restrictions on fans was discussed at a Tokyo 2020 executive board meeting on Tuesday

'When it comes to the specific numbers and how much of the percentage of total capacity should be allowed, I can't say whether that will be decided by December,' said Muto.

'We need to keep a close eye on the situation with the Covid-19 spread. We shouldn't make a decision right before Games time, but definitely we should observe the situation thoroughly.'

Capacity at professional sports events in Japan is currently limited to a maximum of 5,000.
