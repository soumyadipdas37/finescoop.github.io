Rebel Wilson officially went public with her new boyfriend Jacob Busch this week.

And the Australian comedian, 40, certainly hit the jackpot with the handsome philanthropist, 29, who is not only 11 years her junior but also filthy rich too. 

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser.

Great catch! Rebel Wilson, 40, hit the jackpot with her handsome new boyfriend Jacob Busch, 29, who is not only 11 years her junior but also filthy rich too

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of US$13.4billion.  

While it's unclear how much of that will be inherited by Jabob, his current personal net worth has been estimated at US$100million. 

At one point, the family even owned their own elephant named Budweiser. 

In 2017, the young entrepreneur launched his own beer called Sons Beer with best friends Carlo Mondavi and Elliott Taylor.

Despite branching out on his own, Jacob is still very much involved with his family's charity, the Busch Family Foundation, which benefits the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and The Boys and Girls Club.

Jacob and Rebel's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for the 29-year-old, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59.

The former couple started dating when Jacob was just 24, and their on-again/off-again relationship lasted for several years until they eventually split for good.

Despite the break up, the pair have remained friends, and were even pictured together last October.

Rebel and Jacob made their red carpet debut at Prince Albert's Planetary Health Gala on Wednesday.

While the Isn't It Romantic star and the beer heir held back on any public displays of affection, they are reportedly 'officially boyfriend and girlfriend.'

'He's a gentleman, has very old school manners and treats her well,' a source told People of their relationship dynamics.

'He is also very health conscious and they've been motivating each other with their health journeys,' they added.

Rebel has drastically slimmed down this year after embarking on a health and fitness journey in January.
