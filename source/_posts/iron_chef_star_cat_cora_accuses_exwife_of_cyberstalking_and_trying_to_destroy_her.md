Iron Chef personality Cat Cora say her ex-wife Jennifer Cora is trying to make her life a living hell.

The Mississippi native, 53, described her issues with her ex-wife as 'a nightmare that I can’t wake up from' in a chat with Page Six.

Cat Cora and Jennifer were together for 17 years and are parents to four sons, Zoran, 16, Caje, 13, Thatcher, 11, and Nash, 11.

The divorce to their two-year marriage was finalized in 2016, and Cat exchanged vows with music industry exec Nicole Ehrlich, 45, two years later.

Cat claimed Jennifer's actions beginning in 2015 have been aimed at destroying her 'life at any cost' with a pattern of 'cyber-stalking, mental and emotional distress and abuse.'

Cat, who's also been seen on My Kitchen Rules, requested a domestic violence restraining order against Jennifer this month, as did Ehrlich, who told the outlet that Jennifer's 'power and happiness comes from making Cat miserable.'

In legal docs, Cat and Ehrlich (who also is a mom-of-two) said that Jennifer has been confrontational with them in public on multiple occasions, including at the school and sports facilities where their sons go.

Cat said that in one 'pretty shocking' occurrence, 'Jennifer got up in Nicole’s face' and 'her parents witnessed it' and 'ALL 6 kids saw or heard her cornering Nicole.'

Cat told the outlet that Jennifer has been 'an uncooperative co-parent,' using the legal system as a cudgel against her.

'For instance she’s taken me to court fifteen times in four years and has basically bankrupted me by having to defend myself,' she said.

Cat said that last month, a 'strange man' trespassed on their home purportedly to serve court papers and began intimidatingly shouting at a window while the family was home.

'I didn’t know if we were being robbed, going to be killed, if he was trying to get into our house, I had no idea who this stranger was,' Cat said, adding that he 'criminally trespassed and didn’t leave when we told [him] to stand off our property until the police' showed up.

Cat said that at that time 'the police told us that we absolutely should file a restraining order against Jennifer Cora.'

Cat's petition will be heard in court September 22, with Ehrlich's slated for September 22, according to the outlet.
