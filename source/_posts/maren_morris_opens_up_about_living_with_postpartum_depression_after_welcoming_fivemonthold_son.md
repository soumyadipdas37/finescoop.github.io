Maren Morris says she's through the worst of her battle with postpartum depression, five months after giving birth to her son Hayes Andrew.

'I'm kind of coming through the tunnel now, I feel back to normal,' the Middle singer, 30, told CBS This Morning on Monday on a remote stream from her Nashville home.

The Grammy-winning artist, who welcomed son Hayes Andrew March 23 with husband Ryan Hurd, said that she was flanked by a strong support system and received mental health services amid the difficult time, which coincided with the early days of the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.

'Fortunately, I was able to do phone therapy during the pandemic,' the country music artist said, adding that she was surrounded by 'people that love [her] around [her] that are like, "Hey, if you're drowning right now, there's help."'

The My Church artist explained the turmoil she experienced at the time, saying, 'You're trying to become a new mother and good parent and do everything right and you just feel like you suck at every level.

'And then the one thing I've always felt like I have a handle on is my music. And to not be able to tour and have to furlough my band and crew, it was just a lot.'

Morris underwent 30 hours of labor and doctors had to perform a cesarean section in welcoming the child.

She told Is This Normal from Little Spoon in support of the Black Women’s Health Imperative nonprofit that she had hopes to have a natural childbirth but complications led doctors to deliver the baby via C-section.

'I stopped having contractions and it was just time to call it and get him out safely, so I just wish I had done a better job at preparing myself for the shock of a c-section, because the postpartum of a c-section is so brutal.'

She continued: 'I wish people talked more about their c-section stories because I felt, like a lot of mothers, really isolated, really lonely, right after because it was this unexpected major surgery I ended up getting.'
