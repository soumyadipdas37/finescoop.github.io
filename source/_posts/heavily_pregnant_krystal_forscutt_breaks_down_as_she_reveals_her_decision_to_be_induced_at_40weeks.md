She was hoping to give birth to her third child naturally. 

But heavily pregnant former Big Brother star Krystal Forscutt has made the decision to be induced after hitting the 40-week mark in her pregnancy, if it doesn't happen imminently. 

The 34-year-old shared the update with fans in a teary Instagram video and said that the decision was driven by some complications from the birth of her second child in 2018. 

'Well and truly cooked': Heavily pregnant former Big Brother star Krystal Forscutt has made the decision to be induced after hitting the 40-week mark in her pregnancy

She decided to 'make a call' on Wednesday after learning her doctor was going to be away for the weekend.

'I just wanted him there, obviously with what happened last time with my hemorrhage,' she told her followers on Instagram.

'I would feel more secure if he was there on the day that I'm going to be giving birth. I've had to make a call and not feeling great about it.'

Krystal's decision also follows a number of failed attempts to induce labour naturally. 

'Counting on my body going into labour naturally this time, but hasn't worked out that way so it was either that or risk my doctor not being here for it ... or waiting until next week and potentially being so far over it may be harmful for the baby,' she explained.

'That's the decision I've made and now I'm second guessing it and wanting to change it already.

'Hopefully he just comes on his own before then and I won't have to worry about it.' 

Her confession comes after she flaunted her 40-week 'well and truly cooked' baby bump in a candid photo at the beach.

'Not so patiently waiting for you,' Krystal's caption on her Instagram post read.

Krystal revealed she was expecting her 'miracle' with husband Neil Hipwell in early March.

The couple are already parents to Nakoda, one, and Sunny, five.

The duo were told to be 'cautiously optimistic' about Krystal's third pregnancy after she lost a significant amount of blood a few weeks later and almost suffered a miscarriage.

Krystal, who was 13 weeks pregnant at the time, has suffered two previous miscarriages. 

'We had the fright of our lives, in a public bathroom I had a really bad bleed and we were convinced that there was no way our little baby would make it after losing so much blood,' she said back in March. 

'I went to emergency and was told that I was most likely suffering an impending miscarriage.

'That evening my heart felt like it was being crushed. I was mourning for another child that I had never met. I just couldn't believe this was happening again.' 

The pair were 'shocked' the baby survived - which is why they are praying for the little bundle of joy's safe arrival.

'Lots of prays he comes naturally,' Krystal said on Wednesday.
