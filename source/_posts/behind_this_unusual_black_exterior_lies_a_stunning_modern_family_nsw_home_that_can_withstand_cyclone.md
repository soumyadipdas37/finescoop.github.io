Behind the black panel walls of an unusual beach house on the New South Wales Central Coast lies a breathtaking modern family home that boasts uninterrupted views of the Pacific Ocean.

Built 10 years ago on Forresters Beach, between Terrigal and Bateau Bay, the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home is fitted with a games room, home gym, multiple living rooms, a frameless shower and a courtyard.

The architect Matt Thitchener built the property to withstand cyclones if necessary, due to the fact that his parents - who previously owned the house - are structural engineers. 

It is split across three levels and houses decks on each level, alongside a beautiful spacious rooftop and spa.

The open-plan house has a sleek Caesarstone kitchen (pictured) that has been fitted with countless modern appliances; there is also a wine cellar within the home

While the exterior of the property is striking, the interior is just as special.

Alongside the four bedrooms and three bathrooms, the open-plan house has a sleek Caesarstone kitchen, integrated sound system, underfloor heating and a spacious wine cellar.

The bathroom is a standout room, thanks to its huge bathtub, rainforest shower area and home spa feel. 

The home gym is also impressive, filled with weights machines, floor-length mirrors and a TV screen so you can relax while you work out.

The house has two double garages joined by an undercover passage dubbed 'The Bunker', which offers parking for another four cars.

There is a track that leads directly to Forresters Beach via the adjoining Wyrrabalond National Park.

'The house is extremely private and on a clear day, you have views all the way to Cape Three Points past Terrigal,' real estate agent Baraka Leporte told FEMAIL.

'It's a home that easily accommodates friends and family with superb flexibility and a thoroughly modern edge.'

The house has four spacious double bedrooms (one of the bedrooms pictured), all of which have their own private deck space to enjoy

Much of the home is focused on indoor and outdoor 'flow', so that the entertaining spaces (pictured) are always connected to the outdoors

The home (pictured from below) has recently sold to new owners for $3.5 million, making it the second most expensive house ever to sell in Forresters Beach according to agent Baraka

The buyers are reportedly a Sydney family who had never heard of Forresters Beach (pictured) before being shown the property

The buyers are reportedly a Sydney family who had never heard of Forresters Beach before being shown the property.

They intend to use the space as a 'weekender' or holiday home when they want to get away from the city.
