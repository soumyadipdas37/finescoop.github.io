Jeremy Clarkson cut a casual figure as he arrived in the Scottish Highlands to film scenes for The Grand Tour on Wednesday.

The TV presenter, 60, was joined by James May and several crew members as they filmed a segment of the show in an open field.

Jeremy was seen behind the wheel at one point as he filmed in a bright blue car towing a caravan.

The broadcaster opted for a laid back look for the shoot, sporting a khaki green jacket and a pair of blue jeans as he chatted to his co-host James. 

Jeremy and James adhered to Covid-19 guidelines as they sported face masks while waiting between takes and maintained social distance. 

The Grand Tour was created by Jeremy, James, Richard Hammond and Andy Wilman, conceived after the three hosts left Top Gear. 

In December, the former Top Gear stars appeared in the first of a series of specials called The Grand Tour Presents: Seamen.

The feature-length episode saw the captivating trio head off on an adventure across the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia, where they captain three very different types of vessels.

In the special, Jeremy, James and Richard headed out on a 800km journey through Vietnam and Cambodia that begins Tonlé Sap Lake.

During their trip, the trio had to weave their way through a series of challenges and unexpected mishaps as they make their way to the Mekong Delta.

To go on this epic adventure, Jeremy headed out on a Vietnam-era PBR (Patrol Boat River), which most famously appeared in Apocalypse Now.

And Richard channelled his inner Don Johnson by setting off on a Miami Vice style speedboat, while James headed out on a classic 1939 wooden river cruiser.
