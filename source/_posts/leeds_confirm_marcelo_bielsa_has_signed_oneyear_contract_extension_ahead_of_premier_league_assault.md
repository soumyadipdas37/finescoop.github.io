Leeds United have confirmed that boss Marcelo Bielsa has signed a one-year contract extension at the club on his £6million package. 

The Argentine was out of contract this summer but has now committed his future to the club ahead of the newly-promoted side's first season back in the Premier League for 16 years.

The 65-year-old - whose side start their campaign at champions Liverpool on Saturday - has taken charge of a total of 100 games for Leeds since joining in 2018, winning 56, drawing 17 and losing 27 games.

The 65-year-old will lead the club in the Premier League after winning the Championship

Last season he guided Leeds to the Championship title as they finished 10 points clear of West Brom and created history in the club's centenary campaign.

The official confirmation comes after Bielsa revealed during his pre-match press conference ahead of their opener against Jurgen Klopp's men that he will remain for a third season at Elland Road.

'I will be working the next season at Leeds United,' he said. 'Everything has been sorted and I'll definitely be here next season.'

Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Bielsa's salary also covers the wages of his backroom team and the complexity of such an arrangement has added to the delay.

Moreover, the 65-year-old's attention to detail in the terms of his contract has been the primary reason why it has taken seven weeks to finalise since the end of last season.

Asked about the delay, he said: '(To make sure) that the club had the necessary structures to compete at an adequate level. This is in reference to logistics, the academy, health and maintenance of the institution.

'I had to make sure all areas of the club were running how they should.'
