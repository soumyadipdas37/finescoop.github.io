The plunge back into lockdown has left the Chancellor with a near-impossible task.

Previous rescue packages were based on the hope that by now, we would be emerging from the Covid crisis and going back to normal.

Instead, Rishi Sunak finds himself trying to pull off a fiendishly difficult balancing act.

His aim is to wean businesses off the hugely expensive furlough scheme, which has kept many afloat artificially and has been supporting 'zombie' jobs.

He has to stem the tide of taxpayers' money flowing out of the coffers and fend off the worst peacetime budget crisis in modern history.

At the same time, he wants to protect jobs that are viable, given some short-term aid.

So what are the measures, will they work and the all-important question: how on earth will we pay the bill?

National debt stands at £2trillion and counting so it is testament to Mr Sunak's competence and sangfroid that he injected a note of optimism that we can thrive if we just learn to live with the virus.

The centrepiece of the winter economic plan is the Job Support Scheme. Billed as the successor to furlough, it aims to prop up firms facing a drop in demand due to the virus.

It also ends the undesirable element of furlough whereby millions of employees were paid by the taxpayer to do nothing.

The new scheme is much less generous. For a start, no-one will be paid to remain totally idle: it is only available for staff putting in at least a third of their normal hours.

Employers will pay full wages as normal when staff are at their posts. They will also pay a third of the bill when people are not working, with the Government paying another third.

Unfortunately, it leaves employers far worse off than under furlough and in the invidious position of having to pay staff wages for time off when they aren't producing anything.

The scheme is meant to be temporary and it certainly could not be sustained long-term.

Shelling out wages in return for zero productivity would torpedo any bottom line.

Employees, too, are out of pocket unless their company pays the remaining third of their normal salary.

Yes, it is better than having no job at all, but it also means reduced spending power and confidence, which will hold back the economic recovery.

And it may not be possible to tell the difference between a 'viable' and an 'unviable' job. It seems inevitable that, as with furlough, many firms will sign up for the support and end up having to sack people anyway. 

In already highly stressed sectors, such as retail and hospitality, there have to be severe doubts over whether firms will feel they can afford to participate.

Many businesses have already started redundancy consultations and it is doubtful whether this will be enough to make them relent.

The Chancellor did not provide costings for the Job Support Scheme but it is plain it is vastly less generous than furlough.

The subsidy equates to around 22 per cent of an employee's salary if they are only working a third of normal hours, compared to 80 per cent under the furlough scheme when it was first deployed.

That is a big extra cost to employers. Put it another way, independent economists estimate the bill for the new measure could add up to around £3billion, which sounds a lot but is a mere fraction of the £35billion so far for furlough.

The self-employed will also see their help taper off in the coming months.

Measures include an extension of the temporary VAT cut for hospitality and tourism to the end of March next year, which is welcome and will help cashflow.

Businesses that have taken on subsidised emergency borrowings are being given longer to pay them back.

The length of these loans has been extended from six years to ten, which will dramatically cut monthly repayments.

The sting in the tail is that firms will be burdened with debt for longer, which means they have less scope to invest in future and will act as a drag on the economy in years to come.

None of this is to say the Chancellor has done the wrong thing. He was right to launch a huge lifeboat for the economy in the spring and he is right to extend a further helping hand now.

Painful as it may be, businesses and individuals do need to be weaned off the ultra-generous schemes that have been provided thus far.

Some will inevitably go to the wall, which is awful for those concerned. But the Chancellor is not in the business of illusory magic money trees: he wants to help firms with strong roots and real prospects to grow.

He cannot countenance writing blank cheques until a vaccine arrives, if it ever does.

The public finances are already shot to smithereens.

Government borrowing is already forecast to hit £300billion this year and following the announcements yesterday, some economists are predicting it could rise as high as £370billion.

One small consolation is that we are fortunate we went into this with strong public finances.

And the surge in borrowing, though the bald numbers look alarming, is actually not an imminent problem. Interest rates are low, our national credit rating is good and the Bank of England can carry on printing money.

Ominously, however, Mr Sunak intimated he will be making 'difficult decisions' in the future, in other words, tax rises and spending cuts.

But we cannot tax a battered economy back to health. Nor will taking an axe to Government spending, desirable though it may be for other reasons, create a burst of prosperity.

We need to grow our way out of trouble. That means learning to live with the virus, opening up the economy and conquering our fear.
