Jon Gosselin has produced definitive proof that the child abuse investigation into him allegedly kicking and punching his son has been dropped and the allegations were 'unfounded'.

In an official letter from the County of Berks, Pennsylvania Child & Youth Services, obtained by DailyMail.com, the caseworker handling Collin Gosselin's case wrote to Jon giving him the all clear.

The letter stated: 'Dear Mr. Gosselin, This letter is to inform you that the report of suspected child abuse on Collin T. Gosselin, received by this agency on September 02, 2020, is unfounded.'

The letter, Jon says, is a formality as he had been told by his attorney that no further action would be taken within 24 hours of the incident, during which his troubled son Collin told police his dad kicked and punched him.

Jon Gosselin's 16-year-old son Collin alleged that his father punched and kicked him in a now-deleted Instagram post. Now Jon has produced definitive proof to DailyMail.com that the child abuse investigation has been dropped and the allegations were 'unfounded'

A letter from the caseworker handling the case reads: 'This letter is to inform you that the report of suspected child abuse on Collin T. Gosselin, received by this agency on September 02, 2020, is unfounded'

Jon previously told DailyMail.com exclusively: 'It's not true, I would never hit Collin, ever. I love him with all my heart' 

The letter flies in the face of what Jon's ex wife Kate has been spouting in interviews this past week, however.

Reality star Kate insisted that the CYS investigation into Jon was ongoing and took the opportunity to lay into her ex.

'Jon is a violent and abusive person,' Kate, 45, told People on Wednesday.

Kate claimed she was notified by the County of Berks, Pennsylvania CYS that Jon was under active investigation over the incident.

'If this doesn't qualify as assault, I don't know what does,' the Kate Plus 8 star said of the alleged encounter.

She said as far as she's concerned the investigation is 'ongoing' and claimed her contact at the CYS hasn't told her otherwise.

On September 3, the day after the incident, Collin, 16, posted on Instagram that his father was a 'liar' who 'beat' him.

'He punched me in the face and gave me a swollen nose and I started bleeding,' wrote the teenager. 'He then continued to kick me in the ribs after I was on the floor.'

But the post was deleted minutes after it went up.

Berks County District Attorney John Adams also confirmed last week that no charges or citations were issued as a result of the incident.

Collin wrote to his 21,000 Instagram followers: 'Yesterday he beat me up and thought nothing of it, he punched me in the face and gave me a swollen nose and I started bleeding. He then continued to kick me in the ribs after I was on the floor. He is a liar'

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com Hannah Gosselin defended her father and said Jon has always been a 'very loving and supportive dad. ' Hannah, 16, witnessed the incident during which Collin, also 16, told police his dad punched and kicked him

Jon's daughter Hannah, 16, who witnessed the whole incident, also jumped to her father's defense.

In an exclusive statement given to DailyMail.com she said: 'My dad has been there for me and Collin no matter what.

'He's been a very loving and supportive dad throughout everything.

'Collin is facing many difficult issues and my dad is doing everything in his power to help him.

'My dad loves us and has never been abusive to us in any way.'

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com last week Jon himself shot down Kate's claims that he's still being investigated, he said: 'It's not true, I would never hit Collin, ever. I love him with all my heart.'

Jon claims his son is dealing with behavioral issues and is troubled.

Upset Jon said: 'I really didn't want to have to come out and talk about this for Collin's sake, but when Kate is in the media attacking me, calling me a child abuser, I have to defend myself. I love my son and I would never hurt him.'

Jon, who has accused his ex wife Kate of abuse in the past, explained that Collin was acting out because he wasn't getting his own way

On Thursday Jon's ex-wife Kate waded in telling People magazine she had been notified by the County of Berks, Pennsylvania Child & Youth Services that Jon was under investigation over the incident.

Jon, who has accused his ex wife Kate of abuse in the past, explained that Collin was acting out because he wasn't getting his own way.

'Dealing with a child with mental health issues is taxing, I'm taxed,' the IT consultant admitted.

'But I love my son. I will not give up. I go to therapy, we all go to family therapy, to deal with having a son that has been traumatized and abused by his mother.

'It's very difficult for me. I'm trying to learn how to handle Collin, I have my own demons as well, but I never punched him or kicked him or anything like that.'

Jon added: 'None of this is Collin's fault. He's 16. He's got a lot of issues to work through and we're here to help him.'

Jon found fame alongside Kate on the Jon & Kate Plus 8 reality show featuring their life with eight children; set of twins Mady and Cara, both 19, and sextuplets Collin, Hannah, Leah, Alex, Aaden and Joel, all 16.

Collin and Hannah live with Jon, while the other children stay with Kate.
