Jorgie Porter is returning to Hollyoaks for part of a plot surrounding her on-screen family, the McQueens, as the soap turns 25.

The actress, 32, will reprise her role as Theresa McQueen on the Channel 4 soap later this autumn, four years after the character left the village for a new life in Spain.

She said: 'I was excited, but obviously a bit nervous. What if Theresa has gone out of my body and my mind?

'And the anticipation of coming back has taken so long because of lockdown, but coming back felt just like home and as if I haven't even been away for five minutes.' 

Despite her nerves, Jorgie admitted she has been able to get back into her character 'as if she's never left'.

She added: 'Everyone's still the same and they're all amazing and inviting. I've been on set a few times now and I've had the best time and Theresa has literally jumped right back into my body and my mind as if she's never left.' 

Theresa left the village in March 2016 for a new life in Spain with her daughters, Kathleen-Angel and Myra-Pocahontas.

Jorgie previously admitted she would love to see Theresa return to Hollyoaks as a 'grandma with 20 kids'.

Speaking in 2018, she told BANG Showbiz: 'I obviously love Hollyoaks, I'd never say never about returning in the future but I enjoy doing certain other things at the minute.

'I just like to experience other things. Because once you're in a soap, you're there. You're in a bubble.

'So as much as I love it, I like to space out a little bit. I'd love to go back one day, maybe as a grandma with 20 kids.'

She said: 'I was excited, but obviously a bit nervous. What if Theresa has gone out of my body and my mind?'

Back for more: She first appeared on Hollyoaks in 2008 and remained on the soap for the best part of a decade

Since departing, Jorgie has competed on Dancing On Ice and I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!

She looked for love on Celebs Go Dating and acted in the remake of Are You Being Served?

She first appeared on Hollyoaks in 2008 and remained on the soap for the best part of a decade.

Theresa will arrive back in the village later this Autumn in brand new episodes of Hollyoaks, weeknights on C4, 6:30pm with first look on E4, 7pm.
