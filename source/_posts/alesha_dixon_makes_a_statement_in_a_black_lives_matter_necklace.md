Alesha Dixon has shown support for Diversity with a Black Lives Matter necklace after ITV roll out newspaper adverts in solidarity as Ofcom complaints reach 24,500. 

The Britain's Got Talent Judge, 41, appeared on the semi-final in a bright yellow dress and a gold necklace with 'B' 'L' and 'M' pendants for the Saturday night show. 

It comes after ITV 'stood with Diversity' as they featured full-page adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial Black Lives Matters Britain's Got Talent dance.

Sharing a snap of the same advert, which shows him kneeling in black-and-white, he wrote: 'This is what change looks like.

'@ITV stand with @Diversity and we’ve never been prouder. This is in all the national papers today. Thank you again to everyone that has supported us.'

Another added: 'Yes ITV!! Time for change, time for solidarity'

One user praised: 'ITV backing Diversity on #BGT: Good on them. ITV running a national advertisement campaign in support of what Diversity did: I'm speechless. This is how you make a statement.'  

Others, however, raised concern, but were unable to reply directly to ITV's announcement, as the broadcaster had turned the option off.
