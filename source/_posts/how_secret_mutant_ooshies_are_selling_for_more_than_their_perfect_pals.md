Rare and and defective 'mutant' Disney+ Ooshies could be worth a small fortune on the booming resell market. 

The Woolworths collectibles featuring characters from the Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars franchises are so popular, they sold out earlier than they should of across Australia. 

The rarest of the official collectibles are the 'glitter' versions of Elsa from Frozen, Woody from Toy Story, Captain Marvel and The Mandalorian. 

One reseller is even selling a glittery Elsa Ooshie for a ridiculous $250,000 on eBay.

While this product listing is an outlier, it is common for people to sell glitter Ooshies for anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000. 

There are 83 people are 'watching' a glitter Elsa for $13,000 while another 40 are 'watching' one  for $12,500. 

Defective Ooshies with melted plastic, missing parts, incorrect colours and smudging paint are also selling for ridiculously high prices. 

A 'one of a kind' defective Elsa Ooshie that is completely white with no painting for her facial features, hair or dress, has an asking price of $2,000.
