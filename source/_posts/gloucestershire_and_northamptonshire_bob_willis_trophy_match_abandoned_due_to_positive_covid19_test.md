The Gloucester vs Northamptonshire match in the Bob Willis trophy on Sunday was suspended at lunch because a positive coronavirus case was detected in the middle of the match.   

It was discovered just before lunch that a Northamptonshire player had tested positive for COVID-19, with both teams and the ECB immediately abandoning the game to protect player welfare. 

The player involved was not part of the travelling squad to the match at the Bristol County Ground but the match was still called off straight away.

The statement read: 'In the interests of player welfare, it has been agreed between Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire and the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that the Bob Willis Trophy match, currently being played at the Bristol County Ground, has been abandoned.

'Although the player was not part of the group that travelled with the squad to Bristol (and has been self-isolating at home), further members of the Northamptonshire squad have been in contact with the player within 48 hours of the player developing COVID-19 symptoms.

'Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire and the ECB are unified in the belief that player welfare is paramount and that no risks should be taken with the health and safety of the players, officials and administrators involved in this match. 

'The match has now been abandoned and the Northamptonshire squad will return home to Northamptonshire today.'
