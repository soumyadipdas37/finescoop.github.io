Justin Bieber's fifth studio album, Changes, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in February.

Following the cancellation of his world tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pop superstar has since teamed-up with Ariana Grande for the song Stuck With U in May, and with Chance The Rapper for his new single, Holy.

And now it appears the Yummy star isn't finished with his flurry of new music as he was seen heading into a recording studio in Los Angeles on Saturday.

Bieber, 26, looked calm and cool while casually walking towards the studio dressed in yellow shorts, a grey hoodie and a pair of white Yeezy Foam Runner sneakers.

Adding a subtle touch of style, he also donned a military-green beanie cap over his brown tresses

The hitmaker has been in full promo mode with the release of the Holy song and video on Friday, which included a stop in West Hollywood for a meet-and-greet and to watch a large group of fans dance to Holy outside of a firehouse.      



New music: Bieber's new single, Holy, featuring Chance The Rapper, dropped on Friday

Holy appears to be an optimistic love song that's drenched in Christian imagery in a post COVID-19 world.

'That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me -- Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,' he sings in the catchy chorus.

'On God -- Runnin' to the altar like a track star -- Can't wait another second  -- 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me -- Feels so holy.'
