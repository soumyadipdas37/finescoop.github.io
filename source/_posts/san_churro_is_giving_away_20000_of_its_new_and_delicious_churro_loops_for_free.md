Whether you're looping in with exciting news or simply sharing heartfelt support, the sweet gesture from San Churro will certainly bring a smile to everyone who sends and receives one.

'Over the past few months, all of us have felt the distance brought on by isolation,' San Churro CEO Giro Maurici said.

'This week is all about reigniting those connections and keeping loved ones in the loop. And, the only thing better than a made-fresh-to-order traditional Spanish churro is knowing that it was gifted by someone who is thinking of you.'

To help pay the tasty deed forward, San Churro is also offering nominated loved ones a 'buy-one-get-one-free' Churro Loop to send back.

The chocolateria has a new menu that's set to launch on September 29, which features the fun Churro Loops and will be available in-store and via delivery. 

The stores are located in New South Wales, ACT, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.
