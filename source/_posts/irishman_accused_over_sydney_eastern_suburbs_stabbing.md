An Irishman accused of stabbing a man at a unit claims he was trying to 'help' the alleged victim when he dragged him out of a lift and down a hallway, leaving a trail of blood.

Patrick Earle, 23, and his girlfriend Katie Aileen Murtagh, 26, have both been charged over the alleged brutal attack of Oliver Solan, 30, in an apartment on Young Street at Randwick, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, on August 29.

Mr Solan was left with a severed ear and a punctured spleen which later had to be removed. 

Mr Earle, Ms Murtagh and Mr Solan had been drinking together at the couple's home on the night of the alleged stabbing.

Patrick Earle, 23, and his girlfriend Katie Aileen Murtagh, 26, have both been charged over the alleged brutal attack of a man in a unit in Randwick, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, on August 29

Neighbours found victim Oliver Solan, 30, barely conscious in a hallway at a Young Street apartment block in Randwick, in Sydney's east, about 8.40pm on Sunday

An argument between the two men ensued, with Mr Solan allegedly the first to attack Mr Earle causing injuries to his arm.

Mr Earle suffered a dislocated arm and cuts to his head before allegedly contacting his friend John Dunlea to ask for help.

At about 8.30pm, Mr Dunlea, along with two other Irishmen, Patrick Farrell and Christopher Morrison, arrived at the apartment complex where Ms Murtagh let them in. 

 Mr Solan was then allegedly stabbed several times. 

Graphic CCTV footage was played in court on Tuesday, showing three men running down some stairs before fleeing the apartment complex.   

Mr Solan was then seen slouched on the floor of the lift, covered in blood and barely moving, while Mr Earle left the elevator, The Daily Telegraph reported. 

Mr Earle then grabbed the back of the victim's hoodie and dragged him out of the lift and down the hallway, leaving a trail of blood. 

The Irishman's lawyer sensationally claimed his client was trying to help Mr Solan by dragging him towards the building's entrance so paramedics could treat him.  

'Before (fleeing) he placed himself at a high risk of being apprehended and importantly dragged (the victim) downstairs into the foyer so that emergency services could treat him as soon as they arrived,' he told the bail hearing. 

'When he saw he was bleeding out he went out of his way to get him into the public view.'

The prosecutor said it appeared as though Mr Earle was 'trying to dispose of the person'.  

'The manner in which he is removed and dragged down the hallway, while (the victim) resisted, that is not an attempt to assist or render aide to the victim,' she said.  

Mr Earle's girlfriend Katie Murtagh, 26, was also charged over the August 29 incident

But the lawyer argued Mr Earle wouldn't have tried to dispose of the victim in a unit that had CCTV inside.

Magistrate Jacqueline Trad said after watching the footage she couldn't be sure of Mr Earle's intentions while dragging Mr Solan.   

Mr Earle is currently facing one charge of wound person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Police are still searching for Irish national Patrick Farrell, who was also allegedly involved in the attack.
