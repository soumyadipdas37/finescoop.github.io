Reese Witherspoon is not letting a terrible 2020 get in her way.

Instead of moping around about COVID-19 and the California wildfires, the Oscar-winning actress was seen dancing with a chilled pink cocktail in her hand at home.

The 44-year-old The Morning Show producer was debuting a new yellow dress for the fall collection of her brand Draper James when she kicked up her heels with delight.

Reese was seen outside a cozy home grooving to her music as she held a chilled pink drink in a wine glass.

The Big Little Lies producer and star seemed to not have a care in the world as she looked slender in the yellow floral print number.

Her blonde hair was perfectly style as she had on pretty makeup and gold hoop earrings. The Wild star completed the look with strappy heels.

And then she was seen in the exact same dress while holding a smoothie on her Draper James Instagram page.

'Our fall line is here — my favorite collection yet! Can’t wait to see how y’all style it ✨ Xx Reese.'

Last week the star was celebrating her daughter Ava Phillippe's milestone 21st birthday.

The actress marked the special occasion with several sweet snaps of her mini-me on Wednesday, including one of Ava as a baby.

The black-and-white photo captured baby Ava wearing a party hat while sitting before a plate of cake.

Reese also shared a snap of herself with her daughter, whose looks are frequently compared to hers. 

Ava looked just like a young Reese as she struck a pose with her mother.  

In the glowing caption, Reese raved about her daughter's many positive qualities.

'Wow! How is it possible that this little girl is now 21 years old?' Reese captioned the snap. 'Happy Birthday to my sweet girl who has become the most incredible young woman. 

Baby Ava! The sweet, black-and-white snap captured the tot wearing a party hat while sitting before a plate of cake

'Her kindness, her compassion, and her huge heart never cease to amaze me. Ava, there aren't enough words to describe how proud I am of everything you've already accomplished. I cannot wait to see ALL the Good you will put into this world. I love you so much @avaphillippe' 

Ava and her younger brother Deacon, 16, are the children of Reese and her ex-husband Ryan Phillippe.

The Legally Blonde actress remarried in 2011 to talent agent Jim Toth, whom she now shares seven-year-old son Tennessee with.

Ava now studies at the University of California, Berkeley, but for Reese, watching her eldest child leave the nest was far from easy. 

'It's weird when your children go away to college,' Reese previously told host Ellen DeGeneres during a segment on her talk show. 

'It's hard. I never imagined how it felt for my mom. I might have gone into [Ava's] empty room, laid down on her bed and cried when she went to college.'

While Ava hits the books, Reese's son Deacon is currently pursuing a career in music.
