Asher Keddie's husband, Vincent Fantauzzo, has revealed the couple are living apart during the coronavirus pandemic.

The 43-year-old artist said on Monday that he's stuck in lockdown in Melbourne with the children while Asher, 46, is filming Nicole Kidman's new TV show Nine Perfect Strangers in Byron Bay, NSW.

'Lucky Asher is in Byron Bay. She is making a TV show and I'm stuck here in cold lockdown. There's a lot of Zooming and FaceTime chats going on,' Vincent told Sunrise weatherman Sam Mac.

Vincent also spoke about how he's been handling home-schooling his children.

'The kids are home-schooling, so I am trying to help with the art department,' he said.

'There's a lot of cooking and a lot of cleaning. We're all cooped up in the house but [we're doing alright],' he added.

Vincent recently swapped his brush for a camera to shoot Asher's pictorial for Marie Claire magazine at the couple's home.

'Normally there is a big crew,' he said. 'Someone suggested that I do it and I was like, "Yeah, sure."

'I had no idea how hard it would be to take photos of my wife!'

In her interview with Marie Claire, Asher revealed how she first met her husband, and said she was immediately drawn to his 'chaotic' energy.

'When Vincent finally arrived, he was very dishevelled and chaotic-looking. There was an instantaneous and intense connection between us,' she said.

In 2015, they welcomed their first child together, a son named Valentino Fantauzzo. Vincent has an older son, Luca, from a previous relationship.
