Boston authorities said Monday that a woman in her 30s was crushed to death at an apartment building when an elevator suddenly dropped between floors as she tried to load her package inside.

Police said they were called to 1140 Commonwealth Avenue in Allston around 5pm. 

Authorities said the woman, who had recently moved into the building, was found in the elevator on the first floor. She was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Boston authorities said Monday that a woman in her 30s was crushed to death in an elevator accident at an apartment building (pictured). Police said they were called to 1140 Commonwealth Avenue in Allston around 5pm

An unidentified witness told Boston 25 News that she 'heard just an ungodly scream and we ran into the hallway and saw a gentlemen who was in distress screaming and hyperventilating and saying she’s dead, she’s dead'.

Residents of the building weren't allowed inside for about 90 minutes as police worked the scene. They were informed that the elevator was stuck between the first floor and the basement.  

Eric Carmichael told CBS that his wife was on the first floor when the accident occurred. 

He said she told him that it all happened so fast and there was nothing she could do to help.   

'The lady was trying to put her package into the elevator, like that's how we do it. Take it from the lobby,' Carmichael told the station. 

'I guess maybe the package and the woman were over the limit of what the elevator could handle so then what my wife said she saw was the lady's arms like hanging onto her package.'

Carmichael called the accident terrifying because it could have been anyone of the residents inside when the elevator malfunctioned.  

'Terrible old elevator that should have been probably kept up better,' he added.

Another resident told CBS that the elevator is an old system. 

'It's a two-slide door system and unless that door is completely shut, it does not move ever,' Nevada Foskit said. 'If something did happen, it clearly had to be faulty.'

It's unclear when the elevator was last inspected but officials from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and police are still investigating. 

The building itself dates back to 1920, according to tax records, but it's unclear when the elevator was installed.  

Police said an autopsy will be conduced to determine how the victim died. No other details were immediately available.
