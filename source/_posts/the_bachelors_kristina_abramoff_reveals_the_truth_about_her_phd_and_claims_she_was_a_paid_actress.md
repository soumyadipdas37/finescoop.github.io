Kristina Abramoff was sent packing on The Bachelor last week after she failed to find love with Locky Gilbert.

And now, the 24-year-old has offered proof she has completed her Bachelor's degree, amid claims she was a paid actress.

Sharing a video to her YouTube account, the brunette answered several burning questions during a 12-minute Q&A session about her experience on the show.

'No, I don't have a degree. Absolutely do not have a degree. I just made this up,' she sarcastically tells the camera, as she holds up her certificate.

'Bachelor of Science. Kristina Joey Abramoff, yes, my middle name is Joey,' she revealed.

'That's my first degree, a Bachelor of Science and Physiology.'

'No, I don't have a degree. Absolutely do not have a degree. I just made this up,' she sarcastically tells the camera as she holds up her past Bachelor certificates

Proof: 'Not is a lie, who is it? But Bachelor of Science. Kristina Joey Abramoff, yes, my middle name is Joey,' she revealed 

The former Bachelor contestant then went on to explain that her PhD, which she is currently working towards, is on clinical research and is focused on type one diabetes.

Kristina was sent home during last week's rose ceremony after she failed to put any effort into pursing Locky, leading viewers to believe she was only on the show to chase fame.

'I was just a contestant like everybody else,' she explained.

'I don't care that 20 girls have got to fighting over him - I have to see if this was a guy that I just met. Would I go there?' she said about bachelor Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert

The brunette went on to say that while she wasn't a paid actress, but she was approached by producers to appear on the Channel 10 dating program. 

'I went in there and I was like he's going to tick my boxes,' she said.

Kristina explained that she didn't feel a connection with Locky, and had no intentions of pretending to be interested just for the camera.
