3. Roll the paste with a rolling pin to the desired thickness (about 2-6mm).

4. Cut into shape and place onto a baking tray.

5. Bake on 170C for 20-30 minutes. Oatcakes should be toasted brown and not soft in the middle.

6. Enjoy!  

 

The royal posted a step-by-step guide to creating Cheesy Baked Eggs on the @ClarenceHouse Instagram page to mark the British Cheese Weekender. 

Alongside snaps and the recipe for the delicious meal, Prince Charles opened up about the importance of 'good food' during the crisis, saying: 'One thing that undoubtedly brings many of us great comfort is good food.' 

He went on to urge amateur chefs to seek out organic ingredients for the bake 'where possible' and 'support British cheesemakers' and other small businesses who might be struggling during the coronavirus crisis.   993. 

The Instagram post read: 'On the final day of the #BritishCheeseWeekender, The Prince of Wales has released a message to encourage us all to support British cheesemakers.'

The recipe, which was described as one of the royal's favourite, was shared on the @ClarenceHouse Instagram page alongside a step-by-step photo guide (right, the ingredients, and left, pouring the double cream  onto the vegetables and egg)

Prince Charles added: 'It is deeply troubling to learn that this crisis risks destroying one of the most wonderful joys in life – British cheese.' 

The royal was quoted as saying: 'British cheesemakers need our support during this time of great uncertainty, and we can all help in the simplest way. 

'By sourcing British cheese from local shops and cheesemongers, and directly from producers online, you can make a vital contribution to keeping these small businesses afloat during the prevailing crisis.'  

A snap of the ingredients laid out on a brown wooden chopping board was shared on the Clarence House Instagram stories, alongside a note to encourage royal fanws to buy organic ingredients 'where possible.'

Darren McGrady, 58, who now lives in Texas, worked for the late Lady Diana from 1993 to 1997 and would oversee the heirs to the throne's diet. He shared the recipe to their favourite chicken and pasta dish 

Meanwhile further photographs were shared with the step-by-step guide to making the bake.  

It comes after Princess Diana's former chef has revealed the recipe for one of Prince William and Prince Harry's favourite childhood dishes. 

Darren McGrady, 58, who now lives in Texas, worked for the late Lady royal from 1993 to 1997 and regularly shares delicious recipes and a sprinkling of royal secrets from his time at Kensington Palace on his Youtube channel. 

He recently shared how to make a mouth-watering mac and cheese dish with roast chicken, a meal, he claims was among Prince William and Prince Harry's favourites when they were children. 

He also explained how the boys' nanny had a trick to make sure they ate plenty of greens, even though, like most children, they were not fans of veggies. 

McGrady explained he would serve his irresistible crispy roast chicken with some home-made mac and cheese, with his own cheese sauce. 

The chef warned about using pre-made sauces that are often filled with additives, and showed how he whips up a creamy option from scratch in just two minutes.

He said the meal was both cheap and easy, and only takes 30 to 45 minutes to make. 

The prince (pictured with their mother in 1987) liked to eat their pasta with shuck corn, but their nanny made sure they would eat their greens, too 

While Prince William and Prince Harry preferred to eat their chicken and mac and cheese with shuck corn, their nanny made a point of ensuring there were added vitamins from vegetables. 

McGrady said she would insist he served his delicious dish with a side of broccoli for the boys to eat.

'The boys, I guess like any boys, weren't huge fans of broccoli, but what she said was "When you do the broccoli - I want you to have one piece of broccoli with each piece of chicken",' McGrady recalled.
