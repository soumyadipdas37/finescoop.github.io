Deputy Jacob Miller spotted the pickup truck swerving and pulled it over before a passenger got out and Rapson sped at him as he got out his car

Miller told Fox13: 'That driver, as I was attempting to get out of my car attempted to run me over, reversed, drove at my car and drove off. 

'There’s fear that runs through, you don’t have any barriers there’s a truck that’s driving at you.'
