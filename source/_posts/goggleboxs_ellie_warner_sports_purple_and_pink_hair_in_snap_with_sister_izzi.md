They're set to return to their sofas for Channel 4's Gogglebox.

And Ellie and Izzi Warner showed off their glamorous new looks ahead of the show's comeback next week, as they posed for a selfie together on Friday.

The reality star, 28, was sure to turn heads with her newly dyed purple and pink locks, while her sister, 25, looked stunning with her new brunette curls.

Changes: Gogglebox's Ellie Warner sported two-tone purple and pink hair as she showed off her new look alongside her glamorous sister Izzi in a family snap shared on Friday

Ellie's two-tone locks fell gracefully over her shoulders as she posed while throwing a peace sign to the camera.

She put on a casual display for their day of filming on their parents' signature grey sofas, as she paired a grey hoodie with black trousers.

Izzi also looked sensational with her new look, and she put on a stylish display for the snap as she wore a white off-the-shoulder top with denim jeans.

Gushing about their return to the show, Izzi wrote in the caption: Guess who’s back...back again'

Last month, Izzi stunned fans as she proudly showcased her slender figure on Instagram over the weekend six months after giving birth to her daughter Bessie.

The reality TV star took to social media to post a snap of herself looking slender in a fitted black t-shirt as she ribbed her partner Grant for his photography skills.

The Channel 4 star also wore a pair of curve-hugging acid wash jeans that featured statement rips down each of the legs.

The mother-of-two accessorised her outfit with a black Gucci belt and a complemented leather bag.

Izzi rounded off her look by working her long caramel tresses into a soft curl and sported glamorous make-up. 

Captioning the radiant shot, she penned: 'If anyone knows any crash courses in photography I can send Grant on please let me know #wheresmyfeet #bestofabadbunch #datenight'.
