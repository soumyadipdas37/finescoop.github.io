She is the latest star preparing to welcome a Love Island baby.  

And Camilla Thurlow is certainly getting excited about the arrival of her child with her co-star Jamie Jewitt as she took to Instagram on Thursday. 

The former bomb disposal expert, 31, who starred in the third series of the show, posed for a pretty snap and lamented the size of her underwear. 

Bumping along nicely! Camilla Thurlow is certainly getting excited about the arrival of her child with her co-star Jamie Jewitt as she took to Instagram on Thursday

Camilla was radiant in the picture as she smiled at the camera and showed the rising hem on her top around her growing stomach.

Revealing she's in her 35th week, she penned a caption reading: 'The tops are getting shorter, the leggings are getting higher, the ankles are getting bigger... and don't even get me started on the size of the underwear #35weeks'.

Clearly as excited as his girlfriend, Jamie wrote: 'So close!!!' 

Camilla's post comes after she admitted there have been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but that she's 'very happy' while talking to Andi Peters on Lorraine.

Ha! Revealing she's in her 35th week, she penned a caption reading: 'The tops are getting shorter, the leggings are getting higher, the ankles are getting bigger... and don't even get me started on the size of the underwear #35weeks', while Jamie also commented

New: Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World - a memoir about finding courage at work and in her personal life. Pictured with Andi Peters

The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.

She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust. 

'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. 

Something for herself: Camilla was approached to go on Love Island at a time when she said she was 'struggling' after returning  from Afghanistan 

'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.

'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'

Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World 

The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.

Exciting time: Camilla has been sharing a steady stream of baby bump pictures on social media and has said she is 'very very happy'
