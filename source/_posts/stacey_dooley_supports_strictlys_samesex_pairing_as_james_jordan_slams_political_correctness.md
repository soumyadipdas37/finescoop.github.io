Stacey Dooley has thrown her support behind Strictly Come Dancing's first same-sex pairing while James Jordan claimed Britain 'panders to political correctness' shortly after the move was announced. 

Nicola Adams will make history as part of the BBC show's first female couple, as she said in a statement: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'

Stacey, 33, who won the show in 2018, hit back at online trolls who slammed the BBC's decision after she tweeted: 'Strictly are doing a same sex couple and YES THIS IS LONG OVERDUE!'

A person replied to the BBC presenter's tweet and wrote: 'Don't agree' to which Stacey replied: 'Don't care' along with a kissing face emoji.

In another tweet, the TV star added: 'Plus, I love @NicolaAdamsOBE ... can't wait'. 

However, former Strictly professional dancer James Jordan, 42, appeared to take a different view as he took to Twitter and said Britain 'panders to political correctness'. 

He wrote: 'Random Rant. We have become a scared little embarrassing country that panders to political correctness. #F**koffPCBrigade'. 

Contestant: Boxer Nicola Adams, 37, will make history as part of the BBC show's first same-sex pairing on this year's series

Critical: James Jordan, 42, appeared to take a different view as he took to Twitter and said Britain 'panders to political correctness' (pictured in January 2020) 

While James' tweet did not reference Nicola or Strictly, many speculated that was what he was referring to.

One person replied to his tweet, saying: 'Why does it matter?? Is there an unwritten rule that dance partners have to be male and female? 

'Honestly I’ve never thought about it being an issue either way. Your ranting is actually pandering to the whole culture of being outraged by every little thing.'

Another said: 'I take it you're not in favour of a same sex couple in Strictly? Shame.'

James then sent out another Tweet and insisted he was not referring to any one thing in particular, but rather society as a whole.



Support: Stacey hit back at online trolls who slammed the BBC's decision after she tweeted: 'Strictly are doing a same sex couple and YES THIS IS LONG OVERDUE!'

He said: 'My last tweet was actually very generic but I love how many of you jumping to conclusions on what I was ranting about

'It wasn’t just one thing.... it’s everything nowadays. Must be my age.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Strictly Come Dancing for comment.  

James and his wife Ola, 37, who were both dancers on the show, previously slammed the idea of introducing same-sex pairings to the series.

The outspoken couple claimed the move - proposed by judge Craig Revel-Horwood, would take away from the 'masculine and feminine' aspect of dancing, branding it an 'insult to our profession'. 



Speaking out: James slammed 'political correctness' on Twitter, with many speculating that he was referring to Strictly Come Dancing

Speaking to the Daily Star in 2017, James said: 'No, there definitely shouldn't be same-sex couples on Strictly.

'Ballroom and Latin dance is about masculinity and femininity. It's not about sexual orientation. It's not a dating show. Why can't a gay man dance with a woman?

'It's actually insulting that you're trying to change our profession with people saying same-sex couples should definitely be on there when it doesn't need to be.' 

Speaking about joining this year's Strictly, former professional boxer Nicola, 37, said: 'I'm really excited to be joining this year's incredible line-up for Strictly Come Dancing.

'I'm a huge fan of the show and am thrilled to be part of something that holds such a special place in so many people's hearts.

'People might know me from work in the ring, but I'll be every bit as passionate and dedicated on the dance-floor too.' 

'I also wanted to thank the BBC for supporting me and making me the first ever all female-pairing; and it's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'

Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.'

Revealing she approached Strictly with the idea for a same-sex pairing, Nicola explained: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said "yeah I'll do it but I want to dance with another female dance partner.'"

'It's definitely a time for change and time to move on and be more diverse. This is a brilliant step in the right direction. It will be nice for the LGBT community to be able to see that there are same-sex couples on the show as well.'

Winner: BBC presenter Stacey won the 2018 series of Strictly with Kevin Clifton

Nicola became the first female amateur boxer to win an Olympic gold medal at London 2012 and became double Olympic champion following her second gold medal win in Rio 2016 as well as being the first boxer in history to retain an Olympic title.

Having also become World Amateur Champion in May 2016 she secured a grand slam of titles, and is the only female boxer in the history of the sport to have won every major title available to her; Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth.

In recognition of her services to boxing and unprecedented achievement, Nicola was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year’s Honours list. She was made an OBE in the 2016 New Year’s Honours list.

She recently retired from the sport with an undefeated record and held the WBO female flyweight title in 2019.

Nicola's same-sex pairing comes a year after Strictly pro dancer Johannes Radebe danced with Graziano Di Prima.

According to the BBC the dance led to the most complaints they received at the time, as 189 viewers protested to the routine.

However, the channel embraced its LGBTQ+ audience, as they said in a statement: 'Strictly Come Dancing is an inclusive show and is proud to have been able to facilitate the dance between Johannes and Graziano during the Professionals' dance.

'They are dancers first and foremost, and their sex had no bearing on their routine.'

Earlier this year singer Ian 'H' Watkins and professional skater Matt Evers made history by becoming ITV's first all-male skating duo on the 2020 series of Dancing On Ice.

Meanwhile, Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo, 36, was confirmed to be taking part on Strictly via an announcement on Greg James' Breakfast Show, also on Wednesday morning, while GMB confirmed Ranvir Singh was hitting the floor live on their show.

Caroline Quentin, Max George and Jason Bell were announced as the first three contestants on Tuesday night's The One Show.
