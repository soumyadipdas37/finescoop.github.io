Arnold Schwarzenegger was seen on social media on Tuesday with a wood carved pipe likeness of his character in The Terminator that a fan made of him.

The Hollywood action hero, 73, found out about the one-of-a-kind collectible on Reddit, where the artist under the handle RadonLab posted a shot of it.

The Terminator star replied in the comment thread, 'Wow. This is fantastic. It is beautiful. Would you sell this to me?'

The Reddit used replied to the bodybuilding icon: 'I would like to give you this pipe it would be a great honor for me. How can I contact you?'

The ex-California governor wanted to provide the artist with some form of restitution for the piece.

He wrote: 'If you insist on giving it to me I insist on sending you back a signed photo of me using it.'

He added, 'Now that it’s 2020 I just sign things on my machine and send an email if that works for you, adding, 'You can send me a message and I’ll give you the details.'

The fan-friendly star was elated over the creation, writing, 'I love it. You’re really talented and I can’t thank you enough!'
