Real Madrid will not be able to afford to sign long-term target Kylian Mbappe, according to the club's former president Ramon Calderon.

The Paris Saint-Germain striker has established himself as one of the best footballers in the world and has been on Madrid's radar for some time with boss Zinedine Zidane a huge admirer.

Mbappe still has two years left on his PSG contract and would command a huge transfer fee with the French giants desperate to keep hold of their star man.

Like many clubs in Spain, Madrid's finances have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and Calderon does not believe the LaLiga champions are in a position to meet PSG's demands especially with the club already committed to spending a minimum of £500million on their project to redevelop the Santiago Bernabeu - which could rise to one billion euros by the time it's finished.

'No doubt Mbappe is a player who everyone would like to sign. He has great potential, and he is very young,' Calderon told Stats Perform News.

'He reminds me a lot of Ronaldo, the Brazilian, because of his strength and his capacity to score goals. No doubt, he would be a great transfer.

Ramon Calderon believes it is not financially feasible for Madrid to sign Mbappe in this climate

Work has started on the Bernabeu's redevelopment and could cost up to one billion euros

'I don't know if Real Madrid are able to do it now. It would be a stratospheric transfer. He has a contract with PSG – they will not give him away for free.

'On the other hand, we are into a very expensive deal with the rebuilding of the new stadium. It is up to €1 billion. So, it is difficult.'

He added: 'But if the president thinks it can be possible, he will do it. However, I guess the economy will not be the best, especially at this time, when there will be financial issues at every club.

'The costs of transfers will totally change. They will go down, and also the salaries of the players will go down.

Mbappe enjoyed another stunning season last term, scoring 30 times in all competitions

'So, it is basically an economic point. First, the player needs to ask for a transfer request and the financial agreement will come after.

'But, again, the financial agreement for Mbappe is not easy – I don't think it can be done by anyone.'  

Real Madrid had been plotting a mega bid worth £250m to sign the 22-year-old forward before the pandemic struck and are now said to be 'optimistic' about their chances of signing him next summer for significantly less if he chooses against extending his current deal.

Mbappe enhanced his reputation with another stellar campaign last term, scoring 30 times in 37 games as PSG won the domestic quadruple in France.

Construction on the iconic 73-year-old Bernabeu stadium, meanwhile, recommenced in April and an official completion date is set for October 2022.
