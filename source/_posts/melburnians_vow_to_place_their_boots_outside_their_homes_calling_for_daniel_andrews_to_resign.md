Thousands of frustrated Melburnians have vowed to leave a pair of boots outside their homes in a mass protest demanding Premier Daniel Andrews step down.

The movement, Give Dan The Boot, is set to take place on Sunday with more than 3,000 people already vowing to take part.

The at-home protest is the brainchild of the group Victoria Forward, which is ran by 19-year-old Donald Trump supporter and Liberal member Edward Bourke.

It comes after anti-lockdown protests erupted across the country over the weekend, with 17 arrested in Melbourne and 160 fines issued.

More than 3,000 Melburnians have said they would take part at the at-home protest on Sunday

'It's time to stand up to Daniel Andrews, and now you can do it from home!' the Facebook event reads. 

'Please place a pair of boots or shoes at your front gate or around your fence this Sunday, 13th of September and post a photo to this event or use the tag #GiveDanTheBoot.

'GIVE DAN THE BOOT is a silent protest but the image of thousands of boots outside the gates of Victorian households, will decisively convey that the Victorian people have no faith in the premier.'

The group also highlighted due to the protest being carried out at home, no COVID-19 restrictions would be breached.

The page has been flooded with members criticising the premier's strict lockdown, which has been extended by another two weeks.

One man decided to put his boots out early asking what he did 'to deserve' having Mr Andrews as his premier.

Another shared a homemade sign she had made with the words #GiveDanTheBoot painted across a piece of cardboard.

One woman who doesn't even live in the coronavirus-riddled state said she too would hang out her shoes in support.

Mr Bourke's group Victoria Forward is well known for its highly critical stance on Mr Andrews.

In one social media post, the group insisted that 72 per cent of their 15,000-strong following wanted Mr Andrews to resign. 

Mr Bourke first rose to fame following a video interview with VICE Australia in 2016, where the then-15-year-old revealed his support of Donald Trump.

He also runs a government relations firm called 470 Bourke, where the teenager calls himself a 'seasoned political campaigner, activist, and strategist who has a history of success in his political predictions, comments and strategies'.

When Mr Bourke was 14 he started non-profit campaigns before taking on 'successful global political campaigns'.

The frustration comes after Mr Andrews revealed Melbourne's roadmap out of lockdown.

Currently Melburnians are in the midst of tough Stage Four restrictions which mean residents can only leave their house for four essential reasons - which as gutted local businesses and wreaked havoc on the economy.

These include for one hour of exercise a day, to give or receive care, for work or study and for necessary shopping.

There is also a 8pm-5am curfew enforced.

Announcing how restrictions would be eased on Sunday, Mr Andrews said the lockdown would be extended for another two weeks instead of ending on September 13.

The curfew will also be enforced until October 26 but will be increased to 9pm-5am. 

Cafes, bars and restaurants will not be able to have customers dine outside until October 26, as long as the statewide case average has fallen under five for the previous fortnight.

Customers won't be allowed inside until November 23 and only if there have been no cases at all for the previous two weeks.  

Victoria recorded 76 new infections and 11 deaths on Wednesday. 

Step one: The first step will come in to place on September 13.

Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. 

Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.
