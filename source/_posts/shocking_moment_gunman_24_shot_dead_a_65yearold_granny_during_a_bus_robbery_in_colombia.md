The 24-year-old subsequently turned towards the driver and had a quick exchange of words before he aimed his gun and shot Cielo Payares indiscriminately. 

The Colombian National Police arrested Fontalvo at his home Tuesday at 1:30am after learning of his location by tracking a cellphone that he had stolen from one of the passengers.

According to Caracol Radio, Payares worked as a seamstress making face masks due to the high demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Payares was on her way home after she stopped to pick up food and diapers for her great granddaughter, according to Stefany Fernández, her grand daughter. 

'I called her and she said that she was already on her way,' Fernández said. 'She raised me when my mother died. She did not deserve this. She worked to get ahead.'

A police spokesperson said Fontalvo had a prior criminal history that included eight arrests for robbery and selling drugs.
