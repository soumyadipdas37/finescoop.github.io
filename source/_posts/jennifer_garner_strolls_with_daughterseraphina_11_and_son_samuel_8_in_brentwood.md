Jennifer Garner recently declared emphatically that she 'will never be pregnant [again]' and that she is grateful to have welcomed 'three healthy kids' over the years.

And the 48-year-old actress looked every bit the doting mother as she stepped out with two of her three children, daughter Seraphina, 11, and son Samuel, eight, on Sunday.

Garner strolled through their Brentwood neighborhood in a loose grey tee that she tucked into a pair of denim jeans.

She completed the look with a pair of white Gucci sneakers that featured the brand's signature colors on the sides. 

Jennifer was juggling a slew of items in her arms, which included an iPad, a bright pink water bottle, a pair of reading glasses, and a small grey canister.

The Alias star kept the majority of her face concealed behind a pair of shades and a blue cloth mask.

She wore her brunette hair in a ponytail and she had a black Apple Watch on her wrist.

Seraphina and Samuel were clearly on the same wave length, being that they both rocked piggy tails for their walk.

The middle Affleck child rocked a pair of skinny jeans and a flannel shirt that she layered over a white graphic tee.

Samuel looked ultra casual in a pair of grey sweatpants and a blue tee with tractor printed on the front of it.

Seraphina manned one of the family dogs' leashes, while Garner's longtime personal assistant Maureen Grosser held onto Birdie's leash.

Jennifer shares all three of her children, including eldest daughter Violet, 14, who was not present on Sunday's stroll, with ex husband Ben Affleck, 48.

Garner and Affleck were together from 2005 until their tumultuous divorce in 2018. 

Ben recently moved on from Jennifer with his Deep Water co-star Ana de Armas, who he began dating in March.

The Argo star has been quarantining with the 32-year-old Cuban beauty, but the pair have not been spotted out publicly since August 20.

Meanwhile, Jennifer reportedly split from her ex John Miller in August, after nearly two-years together. 

'[John] came into her life at a low point' following her split from Ben Affleck in 2018, a source alleged to Us Weekly on September 3. 

'Jen says John brought her back to life,' according to the source, although 'it just wasn't meant to be.'

Earlier on Sunday, Garner took to Instagram to honor her parents, William and Patricia, on Nation Grandparents' Day. 

'Way to show ‘em how it’s done Grandmom and Grandad! Happy #grandparentsday, mom and dad. (Tons of love and special shoutout to Grandma Chris and Grandpa Tim!),' she wrote.

The 13 Going On 30 actress could be seen sitting between her mother and father on a porch swing with a sweet grin on her face.
