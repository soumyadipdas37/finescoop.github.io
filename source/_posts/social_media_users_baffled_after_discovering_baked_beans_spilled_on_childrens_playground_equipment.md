Social media users were left baffled after a parent discovered that baked beans had been strewn all over the playground equipment in their local park. 

The Southampton-based parent told how he was taking his young daughter to their local park on Chapel Street in Bitterne, when the pair noticed beans scattered across the swings, kid's roundabout and on the basket ball area. 

Posting to Facebook group Spotted Swanwick 2, the dad insisted he 'didn't understand' the bizarre discovery, before expressing his sadness that locals hadn't taken more care of the park.  

Puzzled users soon picked up on the post, with some calling the prank a 'work of art' and teasing they hope 'karma ketchups' to the culprit.

Sharing photos of the beans, the group's administrator penned: 'So today I take my little girl to Chapel Street Park, and this is what I found. 

'Baked beans on the swings, the kids roundabout and on the basket ball area. I don't understand. 

'When we have all been cooped up for a while now, would have thought people would want to look after parks.'  

The post quickly caught the attention of several bewildered Facebook users and garnered over 4, 800 likes, 11, 000  comments and 14, 000 shares. 

Some users were not impressed by the practical joke, with one writing: 'Nasty bugger! Rather than wasting beans by raining on other people’s parade they could have donated those beans to a food bank. Shows where the culprit’s priorities lie.' 

However, the majority of users saw the funny side of the prank, with one commenting: 'Absolutely out of order!! It’s bean a while for most people since they last ventured out to the park, let’s hope that karma ketchups to those doing it!!!'

A further joked: 'What if those beans just wanted to play on the swings? Some people are so inconsiderate!'  

Meanwhile, some users even compared the beans to a 'work of art, with one writing: 'Is that a Banksy, amazing'.
