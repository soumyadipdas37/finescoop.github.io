An Oregon woman held an alleged arsonist at gunpoint until police arrived to the scene after the man claimed he was going to start a fire on her property. 

In the footage that was shared on Kat Cast's Facebook page, Cast is seen driving up to the man as someone in her vehicle records. 

Cast gets out the vehicle holding a handgun, walks over to the man, who has not been identified, and orders him to get on the ground. 

'What are you doing on my property?' Cast asks. 'Did you light anything on fire?'

The man then responds that he was 'just passing through'.

Cast says in the video that the man didn't have cigarettes on him. She then told the man that she had called local police (pictured). According to Cast, the incident occurred over the weekend after the man threatened to start a fire on her property

She then asked him why he had matches in his hands to which he responded: 'I smoke.'

In a Facebook post, Cast revealed that people had sent her messages claiming that she faked the whole incident. 

'I read all your messages to me, even the private ones, I can tell you that this truly did happen and there is nothing fake about it.

'I do not wish to speak to anyone, it doesn't matter to me if it's a journalist who wants to put it out on the news, I will not put my family in danger by exposing myself any more than what I have already, besides the media will just twist my words.

In a Facebook post, Cast (pictured) said: 'If I need to do this again to protect my family and my neighbors, I will in a heartbeat do it again, except this time I will not be as nice as I was'

'If I need to do this again to protect my family and my neighbors, I will in a heartbeat do it again, except this time I will not be as nice as I was.'

Cast continued: 'Some of you still think we're not being attacked. I found this individual walking in my property as I was driving in, all he had were some matches in his hand.

'I walked him out of my property at gunpoint and then when we got to some asphalt ground on the main road [where I] made him lay down while the cops arrived.'

She said: 'Had my husband been here he would have been dead. This criminal has got multiple warrants, one of them [for] assaulting a police officer.'

It's unclear if local police have charged the man. 

The incident comes as California, Oregon (pictured) and Washington state suffer from historic wildfires that have burned faster and farther than ever before

The fires have caused hazardous air quality conditions in Portland, Oregon, Seattle and San Francisco

The incident comes just days after a man was arrested Portland for allegedly using a Molotov cocktail to start a brush fire. 

Domingo Lopez Jr, 45, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly starting the fire. He was released just hours before he is accused of starting six additional fires early Monday morning.  

California, Oregon and Washington state have seen historic wildfires that have burned faster and farther than ever before. 

The fires have caused hazardous air quality conditions in Portland, Oregon, Seattle and San Francisco.
