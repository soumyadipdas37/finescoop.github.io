She's set to strip off on Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals next weekend.

And on Sunday, comedian Fiona O'Loughlin went topless at the beach for a worthy cause.

Sharing a photo to Instagram, the 57-year-old used the opportunity to raise awareness for breast cancer, and to remind women to regularly check their breasts.

Baring all! Comedian Fiona O'Loughlin (pictured), 57, went TOPLESS at the beach for a worthy cause in a photo shared to Instagram on Sunday, ahead of stripping down for The All New Monty: Guys and Gals

In the image, Fiona showed off her newly died short blonde locks, and used her hands to cover her bare chest. 

She concealed her gaze behind dark sunglasses, and beamed for the shot, looking completely in her element. 

'Just wanted to show you my new hair,' she hilariously captioned the post, alongside numerous hashtags including 'check your boobs' and 'raise awareness'. 

Earlier this month, Fiona revealed what it really feels like to be baring all for breast cancer awareness.   

Baring all! Earlier this month, Fiona told The Advertiser that she didn't hesitate when she was asked to be involved on The All New Monty: Guys & Gals 

Speaking to The Advertiser, the TV star admitted she didn't hesitate when she was asked to be involved. 

'I'd stripped on stage before in one of my shows, On a Wing and a Prayer,' Fiona said.

'I thought to myself everybody (in The All New Monty: Guys & Gals) is doing it, so I didn't have much anxiety about it… and the costumes were just amazing.'

Fiona told the publication that the show's live audience was 'so pumped' for her and her co-stars, including Home and Away's Sam Frost, to take to the stage.

'It was an exciting, joyful night,' she added. 

No hesitation: 'I thought to myself everybody [on the show] is doing it, so I didn't have much anxiety about it … and the costumes were just amazing,' she told the publication 

The funnywoman was crowned Queen of the jungle back in 2018, after winning the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

Fiona will do the burlesque show alongside the likes of actress Sam Frost, entertainer Patti Newton, Russell Crowe's ex wife Danielle Spencer and Olympian Leisel Jones.   

The All New Monty: Guys & Gals continues Sunday at 7pm on Channel Seven
