The issues plagued parts of the US, with many major cities including including New York City, Washington DC and Philadelphia, along with Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The largest issues users reported were problems with logging into accounts, server connection errors and being blocked from joining conferences.

Reports began to surface after 7am ET in the US and the UK, but have since been resolved just after 1pm ET.

 August 24 marks the first day of school for much of the US, but the eight hour outage left students unable to attend online classes

Along with many Americans being unable to connect with staff on a Monday morning, August 24 also marks the first day of college for students.

However, some have flocked to Twitter to share their frustration and excitement of it being a 'digital snow day.'

Others Twitter users said the day has been canceled because they are unable to connect to the platform to conduct business, which has led others to joke that there is no need to work Monday. 

Zoom first launched in 2013, but recently gained popularity when the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the world and forcing millions into their homes.

The video conferencing app allowed people to still converse with loved ones, conduct business and learn remotely while still being lockdown.

But the outage is affecting many Americans who are working home and unable to connect with staff

Although the platform has allowed the world to communicate during the pandemic, it has come under fire for a number of privacy and security issues.

Internet trolls were Zoombombing calls by displaying pornographic and racists content while users hold work conferences, online teaching sessions and even alcohol anonymous meetings – leaving many to wonder just how secure the service is.

However, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan spoke with Good Morning America in July to assure the public that privacy is of upmost importance to the firm and revealed features that will keep internet trolls at bay.

Yuan explained that users can create passwords for meetings, waiting rooms and lockdown each session in order to keep their calls safe.

Digital break-ins on Zoom meetings are taking place across the US as much of country is placed on lockdown and forced to resort to online video conferences to communicate to limit the spread of the coronavirus - more than 245 million Americans are either self-isolating or mandated to stay home.

One Twitter user joked that everyone can stop pretending to work due to the idea that many are unable to perform their jobs without Zoom

However, all these internet trolls have to do is search the internet for links to video conferences and enter the calls to launch their sneering harassment.

‘There are things we can do every day to protect ourselves while using the platform,’ he said.

You need to understand the secure feature of about how to use Zoom.’

Those features include creating a password for each meeting, so only those attending can enter.

Users can also establish a waiting room for the group, allowing them to welcome in specific people and keep track of who is attending.

And for added safety, meetings can be lockdown once everyone is inside.

Many companies, including NASA, SpaceX, Bank of America and Google have banned staff from using the platform.
