He's had an exciting summer after announcing his engagement to Nicola Peltz in July.

And Brooklyn Beckham, 21, appeared to be in good spirits as he went shopping with a pal in New York on Monday.

The photographer's outing comes as the rest of his family gathered together in the UK to support his mum Victoria, 46, at her virtual London Fashion Week show.

Brooklyn kept things low-key in his relaxed ensemble, donning some black jeans and white trainers as he strolled along the street.

He completed his look with a black hoodie with the name 'Marlon Brando' written on the chest within a white and red box, imitating the Marlboro cigarettes design.

Making sure to stay safe, both Brooklyn and his pal ensured to wear face masks with the two men opting for simple black ones.  

Brooklyn's outing came on the same day his mother Victoria presented her latest fashion collection during London Fashion Week.

Happy: Victoria was supported by husband David and their three other children on Monday as she prepared to unveil her digital presentation for London Fashion Week 

And although they weren't able to be there to celebrate in person, Brooklyn did take to Instagram to tell Victoria he was 'proud' of her and while Nicola arranged for flowers to be sent to her future mother-in-law.

Earlier on Monday Victoria shared Instagram snaps of husband David, 45, alongside sons Romeo, 18, Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper, nine, in face masks as they prepared for the presentation.

Victoria, like most designers, has opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week as the coronavirus pandemic uproots fashion weeks around the globe. 

She captioned her snaps: 'My favourite (and only) guests this season! love you all so much @davidbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven xx we missed you @brooklynbeckham @nicolannepeltz.'  

The Beckhams ensured they all had their own masks, with Harper opting to wear a purple floral one to match her dress.

Hours earlier Victoria had shared a snap of daughter Harper donning a mini version of one of her designs ahead of the digital showcase.

The designer showed off her latest collection with the help of four models, while there was just a handful of fashion editors in attendance for a preview at Victoria Miro art gallery in East London on Sunday.

Guests at Sunday's preview all wore monogrammed face masks that were provided at the entrance of the gallery and social distancing was enforced. 

The presentation was streamed on Victoria's website on Monday afternoon, meaning one of LFW's most anticipated shows was accessible to all. 

Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons as well as eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz.
