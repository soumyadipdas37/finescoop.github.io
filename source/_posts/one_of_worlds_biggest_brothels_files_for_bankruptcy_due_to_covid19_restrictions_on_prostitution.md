One of the world's largest brothels has been forced to file for bankruptcy after it was unable to operate for months due to coronavirus.

It has been reported that the Pascha brothel, in Cologne, Germany, has used up all of its cash reserves paying for the up-keep of its 10-storey building and 60 staff.

The German daily Express has stated that this has left the brothel from which about 120 prostitutes ply their trade penniless.

It has been estimated that Pascha attracted up to 1,000 customers a day to partake of its services.

The Covid-19 pandemic has stricken the brothel as prostitution was banned in North-Rhine Westphalia, where Cologne is, five months ago to help curb the spread of the disease.

Pascha opened in January 1972 under the name of Eros Center and it was classed as Europe's first high-rise brothel.

A coalition party in Holland is calling for paid sex to be banned in a move which could leave the future of Amsterdam's famous red light district uncertain.

The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) have revived the debate to make paying for sex a punishable offence after presenting a proposal to cabinet.

The proposal, submitted by CDA MP Anne Kuik, is being debated today in Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Dutch parliament, Dutch News reported.

MPs will also discuss an initiative from Christian youth movement Exxpose to curb prostitution, which has more than 50,000 signatures.

Kuik said she hopes to tackle female inequality by banning legal prostitution. 

She claimed that 95 per cent of women who work in Amsterdam's red light district are from poorer Eastern European countries, according to the NL Times.

Kuik wants to see the Netherlands implement a legal model similar to Sweden, which criminalised paid sex back in 1999.

Under the Swedish Government's laws, the buyer is prosecuted but prostitutes are not.

Kuik argues that while it is impossible to eradicate prostitution, the Government should try to prevent it from happening.

She also claimed that the legalisation of prostitution has not stopped abuse on sex workers, which 'continues to exist'. 

The CDA's coalition partners D66 and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) are reportedly opposed to the ban, saying it will only drive prostitution underground.

It has been claimed that the chance of criminalising paid sex in the Netherlands is extremely low due to this opposition.

But the motion is expected to be supported by other government parties, including the SGP and ChristenUnie. 

The city of Cologne wanted to get rid of the red light district in the city centre and so it granted permission to build on the outskirts of the city.

In 1995 the Eros Center changed its name to Pascha where it rents, for 180 Euros a day, 126 rooms on seven floors to prostitutes.

This includes meals, medical care and the 20 Euros of tax which the authorities collect per prostitute per day.

Pascha is open 24-hours a day and customers pay a five Euro entrance fee and then they negotiate prices for services with the girls.

The brothel also houses a regular hotel, several bars and a club-style brothel on the top floor.

The business has suffered problems in the past too.

A Thai prostitute was stabbed to death by a customer in June 2003.

She managed to press the alarm button in her room and security personnel caught the culprit.

Then in January 2006 another prostitute was attacked by a customer with a knife.

The woman who was working next door heard the commotion and alerted security who grabbed the knife man before the prostitute was injured.

 Following a police raid in April 2005 by police it was reported that a gun and some cocaine was uncovered.

Police also arrested 23 people mainly due to suspected violation of immigration laws.

Reports also stated that four of the prostitutes were only aged between 14 and 15 years.

Pascha was not fined this time since the girls, who were from Africa, looked older and they carried fake documents.  

Then before the Fifa World Cup, in Germany, Muslims complained that the brothel insulted Islam.

Pascha had a large poster showing a half-naked woman and flags from all of the countries which qualified for the tournament on one side of the building.  

In response to threats of violence and protests the brothel owners blacked out the flags of Iran and Saudi Arabia on the poster.

American rapper 50 Cent gave a concert in Pascha's night club in December 2009.

Then on Mother's Day 2011 the brothel orgainsed a tour for women.

This was surprising as women are not normally allowed into the building. 

Groups representing sex workers have that the closure of brothels will likely force prostitution underground.

This, it is feared, will put the women at greater risk of violence or exploitation.
