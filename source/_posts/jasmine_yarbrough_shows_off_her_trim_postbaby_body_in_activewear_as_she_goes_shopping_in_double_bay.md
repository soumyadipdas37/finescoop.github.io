She welcomed her first child with husband Karl Stefanovic just four months ago. 

And on Wednesday, Jasmine Yarbrough showed off her trim post-baby body in activewear as she went shopping in Sydney with her lookalike sister Jade. 

The 36-year-old shoe designer was spotted having a browse around the children's store The Monogram Mode in Double Bay.

The blonde former model wore a black T-shirt with matching leggings and black sneakers. 

She went makeup free and wore her short locks up in a high bun.  

Missing from the outing was her adorable daughter, Harper May, four months.

The shoe designer gave birth to Harper at Sydney's North Shore Private Hospital.

Today show host Karl, 46, told The Sunday Telegraph earlier this month that he wants to have more children with Jasmine.

'It's perfect to come home and be with Harper and however many more kids we have,' Karl told the publication when quizzed about expanding his brood.

'You don't take it for granted, the ability to have a child, and I think we'll try to whenever the timing is right,' he added.

Karl shares three children with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn, sons Jackson, 20, and River, 12, and daughter Ava, 15.
