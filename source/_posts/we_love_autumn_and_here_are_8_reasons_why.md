As we move into September it's easy to become nostalgic for the summer.

No more sunny days. No more holidays. No more alfresco dining.

In fact, you may even be suffering from post-summer blues.

We get it. There's a melancholy vibe to the end of summer but actually, we believe that autumn is the best season of the year. 

And we're here to tell you why, in the hope you'll enter the new season with a spring in your step rather, than a backwards glance to the one that's just gone. 

Autumn really is the BEST and here's why! 

1. That back to school feeling

Many of us will never actually go back to school or college again but there's something extremely evocative about early September and it doesn't take much to get us in the mood to buy new stationery.

Come on you know what me mean... 

There was always something so cosy and reassuring about the start of a new term and that feeling has never really gone away.

So, we say embrace it and treat yourself to a new notebook or writing paper in lieu of a protractor and a set square.

This Kate Spade notebook is chic and ideal for writing down all your hopes and dreams for the rest of the year. Or just your shopping list.

2. The weather

Beautiful autumn days ahead...

The truth is, that no matter how nice the weather is in the UK during the summer it's always a let down in some way. 

It's invariably sunny and warm when you're stuck inside working, but then rains torrentially as soon as it's the weekend. 

Or, and we're all guilty of this, we complain when it's actually really hot because our country just isn't set up to deal with it.

So here comes autumn with not only low expectations weather-wise, but also a much more temperate and doable climate in general.

Still months away from the biting cold of January and February, there are bright blue skies, crisp air and usually some warmth from an autumnal sun. Only light layers required.

3. The food

Erm, hello Toad in the Hole

Autumnal food is the best.

We can still incorporate salads and leaves but there's much more scope for some slightly more comforting fare. 

Suddenly a roast dinner is much more appealing, risotto and lasagne will be making a comeback, delicious brunches are on the menu and pies, casseroles and toad in the hole are providing the joy that only comfort food can.

This Russell Hobbs casserole dish will make cooking up a feast a breeze and why not serve your family on some new dinnerware too? We love this floral design by Denby. 

4. The clothes  

The clothes of autumn and winter are just better than the clothes of summer. 

Everybody knows it and that's why the September issues of all the glossy fashion magazines are so much thicker. And don't forget, we have all those inspiring images of fashion month to pour over too.

Don't get us wrong, we love the carefree vibe of summer dressing. It's bliss. But with autumn you can really get creative with your outfits. 

Plus, it's warm enough for bare legs under your midis and maxis for a while yet.

Autumn is when you can really put a look together and strut like a style maven, before we end up just wearing whatever keeps us warm enough during the winter months.

Transitional outerwear, light layers and gorgeous knitwear. We're here for it ALL.

This midi dress by Monsoon is autumn perfection. It retains a summery hippyish aesthetic, but with long sleeves and at calf length, you won't get too chilly.

Wear it with bare legs now and with opaque black tights when the temperature drops.

A single breasted overcoat is always a great option and one which can be worn year after year thanks to its timeless elegance. V by Very's version in navy is a wardrobe classic.

And now is the perfect time to invest in some new knitwear. 

Cardigans are still a big trend, or we like this long star and stud detail jumper by Mint Velvet. 

Autumn fashion = heaven. 

5. The natural beauty

How can you NOT want to get out into this natural wonder?

Hazy summer days and long balmy evenings are wonderful but nothing beats the colours of fall.

All those beautiful golden leaves, whether still on branches or underfoot, are a gift from Mother Nature.

Setting off on an autumnal walk to drink it all in is such a joy. And let's not forget the satisfying crunch as we wade through big russet piles of them in the park.

Add in some autumnal mist and a smoking chimney on the horizon and you've got all the makings of a gorgeous afternoon. 

And of course, coming home from a long walk gazing at the red and gold canopies is rewarded by warming tea and a roaring fire.

Head out for a romp across the countryside in this Barbour wax jacket and look like a pro-hiker in these boots by Regatta.

6. The events of autumn 

Halloween is on the way and we can't wait...

Two of the most fun events of the year happen during autumn; Halloween and Bonfire Night. 

Halloween can be hilarious no matter your age. Whether you've got kids to entertain and take trick or treating or you're a grown up with a penchant for dressing up, it's just great to be a bit silly, wear something stupid and apply fake blood to your neck.

There are tonnes of brilliant Halloween recipes to try like meringue bones and witches fingers. Google them... they're super easy too. 

Carving pumpkins is just amazing and creating pumpkin displays is even better. Really go for it with a range of gourds and you'll soon get that cosy autumn feeling.

And you can get ahead on fancy dress shopping for the little ones now. How about the Hulk or a pirate?

Or just an old bed sheet with two holes cut out for eyes will do the trick. Genius! 

L-R: The Avengers Deluxe Hulk Costume (£28.99) and Child's Pirate Costume (£13.99) at Very

And then a few days later along comes Bonfire Night. 

Fireworks, jacket potatoes, Guy Fawkes; what's not to love? It's also one of the first times in the year it's acceptable to drink mulled wine, so... 

7. The accessories

As with the clothes, autumn accessories are the BEST.

For a start, the footwear is fabulous. Ankle boots, calf high boots, knee high boots, over the knee boots; just loads and loads of ultra gorgeous boots.

These suede boots by Mint Velvet are going on our wishlist straight away.

L-R: Accessorize Cord Mariner Cap (£18) and Accessorize Autumn Chevron Print Scarf (£20) at Very

And you can really complete your looks with hats, scarves and gloves too.

Nothing is cuter than a bobble hat but seeing as it's not freezing yet, why not opt for a baker boy style hat like this one by Accessorize instead?

And wrap this lovely chevron scarf around your neck or wear it as a shawl over your coat, for added texture and a touch of those warm autumnal hues.

8. Christmas is only weeks away 

Not long now...

Pretty much everyone loves Christmas, so why wouldn't you want to be just that bit closer to it?

And right now it's a mere 15 weeks away, which we know will go by in a flash.

Get a jump start on things and pick up some adorable personalised stockings to hang like this rocking horse design.

So, if for no other reason, that's why autumn is the best season of the year.
