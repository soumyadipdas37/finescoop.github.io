Arsenal players were put through their paces in an unusual way in training as Mikel Arteta's side prepared for their season opener against Fulham on Saturday.

New arrivals Gabriel and William Saliba were welcomed into the camp by being strapped with a long rope and buckles to returning loan star Dani Ceballos and Hector Bellerin during Tuesday's session.

With the Gunners bringing in a host of new faces this summer it appeared as though Arteta was keen his players to build their fitness and team spirit with the unorthodox method.

The Arsenal camp were all smiles as went through the session, with fellow new signing Willian also pictured following his arrival from Chelsea as well as talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

 Mesut Ozil was also pictured taking part, but there was no sign of last season's fellow outcast Matteo Guendouzi.

Bellerin trained with his team-mates fresh after revealing he has become League Two side Forest Green Rovers' second-largest stakeholder, while Emiliano Martinez, who has been linked with a move away to Aston Villa recently, was also present in the session, while

The Arsenal boss will be hoping to build on his first season at the north London club that culminated in winning the FA Cup. 

He has also tasted some silverware this campaign already after beating Liverpool in the Community Shield last month in the season curtain-raiser at Wembley.

Despite their success towards the end of 2019-20, Arteta has been keen to bolster his squad after a disappointing domestic campaign in which they finished eighth. 

Their trip to face the newly-promoted Cottagers on Saturday will be the first 2020-21 game to be played in England's top flight.
