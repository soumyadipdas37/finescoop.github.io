She's the former reality star-turned-influencer known for her jaw-dropping curves.

And on Sunday, Love Island's Shelby Bilby garnered attention with her latest photo shared to Instagram.

Soaking up the sun on a Gold Coast beach, the 26-year-old flaunted her ample cleavage, toned tummy and lean legs in a tiny pink bikini.

Shelby added a matching pink jacket to the swimwear ensemble, and ran one manicured hand through her wavy blonde tresses. 

She tilted her head, drawing attention to a glamorous beauty look, including bold brows, false lashes, contoured cheekbones and a pink colour on her plump pout.

'Soaking up that Vitamin D,' Shelby captioned the post.        

Instagram sensation: Shelby's Instagram page is littered with pictures in scantily clad attire

But Shelby has admitted her racy photos often create problems with Instagram's strict censorship policies.

In October last year, she revealed one of her photos had been removed by the social media app for being in breach of their nudity rules.

'Take #2 cause apparently me holding my boobs is "sexual activity" yet there is 7192929293 accounts way worse than mine,' Shelby captioned a photo of herself covering her naked breasts with her arms.

She added: 'What's wrong with a woman being confident in her own body? Stop being a prude and block yourself hun... Whyyyy you be like this @instagram? #Haters #JogOn.'

Shelby rose to fame as an intruder on the 2018 season of Love Island Australia, and has since become a social media influencer.
