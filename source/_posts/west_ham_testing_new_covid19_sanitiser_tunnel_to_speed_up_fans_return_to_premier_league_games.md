West Ham are the first club to trial a ground-breaking new Covid-19 sanitiser tunnel that could help in the effort to get fans back into stadiums safely.

The Hammers are testing the three-part Gateway Personal Protection Tunnel at their Chadwell Heath training base that is used by their development squad, U18s and women’s team.

The tunnel is similar to an airport scanner that people walk through. In the first part, a thermal imaging camera is used to record the person’s temperature.

They then move on to have their clothes lightly sprayed with a non-alcoholic, water-based sanitiser which neutralises bacteria and viruses before proceeding through the rest of the tunnel.

The tunnel, devised by CovProtex, will be used alongside existing safety measures already being implemented by clubs to reduce the spread of coronavirus. 

The trial remains in the early stages and how soon it could be rolled out and tested at football grounds has yet to be decided.

Clubs are working towards the return of fans from the beginning of October, subject to Government approval. 

Brighton hosted the first English game with fans since lockdown last month, when 2,500 were able to watch.
