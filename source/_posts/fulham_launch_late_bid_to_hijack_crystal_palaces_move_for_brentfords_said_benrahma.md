Fulham have moved to hijack Crystal Palace's swoop for Brentford attacker Said Benrahma.

The Eagles are advanced in their move for the Algeria international, but are yet to close a deal.

But west London rivals Fulham have now entered the race to land Benrahma - who was widely recognised as the best attacking player in the Championship last season.

Sportsmail understands representatives from the Craven Cottage club have been in touch with the player's advisors for an update on the status of Benrahma's protracted move to Palace, with a view to launching their own swoop.

Brentford value Benrahma close to £30million - a fee a number of clubs have been reluctant to meet.

His future will become clearer in the coming days, but there is no immediate rush to complete the deal before the October 5 transfer deadline. 

Benrahma can still complete his move to the top flight during an additional window for EFL transfers, which closes on October 11.  

Fulham defeated Brentford 2-1 in the Championship play-off final as Benrahma had an off day

The 25-year-old's sensational 2019-20 season saw Benrahma score 17 goals in 46 matches, including hat-tricks against Hull City and Wigan Athletic.

The former Nice man had fans of Premier League clubs sitting up and taking notice during a campaign in which he also notched up eight assists. 

Despite their free-flowing football, Brentford ultimately came up just short in their quest for promotion, losing 2-1 to Fulham in the Championship play-off final last month.
