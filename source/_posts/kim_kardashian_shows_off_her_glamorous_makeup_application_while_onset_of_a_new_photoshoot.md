She is the CEO of her own cosmetics company, KKW Beauty.

And Kim Kardashian put her make-up skills on display while getting ready for a glamorous photoshoot on Monday evening.

'I'm on set of a shoot and I just wanna show you guys that I did my whole eye with the new KKW x Allison eyeshadow palette,' began the 39-year-old on her Instagram Story.

She added that she 'smoked out [her] under eye' with a brown toned eyeshadow from the highly sought after palette.

Kardashian gave her younger sister Kylie Jenner's beauty brand Kylie Cosmetics a little plug, when she admitted that she 'used Kylie's lashes that she just dropped with her Sailor collection' on her eyes.

'I was impressed! I love these lashes. They look really pretty,' said the KUWTK star, as she turned her head for the camera and grazed the fluffy lashes with her finger.

Despite straying from her makeup line in the fake eyelash department, Kardashian stayed true to her brand for the rest of the look.

To achieve her plump put, Kim used the 'KKW Beauty Nude 2 lip liner' and just 'a little bit' of the London Lip Crayon, which she admitted is '[her] fave.'

Returning to her recently launched KKW Beauty x Allison collection, which dropped on August 28, Kardashian reached for 'the P.P.S. clear gloss to make her lips 'juicy.'

'So, I just like having a juicy lip no matter what,' she admitted, while generously applying the gloss to her lips.

Kim finished off the makeup look with a generous amount of bronzer, blush, and highlighter straight out of the Ladera palette from the KKW x Allison collection.

Before signing off her Instagram Story, the wife of Kanye West gave her 187million followers one last glimpse of her completed makeup application.

'It looks so cute,' remarked Kim as she blew a tender kiss to the camera.

In the string of clips, Kardashian had her lengthy brunette tresses styled in loose waves, while a set of clips kept strands of hair away from her face.

She had on only a white bathrobe and there was a clothing rack filled with various pieces from her SKIMS line.

Kim has been aggressively advertising her KKW x Allison collection, a collaboration with her childhood best friend Allison Statter, due to its sentimental value.

The packaging, as well the product names, are inspired by memories, inside jokes, and other special tokens the pair have collected over the span of their lifelong friendship.  

Although fans will have to wait to see Monday's photoshoot, Kim recently treated her devout following to a slew of stunning self-portraits she had taken, while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

For the sexy shoot, which was captured on the beach, Kim slipped her famous curves into a tiny hot pink string bikini.

Her hair was intricately styled into two braids that cascaded far past her chest, while using a smoky hue of eye shadow and bronze blush to amplify her facial features.

Happy place', Kim captioned the photo series, which saw her walking along the sand with her gym-honed physique on full display. 

Kim was spotted on the beaches of Cabo earlier this month taking these photos, which are said to be for her KWW beauty range.

The shoot occurred amid a tumultuous time for Kim and her husband Kanye West, who have been embroiled in marital drama since his wild presidential rally in South Carolina.
