Nightlife king Nick Russian and his influencer wife Rozalia could be Melbourne's new power couple if he decides to run for Lord Mayor and wins. 

Mr Russian was reportedly called by 'senior people within the Liberal Party' who asked him to run for Lord Mayor of Melbourne on Wednesday night.  

'I am certainly honoured to be approached to run. Small business has and will always be in my blood and I have worked in Melbourne for my whole life,' Mr Russian told The Herald Sun. 

'I will consider with my family in coming days.'

Mr Russian was reportedly called by 'senior people within the Liberal Party' who asked him to run for Lord Mayor of Melbourne on Wednesday night

The Liberal Party does not normally endorse local government candidates but is reportedly trying to take advantage of anti-Labor sentiment during Melbourne's Stage 4 lockdown. 

After taking a five-year break from Twitter, Mr Russian has returned to the platform during the lockdown by retweeting posts that are critical of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews.    

Melburnians are currently banned from dining in at hospitality venues under the lockdown and can only use takeaway or delivery options. 

'Rebuilding business must be a key to the city's recovery and Nick (Russian) has the runs on the board and respect for this,' a Liberal Party insider told The Herald Sun.   

The hospitality honcho is married to ballerina-turned-influencer Rozalia Russian (pictured), who has more than 255,000 followers on Instagram.

Mr and Mrs Russian tied the knot in 2013 and share two children - daughter Willow, 6, and son Kingston, 3 

The father-of-two used to run popular nightclub Eve Bar, where he met celebrities like Kanye West and Britney Spears, before selling the venue in 2015. 

He now runs Together Events, which is 'a luxury lifestyle and events brand created for sophisticated, fun and fashion conscious individuals'. 

The hospitality honcho is married to ballerina-turned-influencer Rozalia Russian, who has more than 255,000 followers on Instagram. 

She has collaborated with brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton and L'Oréal Paris. 

Mr and Mrs Russian tied the knot in 2013 and share two children - daughter Willow, 6, and son Kingston, 3.  

Candidate nominations for the city council election begin on September 17 while the election period kicks of five days later on September 22. 

Mr Russian is yet to formally confirm he will be running.
