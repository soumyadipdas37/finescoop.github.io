Declan Donnelly has revealed that he wanted to quit acting aged 11 and become a priest when he was turned down for the lead role in the kids' show Geordie Racer.

The TV presenter, 44, who is one half of the duo Ant and Dec, described how he almost turned his back on showbiz after being rejected from the children's series.  

The star told how he 'briefly considered' following the career of his brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, who even conducted Dec's wedding to Ali Astall in 2015.

Dec, who fronts TV shows Britain's Got Talent and I'm a Celebrity alongside Anthony McPartlin, 44, revealed he made a 'momentous decision' after his failed audition. 

In an extract, according to The Mirror, from his first autobiography with Ant, Ooh! What a Lovely Pair, he wrote: 'After that crushing rejection, I made a momentous decision: that was it - I was going to retire from acting. I was eleven.' 

And Dec, who is the youngest of seven children, described how he contemplated turning to religion after his audition didn't go to plan.

He continued: 'Later on, when I was about fourteen, I did briefly consider following in his footsteps, and the footsteps of my Godfather, Father O'Connell, and becoming a priest.' 

However the Geordie star described how he 'knew right there' that the career was not for him when he travelled home from school on a bus which was 'full of lasses'. 

Dec landed the role of Duncan in Byker Grove in 1989 after a producer from Geordie Racer wrote to the young star and encouraged him to continue acting. 

Along with Ant, who joined the set as PJ in 1990, the pair went on to become pop sensations as PJ & Duncan, before settling into their roles as a hosting duo.

It comes after Britain's Got Talent returned on Sunday night to reveal the final 40 acts through to the semi-finals.
