On Sunday she stepped out for the photocall of the Miu Miu Women's Tales short film series.

And Nathalie Emmanuel was keen to continue her promotional tour for the release as she stepped out in a shirt from the brand when she arrived in style at the Revenge Room premiere on Monday.

The Game of Thrones star, 31, put on a stylish display in the white logo t-shirt which she paired with a sleek blue skirt for a casually chic look.

Nathalie boosted her height in a pair of sparkling silver heels, and complemented her look by accessorising with a silver cross-body bag.

Her brunette locks were styled in natural curls that framed her face well, and she added a glittering touch to the look by wearing a pair of pearl earrings. 

Nathalie went solo for the event, after previously being seen in Venice with her actor beau, Alex Lanipekun.

The thespian couple were rumoured to be dating in 2018, and news of their relationship became official when they were seen putting on a loved up display at the Ischia Film Festival in Italy that same year. 

They have been spotted at multiple events since, but they prefer to keep their relationship private and out of the limelight.

Prior to her relationship with Alex, Nathalie was linked to Devon Anderson who is known for playing Billie Jackson in EastEnders.

They met on set of the soap drama, Hollyoaks, where Nathalie joined the cast in 2006 to play Sasha Valentine and she quickly rose to fame. 

She was kept busy with her first major role as her character battled heroin addiction and turned to prostitution. 

Nathalie appeared on the soap until 2010 and went onto land roles in blockbuster films such as Maze Runner, Furious 7 from the Fast & Furious franchise.

Quiet: Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis
