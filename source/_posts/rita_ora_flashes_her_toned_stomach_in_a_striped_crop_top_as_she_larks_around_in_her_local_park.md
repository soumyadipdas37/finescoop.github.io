She often pushes the boundaries of fashion with her red carpet looks and stage ensembles. 

But Rita Ora donned a laid-back outfit on Sunday as she ventured outside for a breath of fresh air in the British countryside. 

The Black Widow hitmaker, 29, looked effortlessly stylish in a striped top as she beamed in a series of candid snaps for her social media while encouraging her followers to follow her lead and 'spend time with yourself'.

She exposed her washboard stomach in a cropped polo neck top which she paired with black leggings. 

Her blonde tresses tumbled past her shoulders in a tousled loose curl.

Rita protected her eyes from the setting sun with a pair of classic black shades and she let her natural beauty shine through with minimal makeup.

The contemplative singer said to her followers: 'Just remember to go outside to breathe in the fresh air even in the midst of work spend time with yourself do what makes you feel good don’t worry what others may think of you. 

'Just like people in this park thought I was crazy taking these socially distant photos and smiling and jumping around on my own but who cares...Be YOU.'

Her pal and former TOWIE star, Vas J Morgan shared his agreement as he commented: 'Facts'.

Vera Wang also shared her support for Rita with a series of emojis while one fan declared: 'I LOVE YOU,' and another one wrote: 'Okay no way you're this perfect.'

Last month, Rita headed to Capri in Italy for her first socially-distanced event since the pandemic began.

She fulfilled her ambassador duties and performed at LuisaViaRoma for UNICEF ball which took place at La Certosa di San Giacomo.

At the star-studded charity event, she donned a floral embroidered semi-sheer gown and made sure all eyes were on her for the red carpet. 

She wore a panelled corset that was peppered with intricate floral and sequin embroidery.

Wrapped over the top was strategically placed sheer fabric with glistening sequin stripes that bent around her curves and accentuated her hourglass physique.

The show-stopping number trailed along the floor and draped over Rita's shoulder as she delivered the perfect pose to camera.  

Rita opted for an equally decorative shoe as she was seen wearing diamond encrusted heels.

She wore an elegant pair of silver teardrop earrings with rose-coloured jewels that complimented her makeup pallet of pink hues.

Rita also kept her highlighted blonde tresses in a chic updo. 

The 29-year-old commented on the event from her Twitter account: 'My first event and carpet since lockdown!!!'
