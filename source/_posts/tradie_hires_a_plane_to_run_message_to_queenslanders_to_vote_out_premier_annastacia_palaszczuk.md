An enraged landscape gardener has paid $2,000 out of his own pocket to fly a banner reading 'vote her out' over the Gold Coast in a dig at embattled Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. 

John McInerney was furious after Canberra woman Sarah Caisip was banned from attending her father's funeral on Thursday.

Ms Caisip was allowed to view her father's body but was forced to wear full PPE, even though the ACT has not recorded a new case of coronavirus in 60 days. 

Ms Palaszczuk goes to the polls on October 31, but Mr McInerney has urged his fellow Queenslanders to vote her out. 

'I think the Queensland premier is doing a horrendous job,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I know it is difficult – I don’t think anyone would know how to deal with this. 

'However, there are such double standards. People with money are given access while people with medical conditions cant get a look in.'  

Last month Ms Palaszczuk said 'Queensland hospitals are for Queenslanders' , a comment which Mr McInerney branded 'disgusting'.  

Mr McInerney said the final straw for him was when Ms Palaszczuk blamed the decision not to allow Ms Caisip to her father's funeral on the chief medical officer.

'She should be able to overrule a bureaucrat. They don’t run the state. For her to say decision is not hers to make, she is not worthy of running a state,' he said.

Mr McInerney said he initially wanted to fly the banner on the AFL Grand Final weekend and before the election, but yesterday's news tipped him over the edge.

The gardener started a GoFundMe called Vote Her Out to help raise money to fly the banner daily.    

Even Prime Minister Scott Morrison has taken aim at Ms Palaszcusk's border policy, which bans people from Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT entering the state.

Ms Caisip applied for an exemption last month to visit her sick father Bernard Prendergast in Brisbane - but it took 20 days to get approved and he died of liver cancer two days before her flight.  

The prime minister had asked Ms Palaszczuk to make an exception but the premier refused and accused him of 'bullying and intimidating' her. 

'I said to the Prime Minister, I would refer it to the chief health officer and I did that,' Ms Palaszczuk said on Friday morning.

'It's her decision... you've got to take the clinical advice here. We're dealing with a health pandemic. It is absolutely tragic. It is heartbreaking.'

The refusal sparked outrage across the country, and in the end Ms Caisip was only granted a private viewing of his body, surrounded by guards and forbidden from seeing her shattered mother and 11-year-old sister. 

Mr Morrison, who lost his own father in January, choked back tears as he described the case as 'heartbreaking' in a radio interview.
