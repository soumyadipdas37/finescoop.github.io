Saracens insist they are ready to ride another wave of controversy after Owen Farrell was banned for their Euro dynasty match against Leinster.

The Champions Cup is Saracens' last hope of silverware before they are relegated, having been found guilty of breaching the salary cap.

Talisman Owen Farrell has been banned for the Dublin quarter-final but flanker Jackson Wray insists the club are ready to deal with the latest setback.

'We're gutted to have lost Owen but it's up to us now to go and do what we need to do,' said Wray. 'With or without the lockdown break, this is the game we've been looking for.

'With everything that's gone on with us this season and losing Owen now and having to go over there, there is an element of being the underdog. We don't mind that. Whatever comes, whether it's bans, 35-point bans, 105-point bans, our environment only gets better. You either roll over or you get tougher.

'No one's particularly liked us that much over the years. We're used to it.'
