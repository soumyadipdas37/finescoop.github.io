Grant Denyer and his wife Chezzi recently announced that they are expecting their third child in March 2021.

And on Wednesday night, Chezzie Denyer shared an adorable update on her pregnancy.

Posting to Instagram, the 40-year-old expectant mum shared a short clip of the baby's sonogram at 19 weeks and explained that she and Grant are 'so excited'.

'Got to see our little growing bubba today.. Shed a few tears of happiness,' she captioned the clip.  

'We are just so excited - such a special time in our house... We’ve waited so long for this moment and we are cherishing every step! And look at that little button nose.'

Chezzi's sweet update comes after she was left outraged after receiving rude comments from strangers about her decision to have a child at 40.

Taking to Instagram last month, the mum-of-three shared several examples of the disgraceful comments she's received from strangers in her hometown of Bathurst. 

She wrote: 'I am 40 years old and having a baby... I live in country NSW and get comments like... "Why would you at your age?" "Was it an accident?" "Are you worried something will be wrong with the baby?"' 

Former TV producer Chezzi, who shares daughters Scout, four, and Sailor, eight, with her husband, explained that despite the negativity in her local area, she has received plenty of positive messages from friends living in other parts of Australia.

'But on the flip side, many of my friends 40+ living in Sydney or Melbourne are only now trying to have their first child,' she explained.

She then added that she feels more 'calm and confident' this time round and she credits that to her age. 

'There's something you don't have when you're really young and that is wisdom.. and my ripe old age of 40 I feel I have plenty,' she concluded.
