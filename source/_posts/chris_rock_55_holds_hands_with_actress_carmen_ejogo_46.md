The Kensington native was married to Tricky in 1998 and she was wed to actor Jeffrey Wright from 2000 to 2014 after meeting on the set of Boycott. Their children are Juno and Elijah Wright.

She began her career as host of the Saturday Disney morning show from 1993 to 1995. Carmen is best known for her work on The Avengers, Love's Labour's Lost and What's the Worst That Could Happen. Her last big hit was True Detective and her next project is Your Honor.

This comes just a week after he said he had been diagnosed with nonverbal learning disorder.

The early days of a new romance for the two? This is the first time the lovebirds have been photographed together

The comedian has revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that he struggles to understand non-verbal signals made in conversations, which he says is great for comedy and writing jokes but not more 'one-on-one relationships'.

 'And all I understand are the words. By the way, all of those things are really great for writing jokes - they're just not great for one-on-one relationships. And I'd always just chalked it up to being famous,' said the funny man, adding he has seven hours of therapy a week.

'Any time someone would respond to me in a negative way, I'd think, 'Whatever, they're responding to something that has to do with who they think I am.' Now, I'm realizing it was me. A lot of it was me.'

 Rock underwent 'nine hours of tests' to uncover his Non-Verbal Learning Disorder (NVLD). He had to sit through 'a battery of tests' before doctors could confidently diagnose him.

He said: '[I took] a battery of tests, like nine hours of tests. They came back and said, "You don't have Asperger's, but you have something very close to it, and it's called NVLD, Non-Verbal Learning Disorder."

'One of the things is, I have a hard time picking up social cues. Like when I talk to people, I hear the words, but if you're mad at me, if you're feeling a certain way, I might have a hard time picking that up.'

Chris also explained that receiving the diagnosis has helped him 'relax', as he used to suffer with anxiety because he knew something was wrong with him but couldn't pinpoint what it was.

Speaking during an appearance on The View, he added: 'I used to have a squirrel-like energy … you can't sneak up on a squirrel, it's always alert, he's scared all the time. And that's gone. I'm much more relaxed now.' 

 Chris also admitted to HR he has never really 'dealt' with his childhood trauma. He added: 'I'm not belittling today's youth, but I wish somebody had sent me a bad text when I was a kid. These m************ were trying to kill me ... I thought I was actually dealing with it, and the reality is I never dealt with it. 

'The reality was the pain and the fear that brought me, I was experiencing it every day.'

Chris has also been learning to swim during lockdown.

Hard for him: The star said the disorder was 'great for writing jokes - they're just not great for one-on-one relationships'; seen in 2019 with Megalyn Echikunwoke whom he split with earlier this year

His former wife: In 2014 he split from wife of four years Malaak Compton-Rock; their divorce was finalized in 2016. Seen in 2010

He shared: 'Do you know how f****** hard it is for a grown-up to learn how to swim? You've got to not be scared to die. 

'The other day, this guy says to me, 'OK, you're going to dive into the deep end and swim to the other side,' and I'm like, 'Are you f****** crazy?

'But then I dove into the deep end and I swam to the other side, and it's a metaphor for what I've been trying to do during this time.'
