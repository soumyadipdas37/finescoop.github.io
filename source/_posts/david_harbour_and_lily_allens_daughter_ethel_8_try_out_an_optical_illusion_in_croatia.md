He's recently returned from a sun-soaked getaway in Croatia with girlfriend Lily Allen and her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven.

And David Harbour was in good spirits as he took part in an amusing optical illusion trick with Ethel in an Instagram video from the trip, which he shared on Tuesday.

The Stranger Things star, 45, was seen sitting in what appeared to be a large black-and-white chair that made him look small compared to Lily's eldest child.

Ethel called out to her sister Marnie to ask if she was 'ready' and after her sister confirmed that they were she shouted 'look' and pointed at the star.

David played along with the illusion as he smiled and waved at the camera whilst sat in the chair, which was actually a cushion placed against the far wall with black bars set down further into the room to make it look like a large chair.

Enjoying the day out, David joked in the caption: '(Insert name of Vegas mid-level magician here) EAT YOUR HEART OUT!'

Over the past two weeks, the couple had been seen soaking up the sunshine during their break with Lily's daughters, who she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper.

Under new government guidelines, the singer will have to quarantine for 14 days upon her arrival back in the UK due to tightening travel restrictions in COVID-19 hit areas across Europe.
