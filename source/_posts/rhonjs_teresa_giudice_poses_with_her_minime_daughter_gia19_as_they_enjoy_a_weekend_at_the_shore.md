Real Housewives Of New Jersey veteran Teresa Giudice has had a stressful few months between losing her beloved father and adjusting to homeschooling her kids during the pandemic. 

On Monday the 48-year-old mother of four got some leisure time as she was seen with her eldest daughter Gia at the Jersey Shore.

The reality TV star and her 19-year-old mini me posed on a dock as both placed their hands on their hips for the snap. Teresa captioned the image, 'Forever my baby girl.'

Teresa looked the picture of shore glam, showing off her toned body in a plunging fitted white dress and a pair of studded wedges. 

She accessorized her outfit with a turquoise head scarf, her classic sunglasses and a oversized hoop earrings as the Bravo veteran looked ready for a tropical vacation. 

Gia, who has been back from Rutgers college since the spring, showed off her equally sun-kissed skin next to her mother, rocking a baby blue snakeskin bikini and her blonde locks down. The teen put her flat stomach on display as she smiled and lightly popped her foot for the camera.  

When it comes to posing, the two clearly take their cues from each other. In another post earlier this summer, the mother-daughter duo stand in virtually the same fashion as they smile for the beachside snap.

Four girls: Teresa is the mother to four daughters Gia, 19, Gabriella, 16, Milania, 15, and Adriana, 11. Their father Joe Giudice was deported back to Italy after 36 months in prison after pleading guilty to mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud 

Though the world is still shutdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic both Gia and Teresa have been trying to slowly ease back into normal life. 

Despite the fact that college classes will be offered remotely with the exception of several academic disciplines for the majority of US universities, Gia seems to be enjoying her time at home with her mom and sisters, Gabriella, 16, Milania, 15, and Adriana, 11.

Recently the teen was candid on social media about having her nose done, posting that she had 'never been happier' in her own skin. A few weeks later she was seen spending time in Los Angeles with friends and her boyfriend despite the ongoing pandemic.

Teresa has had a rough year after cameras followed her battle with estranged husband, Joe Giudice, who was deported to Italy after 36 months in prison. 

Season 11 of the show began filming on July 20 after stopping in March meaning that the infamous Jersey pot stirrer is back to work.

Teresa recently revealed that she will allow the show to film her dating around now that the drama with her ex-husband has subsided. 

Prior to the pandemic she had been seen hanging with a handful of young men on casual outings despite never publicly confirming any romances.
