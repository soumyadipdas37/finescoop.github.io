Fans of The Bachelor are convinced that Irena Srbinovska is going to win Locky Gilbert's heart during Thursday night's finale.

And while she is the clear favourite as of Wednesday, there is still a chance that Bella Varelis could swoop in and steal her crown.

As longtime viewers will know, the bookies aren't always right when it comes to who wins The Bachelor - and this was memorably the case during the 2016 season.

What if we're all wrong about Bella? The Bachelor's resident 'villain' Bella Varelis could still win Locky Gilbert's heart despite the odds not being in her favour - because it's happened before

In the days leading up to Richie Strahan's dramatic season finale, runner-up Nikki Gogan was the odds-on favourite.

As reported by Daily Mail Australia at the time, a leading online betting agency was offering $1.70 for Nikki being the outright winner.

The eventual winner, single mother Alex Nation, was sitting on longer odds $2.05 - despite having been the favourite earlier in the season.

It's not over yet: While Irena Srbinovska (pictured) is the clear favourite as of Wednesday, there is still a chance that Bella could swoop in and steal her crown

But the bookmakers were wrong: Richie ended up picking single mother Alex, and left real estate agent Nikki heartbroken.

This shock twist raises the possibility that the bookies - and much of the Australian media - have got this year's outcome wrong, too.

According to Sportsbet, 31-year-old recovery nurse Irena is the clear favourite as of Wednesday morning with odds of $1.27.

Surprise! As longtime viewers will know, the bookies aren't always right when it comes to who wins The Bachelor - and this was memorably the case during the 2016 season. Despite being tipped for runner-up, Alex Nation (left) ended up winning Richie Strahan's (right) heart

By contrast, Instagram influencer Bella, 25, is tipped for runner-up ($3.50) and intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25, is expected to place third ($9).

HR consultant Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, is likely to be the first to go when finale week kicks off on Wednesday, with odds of $21.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
