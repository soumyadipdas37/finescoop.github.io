Colombian authorities have arrested four members of a sex trafficking ring and rescued four girls rescued four girls who were being held by them. 

The Office of Attorney General said the suspects were forcing adult and underage women, many of them migrants from Venezuela, into prostitution at a bar in the southern Bogotá town of Bosa. 

Authorities confiscated a cellphone from one of the suspects and learned of a September 2019 incident in which one of the male suspects recorded a young girl being brutalized and tortured.

In the gruesome video - which the Daily Mail has decided not to republish - the girl is seen sitting on a bed with pliers gripping her feet and her hair cut off. 

One man behind the camera them brandishes a drill in front of her face and threatens to kill her.

The punishment was allegedly in retribution for the girl telling a bar customer that the owners were selling fake liquor and drugs.

A cellphone seized by the police in Colombia showed a girl from Venezuela being threatened with a drill by members of a sex trafficking ring. The underage girl was one of many who were promised employment at the bar before they were forced to have sex with customers. The girl later  managed to escape her captors and returned to Venezuela.

A male accomplice then smacked the girl and told her, 'why didn't you cry when you went snitching?' 

The man behind the cellphone camera then said, 'let's kill her with the drill,' before the other suspect pointed the drill at the terrified girl's face.

Footage recorded by the Colombian National Police showed the moment the suspects were captured Sunday after a judge granted an arrest warrant after gathering testimony from the four girls and surveillance camera footage near the bar.

The suspects were identified as Silvia Yaney Castañeda and Danilo Pacheco, both Colombian nationals. The cops also apprehended Exyerin David Vargas and Leonardo Jesús Vargas, both of Venezuela.

All four suspects were charged with with human trafficking, torture and instigating prostitution.

Exyerin David Vargas (left) and Leonardo Jesús Vargas (right) were reportedly responsible for recruiting the victims and promising them employment at a bar in Bogotá, Colombia, before they obligated them to have sex with bar patrons. The girls were paid a small fraction of the money that was collected 

Investigators claim the four were responsible for recruiting the victims and promising them employment at the bar. 

They then forced girls to have sex with customers and received a portion of the moneys paid to the traffickers. The victims were also obligate to meet a certain quota and were required to work additional hours if they failed to meet the traffickers' expectations.

A police spokesman said all four girls have since returned to Venezuela. The girl who appeared in the frightening video managed to escape her captors and also returned to Venezuela.
