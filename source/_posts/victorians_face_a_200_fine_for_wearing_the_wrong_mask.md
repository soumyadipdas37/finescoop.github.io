A Victorian politician exploded with rage on live TV as he slammed Daniel Andrews over his new rules on masks.

Liberal MP Tim Smith said 'we're being muzzled like dogs' after the premier announced $200 fines for anyone not wearing a fitted face mask in public.

The strict rule means bandanas, scarfs and face shields are no longer acceptable.

Mr Smith, shadow housing minister, told Sky News the rule is unfair on people whose glasses fog up if they wear a fitted mask and said face shields should still be allowed.

Wearing a mask with the word 'Dandemic' inscribed, he said: 'For many people - when they try to go walking as part of their two hours' exercise - their glasses fog up and they can't see where they are going.

'I mean my poor old dad needs to wear one of these shields when he's walking because his glasses fog up and he can't see where he is going.'

'We're being muzzled like dogs because of the Labor Party's incompetence. 

Holding up a face shield, he added: 'I'm happy to wear a mask in the supermarket or on public transport - that makes perfect sense - but why can't we wear these while we're walking outside? It's stupid.'

After Mr Smith's furious outburst, Labor councillor Nicholas Reece told him the reason behind the rule was that health experts believe fitted masks are safer. 

Premier Andrews said on Sunday: 'With more people moving across our city, our public health team have advised the rules around wearing a mask need to be strengthened.' 

Mr Smith also said Victoria's 9pm curfew, which was lifted on Monday morning, should have been removed months ago because it was 'disproportionate'.

Victoria suffered on five news cases of coronavirus on Monday after Mr Andrews announced a faster road map for relaxing restrictions which potentially ends lockdown in Melbourne on 19 October instead of 26 October.

The latest deaths take the state toll to 787 and the national figure to 875.

But there were only 6,807 new tests and authorities want to start testing more residents in high risk industries such as aged care and meatworks. 

The premier has said repeatedly that tests must stay high for officials to be confident in easing restrictions.

Jeroen Weimar from the Department of Health and Human Services said he was concerned about testing levels across outer regional Victoria.

He said also waste water testing had been expanded and there were now 23 sampling sites across the state.

Mr Weimar said the department had trialled saliva testing with 1,000 Victoria Police officers and picked up one positive case in the Dandenong station.

Mr Weimar said more than 16,000 people in the Dandenong area had been tested in the past two to three weeks, with a 50 per cent increase in one week.

The outbreak has reached 44 cases across eight households.

'It hasn't spread beyond those households,' he said.

Melbourne's all-important rolling new case average is now down to 20.3 and is at 0.6 for regional areas.

There were just 31 cases with an unknown source in Melbourne on September 12-25 and none outside the city.
