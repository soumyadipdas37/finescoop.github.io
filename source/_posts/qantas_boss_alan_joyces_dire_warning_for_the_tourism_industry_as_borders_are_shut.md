Coronavirus lockdowns and strict border restrictions are expected to cost Australia's tourism industry at least $54.6billion this financial year, new data has shown.

Modelling by Tourism Research Australia predicted Australia's tourism industry will be worth $83.8billion in 2020-21, some $54.6billion less than in 2019.

The modelling assumed the industry will lose $31.4billion due to international border restrictions and that domestic tourism will decline by at least $23.2billion. 

Queensland's border closure is estimated to cost local businesses $17million a day in lost income. 

In normal times, tourism directly and indirectly employs one million Australians, accounting for one in 12 jobs.

The data, compiled in May and released by Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham today, assumed that domestic borders would begin to open from June 2020.

It predicted that if state borders were to remain closed for the December quarter, tourism stands lose a further $9.8billion in interstate travel. 

Senator Birmingham released the figures ahead of Friday's national cabinet meeting where Scott Morrison will urge premiers to open their borders.

He has ordered health experts to come up with a definition of a hotspot to guide states on managing their border restrictions. 

It comes as Qantas boss Alan Joyce demands a science-based approach to state border closures. 

 'At the moment there seems to be no fact-based criteria about which borders are opening and closing,' he said at Wednesday's CAPA Centre for Aviation industry summit.

'I hope in national cabinet on Friday we start defining hotspots, which is then putting the science in play.

'Then we have certainty and all those businesses have certainty when borders will open and when they will close.'

Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah agreed, saying: 'I do support Alan Joyce on his urging for medical fact-based decision making around borders. 

'It doesn't really make sense to have two basically COVID-free cities not being able to connect with each other.'

Mr Joyce said he feared hundreds of small businesses in tourism towns such as Cairns would be forced to close.   

Qantas is operating 20 per cent of its flights before COVID-19 after predicting in June the figure would be 40 per cent.

State premiers will struggle to reach a nationwide agreement on a definition of a coronavirus hotspot, Victoria's chief health officer said on Wednesday.

Professor Brett Sutton said hotspots were a 'vexed issue' and 'every jurisdiction will come to its own threshold.' 

Mr Morrison wants a national definition so that Australians can see if border closures are proportionate and fair. 

'We need to get borders open, taking into account health advice that is conveyed transparently,' Mr Morrison said on Friday.

The issue will be discussed at Friday's national cabinet meeting but Professor Sutton said a hotspot was very difficult to define and every state will have its own opinion.

Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there

NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction

Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT

Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine

South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open

Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine

Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption 

'Every jurisdiction will have their own threshold in that regard, and it is up to them to make a call and come to a common view,' he said on Wednesday.

The prime minister is keen to get state borders open to boost the economy as Australia's suffers its first recession since 1991. 

Western Australia and Tasmania are closed to all states and Queensland is not letting anyone from NSW or the ACT cross the border, even if they are from areas with no cases.

Mr Morrison on Friday said he feared state premiers were forgetting the federation and 'retreating into provincialism.'    

Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said: 'Inconsistent and disproportionate approaches to border restrictions by some states and territories will continue to cause job losses in parts of our tourism industry.

'Our airlines, airports, hotels and tour operators rely on people doing more than taking a short self-drive holiday and we risk more job losses in these sectors if borders remain shut any longer than is necessary.

'I urge all state and territory leaders to take a sensible and proportionate approach to border restrictions, as getting more Australians travelling interstate will help save tourism businesses and jobs.

'Getting Australians travelling across parts of our country that have successfully suppressed the spread of Covid-19 will be critical to getting elements of our tourism industry back on its feet.'
