She's the dark horse going into the final week of The Bachelor.

And while Izzy Sharman-Firth may not have the best odds at the moment, she insists her connection with leading man Locky Gilbert is stronger than producers would have you believe.

Despite having the least amount of screen time out of the top four, the 29-year-old HR adviser claims she had several intimate moments with Locky in the mansion - but they weren't show on TV.

Don't write her off yet! Despite having the least amount of screen time out of the final four, The Bachelor's Izzy Sharman-Firth claims she had several intimate moments with Locky Gilbert

She told TV Week that 'things moved really quickly' between her and Locky, 31, after they returned to the mansion following three and a half months of lockdown.

Izzy went on to reveal that the pair 'shared a few kisses the other girls didn't know about' and also had in-depth conversations that didn't make the edit.

'Locky opened up about how strongly he felt towards me, and quite a few times told me he was falling for me,' she added.

As The Bachelor heads into finale week, Izzy is the least likely to win Locky's heart - with Sportsbet offering long odds of $15 as of Monday. 

By contrast, Irena Srbinovska is the favourite ($1.30), Bella Varelis is tipped for runner-up ($3.25) and intruder Bec Cvilikas is expected to place third ($7.50).

Meanwhile, Locky confirmed on Monday he was still dating his winning contestant.

The former Australian Survivor star, 31, told TV Week he was '110,000 per cent in love' with his chosen lady and 'can't wait to tell people how great she is'.

While Locky admitted he hadn't 'been able to catch up much' with his girlfriend since shooting the finale in July, he made it clear they were still together.

Looking to the future, he concluded: 'It will be amazing [after Thursday] to just be in public together and have a normal relationship. It seems small, but I can't wait to just go for a walk together and grab a coffee.

'I'm over the moon and can't wipe the smile off my face. I couldn't be happier and can't wait to share it with the world.'

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
