There may be a new furry member of the Kardashian clan. 

And Kourtney Kardashian cuddled up to the adorable puppy named Ruby, while chronicling it on her Instagram stories. 

The 41-year-old reality TV star continued to document her Wednesday afternoon as she went on to reunite with her good friend Sarah Howard.

Kourtney sat at a table in a blue tee with the adorable small puppy in her lap looking at the camera. 

'Hi Ruby,' she simply captioned the photo, though it's not clear who the little puppy belongs to. 

The mother-of-three looked glamorous with a full face of makeup drawing up her cheekbones and a nude color making her pout look more full. 



She went on to change her outfit, opting for a leather collard short sleeve top instead. 

Kourtney cuddled up to her longtime friend Sarah, who was a high school classmate. 

Earlier in the day, she hinted that she looked like an alien as she posed in a strapless cream colored top with matching slacks for a bathroom mirror selfie.

'Greetings earthlings,' was all the mother of three said in her brief caption.

Indeed the sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian did slightly resemble an alien emoji as her hair was slicked back and she had on heavy eye makeup that gave her a cat-eye look.

Her expression was also flat with zero human expression.

This comes after a report she has not reunited with ex Scott Disick. 

While the KUWTK star and her former partner of nine years, 37, have been spending more time together since he called it quits from Lionel Richie's 21-year-old daughter Sofia last month, sources claim the friendly exes will never reunite.

The insider added that they are maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship for the sake of their children Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five.

They told TMZ: 'They're are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia. 

'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both. 

'The kids had a blast [during their recent trip to Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho] and Scott and Kourtney realised it's good for the fam and they want to do more of it.'
