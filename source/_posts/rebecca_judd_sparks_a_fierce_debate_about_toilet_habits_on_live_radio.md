Most ordinary people don't care to think about how others use the toilet.

But Rebecca Judd apparently finds the topic fascinating, and sparked a fierce debate this week about the correct method of wiping.

The wife of AFL great Chris Judd said on KIIS FM's 3pm Pick-Up on Tuesday: 'Did you know that people wipe their bottoms differently? Some sit; some stand.'

Her co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond replied: 'What do you mean, stand?'

Rebecca, 37, continued: 'Yeah, I know. I was like, "What, what, what?" Obviously you sit and you wipe.

'So I asked my son Oscar, "How do you do it?" And he goes, "I always stand."'

While Rebecca was surprised by this, Monty said it wasn't unusual because a lot of 'little kids' stand up and bend over to wipe after using the toilet.

But she and Rebecca both agreed it was extremely unusual for an adult to use this impractical - and potentially messy - method.

Most people use the sit-down-and-tilt-to-the-side method, they said.

Later in the show, Monty and Rebecca were shocked to learn that one of their KIIS FM producers, Mel, prefers the stand-up method.

'I stand. I thought everybody did,' said Mel. 'You tilt a little bit. I don't understand how you get your hand through [sitting down].'

Rebecca explained that most people find a way to reach around by shifting forwards and across slightly on the toilet seat.

Monty said this was a 'high-risk' method, and Rebecca noted that she'd be worried about things 'dropping down and landing not in the bowl'. 

The former Nine weather presenter added that her husband, Chris, used the stand-up method until his early twenties, then 'became a sitter'.
