She shot to fame back in 2010 with hit single Skinny Genes.

And a decade on Eliza Doolittle proved she still has all the makings of a pop star as she posed up a storm during a photoshoot in London on Wednesday.

The Big When I Was Little singer, 32, looked nothing short of sensational for the shoot as she showcased her lithe figure and trademark edgy style.

Eliza was making the most of her stunning frame as she donned a neon yellow mini skirt beneath a pinstripe blazer and paired with boots.

She opted to forego wearing a top underneath the blazer, meaning her bare chest was on full display while the blazer also nipped in at her waist.

Despite the descending chill in the capital, she went bared-legged in the ensemble while donning a pair of tartan print ankle boots. 

In a nod to the bang on-trend clashing patterns style, the red tartan in her boots clashed against the pinstripe while the neon stood out boldly.

She wore her lengthy locks in loose curls with a balayage colour worked through, with dark roots and a lighted colour running the tips. 

Her glowing complexion stole the show as she went for an extremely natural make-up look to make the most of her pretty features.  

Eliza shot to fame with debut single Skinny Genes in April 2010, which was quickly followed by UK top 5 hit Pack Up.

In 2018, she discussed her meteroic rise to fame and her battle for control with record bosses with Wonderland Magazine, saying: ''I was 17 when I got signed and swooped up into the industry side of things...

It was really fun and exciting, you know; we were hustling, we were doing this pop thing. But, I always found myself coming head to head with them, and feeling like I wasn’t being true to myself in one way or another...

'In the end it wasn’t for me, I’m too controlling, and I want to be able to make music the way I want to do it.'
