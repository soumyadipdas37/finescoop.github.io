More tributes have been left to the tragic six-year-old girl who was killed by a falling tree.

Ella Henderson was rushed to hospital on Friday afternoon after being injured at Gosforth Park First School.

Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were sent to the scene and she was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment.

Sadly she died on Saturday morning.

Tributes describe Ella as a beautiful little girl as her mother Vikki raises thousands for charity

Flowers had already been left at the school over the weekend and now dozens more tributes have appeared.

Children's paintings of rainbows and teddy bears now sit alongside bunches of sunflowers and colourful roses.

One tribute reads: 'Bright and beautiful flowers for a beautiful little girl'.

Ella's mother Vikki Henderson has already raised more than £40,000 for the air ambulance charity which tried to save her daughter's life.

In a post on her Facebook page, she wrote: 'This is not a post I thought I would ever be writing my birthday this year, I'm asking for donations to Great North Air Ambulance Service.

'I've chosen this charity because their mission means a lot to me, and I hope that you'll consider contributing as a way of celebrating with me.

'Every little bit will help me reach my goal.'

More than 2,000 people have donated to Vikki's cause who was reportedly due to celebrate her 40th birthday this weekend. 

Great North Air Ambulance Service said it was 'overwhelmed by the response to Vikki's fundraiser'.

A source told the Daily Express: 'Vikki's actions in setting up the page, and everyone's generosity in supporting it, will mean other people can benefit from the care of our team.

'Our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragedy.'

Gosforth Park First School's headteacher said there will be extra support for staff and pupils in the wake of the tragedy.

'As a school and community, we will take the time to mourn and are putting in place extra support for the staff and pupils who are devastated by this incident.

'We would ask that people respect the privacy of the grieving family and the school as we work to understand exactly how this happened.'
