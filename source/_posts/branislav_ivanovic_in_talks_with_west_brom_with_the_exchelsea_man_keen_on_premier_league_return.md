Former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic is reportedly in talks with newly-promoted West Brom, with the free agent keen on a return to the Premier League.

The 36-year-old can openly talk with clubs since he was released by Zenit St Petersburg this summer after three years with the Russian club.

The Serbia international wants a return to the English top flight and a move to link back up with former boss Carlo Ancelotti at Everton was rumoured, but Sportsmail revealed the Toffees were not interested in the move.

Ivanovic has maintained a high level of fitness, playing regularly in Russia, and is now in talks about a potential move to Premier League new boys West Brom, according to Championat via Sportwitness.

The defender featured 35 times for the Russian champions last season in all competitions, scoring four goals.

The report suggests there is no indication on what stage talks are at the Baggies, though the Midland outfit are unlikely to offer Ivanovic, who turns 37 in February, a deal any more than one season.

He would bring Premier League experience to West Brom after a successful 10 seasons with Chelsea in which he was an integral player for several different managers.
