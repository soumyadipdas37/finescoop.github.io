They rekindled their romance earlier in the summer following an acrimonious break-up in 2019.

And TOWIE's Yazmin Oukhellou and James Lock looked stronger than ever as they packed on the PDA during their holiday in Crete on Sunday.

The brunette beauty, 26, oozed confidence as she slipped into a tiny Christian Dior swimsuit while a doting James, 33, snapped her Instagram photos.

The star showed off her bronzed legs and peachy posterior in the blue and white swimsuit as she posed.

Her brunette locks were styled in a sleek, high ponytail while she accessorised with futuristic shades.

James displayed his own hunky frame in a pair of grey swimming trunks.

The on-again couple couldn't keep their hands off one another as they spent the day together at the beach, exchanging several kisses as Yazmin sat on James's lap. 

Passion: The couple, 26 and 33, shared several steamy kisses during the course of the afternoon

Yay: Yazmin shimmied in a Christian Dior swimsuit as a doting James captured some racy snaps of her by the sea

This comes after she and James confirmed they had rekindled their relationship while shooting scenes for the new series of TOWIE in South Woodford, east London.

A week earlier, they were seen putting on a cosy display during filming for their show, hugging and giggling as they attended a food festival in Chelmsford, Essex.

Days before that, Yazmin and James did little to dispel rumours they had rekindled their relationship as they enjoyed dinner together at Sexy Fish in London's Mayfair. 

PDA: The couple looked smitten as they embraced and kissed during the day

Toned: The star showed off her bronzed legs and peachy posterior in the blue and white swimsuit 

Pose: James displayed his own hunky frame in a pair of grey swimming trunks

Close: The pair held hands as they strolled by the beach during their trip

Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted in June, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.

'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'

Look of love: The pair stared into one another's eyes as they walked down the beach
