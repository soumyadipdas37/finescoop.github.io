Manchester United have set their sights on Ajax defender Nicolas Tagliafico as a possible alternative to Alex Telles.

The Red Devils want to add a new left-back and offer competition to Luke Shaw. 

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer missed out on Sergio Reguilon after Tottenham agreed to a buy-back clause with Real Madrid.

Manchester United switched their attention to Brazilian Telles, 27, who is into the final year of his contract at Porto.

But the Sun claim the club are also considering Argentine full-back Tagliafico, who is available for around £23m.

The 28-year-old was on Leicester’s shortlist as a replacement for Ben Chilwell, but they oped to sign Atalanta’s Timothy Castagne instead.

Negotiations between United and Porto are said to be ongoing over defender Alex Telles
