They have been busy filming TOWIE's 10th anniversary series. 

And Amber Turner and Dan Edgar looked in the throes of love as they filmed scenes at a pig farm in Essex on Wednesday.

The reality star, 27, put on a busty display in a ribbed vest top which she teamed with high-waisted flared jeans and trainers.

Amber shrugged a white leather jacket over her shoulders and added a touch of designer to her look with a Louis Vuitton cross-body bag.

She styled her blonde locks in soft waves and amped up the glamour with a full face of make-up. 

Dan, 30, meanwhile looked dapper in a beige linen jacket, matching trousers and a white T-shirt.

Farm life: Amber looked very unimpressed as she stared at a pig

The couple packed on the PDA as they strolled hand-in-hand around the pig farm before later joining Liam 'Gatsby' Blackwell and James 'Diags' Bennewith, 29. 

Gatsby was a little overdressed to feed the pigs in his pink suit, while Diags cut a much more casual figure in a black jacket and jeans. 

Amber watched from the sidelines as the boys played with their furry friends. 

The couple firmly got back to reality after a sun-drenched getaway in Crete.  

All in the details: Amber complemented her chic outfit with a gold chain necklace

Last month, ITV released a trailer ahead of its special reunion episodes that air in September. 

The hit ITVBe show posted a video to Twitter full of key moments from the show's history including when Lauren Goodger pushed ex Mark Wright into a swimming pool.

Other hilarious parts include Sam Faiers asking for a vajazzle and Gemma Collins telling people to 'Google her'. 

Run! The boys tormented Amber as they fooled around in the pig pen

Well hello there: Amber seemed taken with an alpaca as she took her phone out to video the animal

Having a blast: Diags appeared to be thoroughly enjoying the trip to the farm 

Amber and Dan have been stronger than ever after spending lockdown together.

The couple rekindled their on-off relationship in May last year after a brief split which saw the Lothario pursue a relationship with his co-star Chloe Sims, 37.

The blonde beauty previously talked about how Dan has become a 'changed man' since they gave their romance another go.

Amber told The Sun: 'Sometimes you have to go through really low points in life, and Dan admits what happened was a real low for him. He lost me. I was gone and he wasn't in the best place.

'When you lose someone it makes you realise how much you want them and need them in your life, he's not someone in their mid-20s anymore, he's mature and serious about life.

'Obviously joking around, but he has had his mid-life crisis already. Now he's such a changed person. He's so happy and focused on his future. I'm excited for the future with him.'

Say cheese: The couple beamed as they posed for a photo ahead of filming
