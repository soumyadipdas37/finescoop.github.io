The new season of The Block recently premiered on Channel Nine. 

And stunning photos show how the current cast transformed a vacant block in Melbourne's Brighton between January to August this year.

The area now has a handful of modern homes in a monochrome colour style.

Incredible: Recent photos show how the cast of The Block transformed a vacant lot in Melbourne's Brighton into a cluster of homes 

The houses also come with pools in the backyard and the front has cute brick fences.

Season sixteen of the hit reno reality series premiered to a respectable 943,000 viewers.

Applications are officially open for the 2021 season of The Block.

Before: Photos taken back in January show an almost empty lot with some unfinished structures

Colourful: In January, some of the unfinished buildings had coloured tarps over them

Building: In a more recent photo, the houses are much closer to completion 

Two episodes into the show's 2020 series, Channel Nine are already on the hunt for its next batch of blockheads.

Reality TV star hopefuls can now apply for the renovation program's 17th season, as a casting call out officially went live on Monday.

The casting announcement on CastaSugar states: 'We are looking for enthusiastic, motivated, hardworking teams of two to participate in Australia's biggest renovating challenge.' 

Looking down: A bird's eye view shows the roofs of the houses 

Looking good: The houses have a similar colour scheme of grey and white 

Cool for the summer: Some of the homes appear to have pools in the backyard

Lovely: The manicured lawns in the front of the homes look inviting 

Before fans think about applying, they must ensure they are within the age bracket of 18-65 and are 'energetic and with a sense of humour.' 

The site also claims that 'previous home renovation experience is an asset, but not required from both partners'. 

When it comes to the logistics of taking part on the show, Nine states that contestants must put their real lives on hold to focus on the show.

'Successful couples must be available for a 10-12 week shoot period from late February, 2021,' the post reads, adding that participants 'will NOT be able to work' during this time.

White houses: One of the homes has a cream colour paint job

Watch your step! This home has steps leading up to the front door

Brick by brick: Another home has a brick arch approximately one meter from the front door

However, it appears contestants will be paid for their time filming the hit show if successfully chosen for the series.

'Successful participants will be paid a nominal weekly fee during filming of The Block to cover basic living costs and expenses,' Nine states.

To be chosen as one of the five teams, the application form insists: 'Long term couples, family teams and enduring friendships need only apply.'

The exact dates of filming and the location of The Block 2021 has yet to be confirmed.

Settling down? The house build by the reality TV cast look perfect for settling down in

Comfortable: Another home has an inviting feel and seems comfortable 

If fans fancy their chances at impressing judges Darren Palmer, Shaynna Blaze and Neale Whitaker while making some serious cash, they will have until midnight on the September 27 to apply.

The Block's first three seasons took place in Sydney, before it moved to Melbourne for the following 13 seasons.

And according to judges, the hit reno show won't be returning to Sydney anytime soon.

The trio explained to Domain that the capital of Victoria is the perfect place to film the show because of its 'arts culture'.

Nice for a stroll? The houses have a tidy footpath out the front and a manicured strip of grass

Secure: The brick fences and gates give off a strong feeling of security 

Interesting choice: One of the brick fences used two different coloured bricks

According to Shaynna, 57, not only does the city have easier access to a wider variety of homeware stores due to less traffic, but it is the perfect place to film because of the city's energy.

'We are an arts culture here, and architecture and design really comes into that,' she said.

Even NSW-based Neale, 58, agrees with Shaynna, stating it's the 'best city.'

He added: 'Melburnians love The Block, and I think they love having The Block in their city.'

Nice: Another image shows a small covered veranda area with a lounge and table

'I'm watching you!' This photo of a fence and gate shows many 'no entry' signs

Darren, 42, also said that that building heritage-fronted homes with modern additions is generally easier to do in Melbourne, because of councils 'progressive approach' to planing.

'The Block is really about finding something old and then adding something new – it's really perfectly situated in Melbourne because Melbourne does it best.'

Of course, this year's season of The Block has been unlike any other due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cars: This photo of an alley besides the homes shows some parked cars and garbage bins

Modern: From this angle, the modern garages are visible 

Production was brought to a grounding halt in March, with the cast and crew returning to the show's new $15million site in Melbourne's Brighton in May.

And speaking to Realestate.com on Monday ahead of Sunday's premiere, host Scott Cam revealed that he was unsure about what may happen to production of the 2021 season amid Victoria's second lockdown.

When asked whether there's been 'any word yet' on filming for 2021, the 57-year-old said: 'It's too early to tell - I have no idea about next year and what the story is.

'I don't even know about this year's auction. It's in November, and we still aren't sure! Hopefully, in three months time things are different, but you never know.'

It's a hit! Season sixteen of the hit reno reality series premiered to a respectable 943,000 viewers
