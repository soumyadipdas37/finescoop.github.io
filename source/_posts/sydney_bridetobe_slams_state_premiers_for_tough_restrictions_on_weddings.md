A bride-to-be who was forced to postpone her wedding due to COVID-19 has blasted state governments over the tough restrictions placed on couples getting married.

Annalisa Mastrofilippo, 24, was due to marry her fiance Domenic Dileo in August this year but will now tie the knot next April.

The 24-year-old from Sydney said because of her culture and religious beliefs, she needed to wed her fiance before they could live, travel or start a family together.

Ms Mastrofilippo has since started a petition to 'open up weddings', adding the restrictions were discriminatory to people of various backgrounds.

'Brides and grooms of Australia can't take this blatant prejudice towards the wedding industry any longer,' she wrote in the petition.

'Open our weddings Gladys Berejiklian and Brad Hazzard and other state premiers.

'It's time all of Australia band together and give couples the day they have planned and deserve.'

Current restrictions on weddings in NSW mean guests are capped at 150 and everyone must adhere to the four square metre rule.

The bride and groom are also the only guests allowed to dance.

Ms Mastrofilippo said postponing her wedding had not only weighed on her finances but had also become an emotional burden.

Ms Mastrofilippo has since started a petition to have restrictions placed on weddings in NSW lifted (pictured, with her husband-to-be)

'In our culture and with my religious values, there are so many things that can't happen until we're married, we can't move in together to the home we have purchased, we can't go on holidays and we can't start a family which is most important to us,' she told news.com.au. 

'We can't invite all of our close family members let alone friends, my fiance and I are very fortunate that we come from large Italian families with multiple generations. How do I tell one relative they can come and another relative they can't come?' 

The bride-to-be said she couldn't understand why people were allowed to gather at sports events or shopping centres but not weddings.

The petition which was started last week has garnered more than 5,000 signatures.

Ms Mastrofilippo is hopeful by the time her wedding rolls around, the 'inconsiderate' COVID-19 restrictions will be eased.
