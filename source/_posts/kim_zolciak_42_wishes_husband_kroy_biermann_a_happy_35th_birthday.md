Kim continued: 'Boy did I rob the cradle with you and I'm so glad I did! You amaze me daily somehow, someway... everyday,' adding a prayer emoji.

'Although it is annoying that you know everything literally. You are the most INCREDIBLE DADDY on this planet, an incredible husband and I love every minute we spend together.'
