Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood is set to star in the Celebrity MasterChef's Christmas special, according to reports. 

The TV star, 55, already reached the final once in 2007 on the second ever series of the BBC show, but is rumoured to be returning for the festive one-off.

Craig will be joined by former Made in Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, 32, who also previously starred on the show, reports The Sun.

Also rumoured to be signing up are 2015 I'm A Celebrity winner and Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattinson, 32, as well as Loose Women's Janet Street-Porter, 73. 

A TV insider told the publication: 'Producers didn't just want to create a generic Christmas version of the show, so they decided to make it an 'all-stars' affair too. 

'And the celebrities they've chosen to come back certainly made an impression with their personalities and cooking the first time round.

Star-studded: Craig will be joined by former Made in Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, 32, who also previously starred on the show, reports The Sun 

'For the past two years the Christmas specials for MasterChef professionals have proved a hit, so this was a logical next step.' 

Craig used to work as a chef when he first started out in showbusiness and also appeared on an episode of Ready Steady Cook. 

He was then one of the finalists on the second-ever series of Masterchef 13 years ago and also had his own cookery slot on ITV's Lorraine.

Tv stars: Janet Street-Porter, 73, is also reported to have signed up for the special after previously putting on her apron in 2013 alongside Les Dennis

Craig's competitors have also starred on the show in the past with Janet putting on her apron in 2013 alongside Les Dennis and Vicky Pattison making the final in 2019.  

Spencer made it to the final of the 2018 series, eventually being beaten by singer and ex-EastEnders actor John Partridge.

Craig is currently gearing up for his judging role on the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing. 

Earlier this month he risked the ire of BBC bosses after saying he thinks Strictly contestant Nicola Adams will be 'punching above her weight' while Bill Bailey will be a 'terrible' dancer.

The brutally honest judge didn't hold back when he was asked his thoughts on some of this year's contestants who are yet to take to the dancefloor.

Speaking on Mecca Bingo online, Craig said: 'I think Nicola Adams will be punching above her weight, darling.' 

The phrase is often used for someone who has a more attractive partner, however Craig added: 'But I am looking forward to seeing a same-sex couple. That's going to be cool.'

The TV star was also asked what he thought of Bill Bailey's chances on the series and said: 'Terrible. I'm looking forward to the disasters!'

Craig does have more faith in The Wanted's Max George, who is a trained dancer, saying: 'Oh yeah, he's going to be great.'

An insider told The Sun that Craig's jibe at Nicola was not 'misogynistic', but referred to the fact she has said she is not the best dancer.
