Oleksandr Usyk and Derek Chisora will at last get to face each other after their rescheduled heavyweight fight was confirmed for October 31.

Ukranian star Usyk was originally set to enter the ring against Chisora on May 23, but the fight was delayed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Now after a hiatus of more than five months, they will collide at the end of October, with a venue to be confirmed soon.

Usyk has become the undisputed cruiserweight king, but is now targeting all the world heavyweight belts to keep himself on course for a WBO mandatory title fight with Anthony Joshua.

But the 33-year-old must first turn his attentions to defeating Chisora, who overpowered Artur Szpilka at The O2 in July last year, 12 months after his stunning eighth-round knockout of Carlos Takam at the same location.

'I have really missed boxing,' said Usyk following the news.

'I am working hard in my training camp to show a spectacular performance on October 31. I expect a real test in Derek - he is strong, tough and resilient. He is a really big guy and he hits hard.

'As a cruiserweight, I reached the highest heights as undisputed champion and now I am following the same path as a heavyweight. I need to test myself against world class heavyweights on my new road to undisputed and Derek stands in front of me.

Now after a hiatus of more than five months, Usyk will fight Chisora at an unconfirmed venue

Usyk is seeking to keep his dream of a mandatory WBO fight against Anthony Joshua alive

'Many people say that Derek is a monster, but deep down he is a kind man. I don't expect to see that good side of him. I know that he wants to break me, but I am water, wind and fire all together. Derek Chisora, I am coming for you!'

Chisora himself added: 'Helllllo, Usyk, I'm ready for you, helllllo Usyk!

'Usyk, I've been ready for you all year. It's my home turf and after such a tough year for everyone, I'm going to give the British public the Halloween party they deserve and finally get revenge for my boy Tony Bellew!'

But he must firstly turn his attentions to defeat Chisora who beat Artur Szpilka last year

'To bounce back with this fight at this time is so important for boxing,' said promoter Eddie Hearn. 

'You've either got to sit back and say 'it's not possible' or find a way to make it happen, and I've got to say a big thanks to Team Usyk, 'Del Boy' and David Haye for staying patient and helping get this over the line.

'It's an absolute firecracker and a fight that's so important to the heavyweight division over the next few months. 

'We saw a stunning victory from Povetkin recently to shake up the mandatory situation, can WAR Chisora spring the upset and KO the undefeated undisputed world champion? I know he will do everything he can to try and get the victory and this will be another night of heavyweight drama!'

Promoter Eddie Hearn said the fight was important for the sport in the current climate
