Barcelona have confirmed the sale of Arturo Vidal to Inter Milan but the club will receive just £917,000 for the midfielder.

Inter were keen to sign the Chile international in January after Vidal became embroiled in a contract dispute with Barcelona.

The Catalans accused Vidal of trying to force through a move to Inter by opening a lawsuit against the club for alleged unpaid bonuses.

Vidal has now got his wish after the two clubs came to an agreement, which both clubs confirmed on Tuesday.  

A statement on Barca's website read: 'Barcelona and Inter Milan have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Arturo Vidal. The Italian club will pay FC Barcelona 1 million euros in variables.

'FC Barcelona would like to publicly express their gratitude to Arturo Vidal for his commitment and dedication and wishes him all the best for the future.'

Vidal joins Chile team-mate Alexis Sanchez at Inter and becomes sixth Chilean to play for club

Vidal scored 11 goals in 96 appearances his two seasons at the club, which saw him win La Liga in 2018/19.

That success saw him win an eight consecutive league title in three different countries, while he also added the Spanish Super Cup to his collection.

Vidal also scored the final goal in a 5-1 thrashing of Real Madrid at the Nou Camp and will now hope to add to his glittering trophy cabinet at San Siro. 

In joining the club, he becomes the sixth Chilean to play for Inter, following Ivan Zamorano, David Pizarro, Gary Medel, Luis Jimenez and Alexis Sanchez.
