Inter Milan 'will try and sign Chris Smalling from Manchester United' if they sell Milan Skriniar to Tottenham Hotspur.

Jose Mourinho has identified the Slovakia international as a defensive target before the transfer window closes on October 5 but Spurs want to drive down Inter's £46million asking price.

But if Skriniar was to leave for London, Inter have reportedly identified Smalling as his replacement.

Inter Milan 'could move for Chris Smalling', the Manchester United defender who spent last season on loan at Roma, if Milan Skriniar is signed by Tottenham before the deadline

Inter's Slovakian defender Skriniar, valued at £46m, has been linked with a Tottenham move

It appears Smalling has no future at Old Trafford after spending last season on loan in Serie A with Roma.

Roma haven't yet agreed a permanent deal with the Englishman and, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter could pounce.

Smalling, 30, is valued at £18m by United but could become the fourth player to swap Old Trafford for the San Siro in recent months after Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Ashley Young.

As Sportsmail reported this week, Smalling is growing frustrated at United after being left in limbo as talks continue.

Smalling has been training twice a week at Man United's training ground as he waits to move

Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho would like to sign Skriniar to reinforce their defence 

The defender is training on his own twice a day at United's Carrington training ground to keep up his match fitness after returning from his Roma loan.

Smalling is unhappy that negotiations over a permanent move to Roma haven't progressed faster and has been in regular contact with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

The former England centre-back believes United should be doing more to give him the move he wants after spending a decade on the books at Old Trafford since a £10m transfer from Fulham in 2010.

However, United are refusing to budge on their valuation at a time when they need to generate as much money as possible to finance new signings.
