Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto has insisted his team are not in a crisis despite an embarrassing performance at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Drivers Sebastian Vettel and Charles LeClerc struggled for pace all weekend and finished way outside the points in 13th and 14th place on pure speed. 

Such was the failure of the works Ferrari team in Belgium, that they were also defeated by their engine customer Alfa Romeo in the hands of ex-Ferrari man Kimi Raikkonen.

Ferrari had a miserable Belgium Grand Prix finishing in 13th and 14th as they struggled for pace

Team-principal Mattia Binotto said the team is not 'in crisis' despite the worst race since 2009

The last time Ferrari finished as far down the field on pace alone was at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 where Raikkonen finished 12th and Giancarlo Fisichella standing in for Felipe Massa finished 16th.

Their current drivers have been frustrated so far this season, but under-fire team-principal Binotto says the team's current slump is only temporary as he looks to turn around their fortunes.

Speaking after the Belgian Grand Prix he said: 'I think it is wrong to use the word crisis for the moment we are going through.

'Certainly this is a very bad result within a difficult season that we are experiencing.

'But we knew it was coming, we saw it in winter testing, and then came the impossibility to develop the car.

'We all take responsibility for this situation. I take that as team principal as well as all those who work in Maranello.

It is disappointing for Charles LeClerc and Sebastian Vettel who both won races last season 

'We are all in the same boat. But although the team is in the middle of the storm, we are very united.'

Their result at the Spa-Francorchamps shows just how much they have fallen in one year.

Last year LeClerc took his first Formula One victory at the same track before going on to win the Italian Grand Prix in front of the Tifosi and then in Singapore.

However, a subsequent FIA investigation into their engine led to Ferrari reaching an undisclosed settlement before this season began.

Since then, Ferrari have been well off the pace and, at the Belgian Grand Prix, they were the only team setting slower lap times than 12 months ago

Ferrari weren't even the quickest Ferrari-powered car of the weekend, that was Alfa Romeo

Ferrari have taken two podiums through LeClerc who has outperformed the car this season

The SF1000 has particularly lacked engine grunt and straight-line speed and so far they currently sit in fifth in the constructors standings. 

Next up for Ferrari is Monza and they will hope to perform much better at their home track, but they are expected to struggle due to the track's long straights.

Binotto said:  It's a tough period and we're looking into what we want to do. As for Monza, it'll be tough in a week's time because it's such a fast track.

'Changing engine modes in qualifying will be banned, so we'll see which changes we can make.

'There's no point kidding ourselves. We have to rally as well as we can for when our car offers more.'
