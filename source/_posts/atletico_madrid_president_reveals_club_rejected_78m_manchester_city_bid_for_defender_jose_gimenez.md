Atletico Madrid have turned down a £78million bid from Manchester City for defender Jose Gimenez, the Spanish club's president Enrique Cerezo has revealed.

The Premier League club have been unable to suitably replace Vincent Kompany after he rejoined Anderlecht in 2019, with manager Pep Guardiola searching for a new recruit to partner Aymeric Laporte in the heart of defence.

City have already moved to strengthen their defensive options by signing Nathan Ake from from Bournemouth in a £41m deal, and Cerezo claims they have also tried to add Gimenez to their ranks. 





'We did receive the offer,' Cerezo told El Transistor. 'But Gimenez is a magnificent player and we are interested in having magnificent players in the team.' 

Gimenez has made 191 appearances for Atletico since signing arriving from Uruguayan club Danubio in July 2013, but has been ruled out of action for at least two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus.

The 25-year-old has established himself in Diego Simeone's first team, winning the La Liga title, Spanish Super Cup, Europa League and UEFA Super Cup during his seven years at Wanda Metropolitano. 

South American football expert Tim Vickery believes a deal for Gimenez would represent 'very good' but 'costly' business for Manchester City.



'Gimenez is one of the best young centre-backs around. He is a baby-faced assassin. Only 25, and he looks younger, but he has already played two World Cups and he is as hard as nails and he can play as well,' Vickery told Sky Sports.

'He has perhaps never operated in a team that is as attack-minded as Man City. Both with Atletico Madrid and Uruguay he is with more reactive teams so this would be a challenge for him but there aren't many better young centre-backs around in the world.

'I think it would be a costly piece of business for Man City, but a very good one.'

Atletico Madrid confirmed that they have agreed a deal to sign Luis Suarez for £5.5million

Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid have reached an agreement to sign Luis Suarez from Barcelona for a £5.5m fee. 

Atletico confirmed via their official website that Suarez, 33, will join them subject to him passing a medical and his contract being formalised. 

During his time at Barcelona Suarez scored 198 goals in 283 appearances.
