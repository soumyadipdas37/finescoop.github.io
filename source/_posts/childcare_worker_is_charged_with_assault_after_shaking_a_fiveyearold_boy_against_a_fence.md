A childcare worker who allegedly 'forcibly' shook a five-year-old boy after he threw toys over a fence told his boss he was only defending himself, a court has heard. 

Kyong Shik Choi, 46, appeared before the ACT Magistrates Court on Tuesday after allegedly assaulting the child at the Blinky Bill Early Learning Centre in Canberra’s south last week.

The court heard Choi, who has since been fired, pushed the boy down, grabbed him by the collar and shook him against a fence, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Documents tendered to the court allege the boy hit the father-of-one in the face with a nearby mat. 

In an interview with police the alleged victim said he was 'sad' and 'angry'.

The incident was witnessed by a member of the public who called out for Mr Choi to stop before reporting him to the supervisor, the court heard. 

The court was told Choi told his boss he agreed his behaviour was inappropriate but he was defending himself after the boy had kicked and spat at him, ABC News reported.

Mr Choi, originally from South Korea, was charged with common assault and released on bail to reappear before the ACT Magistrates Court later this month. 

The ACT Magistrates Court heard Choi saw the boy throwing plastic blocks over a fence before pushing him down, grabbing him by the collar and repeatedly shaking him against the fence
