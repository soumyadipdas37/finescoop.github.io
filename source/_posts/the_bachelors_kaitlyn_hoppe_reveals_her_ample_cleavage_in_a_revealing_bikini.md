She was labelled 'Gold Coast trash' and Malibu Barbie' last month on The Bachelor during a fiery clash with fellow bachelorette, Roxi Kenny.

But a defiant Kaitlyn Hoppe proved she doesn't care what anyone thinks as she stepped out in Burleigh Heads over the weekend.

The blonde bombshell showed off her ample cleavage in a VERY revealing cut-out bikini as she as she enjoyed an ice cream and purchased some champagne at a nearby bottle shop alongside a her male pal.

Malibu Barbie! The Bachelor's Kaitlyn Hoppe revealed her ample cleavage in a revealing bikini as she stocked up on ice cream and champagne in Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast on the weekend 

Last month, a heated argument between Kaitlyn and Roxi Kenny stunned viewers of The Bachelor.

A jealous Roxi, 29, became furious after discovering love rival Kaitlyn, 26, had given leading man Locky Gilbert a kiss at the cocktail party.

At one stage, she said within earshot of Kaitlyn: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.'

Flashing the flesh: Kaitlyn teamed her bikini top with a pair of tiny white shorts 

'That's classless. She's Gold Coast trash,' she added. 'This little silly b***h over here is saying she pecked on with someone. It's disgusting. The b***h is a sl*t.'

As things became heated later on, Roxi labelled Kaitlyn 'Malibu Barbie gone wrong', before screaming over and over again that she was 'trash'.

Meanwhile, Kaitlyn repeatedly held her hand up in front of Roxi's face and told her to 'go cry', which only aggravated her further.

And viewers had plenty to say about the dramatic confrontation, with many fans picking sides on Twitter.

'Both Roxi and Kaitlyn were out of line tonight but I'm team Malibu Barbie, what a crack up,' tweeted one amused viewer.

Mmmm kind of on Roxi's side, Kaitlyn is being horrendous,' added another, while one person wrote, 'Yeahhh I think I'm gonna join Team Kaitlyn just because she's not Roxi'.

Added one sarcastic fan: 'I'm with Roxi... what was Kaitlyn thinking kissing the guy whose romantic attention she is trying to secure...'

Meanwhile, one disgruntled viewer claimed the only losers in this situation were the show's fans, who were subjected to it.

'Turns out the real loser of this argument between Roxi and Kaitlyn is us, the viewers,' they tweeted.

The dramatic showdown prompted Roxi to storm off, before bursting into tears in a private area.

'You are trash. Trash. Put a f**king hand in my face again, I swear to God! Not here. Not here. You're trash! You are trash. Trash!' she shouted as she stormed off.
