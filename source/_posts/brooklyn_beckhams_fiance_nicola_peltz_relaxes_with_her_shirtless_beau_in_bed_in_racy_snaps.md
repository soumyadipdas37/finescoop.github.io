They've been putting on a loved-up display since announcing their engagement in July.

And Brooklyn Beckham's fiancée Nicola Peltz has given their fans another glimpse at the happy couple's time in lockdown with a series of raunchy new snaps. 

Nicola, 25, looked sensational as she relaxed on a bed with her shirtless beau in one of the black-and-white images, letting her blonde locks cascade over her shoulder.

The beauty donned a halterneck top for the image and rested against silk pillows while Brooklyn, 21, laid across the bed.

While in another picture Nicola flaunted her svelte figure as she showed off her taut midriff in a black thong and delicate chain piece of jewellery.  

Nicola also showed that she's been making the most of the downtime and soaking up the chance to relax with a picture of her wearing a white shirt and sitting in bed.

She accompanied the gallery of images, which also included a snap of her brother Bradley playing tennis, with the caption: 'some love in lockdown.'

It comes after Brooklyn recently referred to Nicola as 'my wife' in a sweet Instagram post last month, appearing to confirm speculation they have already married in secret.  

The photographer set tongues wagging when he showed off a gold band on his wedding finger, with his followers asking if the pair had already married in secret.

Appearing to confirm the union, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, commented 'my wife' on a smitten snap of the pair - which Nicola had captioned 'My forever'.

Wedding speculation started last month when Nicola shared a cryptic snap of a gold ring on Brooklyn's finger. 

The image shared to Nicola's Instagram Stories showed the couple clutching a label, with Brooklyn sporting a gold band on his left hand.   

Brooklyn's mother Victoria then uploaded a snap of her son alongside his younger brother Cruz, 15, with a gold ring visible on his wedding finger.

'I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day. I love you baby xx.'
