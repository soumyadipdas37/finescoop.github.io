Backlash: London's fashion forward pregnancy photo comes after she copped backlash after revealing that she's going to be charging fans on the subscription service

London's fashion forward pregnancy photo comes after she copped backlash after revealing that she's going to be charging fans $14.99 per month on the subscription service, OnlyFans.

One fan said that while she's happy for influencer Reece, 25, and London, they just can't comprehend coughing up the cash for the images.

'Congratulations. I would love to keep track of everything for your pregnancy. Just like with your relationship to watch you guys grow together... But I don't want to pay for an OnlyFans...'

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia last week, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans.

'I have chosen to show detailed parts of my pregnancy on that platform because I've had to experience harassment and bullying for the last two years over my relationship with Reece,' she explained.

More secure: London said she made the decision to post on OnlyFans because over the years she and Reece have been 'harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action'  

'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on.

'I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not. If people don't like the idea of it or disagree with my decision then they don't have to be involved...

'We're just doing this to ensure a HAPPY POSITIVE FRUITFUL PREGNANCY.'

London and Reece revealed they were expecting a child earlier this month, just weeks after announcing their engagement.
