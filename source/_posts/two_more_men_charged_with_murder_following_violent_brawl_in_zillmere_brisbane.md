Girum Mekonnen (pictured), 19, died on Sunday following a vicious gang fight

Two more men have been charged with murder after a gang fight involving African youths armed with bats and blades left one man dead. 

Girum Gebayaw Mekonnen, 19, died after a violent fight between two groups of about 20 Africans broke out at O'Callaghan Park in Zillmere, Brisbane at 5.35pm on Sunday.  

Two men, aged 19 and 26, were charged over the alleged murder of Mekonnen on Thursday and will face court on Friday.

Ten other gang members, already appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday charged with almost 150 offences for their alleged involvement in the murder and fight, The Courier Mail reported.   

Kresto Wal Wal, 24, Yohana Wal Wal, 19, Gabreal Wal Wal, 27, Santo Wal, 32, Majok Riel Majok, 18, Juma Makuol Deng Makuol, 23, and Chan Kuchmol Kon, 24, all from Redbank Plains, and Anas Ayman Abdu Musa, 21, of Bray Park, Alex Edward Deng, 18, of Collingwood Park and Goodna man Joseph Lokolong, 24, were all mentioned in court.

Charges for the 10, aged between 18 and 32, include murder, grievous bodily harm, affray and disobedience to lawful order.

Lawyer Nicholas Crawford is representing the four Wal brothers who are accused of Mekonnen's murder after they were allegedly identified using CCTV and mobile phone tower data.

'But there is no direct evidence or witnesses identifying who is supposed to have done what,' he said. 

'They're not a part of a gang and they have no criminal convictions,' he said.

Mr Crawford said he will fight the charges and apply for bail for his four clients. 

Defence lawyer Andrew Owens is representing Anas Ayman Abdu Musa, who claims his client wasn't even at the park.

'He's doing well, it's obviously pretty overwhelming to be charged with murder in such a serious matter but he's keeping his head up.'

Mr Owens will also fight the charges for Musa and apply for bail.

Detective Superintendent Tony Fleming on Wednesday said it will be alleged those involved went to Zillmere with the intent to assault the victims.

'This was an event that was highly confrontational and has been traumatic for the victims of the crime and their families,' he said.

'It's just unacceptable to have people in a public space who are going about their business then attacked this way.'

Paramedics took 11 people to hospital with stab wounds and blunt force injuries after one group attacked another with knives and baseball bats.

Some of the victims were knifed in their torso, pelvis, head and face.

Three people remain in hospital with one in a serious condition.

'It's a horrific, unacceptable attack in our society,' Det Supt Fleming said.

'But retribution is not going to solve the problem.'

The 10 men were remanded in custody to return to court on November 16 for mention.
