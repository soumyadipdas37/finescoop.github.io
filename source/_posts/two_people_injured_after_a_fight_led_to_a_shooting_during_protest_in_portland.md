Two people were injured after a fight led to a shooting during renewed unrest in Portland on Tuesday after demonstrations were halted due to wildfires.  

Portland police said in a statement that officers were responded to the 4400 block of Northeast Glisan Street around 10.30pm. 

The incident occurred during a demonstration of about 75 people who gathered at Laurelhurst Park and marched to the Penumbra Kelly Building on East Burnside Street. Demonstrations resumed on Monday after a brief hiatus due to wildfire smoke.

Witnesses told police that there had been an altercation between two people, which then led to one of the individuals firing a gun at the other. 

Authorities said the person was struck by the gunfire and paramedics took both people to a local hospital. 

Both subjects sustained serious but non-life threatening injuries. A nearby business was also hit with gunfire, police said in the statement. Police are still investigating what led up to the fight. 

The two individuals, who have not been named, were a part of the demonstration outside of the Penumbra Kelly Building. 

Police warned protesters Tuesday night not to enter or remain upon the property or walkways and that failure to adhere would result in either an arrest or citation. 

Shortly after the warning, a 'commercial grade firework' was thrown towards the property by someone in the group, police said.

The firework landed near several police cars parked in the lot.

At around 12.18am demonstrators entered onto the property of the Penumbra Kelly Building and were arrested.

Police identified three people who were arrested during the demonstration Tuesday night. 

Laura Sutton, 33, Tracy Lynn Molina, 47, and Simona Arteaga, 39, were all arrested, police said. They were charged with interfering with a peace officer.

By 1am the group mostly dispersed into the neighborhood.

Police are asking if anyone has any information regarding the shooting to contact investigators at 503-823-3333.
