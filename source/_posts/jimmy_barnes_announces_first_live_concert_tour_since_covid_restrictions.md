Jimmy Barnes is going back out on the road for the first time since COVID-19 restrictions came into play. 

The rocker will hold the Top End Breakout Tour in Darwin on September 26, where he will be joined by a number of other acts for a live, eight-hour mini festival. 

The 64-year-old has been quarantined in the Southern Highlands in order to cross into the Northern Territory ahead of the gig.

Border closures and quarantine requirements mean he will not be able to have his whole band on board, but has enlisted other artists to join him. 

Held at the The Darwin Ski Club, the show will be for all ages, and measures to keep the crowd COVID safe will be enforced. 



Jimmy told The Daily Telegraph on Saturday: 'We are starting up in Darwin but we want to be playing everywhere'. He added that he took on the gig because he wants 'people to know things are on the mend'

The Cold Chisel singer added that it 'breaks his heart' that he can't currently play in Victoria due to the state's strict lockdown. 

'The fact those people have been supporting me for that long and always turned out, always been great audiences and you can't go and play for them, it breaks my heart, you know,' he said.
