The Bachelor's Nicole Campbell was sent home on Wednesday night after she failed to get a rose from Locky Gilbert. 

The professional dancer, who got the triple threat rose in the premiere of the season, fought back tears as she was told the news via Zoom.   

'Not getting the chance to go back to the mansion and see Locky in person, it's heartbreaking,' she told host Osher Günsberg and the remaining girls.

Despite being clearly heartbroken, Nicole offered a dignified farewell. 

'I wish I could hug you all,' an emotional Nicole said, after the other ladies said they wanted to farewell her in person. 

'But that's OK. But, Locky, I just hope you find happiness. I hope you find what you're looking for,' she added, before signing off. 

It wasn't long before social media was flooded with kind words for the vivacious beauty.

Chin up: Despite being clearly heartbroken, Nicole offered a dignified farewell. 'I wish I could hug you all,' an emotional Nicole said to the other ladies 

'I feel beyond sad that you were sent home. You were the most beautiful girl in the mansion and my absolute favourite,' one fan wrote.

While a second viewer decided to put their foot down, writing, 'So you're out which means it was the final episode for me... We really need more people like you on TV.' 

 'Wrong move. I really feel for you. I thought you were the one,' added a third viewer. 





Reaction: It wasn't long before social media was flooded with kind words for the vivacious beauty 

Earlier in the episode, drama ensued when blonde bombshell intruder, Bec Cvilikas, arrived on the scene. 

The 24-year-old's inclusion at the virtual cocktail party even managed to start a fight between Juliette Herrera and Roxi Kenny. 

'Do you feel like you want to backtrack on saying that [Bec's] connection with Locky is just purely physical?' Juliette asked Roxi, in front of newcomer Bec.

Just breathe: 'Do you feel like you want to backtrack on saying that [Bec's] connection with Locky is just purely physical?' Juliette (pictured) asked Roxi, in front of newcomer Bec

'What?! Typical Juliette. Here we go. Every time, without fail. As soon as I heard my name, I was, like, "Here we frickin' go again,"' Roxi lashed out.   

Roxi then accused Juliette of throwing her under the bus, amid Bec's arrival.   

'Don't pull that card with me, mate, 'cause that is a load of sh*t! Go stir up sh*t with someone else, Juliette, 'cause I don't want a bar of it tonight,' Roxi said. 

Calming mantra: 'Don't pull that card with me, mate, 'cause that is a load of sh*t! Go stir up sh*t with someone else, Juliette, 'cause I don't want a bar of it tonight,' Roxi said. Pictured

 

'Once again, I'm simply pointing out some truths and Roxi's losing her flippin' mind,' Juliette said. 'I just speak the truth. It's all on camera!' 

The two women are set to go head-to-head when they return to the mansion.
