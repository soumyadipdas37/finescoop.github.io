Ashley Roberts looked a vision in blue as she made a stylish exit from work at Heart FM in London's Global Studios on Thursday. 

The radio presenter, 38, donned a chic blue silk shirt and jogging bottoms in a darker hue as she made her way home after hosting her breakfast show. 

Her outing came days after she returned home from a sun-soaked break in Turkey.

Ashley oozed confidence as she strutted down the street in her eye-catching ensemble by Serena Bute London. 

She finished her look with a pair of white Gucci trainers, while she carried her essentials in a blue Kurt Geiger handbag. 

The Pussycat Doll left her blonde tresses loose for the occasion, while she enhanced her features with a minimal make-up palette. 

The previous day, Ashley reunited with her pal and co-host Amanda Holden, 49.

Ashley posed for a slew of photos with Amanda after reuniting following their summer breaks. 

She captioned the post: 'Girls are back in town'. 

It comes after Ashley took to Instagram on Sunday evening to share a scenic bikini-clad snap by the sea in Turkey. 

The Don't Cha hitmaker looked phenomenal as she drank in her surroundings while donning a barely-there red two-piece.

She added a caption on the duo of snaps reading: 'She holy hunni. How beautiful?! Here’s to looking and hoping for a brighter rest of 2020 #wecanhope #adventure #motherearth #grateful'.

Ashley revealed last month she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption. 

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29. 

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. 

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.' 

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'
