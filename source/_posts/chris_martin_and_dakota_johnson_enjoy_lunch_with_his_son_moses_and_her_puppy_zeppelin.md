Like many celebrities catching the last rays of summer, Chris Martin and girlfriend Dakota Johnson have escaped the Hamptons.

Chris, 43, and Dakota, 30, were spotted with his son Moses, 14, and their puppy Zeppelin, as they enjoyed lunch out together in Amagansett, in the town of East Hampton, on the South Shore of Long Island.

The group appeared to be grabbing food to go as the Fifty Shades of Grey star carried a brown paper bag, as well as an iced coffee, on Sunday.

Dakota showed off her tanned and toned legs while stepping out, as she dressed in a simple over-sized white shirt, and a pair of sneakers.

Meanwhile, Amagansett is the place where Chris owned a home with his first with Gwyneth, 47, before they split 2014 split, and they famously announced they were 'consciously uncoupling.'

As well as Chris moving on with Dakota, Gwyneth is now married to TV producer Brad Falchuk, 49.

However, just last month, Gwyneth once again spoke about Chris and their marriage in a new essay for British Vogue.

Gwyneth, who shares daughter Apple, 16, and Moses with Chris, said: 'We didn't quite fit together. But man, did we love our children.' 

'Between the day that I knew and the day we finally relented to the truth, we tried everything,' she wrote.

'We did not want to fail. We didn't want to let anyone down. We desperately didn’t want to hurt our children. We didn’t want to lose our family.'

She also wrote about the difficulty she faced in telling their two children the news of the split.

'I bent myself into every imaginable shape to avoid answering the. But one day, despite all our efforts, I found that I was not at a fork in the road. I was well down a path.' 

'Almost without realizing it, we had diverged. We’d never find ourselves together in that way again,' she added. 

In 2018, Gwyneth married new husband Brad in a lavhish Hamptons wedding, that was not attended by Chris. 

The star-studded affair included Robert Downey Jr giving a speech, director Steven Spielberg attending with his own video camera, and Rob Lowe showing off his moves on the dancefloor, according to reports at the time.
