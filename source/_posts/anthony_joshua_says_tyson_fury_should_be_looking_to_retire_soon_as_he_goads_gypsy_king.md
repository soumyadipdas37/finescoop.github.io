Anthony Joshua has taken a swipe at heavyweight rival Tyson Fury by claiming he 'should be looking to retire soon'.

The pair are hoping to clash in a highly-anticipated mega-fight next year that would see the winner crowed as undisputed champion, with both fighters holding all five world title belts between them.

And Joshua says he is 'here and ready' to share a ring with Fury, claiming it might be time for him to call it a day after turning professional 12 years ago. 

Anthony Joshua has taken aim at Tyson Fury, saying his rival should be looking to retire soon

Joshua is hoping to face the Gypsy King in an all-British undisputed title fight next year 

Joshua told Sky Sports: ''Fury has been professional much longer than me. He should be looking to retire soon.

'If he wants to cement his legacy, I'm here and ready. I've built myself into this position.'

The IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion has enjoyed a fairytale rise to the top of boxing having savoured wins over Dillian Whyte, Wladimir Klitschko Joseph Parker and Alexander Povetkin.

And while the British star is eager to prove his worth by fighting WBC champion Fury and Deontay Wilder, he insists his record proves that he has faced stronger opponents. 

The Watford-born star claims he is 'here and ready' for a mega bout with Fury in 2021

The pair drummed up excitement about a contest after meeting in Marbella this summer

'I'll challenge Fury, I'll challenge Wilder,' he said. 'These guys aren't the biggest names that I've fought on my record anyway. They are just another heavyweight.

'Look at my record. They are not the best fighters that I have challenged. When they are ready, I'm here to fight.'

Joshua had a whirlwind year in 2019 as he suffered a shock stoppage loss to Andy Ruiz Jr last summer before winning his titles back in the rematch in Saudi Arabia. 

He won gold at the 2012 Olympics in London before quickly turning professional the following year - becoming a world champion three years later. Joshua said he was on 'a different journey to Fury' but had no fear of facing him. 

Joshua believes he has fought stronger opponents than Fury and insists he does not fear him 

'I came up quick,' he added. 'That shows I'm ready. These boys turned professional in 2008 and it took [Fury seven years] to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. He's on a completely different journey. I want to steam through.

'I haven't got fear of Fury - whether he's got a better chin than me, a better jab than me, whether he's all of this stuff that people say. So be it. Let me go in there and prove myself. Show you who I am and what I can do.

'I've fought five champions and been in two unification fights. I'm a two-time heavyweight champion in the space of 24 fights and a [seven-year] career. It shows you I am serious.

The four-belt world champion must first see off the challenge of Kubrat Pulev later this year 

'If Fury is serious, I'll take that fight seriously too.'

Both Joshua and Fury have obstacles to get past if they are to set up a clash next year. The Watford-born star has a mandatory fight against Kubrat Pulev, which still does not have a designated venue after their April bout at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was postponed. 

Fury, meanwhile, must see off Deontay Wilder in their trilogy fight, slated for later this year in the US.
