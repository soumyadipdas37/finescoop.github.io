Miley Cyrus is speaking out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday. 

The Midnight Sky singer made the claim during her chat with Joe Rogan on his Joe Rogan Experience podcast, detailing the incident. 

Miley, 27, began explaining how she'd requested for the lights to be turned off during her performance - including a 'beauty light' used specifically for female performers - which ruffled some feathers with a director. 

Technical difficulties: Miley Cyrus claims MTV director made a sexist comment about her raunchy VMAs performance... after she asked to be 'treated like a guy'

'I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s****,' she said, saying: 'I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light.'

'The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f******g lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn't turn the beauty light off.'

The pop star continued: 'They said, "Okay, we'll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys," because that's what I want.'

Beauty: Miley - who shared these stunning snaps on Thursday - made the comments while appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast

Candid: Miley showed off this snap of her doing her mother's male-up on Thursday

'And then something that I was doing... for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s***t and they said, '"you want to be treated like a guy? We wouldn't be dealing with this if a guy was doing it."' 

'And I said, "Well a guy wouldn't be doing this because a guy doesn't sell your show with sex the way that I'm going to,"' she divulged. 'And I'm aware of that. It's a ridiculous conversation and also embarrassing.'

Miley's performance saw her stride across a giant disco ball on stage as she held onto a chain in a skimpy pair of pants. 

'Treat me like a guy': Miley revealed how an MTV director allegedly made a sexist comment, suggested her performance would be less complicated if she were a male performer

The star continued: 'The VMAs is a pop culture show celebrating pop culture, and I wanted to bring that especially in this time of COVID-19 [with] all these at-home performances... I want to give my fans escapism, good old pop culture. This is surrealism.'

It's the latest in a few bombshell revelations that have popped up from the podcast.

 Miley also spoke about her marriage to Liam Hemsworth, and about how tough she found the experience.

'What really sucked about it wasn't the fact that me and someone that I loved realized that we don't love each other the way that we used to anymore, that's OK, I can accept that,' she said.

'I can't accept the villainizing, and just all those stories. It's amazing that the public kind of thinks there's no gap of time they didn't see that could possibly be what led to this.'
