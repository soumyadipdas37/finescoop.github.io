With filming finally back under way in Berlin, after shutting down for several months due to COVID-19, Neil Patrick Harris revealed new details about The Matrix 4.

Filming started back up again in Berlin last month, five months after filming was shut down in San Francisco as COVID-19 started to spread more rapidly.

Harris, who was cast in an unspecified role back in October, told The Jess Cagle show that the overall style of the sequel has 'shifted' from the original trilogy.

When asked if fans will be 'blown away' by the sequel, Harris said, 'I have great hope that, that fans will appreciate all the work that Lana and everyone is putting into this movie.'

'I'm a big Lana Wachowski fan. I think she's a great person. I think she has a great inclusive energy and her style has, has shifted, um, visually from what she had done to what, um, she is currently doing,' Harris added.

Wachowski is directing the movie solo, without her sibling and co-writer/co-director on the original Matrix trilogy, Lily Wachowski, though Harris hinted her style changed, 'in an evolved way,' adding 'she's such a bright light.

'I would have been happy to be in any capacity in this. I would have been happy to just go and visit the set of a big giant franchise movie,' Harris added.

'So the fact that I get a small part in this, and can watch from a far in, in, you know, and the majority of it, and see how it's working and see sort of the machine of it all, machine probably being appropriate since it's the Matrix, I just, I've just been having a blast,' he added.

Harris also praised the filmmaking team as 'very smart,' since they're, 'making a giant movie and under very unique conditions.

'I've always wanted to be a lead in a big giant action movie with wires and stuff and I've, and this is not that for me, but it's certainly tangential and fun for me to be able to admire it and at least play in the sandbox a little bit,' he added.

The actor also said he 'can't wait' until the day that theaters can safely open again (approximately 60 to 70% of the nation's theaters are open, though major markets like New York and Los Angeles are still closed).

He added that The Matrix 4, 'deserves to be seen on a big scale,' adding, 'It's ambitious and, everyone involved in, as far as I'm aware is crushing it.'
