A former abortion clinic employee says that there are 'tons of women' who 'claim to be anti-abortion' but come in to end their own pregnancies — and do a 'neat mental trick' to justify it.

Twitter user @AnnoyedCicada detailed her own experiences in an unspecified abortion clinic, recounting several stories of vocally anti-abortion patients who were nonetheless at the clinic for their own abortions.

She said that in addition to considering their own abortions justified and others' unjustified, many of the women were hostile, telling the doctors they were going to hell or should be in jail while ranting against the other patients.

Hypocrisy: A former abortion clinic employee says that there are 'tons of women' who 'claim to be anti-abortion' but come in to end their own pregnancies

Rude: She said that in addition to considering their own abortions justified and others' unjustified, many of the women were hostile

'Anyone who has ever worked in an abortion clinic knows that tons of women who claim to be anti-abortion get abortions. They do a neat mental trick where *their* abortion is justified,' she said.

'At the clinic I worked at, we used to put a pink sticky note on their charts to give a heads-up to the back office staff. That way you'd be prepped for the hostility.'

She faced that hostility herself.

'I had a woman tell me I would burn in hell as I held her hand during her abortion,' she recalled.

'Another woman refused to wait in the same waiting room as the other patients because she didn't think she was "irresponsible" the way they were. We obliged to protect our other patients from her hostility. 

Rules for thee, not for me! The women would tell the doctors they were going to hell or should be in jail while ranting against the other patients

'Yet another woman laughed and told the doctor performing her procedure that she thought he should go to jail. After he had performed the abortion, of course,' she went on.

Another woman 'became furious when we told her we needed consent to perform the abortion'. 

'She threw magazines from our waiting room at our staff after we told her we wouldn't do it without her signing consent forms. She tried to schedule with us several times. We kept referring her out. 

'My years working in the clinic made me realize that a lot of "pro-life" people are willing to make exceptions for themselves or their loved ones. They just lack the empathy to understand that everyone seeking abortions has the same need that they do.'

There is also evidence of this brand of hypocracy among some anti-abortion politicians. 

Republican Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania was outspoken in his anti-abortion stance, and co-sponsored a 20-week abortion ban bill.

But in 2017, he resigned when a woman named Shannon Edwards, whom Murphy admitted to having an affair with, said he pressured her to get an abortion.

'You have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,' she allegedly texted him, according to documents obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Meanwhile, Republican Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee recorded himself pressuring his mistress into getting an abortion in 2000. The tape surfaced in 2012.
