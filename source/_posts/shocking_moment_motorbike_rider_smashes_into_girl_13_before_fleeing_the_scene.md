A brazen motorbike rider has been captured on dashcam smashing into a teenage girl before riding off. 

The rider collided with the 13-year-old as she waited to cross the road outside of a school on the New South Wales mid-north coast on Wednesday.  

She was knocked to the ground at Nicholson Street, in South Kempsey, about 3.30pm before the motorcyclist got up and drove away.   

A brazen motorbike rider violently collided with a 13-year-old girl (collision pictured) as she waited to cross a road on the New South Wales mid-north coast on Wednesday

The rider immediately fled the scene (pictured) and left the girl with minor injuries 

'Police have been told the teenager was hit when the rider, who was travelling on the footpath attempted to enter the roadway,' a NSW Police statement said.

'After falling from the motorcycle, the rider fled the scene.' 

The teenager suffered from minor injuries including a laceration to one of her arms as a result. 

Officers from the Mid North Coast Police District attended the scene and commenced an investigation. 

NSW Police have released shocking CCTV video of the incident and appealed to members of the public for information about the crash. 

The confronting footage showed the rider veer off the footpath and on to the street, smashing into the back of the 13-year-old as she waited to cross. 

Both people were knocked to the ground and the motorcyclist was thrown from the bike in front of shocked witnesses.

The rider immediately stood up and left without checking on the teenager.     

It is understood the motorcyclist was wearing a dark hooded jacket, dark coloured pants and black joggers. 

The rider was also wearing a blue and white helmet. 

The motorcycle has been described as possibly being a Honda KTM bike.   

Anyone with information about the rider’s identity has been urged to contact police.
