She revealed earlier this year that she was finally 'at ease' with her body after years of 'ups and downs'.

And Natalie Cassidy cut a low-key figure on Monday as she displayed her slim figure in Essex during a shopping trip. 

The EastEnders star, 37, took cautious measures amid the coronavirus pandemic and wore a face mask for her outing.

Natalie displayed her toned figure in a pair of black linen wide-leg trousers and a matching long-sleeved top.

Finishing her low-key look, the soap star opted for a pair of Converse trainers and a black rucksack.  

Natalie styled her glossy brunette locks into a high ponytail fastened with a denim scrunchie and appeared to go makeup-free.

She appeared in good spirits during her shopping trip as she visited stores Hobbycraft and H&M.

Earlier this year, Natalie was forced to pause filming on EastEnders amid the COVID-19 pandemic but the soap has now resumed production.

The soap star made the most of lockdown with her family Eliza, nine, who she shares with ex Adam Cottrell, and Joanie, three, who she shares with her partner, EastEnders cameraman Marc Humphreys. 

Earlier this year, Natalie revealed that she is finally 'at ease' with her body after years of 'ups and downs'.

The actress, who joined the cast as Sonia Fowler aged just nine, was bullied about her weight and was even called a 'beached whale' before reaching her teens.

And while her weight has fluctuated between a size six and 16, she is now body confident at a size ten.

'I feel very at ease with myself now, as I've got older. Throughout the years I've gone through a lot of ups and downs,' she told the Express Saturday magazine.

'Now, I just know the simple things that work – eat well, exercise, drink lots of water. All the boring things but I feel like my body is the size it should be now.'
