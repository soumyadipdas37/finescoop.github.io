Little Mix star Jesy Nelson's new boyfriend Sean Sagar is reportedly on the celebrity dating app Raya.

According to The Sun, the Our Girl actor, 30, has an account on the dating service and his profile picture is a smouldering black and white shirtless snap.

A picture obtained by the news website shows Sean's profile, which lists his profession as acting and his location as London.

It is unclear whether Sean's dating app profile is an old one from before he started dating the singer.  

Raya is a private members-only app where users must be invited and have to link their account to their Instagram page.

Although the service was originally just for dating, features now promote professional networking for those in the entertainment industry.

It comes just a day after Jesy's new beau urged her to 'come home' as she posted a sizzling snap onto Instagram on Wednesday, after suffering a panic attack during her recent Radio One Live Lounge performance.

New couple Jesy and Sean finally confirmed their relationship last month during a beach date in Brighton after weeks of claiming they were 'just friends'.

Earlier this week, the documentary filmmaker received an outpouring of love and support from fans following her emotional BBC show. 

The songstress was joined by bandmates Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall at the London studios, but had to leave the stage after breaking down in tears.

Following their incredible live rendition of new single, Holiday, Jesy began to tear up and held up her hands to show that she was visibly shaking. 

Although the girls had been trying to adhere to social distancing, Jade broke the rules in order to comfort Jesy. 

The band then left the stage together before a member of production was seen heading to talk to the star.

The cameras livestreaming the performance were immediately cut off, but started up again later when Jesy returned to the stage and bravely finished the gig.  

Explaining the incident to her concerned fans, Jesy later took to Instagram to share a video from rehearsals as she revealed: 'So I had panic attack right before we were about to sing this for live lounge today and like a pro @perrieedwards jumped in for my part last minute and smashed it this is what we originally did in rehearsals'.

Jesy - who has spoken candidly about her struggles with anxiety and depression - was immediately comforted by fans, who took to Twitter to express their love for her. 

Fans penned: 'proud of jesy for quickly pulling herself together and proceeding to sing her heart out, it isnt easy to just snap out of it on the spot when anxiety takes over. i hope she knows she has our endless love and support.'

'WAIT WHY DID JESY CRY?? MY HEART'; 'SO GOOD. they came and did what they had to do. so much love to you jesy. [sic]' 

'“Jesy” is trending in Brazil because she started crying after ‘Holiday’ performance at BBC Radio 1. We really hope she is okay. We love you Jesy so much'; 'JESY WAS CRYING AT THE END OF THE SONG WHATS GOING ON LITTLE MIX LIVE LOUNGE';

'they were so nervous, you could tell i‘m not gonna lie right, i got a bit worried after the holiday performance because it was a bit shaky and you could tell that they knew that. holiday lives off the production. and then jesy... but gosh they really pulled it ouf the bag.'

'jesy sweetheart... let’s send her a lot of love, she deserves it so much for the precious woman she is'; 'the girls went straight over to comfort jesy, that’s what best friends are for! jesy girl you got this we love you [sic]'. 

Late last year, Jesy revealed that horrific trolling - which clouded her perception of success - left her in a 'deep depression' and even caused her to attempt suicide.

Late last year, Jesy revealed that horrific trolling - which clouded her perception of success - left her in a 'deep depression' and even caused her to attempt suicide.

She spoke candidly about her mental health struggles in BBC documentary, Odd One Out, which broke a viewing record for BBC Three and won a National Television Award. 

Six months on from the documentary, Jesy gave an interview with MailOnline in March, as she admitted is 'still working on herself' but is now 'mentally stronger'.
