Myleene Klass has revealed she designed her own engagement ring after Simon Motson proposed. 

The singer, 42, was left astounded when her partner of five years popped the question last month with a promise ring on the fifth anniversary of their first date.

After the initial shock wore off, the couple got to work designing a unique band for the star, eventually settling on a black diamond ring that is the only one of its kind.

It's a Klassy jewel: Myleene Klass has revealed she designed her own engagement ring after Simon Motson proposed last month  

For the project, Myleene enlisted the help of Ira Kormind, the director of 77 Diamonds and a personal friend of hers.

Together, they came up with a head-turning 7.63 carat emerald-cut natural black diamond centre stone and a dazzling split band set with 114 delicate white diamonds, meaning the whole ring comes in at around 9-carats in total. 

Wow: Myleene settled on a black diamond ring that is the only one of its kind

Speaking to HELLO! magazine about the design, Myleene gushed: 'This diamond is the only one of its kind in the world. 

'Ira was sending us photos and we were sitting around the kitchen table, drawing pictures and sending her bits of paper. It was about making something we both loved.' 

Ira told MailOnline the stone is 'irreplaceable', explaining, 'The centre stone is the only one of its kind in the world and was sourced and secured by the 77 Diamonds team.

'It was a joy for me to work with my friend Myleene on this ring. 

'Working with any couple to realise their dream ring is always an exciting and emotional experience for us at 77 Diamonds and it's what we do daily, but when it's your friend, it's all that and then some.'

Speaking to Hello! magazine, Myleene told how Simon, 45, got down on one knee in their garden shed which he made into a replica of where they had their first date and surprised her with a nine-carat diamond ring. 

She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.

'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: "Oh my God, he's for real." I was completely speechless.'

Simon added: 'It's quite a blur but I think I said something along the lines of: 'Myleene Angela Klass, will you marry me?' And I had to say it again... and I think I said it a third time. Finally she said yes and we were both in tears.'

The PR man spared no expense for the proposal, even borrowing the table and chairs they used at Little House private members' club in Mayfair. 

Ever the romantic, Myleene told how Simon also decorated the shed walls with framed photos and filled their garden with fairy lights. 

The couple's engagement has delighted Myleene's daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, who have been determined to see the couple walk down the aisle while Simon's children, a 13-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, are also thrilled. 

Myleene and Simon began dating in 2015 after she split from husband Graham Quinn in 2012, and they welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year. 

Late last month, the former Hear'Say singer had taken to Instagram to share snaps of her romantic date night with Simon but did not reveal he had proposed.

In a trio of posts Myleene shared a video of the idyllic set-up for their anniversary date in their back garden with the soundtrack of Elvis Presley's Can't Help Falling in Love (With You).

Myleene also shared several snaps to her Stories accompanied by Your Song by Elton John, including one from a recent holiday as they sped across the ocean in a boat.

Another showed the couple on a bike ride together, while one image showed them cuddling together in a hammock.

Across the posts, she wrote: '5 years to the day that we met... Happy Anniversary... Can't wait to do the next 5 and the 5 after that and, and, and... I love you Always and forever... Your Leenie x.'

Although the star previously ruled out getting married again after what happened with her first husband, she recently said she would be open to having another baby and tying the knot with businessman Simon. 

Myleene said in an interview with Hello! magazine: 'I would not say no to another baby. I don't want to tempt fate. Who knows what life has got planned for you? 

'We didn't know we would even get him [Apollo]. The kids would love it if we had another baby. Simon is raring to go.' 

Family: Myleene and Simon welcomed their son Apollo in August of last year 

Myleene also joked that her daughters have been 'on Simon's case' to propose and said they've already got a wedding 'all planned out' for the couple.

She added: 'My girls are definitely on Sim's case about it [marriage]. I suppose it's just children's way of solidifying what's around them. The kids just want a party.

'Sim doesn't get a say in it either. It's genuinely down to the children. They've got their own conflab going on between them and have planned it all out. 

'They have even decided the baby will be the ring bearer! There are no weddings this year. But 2021? They would love that!' 

Overjoyed: The couple's engagement has delighted Myleene's daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, who have been determined to see the couple walk down the aisle  

Myleene and ex Graham, who she shares her daughters with, split up after he walked out on her on her birthday, just six months after they got married.

The divorce proved an expensive one for the singer who did not sign a prenup despite her friends and even her priest advising her to. 

Speaking previously to the Daily Mail, she said: 'That was as stupid as it gets. One of my girlfriends said later, "You married a former drug dealer who wouldn’t sign a prenup. What were you thinking?"' 

The mother-of-three found the split to be a devastating experience, saying: 'It rocked my whole existence. My parents have been married for 37 years.

At the time, the experience left Myleene, who was with Graham for 12 years, vowing that she would never get married again to save herself going through a similar experience.

She said: 'I'm talking about when a guy can take it off you. I’ll never let that happen again, so help me God. 

'If I'd decided to gamble with my money, I could take that, but someone taking it... no. F***! I’m never getting married again. Never.'

Myleene recently admitted she feared she would be a single mum to her girls forever before she met Simon.

Speaking to Sophie Ellis-Bextor on her podcast, Spinning Plates, she said: 'I thought I was going to be a single mum forever. The first shock of being a single mum was horrible.

'It's not a blueprint I recognised, when I got into the role of a single mum, I had the fear of, "How am I ever not going to be a single mum?" I really like how this flows. I really love me and my girls, it feels like it's us against the world.

'I love that we go everywhere together, I love that they're my three amigos, it's a really lovely feeling.'
