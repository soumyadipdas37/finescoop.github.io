Mike Tyson is leaving nothing to chance ahead of his return to the ring as he enlisted the help of WWE icon Kurt Angle and former UFC champion Henry Cejudo for a weekend training session. 

Tyson is preparing for an eight-round fight on November 28 against Roy Jones Jr and at the age of 54 is keen to ensure his preparation is as challenging as possible. 

The battle-hardened trio came together over the weekend as Tyson, who has been training since March for the bout, continued to put in the work for his exhibition contest.

Former professional wrestler Angle shared a photo of all three of them together in the gym on his Instagram page. 

Angle wrote in the caption: '#SmartCups Ambassadors @henry_cejudo @miketyson and yours' truly, at a training session today.'

Tyson, famously known as the Baddest Man on the Planet in his heyday after becoming the youngest ever heavyweight to win a world title in 1987, has been working with MMA trainer Rafael Cordeiro for the fight. 

Cordeiro is a respected trainer and has got Tyson in impeccable shape with footage emerging over the weekend of the 54-year-old in action.

A pad-work session shows Tyson unleashing a barrage of punches onto his trainer and it is an ominous sign for Jones Jr ahead of their November date. 

Tyson is seen marshalling the ring before using the session to work on his head movement and his combination punches with an opponent on the ropes.  

The pay-per-view fight was originally slated for September at the Dignity Health Sports Park in California.

It was pushed back by two months but is expected to be at the same venue. It has been reported judges will not score the fight. 

Earlier this month executive director for the California State Athletic Commission, Andy Foster, looked to play down fans' expectations for the fight, with many having been left stunned at the shape of Tyson and the power he still possesses. 

'They're going to spar hard, but they shouldn't be going for a knockout. This isn't a record-book type of fight,' he said, as per the Sun. 'This is not world championship boxing right now. It's not what this is. People shouldn't be getting knocked out. The public can see what kind of shape Roy and Mike are still in.'

But Jones Jr has since insisted that Tyson will be hard to control once he steps through the ropes. 

'It's a sparring session, but you have to remember, I'm the small guy here,' Jones Jr told Yahoo Sports.

'Andy Foster can't control Mike once Mike gets in the ring. I've got to defend myself like I'm in a real fight. If Mike goes out there and decides to start hammering, what am I supposed to do, look at Andy?

'Hell no! I've got to defend myself and get back in it. I have heard what Andy Foster said, but I also know what Mike said and I can't depend upon Andy Foster when I am in the ring with Mike. You hear me? I have to get myself ready for whatever Mike may bring. I have to be ready for war.'
