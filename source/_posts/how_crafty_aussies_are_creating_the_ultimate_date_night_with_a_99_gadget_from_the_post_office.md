Creative Australian couples have started curating their own at-home cinema experiences with a $99 gadget you can purchase from most post offices.

With very few new movies screening at cinemas across the country because of COVID-19, families have turned to projecting their old favourites on walls in the home for a theatre-style experience.

'Thank you to whoever posted about the $99 iBright Screen Projectors from the post office,' one woman wrote on Facebook.

She combined that with a $55 Chromecast - a digital streaming device - and a $25 floating shelf from Bunnings - to balance the projector on - to show off her latest Netflix watch, all from the comfort of her bed. 

'The sound and picture quality is amazing, I would definitely recommend doing this,' she said. 

Others who were searching for a new TV abandoned looking altogether after they purchased the projector.  

'Our TV has been fading and getting white spots so we have been looking for a cheap new one,' said one lady online.

The projector weighs just 4.5 kilos and can project as wide as five metres onto a flat surface

'All of them have been out of our price range so we ended up buying a projector from the post office. Then we went to Spotlight and bought a blockout roller blind to use as the screen.'

She showed a picture of her contraption, which is approximately two metres wide, and can easily be moved outside for 'BBQ movies'.

Some people have purchased them to have in their caravan on holidays, while others keep it near their cabana and outdoor pool to watch outside in the summer months

'This is such a cool projection. I'll have to look into this,' said one person in reply to the projector owners.

'Thank you I just jumped on and bought one! Can't wait to try it,' said another.

A third added: 'I'm sold. Forget the new TV this is what I need'.
