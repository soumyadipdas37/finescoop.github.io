Kim Kardashian was spotted on Thursday at an office building, one day after her husband Kanye West was suspended for 24 hours by Twitter for posting the phone number of a Forbes editor.

The star's rapper husband included the private phone number of the editor in his bizarre Twitter rant on Thursday, as well as including footage of himself urinating on his Grammy Award.

Kim, 39, who has not yet commented on Kanye's latest rant, was seen wearing her face mask incorrectly as she got into her SUV, which was parked in an underground garage at an office building in Los Angeles.

The mother of four had her face mask below her nose, despite the fact that the correct way to wear it is over both the nose and mouth. 

Hours later, Kim shared on her stories Thursday that she was at sister Khloe Kardashian's house and was tempted by the cookies in her kitchen.

'These are my weakness guys. How much willpower do I have? I'm on a 40th birthday countdown so I have to just be... I'm trying to be less sugar and just less carbs.' Kim turns 40 on October 21.

Meanwhile, Kanye's 24 hour suspension was seemingly over, as the artist and designer tweeted out twice Thursday morning, one of which said, in all capital letters: 'We've never seen anything like this before... look how all the artist stood up praise God my brothers its time for freedom keep praying [sic].'

The second tweet appeared to be a vintage promotional item from 2003, that was autographed by Kanye from Roc-A-Fella Records; he captioned it 'Diamonds Up.'

Twitter revealed Wednesday that Kanye violated its rules by tweeting the phone number of the magazine editor, according to NBC News.

Publishing personal information as in a number or address is a form of online harassment called doxxing, which is against the social media sites rules, the outlet noted.

It is unknown if he deleted the tweet at the request of Twitter or if Twitter deleted it, as it was no longer available on his account to view one hour after he initially posted it. 

According to Twitter's rules: 'The first time you violate this policy, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can Tweet again. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your account will be permanently suspended,' via the outlet. 

Kim is 'continuing to support' her husband, US Weekly reported. 'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help.'

The latest: Meanwhile, Kanye's 24 hour suspension was seemingly over, as the artist and designer tweeted out twice this morning

The Keeping With The Kardashians star knows and is aware that her husband struggles with his mental health, so she wants him to know she is doing her best to empathize. 

'She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.' 

West took aim at music labels Universal and Sony last Wednesday, September 16.

West stated that he was '[going] into battle' against the labels in an attempt to try and retrieve the rights to his own music.

Along with his brave declaration, Kanye shared shocking footage of himself urinating on one of his 21 Grammys, which was placed inside of a toilet bowl.

'Trust me... I WON'T STOP,' West captioned the clip, which referred to his current bid to gain ownership of his masters - otherwise known as the copyright to his original songs.

'If any of my fans want to call a white supremacist... this is the editor of Forbes,' West wrote above the phone number of the publication's editor.

West has repeatedly hit out at the magazine in the past for failing to label him as a 'billionaire'. 

West's current battle with his labels began on Monday, when he attacked the structure of the music industry, declaring that musicians actually had little to no power because record labels owned all of their work.

He took aim at his labels Universal and Sony and vowed not to release any new music until he was freed from his contracts with them.   

In a stinging tweet on Tuesday, West also savaged the strict contracts that black NBA players were under, and stated: 'The music industry and the NBA are modern day slave ships. I'm the new Moses'.

Taking to Twitter again on Wednesday morning, the rapper repeated the same sentiment, claiming: 'There is no NBA or music industry without black people... fair contracts matter... ownership matters.'

West also shared the screenshots of a private contract he signed with Universal back in 2011, just minutes after he tweeted: 'I feel so humbled and blessed that God has put me in a strong enough position to do this ... Everyone keep praying.. It's working... I am on my knees this morning.'

He then appeared to address black artists directly, and claimed that there needed to be an overhaul in the business.











Not holding back: West's current battle with his labels began on Monday, when he attacked the structure of the music industry, declaring that musicians actually had little to no power because record labels owned all of their work

'We've gotten comfortable with not having what we deserve ... they [record labels] allow us to have a little money from touring, get some gold chains, some alcohol, some girls and fake numbers that feed our egos ... but we don't own our masters,' he wrote. 

He also riffed on the Black Lives Matter movement, by tweeting: 'BLACK MASTERS MATTER'. 

During his Wednesday Twitter rant, West also stated that he was too powerful to be 'muted or cancelled' and declared that he was rich enough to buy his masters from Universal and Sony.

'Universal won't tell me what my masters cost because they know I can afford to buy them,' he taunted in a tweet shared shortly after 6am PDT.

West has a reported net worth of $1.3 billion. The cost of his masters is likely to be upwards of $300 million.

Interestingly enough, his desire to buy his masters but not getting the chance to was the same issue his former acquaintance Taylor Swift had in 2018; Scooter Braun bought Big Machine Label Group, acquiring almost all of Taylor Swift's masters in the process.

She has long maintained that she was never asked if she wanted to buy her own masters prior to the same. 

West went on to share a number of Biblical verses, before writing: 'I KNOW MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST WILL MAKE FOOLS OF AND PUNISH ALL WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN UNFAIR CONTRACTS'.

He added: 'I will do everything in my legal power and use my voice until all artist contracts are changed, starting with getting my masters for my children. I will not stop, I promise you. I am petty and very personal.'

He further claimed that the bid to own his masters was to ensure the future financial security of the four children he shares with Kardashian.

Referencing his daughter, North, he stated: 'She will be able to do nothing but put up emojis for the rest of her life because my children will own my masters.'

On Monday, West hit out at the fact most artists do not own their masters.

'In the streaming world master ownership is everything... that is the bulk of the income ... in COVID artist need our masters,' he wrote.

'Artists are starving without tours ... Ima go get our masters ... for all artists ... pray for me.'

Later in the day, he reportedly tried to contact Universal and Sony about being released from his contracts.

 

On Monday night, West declared himself to be the 'new Moses' and proclaimed the music industry to be 'modern day slave ships'

The following day he shared a text conversation on Twitter about possibly taking legal action against Universal and Sony after failing to hear from them.

In the actual text conversation, the individual who could be a lawyer writes: 'Meaning that we can argue that Universal and Sony have not supported you fully. And that as a result they have breached. This is the lawsuit/termination nuclear option.'

The individual continues: 'If we went that route we would litigate and ask for your masters as part of a settlement. This is a high risk but high reward strategy.'

At some point, West and the individual spoke about Taylor Swift and the controversial $300 million deal that Scooter Braun, who manages Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, struck in order to obtain her master recordings in 2019.

'Re masters ownership we can look into buying. But if Taylor's [Swift] cost $300million yours would cost a lot more I assume. Remember that if you re-recorded these songs you could own these new masters outright,' the person speaking with West wrote.

'A much more radical consideration would be to propose an entirely new relationship or joint venture with Universal. One that is equal and not one sided. I am not sure you are interested in that. But if [sic] could be a Yeezy Media/Universal joint venture play but one where you have the power,' the person continued.

In response to those text messages, West responded: 'I'm not open to any form of business with Universal or Sony.'

In his most recent Twitter rant, which occurred just last Wednesday, Kanye joked that his wife would represent him in legal proceedings, referencing to Kim's four-year law apprenticeship under the supervision of attorneys Erin Haney and Jessica Jackson. 

The incident comes following his failed bid for President - a move which prompted many experts to say he was in the midst of a bipolar episode.

He has spent almost $5.9 million - most of which is his own money - on his presidential bid through August, according to filing obtained by NBC News.

West first acknowledged his bipolar disorder in 2018, a condition that is associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs and can be controlled with medication.

Kardashian hinted last month that his struggle with bipolar was to blame for his recent erratic behavior, that has seen him embark on the unlikely bid for presidency and get emotional at his first campaign rally in South Carolina while discussing abortion. 

Two months ago, the Runaway hitmaker ruthlessly lambasted Kim and her famous family on Twitter.

During the aggressive tirade, Kanye alleged that Kim was trying to 'bring a doctor to lock [him] up' and compared her mother Kris Jenner to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

He even admitted to his followers that he had been trying to divorce Kim for two years.

Kanye later apologized to his online audience and to Kim for the out of line tweets and he has since left talk of his marriage off social media.

 Kim and Kanye, who wed in 2014, share four children together, daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, five, and Psalm, one.
