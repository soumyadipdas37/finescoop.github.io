Saffron, who regularly features alongside Bobby on the ITVBe reality show, spoke about the importance of 'true friends' in lockdown.  

She said: 'I really realised who my true friends were in that time. People that you could just pick up the phone to and I realised that I'd wasted a lot of energy and time on things that I shouldn't have. 

'Because at the end of the day, you've got to be happy with yourself.'

In April Saffron and Bobby headed to local hospitals in Essex to hand out goods to frontline workers in collaboration with online retailer ISAWITFIRST. 

The pair also started 'a virtual hub' on Instagram named Isolation With The Nation in April where they shared daily live videos to connect people during lockdown.

Speaking about her mental health, Saffron said: 'I'm an empath. I'm a giver, so I'm always thinking about somebody else. 

'When it come to me, I was like, s*** this is real. And I've suffered in the past with my mental health. 

'I've suffered with anxiety and not as much depression but I think I was going down that route so I've gone through that.'

She continued: 'I've been to therapists and things like that and you talk about yourself so much, but still I don't think I ever was sitting with myself. There's a massive difference.'

And Saffron admitted she has 'grown' from lockdown despite feeling 'negative' at the time. 

The TV star also revealed that she has 'found her feet' on TOWIE through 'solid friendships' and described how it is her 'best series yet'. 

Saffron, who was with someone from 15 for ten years before entering a new relationship, revealed how viewers may see a different side to her now she is 'newly single' .   

'The viewers have not really known much about me until now so I've been able to sort of run with that and share a bit about my personal life,'  she said.  

'I've just been sort of finding happiness alone because lockdown really highlighted a lot for me. 

'I got the time to self-reflect, a lot of time to sit with my own thoughts which I haven't done for a long time, and just being on my own, which sounds mad but it was daunting. I didn't know what alone was.' 

MailOnline has contacted Gemma's representatives for comment.
