Sebastian Vettel has been confirmed as a Racing Point driver for the 2021 season - just hours after Sergio Perez revealed he was leaving the team. 

The four-time world champion suffered a poor season with Ferrari last year, with the manufacturer releasing the 33-year-old earlier this summer. 

He had been in talks with Racing Point, who will compete as Aston Martin in 2021, for several weeks after becoming a free agent and is now set to team up with Lance Stroll, the son of Lawrence Stroll - a co-owner of the team.

The German became surplus to requirements at Ferrari after a poor campaign last year

It follows an annoucement from Mexican Perez that he would be leaving Racing Point after playing a key role in helping the team, previously known as Force India, from going out of business in 2018.

Perez said: 'Everything in life always has a beginning and an end, and after seven years together, my time with the team will come to an end after this season.

'It hurts a bit as I bet on the team during very rough times. We managed to overcome obstacles and I am very proud of saving the jobs of several of my team-mates.' 

Perez revealed his departure ahead of this weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix after seven years

'I'll keep the memories of the great moments lived together, the friendships and the satisfaction of always giving my all. 

'I will always be grateful for the opportunity given to me by [former owner] Vijay Mallya, who believed in me in 2014 and allowed me to continue my F1 career with Force India.

'To the current administration, led by Lawrence Stroll, I wish nothing but the best in the future, especially with the upcoming Aston Martin project.'
