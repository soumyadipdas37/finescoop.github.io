They've just rekindled their friendship, after his split with KC Osborne. 

And on Wednesday, Stacey Hampton and Michael Goonan proved they're getting along better than ever as they caught up for lunch.

Michael shared a video of the pair as they grabbed a bite to eat, showing Stacey playfully slapping him as she dissed his sunglasses.

'Just out for lunch, baby loves my sunglasses,' Michael said.  

'I hate them, they're disgusting,' Stacey replies, before giving Michael a soft backhand. 

'What's wrong with them?!' he replied. 

Stacey also reposted the video on her Instagram story and captioned it: 'If you've never back handed your ex. Then you haven't dated a Michael.'

On Friday, Michael and Stacey first hinted that they've rekindled their friendship when Michael shared a video of the former couple in happier times.  

'Reminiscing when we were friends,' he captioned the video and tagged Stacey. 

The clip featured a scene of Stacey throwing Michael's clothes out the window of a hotel room.

The millionaire's plea to Stacey came after his break up with his MAFS co-star KC Osborne back in July.

KC revealed to WHO magazine in July, his failed promises of changing his 'playboy' ways was a factor in their breakup.

'He sold me that dream of ''I would stop my playboy ways to have a girl like you, you're such a good girl," she said.
