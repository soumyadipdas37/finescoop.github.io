Manchester United captain Harry Maguire has made his first public appearance since his ugly ordeal in Mykonos after attending the Soccer Aid match.

Maguire returned to familiar and comforting surroundings of Old Trafford as a guest of the annual charity match, between England and a Rest of the World side.

The 27-year-old posed for a picture at pitch-side alongside United legends Wayne Rooney and Bryan Robson, before taking his seat in the stand. It was the first time he has been seen out and about since his now infamous arrest.

It is the first time Maguire has been seen in public since his arrest in Greece on the holiday island of Mykonos.

The defender was ejected from Gareth Southgate's England squad as a result, and is missing UEFA Nations League fixtures with the national side.

Maguire has appealed his convictions and will face a full retrial after his legal team filed an appeal against the decisions last week.

In a statement printed in Greek publication Protothema, one of the arresting officers on the night of the scrap recalled Mr Maguire, 27, launching a torrent of abuse as he was placed under arrest.

The statement alleges Mr Maguire shouted: 'F*** you all, f*** off, f*** the Greek police, f*** policemen, f*** Greece, f*** the Greek civilisation, I don't give a s***'.

The statement adds that Maguire, 'attacked the sergeant...he pushed him away and kicked him in the right leg causing swelling of his left and right tibia.'

England boss Southgate has however promised Maguire a quick return to the England squad next month as he revealed they have been in constant contact.

'I think we've talked right the way through very openly and honestly, and, of course, Harry would prefer to be here with the team,' said Southgate.

'He wants to play football and he wants to be part of it. 

'But I think with everything that's gone on in his life in the last couple of weeks it was so important that he's been able to let everything just calm down, get some more time on holiday. He hasn't really had any sort of a break.'
