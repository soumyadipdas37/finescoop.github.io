Kacey Musgraves and Ruston Kelly have finalized terms of their divorce just months after announcing the end of their relationship.

The 32-year-old country singer and her estranged husband are waiting on a judge to sign off on the final divorce decree, according to TMZ.

Part of their agreement includes selling their Nashville, Tenn. home, with Kasey receiving 84.4% of the sale while Ruston receives the rest.

The couple agreed that their prenuptial agreement was valid when filed prior to marrying two years ago.  

Musgraves and Kelly confirmed the news of their split in July via their representatives, saying: 'We've made this painful decision together.'

'With heavy but hopeful hearts we wanted to put our own thoughts into the air about what's happening. These kinds of announcements are always met with scrutiny and speculation and we want to stop that before it even starts,' the statement continued, which was shared to the Associated Press.

The statement continued: 'We believe that we were put into each other's lives for a divine reason and have both changed each other infinitely for the better. The love we have for each other goes far beyond the relationship we’ve shared as husband and wife. It's a soul connection that can never be erased.' 

'We've made this painful decision together — a healthy decision that comes after a very long period of trying the best we can. It simply just didn't work. Though we are parting ways in marriage, we will remain true friends for the rest of our lives.'

The couple concluded: 'We hold no blame, anger, or contempt for each other and we ask for privacy and positive wishes for us both as we learn how to navigate through this.'

Locked lips: The pair (pictured 2019) are said to have first crossed paths in early 2016 at the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville

Both stars have since deleted their wedding photos from their Instagram accounts. 

Ruston Kelly is also a singer-songwriter, and got his first cut with Tim McGraw's song Nashville Without You, that appeared on McGraw's album Two Lanes of Freedom.

In November last year, Kacey attended the CMA Awards with Gigi Hadid as her date instead of Ruston. 

The pair are said to have first crossed paths in early 2016 at the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, where they were both while attending a songwriters’ showcase. 

Last year, Kacey said she couldn't have created her Grammy-winning record Golden Hour without being inspired by the love of husband Ruston, who she first met around the time she began writing the LP.'

'After meeting this person who really allows me to just be myself, not have to walk on eggshells for any reason, songs started pouring out,' the country star revealed in a cover story for Glamour. 

'That whole time period was a big opening of heart for me,' Musgraves began, 'I started to see the world in a more fond, pretty light.' 

'His songs made me really emotional. I thought, This guy's really clever, whoever he is,' she said.

Cheeky! In November last year, Kacey attended the CMA Awards with Gigi Hadid as her date instead of her husband Ruston 

After getting to know each other and then collaborating on songs, the pair fell for each other.

'And then it was "That’s all she wrote.",' Kacey joked, 'Pun intended. Everything was right.'

She said that things came naturally, which was a new experience for the star.

'I didn't have to shift any part of my personality to make it fit together,' she explained, 'Which isn’t really something I've had before.'

'If I wouldn't have blocked off time to get off the road and try to create a new album and have the time to explore creatively, it makes me wonder if I would have met him. It was perfect timing.'
