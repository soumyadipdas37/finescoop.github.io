Claire said: 'She wrote the track for herself but realised it wasn't really for her and gave it to us.

'It's not like it was in the bottom of a drawer somewhere. It was her who said, ''We should give this to Steps because it would really suit them''.'

Lisa gushed about the opportunity to work with the singer: 'I am such a huge Sia fan. Her music is completely up my street, I have so much admiration for her as an artist and a songwriter so I'm in pop heaven.'
