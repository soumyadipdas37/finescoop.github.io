Police have refused to apologise after a failed bid to prosecute a learner driver for overshooting a red light by a few feet.

Joseph Bell, who was 17 at the time of the incident, has been granted an absolute discharge after he was stopped at a junction in Nottingham in December last year.

The student was having a lesson with his driving instructor, who was able to take charge if needed, and paused in the zone for 14.8 seconds.

Footage showed there was no oncoming traffic or pedestrians, with the magistrates' court hearing Mr Bell pulled up to the intersection at a slow speed. 

Mr Bell, who is now 18, admitted to failing to comply with the traffic light signal but will not be charged a fee or have any points added to his driving licence. 

Despite the ruling, Nottinghamshire Police still backed their decision to defend the case.

Inspector Simon Allen told the BBC: 'The safety of all road users is paramount, which is why the law holds learner drivers equally accountable and they must ensure that they follow the rules of the road.

'In these cases, drivers have the choice to take a ticket or to go to court as happened here.' 

Mr Bell expressed his relief over not having any points added to his licence and his mother, Gaynor, said she was frustrated with the force's move. 

Bruce Stuart, defending Mr Bell, said: 'This is something that learner drivers do - they make mistakes.'
