A children's doll company has copped even more backlash after a mother spotted a tiny penis on one of its popular toys.   

Bianca Stone, from Queensland, bought the L.O.L Surprise! doll from a local Coles for her daughter on Monday only to discover X-rated private parts. 

'It was certainly a big (little) surprise when my five-year-old unwrapped her new L.O.L doll to find he was anatomically correct,' she told 7News.

Ms Stone took a photo of the seemingly innocent doll wearing a t-shirt and pants, but after taking the toy's clothes off a small penis could be seen.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted MGA Entertainment for comment.

The X-rated surprise comes a month after Big W removed a series of L.O.L surprise dolls from their shelves in response to a series of complaints after a mother exposed the toys' 'hidden feature' online. 

Kate Worsfold, from Brisbane, went viral in August after uploading a Facebook video demonstrating how the popular toys changed into lingerie and bondage clothing when dunked in cold water.  

The brand, made by American company MGA Entertainment, is sold at toy stores across Australia, including Target, Kmart, and Big W. 

Big W, owned by Woolworths group, told Daily Mail Australia that one range would be stripped after customers expressed concern.

'We have listened to our customers' concerns and have made the decision to remove the range of LOL Surprise #hairvibes dolls from our shelves,' a Big W spokesperson said. 

'We continue to work closely with our supplier to ensure that future ranges of LOL Surprise at BIG W are consistent with our customer's feedback.'

The line, marketed for children aged six and up, features little girl figurines that are stylised to look like adults. 

Disturbing sexualised outfits appear on dolls bodies once dipped into icy water, including shackles around the wrists, nipple coverings, skimpy underwear, tattoos, suspenders, long black boots and body nets.  

One doll when chilled had the word 'caution' scrawled over her private parts. 

While Ms Worsfold welcomed Big W's change, she said removing only one range of the dolls was not 'good enough'.

Some dolls' secret outfits include body nets, tattoos, nipple coverings, long black boots and suspenders

'As far as I'm concerned you don't just pull one weed out, you pull them all out, one does not make a difference,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It is like they are pulling just one range to keep customers quiet. It falls under their accountability. Silence is consent.'  

Louise Newman, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, said the dolls fall into a longstanding culture in marketing practices of sexualising young children. 

However, she said campaigns have alarmingly shifted towards hiding messaging compared to past advertisements which were more transparent in their goals to sell adult products to children. 

'There is a lot of concern about what is being marketed to children and how it models adult sexualisation,' she said.  

'There is a subliminal message that being sexy and flirty when they are young is appropriate. Children need to be learning about sexual behaviour in the context of growing up.' 

She said the practice is dangerous as it can de-sensitive children to adult sexuality, potentially making them more vulnerable to predators. 

'One thing predators will count on is kids being vulnerable,' she said.

'This sort of marketing is a part of a culture of breeding that it is okay for children to be exposed to these messages, and people are not on the lookout for it like they should be.

'If kids are getting a message that it is okay to do sex things, some people will take advantage of that.

'There needs to be more control over what is marketed to children and a push to avoid sexualised advertising. Children do not need this. It does not need to be there.'

Parents from across the world have been flocking to online forums to share photos of the hidden outfits they have discovered on their daughters' dolls
