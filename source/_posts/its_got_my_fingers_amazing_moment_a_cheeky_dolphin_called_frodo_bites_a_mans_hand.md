A cheeky dolphin named Frodo sunk his teeth into a man's hand during a friendly open ocean encounter.   

Fisherman Ty Duncan said he had repeatedly come into contact with the playful animal near Noosa, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, over several years.   

Mr Duncan recorded his latest interaction with the Frodo on Friday as the dolphin approached his outstretched hand before biting down on his fingers. 

Fisherman Ty Duncan filmed his close open ocean interaction with a friendly dolphin named Frodo (pictured above) near Noosa, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, on Friday 

Heartwarming footage showed Frodo swim up to Mr Duncan's small fishing boat and lift his head and jaws out of the water.

The dolphin happily held on to Mr Duncan's hand as he laughed and exclaimed 'it's got my fingers'. 

'The bite doesn’t hurt at all, it was just playing. That specific dolphin is always super friendly. 

'It might recognise my boat or something. I’ve seen him for at least the last five years,' Mr Duncan told Daily Mail Australia. 

Mr Duncan said he had shared multiple encounters with the playful animal and described him as 'the friendliest dolphin I've ever met'. 

The fisherman has even swum with the aquatic mammal on one occasion.  

'Other dolphins will keep their distance and won't really engage but this one, as you can see, doesn't mind it at all,' Mr Duncan said.    

The video showed Frodo have another nibble at Mr Duncan's fingers and allowed him to pat its head.   

Mr Duncan said he had encountered the playful dolphin multiple times over the years and recorded it playfully biting his hand (pictured above)

Viewers of the 'adorable' footage were quick to voice their praise for the 'cute' dolphin. 

'It seems like dolphins are the golden retrievers of the sea,' one commenter said. 

'It just wants to have a swim buddy, jump in and have a go at it,' another user wrote.  

Other commenters said the encounter was 'sick', 'cool', and 'amazing'.  

Mr Duncan's footage also showed the dolphin happily swimming underwater and around the boat.  

Dolphins are aquatic mammals that inhabit every ocean in the world.

There are 36 species of dolphins and most live in the ocean and along coastlines. Some dolphins also inhabit freshwater streams and rivers. 

They are grey coloured and have curved mouthes, which resemble a smile, with a row of jagged teeth.  

Dolphins often live in pods that can be made up of twelve or more animals. 

They are intensely social and communicate with squeaks, whistles, and clicks.  

Dolphins mainly feed on fish and squid and use echolocation, a built-in sonar, that bounces sound waves off prey to reveal its location and size. 

They are playful and curious creatures that are known to interact with humans.
