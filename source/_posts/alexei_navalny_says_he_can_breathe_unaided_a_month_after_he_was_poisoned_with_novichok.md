Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he can now breathe unaided a month after he was allegedly poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok. 

'Hello, this is Navalny,' he said in a post on Instagram, appearing with his family in the Berlin hospital where he was flown for treatment after falling ill.

'Yesterday I was able to breathe on my own all day,' he said in his first social media post since he was poisoned in Siberia.

Doctors at the Charite hospital say Navalny's condition 'continues to improve', announcing yesterday that he was able to leave his bed for short periods.

Friends of Navalny have suggested his tea was spiked in an airport cafe in Tomsk where he was pictured shortly before boarding a flight on August 20.  

After Navalny fell ill, the aircraft made an emergency landing in Omsk and he was initially taken to hospital in the Siberian city. 

The following weekend he was airlifted to Berlin, where doctors at the Charite hospital treated him with the antidote atropine and kept him in a medically induced coma. 

On September 2, the German government announced that a military lab had found evidence of Novichok, the Soviet-era nerve agent used to target Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.    

Western leaders have piled pressure on Russia to explain how Navalny was poisoned, but the Kremlin has denied involvement and played down Germany's findings.  

Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. 

He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.

The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. 

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia's arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.
