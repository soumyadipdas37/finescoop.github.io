Premier Inn owner Whitbread has warned it could axe up to 6,000 jobs as the coronavirus crisis continues to hit demand for hotel stays. 

The hospitality company also owns Brewers Fayre, Beefeater and Table Table restaurants, while operating around 800 Premier Inns across the country. 

Thousands of jobs have been lost across Britain as the financial impact of Covid-19 continues to hit the economy. 

Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn along with several restaurant chains, has announced up to 6,000 jobs cuts

Data released this month shows more than 300,000 jobs were put at risk of redundancy in June and July - nearly seven times higher than last year's levels. 

On September 9, Lloyds Bank announced it was cutting 865 jobs, just days after the Cooperative Bank revealed it was to axe around 350 jobs from up and down the country and close 18 branches.
