Parents locked down in Melbourne can rejoice after a little-known rule revealed they are entitled to an extra hour of exercise with their children.

Stage Four restrictions enforced in the coronavirus-riddled city mean residents can only exercise for one hour a day and with only one other person.

But a rule that has been clarified on the Department of Health's website has now indicated parents can go for an additional hour of exercise with their children.

'Parents or carers of children can take their children for one hour of active outdoor play outside the home,' the DHHS website says.

'This is separate to the one hour of exercise allowed for parents or carers each day.'

Melbourne residents can only leave their homes to exercise, to give or receive care, work or study or for necessary shopping (pictured woman running in the Tan on August 24)

The website also said to reduce the risk of spreading the killer virus, only the minimum number of parents or carers should accompany the child.

The huge revelation comes five weeks into the lockdown which has seen residents stuck inside their homes only permitted to leave for four reasons.

These include to exercise, to give or receive care, work or study and for necessary shopping.

The strict Stage Four restrictions were imposed on August 2 with Premier Daniel Andrews saying all exercise was to be done within the neighbourhood. 

'Recreational activity is no longer allowed, you'll be allowed to have one hour of exercise no further than 5km from your home that means it's fresh air, it's a jog, it's a walk, it is in you local neighbourhood,' he said.

A DHHS spokesperson said the exercise rule was not new but would benefit workers who have changing schedules like frontline workers.

It comes as Mr Andrews is expected to announce the state's road map out of lockdown on Sunday.

A leaked top secret draft for the city's exit road map earlier revealed the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks.

The Victorian government however said the road map was 'out of date'.

According to the leaked documents, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.

The clarified exercise rule will benefit parents and carers who have altering work schedules (pictured woman walks near the Tan in Melbourne last month)

Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.

According to the report, which was obtained by the Herald Sun, that from September 28, up to five people, including children, from up to two households will be allowed to meet outdoors for social interaction. 

Outdoor personal training would be allowed for up to two people per trainer and outdoor pools will open for exercise for up to 20 people at a time.

Victoria recorded 76 new COVID-19 infections and 11 deaths on Saturday.
