The Great British Bake Off has released a first look trailer ahead of the new series. 

The topical 40-second video is set in the height of lockdown and even pokes fun at the flour shortage.

The trailer sees the nation frantically searching for the key baking staple as a young boy cycles to his grandmother's house to deliver the precious ingredient.

Zaid Al-Qassab, chief marketing officer at Channel 4, said: 'This year's Great British Bake Off campaign highlights that baking is about so much more than sustenance - it's a gift.

'The film illustrates the nation's joyous love of baking, inspired by our shared experience of lockdown in a typically Channel 4 way, and we hope it gets viewers as excited as we are for the return of our biggest show!'

The trailer is set to debut on Channel 4 television screens at 9pm on Tuesday evening.

GBBO revealed just last week they had finished filming for the upcoming series. Posting a picture of the iconic kitchen to Instagram, they penned: 'Filming has wrapped on the new series of The Great British Bake Off. More news soon...' 

Filming for the next season began last month at a private location in Essex, just a stone's throw from judge Paul Hollywood's home. 

Despite being considered a high-risk candidate for coronavirus, his co-host, Judge Prue Leith, 80, will still be presenting on this year's show. 

Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air.

She credited stringent health and safety measures, testing and quarantine regimes for the return of the hit baking series.   

Meanwhile it has been reported that judge Paul wants to continue using his trademark move in the upcoming Great British Bake Off season, despite fears of spreading coronavirus.  

The baking maestro, 54, intends on defying social-distancing rules as the Channel 4 program clarified they will follow strict safety protocol so that all parties are free to handshake to their heart's content.  

According to a report in The Sun, Paul has been given the green light to handshake cast members as producers believe the show wouldn't be the same without his signature move.

To ensure safety at all times, the upcoming season is being filmed in an isolation bubble, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing. 

A source said: 'In these strange times, producers want the 2020 series to be as close to normal as possible and they feel that it wouldn’t be the same without a Hollywood handshake. 

'The judges and hosts — and the contestants — have all been deemed clear because of the bio-secure bubble and regular testing.

'So if the baking is up to scratch, we’ll see some handshakes, and not elbow bumps, being dished out before long.'

Paul's handshake is widely regarded as the golden ticket for bakers who aim to meet his high expectations or win Star Baker of the week. 

The first time that fans witnessed Paul's congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. 

The program was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.  

Fellow Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig revealed that she had left the show earlier this year and was replaced by Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas 

Matt will partner up with fellow funnyman, Noel Fielding, 47, who originally joined the Great British Bake Off Cast in 2017.
