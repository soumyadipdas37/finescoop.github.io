Ha! Alison Hammond is up to her cheeky antics once again in her appearance on the first episode of Ainsley Harriott's new ITV show Ainsley's Food We Love

Alison appeared delighted to be showcasing her culinary skills on the show, during which Ainsley asked what her favourite kind of holiday is. 

She replied: 'I like the type of holiday where you really explore the culture. I'm not a beach person but I'm more of a pool person...

'I want to meet the people of the environment. If I go to Florida, I want to meet people from Florida. If I go to Tunisia, I want to meet the Tunisians'.

She then went in to detail about the very starts of her showbiz career - before her stint on Big Brother's third series in 2002.

That was then! She told the hilarious story (pictured in June last year)

Alison said: 'I love Tunisia. It's one of my favourite places to go. I went there with my friend and the entertainer in the hotel had left...

'The next thing i know Ainsley, I'm on the stage on my holidays entertaining the kids doing mini disco, singing I Am The Music Man, the kids loved it!...

'The manager came up and asked if I want to get a job and I didn't have a job at the time. So you never know - by going on that holiday I wound up in that sort of career. That's how I got that kind of career!'

Ainsley then pointed out: 'You never know what's around the corner!'

The appearance come after it was reported that Alison is gearing up for more screen time as ITV are planning to give her a chat show. She has already recorded a pilot episode for her show titled Happy Hour, according to The Mirror.

 She said of the series: 'There's exciting things coming up.'

Last month, Alison was showered with praise, when she joined Rochelle Humes to serve as a main co-presenter on ITV's This Morning.

Oh no! But Alison appeared to shoot down fans' dreams of seeing her in the main seat more often, when she jokingly agreed on Twitter that she would be 'too much' as a daily host on the popular daytime show

Loose Women star Stacey Solomon disagreed with the sentiment, tweeting in response: 'It was the best [s]how EVER IMO.'

Rochelle, 31, had stepped in to co-host the show on Fridays and was joined by Alison, who made her debut as co-host despite being a This Morning mainstay for 17 years. 

Ainsley's Food We Love kicks off on Saturday at 11.35am on ITV.
