What a gorgeous lady:Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber were seen at the shoot in Italy for the Versace campaign in June amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And the highly anticipated ads for the luxury brand's fragrances have finally dropped, featuring the two models rocking skimpy swimwear

The sultry ad, which mainly features Bella with a brief appearance by Hailey, kicked off with Bella rocking a crop top and tiny string bikini bottoms - both in black.

Bella is the face for the Versace Dylan Blue fragrance, while Hailey is fronting the second parfum - the Versace Dylan Turquoise fragrance.

Hailey shared her campaign ad for the Turquoise scent to her Instagram on Wednesday. 

In the Dylan Blue ad, Bella kicked off the video wearing large gold earrings with her brunette tresses slicked back into a bun as she posed in front of large rock.

The camera went up and around the rock as someone is heard saying 'the world turns around and around' as three other models lounging on the rock are seen.

It comes up to the other side and Bella is seen now lounging in the sand wearing a sheer chiffon blue dress with a gaping midsection - revealing her midriff and glimpses of her cleavage. She was also wearing a plunging bathing suit beneath.

The next scene was Bella in a patterned bathing suit on the beach as she held on to a large magazine that said Versace on the front of it, with designer Donatella Versace on the front.
