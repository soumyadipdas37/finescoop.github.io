Retired AFL star Shaun Smith has been awarded a $1.4million payout for the pain and suffering he endured from multiple concussions during his career.

Smith, who is known for taking the 'Mark of the Century' in 1995, was found to have suffered 'total and permanent disablement (TPD) due to the multiple head injuries on field during his 109 games between 1987-1998.

The 51-year-old former North Melbourne Kangaroos star was awarded $1.4million on Thursday from his Insurance company, MLC, and has now set a precedent for other sports stars.

Smith requires ongoing treatment to manage his symptoms, daily medication and can no longer work 

'This just proves that concussion is real – that we are not just making this stuff up. I'm only the tip of the iceberg,' Mr Smith told Herald Sun after his landmark win.

His frightening medical report revealed there was 'deep white matter' on the brain which has led to depression, pervasive suicidal ideation, feelings of hopelessness, social withdrawal, insomnia, and poor short-term memory.

Smith said agent Peter Jess 'saved my life' and not when it came to the money, but rather that he believed him.   

'I'm eternally grateful to Peter Jess. The guy has saved my life, really. Not just with the financial side of things but making me realise that I'm not stupid or going crazy.'

Smith's Mark of the Century was against the Brisbane Lions over teammate Garry Lyon at the Gabba in 1995.

Smith is pleading with current AFL players to stop while their ahead before they ruin their lives. 

Mr Jess is now pushing the AFL to urgently address the issue for their former and current players saying it should be a 'game changer'.    

He has also warned about players with the game's main insurer, AMP, that they might not get a payout unless they had another disability.    

An AMP spokesman claimed they regularly review their insurance policy to ensure it remains in line with the demands of AFL.
