Christine, who has daughter Patricia, 12 months, with husband Frank recently resumed her work duties presenting daytime shows Lorraine and Loose Women. 

While Frank has been busy rebuilding and training the Chelsea squad with some big money signings. 

The Chelsea coach has been married to Christine since 2015, and he recently told The High Performance Podcast that she offers him sensible advice about how to manage his team.

Frank - who also starred for Chelsea before he turned to coaching - said: 'She definitely coaches me. And I do throw a lot of things off Christine.

'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home [and ask].

'It's a different view, a different opinion.'

Frank admits he values Christine's outlook on some of the situations he faces on a day-to-day basis, and the former England star is happy to approach his wife for tips.

He said: 'Sometimes, I go, "Christine, what do you think about this problem? I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday. But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?"

'And she goes, "Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them." And I'm like, "yeah". I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'
