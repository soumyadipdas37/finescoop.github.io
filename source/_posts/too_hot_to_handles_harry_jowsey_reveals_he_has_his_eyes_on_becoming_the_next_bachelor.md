His split with his Too Hot To Handle co-star Francesca Farago back in June made headlines.

And now Harry Jowsey has his eyes on a new reality TV gig - The Bachelor.

The 23-year-old revealed to Hollywood Raw podcast with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn on Thursday: 'I would f***ing love to be The Bachelor. Hands down.'

'That's my goal': Too Hot To Handle's Harry Jowsey has revealed he has his eyes on becoming the next Bachelor in the US

 'In LA it's pretty easy to date 20 girls, but they're not really interested in you,' he added. 

'On The Bachelor I find there are girls that are genuinely interested in you and genuinely interested in finding something special. Trying something different and going out of a comfort zone to do that.'

The Aussie Netflix star said he thinks he would make 'a funny bachelor.'

'It would be a good opportunity for me to find someone who is genuinely in it for me and wants to try to build something special. That's my goal. Hopefully one day they will reach out,' he continued.

The Queensland-born hunk noted that there was 'talk' of him signing on to be the Australian Bachelor, but implied he preferred to be on the American version. 

'I think American Bachelor is where it's at. I'm just a sucker for accents. I find that Americans and Canadians are just the hottest people,' he said. 

Harry and Francesca confirmed their split back in June, just days after she flew in from her home in Vancouver, Canada to be with him in Los Angeles.

The pair, who met on the Netflix dating show Too Hot to Handle, had been living apart for months because of the border closures.

During an Instagram Live video at the time, he said: 'Nothing bad happened. I simply fell out of love, I lost that massive spark that I had at the start of the show. 

'Feelings change, not all relationships work out. If you can't give someone 110 percent, then there's no point.'

In Francesca's YouTube tell-all, titled 'Our Breakup', she seemed to agree with Harry that the long distance was partly to blame for their split, but said he was the one wanted to breakup.  

'I cannot fake a relationship. I cannot pretend like everything is going to be okay,' the reality TV star sobbed as she dabbed her eyes with a tissue. 

In late July, Harry went on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast and claimed that Francesca's behavior during 'the worst week of his life' influenced the split.

Specifically, he said that there had been a death in the family, 'someone really close to me' attempted suicide and his mother was injured falling from a horse.

He claimed that when he contacted Francesca and asked her to 'be here for me,' she was holidaying with an ex in Las Vegas and accused him of trying 'to ruin her trip.'

In late July, he also told the Courier Mail that he had lost about 200,000 Instagram followers amid her public comments on the breakup, and that he was looking at the possibility of a legal response.

'I can't believe it, it's damaging my brand. I've been nothing but nice to her and regarding the reason why we broke up, because of stuff she did,' he said.

Meanwhile, Francesca said on Violet Benson's Too Tired To Be Crazy podcast in early August: 'I think that every single girl knows that when a guy calls a girl crazy it's just a reflection of their actions I think because Harry knows I'm not crazy.'

'If I was crazy… I would be pulling some whack s*** right now to ruin his career because I literally could if I wanted to so,' she continued.

'With everything that I know and I've been so respectful considering everything he put me through,' added the brunette. 

In recent weeks, Francesca has been out in LA with Bachelorette US star Jef Holm.
