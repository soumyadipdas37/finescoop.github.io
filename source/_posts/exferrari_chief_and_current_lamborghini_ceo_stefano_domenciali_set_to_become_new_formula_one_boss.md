Stefano Domenciali is set to become the new head of Formula One, taking over from current chairman Chase Carey. 

The 55-year-old made his name in F1 at Ferrari, having been involved in the car manufacturer company for 23 years between 1991 and 2014, but is now the chief executive of Lamborghini. 

It is understood the Italian has yet to sign the contract with F1 and announcement from either party has not been made, but Domenciali is still expected to take on the role next year.

Carey, who has held the role since Liberty Media took over Formula One in 2017, is expected to stay on as chairman despite Domenciali's arrival .

The Italian chief is best known for helping Ferrari win the 2008 Constructors' Championship through his role as Sporting Director of the F1 team. 

He first joined Ferrari in 1991 working in the finance department before being promoted to head of personnel in the team's sporting sector in 1995. One year later, he was promoted once again to Team Manager. 

Domenciali held the position of Ferrari team principal between 2008 and 2014

At the turn of the century, Domenciali became Ferrari's Logistics Manager before taking the Sporting Director role. 

He stayed in that role until 2014 where he resigned after then-president Luca di Montezemolo asked him to sack Ferrari's engine head, which the Italian refused to do. 

Domenciali has also held developmental roles at Audi while he was appointed head of the FIA's Single-Seater Commission shortly after leaving Ferrari.

Domenciali has been chief executive of Automobil Lamorghini since March 2016

Furthermore, the Italian was the race director of the Mugello Circuit in Tuscany between 1992 and 1994 while he has also held senior roles at several other racing circuits, including Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. 

Domenciali has also been part of Channel 4's F1 racing coverage for selected races since 2019 .  

The 55-year-old has been at Lamborghini since March 2016 when he succeeded Stephan Winkelmann.
