She recently returned from a romantic trip to Crete in Greece with her beau, Callum Jones, where she displayed her flawless sun-kissed tan and abs once more.

Always on trend, the TV star exuded confidence in a leopard print bikini, paired with some lavender tinted sunglasses and simple gold necklaces.

With a white shirt draped over her shoulders as a cover up, the influencer had been keeping fans engaged with a series of snaps from their romantic getaway.  

Molly and Callum, 24, have been an item ever since they met on the 2020 winter series of Love Island. 

However the iconic summer show has since been cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic, with questions raised as to whether it will be safe to return in January for another series.

To recover from the drought of a Love Island-less summer, ITV2 have been airing the Australian version of the hit series, and the USA rendition hit the small screen on September 7.
