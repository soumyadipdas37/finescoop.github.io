She's not one to post racy pictures to social media, but Delta Goodrem gave fans a rare glimpse of her taut middriff on Thursday.  

The 35-year-old's Voice co-star and best friend, Renee Bargh, 35, shared a clip to Instagram that featured the girls trying on leopard print activewear in the Spell Boutique in Byron Bay. 

'Can't take us anywhere,' Renee captioned the clip.

In the video, Rene is posing in front of a large mirror in a crop top and a pair of exercise shorts.  

The Born To Try singer is seen jumping into the frame showing off her taut torso, similarly dressed in a patterned crop top and exercise leggings. 

Excited by her visit to the store, the boutique also shared a number of snaps that featured Delta posing with staff members.

It comes amid calls from fans to remove Delta from her role as a judge on The Voice. 

Following rumours that the singing competition won't feature any international stars next year, fans flocked to Facebook on Thursday begging for Seven to axe Delta as well.

'If they get rid of Delta I might actually watch this. Can't stand her,' one viewer wrote

'Please no more Delta!' another begged.



Changing of the guard? Elsewhere, one fan suggested that Seven replace the Born To Try singer with Tina Arena

Delta has long received criticism for her supposedly 'annoying' and 'theatrical' behaviour on The Voice.

Speaking to the September issue of Marie Claire, the Born To Try favourite said she was left 'absolutely broken' by some of the negative feedback she received.

'I don't think all of [the criticism] was fair but there's a lot I can reflect on,' she said.

'At the time [of The Voice's first season], being 27 and on TV, my brain could compute that it was part of the cycle. But it still hurt me.'

Rather than letting the negativity get her down, Delta said she has learned to grow a thicker skin.

'It's one thing to know of something. It's another thing to have walked it. The chapter taught me resilience and made me stronger. What a gift,' she said.
