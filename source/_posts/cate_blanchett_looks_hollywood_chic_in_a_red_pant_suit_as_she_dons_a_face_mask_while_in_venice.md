She is currently acting as the Jury President for the 77th annual Venice Film Festival. 

And on Saturday, Cate Blanchett was sure to turn heads as she left her hotel in the Italian city in a chic red and burnt orange ensemble. 

The 51-year-old actress looked relaxed as she sported a blue face mask during the outing.

Cate is heading the jury at the Venice Film Festival during a historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she told the AFP in regards to her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.'

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.
