They appeared to make up after the disastrous trip, however, Ray J had been self-isolating away from his wife and children amid the coronavirus pandemic.

'I’m lonely right now. I don’t want to quarantine by myself. I keep telling Princess, but she says: "If I see one person over there with you, you got to start over," he told the outlet. 

Ray J said: 'So I really have to lock myself in, because I really miss my kids.'

He shared: 'She said I got to put in seven days alone, and I'm good with the seven, but she really want me to do 14, so it's hard to look at the 13 days left.'
