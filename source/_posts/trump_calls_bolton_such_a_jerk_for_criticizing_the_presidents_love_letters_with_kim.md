President Donald Trump went after his former National Security Advisor John Bolton Monday, days after Bolton called Trump 'despicable' for his disparagement of American war dead that was reported in the controversial Atlantic article. 

'Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed "love letters from Kim Jong Un" as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously, was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!' Trump tweeted around lunchtime Monday. 

It was unclear where Bolton made the comments that got the president steamed, though during a Bloomberg Radio appearance Friday the ex-staffer who has since penned an anti-Trump book, lent weight to The Atlantic's reporting. 

President Donald Trump photographed Sunday returning from golfing in Virginia. On Monday he went after former National Security Advisor John Bolton days after Bolton criticized Trump for what was reported in the Atlantic, that he had called American war dead 'losers' 

Trump tweeted that Bolton had criticized him for calling correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 'love letters,' saying that he was 'being sarcastic.' 'Bolton was such a jerk!' Trump added 

Former National Security Advisor John Bolton told Bloomberg Radio, 'I have not heard anybody say, "Oh, that doesn't sound like the Donald Trump I know,"' about The Atlantic's reporting that Trump called servicemembers 'losers' and 'suckers' 

'I have not heard anybody say, "Oh, that doesn't sound like the Donald Trump I know,"' Bolton said. 

He couldn't, however, confirm Trump had called Marines who died defending Paris in World War II 'losers,' a comment the president allegedly made on a November 2018 trip to France. 

Bolton said he didn't hear it himself. 

'Now, did he say those things to other people later in the day?' Bolton said. 'It's certainly possible.' 

Bolton said it was 'despicable' what Trump reportedly said about American servicemembers. 

While a number of administration officials have come out and defended Trump, both the Associated Press and Fox News Channel corroborated chunks of The Atlantic's reporting. 

Trump said Monday that he was 'being sarcastic' about Kim's (pictured) 'love letters' to him, despite boasting about those 'love letters' at a September 2018 rally in West Virginia. 'He wrote me beautiful love letters, and they're great letters,' Trump said at the time 

As for Trump's claim that he was 'being sarcastic' about Kim's 'love letters,' he, in fact, has boasted publicly about said 'love letters.'  

'He wrote me beautiful love letters, and they're great letters,' Trump said at a September 2018 rally in West Virginia. 'We fell in love.

In February 2019, before the second Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, which ended without any sort of nuclear deal, The Washington Post reported that White House officials were jokingly calling the correspondence 'love letters.' 

Officials who saw the letters told The Post that Kim called Trump 'Your Excellency' and complimented the American president's political prowess and energy. 

The president has shown the documents to dozens of Oval Office guests, the newspaper also reported.
