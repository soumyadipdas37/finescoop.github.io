For the past week, Katie Holmes has been packing on some serious PDA with her  new flame, Emilio Vitolo Jr. 

But on Saturday, the 41-year-old Dawson's Creek alum stepped out for a solo grocery run wearing a green and blue flannel in New York City. 

After stocking up on the essentials, the actress could be seen navigating down the sidewalk with a large reusable tote bag on her shoulder and a black face mask.  

Blissful: Katie Holmes stepped out for a solo grocery run wearing a green and blue flannel in New York City, after going public with her new flame, Emilio Vitolo Jr.  

The Logan Lucky star appeared in high spirits, as opted to leave the top button on her blouse undone to flash a hint of her sun-kissed skin and a dainty gold necklace. 

Holmes styled the laid-back ensemble with a pair of loose-fitting navy sweatpants, flip flops and her raven tresses in a messy bun. 

Meanwhile, her rumored 33-year-old boyfriend enjoyed a smoke break from his job at his father's famous Nolita restaurant, Emilio's Ballato, which is frequented by stars including Bradley Cooper and Barack Obama.

Working hard: Meanwhile, her rumored 33-year-old boyfriend enjoyed a smoke break from his job at his father's famous Nolita restaurant, Emilio's Ballato, which is frequented by stars 

While the pair were just romantically linked seven days ago, they've been spotted smooching and cuddling all over the Big Apple.  

On Wednesday, DailyMail.com revealed that Vitolo broke up with his live-in fiancée 24-year-old Rachel Emmons by text when handsy photos of him and Holmes were published, blindsiding the handbag designer and forcing her to move back home. 

Additionally, Holmes and Vitolo had been getting to know each other since October and she was reportedly aware he was engaged.  

Not shy: This week, the lovebirds were seen kissing outside various restaurants in New York City, including Holmes sitting on Vitolo's lap and planting a kiss on him 

The two were introduced by mutual friends and their fling has intensified since the actress returned to NYC this summer after quarantining with her family in Ohio, according to a source close to the actress.

The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with playboy Jamie Foxx, 52, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.

Holmes is now acting 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something Jamie couldn't' the source added.

The source said: 'Jamie broke Katie into pieces. It took Katie a while to get over it and she had a lot of drunken nights.' The pair never officially confirmed they were dating but attended the Met Gala together in 2019 (pictured)

This week, DailyMail.com published photos of the lovebirds kissing outside various restaurants in New York City, including Holmes sitting on Vitolo's lap and planting a kiss on him.

On Tuesday, Vitolo and Holmes were seen passionately kissing one another at his father's restaurant. The chef's father Emilio Vitolo Snr. sat close by, proving that Holmes is already well in with the family.

The insider said: 'Maybe she's just enjoying this fling because she's had such a hard six years with Jamie.' 

They added: 'Jamie broke Katie into pieces. It took Katie a while to get over it and she had a lot of drunken nights.

'Everyone is surprised by the way this romance happened and how open Katie is being about her new man.

'Some of her relatives are upset, they do not understand why Katie acts like a teenage girl in love with so many silly and ridiculous displays of love, she is 41 years old and they expect her to act like one.' 

Indeed, it's certainly a surprise to see Holmes put on such a public display of affection, as she has previously been notoriously private about her personal life. 

Sparks are flying: Holmes is now acting 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something Jamie couldn't,' the source said

She was married to Tom Cruise from 2006 to 2012. During that time they had daughter Suri, now 14, who is often seen accompanying Holmes.

After that Holmes began dating Jamie Foxx, who she was first linked to in 2013 when the pair was seen strolling hand in hand through Malibu.

The pair never officially confirmed they were dating, but attended the Met Gala together in 2019.

But by summer reports of a split began to emerge after Foxx was photographed holding hands with singer Sela Vave, 21, that August.

At the time insiders told People the two split months earlier because the relationship had run 'its course,' explaining: 'This industry is very tough on relationships.'

They went on to say there were no bitter feelings between the pair, who simply grew apart.
