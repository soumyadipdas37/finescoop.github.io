Urzila Carlson replaced Lindsay Lohan as a judge on The Masked Singer this season.

And it seems the 44-year-old comedian hasn't wasted any time developing a keen eye for guessing the celebrities behind the masks.

She told Who magazine on Thursday that she paid close attention to less-obvious clues, such as the singer's body type and even their gait.

The Masked Singer's Urzila Carlson revealed the subtle clues she looks for that give away a star's identity - and they have nothing to do with the cryptic clues or their voice

'Rather than focus on the voice, I've been studying people's height and body shapes. So if some big muscular guy is in the costume, he could be a rugby player,' she said.

'If the person looks like they could run underneath a coffee table, it's probably Dannii Minogue trying on a costume!' she joked.

Urzila also admitted that she did 'CSI-level' investigating on the Instagram accounts of local celebrities.

Subtle clues: The 44-year-old explained to Who magazine on Thursday that she studied subtle clues such as people's body shapes, builds and even their walk. She said: 'if some big muscular guy is in the costume, he could be a rugby player'. Pictured is Frillneck

Hints: Urzila also admitted that she did 'CSI' level investigating on the Instagram accounts of local celebrities. 'If certain Australian-based celebrities had big gaps between posts, could it be because they're at a photo shoot,' Urzila said. Pictured is Bushranger

'If certain Australian-based celebrities had big gaps between posts, could it be because they're at a photo shoot in a hammerhead costume? See? I told you I went totally CSI on this,' she added.

After filming the majority of the show in Melbourne, Urzila recorded her parts for the season finale from a hotel room in New Zealand on Tuesday night.

Meanwhile, host Osher Günsberg and fellow panellist Jackie 'O' Henderson filmed their bits from Sydney, and Dave Hughes and Dannii Minogue stayed in Melbourne.

Production at Docklands Studios had been suspended on August 22 after a COVID-19 outbreak on set, which forced the entire cast and crew into two-week quarantine.

Channel 10 and Warner Bros. permitted Osher, Jackie and Urzila to leave Melbourne once their isolation period ended, and they filmed their segments remotely.

The Masked Singer finale airs Monday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
