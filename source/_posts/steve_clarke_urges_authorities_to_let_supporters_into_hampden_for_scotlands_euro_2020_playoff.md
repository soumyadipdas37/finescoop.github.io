Steve Clarke has urged UEFA and the Scottish Government to let the fans back in for next month's Euro 2020 play-off against Israel.

A Nations League dress rehearsal for the main event saw the sides draw 1-1 behind closed doors at Hampden last night.

Ryan Christie's penalty before half-time was cancelled out by an Eran Zahavi equaliser 18 minutes from time.

Despite Monday's second leg of the double header trip in the Czech Republic, however, focus has already turned to the critical rematch with the Israelis on October 8.

And, with the Scottish Government poised to give the green light to test events for the return of a restricted number of fans to SPFL grounds next weekend, Clarke appealed to the powerbrokers to ease coronavirus restrictions before the play-off semi-final.

'I'd like to think there will be a crowd at the play-off, some sort of crowd inside the stadium to help the atmosphere.

'I think it would be helpful for any game as I'm a big believer that football is a game for spectators.

'You need the fans there to push you on.

Clarke says having the Tartan army roaring them on will give them the boost needed

'Maybe in the second half tonight we sat in a little too deep because we were so comfortable in the game defensively. We went to sleep on a throw-in and got heavily punished for it.

'I think if the fans are in here in the stadium they're shouting and pushing you up the pitch and driving you on. So yeah, it would make a difference.'

While players have become used to performing without fans in grounds Scotland's first game in ten months was a first behind closed doors for the manager. Admitting the game was a mixed bag Clarke added: 'It was very surreal. From the moment we left the hotel, the players were on one bus and the staff were on a different bus.

'We drove into the stadium and there was almost nobody here.

'Then during the game it has a little bit of a training ground feel to it.

'But I thought both teams acquitted themselves well. It probably wasn't the most exciting game to watch but it was quite tactical.'

Scotland drew 1-1 with future play-off opponents Israel on Friday, with Ryan Christie scoringÂ 

Scotland grabbed the opening goal from the penalty spot in 43 minutes when John McGinn was clattered in the area.

Despite a better performance in the second half and a heartening debut for Lyndon Dykes up front Clarke's decision to field Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson in a 3-4-2-1 formation failed to claim all three points on the first step towards Qatar 2022.

With all still to play for in the quest to reach a delayed Euro 2020 finals, however, Clarke acknowledged: 'Both teams have now had a little look at each other ahead of the play-off.

Clarke acknowledged both teams had a chance to look at each other ahead of the face off

'We both played strong teams so it wasn't as though there was anybody kidding on or hiding. Both teams played for the points.

'Between now and next month's game we'll both have a look at the video to see what we can do.

'But our next game is the Czech Republic away and they had a good win tonight. We go there expecting a difficult game but we hope to get a result.'
