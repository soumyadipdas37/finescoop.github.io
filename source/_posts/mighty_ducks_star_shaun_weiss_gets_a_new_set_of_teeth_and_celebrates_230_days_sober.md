Former child actor Shaun Weiss has been diligently working on his recovery from drug abuse after falling on hard times and recently celebrated his 230th day sober.

The Mighty Ducks star, 42, also had a new top row of permanent teeth installed following multiple oral surgeries done to correct the damage done to his mouth from years of meth use. 

His friend Drew Gallagher shared an update on his condition to his GoFundMe page on Tuesday, along with a photo of Shaun looking better than he has in years as he flashed a bright smile.  

Looking good! Mighty Ducks actor Shaun Weiss recently celebrated over 230 days in recovery from meth addiction and, in an update posted to his GoFundMe page, recently had a row of permanent top teeth installed

'Got his permanent uppers installed,' Gallagher wrote. 'Getting closer to a full face of teeth.'

In the photo, Weiss smiled from ear to ear with his new teeth, showing off a his healthy, rounded face and a short trimmed beard. 

At the time that the photo was taken, Weiss had celebrated more than 230 days sober after years of abusing meth and other drugs. 

The Mighty Ducks actor has been making steady improvements since first seeking treatment for an addiction to meth. 

'Got his permanent uppers installed,' his friend Drew Gallagher wrote on the page. 'Getting closer to a full face of teeth.'

Throughout his recovery, friend and supporter Drew, has shared various updates on his condition and last month revealed that despite the long road ahead, Shaun was doing better than ever. 

'Weiss is thriving,' he wrote. 'His face and mouth feels like "tenderized meat" as he recovers from each oral surgery, but he is feeling blessed to be getting a new set of permanent teeth.' 

The astronomical costs of the dental work are being covered generously by his dentist, Dr. Gabe. 

'Dr Gabe has covered all costs and it's allowed Shaun to use the gofundme funds to pay rent at his sober-living as well as buy some groceries,' Drew wrote in an update over the summer.

Adding: 'He's even got an inexpensive laptop so he can access the internet. Still a long road ahead but growing each week!'

As of September, the page had raised over $13,000 in donations for the suffering child star.  

Drew has also posted photos of Shaun throughout the process, providing visual proof of his improvements which went from gaunt and sickly to smiling and healthy. 

When the donation page was started, the biggest hurdle in his recovery was seeking adequate dental care, which thankfully, came through. 

'Dr Gabe has covered all costs and it's allowed Shaun to use the gofundme funds to pay rent at his sober-living as well as buy some groceries,' Drew wrote in an update over the summer

'Any Dentist willing to help Weiss that's our current biggest need,' Drew wrote in June describing his dire condition. 'He has no teeth and it's an added discomfort I'm trying to alleviate.'

According to the American Dental Association, methamphetamine use can lead to severe tooth decay and cause teeth to break or fall out.

While the drug is acidic and can wear down tooth enamel, meth can also lead to spells of dry mouth, which increase the likelihood of tooth decay, and the psychological effects of meth can lead users to go without regular brushing or proper dental care. 

Shocking: In recent mug shots Weiss (here in January), looked extremely gaunt and disheveled. He was living on the streets and suffering from numerous health issues

The actor, who played Goldberg in Disney's hockey-themed Mighty Ducks films,  had been living on the streets, and had turned to crime. 

In a mugshot from an arrest for burglary in January, Shaun looked shockingly gaunt and disheveled after years of drug use. 

Weiss finally got the help he desperately needed after he was released from jail and ordered by a Yuba County, California judge to complete a 90-day rehab program following a week-long detox at a center in Orange County, California.

Sources said at the time that the plan was for the Montvale, New Jersey native to finish an outpatient program and take part in a sober house program until he's cleared to stay in a sober living home.

According to TMZ, executives with an unnamed television series helped coordinate Weiss's stint at the costly rehab facility. (A Mighty Ducks reboot is in production with Disney+.)

Weiss was taken into custody January 26 in connection with residential burglary and being under the influence of meth, and held on $52,500 bail, according to a release from the Marysville Police Department. 

Police said that a resident in Marysville, California, a community about 125 miles northwest of San Francisco, contacted them after discovering Weiss on their property.

Responding officers said Weiss broke a window to slip into the vehicle he was found hiding in, in the garage of the home.

Weiss, who was arrested on the spot, 'displayed symptoms of being under the influence of methamphetamine,' police said. The actor told police that he was trespassing and broke into the vehicle that was not his.

The actor has been plagued with drug and legal problems the past few years, as he was also arrested in connection with public intoxication in August 2018 in Oroville, California. He was also arrested for shoplifting in December 201.

Before that, in 2017, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail after he was arrested in connection with meth possession in Burbank, California.
