A drastic breakthrough in negotiations is required if England's Jadon Sancho is to finalise a move to Manchester United within the next month.

United have trailed Sancho all summer but are making little progress in talks surrounding the agent fee for brokering a move and the player's salary.

Discussions between the two parties are ongoing, albeit slowly, and United will not negotiate a fee with Borussia Dortmund until a deal has been reached with the 20-year-old's representatives.

Manchester United are in need of a drastic breakthrough to seal the signing of Jadon Sancho

Dortmund value Sancho at more than £100million and want him to remain at Signal Iduna Park for the season. United want a resolution to specifics pertaining to the contract before approaching the German side.

The stagnation leaves United with a race against time if they are to land the winger in an area of the pitch Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hopes to add further quality.

They retain an interest in RB Leipzig's Dayot Upamecano as defensive reinforcement, although that move appears geared towards next summer.

The Borussia Dortmund and England star has been United's top priority all summer

Upamecano - who has been trailed by a host of top European sides after a strong last year in the Bundesliga - would cost significantly more than a £38m release clause that does not kick in until 2021.

United would face stiff competition for the France international's signature if they held back on firming up their interest this month.

Meanwhile, it is understood that United have not yet prepared a bid for Real Madrid left back Sergio Reguilon.

The Red Devils have failed to make progress in talks for the move with the German side
