She welcomed her first child, son Oscar, with husband Peter Stefanovic in February.

And on Monday, Sylvia Jeffreys shared a sweet photo to Instagram of the six-month-old dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time.

In the hilarious picture, which was taken at Sydney's Bronte Beach, the child screwed up his nose and did not appear to be enjoying the milestone.

'It was all fun and games until his toes touched the water,' Sylvia, 34, captioned the snap.

'Definitely a Queenslander,' she added, referencing the fact that both she and Peter, 38, were born and raised in the Sunshine State.

In the image, Peter held on to Oscar reassuringly as he took his first dip in the ocean.

Much better: Peter later shared an image of Oscar looking much happier back on the sand as he cuddled up with his mother (Sylvia and Oscar pictured) 

The baby looked adorable in a powder blue cap, grey T-shirt and patterned shorts.

Peter, who hosts Sky News' breakfast show, displayed his fit physique by going shirtless in a pair of red boardshorts.

Sylvia, who hosts Nine's Today Extra, protected herself from the sun in a large straw hat and sunglasses, and also wore a denim jacket and shorts.

Despite Oscar being just six months old, Silvia is eagerly practising her baking skills ahead of his first birthday.

She recently revealed she was planning to make a racing car cake for the big day in February.

She even made a trial cake, and kindly gifted it to her Nine colleague Ben Fordham.
