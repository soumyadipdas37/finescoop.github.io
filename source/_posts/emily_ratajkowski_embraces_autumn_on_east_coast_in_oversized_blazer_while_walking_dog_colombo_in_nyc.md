Emily Ratajkowski recently dropped a bombshell on the fashion industry, as she recounted the sexual assault she experienced during a photo shoot.

And the Inamorata founder is keeping her head held high, as her friends and fans rally around her in support.

She embraced autumn on the East Coast, as she sported an oversized tan blazer and a Yankees baseball cap, while walking her dog Colombo through her New York City neighborhood.

The 29-year-old paired the open coat with a black top, distressed straight leg jeans and a pair of white sneakers.

She finished the look with some black cat-eye sunglasses, gold hoop earrings and a black face mask.

Ratajkowski opened up Tuesday in a personal essay for The Cut about being assaulted by photographer Jonathan Leder in 2012, during a shoot at his home in Woodstock, New York.

She detailed the lingerie he had her wear, before asking her to go nude, as he offered her one glass of red wine after another.

Later, after the makeup artist for the unpaid shoot went to bed, she and Leder sat on the couch, where she 'absentmindedly' began rubbing her feet against him for warmth.

The Gone Girl actress wrote: 'Most of what came next was a blur except for the feeling. I don’t remember kissing, but I do remember his fingers suddenly being inside of me. Harder and harder and pushing and pushing like no one had touched me before or has touched me since.'

A few years later, she learned that he was selling a book of risqué photographs from the unpaid shoot, which she originally only gave permission to use in a magazine.

Leder provided a copy of a release, which granted him the necessary rights, claiming it was signed by her agent at the time. 

The photographer's representatives have since released a statement, denying her allegations: 'Mr. Leder completely denies her outrageous libelous allegations of being "assaulted." It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive about the publication of the photos.'

Ratajkowski took to Instagram after the essay was released, as she thanked her 26.8million followers for their support.

She wrote: 'It’s been nothing short of life-changing to see how many women (and men!) this piece resonated with. 

'Thank you to every single person who read, shared, commented and tagged me. I can’t tell you what it feels like to see my words in print and to hear from each and everyone of you. Thank you.'

The I Feel Pretty actress later expanded on the issue with V Magazine, opening up about how she's evolved over the years as a model and entrepreneur in the fashion industry, as well as how she's approached fragile masculinity.

She told friend and photographer Inez Van Lamsweerde: 'In general, you have no control. When I was younger, I just kind of let things happen. And I struggled with that. 

'I’m so glad that I don’t [have to do that] now. I’m not this passive person who is not in control. I’m 29, so I’m kind of leaving [that] behind.'

Ratajkowski continued: 'I understand, with love, that men’s experiences have been really limited. The way that men feel and process shame is so different. 

'You have to teach them about experiences that you, as a woman in the world, [have had]. Expose them to that.'
