Rebel Wilson turned heads on Wednesday when she debuted her new boyfriend, Jacob Busch, at Prince Albert's Planetary Health Gala in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

But besides her new beau, all eyes were on the Australian comedian's incredible weight loss.

The 40-year-old stunned in a glittery gown from the Rene Ruiz Collection.

The figure-hugging gown flattered Rebel's physique and highlighted her recent weight loss.

'Damn you're looking really good. Proud of you!' gushed one fan on Instagram.

 

'Just be healthy. Don't listen to Hollywood. You’re amazing and beautiful and ENOUGH exactly as you are,' they added.

Another fan wrote: 'You look beautiful. Congratulations on your weight loss.'

Rebel has been on a health and fitness journey this year, losing at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).

Last month, she highlighted her weight loss as she shared several photos to Instagram of her slimmer frame in a tight blue wrap dress.

The Bridesmaids star explained that she was inching closer and closer to her goal weight of 75kg.

'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she captioned the post.

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead.'

She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'

The post comes after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

'So for me 2020 is going to be called 'The Year of Health'. So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she told her Instagram followers.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'
