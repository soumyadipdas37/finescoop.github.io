With yoga mats costing anywhere of up to £100, you'll be pleased to hear that shoppers have found an impressive designer dupe on Amazon. And, as it's now in the sale, you can snap it up for a very affordable £14.99. Bargain.  

The Core Balance TPE Yoga Mat has already received over 260 ratings with an impressive average score of 4.5 out of 5. Shoppers are raving about the 'excellent quality', calling it 'super comfortable' and 'really sturdy'.

The best match of price and quality, the mat is transforming home workouts- you don't even have to be into yoga to make the most of a yoga mat. They are great for HIIT classes (high-intensity interval training), Pilates or even just for a good stretch.

You can now save 40 per cent on the top-rated Core Balance TPE Yoga Mat, now on offer on Amazon for only £14.99

Whether you're looking to ease your way back to the gym or you prefer to turn your front room into your own mini workout studio, a yoga mat is a versatile bit of kit to help you get the best out of your fitness routine. 

While thicker mats offer superior comfort, thinner mats are better for stability. With the Core Balance TPE Yoga Mat, you don't have to compromise. The unique structure gives you the best of both worlds, so whether you'll be practising your downward dog or sweating it out with burpees, this is a top choice. 

At 6mm, the Core Balance TPE Yoga Mat is definitely on the thicker side so a great choice if you suffer from sore knees and hips. Whereas standard fitness mats measure 61cm wide, this yoga mat measures 65cm wide, giving you that extra room for your workouts.

'I am really impressed with this yoga mat. The quality is excellent, and the thickness of the foam completely eliminates the feel of hard floor beneath the mat. The mat does not move at all on a laminate floor, allowing you to practice with ease. I'm so pleased I bought this product it has made my at-home practise much easier.'

The £14.99 price tag is very reasonable considering the quality. Nicely cushioned and non-slip, it's not hard to see why the yoga mat comes highly recommended by Amazon shoppers of all exercising backgrounds.

'I really needed a good quality but not too expensive yoga mat. This is perfect. Wide, long, non-slip, comfortable and gorgeous colour. So glad I chose this one.' 

Another agreed, writing: 'Was very surprised by the quality of this item for such a competitive price. Would strongly recommend it.'

Most yoga mats measure 61cm wide but the Core Balance mat measures 65cm so gives you greater flexibility and freedom of movement when you're working out

Unlike a lot of traditional yoga mats, the Core Balance mat is made out of high-density TPE foam, which is non-toxic and free from harmful chemicals, so it's a great option for those with sensitive skin. 

You'll also get a carry strap with the mat- ideal for bringing with you to classes, but if you'd rather work out from the comfort of your own home, then this folds up neatly. 

'I originally used my mat for yoga, pilates and body balance. It is a bit thicker than some mats, and so provides a bit of extra support and protection I find. Since lockdown and fitness classes being cancelled, I have used my mat for online legs, bums and tums. It means I can exercise without having to wear trainers or on an uncomfortable surface like carpet.'
