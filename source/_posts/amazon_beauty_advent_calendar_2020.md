Beauty advent calendars get bigger and better every year, and this year is no exception. Amazon has just revealed its Beauty Advent Calendar for 2020 brimming with an amazingly affordable selection of bestsellers.

Costing just £60, but worth over £215, the limited-edition advent from Amazon Beauty is one of our favourites of the season.

It's now available for pre-order and will officially be launched later this month. But given the success of last year's advent, it will likely sell out before its October 15 release.

Whether you want to treat yourself or the beauty fan in your life, the Amazon Beauty Advent Calendar 2020 is the ultimate festive treat.

The calendar contains 24 festively patterned boxes, each hiding a deluxe or full-sized beauty product from the e-tailer's virtual beauty halls.  

Favourites include nail polish in a holiday-red hue from NailsInc, deluxe Emma Hardie Moringa Cleansing Balm, and NIP+FAB Extreme Glycolic Fix Liquid Glow, as well as a Sleek MakeUP iDivine Eyeshadow Palette and even a full-sized Soothing Apricot Toner from Elemis.

It has a good balance of beauty products and includes all the ones you need to create festive makeup looks.

Not to mention, the calendar itself is beautifully decorated, featuring a simplistic holiday-inspired alpine design and boxes adorned with candy cane stripes and graphic patterns for an extra festive touch.

Last year's Amazon Beauty Advent Calendar sold out shortly after launch, and the 2020 calendar is all but guaranteed to sell out too, so we suggest snapping it up fast.

The Amazon Beauty Advent Calendar 2020 is on now available for pre-order.

For those who want a sneak peek inside, here's a full list.
