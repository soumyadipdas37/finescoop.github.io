A mother has given her dining room chairs a clever upgrade with stylish grey fabric covers for $196 - a fraction of the price she would have paid for a new set.

Karly Meljak had grown tired of the black leather seats in the kitchen of her Port Macquarie home, but 'didn't want to spend a fortune' on new furniture in case her three-year-old daughter ruined them.

Instead, the budget savvy mum-of-one from New South Wales gave them a new lease of life with fabric covers from Spotlight, Australia's leading supplier of arts, crafts and home interiors.

Ms Meljak shared her idea in a Facebook cleaning group, revealing she had bought eight Ardor Surefit Urban Dining Covers in an online sale which saw them marked down from $35 to $24.50.

'Spaghetti nights - no problems, just remove darling daughters cover during dinner,' she wrote in the caption.

'However if there is a stain just remove, treat and put in washing machine. So in love with my new chairs.'

Available in 'Grey Marle' and 'Seafoam', a shade of eggshell blue, the covers are stitched from elasticated polyester that's 'easy to work with' and 'instantly gives your room a fresh new look'.

And in good news for those who want to follow Ms Meljak's lead, they are still reduced to $24.50, while stocks last.

Covering eight chairs like she did would cost just $196, a reasonable price for stylish new upholstery.

Hundreds of comments under photos of the revamped dining chairs praised the idea, with many saying it's exactly what they need for their own homes.

'Wow I have the same chairs and I'm not a fan anymore either. These could be a good compromise until I replace them!' one mother replied.

'This is what I did when our five-year-old came along. So easy to wash,' said another.

A third added: 'Yassssss (sic)! I have a pretty similar set and have wanted to change the chairs for a long time. Thank you so much for posting this!'

Others said they had bought similar covers on eBay for a fraction of the cost.

'It was around $26 for six, I grabbed two sets,' one woman said.
