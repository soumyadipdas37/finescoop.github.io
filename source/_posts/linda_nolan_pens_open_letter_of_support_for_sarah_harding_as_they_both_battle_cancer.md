Linda Nolan has shown her support for Sarah Harding after both stars were recently diagnosed with cancer.

Linda, 61, penned an open letter for Sarah in New! Magazine, telling the Girls Aloud star, 38, that she was 'shocked and devastated' to hear that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Singer Linda was recently diagnosed with incurable cancer in her liver, her third recurrence following breast cancer in 2006, cellulitis and lymphoedema in her arm in 2007 and secondary cancer on her pelvis in 2017.

Linda's sister Anne, 69, was meanwhile diagnosed with stage three breast cancer just days before her diagnosis, while their sibling Bernie died from cancer in 2013.

Linda began her open letter by telling Sarah, 'I was so shocked and devastated to hear about your breast cancer diagnosis.'

She went on to advise the former girl band star that going public with her diagnosis is a positive step, explaining: 'If I can say anything to you, the support you'll get from the public will be amazing - it was overwhelming for my sister Anne (who is also suffering from breast cancer) and me.'

'People are genuinely lovely and want to wish you the best. Initially, I didn't want people to pity me, but it was weight off my shoulders when it came out and I hope you're feeling a sense of relief too.'

She went on: 'This is my third time of being diagnosed with cancer now and each time is just as scary.

'But once you get your head around it - and you've got a supportive family, which I know you have - before you know it you'll be at the end of your chemo treatments.'

Linda concluded her letter: 'I started my chemo in June and thought 'I'm never going to get to September,' and now I've got two treatments left. And you get into a routine with it.

'Although you're feeling rubbish, remember it's treatment to make you better. As you've said, the doctors are amazing and give you so much support, but don't be frightened to ask questions.'

Sarah revealed her battle with breast cancer in an emotional Instagram post last week and shared that the cancer had 'spread to other parts of her body.'  

Sarah is said to have made emotional phone calls to her Girls Aloud bandmates about her cancer battle just days before she made a public statement.

According to reports, the singer spoke to Cheryl, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts before publicly announcing she has 'advanced' breast cancer. 

It has been claimed that the group are with their friend 'every step of the way' and the news has brought them closer than ever.

Sarah announced the heartbreaking news with a snap taken from her hospital bed, as she explained she'd been undergoing weekly chemotherapy sessions, but the cancer has spread to 'other parts of her body.'

She wrote: 'Hi everyone, I hope you are all keeping safe and well during these uncertain times. 

'I've not posted on here for so long, thank you to everyone who has reached out to check in on me, it really does mean a lot.

'I feel now is the right time to share what's been going on. There's no easy way to say this and actually it doesn't even feel real writing this, but here goes.

Tragic: Sarah told fans she'd been battling the disease for several months with weekly chemotherapy sessions

'Earlier this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a couple of weeks ago I received the devastating news that the cancer has advanced to other parts of my body.'

Sarah continued: 'I'm currently undergoing weekly chemotherapy sessions and I am fighting as hard as I possibly can. I understand this might be shocking to read on social media and that really isn't my intention.

'But last week it was mentioned online that I had been seen in hospital, so I feel now is the time to let people know what's going on and this is the best way I can think of to do so. 

Close: Sarah is said to have made emotional phone calls to her Girls Aloud bandmates about her cancer battle just days before she made a public statement 

'My amazing mum, family and close friends are helping me through this, and I want to say a thank you to the wonderful NHS doctors and nurses who have been and continue to be heroes.

'I am doing my very best to keep positive and will keep you updated here with how I'm getting on. In the meantime I hope you'll all understand and respect my request for privacy during this difficult time. Sending you all so much love….xx.'

All of the Girls Aloud members sent their support, with Cheryl, 37, tweeting a 'broken heart' emoji after Sarah announced the news.



 



We're with you: Posting on Twitter, Cheryl shared a single broken heart emoji, while Nadine insisted she will continue to support her old friend during the crisis. Nicola and Kimberley also showed their support for Sarah later that day 

Nadine, 35, wrote: 'I love you!! You have always been able to achieve miracles when needed!! I am here for the all ways & always will be!!!'

Clearly shocked by Sarah's diagnosis, Nicola, 34, tweeted: 'It goes without saying that this is blindsiding. @SarahNHarding you're so loved and supported.'

Kimberley, 38, also sent her love to her former bandmate, writing: 'My heart is broken. You are so strong and brave and we are with you every step of the way.'

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated?

What is breast cancer?

Breast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts.

When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an 'invasive' breast cancer. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.

Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare.

Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.

The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing. High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.

What causes breast cancer?

A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'.

Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics.

What are the symptoms of breast cancer?

The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign. 

The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.

How is breast cancer diagnosed?

If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray.



How is breast cancer treated?

Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.

How successful is treatment?

The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.

The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.
