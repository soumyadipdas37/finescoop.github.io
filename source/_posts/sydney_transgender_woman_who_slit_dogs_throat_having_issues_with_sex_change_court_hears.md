Olivia Sindel, 24, (pictured) allegedly tortured, beat and slashed the throat of her ex-lover's English Staffordshire Bull Terrier Rocky

A woman who allegedly tortured and slashed the throat of her ex-lover's dog was suffering from 'significant issues' related to gender re-assignment treatment, a court has heard.

Olivia Sindel, 24, has been charged with torturing, beating and causing the animal's death in the alleged attack at a home on Cahill Place in Marrickville in Sydney's inner-west at 1.30am on Saturday.

The 13-year-old English Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Rocky died despite being rushed to a vet and the attempts of his owner, 44, to save him - while Sindel was arrested by police on Oxford Street in Surry Hills about 4.20pm that day.

Sindel on Sunday faced Parramatta Bail Court where magistrates heard she had been slamming her head and needed to be sedated by paramedics when police tracked her down.

Mental health experts advised the accused animal killer be kept under supervision to prevent her from harming herself, the court heard. 

She showed a red mark on her head to the court during the bail hearing, which ended with the 24-year-old being detained for her psychological care.

The accused stroked her hair and rocked backwards and forwards during her appearance,The Daily Telegraph reported. 

Sindel's address was listed as an Ultimo hotel. 

'There are significant issues because of the gender reassignment treatment,' Sindel's Legal Aid lawyer said.

'First thing she said to me was that she wanted me to kill her.'

The young woman is also accused of harassing someone in Armidale in northern New South Wales using a landline on the same day as the alleged attack.

Sindel was taken to Surry Hills Police Station after her arrest and charged with torture, beat and cause death of animal. 

She was also hit with two charges of stalk or intimidate, two counts of contravening an AVO, two counts of breaching her bail and one of using a carriage service to menace or harass.
