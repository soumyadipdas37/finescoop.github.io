'Demi wants no contact with Max at this point,' the source said. 'She is completely embarrassed at the way he's been acting and putting their relationship on blast via social media.' 

Adding that despite Max's attempts to 'reach out,' and 'denial' that their relationship is over, the Sorry Not Sorry hitmaker 'wants nothing to do with him.' 

Demi has been posting selfies and photos spending time with family and friends since their split was reported on Thursday.  

Though the source claimed the actor was attempting to contact Demi privately, Max took to his Instagram Stories again on Monday to speak out about their split. 

'One chapter finally closed this AM,' he wrote. 'And now I turn the page.'

'Focused on wellness, love, God, my family, friends and my art,' he added. 'Good vibes only.'

His posts came after other Instagram Stories he made on Saturday claiming he found out about their split in the tabloids. 

A source told People on Saturday that Demi, made Max 'aware that the relationship was over and it was going to come out in the press.'  

Not over? The actor posted a stream of Instagram Stories, on Sunday which he deleted, in which he claimed the former couple have not spoken and 'haven't even officially ended anything to each other'

'Up to this moment we haven't spoken over the phone... we haven't even officially ended anything to each other,' Max wrote on Sunday. 'Literally. I'm here in real time with y'all. I love Demetria and just want her to be healthy and safe.'

He wrote in another Story: 'If you're reading this ... I love you always.... unconditionally... not matter what,' and then included grabs of some of Demi's hit songs and encouraged people to listen, praising her voice, and tellings fans she 'deserves' a Grammy.

'Imagine finding out to the status of your relationship through a tabloid,' he wrote. 'While your [sic] in the middle of filming a biopic movie about a Pastor in a Christian Church whose intention of the film is to help people'

A source later told E! News that he was 'lying' about the tabloid claims and knew of their split before it became public.

Whilst another insider added: 'She doesn't trust him and thinks he's sketchy... She feels he proposed to get attention.'

A third source explained: 'Things started going downhill [when he said he was flying out to Atlanta for work]. They were arguing a lot and Demi didn't want him to go without her... There has been a lot of tension and Demi left him to get a clear head.'

They added: 'They have respect and love for one another and will always cherish the time they spent together.'

Demi and Max have had a whirlwind romance, that started in March just before the coronavirus pandemic began. 

And sources later revealed that they had decided to quarantine together at Demi's house amid the lockdown.  

Demi and the former soap opera actor quickly began boasting about their love on social media.  

They announced their engagement in July, alongside a beachside photoshoot showing off Demi's shining diamond ring.  

Earlier this month, Demi admitted they were considering eloping amid the pandemic limiting large gatherings to 10 people.

The singer shared that she wants their wedding to be 'sacred' between them, as she dished to Popcrush Nights.

Seeming torn between a big wedding and eloping she said 'On one hand, I would love to elope because my life is so public and I want to keep it sacred between me and him. 

Adding: 'On the other hand, I want my friends and family to be there for a celebration. But I can't do that until the pandemic's over because it's not safe.'  

In a separate post on Monday, he went on to explain that articles referencing his Facebook page were 'fake news.' 

'I don't post on Facebook or Twitter,' he wrote. 

Twitter seems to have been a sensitive subject for the couple towards the end of their relationship, after Tweets, videos and Instagram Live videos of Ehrich professing his love for Selena Gomez resurfaced online. 

Fans claimed to have screenshots of tweets and other social media posts by Max pitting Demi and her former BFF Selena Gomez, against each other. 

Real or fake? More posts have emerged this week showing Max's alleged obsession with Selena Gomez

Admiration: It also appears that Max has a similar tattoo to the singer

Demi took to Instagram earlier this month to seemingly debunk a slew of viral screenshots that showed rude tweets made by Max, in 2015.  

'It's really sad when people FAKE images to put women against each other. If women have conflict that's between them NOT YOU,' the former Disney star wrote. 

In the tweets, Max allegedly wrote that Lovato's former best friend Selena  was 'prettier' and more vocally gifted that her.

And this week, following the split, more posts have emerged where Max appeared to write to Selena 'Marry me now' during live broadcasts.

He is also said to have got a matching tattoo, just like the one of a musical note on Selena's wrist.

There is a blog dedicated to uncovering max's alleged past posts about his love for Selena. He is also accused of setting up fake profile about him and Selena being the 'perfect couple'.

Before their split, when rumors of Max's obsession first emerged, Demi passionately challenge the validity of the past tweets and she went as far as to urge 'tabloids' to write about 'more important sh*t.'  

Selena is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.

Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained.
