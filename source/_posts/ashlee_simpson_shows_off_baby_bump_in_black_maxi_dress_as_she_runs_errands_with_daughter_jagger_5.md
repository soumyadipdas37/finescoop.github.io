Ashlee shared her happy baby news via social media on April 30, showing off her positive pregnancy test.

A gender reveal event in June revealed she's expecting a boy.

She already has a son Bronx, 11, from her first marriage to musician Pete Wentz which ended in divorce in 2011 after three years of marriage. 

The younger sister of pop star Jessica Simpson tied the knot with Diana Ross's son Evan in August 2014 at his legendary mom's estate in Connecticut.

Their daughter Jagger was born on July 30, 2015.  

Speaking to ET recently about their marriage, Evan said: 'The biggest thing in this world is being in love. I’m so in love. I love my daughter, I love my wife. She’s given me the best gift in the world. I’m very lucky.'

As they prepare for their new arrival, the celebrity couple have  purchased a 6,250-square-foot home in LA's upscale Encino neighborhood for $4.5 million. 

So happy: 'The biggest thing in this world is being in love. I’m so in love. I love my daughter, I love my wife. She’s given me the best gift in the world. I’m very lucky,' Evan recently told ET
