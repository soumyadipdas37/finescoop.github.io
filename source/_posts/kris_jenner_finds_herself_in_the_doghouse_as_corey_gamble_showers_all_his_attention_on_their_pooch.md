Kris Jenner showed off her jealous side in the latest teaser for Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

The 64-year-old momager was miffed when her 39-year-old beau Corey Gamble started lavishing all his attention on their pooch Bridget.

Little did Kris know that Corey was playacting at being obsessed with the dog in order to needle her about not doing much of the work of caring for Bridget.

Baby mine: The 64-year-old momager was miffed when her 39-year-old beau Corey Gamble started lavishing all his attention on their pooch Bridget

'Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like 99.7% of all dog duties,' Corey shared with the viewers in a confessional. 

'So what I think I gotta do now is all the attention that I used to give Kris, I think I gotta just give it all to Bridget. So maybe this could actually get her attention and she'll start giving me a little support and help on the parenting side.'

At the start of the clip Corey and Kris bundled into the car together and his 'favorite person on the planet' Bridget clambered into the back.

Making it happen: Little did Kris know that Corey was playacting at being obsessed with the dog in order to needle her about not doing much of the work of caring for Bridget

The truth will out: 'Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like 99.7% of all dog duties,' Corey shared with the viewers in a confessional

His plan: ''So what I think I gotta do now is all the attention that I used to give Kris, I think I gotta just give it all to Bridget,' he shared

There's an idea: He explained: 'So maybe this could actually get her attention and she'll start giving me a little support and help on the parenting side'

Trio: At the start of the clip Corey and Kris bundled into the car together and his 'favorite person on the planet' Bridget clambered into the back

Kris noted they were 'supposed to be going to lunch' but Corey said he 'wanted to bring the baby because she should be at lunch with us.'

When they arrived at the restaurant Corey opened the door for 'my little sweetheart' Bridget prompting Kris to mouth to the camera: 'What happened to my door?'

After they were seated Corey ordered a grilled chicken breast side order 'for my sweet little daughter,' much to Kris' bemusement.

Wine arrived and Corey toasted to 'good health, more wealth, and lots of love, right, Bridget?' prompting Kris to give the camera a sidelong glance.

Neglect: When they arrived at the restaurant Corey opened the door for 'my little sweetheart' Bridget prompting Kris to mouth to the camera: 'What happened to my door?'

Corey started rattling off plans to bring Bridget on a Palm Springs trip and to a Lakers game and to get her a customized watch.

'What?' said Kris as he waxed rhapsodic about the dog. 'Are you insane?' to which Corey cradled Bridget and said: 'I'm insane for her.'

When Kris vamped that she had 'some competition,' Corey said: 'Competition? No one comes before Bridget.'

Corey, who began dating Kris in 2014, said: 'There's Bridget, then the world. She's number one, and  you're...Kris.'

Cheers: After they were seated Corey ordered a grilled chicken breast side order 'for my sweet little daughter,' much to Kris' bemusement

Seriously?: Wine arrived and Corey toasted to 'good health, more wealth, and lots of love, right, Bridget?' prompting Kris to give the camera a sidelong glance

His ruse appeared to be working on Kris as she said in a confessional: 'Corey really thinks that he's Bridget's dad, like for real.'

The current season premiered last week on the heels of news that Keeping Up With The Kardashians was coming to an end on E! after more than a decade. 

Keeping Up With The Kardashians soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of Kris and all six of her children.

Early last week a Page Six report alleged that Khloe Kardashian and Scott Disick were against the cancellation of the show.

Big ideas: Corey started rattling off plans to bring Bridget on a Palm Springs trip and to a Lakers game and to get her a customized watch

Banter: 'What?' said Kris as he waxed rhapsodic about the dog. 'Are you insane?' to which Corey cradled Bridget and said: 'I'm insane for her'

By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'

Scott shares three children with Kris' eldest daughter Kourtney Kardashian - sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. 

Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.

The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.

Laying it on thick: When Kris vamped that she had 'some competition,' Corey said: 'Competition? No one comes before Bridget'

Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'

To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.

'She's number one, and you're...Kris': Corey, who began dating Kris in 2014, said: 'There's Bridget, then the world'
