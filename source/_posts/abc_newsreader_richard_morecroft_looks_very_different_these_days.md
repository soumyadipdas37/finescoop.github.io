Former ABC newsreader Richard Morecroft is living his best life after quitting journalism and moving to rural New South Wales 18 years ago.

After almost two decades hosting Sydney's nightly news bulletin, the 64-year-old left the city in 2002 for a quieter life near Jervis Bay, where he focuses on environmental work and his passion for photography.

Fans were offered a rare glimpse into Richard's retirement on Sunday when his former Letters and Numbers co-star Lily Serna shared several photos to Instagram of their recent catch-up in the countryside.

Lily's photos showed Richard looking far more casual and relaxed than he did during his days hosting the ABC's 7pm news broadcast from 1983 to 2002.

No longer clean shaven, he now sports grey hair and a beard, and also prefers jeans and checkered shirts to his usual dapper suit.

After leaving the ABC in 2002, Richard returned to TV on a part-time basis eight years later to host game show Letters and Numbers on SBS alongside mathematician Lily and dictionary expert David Astle.

The program was axed in 2012, but repeats are still aired on the network to this day.

Richard spoke to the ABC in 2017 about his decision to leave behind city life and relocate to bushland with his partner, Alison Mackay.

He said of the sea change: 'I guess we made a deal with each other where if we'd got to the point where I'd done the television news presenting for 20 years continuously, that seemed like a good milestone to make a big change in life.

'We did a bit of planning before that arrived, but when I got to the 20-year mark in 2002, we'd bought some acres of land near Jervis Bay and we made the jump. 

TV fixture: The newsman began his career as an ABC announcer in Adelaide in 1979, but is best known for being the host of ABC News Sydney's nightly bulletin from 1983 to 2002

'It wasn't a case of retiring, it was a case of seeing if we could live and work in a different way some distance from Sydney. That's how it has been for the past 15 years and it's been a fantastic contrast. It's a different and exciting way to live.'

Richard and Alison have worked hard to regenerate the 30 acres on which they live, and now oversee a property rich with wildlife.
