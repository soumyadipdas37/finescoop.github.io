Everton have been offered the chance to sign Napoli forward Arkadiusz Milik but much depends on whether Moise Kean returns to Juventus. 

Carlo Ancelotti's priority though is upgrading his defence as he is keen on signing a centre back. 

But is still keen on a forward and Juventus want to bring Kean back to the club after the striker endured a difficult first season at Everton.

Everton have been offered the chance to sign Napoli forward Arkadiusz Milik this summer

Carlo Ancelotti's priority is upgrading his defence as he is keen on signing a centre back

The 20-year-old signed for the Toffees last summer in a £25million deal but struggled to make an impact.

Italy international Kean has started just six Premier League matches and scored only two goals. 

The low point was reached when interim manager Duncan Ferguson substituted him just 19 minutes after bringing him on against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

But much depends on whether Moise Kean returns to Juventus who Everton bought him from

However, according to goal.com, former club Juventus want to offer Kean an escape route and get his career back on track. 

They report that the Italian champions wish to sign Kean on loan without an obligation to buy.
