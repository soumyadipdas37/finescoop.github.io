Rapper Iggy Azalea is celebrating nine years since the release of her first mixtape, Ignorant Art.

And the Australian rapper, 30, marked the special milestone on Sunday as she reflected on her humble beginnings on Twitter.

She tweeted: 'Can't believe nine years ago to this day I officially dropped my first project.'

'Feels like a lifetime ago': Iggy Azalea celebrated the 9th anniversary since the release of her first mixtape Ignorant Art

Iggy added: 'Feels like a lifetime ago and a flash at the same time. Here's something new in celebration to still being here!'

She also shared the album art for her 2011 mixtape, as well as a teaser for her new song High Maintenance from her upcoming third album, End of an Era.

Fans praised Iggy for how far she'd come in her career. 

 'This is insane. I'm so happy to see that you've come this far. We are proud of the great artist you have become,' one supporter wrote. 

Early days: In a tweet on Sunday, she shared the album art for her 2011 mixtape and wrote, 'Can't believe 9 years ago to this day I officially dropped my first project'

Milestone moment: She also said, 'Feels like a life time ago and a flash at the same time. Here's something new in celebration to still being here!'

In 2012, she told Dazed that the artwork and title of Ignorant Art was a reference to New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

'I think he really just did whatever he wanted in a time and place when people tried to stereotype what a "black" artist should or should not be, or even what "good art" should be. He just did his own thing, and I love that,' she said.

Since recording Ignorant Art, Iggy has released two studio albums, The New Classic in 2014 and In My Defense in 2019. 

Her popular collaborations include Fancy ft. Charli XCX and Black Widow ft. Rita Ora.

Iggy's third album, End of an Era, is due later this year. Its lead single, Dance Like Nobody's Watching ft. Tinashe, came out last month.

Iggy, whose real name is Amethyst Kelly, announced the birth of her son Onyx in June. She shares the child with rapper boyfriend Playboi Carti, a.k.a. Jordan Carter. 

'I have a son,' she wrote on Instagram Stories. 'I kept waiting for the right time to say something but it feels like the more time passes the more I realise I'm always going to feel anxious to share news that giant with the world.

'I want to keep his life private but wanted to make it clear he is not a secret and I love him beyond words.'
