Paris Hilton has claimed she felt 'pressured' into making her sex tape with her 'first real boyfriend' Rick Salomon.

In her upcoming documentary This Is Paris, the socialite, 39, compared the ordeal to being 'electronically raped' and admitted she wasn't 'in the right head space' after the video leaked online.

Filmed at the height of their relationship in 2001, the home-made movie was subsequently sold by poker player Rick, 52, following their separation in 2004 and distributed with the title 1 Night In Paris.

According to The Sun, the media personality reflected: 'It was my first real relationship. Eighteen. I was so in love with him and I wanted to make him happy. 

'And I just remember him pulling out the camera. And he was kind of pressuring me into it. It was like being electronically raped.'

Sharing her thoughts on whether the outcome would have been the same if the tape was released today, the heiress added: 'That was a private moment of a teenage girl, not in her right head space, but everyone was watching it and laughing like it's something funny.

On and off: The New Jersey native went onto marry model Pamela Anderson twice, between the years of 2007 and 2008, and 2014 and 2015 (pictured in 2014)

'If that happened today, it would not be the same story at all, but they made me the bad person. I did something bad...I was just so lost and desperate for love that I found the worst possible person.'

The Simple Life star echoed her comments in a recent interview with The Allbright as she said: 'I would say that the tape is something that I will regret for the rest of my life. I was a teenager; I was in love. I trusted the wrong person. And I let that happen. 

'I think a lot of young girls - especially when you're in a relationship - just want that love so bad and you trust that they're going to keep something private, but you never know what's going to happen, because people change, and some guys are not good people.'

Traumatic: Elsewhere in the documentary, the reality star discussed the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah (pictured in 2000)

Elsewhere in the documentary, the reality star discussed the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah, and experiencing 'multiple' abusive relationships.

Paris' wealthy parents Kathy and Richard sent her to many boarding schools following a rebellious phase after living at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City with her family. 

Paris spent 11 months at Provo Canyon School, the last in a series of institutions which focuses on behavioural and mental development.

The DJ - who revealed she was placed in solitary confinement after attempting to flee the education centre - recalled to People: 'I buried my truth for so long.  

'But I’m proud of the strong woman I’ve become. People might assume everything in my life came easy to me, but I want to show the world who I truly am.' 

Between 2011 and 2014, police responded to 56 calls for assault at Provo and 25 for sexual offences.  

The Stars Are Blind artist - who left the school in 1999 after she turned 18 - elaborated: 'I was so grateful to be out of there, I didn’t even want to bring it up again. It was just something I was ashamed of and I didn’t want to speak of it.'   

In a statement to People, the boarding school said: 'Originally opened in 1971, Provo Canyon School was sold by its previous ownership in August 2000.

'We therefore cannot comment on the operations or patient experience prior to this time.' MailOnline has contacted Provo Canyon School for further comment.

Due to her traumatic experience, she also admitted to 'normalising' abuse when it came to her romances, adding: 'I had become so used to it at Provo, that it made me feel like it was normal.' 

Nowadays, Paris is in a 'safe' and healthy relationship with entrepreneur Carter Reum, who she has been dating for nine months.

On their blossoming romance, the businesswoman recently said in a separate interview: 'I feel so safe with him. Before, I don't think I was really ready for a good relationship. But I've learned so much. And I'm so grateful to have found my perfect match.'

This Is Paris is set for release on YouTube on September 14.

Paris Hilton spoke at all-female members club, The AllBright digital event series about female resilience and entrepreneurship.
