If your hair is looking dry, damaged and generally unhappy, then incorporating a hair mask to your routine could be a real life-saver- especially after years of dyeing, straightening, highlighting, or bleaching.

While in-salon treatments can give a new lease of life to hair, they often come with a hefty price tag. If you're looking for a way to transform your hair from home then the Pantene Hair Mask Repair and Protect is a super cheap and cheerful solution.

You can now get wonderfully soft, shiny and swish-able tresses for next to nothing as the Pantene Hair Mask is now just £2 on Amazon- and shoppers can't get enough. 

If you're looking for a hair mask for dry and damaged hair then you can't go wrong with the Pantene Hair Mask Repair and Protect, priced at only £2 

Two minutes is all the time Pantene Hair Mask Repair and Protect needs to work its magic. Slather on to your locks and let the intensive treatment get to work, reversing the signs of damage caused by styling for visibly healthier-looking hair. 

Amazon shoppers have piled on the praise for the budget hair mask, raving about how it 'adds a lovely shine' and 'leaves your hair feeling and smelling like you've just left the salon'. In fact, 78 per cent have left glowing five-star reviews so for only £2, it's well-worth seeing what the fuss is about. 

Not only does the £2 hair mask have an irresistible scent, thanks to the Pro-V Nutrient Blend, the mask is full of ingredients that will actually repair hair. 

The micro-nourishers help lock in moisture deep down in strands transforming distressed, damaged hair. After just one use shoppers have reported that their hair is visibly smoother, softer and shinier. 

'My hair is extremely damaged after bleaching, and so I was looking around for something that could restore some strength and softness. Today is the first day I used it, and I'm already blown away with the improvement it's made.'  

To use, just slather it on to damp hair beginning from the tips and massaging upwards. Leave it to work for two minutes and then rinse thoroughly. 

The mask provides smoothness and shine for your damaged hair, even after just one use

The Pantene hair mask is especially popular with those with bleached or frequently styled hair. Not only does the mask improve the look of frazzled hair it is the perfect treatment to help strengthen and protect strands.  

One delighted shopper raved: 'Absolutely fantastic value. My hair is the best it has been for over 10 years from having bleached highlights and excessive use of heated products. Not only is my hair now, soft, shiny and light, but it smells absolutely amazing. I am definitely ordering again.'

Another wrote: 'This is so so great. My hair was very dry due to hard water and this product completely changed it! My hair is super conditioned now, shiny and smooth. I cannot recommend enough!'.

A third commented: 'Love this product so much, have used it about 4 times now but my hair felt and looked healthy just from the first use, it smells amazing and is a good size, will be buying again in the future.'
