A 12-year-old boy carrying a Donald Trump sign said he was punched in the back of the head and scratched by a woman on a moped, and police are now searching for the assailant. 

The boy said he was riding his bike with a yard sign supporting Trump on Monday around 3pm at Folsom Street and Glenwood Drive in Boulder, Colorado when he was attacked.

A woman riding a moped passed by and saw the sign and turned back around to confront him, Boulder police said.

The suspect drove up to the boy and said something to the effect of 'you want something to look at'.

A woman riding a moped passed by and saw the sign and turned back around to confront him, Boulder police said. She said something to the effect of 'you want something to look at'

She then punched him in the back of the head and arms four to five times and scratched him, according to police spokeswoman Shannon Aulabaugh.

She tried to snatch the sign but was unsuccessful and left the scene, according to the Denver Post.

The suspect is described as a white female in her 20s or 30s wearing a tan jacket, a blue shirt and blue jeans. She was riding a gray or blue moped.

The case is under investigation and no arrests or citations have been made. 

The boy said it wasn’t the first time he’s been attacked for showing support for Trump, but it’s the first time he had been attacked by an adult, according to the Denver Channel.

The incident took place on Monday around 3pm at Folsom Street and Glenwood Drive in Boulder

The boy said he's now apprehensive to show his support for Trump. He said: 'Just don’t attack people ‘cause what she did to me – that’s not okay'

He said he was holding the sign between his arms as he was riding his bike and the woman 'just looked at me and laughed' when she initially passed him.

'I like showing what I believe in. I didn’t want any conflict – I just wanted to show what I believe in,' the boy said.
