Three English nationals are being investigated over the death of a British woman who was killed when she was hit by a speedboat while swimming off a Corfu beach yesterday.  

Claire Glatman, 60, the wife of multimillionaire property tycoon Mark Glatman, was killed when she was hit by a speedboat while swimming in the sea off Avlaki beach, Corfu. 

Her body was discovered by another bather at around 10am. 

Three English nationals aged between 20 and 30, two of whom have holiday homes on the island, are being investigated in relation to Mrs Glatman's death, local media reported. 

The speedboat thought to have been involved in the incident was found abandoned at a nearby beach and has been moved to a local marina while port authorities carry out a forensic investigation.  

Mrs Glatman was from Bedale in North Yorkshire and was on holiday with Mark, 63, and the eldest of her two daughters, who have been informed of her death. She also has two sons.

This boat is suspected of being the one involved in yesterday's tragic incident on Avlaki beach 60-year-old Mrs Glatman was fatally injured

Claire Glatman, 60, was the wife of multimillionaire property tycoon, Mark Glatman, 63, pictured above 

Her body was pulled from the sea shortly before 10am and taken to Corfu General Hospital. The family's lawyer identified the body of the 60-year-old at noon yesterday.  

Coroner Ioannis Aivatidis said Mrs Glatman suffered multiple injuries to her left wrist, arm, chest, pelvis and upper right leg, leading to internal and external haemorrhaging.   

Aivatidis added that Mrs Glatman was hit hard by the speedboat, and died after just a few moments. 

The wounds were so severe, he said, that no attempt to resuscitate her would have worked had someone managed to get her out of the water.

She was described as a resident of Corfu for most of the year who was 'very popular in the local community', according to public broadcaster ERT. 

Mrs Glatman is said to have fallen in love with Mr Glatman on the island 30 years ago and the couple purchased a villa more recently, where they spend a portion of the year, the Telegraph reported. 

A friend who chose to remain anonymous told the Telegraph that Mrs Glatman was an experienced swimmer. 

Corfu Press reported, citing friends of the family, that Mrs Glatman swam at the spot every day while on the island. 

Mr Glatman is chief executive of a British national commercial property group called Abstract.  

A coastguard spokesman told the Telegraph: 'We received an emergency call by local swimmers who found the woman's body floating in the sea.

'The coastguard recovered the body and transferred it to the local state hospital where an autopsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of her death.'  

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'We are in contact with the local authorities following reports that a British woman has died in Corfu.' 

Villagers in the Mrs Glatman's home village of Well, in North Yorkshire, were shocked at the death of the 'beautiful soul'.

 Claire and her husband Mark lived in the historic Well Hall, in the heart of the village. 

The extensive walled property has a swimming pool and tennis courts. A neighbour of Claire said: 'It is dreadful news. She loved Corfu and they spent a lot of time there, but she was also a popular person around Well. 

'I knew her as a beautiful soul, friendly and very young at heart.' 

Another villager said: 'We have had a scarecrow festival this weekend gone and the whole village came together and we had a fantastic time, but this has really brought us back down to earth. 

'What a horrible thing to happen. My thoughts are with Mark and the rest of the family.' 

UK tourists have been returning to Greece in recent weeks after travel restrictions were lifted. 

Greece is one of the 'travel corridor' countries where tourists can go without having to quarantine for two weeks when they return to Britain. 

However, an increase in coronavirus cases in recent weeks has pushed it closer to the threshold of 20 cases per 100,000 in a week at which the UK is likely to re-impose quarantine rules. 

The current figure is 14.1, after nearly 1,500 new cases were reported in the last seven days.   

Greece needs tourism to revive an economy still grappling with the aftermath of a depression that wiped out a quarter of its economy. 

New local restrictions have been imposed in tourist hotspots such as Mykonos to curb the spread of the virus, including a midnight curfew for bars, restaurants and cafes and a ban on large gatherings.
