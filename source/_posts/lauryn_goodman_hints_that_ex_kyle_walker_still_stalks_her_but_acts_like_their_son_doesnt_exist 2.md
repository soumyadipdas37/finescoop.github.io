Lauryn and Kyle struck up a brief romance with after he split from his partner of 10 years, Annie Kilner but they have since reconciled and are now engaged.

After much fanfare when her pregnancy came to light, including anger from Annie, Lauryn admitted she 'has a lot to explain' to Junior.  

In a recent Instagram Q&A, she wrote: 'I think it's important for Junior to have privacy given the circumstances. He's super important to me and I don't want to affect his mental health in the future...

'He's already got to deal with a lot which I'll have to explain to him when he can understand so I need to protect him as best I can. He's my main priority'.

When she was asked about life as a single mother, she penned: 'Honestly, being a single mother is nothing to be ashamed of. Yes it's hard. But nothing in life worth having is easy. You'll be stronger for it. 

'You get to decide everything. TBH it's amazing just hard work! But like they say double the love and reward. Always remember YOU by yourself grew your baby it was all YOU!' 

The Q&A came hours after Lauryn revealed she had finally named her son - four months after welcoming the tot with footballer Kyle.

Taking to Instagram earlier this month, the model confirmed his name and gushed over the tot alongside an image showing her cradling Junior. 

Despite giving an interview in Closer Magazine in which she claimed the baby did not have a name, just hours after its release she took to Instagram to share a snap with the tot and simply added the words 'Meet Junior'. 

Revealing her baby's gender for the first time, she said: 'I haven't settled on a name yet. There are two names I absolutely love, but I just need to decide which way round I would prefer his name to be.

'I haven't registered him yet, (the government are allowing extra time to register a child during the Covid: 19 pandemic) so I have a bit of time to decide.'

She has now however posted the introduction post to Junior and subsequently a lengthy and gushing post about her baby son. 

Enamoured: Lauryn said she found out she was five months pregnant during a routine kidney scan and that she and Kyle found out the gender straight away, but kept the news private
