Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert chose Irena Srbinovska as his leading lady on Thursday's finale episode of The Bachelor, after professing to have fallen in love with her.

And just a day later, it appeared three was not a crowd, when the lovebirds caught up for drinks with eliminated contestant Bel Colwell in Sydney's Paddington. 

Irena, 31, walked hand-in-hand with Bel, 25, as Locky, 31, smiled behind them.

Irena showed off her leggy figure in a leopard print frock and black mule heels.

The nurse accessorised with a black leather jacket, and styled her brunette locks out, framing an elegant makeup palette.

Irena could not wipe the smile off her face on the leisurely night with Locky and Bel.

Looking good: Irena showed off her leggy figure in a leopard print dress and black mule heels. She accessorised with a black leather jacket 

Gentleman: Locky carried the girls' handbags, allowing them to catch up freely 

Bel opted for a green floral print wrap top, that revealed her delicate décolletage, teamed with a gold silk skirt and black pointy-toe heels.

The blonde beauty allowed her wavy locks to flow in the breeze, and kept her makeup fresh and natural. 

Locky appeared all too happy to carry the girls' handbags, allowing them to catch up freely in front.

Sweet gesture: Locky, who cut a suave figure on the night, gave Irena his grey suit jacket to wear

Proud: Locky pointed to a sign that read 'school of nursing' in a nod to Irena's chosen career path. The pair locked lips 

Smitten: Locky had no qualms in packing on the PDA with Irena, warmly embracing her and gazing adoringly into her eyes 

The former Australian Survivor star cut a suave figure in a crisp white dress shirt, navy slim-fit pants, a grey suit jacket and pristine white sneakers.

During the night, Locky managed to steal Irena away for a quick moment, locking lips in an inner city street.

Ever the gentleman, he ensured Irena was kept warm, with the beauty seen sporting his grey suit jacket. 

On Thursday, a conflicted Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale. 

See that? Locky could not wipe the smile off his face during the outing 

'I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you': Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant on Thursday's finale episode of The Bachelor

'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.

'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.' 

Moments earlier, he'd delivered the bad news to runner-up Bella Varelis - despite having told her beforehand that he was 'falling in love' with her.
