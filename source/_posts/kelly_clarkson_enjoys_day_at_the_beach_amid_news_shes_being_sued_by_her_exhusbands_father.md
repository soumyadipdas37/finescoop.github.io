Kelly Clarkson took some time to get her mind off of her family drama and spent a day off at the at the beach in Los Angeles on Sunday.

Her respite was unfortunately short lived, however, as just two days later she was sued for $1.4 million by her longtime management company which is run by the family of her soon-to-be ex-husband Brandon Blackstock. 

On Tuesday, Narvel Blackstock's Starstruck Management Group filed a claim against the 38-year-old accusing her of not paying them their 'full commission' for her work on The Voice and The Kelly Clarkson Show this year, according to Variety.

However, over the weekend the Grammy-winner seemed carefree as she hung out with friends and took a dip in the Pacific.

Kelly was spotted wearing a classic black one-piece swimsuit with a plunging V-neck underneath a trendy black cotton romper.

Her dirty blonde hair was swept up in a chic messy bun on the top of her head and she was all-smiles walking on the sand.

Trouble brewing: On Tuesday, Narvel Blackstock's Starstruck Management Group filed a claim against the 38-year-old accusing her of not paying them their 'full commission' for her work on The Voice and The Kelly Clarkson Show this year, according to Variety 

Background: Clarkson is currently in the midst of divorcing her husband of seven years, Brandon Blackstock - who has also served as her manager during that time

She was surrounded by a gaggle of girlfriends during her seaside outing and the group was seen chatting together in the surf. 

Clarkson is currently in the midst of divorcing her husband of seven years, Brandon Blackstock - who has also served as her manager during that time. Before Brandon, Kelly was managed by his dad Narvel.  

Narvel's management company sued Kelly this week claiming that she has paid his firm $1.9 million in 2020 but still owes them an additional $1.4 - adding that she will allegedly owe them around $5.4 million by the years end. 

'Over the course of approximately 13 years, Starstruck developed Clarkson into a mega superstar,' the complaint read in part. 'By way of example only, Starstruck was instrumental in helping Clarkson achieve success in terms of numerous hit albums, multiple Grammy wins and nominations, her role on popular television shows like The Voice and her own talk show. 

'Over the course of approximately 13 years, Starstruck developed Clarkson into a mega superstar,' the complaint read in part. 'Despite Starstruck's hard work and dedication, Clarkson has decided she is going to stop paying Starstruck for what is contractually owed.'
