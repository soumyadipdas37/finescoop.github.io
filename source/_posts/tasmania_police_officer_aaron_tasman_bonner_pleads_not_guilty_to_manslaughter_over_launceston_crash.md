A Tasmanian police officer has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter over a car crash which killed a NSW tourist who was walking with his wife.

He was allegedly on duty and driving a police car when it collided with another car causing it to flip and spin, and hit the couple.

The man, aged in his 40s, died at the scene while his wife was flown to Melbourne with serious injuries.

Bonner entered a plea of not guilty to a charge of manslaughter on Thursday in Launceston Magistrates Court.

He also pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm.

He will appear in the Launceston Supreme Court on November 16.

Bonner is yet to enter pleas to charges of causing the death of another person by negligent driving and causing grievous bodily harm to another person by negligent driving. The matters have been adjourned indefinitely.
