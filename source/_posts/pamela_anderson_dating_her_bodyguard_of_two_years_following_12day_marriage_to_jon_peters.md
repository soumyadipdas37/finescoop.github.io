Pamela Anderson has reportedly found love with her bodyguard.

The star's friends claim her new romance is the 'the pandemic's sexiest tryst,' according to Page Six, which reported the relationship on Friday.

The bodyguard has been working for Pamela, 53, for nearly two years, but only recently have things turned romantic.

Sources wouldn't name him, but they insisted he is a good match for Pamela.   

'He's in his 40s. A real man, finally,' the source says. 'He knows how to handle her. It's very cool to see. She's completely comfortable, and they're never out of each other's sight.'

Pamela is the first celebrity the bodyguard has worked for, and sources believe this makes the romance even better for her.

'He's not a Hollywood insider,' the insider said. 'That's perfect for Pamela.'

The couple are already exclusive and have been 'camping out' at upscale hotels in Canada.

'Security #whereswaldo,' she captioned the image, along with a pink flower and cat with heart eyes emoji.

The relationship comes eight months following her 12-day marriage to Hollywood producer Jon Peters.

In an interview with the New York Times following the marriage, Pamela insisted she wasn't married. 

'There was no wedding, there was no marriage, there was no anything.'

Despite her checkered history with marriage, the Baywatch babe declared she was keen to tie the knot again.   

'Just one more time, please, God. One more time only,' she declared.

Pamela described what happened with Jon as 'just kind of a little moment.'

'I was in India and I went to this panchakarma cleanse, and I'd been gone for three weeks in this ayurvedic center, meditating, just so clear,' the pinup explained.

'I came back and VWOOM, within 24 hours, I saw Jon. It was like this little whirlwind thing, and it was over really quick, and it was nothing. Nothing physical. It's just a friendship,' she said.

Happier times: She was also married to poker player Rick Salomon from 2007 to 2008

The duo had known each other for 30 years prior to their marriage, and Pamela said there were 'no hearts were broken' during their 'moment'.

The marriage ended amid allegations Pamela ended the marriage after Jon paid off nearly $200k of her debt, while other sources accused the producer of attempting to 'control' her career, according to Page Six. 

Both parties have denied these allegations.  

Including her union with Jon, Pamela has been married a total of four times. 

She was married to Tommy Lee from 1995 to 1998, Kid Rock from 2006 to 2007, and Rick Salomon from 2007 to 2008.
