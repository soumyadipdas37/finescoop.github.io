Changing times: Mandy took to her Instagram stories to reveal all the new protocols the production has put in place on her first day back on set  

Due to the virus many productions have instituted the use of mannequins for on-set love scenes, with some even utilizing actors' spouses as stand-ins.  

The director's chairs, which usually are lined up next to each other off camera, are now separated by plexiglass as each actor has their own stall for safety. 

Within the chambers, which Milo playfully dubbed 'Shower stalls A and B', each actor is given a container of sanitized props. 

The onset couple waived and talked to each other through the glass as they marveled at how different set life felt these days.
