She recently came out in defense of her newly unveiled SKIMS Maternity line, after keyboard warriors accused her of attempting to mask pregnant women's bodies. 

But Kim Kardashian shook off the drama by uploading a sweet snapshot of herself, longtime friend, La La Anthony, 39, and singer Monica Denise, 39, to Instagram on Sunday.

The 39-year-old KUWTK star cut a casual figure in a tight fitting cotton bodysuit and a pair of drawstring trousers.

Kim's brunette hair was styled into a chic half up, half down 'do, which is a go-to look for her younger sister Kylie Jenner, 23.

She enhanced her enviable features with a generous amount of bronzer, a few swipes of mascara, and a bit of her favorite neutral nude lipstick.

Kim, La La, and Monica struck their fiercest poses outdoors, while sitting on some concrete steps.

La La and Monica reposted Kim's snapshot onto their individual Instagram Stories with the caption: 'Teamwork.'

Kardashian and Anthony, who often document their friendship on social media, have been in each other's lives for over a decade.

In an interview with Us Weekly last year, the former MTV VJ described the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan as 'incredible' and said that 'they've all been [her] friends for 10-plus years.' 

Monica recently joined Kim's prison reform agenda, particularly regarding the release of rapper and friend Corey 'C-Murder' Miller. 

Corey is currently serving a life sentence for a tragic murder that occurred at a nightclub in 2002.

Lending her voice: 'The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted,' explained Kim in a string of tweets shared in August

'The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted,' explained Kim in a string of tweets shared in August. 

She added that, since Corey's conviction, 'witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict'  

'Today I’m teaming up with @MonicaDenise, @JessicaJackson and @EdyHaney to #FreeCoreyMiller,' concluded the KKW Beauty founder.

After sharing the sweet photo with Monica and La La, Kardashian returned to her Instagram to show off a custom clothing label that she noticed in one of her Heavy Manners pieces.

'LOL @heavymanners,' wrote Kim, in reference to brand referring to the size of the garment as 'Kim Kardashian West' size.

Kim Kardashian's brand-new maternity line from her shape wear brand Skims immediately sparked controversy on social media over the weekend. 

But the reality star defended her new garments online Sunday, denying accusations the line was pressuring pregnant woman to mask their natural figures while explaining how the solutionwear actually helps support expecting bodies.

'To anyone who has an issue with maternity solutionwear, and if you haven't been pregnant before you may not know the struggle of what it's like carrying all of this extra weight the way I did with millions of strong women,' she wrote in a lengthy Instagram Story.

She clarified the specific line, tailored for expectant mothers, 'is not to slim, but to support.' 

'It provides support to help with the uncomfortable weight being carried in your stomach which affects your lower back - and the compression on the leggings help with pain relief caused by swelling.'
