Musical power couple Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton have reportedly spent far too much time together in quarantine confined at his 1,382-acre 10 Point Ranch in Tishomingo in his native Oklahoma.

'They feel suffocated and stressed,' a source told Us Weekly on Wednesday. 'They're both stretched to the limit.'

The 50-year-old Orange County Girl and the 44-year-old country crooner are said to be tense over moving to the $13.2M mansion in LA's Encino neighborhood, which they bought back in May.

'Friends say this move has turned into a nightmare,' the insider added. 'This is the toughest period they've had so far without a doubt.'

Last Sunday, Blake tweeted a throwback red carpet snap and joked that he should bring back his long leather jacket and long hair when he attends the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards on Wednesday night.

Shelton is scheduled to perform his track Happy Anywhere featuring Stefani at the ceremony at an undisclosed location.

'Y'all think I should bring back this look?' Last Sunday, Blake tweeted a throwback red carpet snap and joked that he should bring back his long leather jacket and long hair when he attends the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards on Wednesday night

It's the inseparable pair's fourth duet after Nobody But You in 2020, Go Ahead And Break My Heart in 2016, and You Make It Feel Like Christmas in 2017.

Coincidentally, the eight-time Grammy nominee's ex-wife #2 Miranda Lambert will also be performing during the CBS broadcast - singing Bluebird with Natalie Hemby and Luke Dick at The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville.

And Blake already lost one of his three ACM Award nominations - Music Event Of The Year - which went to the 36-year-old Grammy winner for her collaboration with five others, Fooled Around and Fell in Love.
