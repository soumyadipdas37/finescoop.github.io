Denim is one of the true loves of our lives.

How can you NOT be a little besotted with this timeless look? 

From jeans to shirts to dresses to shorts and everything in between, it's the most versatile and easy to style look out there. 

If you're feeling a bit jaded, however, and are lacking inspiration for how to rock your denim in new and gorgeous ways, then never fear.

We've found some seriously good denim outfits on some seriously stylish celebrities. 

Check them out below and then recreate the looks this season.

Which dreamy denim is your favourite? Let us know in the comments below. 

1. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's grown up denim

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley does grown up denim 3 ways

It goes without saying that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley would look amazing in anything, but she really does look great in jeans.

The British model has a grown up approach to denim and always makes it look elegant and sophisticated.

She tends to opt for skinny or slim leg styles and invariably wears them with a heel. We love the knee high boots and faux fur coat look, ideal for autumn and winter and note how she dresses the denim up with a silk blouse, some cool shades or a tailored blazer.

So much to learn here. Thank you Rosie. 

2. The Hadid sisters' perfect transitional denim looks

Bella and Gigi Hadid have nailed the perfect transitional denim looks

The Hadid sisters are two of the hottest models in the world and they're also styled to perfection pretty much every time they step out of the door. 

We chose these looks from the siblings because they're the perfect outfits for this transitional time between seasons.

Bella introduces some colourful knitwear (LOVE a cardigan) to proceedings but keeps it lightweight and unbuttoned, worn over only her lingerie. 

And Gigi demonstrates some clever layering for those chillier autumn days, styling her ripped, loose fitting jeans with a polo neck top and an open shirt.  

We'll be doing both of these looks ASAP. 

3. Priyanka Chopra's tailored denim

Priyanka Chopra shows off her stems in some tailored denim

Denim isn't just about jeans, of course, and Priyanka Chopra is showing us just how fab a denim mini skirt can be.

In fact, this whole ensemble is a great example of a more tailored take on the trend. 

A denim mini looks gorgeous in the summer with bare legs, but as the temperature drops looks just as cool with a pair of opaque black tights, so don't pack yours away just yet. 

And don't be afraid of doing double denim either. Priyanka's belted jacket makes her look into a suit and with those bright yellow mules, she's giving us fashion palpitations. 

4. Diane Kruger's signature denim look

Diane Kruger's signature denim look

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Diane Kruger is well aware of the appeal of a French take on denim. And it's an aesthetic she rocks time and again. 

She starts with some retro inspired jeans, adds a striped Breton top, a jacket, sunglasses and finally a hat. And it all comes together to form the most perfect insouciant, effortless off-duty look.   

We're learning from the best here people.

5. Kaia Gerber's cold weather denim

Kaia Gerber's cold weather denim

Anyone looking for winter denim inspiration should check out Kaia Gerber. 

Straight leg jeans. Check. Chunky cable knit sweater. Check. Leather coat. Check. Beanie hat. Check.

This is the a foolproof cold day, casual look and one we'll probably be reaching for sooner rather than later.  

You see. The teenagers can teach us a lot.

6. Kendall Jenner's colourful denim

Kendall Jenner's colourful denim

Listen, we're definitely blue jean babies, but sometimes a girl's got to mix things up.

And that's just what Kendall Jenner did in this super bright, red denim ensemble. 

We've got plenty of mid-wash, bleached, black and even pink denim hanging in our wardrobes but now we're inspired to take things up another notch or two.

And to wear it head to toe like Ms Jenner. 

Loving the patent Dr Martens too...

7. Elsa Hosk's glamazon take on denim

Elsa Hosk's glamazon take on denim

As Priyanka Chopra has already demonstrated, denim is more than just jeans.

And now Elsa Hosk is taking that notion and running with it. Plus, making it ultra sexy while she's at it. 

Even denim dungarees can't fail to look alluring on Elsa. This pair fits her incredible figure like a glove, while that denim mini dress is killer too. 

With a bandeau neckline and waist-accentuating button details, this look would be great for a date night or an evening out on the town. 

Supermodel stems sadly not included.

8. Kate Hudson's vintage inspired denim 

Kate Hudson's vintage inspired denim

Kate Hudson has always been one of our favourites.

She just seems really cool, really fun and we just wish we could be in her girl gang.

Kate is a fan of a hippy-ish look. Something a little vintage and a lot California. 

And the actress discovered long ago the power of the flare. While the rest of the world was obsessing over skinnies, Kate knew that flared jeans were where it was at. 

If you haven't tried them yet then now is the time. We guarantee you'll fall head over heels with their ability to elongate the legs and shape the rear. Style like Kate with silk blouses and contrasting textures like corduroy.   

And why not embrace the late 60s with a pair of platform heels too? 

You can never have enough denim.

So treat yourself to some new threads and why not recreate these gorgeous denim looks this season? 

 Grown up denim

L-R: Mint Velvet Relaxed Boyfriend Blazer (£110), V by Very Premium High Waist Skinny Jean (£30) and Monsoon Suede Long Slouch Boots (£100) all at Very

Smarten up in a tailored blazer like this one by Mint Velvet and wear it with classic skinny jeans tucked into some new season knee high boots by Monsoon. 

This is dapper denim ladies and we're into it.

Transitional denim

L-R: V by Very Button Up Short Cardigan with Pockets (£25), V by Very Premium High Waist 90s Full Length Jean (£32) and Public Desire Pheonix Ankle Boot (£40) all at Very

Bridge the gap between seasons with some well chosen knitwear. 

These 90s style straight leg jeans will look awesome with a bright, slightly cropped cardigan. Wear it over nothing but a bra and leave the bottom button undone to show a flash of midriff. 

White ankle boots by Public Desire complete the look. 

French Dressing

L-R: Accessorize Cord Mariner Cap (£18), Superdry Edit Cruise Top (£30) and Ted Baker Mina Round Sunglasses (£95) all at Very

Nail the 'didn't try too hard' look by styling your favourite jeans with a striped Breton top by Superdry, some round sunglasses and a cute cord mariner's cap. 

Parisian perfection!

Denim alternatives 

L-R: V by Very Long Sleeve Zip Through Denim Jumpsuit (£48), V by Very Puff Sleeve Denim Dress (£35) and Monsoon Kora Denim Pelmet Skirt (£45) all at Very

Develop your love of denim into something even more long-lasting by expanding its dominion over your wardrobe.

A denim boilersuit is such an easy to look to just throw on. Wear with sneakers and layer over a polo neck when the weather takes a turn for the worse. 

And a denim mini dress will look fab whether you're back at the office or out with the girls. Wear with tights if you're ready to put your legs away for a few months.

And the same goes for rocking a denim mini skirt this season. Add knee high boots and an oversized chunky knit for a look that will be comfy and cosy but is guaranteed to turn heads too.

Vintage inspired denim

L-R: Mint Velvet Hattie Print Blouse (£70) and Superdry High Rise Skinny Flare Jeans (£55) both at Very

Take a step back in time in this pair of sleek and ultra flattering flares by Superdry. You'll be amazed by how tall you feel.

And work them with a silky printed blouse like this one by Mint Velvet.

So there you go. Denim looks for days!
