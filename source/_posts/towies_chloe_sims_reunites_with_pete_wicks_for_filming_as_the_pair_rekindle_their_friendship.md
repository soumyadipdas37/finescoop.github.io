She has reconnected with her old friend Pete Wicks after they had a falling out in January and did not speak for eight months.

And Chloe Sims looked sensational as she reunited with Pete for filming the new series of TOWIE in Essex on Monday.  

The reality star, 37, donned a black top and a pair of leather trousers for the day and she was also joined by her younger sisters Frankie, 24, and Demi Sims, 23.

Reunited: Chloe Sims, 37, and Pete Wicks, 31, have seemingly put their feud behind them as they got together to film scenes for TOWIE on Monday 

Chloe added height to her frame with a pair of black boots and she also sported a matching leather jacket.

Carrying a black handbag, the beauty let her blonde lock fall loose down her shoulders for the day.

Pete donned a cream and black printed shirt along with a white vest top and a pair of black skinny jeans as he hung out with the Sims sisters.

Demi cut a trendy figure as she arrived for filming in a silver long-sleeved crop top with a daring plunging neckline.

Also wearing matching tracksuit bottoms, Demi wore a clear pair of heels and a silver necklace.

Frankie opted for an eye-catching black jumpsuit and added height to her frame with a pair of matching boots. 

The outing comes after Chloe and Pete finally had their first chat in eight months on Sunday's episode of TOWIE.

Things got a little heated as Chloe aired her grievances and explained to Pete why she has been unhappy with their friendship. 

Pete kicked off the awkward conversation by asking if there was 'anything' Chloe would like to say.

She replied: 'Not really, I don't wanna be rude in front of Peggy [Pete's dog], but you were a bit of an a***hole.

'Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings and … are you going to look at me or are you going to look at the bush?

'I feel like you were dismissing how I felt a lot, I've confided in you, I've told you everything and told you all my secrets... and I know I'm a lot.

'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change, I am who I am.'

Pete then tried to interject, telling Chloe to 'hold on, hold on', but to no avail as she continued to explain how she was feeling.

Fashion: Demi cut a trendy figure as she arrived for filming in a silver long-sleeved crop top with a daring plunging neckline 

She continued: 'No, I'm getting to my point. Obviously when the pandemic happened I just thought "omg I need Pete, I need to talk to Pete''.'

Pete then asked his former close pal, 'so why didn't ya?' with Chloe replying that she 'didn't know if you would be there even if I did reach out'.

During the interaction Pete appeared to be concentrating hard on what Chloe had to say about what went wrong between them.

Despite finally chatting about what the problem is, the pair did not reveal why they had fallen out in the first place in the clip.

Making up: Chloe and Pete are rebuilding their friendship after they went eight months without speaking

Drama: The outing comes after Chloe and Pete finally had their first chat in eight months on Sunday's episode of TOWIE 

In the previous week's episode, Chloe said of their feud: 'Me and Pete stopped speaking. We had a falling out since the end of January. It wasn't nasty, it was quite calm but I didn't want to have people around me who aren't 100%. I just said, "I can't have you in my life anymore."'

Later in the episode, Olivia Attwood met with Pete and took the opportunity to hear his side of the story.

Recalling their falling out, he said: 'We had a barney and the last thing she said to me was we didn't need to talk so, so be it.

Argument: Things got a little heated as Chloe aired her grievances and explained to Pete why she has been unhappy with their friendship, saying he had 'dismissed' her feelings

'We've been close for so many years and this was the first time we've disagreed and I've thought, 'you know what she doesn't want me in her life.' It's the longest we've ever gone without talking.'

Pete admitted he would like to patch things up with Chloe but he worries that their friendship was beyond repair.

He said: 'What does worry me, if I do reach out to her and she says f**k off, it'll hurt me. Do I want to save the friendship? Of course I do. Do I think it can be saved? No.'
