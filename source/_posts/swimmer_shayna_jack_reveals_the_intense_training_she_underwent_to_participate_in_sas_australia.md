Australian swimmer Shayna Jack is set to undertake a whole new challenge as she joins the cast of SAS Australia.

The military-style show will see stars put through their paces as they attempt to pass the selection process to join the Australian Army's elite Special Air Service.

And on Saturday, the 21-year-old detailed to Stellar magazine the intense preparation that she did before appearing on the show.

'I did as much as I could to prepare my body without causing injury, she said. 

'Bike rides to build endurance in my legs, pack walks to prepare for the long days with heavy equipment, and boxing to help with cardio,' she revealed 

Touching on the struggles she faced following her suspension from competitive swimming, Shayna thinks that she will be able to face the mental challenges the show brings.

'When it comes to my mentality, I believe the past year of mental battles was enough to prepare myself,' she added. 

The new Channel Seven series will see contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation and physical endurance. 

Disgraced ex-WAG Arabella Del Busso, publicist Roxy Jacenko, Candice Warner, Merrick Watts and Nick Cummins are also confirmed for the show.

Shayna came under fire when she tested positive to Ligandrol in both her A and B samples in Cairns in July, 2019, ahead of the FINA World Championships in South Korea. 

She has regularly protested her innocence and denied knowingly taking the drug.

'It's something that is so far-fetched from what I'd ever think would happen to me,' Shayna told The Sunday Project last year.
