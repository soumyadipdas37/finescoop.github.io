TV star Larry Emdur's daughter has had a restraining order taken out on her behalf by cops against her heavily-tattooed beach buddy. 

A Sydney court on Thursday heard that NSW Police have brought a provisional apprehended domestic violence order against Ms Emdur's one time friend Rickie Volpatti.   

Under the conditions of the order, Mr Volpatti is banned from approaching Ms Emdur in any way except via his lawyer.

Mr Volpatti may not go within 100 metres of where graphic designer Ms Emdur lives, works or a particular property in Bellevue Hill.

A court heard that Ms Emdur has given police a recorded statement known as a Domestic Violence Evidence in Chief or 'DVEC'

He has also been hit with standard AVO conditions preventing him from assaulting, threatening, stalking, harassing or intimidating her, or destroying her property.

Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting Mr Volpatti is alleged to have done any of that - and police have laid no charges against him.

A court heard that Ms Emdur has given police a recorded statement known as a Domestic Violence Evidence in Chief or 'DVEC' 

Such statements involve alleged victims telling their version of events, in their own words, for court.

The pair appear to have been mates - attending the beach together in a social media snap last summer - but one friend was unaware of any romance. 

A NSW Police Force spokesman said the matter relates to an apprehended domestic violence order application first made by police on May 7, 2020. 

The AVO was taken out on Ms Emdur's behalf at the end of July, court records said. On right, Mr Volpatti relaxes in a spa with a glass of red wine in a social media image

 

Social media profiles said Mr Volpatti was a member of the NSW Liberal Party and works for a landscaping company

A magistrate on Thursday granted an additional two weeks for the prosecution brief to be tendered to court, and a further two weeks for Mr Volpatti's defence.

Solicitor Kiran Sahota attended court on Mr Volpatti's behalf but neither of the parties appeared in court. 

After being approached for comment, Ms Emdur posting to Instagram that she was donating blood. 

'It's a good day to do some good,' she said.

Ms Emdur is the youngest of Morning Show host Larry's two children. She has an older brother, Jye.

The TV personality has described his daughter as one of his 'favourite people in the world'.

She has made headlines previously for buying a $1million property with her parents at just 19 years old.

It has been reported that she has aspirations to become a fashion designer. TV personality Larry hosted Seven's program as usual on Thursday. 

Mr Volpatti and his solicitor were approached for comment. 

The case continues at a later date.
