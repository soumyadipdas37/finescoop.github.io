 Pittsburgh Pirates star prospect Oneil Cruz has been arrested in the Dominican Republic after he was involved in a traffic accident which left three people dead - as prosecutors allege he was driving drunk.

Police say a preliminary investigation showed the 21-year-old was under the influence of alcohol when his SUV crashed into a motorbike, killing its three passengers. 

 Authorities have requested three months of preventive prison during the investigation in a motion before a virtual court hearing scheduled for Wednesday.

A police report indicated that Cruz was driving in Baní approximately at 1am Monday when he allegedly rear-ended the bike on the left lane of the Sanchez highway that connects Baní and San Cristóbal. 

Jons Sabab, 23; Daniela Pérez, 19; and Deby Beato, 20, were killed in the accident. 

Oneil Cruz, ranked as the third-best prospect in the Pittsburgh Pirates minor league system, was arrested in the Dominican Republic on Monday after he crashed into a motorcycle and killing its three passengers. Authorities have said that the 21-year-old was driving under the influence of alcohol

The Department of Transit Safety and Ground Transportation incident report indicated the motorcycle's lights were not turned on before Cruz crashed into in the Baní town of Los Mercaditos de Paya.

Cruz was apprehended at the scene of the accident. 

A woman, who identified herself as Beato's aunt, told Dominican television station Telesistema 11 that he was sleeping in his room when Sabab and Pérez picked him up at his home in the San Cristóbal town of Sabana Grande de Palenque. 

Sabab's mother told Telesistema 11 that her son and his two other friends had planned to travel to Baní for a night out.

All three died in a motorcycle accident

Peravia province prosecutors confirmed that Cruz and the victims had ignored the 9pm curfew set in place by the Dominican Republic government to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A resident who spoke to network alleged that Cruz had a habit of driving at an excessive speed throughout the streets of Baní.

'He has to pay because he was under the influence of alcohol'  the man said.

Cruz had been working out at the Pirates' alternative training site in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and returned to the Dominican Republic last week.

He hit .286 with eight home runs and stole 10 bases in 70 games while playing for Class A Advanced Bradenton and Class AA Altoona in 2019.

'The Pirates are aware of the tragic accident in the Dominican Republic involving Oneil Cruz,' Pirates senior vice president of communications Brian Warecki said in a statement Tuesday. 'We have been in contact with Oneil and he is cooperating fully with the local authorities. We will provide an update as more information becomes available.' 

Cruz could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted.
