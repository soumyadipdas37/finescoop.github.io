Just hours out from The Bachelor finale on Thursday, Channel 10 appears to have inadvertently given away the winner.

In posts on Instagram Stories, the network shared a series of seemingly unassuming photos of Locky Gilbert and his two finalists, Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska from the finale.

But a closer look reveals the 31-year-old Bachelor's pocket square is a perfect match with Irena's brown animal print dress.

The fabric used to create Locky's pocket square appears to have come from a cut off of Irena's sweeping floor-length gown, suggesting he picks the 31-year-old nurse.

The outgoing Bachelor even stuck to a similar colour palette as the Bachelor favourite, opting for a cream-coloured suit and white shirt.

Meanwhile, Bella, 25, is set to look equally glamorous in a strapless purple ball gown with a floor-length tulle skirt for the finale.

According to an article on Medium back in February 2018, it's common for men to try and match their partner with something like a pocket square: 'Nothing says you're together quite like coordinating outfits.' 

'The easiest and most noticeable way to match your date is to grab a colour from their ensemble and make it your pop of colour!' they added. 

'For example, if you see your partner is wearing a great salmon pink dress, add an upgraded pocket square to your look.'

Irena has been a favourite to win Locky's heart since the beginning of this year's season, with the handsome Bachelor regularly talking about their connection.

In an interview with the Herald Sun on Thursday, Irena confessed she'd be 'heartbroken' if Locky chose Bella, after falling hard for him.

'I have fallen head over heels crazy for Locky, I see him as my future partner, my husband, the father of my children,' she revealed.
