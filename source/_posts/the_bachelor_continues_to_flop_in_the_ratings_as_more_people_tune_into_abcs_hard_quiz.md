The Bachelor has continued to lag in the ratings with Wednesday's night's episode pulling in just 571,000 metro viewers.

The figures put it behind Channel Nine's The Block, which pulled 651,000 metro viewers, and ABC's Hard Quiz, which was the top entertainment program of the night with 672,000 metro viewers.  

Fortunately, The Bachelor topped key demographics, which means Channel 10 will most likely still consider the show a success.

This isn't the first time the Channel Ten dating program has been beaten in the ratings by Hard Quiz. 

The Bachelor's inaugural episode only pulled in 681,000 metro viewers, which is the show's lowest-ever audience for a season premiere. 

Regional numbers boosted this figure to 872,000 nationally, but the debut episode was still behind ABC's Hard Quiz in the ratings.

However, the network's head of programming, Daniel Monaghan, was still pleased with the amount of viewers tuning in to watch Locky Gilbert's search for love. 

'We're pleased with how Australians have responded to the beginning of Locky’s journey to find his one true love,' he said at the time. 

'It’s going to be a great season with lots of fun, laughter, romance, tears and, of course, more than one curveball as the contestants find themselves searching for love in a global pandemic.'
