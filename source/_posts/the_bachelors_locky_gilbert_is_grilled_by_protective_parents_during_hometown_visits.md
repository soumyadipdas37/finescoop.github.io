The end of The Bachelor is fast approaching.

And now Locky Gilbert is set to face his toughest challenge yet as he meets the families of his final four contenders during next week's hometown visits.

If the show's new teaser trailer is anything to go by, the 31-year-old hunk is about to be grilled by each of the girls' protective parents.

'Is this really love?' In a new teaser trailer for The Bachelor, Locky Gilbert gets grilled by protective family members about his reality television past during next week's home visits 

At one point, Locky's reality television past appears to have caught up with him.

'Okay, so this is your third reality TV show, is this really love?' one family member is heard asking in the preview. 

Another questions his views on feminism, to which Locky explains: 'I'm on The Bachelor, some people might think I'm not the best guy to talk about feminism.'

The Australian Survivor star also visited Bella Varelis' family, where her father issues a stern warning.

Tough questions: 'Okay, so this is your third reality TV show, is this really love?' one family member is heard asking in the preview 

'There's gonna be some hearts broken and the only heart that I care about is hers...' he warns.

To which, Locky replies: 'I totally understand that.' 

On Thursday night, Kaitlyn Hoppe was left heartbroken after she failed to get a rose from the handsome hunk.
