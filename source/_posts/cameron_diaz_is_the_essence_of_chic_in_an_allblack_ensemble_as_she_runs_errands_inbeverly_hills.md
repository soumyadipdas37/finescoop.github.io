She's the doting mother to a nearly 10-month-old baby girl.

And Cameron Diaz was seen taking some time for herself to run errands on Thursday, dressing in an easy all-black ensemble while stepping out in Beverly Hills, California.

The Other Woman actress, 48, was in a flattering black boat neck short-sleeve top, which she paired with matching high-waisted drawstring pants.

Cameron also carried a black jacket over her arm.

The Mask star added a touch of color with her patterned face mask, as well as spiffy strappy sandals that looked metallic or snakeskin in nature. 

The blond beauty had her hair back in a relaxed ponytail, and she carried a straw bucket purse. 

Diaz went about her business fresh-faces with no makeup, as she checked her smartphone and handled what looked to be a bottle of hand sanitizer.

Recently, fans of the starlet got a treat when Cameron appeared on the premiere episode of her friend Drew Barrymore's new daytime talk show.

The appearance doubled as a reunion of the Charlie's Angels stars from the 2000 film and its ensuing 2003 sequel, as Lucy Liu also joined in on the fun.

It was a special treat to be able to see Diaz in the limelight, as she has completely stepped away from acting for the past six years – the last film credit on her IMDb page is the 2014 musical update Annie, in which she played the role of Hannigan.

In the interim, she has focused on her relationship with husband of five years Benji Madden, of the band Good Charlotte.

And most recently, the pair became parents to little Raddix, born at the very end of last year.

Nonetheless, fans of the film star are holding out hope that she will one day return to the silver screen.

Cameron is not only a gifted comic actress – as seen in farces like There's Something About Mary and My Best Friend's Wedding – but also a talented and versatile dramatic performer, like in the brilliant Being John Malkovich.

Another one of her recent non-acting projects has been her successful wine brand Avaline, which has now unveiled a new red vintage.

The latest wine from Avaline comes after the welcome reception of her white and rose wines.
