They've been married for 13 years.

And John Terry seems as smitten as ever with wife Toni as he shared a loved-up snap alongside her via Instagram on Sunday. 

The former footballer, 39, wrapped his arms around his other half, 37, while they relaxed on a green garden bench at a restaurant.

Toni kept things casual for the outing as she wore a long-sleeved black shirt tucked into a pair of light-wash denim jeans.

Her brunette locks were brushed into a sleek, straight style, and she used a light palette of make-up to highlight her natural beauty.

John, meanwhile, followed her lead as he also opted for a relaxed look that teamed a comfy beige shirt with denim jeans.

He completed his look by covering his locks with a baker boy hat and wearing a pair of brown Chelsea boots.

Protection: Earlier this month, John became the latest footballer to get a family dog after being left 'traumatised' by a £400,000 raid at his £5M Surrey mansion in February 2017

Earlier this month, John became the latest footballer to get a family protection dog after being left 'traumatised' by a £400,000 raid at his £5million Surrey mansion in February 2017.

Aston Villa's assistant head coach took to Instagram to upload an image of his new Czech German Shepherd alongside the caption: 'Welcome to the family.'

The dogs, provided by special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, are able to recognise and deal with a number of different threats, including home invasion, road rage and fighting off physical attacks.

Chelsea icon John has appeared to ward off danger by proudly showing off the latest addition to his family on social media. 

The sportsman and his wife Toni, who put their home up for sale in March, were left shocked when burglars defecated at the foot of their bed three years ago.

Darren Eastaugh, 30, Joshua Sumer, 27, Roy Head, 28, and Oliver Hart, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit burglary between February 1 and March 27.

The conspiracy involved seven burglaries across Surrey and Sussex. All four were jailed for a total of 27 years and 11 months at Kingston Crown Court. 

A fifth man, Kye Hardy-King, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of handling stolen goods when some of the stolen property was found at his home. Police were able to trace them using DNA from the excrement left at the scene.  

The thugs struck after the footballer posed for pictures on the slopes of the French Alps with his long-term partner, revealing to his 3.4million followers that he was having a 'great few days away skiing with the family'.

But while the pair happily shared photos and videos of their lavish holiday, they didn't realise the posts had attracted the attention of a ruthless gang of prolific burglars.

The men spent hours ransacking the property, swiping designer handbags worth £126,000 and rare signed first edition Harry Potter books valued at £18,000. 

It was recently revealed that Kate and Rio Ferdinand have also splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.

The celebrity couple, who are expecting their first baby together this year, are said to want extra security at their mansion.

The football pundit, 41,  and the former TOWIE star, 29, have reportedly bought a pair of black German shepherds.

A source told The Sun: 'One is already at their home, and the second will be joining shortly.

'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!

'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'
