PSG are on the brink of pulling out of talks over taking Dele Alli on loan from Tottenham. 

Alli appeared to be on his way out of Spurs after Jose Mourinho dropped him amid a prolonged drop in form and he was omitted from the Europa League squad to face Lokomotiv Plovdiv last week.  

But according to the Telegraph, The French champions are now set to withdraw from negotiations due to financial terms on offer being prohibitive, despite the fact that they were encouraged to enter talks in the first place.

Jose Mourinho has said the responsibility lies with Alli to work hard and get back in the team 

Thomas Tuchel was eager to sign the England international on a one-year deal and it is understood that Alli was also interested. 

But there is little optimism a deal can be done now as neither party can agree on the financial terms.  

Inter Milan were another side in the frame but it now seems that Alli will be staying with Spurs and he is travelling to North Macedonia for the Europa League clash with Shkendija on Thursday.

Alli, not even on the bench for Tottenham's last two games, was set to start against Leyton Orient in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday but the game was called off when the League Two side were hit by positive Covid tests. 

Thomas Tuchel was keen on a deal but the financial terms were not right for PSG 

Mourinho is convinced that Alli will still be in his squad when the transfer window closes but insisted that the 24-year-old must fight to regain form and his role in the starting line-up. 

'I believe (he will stay). I can even say that I'm convinced that he will,' the manager told Sky Sports.  

'There is a tendency now when a player performs or the player doesn't perform, to give responsibilities on coaches, some because they gave him the right love, some because they gave him the right stick.

'I always feel that 99 per cent of the responsibility is the player. I have one per cent. 

'Me and my staff and the people that work with the players every day, we have one per cent of the responsibility. It is 99 per cent that belongs to them.'
