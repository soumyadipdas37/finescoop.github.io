She was seen exiting the store with her purchases that included a can of paint, a tray and some brushes.  

A week ago, Ireland became a big half-sister for the fifth time when her father Alec, 62, and his second wife Hilaria, 36, welcomed another child.

The couple added son, Eduardo, to their brood of Carmen, seven, Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two.

Last Friday, Ireland posted a selfie to her Instagram which prompted a swift response from her famous mother.

Oscar-winning actress Kim expressed alarm after her only child showed off a small black heart-shape tattoo inked high on her cheekbone close to her right eye.

'You better not had......that’s all I can say..........,' she wrote in the comments section.

Ireland, a model, later clarified that the image had been temporary, sharing a clip to Instagram Story in which she smudged it and rubbed it away.

Back in 2018, Ireland had spoken publicly about her struggles, explaining: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!'

She shared: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.

'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  

Ireland shared her journey in the hope of encouraging others not to suffer in silence and to seek help. 

'Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn’t worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn’t worth it!!' Ireland said. 

'Love yourself!! You are beautiful!! Enjoy your food. Eat ice cream with your friends! Workout and eat healthy to take care of your mind and body but find your healthy balance! Life is too short.'

Big milestone: Last month, she had celebrated being free from eating disorders anorexia and bulimia for six years. She had first spoken about her struggles with food back in 2018
