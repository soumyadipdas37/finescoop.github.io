She's been gearing up for the arrival of her first child, a baby boy, with her partner Sam Mucklow.

And Shelby Tribble pulled out all the stops to celebrate her unborn son as she  held a baby shower with her family in Plymouth on Sunday.

The former TOWIE star, 27, cradled her baby bump in a chic white jumpsuit as she rang in the occasion, complete with blue balloon arches, fun-filled games and personalised cupcakes.

Looking every inch the yummy mummy-to-be, the former beauty pageant queen stunned in the elegant one-piece by Club L London, which featured off-shoulder straps and wide-leg trousers. 

The media personality and her guests appeared in great spirits as they played pin the dummy on the baby while blindfolded. 

Following a blue theme, the hall was decorated with elaborate balloon displays by her mother Karen's company All That Sparkles Events.

Handsome couple Shelby and Sam have had a turbulent relationship, which was well documented on TOWIE. 

The duo began sleeping with each other on a 'friends with benefits' basis but things soon turned sour when Sam decided to pursue a romance with TOWIE newbie Demi Sims while on a group trip to Thailand last year.

During a heated row, the fiery star called the brunette a 's**g' but months later, the pair decided to give things another go.

However, they were met with opposition when Shelby's close friend Clelia Theodorou told her she had felt deserted because the influencer was spending all her time with the hunk.

The former BFF's had several bitter rows, with Clelia, 25, accusing her of not being there for her when she was at her lowest point after splitting from her boyfriend, who is Sam's pal.  

Shelby and Sam decided to step back from TOWIE in order to focus on their romance later that year, and have been going strong ever since.
