And Drew Barrymore was again in the spotlight on Sunday night, as a presenter at the MTV Video Music Awards.

Check out the cropped length, high neck and herringbone effect fabric. Add in a pair of Aquazzura heels, a Saint Laurent belt and jewellery by David Webb and it's a flawless look. Bravo to stylist Lee Harris!

Barrymore also celebrated her look on social media, captioning a full-body selfie with, 'very excited to be a part of this! Thanks for having me to the party!'

She tagged MTV as well as various stylists and her hair and makeup team, saying how they all 'made me feel like stepping out!!!!!!!!!! Virtually speaking !'

Drew ended up bestowing the honor of Best Direction to Taylor Swift, for her video off of last year's Lover album, The Man.

Pop culture moment: The Wedding Singer star mentioned the long-held influence of music videos when she took the virtual stage, presenting the award for best music video direction

The prize made history as only the second video direction VMA to be awarded to a woman, no less to TSwift herself for one of her first forays into solo directing. 

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.

This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.

MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’
