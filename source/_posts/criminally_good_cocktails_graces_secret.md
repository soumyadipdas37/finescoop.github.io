This fragrant drink is as lively as the thoroughbred racehorse Thomas Shelby buys, which he names Grace's Secret after his wife

This fragrant drink is as lively as the thoroughbred racehorse Thomas Shelby buys, which he names Grace's Secret after his wife. 

He hires the seductive May Fitz Carleton (Charlotte Riley) to train her, and a love triangle ensues.

For 1 glass – Preparation: 5 minutes

Pour the gin, vermouth, elderflower liqueur and bitters into a mixing glass filled with ice. 

Mix using a long, slim spoon. Strain into a cocktail glass without ice. Squeeze the lemon twist into the glass before using it for garnish.

Grace started out as an agent for Birmingham Police but fell in love with Tommy Shelby
