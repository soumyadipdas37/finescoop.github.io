Cheetah Girls star Sabrina Bryan is a new mom.

Sabrina and Jordan revealed the happy news that they were expecting their first child together back in March.

While moving into a new house on Saturday night, Sabrina went into labor and her water broke, a rep for the actress told People.

A few hours later, the baby made her first appearance into the world at 2:03 a.m. in Newport Beach, California.

A tiny newborn, she weighed in at 6 lbs., 13 oz. and measured just shy under 20 inches long. The rep added that Sabrina was lucky and pushed for just 30 minutes.   

The Dancing With the Stars alum reportedly chose the name Comillia after her mom  but in following with her family tradition, the baby will go by her middle name Monroe.

Sabrina also goes by her middle name - she was born Reba Sabrina Hinojosa - and uses the surname Bryan professionally. 

'We are all enjoying our new little love,' the new parents told Us Weekly in a brief statement on Tuesday. 

Sabrina and Jordan tied the knot in 2018 in a lavish wedding at the Las Vegas home of Wayne Newton. The couple had dated for six years before getting engaged. 

Then, the duo revealed that they were expecting a baby back in March and the actress has been documenting her pregnancy on social media.

'We are all enjoying our new little love,' the new parents told Us Weekly in a brief statement on Tuesday 

Recently, the star has been anxiously awaiting the arrival of her bundle of joy.

'I can’t wait to hold you in my arms baby girl! We’ll see you so so soon,' she wrote on social media last week.

Bryan rose to fame in the mid-2000s as Do Thomas in Disney's ultra popular Cheetah Girls film franchise and the subsequent pop music group of the same name. 

She competed in season five of Dancing With the Stars with partner Mark Ballas and then returned to compete again in season 15. She was eliminated in week six both seasons.
