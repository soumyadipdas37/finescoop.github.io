Two lesbian lovers are accused of killing and dismembering a hotel worker and keeping his torso, head, forearms, hands and feet for several days.

Maria Malveiro, 19, and her nurse lover Mariana Fonseca, 23, allegedly chopped off Diogo Goncalves's fingers to access his bank account from his mobile using his prints and steal a £60,000 inheritance, local media reports.

They then kept his dismembered body parts in two cars - including Mr Fonseca's own Mercedes -  before allegedly dumping his head, forearms, hands and feet by Pego do Inferno waterfall close to the Algarve town of Tavira in Portugal. 

His torso was thrown into the sea from cliffs in the Algarve town of Sagres one day earlier.

Gruesome details about the 21-year-old's murder and the disposal of his body parts - which was inspired by US police series Dexter starring Michael C. Hall - emerged today as prosecutors prepared to put the women on trial.

Mr Fonseca was strangled to death on March 18 but the women allegedly threw his torso into the sea four days later.

They used a print from a finger they had cut on his right hand to access his mobile and transfer the cash, and waited another 24 hours to dump the rest of his body.

The indictment says they spent the three days between March 20 and 23 sending messages from his Facebook account to fool colleagues and friends into believing he was still alive.

They will be tried for a string of crimes including murder, desecrating a body, computer fraud and using a stolen vehicle. 

Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias reported Malveiro took advantage of the fact she knew Mr Fonseca 'fancied' her to give him an orange juice laced with sedative Diazepam after promising him a lap dance at his home and tying him to a chair before strangling him and dismembering him with her nurse lover.

Reports at the time claimed the women allegedly tried to make it look as if he had killed himself by leaving the car overlooking the sea in Cape St Vincent in Sagres.

They said investigators suspected the pair slipped up after throwing the torso from a clifftop fort near stunning Beliche Beach.

It didn't 'land' in the water and left vital clues after it ended up on dry land.

A Policia Judiciaria spokesman said in a statement after their arrests: 'The PJ has identified and arrested two women on suspicion of a crime of murder and profanation of a body.

'The crimes occurred in the Algarve region between March 20 and 25.

'The victim, a Portuguese citizen aged 21 who lived on the Algarve, was dismembered and parts of his body have been found in the areas of Sagres and Tavira.

'The police investigation sparked by the appearance of the body parts in the Tavira area led to the obtention of important evidence and the identification and arrest of the suspects.

'The detainees are aged 19 and 23 and have a clean criminal record.'

The murder victim had received his inheritance after his mum was run over in July 2016 in Guia near Albufeira.
