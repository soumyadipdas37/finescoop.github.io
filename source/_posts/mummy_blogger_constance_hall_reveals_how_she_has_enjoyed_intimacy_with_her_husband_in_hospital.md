Blogger Constance Hall has revealed how she enjoyed 'intimacy' with her husband in hospital while he recovered from a horror motorbike crash.  

The Western Australian mother-of-seven shared the intimate details of her sex life with Denim Cooke to her 1.3million Facebook followers on Friday. 

Constance said Denim was going to be discharged from the Perth hospital for the weekend after recovering from the life-threatening crash on August 16.  

Denim was riding with a friend when he came off his bike and broke his back in four places, he also broke seven ribs, a foot and punctured both lungs.

The mummy blogger discussed post-injury sex with an occupational therapist in preparation for her husband's home visit.  

'The OT asked me if I had any questions about intimacy post traumatic injury,' she wrote. 

'I was like "actually we've already crossed that bridge, by drawing the curtains, not because we were looking for an exciting public place to f**k, but because the only time Denz has been aloud out of his carers sight is when I'm there".'

Constance didn't leave anything to the imagination and continued to reveal X-rated details.  

'He couldn't even shower alone so I knew he hadn't even been able to have a cheeky masti and obviously I missed his... Sorry that's probably a little...,' she wrote.

Constance also said the therapist advised the couple to keep Denim 'lying down' in the bedroom to protect his spinal injuries.

She also shared her frustration at spending six weeks apart while caring for their huge family.     

'I have eaten nothing but Caramilk chocolate and golden KitKats for six weeks... ain't nobody safe underneath me,' she joked.  

'Somehow it's the thought of going on top that has just pushed me off the cliff of exhaustion.'

Constance said an occupational therapist had advised the couple to be intimate with Denim 'on his back' to protect his spinal injury 

Constance said she was optimistic about Denim's recovery and he improved when the couple spent time together.    

'Believe what you will, but every time I have updated publicly about Denz's condition the following day when I arrived to the hospital he had made a hugely significant improvement,' she said.

'I believe our combined energy has a lot to do with this weekend that I'm cherishing so much and the fact that Denzi will returns to me, even better than new.'   

Their brood consists of Constance's four children Billie-Violet, Arlo Love, twins Rumi and Snow from her previous marriage, and Denim's two sons Zeyke and Sunny. 

The couple also share toddler son Raja.
