Today show reporter Lara Vella suffered an awkward gaffe during her live cross on Wednesday morning.

After being introduced by Alex Cullen, the Sydney-based journalist began discussing the New Year's Eve fireworks possibly being cancelled.

But while she looked professional, the Today cube on Lara's microphone looked odd as it was placed on upside down.

Lara noticed the error on her microphone after rewatching her segment and shared a photo to Twitter.

'Happy Wednesday,' she wrote adding an upside down smiley face emoji.

This isn't the first time a major network has suffered a embarrassing gaffe recently.

In May, Channel Seven's Weekend Sunrise host Matt Doran experienced an awkward moment on live television.

The 36-year-old was left red-faced when the breakfast program suffered technical issues and failed to switch to the next segment.

After Matt threw to reporter Sarah Greenhalgh in Italy, the screen suddenly switched to Sportsbet's Inside Trading hosted by Simon Marshall.

Simon was shown reading his script while casually dropping the F-word.

As the footage continued playing, Sportsbet analysts Julian Vallance and Ben Clifton could also be heard having a conversation.

The segment then switched back to Sarah reporting on coronavirus cases in Italy.

Back in the newsroom, Matt brushed off the technical glitch, saying: 'Sarah Greenhalgh reporting there and let's get some more news now with Sally.'
