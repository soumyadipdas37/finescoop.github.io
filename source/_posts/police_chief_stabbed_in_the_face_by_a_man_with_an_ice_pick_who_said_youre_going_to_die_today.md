A South Carolina police chief was stabbed in the face by a man with an ice pick who came to his front door and told him he was 'going to die', police say.

Bonneau Police Chief Franco Fuda said on Monday he heard a knock at the door of his home and found the suspect identified as Forrest Bowman around 10am.

Bowman allegedly told the chief he was 'going to die today' and stabbed him below the left eye with the ice pick, leaving Fuda with a bloody cut on the face.

Fuda had been in the processing of dialing 911 when the suspect fled to his mobile home.

Authorities arrived and surrounded the mobile home but Bowman refused to come out and ignored commands to surrender in a standoff with SWAT officers, according to WCSC.

Berkeley County deputies sent a scout robot into his trailer and threw a tear gas bomb into the home before entering, officials say.

He was found naked and screaming hiding behind a mattress and a wall and was arrested around 12.30pm.

On Tuesday night a judge denied Bowman bond and he faces charges including attempted murder for an assault, according to WYFF.

Officials added Bowman had been arrested in the past.

He was recently arrested for allegedly threatening the pastor of a nearby church and cops.

According to court records, Bowman has been out on bond on charges that he threatened Fuda two years ago.

'I used to feed him at my house, he was a good friend of my sons. I’ve known him since he was a child. But he’s mixed up I guess with the wrong crowd. It’s sad. It’s very sad,' Debbie Hood, who knows Bowman, said. 

Investigators are now searching for a motive behind the attack. 

Fuda was treated at a hospital on Monday afternoon.
