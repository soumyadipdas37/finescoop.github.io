When she is not jet setting around the globe, Kate is busy quarantining at her lavish Los Angeles home with beau Goody Grace, 23, her Pomeranian, and her two cats.

A source recently told HollywoodLife that the age gap couple, who were first linked in April, 'actually have a lot in common.' 

'Kate is a free spirit and she appreciates that Goody is talented. He’s really mature, and they can have deep conversations but also can be really playful and goofy at the same time.

'She just enjoys being with him and she loves him for who he is. He treats her with complete respect and what else could a woman ask for in a partner.'
