Bunnings has pulled an axe-throwing Santa Claus decoration from shelves after it was deemed 'inappropriate' for Christmas.

Eyebrows were raised over the $129 outdoor inflatable, which features a smiling Saint Nick hurling weapons at a reindeer pinned to a rotating dartboard and looks more suitable for Halloween than the festive season.

And it seems the Australian hardware giant quickly took note of the response.

'While we're always looking for unique Christmas items, we decided this product wasn't appropriate and we've withdrawn it from sale,' Bunnings director of merchandise Mr Bishop said on Tuesday.

Reactions to the unique fixture were mixed, with some shoppers branding it 'peculiar' while others praised its individuality.

At a store in Innaloo, nine kilometres from Perth CBD, a mother was overheard saying: 'I'm horrified, but want one.'

'It's really cool, the target deflates after being 'axed' and pops back up again. There's a few new ones in this year,' one woman said on Facebook.

Another tagged her friend, writing: 'Please get this for next year!'  

One customer saw the product withdrawal coming.

'Here come the offended people demanding it be pulled from the shelves,' he said.

In good news for those who missed out on the sadistic Saint Nick, Bunnings has plenty of other inflatable Santas engaging in a variety of activities which range from the traditional to the downright zany.

Options include Santa playing a saxophone, driving a forklift full of gifts, riding a shark and standing alone, watching the world go by.

They're all part of Bunnings 2020 festive range which was released in August to brighten the mood amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

The collection – which is only available in select stores – also includes pink reindeer, LED and fibre optic trees and giant Nutcracker soldiers that tower over a metre high.
