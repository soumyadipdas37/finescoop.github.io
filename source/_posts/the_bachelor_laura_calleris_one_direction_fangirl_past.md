She might appear cool as a cucumber on The Bachelor, as she vies for the romantic attentions of Locky Gilbert.

But eight years ago, Laura Calleri, 24, was just another ardent One Direction fan, like scores of girls across the globe, swooning over their good looks. 

In resurfaced tweets from 2012, it's crystal clear the then-16-year-old had a thing for singers Harry Styles and Niall Horan.

'Can I just say, your profile picture is very attractive,' she gushed in one tweet to Niall Horan. 

'Today I looked up the definition of perfection, two words Niall Horan xo,' she wrote in a second.

In another post dated December 10, Laura tells her followers Harry Styles was on her 'wish list' for Christmas.

But it appears One Direction aren't the only boyband the reality star was fixated on.

Several posts shared from her account weeks earlier see her gushing over Australian comedy group, The Janoskians.

In one tweet to singer Luke Brooks, she writes: 'Tell me you're still in Perth!!'

'You'll never see this, but it's worth a shot saying you seem like you're an amazing guy,' she wrote in another.

On The Bachelor, Laura left Locky, 31, speechless in the season premiere when she asked him if he would court her with luxury goods.

She has since made a name for herself as a too-cool-for-school villain on the show.
