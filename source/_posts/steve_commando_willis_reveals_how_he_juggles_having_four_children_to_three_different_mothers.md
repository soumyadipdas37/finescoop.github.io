Former Biggest Loser trainer Steve 'Commando' Willis has spoken candidly about fatherhood and being a single dad to four children. 

The 44-year-old has four children to three different mothers, and has revealed his approach to juggling it all. 

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph this week, Commando said that he prioritises talking about his ex-partners in a 'positive light' for the sake of the children. 

'You have to talk about the other parent in a positive light': Steve 'Commando' Willis revealed this week how he juggles having four children to three different mothers - after his split with Michelle Bridges (pictured, with their son Axel)

'My children are their mother and me and (you need) to be mindful of that part within them and talk of the other parent in a positive light because otherwise children start to question their identity,' Commando said.

'You want them to focus on just being the age that they are.'

Commando added that he relies on 'routine' to juggle his commitments to his offspring.

The fitness buff sweetly added that his children are his 'greatest teachers' in life. 

'They have taught me a lot about life and things that I felt fell short for me when I was younger,' he said.

Commando and ex Michelle Bridges began dating in 2015, after splitting from their respective partners.

In January this year, Commando and Michelle announced their shock split.  

After their break-up, Michelle was arrested for drink driving on Australia Day and was later convicted.  

She was fined $750 and had her licence disqualified for three months, after pleading guilty to mid-range drink driving.

A tearful Michelle said outside court: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep remorse, shame and humiliation [over] this incident and extreme lack of judgment.

'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment and the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'

Commando is now dating F45 trainer Harika Vancuylenberg.
