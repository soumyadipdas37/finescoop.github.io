She returned to present her Smooth Radio show this week so husband Derek Draper 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'

And Kate Garraway fuelled up on coffee as she was spotted leaving Global studios on Thursday, after a busy morning presenting Good Morning Britain and her show.

The host, 53, looked effortlessly chic in a silky pink midi dress which had a pussycat bow neckline.

Kate complemented the dress with a leather biker jacket and opted for comfort on her feet with gold trainers.

She accessorised the look with a tan shoulder bag and wore a blue face mask as she made her way to her car. 

In need of a perk-me-up after an early start, Kate treated herself to a large coffee.

Kate took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek, 53, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19.

But last week she announced she would be returning to her Smooth Radio show so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'  

She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break.

Derek was hospitalised back in March after suffering complications from contracting COVID-19, and has remained there since.   

Last Thursday the TV star revealed how she celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Derek after being unable to visit him in hospital.  

Speaking on Good Morning Britain, she revealed she was able see him later in the day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a limited consciousness state.

Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.

'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again. 

'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.'    

Derek is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. 

Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.

She shares Darcey, 14, and William, 11, with Derek.
