An Australian dad has shared an amusing handmade card his son gave him for Father's Day, with many viewers saying they had to look twice at the scrawled words. 

On Sunday across the country millions of dads celebrated the occasion with perhaps a well-earned sleep-in and a present or two from their youngsters.  

'It took a second to understand the message of my Fathers Day card this morning,' Reddit user elipse173 posted along with a picture of the card after the day.

People commenting on the post said the were impressed with the boy's effort though he might need to work on his spelling. 

'He was torn between two words,' one person said. 

'Keep it and bring it out on his 21st,' another person said.  

'Your son's handwriting is similar to mine. Probably even better, just a bit too big. A child that can't spell thank you is better with a pen,' added a third. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the father who preferred to go by his Reddit handle, said his son is 11-years-old and has dyslexia. 

'He said he was in a bit of a rush and was using texta on a card he made,' the father from New South Wales said.

'He realized he had started wrong but couldn't go back and change it. My wife and everyone else I have showed it to has had the same reaction. A double take and laugh,' he said. 

Other fathers also posted examples of handmade cards they received on Sunday. 

Some were equally as amusing, while others were examples of some genuine artistic talent, featuring Australian icons as the Sydney Swans and cartoon character Bluey.
