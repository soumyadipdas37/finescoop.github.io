An NHS worker who said she did &#039;f*** all&#039; during the pandemic and claimed coronavirus was a &#039;load of b******s&#039; is now being investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Care UK employee Louise Hampton recorded a video criticising a certificate she had been given thanking her for &#039;making a difference to patients&#039; amid the virus outbreak.&nbsp;
In the clip, posted to her Facebook page, she says&nbsp;&#039;I&#039;m an actual NHS worker and apparently I worked really hard during Covid. Did I b*****ks. That&#039;s why it&#039;s a certificate of b*****ks.
&#039;Our service was dead. We weren&#039;t getting the calls, it was dead. Covid is a load of b*****ks, so this is my certificate of b*****ks.
&#039;I didn&#039;t clap for the NHS, I didn&#039;t clap for myself. Because why would I clap for myself when I did f*** all?&#039;
Ms Hampton has since posted a selfie while on the way to London to join more than&nbsp;10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who&nbsp;believe coronavirus is a hoax at the &#039;Unite for Freedom&#039; rally on Saturday.

Ms Hampton has since posted a selfie while on the way to London to join more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax at the &#039;Unite for Freedom&#039; rally on Saturday (pictured&nbsp;&nbsp;Protesters march towards Westminster from Trafalgar Square during a demonstration organised by a group called &#039;Stand Up X&#039;, in London on Saturday)
She wrote &#039;En route to Trafalgar Square! So excited! We are the 99% #London #Plandemic #Covid1984&#039;
At the event, demonstrators called for an &#039;end to Government lies&#039; and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament.
The day after posting her video, Ms Hampton posted saying she had received &#039;so many messages of support&#039; from people, including NHS workers.
But she added &#039;A few people close to me have labelled me &#039;&#039;mental&#039;&#039; and even said I need sectioning for my video!&nbsp;
&#039;Also I don&#039;t deserve my children! However, if people want to believe the narrative that&#039;s up to them. I will keep speaking my truth!!!&#039;
Ms Hampton has made a series of posts online about the virus using the hashtags&nbsp;#Covid1984, #NWO, #SaveOurChildren, #Plandemic and&nbsp;#WeWillNotBeMuzzled.
She also posted a meme which read &#039;If you&#039;ve ever wondered whether you would have complied during 1930s Germany, now you know&#039;

A Care UK spokesman told MailOnline&nbsp;&#039;We are aware of this video, which we consider to be materially inaccurate in a number of ways, and can confirm that a member of staff is subject to investigation.
&#039;We expect all our colleagues and services to support the work of the NHS in giving the public the right information and support during the pandemic.&nbsp;
&#039;Our call centres were, in fact, exceptionally busy, handling a peak of 400% more calls than usual.&nbsp;
&#039;Our teams showed huge commitment and dedication in delivering the service, and we have rightly thanked them for the efforts they have made.&#039;​​&nbsp;&nbsp;
