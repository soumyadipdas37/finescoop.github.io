Burberry kicked off the beginning of this year's London Fashion Week with an impressive outdoor show for an audience of none. 

Taking place deep in the British countryside, the beautiful models showcased the new Spring/Summer 2021 collection strutting their stuff down a wood clearing.  

But the impressive display was unable to be witnessed and appreciated by a physical audience due to coronavirus restrictions - which threatened to put the brakes on the much-loved week of designer catwalks.

The latest collection was displayed as the models strutted their stuff in the nature-inspired show, which took place in between ferns and tall pine trees

A photograph was provided by Burberry to capture the 'ambience' of the setting of the runway show which took place in a forest

Instead, those keen to catch a glimpse of the show were forced to watch it through a screen via live stream on Instagram and Twitch this afternoon.

It is just the latest development and adaptive measure the fashion industry has taken to try and work around the virus restrictions which has meant shows are now open to all as never before.

The looks, designed by chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, ranged from simple white t-shirts and hoodies to elaborate colourful designs with flashes of orange and azure blue. 

Stilettos were ditched for boldly-coloured thigh high boots, with accessories including clear-framed glasses and black leather sunhats.  

Models walked the woodland runway in a selection of bright and bold outfits, but maintained a social distance from one another

Models donned all-leather outfits and trench coats with added leather and denim panelling gave a daring edge to the wardrobe staples.

While walking down the long track, surrounded by looming tall pine tress, the models maintained a safe social distance - in line with government guidelines. 

The show is one of many to take place this year, despite fears they would be axed amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus. 

Instead, fashion houses have been forced to host pared-down versions of their usually grand shows - sometimes taking place without and audience or a smaller crowd.

Live catwalk shows were given the green light by The British Fashion Counci (BFC) at the beginning of this month. 

The BFC said: 'LFW is one of the few international events to still be going ahead in London, proving the industry's resilience, creativity and innovation in difficult times.'

Other models wore modern takes on the classic Burberry trench  with flashes of denim and the traditional check on show

More than 80 designers, including Paul Costelloe and Victoria Beckham, are expected to be showcasing their designs during the week long event, with seven of the shows taking place in front of a condensed live audience. 

Around 20 of the shows will be an amalgamation of physical and digital, while the other 50 will take place online - like Burberry's display today.

The twice-yearly showcase is an integral part of the UK fashion sector, which in 2019 contributed £35 billion to the economy and fashion employed more than 890,000 people before the pandemic. 

The menswear collection saw all-white outfits with shark and mermaid print detailing and hints of punk-like silver spikes

Many of the models wore electric-blue garments featured in Burberry's new Spring/Summer 2021, with white and cream accessories

Around £100 million in orders is usually placed during LFW each season from industry buyers shopping for designer stock for high-end department stores, boutiques and fashion websites. 

Those keen to take in the magic of the event will be able to anyone can access the official LFW hub (london fashionweek.co.uk), which will be hosting exclusive multimedia content, until next Tuesday.

Because the scaled-down show format cannot deliver the usual 'wow factor' many, including Victoria Beckham, have created digital films to dazzle, too. 

Other designers are offering more intimate one-to-one showroom appointments to present to small fashion teams.

This all comes in stark contrast to the usual 50 to 100 shows staged over six days during LFW, where designers out-do each other in choosing extraordinary venues, from car parks to gin palaces, and hundreds of bodies cram into a tight space.
