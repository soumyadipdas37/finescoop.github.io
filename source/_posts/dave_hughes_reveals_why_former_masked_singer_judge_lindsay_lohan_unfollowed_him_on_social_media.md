Lindsay Lohan was unable to return to Down Under to resume her role as a judge on The Masked Singer Australia this year, due to coronavirus restrictions. 

And after departing the official panel of the show, she unfollowed her co-stars on social media - one of them being comedian Dave Hughes. 

And Dave, 49, feels he has a strong theory as to why Lindsay, 34, no longer wanted to see his posts. 

Bye! Lindsay Lohan was unable to return to Down Under to resume her role as a judge on The Masked Singer Australia this year, due to coronavirus restrictions. After departing the show, she unfollowed her co-stars on social media - including comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) 

Speaking to The Herald Sun on Tuesday, the TV star said: 'I know what it's like if you're on a TV show and then you're not for whatever reason and you see people on that show you were on having fun. 

'You don't want to see that, it's annoying. So I absolutely understand,' he insisted, adding that he would do the same in her situation. 

However Dave admitted he had begged Lindsay to re-follow him after realising he'd been dropped by the Hollywood star - but she ignored him. 

Ideas: Dave, 49, feels he has a strong theory as to why Lindsay, 34, no longer wanted to see his posts. 'You see people on that show you were on having fun. 'You don't want to see that, it's annoying. So I absolutely understand' Dave said on Tuesday. Pictured: Lindsay Lohan 

Oh dear! Dave admitted he begged Lindsay to re-follow him. 'I did ask her on WhatsApp if she can re-follow me on Insta. I could see that she'd read the WhatsApp message but she still hasn't followed me again!' he said

'I did ask her on WhatsApp if she can re-follow me on Insta. I could see that she'd read the WhatsApp message but she still hasn't followed me again!' he said. 

Lindsay also unfollowed judges Dannii Minogue and Jackie 'O' Henderson, and Jackie was also sympathetic about the former child star's decision. 

Jackie said on her KIIS FM breakfast show that she believes The Parent Trap star took the drastic measure because she didn't want to be 'constantly reminded of the job she really wanted but couldn't have'.

It's okay! Jackie (pictured) was also sympathetic about the former child star's decision. She said: 'I think the reason she might have unfollowed us is that she doesn't want to see all The Masked Singer stuff because she really did want to be a part of it' 

She said: 'I think the reason she might have unfollowed us is that she doesn't want to see all The Masked Singer stuff because she really did want to be a part of it. 

'You don't want to be constantly reminded of the job you want to do, but can't do right now because of COVID.'

'I'm assuming that's why and not because there's any other reason,' the radio personality added.

Jackie added: 'You don't want to be constantly reminded of the job you want to do, but can't do because of COVID. I'm assuming that's why and not because there's any other reason'
