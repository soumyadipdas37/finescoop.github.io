Sofía Vergara has been enjoying some quality time with husband Joe Manganiello during quarantine.

But the Colombian-American actress was seen on a solo outing on Friday.

The America's Got Talent star cut a sexy look in a satin zebra-print tank top, trimmed in black lace, as she stepped out for some retail therapy in Los Angeles.

The 48-year-old wore the top partially tucked into some distressed jeans, which were ripped at the knee and cuffed at the ankle.

She finished the look with a white face mask, a gold medallion necklace and a pair of strappy black platform stilettos, while carrying a woven handbag with a gold chain.

Vergara also took to Instagram from the car, as she sported a pair of cat-eye readers from her collaboration with Foster Grant.

She recently revealed that her outings remain rare, other than filming AGT, as she continues to nest with Manganiello, 45.

She and the True Blood actor are preparing to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary in November.

Manganiello previously gushed over his wife to People: 'I knew pretty quickly that I could trust her, and she knew pretty quickly that she could trust me. And we’re both the kind of people who are capable of putting the other person ahead of ourselves. 

'I was capable of putting her wishes ahead of mine, whatever they were, and she was capable of doing the same. Once you have that, you don't let go of it.'

Happy anniversary! But Vergara is enjoying quarantine with husband Joe Manganiello, 45, ahead of their fifth anniversary in November: 'We don't leave the house, we don't social mingle with anyone'
