The Countess of Wessex appeared effortlessly elegant when joining a Ministry of Defence roundtable today.

Sophie, 55, who lives with her husband Prince Edward, 56, and their children Lady Louise Windsor, 16, and James Viscount Severn, 12, at Bagshot Park, between Windsor and Guildford, joined Minister of the Armed Forces James Heappey at the occasion.

The pair took part in the virtual roundtable with civil society organisations to discuss the continued integration of Human Security - which gives primacy to people as well as the security of the state - into military operations.

Sophie looked the epitome of sophistication in a blue and black striped frock, teamed with an eye-catching pearl necklace.

The mother-of-two swept her loose blonde locks to the side and completed her look with a touch of glamorous makeup.

She accessorized with matching pearl earrings and a large cream bag, which she clutched over her shoulder.

Earlier this week, Sophie cut a casual figure as she visited Coverwood Farm in Cranleigh, Surrey.

The royal's visit comes just days after she was joined by her husband and their two children Lady Louise and James, 16, Viscount Severn, 12, as they took to Southsea Beach in Portsmouth to pick up litter.  

The Countess donned a pair of blue denim skinny jeans and paired them with a pink and white pair of deck shoes, while her hair was swept back in an elegant bun.

A day earlier, Sophie was spotted riding a horse and carriage in the grounds of the Queen's residence in Berkshire. 

Former PR executive Sophie lives at Bagshot Park in Surrey, with Edward and their two children and is widely recognised to be the Queen's favourite royal.   

The Queen and Sophie's close bond is said to be down to their similar interests, with the pair often spending Saturday or Sunday evenings together at Windsor, watching old war films and historical documentaries.

Sophie, who was brought up in Kent by a tyre company executive father and a secretary mother, is even thought to have convinced the Queen to watch The Crown - suggesting she might enjoy the Netflix series which is based on her reign.  

The Wessex family are often spotted taking part in outdoor activities at Windsor Castle, which is just 10 miles from their home at Bagshot Park.
