Skinnygirl CEO Bethenny Frankel revealed Thursday that she is still technically married to her estranged second husband Jason Hoppy nearly eight years after they legally separated in December 2012.

The topic came up when Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen asked the 49-year-old Manhattan socialite if she was going to marry her boyfriend since October 2018, Rubicon Real Estate managing partner Paul Bernon.

That's when Bethenny flashed a huge grin and confessed: 'I'm still married...Crickets again! And scene. And we're back. And we're walking.'    

Whoa! Skinnygirl CEO Bethenny Frankel revealed Thursday that she is still technically married to her estranged second husband Jason Hoppy (R) nearly eight years after they legally separated in December 2012 (pictured in 2014)

Frankel's 52-year-old former boss was so shocked his jaw literally dropped: 'You're killing me.'

The BStrong founder officially filed for divorce from the 50-year-old pharmaceutical sales executive in January 2013 after nearly three years of wedded bliss and a bitter legal battle ensued.

Bethenny and Jason reached a financial settlement in July 2016 and they reached a custody agreement over their 10-year-old daughter Bryn in June 2014.

Frankel - who was in no mood to go into details of her pending divorce - looked fabulous in a sleeveless Keith Haring-print top and black joggers for her appearance on the Bravo talk show.

Cohen then asked the Bravo-lebrity if she'd ever consider coming back on The Real Housewives of New York City after quitting the reality show back in August 2019.

'If you get my gate code and there's a Brink's truck full of a lot of cash, you know. It's all about the Benjamins, baby!' Bethenny joked.

'I don't know. Who knows! I have a different career now as a result of not being on...I'm happy. I had a good run!'

It's hard to believe the cable network only paid Frankel $7,250 to star in the inaugural season of RHONY then called 'Manhattan Moms' way back in 2008.

However, the NYU grad - who's still friends with Dorinda Medley and Sonja Morgan - admitted she missed having a reason to put clothes and make-up on all the time: 'I'm always in pajamas.'

Bethenny launches her Endeavor Content podcast Just B with Bethenny Frankel featuring self-made moguls next Tuesday, and it's already reached No. 6 on the iTunes chart for subscriptions.

Frankel - who boasts 4.9M social media followers - tweeted Thursday: 'From the racetrack, to the liquor business, and now podcasts, I'm a woman living in a man's world. Well, that's about to change. I'm coming for you @joerogan!'
