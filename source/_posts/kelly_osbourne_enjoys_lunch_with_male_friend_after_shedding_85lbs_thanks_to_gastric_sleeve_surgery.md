She astounded fans when she revealed recently she'd shed 85lbs after undergoing gastric sleeve surgery.

And on Wednesday, Kelly Osbourne showed off her slimmer figure as she enjoyed lunch in Malibu with a male friend.

Kelly, 35, paired a gray t-shirt and cropped black leggings with silver patterns for her ocean-side outing.

The daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne added layers to her ensemble with a stylish cropped black jacket and had a black and white plaid shirt knotted around her waist.

She also carried a black hoodie and stepped out in pink and gray designer trainers.

Her dyed silver hair still showing remnants of pink coloring was worn up in a short ponytail and she sported distinctive black-framed glasses along with a black face mask.

Last month, in an interview on Hollywood Raw with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn, Kelly revealed that back in 2017, she'd turned to her brother Jack for help when she hit rock bottom with her drinking. 

'I was a functioning alcoholic,' she admitted. 'Full blown functioning alcoholic. I kept my job; I kept my friends. What it was for me, what I reached a spiritual low where I was just so morbidly unhappy and lost and directionless and just broken in every way.' 

Kelly explained: 'I remember I picked up the phone August 8, 2017, and called my brother and I said 'I'm done, I need some help, can you come to get me? I don't want to be a fat drunk loser anymore; I want to be a skinny winner.' I was ready to work on myself and I did it.' 

As part of her new focus, she underwent gastric sleeve surgery and has since lost 85lbs.

Family: On Sunday, her brother Jack posted a photo to Instagram showing him with their parents Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne as well as his girlfriend Aree Gearhart and his three daughters from his marriage to ex-wife Lisa Stelley

The way they were: Kelly and Jack found fame after starring alongside the Black Sabbath rocker in The Osbournes which debuted on MTV in 2002 and ran for four seasons

Kelly and Jack both became famous thanks to their famous parents when they signed on to a reality show for MTV called The Osbournes.

The show was an immediate hit when it premiered in 2002 and it ran for four seasons. 

Meanwhile, Black Sabbath rocker Ozzy, 71, says that despite being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he's not yet done with music.

His latest tour had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and he has been self-isolating at his home in Los Angeles.

But he's ready to go back on the road, telling Britain's Daily Mirror in an article published last Friday: 'You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I'll f***ing do an encore. I'm the Prince of Darkness.' 

Ozzy and Sharon have also said they are developing a biopic of the heavy metal star which will also detail their 38-year marriage and business relationship.

Sharon, 67, told the Mirror earlier this month: 'We're not making it for kids. 'It's an adult movie for adults. We don't want it to be squeaky, shiny clean and all of that.'
