Irena Srbinovska is the odds-on favourite to win The Bachelor.  

And on Tuesday, never-before-seen yearbook photos obtained by The Wash prove the reality star has always had a heart of gold.

While most of her MacKillop Catholic College classmates had high hopes, Irena only wanted two things in life - 'to be happy and have loads of friends.'

Blast from the past! Irena Srbinovska is pictured left, as a young pupil in high school, and right, a recent photo of her on The Bachelor

A much younger Irena, now 31, is seen smiling while posing for her annual high school photos more than 10 years ago. 

Irena was immediately recognizable thanks to her brunette tresses and bangs.

It comes days after Locky Gilbert and fellow finalist Bella Varelis' school photos also made their rounds online.

In the photo shared to Bachie Funny, Locky was seen smiling while standing in the back row of his school photos. 

The throwback image appeared to have mixed reactions with fans, with one person commenting: '[Locky] reminds me a bit of Wreck It Ralph.'

 Locky chose to write back, commenting with a love heart emoji: 'I'll take that.'

Upon seeing the throwback image, evicted contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe jokingly commented: 'Let's not start this trend.' 

Meanwhile, one fan voiced that Bella looked like 'one of those mean girls'.

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
