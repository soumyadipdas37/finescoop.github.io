President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump set off for Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning to mark the 19th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.

Neither spoke as they boarded Air Force One for the short flight. The president was dressed in a dark suit and tie while the first lady was in a black dress and sunglasses.

This year’s ceremony at Shanksville, the spot where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field on September 11, 2001, killing all 40 civilians on board, will be an abbreviated version due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Neither Trump wore face masks upon their departure from Joint Base Andrews.

While they are in Pennsylvania, Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Jill Biden spent the morning in New York City for the memorial ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial Plaza, the site where the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell.

There will be no keynote speaker nor musical talent. The name of each passenger and crew member will be read aloud with the ringing of the Bells of Remembrance. This moment will observe the exact time Flight 93 crashed at 10:03 a.m

The Bidens wore face masks for the event.

Biden told reporters traveling with him it was a ‘solemn day.’

‘I’m not going to talk about anything other than 9/11. We took all our advertising down. It’s a solemn day. That’s how we’re going to keep it,’ he said.

Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence were also in New York for the ceremony there. 

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg stood between the two couples during the ceremony, where bagpipes played and a bell rang at 8:46 am to mark the moment American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower.

The Bidens will travel to Shanksville in the afternoon to visit the Flight 93 National Memorial.

The Trumps will be gone by then – meaning the two presidential nominees will miss one another.

But the president and first lady will stay for the ceremony. The Trumps marked 9/11 in Shanksville in 2018 and spent the 2017 and 2019 anniversaries at the Pentagon.

The usual 90 minute ceremony in Shanksville will be reduced to a to a 20 minute 'Moment of Remembrance,' the National Park Service said. The park service arranges the memorial and cares for the area.

The hijackers had intended to fly the plane to Washington, D.C. but when the passengers on board, after learning from family members via airphone of the earlier attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, revolted and fought for control of the plane, causing it to crash.

It was the only one of the four aircraft hijacked that day that never reached its intended target - believed to be either the White House or the U.S. Capitol building. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attack.

The Flight 93 National Memorial is built around the crash site and protects the area of impact, known as the 'Sacred Ground', which remains accessible only to family members of the passengers and crew.
