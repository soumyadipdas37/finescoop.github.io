A drug arrest is now made in Australia every three and a half minutes, as surging supply of narcotics pushes the value of the illicit trade to a record $3.5billion per year.

About 26.6 tonnes of illicit substances were seized by police between 2018 and 2019, according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's Illicit Drug Data report released on Wednesday.

Figures showed that ice is by far the most consumed illegal drug across the nation, followed by MDMA, cocaine and heroin, with a police seizure every five minutes nationwide.

The report found that the weight of seized amphetamine-type substances (ATS) was more than double that of cannabis, heroin and cocaine combined, and the ACIC estimates that 11.5 tonnes of ice is consumed in Australia annually.

That compared to 4.6 tonnes of cocaine and 941,000 kilograms of heroin. 

There were 136,242 arrests for drugs in 2018-19, with 102,352 or 75 per cent of them being men.

In 2018–19 new records were set. These include: 

- 5.1 tonnes of amphetamines at the Australian border.

- 5,378 national cocaine seizures. 

- 5,016 national cocaine arrests 1,029 national hallucinogen arrests.

- 1,363 anaesthetic detections at the Australian border.

ACIC chief executive officer Michael Phelan said the market for anesthetics, such as the tranquiliser ketamine and the depressant GHB, were also on the rise.

He added: 'The number of detections of anaesthetics at the Australian border increased 1,934 per cent over the last decade.' 

New South Wales residents remain the largest consumers of all drugs, particularly cocaine which accounted for 67 per cent of arrests and more than half the national total. 

According to the report, one of the reasons for the surge in drug-related activity is a result of the online market.

It said darknet markets are appealing to buyers because they can undertake transactions remotely and remain anonymous.

The online market also provides a greater variety of stock and the ability to adjust pricing.

The weight of illicit drugs seized nationally increased 241 per cent and the number of national drug-related arrests increased 80 per cent with 153,377 arrests from 2018 to 2019.

Over the past decade, the number of national illicit drug seizures increased by 77 per cent.  

'These upward trends in national seizures and arrests highlight the continued vigilance of law enforcement in reducing the supply of all illicit drugs,' Mr Phelan said. 

'They also highlight why illicit drugs continue to be a concern for law enforcement and the wider community, and the ongoing need to reduce demand.'
