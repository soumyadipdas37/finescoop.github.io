Chrissy Teigen may be under strict bed rest orders due to a 'high-risk' third pregnancy, but that's not stopping her from handling business.

The 34-year-old entrepreneur took to social media to show a team of people helping her with hair and makeup ahead of a speaking gig for INBOUND on Tuesday. 

Chrissy shared the 'good news' with her millions of followers that she was back on the ticket for the global marketing workshop which features esteemed speakers, including Bob Iger, Van Jones, Kerry Washington and John Legend.

Sitting in her bed while wearing a nude nursing bra, Chrissy updated her 31million fans on Instagram.  

'Good news,' she said 'I am back on for Inbound. Still on bed rest, so it will be from bed, but I'm going to honor this commitment.'

Teigen sipped on a smoothie from local Los Angeles favorite, Kreation, as she chatted with her followers.

She tagged Irinel de León for hair and Kristine Studden for makeup, both of which were on hand to style her September Marie Claire cover.

Last week, the Cravings author let it slip that she's expecting a baby boy, her third child with husband John Legend.

As she detailed issues with her placenta (similar to problems she faced during her pregnancies with Luna and Miles), she assured her followers not to worry about the baby and 'he's big.'

Oh boy! As she detailed issues with her placenta (similar to problems she faced during her pregnancies with Luna and Miles), she assured her followers not to worry about the baby and 'he's big'

'Oops! I'm stupid ... anyway,' she said. 'Its growing beautifully, everything's good. I'm feeling really good, but my placenta's really, really weak and it's causing me to really bleed a lot. 

'Basically it's just pretty high-risk and, you know, it's just this poor thing has been through so much already.' 

Her doctors ordered her on strict bed rest last week due to her 'difficult pregnancy.' 

'I didn't really know that bed rest was, like, in bed,' she admitted online. 'I honestly thought bed rest was you have to really really really relax, stay home; I thought it could be couch rest.'  

Yum! Hoping to lift her spirits, Chrissy showed off an adorable #bedrest donut arrangement with unicorn sweets made by celebrity favorite, Blinkie's Donuts, from her friend Lauren Makk
