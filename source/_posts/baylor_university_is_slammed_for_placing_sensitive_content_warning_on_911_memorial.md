A Baptist university in Texas placed a trigger warning near a 9/11 campus makeshift memorial displaying American flags to commemorate those who were killed in the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Baylor University in Waco has come under fire after a ‘sensitive content’ sign was placed near the display that marked the 19th anniversary of the hijackings that killed nearly 3,000 people.

‘As Baylor students, this is incredibly saddening for us to see. 9/11 is a day that we can forget our political identities and come together to remember those who died and celebrate the triumph of our nation over evil,’ said Jake Neidert, the head of Baylor’s chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas.

The group has set up the display every year on September 11 to pay tribute to the victims of the attack.

‘Honoring those who died and first responders isn’t “Sensitive”, it’s ‘American,’ the Baylor chapter of Young Conservatives of Texas tweeted in response

This was the first year that the university decided to place a trigger warning sign next to it.

Neidert said: ‘For several years, the Young Conservatives of Texas at Baylor have carried the tradition of setting up a 9/11 memorial on Baylor’s campus.

‘2,977 American flags line Fountain Mall every year to honor the victims and first responders who lost their lives during the tragic terror attacks against the United States.

‘The memorial traditionally only includes flags and no signage or messaging.

‘Every year we do our best to ensure that this event is about America not politics.’

Baylor YCT posted a video on its Twitter feed showing the ‘sensitive content’ sign near the flags.

‘Honoring those who died and first responders isn’t “Sensitive”, it’s ‘American,’ the tweet stated.

Baylor YCT also tweeted: ‘This isn’t about politics. This was not a political event. In our event application, we actually opted to not have a sign attributing the display to us in order to be apolitical. However, Student Activities put the sign out attributing the display to us + the trigger warnings.’

In another tweet, YCT wrote: ‘We went through every effort to make this display apolitical because this isn’t about “Party” or “Politics”, it’s about the foundational American identity we all share'

In another tweet, YCT wrote: ‘YCT stands for “Principles over Party”.

‘We went through every effort to make this display apolitical because this isn’t about “Party” or “Politics”, it’s about the foundational American identity we all share.

‘That shouldn’t be a “Sensitive” issue.’

The university issued a statement in response to the uproar, saying: 'We fully support the 9/11 display of American flags, regret that the signage we used has taken away from the intent of the display, and apologize for any misunderstanding this may have caused.'

The university acknowledged that it was a ‘moving display,’ though it defended the decision to place the sign since the flags might ‘evoke a wide range of emotions.’

The school said the sign was part of a new ‘standard’ that will be applied to other ‘outdoor displays’ on campus.

Conservatives have long argued that college campuses have clamped down on free speech so as not to offend those who disagree with certain messages or viewpoints.

Colleges and universities are also being criticized for showing bias and favoritism toward liberals.

The University of Chicago's English Department is being slammed for bias and racism in deciding that it will only accept graduate school applicants interested in 'working in and with Black studies' for its 2020-2021 cycle. 

Staffers say they've been inundated with hate mail and angry backlash following the decision.  

The department shared a statement on its website in July announcing their commitment to the 'struggle of Black and indigenous people, and all racialized and dispossessed people, against inequality and brutality'.  

'For the 2020-2021 graduate admissions cycle, the University of Chicago English Department is accepting only applicants interested in working in and with Black studies,' the statement said.

The University said in a statement that it is only accepting a limited number of PhD students due to the pandemic and at the moment there are only spaces for five additional students. 

Given the movement for justice by the black community this year, the school believed it was best to award additional scholarships with a focus on black studies.

In a statement uploaded to the English department's website in July (pictured) , the faculty announced their commitment to the 'struggle of Black and indigenous people, and all racialized and dispossessed people, against inequality and brutality'

'Currently, there are 77 PhD students studying a wide variety of disciplines within the English Department, and the department is admitting five additional PhD students for 2021. The English department faculty saw a need for additional scholarship in Black Studies, and decided to focus doctoral admissions this year on prospective PhD students with an interest in working in and with Black Studies,' the university said in a statement to Fox News. 

'As with other departments in the University, the department’s faculty will decide which areas of scholarship they wish to focus on for PhD admissions in future years,' it added.

The statement was written in July as protests against police violence tore across the US. 

Earlier in the statement, the faculty says they believe that 'Black Lives Matter, and that the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and Rayshard Brooks matter, as do thousands of others named and unnamed who have been subject to police violence.'
