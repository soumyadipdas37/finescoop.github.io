Alessandra Ambrosio has practically been living on the beach this summer.

And the Brazilian model isn't about to let the smokey skies of Southern California keep her away from the water. 

She put her supermodel physique on display Saturday in a tie-dye bikini, as she hit the beach in Malibu with friends, while the Bobcat Fire continued to burn in the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.
