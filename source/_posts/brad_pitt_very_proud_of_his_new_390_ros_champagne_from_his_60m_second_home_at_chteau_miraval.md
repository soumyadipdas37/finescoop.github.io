Two-time Oscar winner Brad Pitt 'is very proud' of his limited-release $390 rosé Champagne Fleur de Miraval, which hits US shelves on October 15.

Technically, Fleur de Miraval was created in the 'Champagne House' in Mesnil-sur-Oger (where the grapes were grown) outside his 1,200-acre winery Château Miraval in the South of France. 

'The result is spectacular,' the Oklahoma-born 56-year-old gushed to People on Monday.

'Miraval isn't a "celebrity" wine for me. Above all, it's a wonderful, exceptional estate that I fell in love with, and that I continue to invest in to make it one of the finest estates in Provence. For the wine, I partnered with the Perrin family. They have been winemakers for five generations. Together, we're in it for the long term. It's not just a passing trend.'

Back in 2015, Brad partnered with his co-owner and winemaker Marc Perrin as well as Champagne grower-producer Rodolphe Péters to craft the bubbly concoction using what's called the 'saignée' method.

Pitt's first-edition 20K bottles of Fleur de Miraval were 'aged for three years on the lees of the Péters caves' and consists of 75% chardonnay and 25% young pinot noir blend.

'For me, Champagne conjures up feelings of celebration, quality, prestige, and luxury,' the Ad Astra action star explained.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's first product, a 2012 Château Miraval Côtes de Provence Rosé, was received with genuine praise when it was released. 

Winemaker and restaurateur Joe Bastianich told Vanity Fair in 2013: 'They’re not celebrity vintners; Brad and Angelina are real vintners. They hired a real wine-maker, they waited until the wine was good, they released it properly—this is a legitimate wine.'

Flavor profile: Avaline White is described as a dry wine with a crisp, fresh finish and comes from Spain

While there's good news for some, another A-lister's wine was ranked bottom in a survey last month.

Cameron Diaz' new wine Avaline, which she launched last month with entrepreneur Katherine Power, was voted least favored of five 'celebrity white wines' in a survey of nearly 400 households.

Sting and Trudie Styler's Il Palagio Roxanne Toscana Bianco 2018 and Dave Matthews' The Dreaming Tree Chardonnay 2018 were tied for first place out of the five surveyed at 26% approval. 

In 2005  Madonna and her father released Ciccone 2005 Madonna Chardonnay. It was said to be 'as intense as its namesake,' with reviews saying it would go well with 'strongly flavoured fish'. 

'But rosé Champagne is still relatively unknown. Backed by our success with Miraval in Provence, I wanted us to try to create the defining brand of rosé Champagne, focusing all our efforts on just this one color.'

In 2014, Brad wed ex-wife #2 Angelina Jolie at the 'second home' they bought for $60M in 2012 - and they still co-own the 35-room estate featuring a chapel, a moat, ancient aqueducts, a pond, and fountains. 

Last Wednesday, Pitt's rumored girlfriend Nicole 'Nico Mary' Poturalski posted an Instagram snap of two tennis rackets floating in what appeared to be his indoor swimming pool at Château Miraval. 

Five celebrity wines were ranked in a survey of nearly 400 households  during a 'Celebrity White Wine Showdown' virtual wine tasting by Mark Oldman earlier this month. 

Sting and Trudie Styler's Il Palagio Roxanne Toscana Bianco 2018 and Dave Matthews' The Dreaming Tree Chardonnay 2018 were tied for first place out of the five surveyed at 26% approval.

Oldman - who wrote the book  How To Drink Like a Billionaire: Mastering Wine With Joie de Vivre - instructed the survey group of 386 over Zoom how to evaluate the white wine and presented the contenders.

Oldman said: 'Almost everyone (88%) agreed that celebrities should not call themselves winemakers — that is a title best left to trained professional.' 

Cameron Diaz's new wine Avaline, which she launched last month with entrepreneur Katherine Power, was voted least favored of the vinos.

Other celebrities to venture into winemaking include Drew Barrymore, Antonio Banderas and Madonna.  

Jay-Z garnered attention for an ostentatious gold bottle of Armand de Brignac Champagne dubbed the Ace of Spades - which quickly became a staple choice of celebrities on high profile nights out and in music videos.

‘If you put aside the bling bling packaging and the high price tags, the content of the bottles is actually quite impressive,’ Decanter's former tasting director, Christelle Guibert said of the champagne.

Antonio Banderas' Ribera Del Duero has received less favourable reviews.

Sommelier Michael Madrigale's review to Buzzfeed in 2013 read: 'Dirty nose. Smells a bit advanced (oxidized). Dirty and sweet palate. Very ripe. Off balance. Not good.'

Mr Madrigale was also critical of Drew Barrymore's Pinot Grigio, warning the wine was 'Like drinking water with lemon in it, super diluted.'

The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor was spotted canoodling the 27-year-old A Management Model as far back as November 24 when they attended Kanye West's oratorio Nebuchadnezzar together at the Hollywood Bowl.

For the last eight years, Polish-born Nicole has reportedly been in an open marriage with 68-year-old Berlin-based restaurateur Roland Mary and they share a seven-year-old son.
