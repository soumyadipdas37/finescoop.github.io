Hugh Hefner's widow, Crystal Hefner, is remembering her late husband on the third anniversary of his death.

The former Playmate took to Instagram on Sunday, September 27, and shared a loving tribute to the Playboy magazine founder, who passed away at his home, dubbed the Playboy Mansion, in Holmby Hills, California at the age of 91. 

'Three years. It's hard to believe,' the 34-year-old began in the caption of a photo of the couple snuggled up next to each other.

'Thank you for always being my greatest ally, teaching me the definition of kindness, and making me feel extremely important and adored for ten years. I will be forever grateful.'

In another tribute, Hefner (born Crystal Harris) shared the same photo of the couple on her Instagram Stories that she headlined: 'Thinking of this legend today.'

The model, who was the Playboy Playmate of the Month in December 2009, was married to Hefner from December 31, 2012, until his death on September 27, 2017.

They wed when he was 86 and she was 26 .

The legendary publisher died from sepsis that was brought on by a E. coli infection. Sepsis is an inflammatory immune response that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its tissues and organs.

Hefner's youngest son, Cooper, from his second marriage to model Kimberly Conrad, also took to Instagram to share a heartfelt tribute. 

'We lost our father three years ago today. This will be an afternoon accompanied by Jack and Pepsi to celebrate him and our continued love,' the 28-year-old captioned a photo showing himself and brother Marston, 30, with their father when they were kids.

'We miss and love you, Dad.' 

Hefner was married to Conrad from 1989 to 2010.
