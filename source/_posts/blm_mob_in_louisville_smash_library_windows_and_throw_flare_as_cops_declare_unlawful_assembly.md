Black Lives Matter protesters smashed the windows of a public library in downtown Louisville and threw a flare inside as authorities extend a citywide curfew into the weekend and the National Guard gets ready to deploy.  

About 100 demonstrators have gathered in Louisville, defying a nighttime curfew and nearby police in riot gear, marking a second night of protests after Wednesday's decision not to pursue criminal charges against officers in the Breonna Taylor case.

The curfew took hold at 9pm in the Kentucky city as the protesters met up at the First Unitarian Church.

One of those arrested on Thursday night was Attica Scott, a Kentucky state lawmaker and author of 'Breonna's law.'

The proposed legislation would ban the use of 'no-knock' warrants statewide.

Louisville police used a 'no-knock' warrant to enter Taylor's home in the early morning hours of March 13. After Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at the officers thinking he was being robbed, police shot back and killed Taylor. 

People in the crowd chanted 'Black Lives Matter' as tensions continued for a second night in the city.

Before the march began, protester Shameka Parrish-Wright told the crowd to stay together and take care of each other if they were met with force.

'We want to show the country and the world what we’re about,' Parrish-Wright said. 

Some protesters blocked roads as they marched. Police, meanwhile, were seen nearby and patrol cars blocked some roads. 

There was no immediate signs of a confrontation.

On Wednesday, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear mobilized 500 members of the National Guard.

The governor ordered them deployed to Louisville to prevent civil unrest.

Meanwhile, city officials who initially announced a 72-hour curfew have extended it through the weekend.

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the curfew, which goes into effect from 9pm to 6:30am each night, does not apply to people commuting to work, going to houses of worship for services or seeking medical attention, the Louisville Courier Journal reported.  

Fischer has encouraged Louisville residents to begin heading home at 8pm each night so as to allow enough time to abide by the curfew. 

Earlier on Thursday evening, BLM marchers confronted about a dozen members of an armed militia.

The militia members were dressed in full military garb and carrying assault rifles. They identified themselves as 'Oath Keepers,' a group that calls itself 'nonpartisan association of current and former serving military, police, and first responders' whose goal is to 'defend the Constitution.'

The Oath Keepers members said they were in Louisville to protect property. 

'We're not here to start nothing,' a militia member from North Carolina told the Courier Journal. 

The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Oath Keepers 'one of the largest radical anti-government groups in the U.S.' 

A few BLM protesters confronted members of the Oath Keepers, but most kept away.

'Back up! Don't be stupid!' one man yelled. 

'Walk through and keep moving. Do not engage these people with no guns!'

Shortly afterward, Breonna Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, made a brief appearance at Jefferson Square Park.

She stood for a few moments at the memorial that was erected for her daughter.

Palmer, who has not said anything publicly since the grand jury decision was announced on Wednesday, wore a black satin jacket that read 'Until Freedom.'

Underneath the jacket she wore a white t-shirt with a picture of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron over the words 'Mitch's b****.'

Cameron, a Republican and the first African-American elected to the position of state attorney general, is a protege of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
