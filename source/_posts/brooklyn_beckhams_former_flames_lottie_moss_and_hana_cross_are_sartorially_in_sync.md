They are both successful models who have been linked to Brooklyn Beckham. 

And gal pals Lottie Moss and Hana Cross showed that they also share a sense of style as they headed out in matching ensembles for a night on the town.  

The pair partied until the early hours at London's Cirque Le Soir nightclub on Monday in white dresses and black jackets.

Ready to party: Lottie is a regular on the party scene and is often seen out painting the town red on a daily basis

Lottie and Hana - who are both signed with Storm Model Management - have been firm friends for months and are often seen out partying together. 

The couple became friends last year when Hana was dating David and Victoria Beckham's son, Brooklyn - so it caused shockwaves when it emerged Lottie had a fling with the photographer prior. 

News of their alleged fling came to light in November, with a source telling The Sun on Sunday that David and Victoria were 'less than impressed' after finding out.

Brooklyn and Lottie have been pals for a number of years and it is claimed that she made it clear their liaison wasn't a serious thing. 

The alleged fling was said to be 'embarrassing' for the Beckham family, as both Brooklyn and his parents have socialised with Lottie's supermodel sister Kate in the past.

After connecting with Brooklyn, the model is said to have become pals with now ex-girlfriend Hana, who split with the photographer over the summer.

Back in September, reports surfaced Victoria and David were relieved when Brooklyn and Hana split in August after nine months together.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Brooklyn and Hana have called off their romance for good. David and Victoria very glad and relieved and are backing him 100 per cent.' 

Hana has since moved on from her turbulent romance with Brooklyn and is dating Nasser Alfallah, who is a Loyola Marymount University student in Los Angeles and is originally from Kuwait. 

Meanwhile Lottie has been linked to I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! star Roman Kemp, with the pair reportedly enjoying a kiss after a 'fun, tipsy date'. 

As for Brooklyn, he announced his engagement to actress and heiress Nicola Peltz in July but has sparked rumours that the pair have already wed in secret. 

The duo also sparked pregnancy rumours when Nicola referred to a 'baby' in a cryptic post.
