Denise Van Outen ended her Cabaret show in London's Proud Embankment with a glass of wine on Tuesday night.

The West End star, 46, appeared in a giggly mood as she was joined by Marilyn Monroe lookalike Isabella Bliss for a post-show tipple. 

Denise put on a racy display as she still wore her glittering sequin-adorned bustier, fishnet tights and a top hat.

Before sitting down for a drink, Denise strutted around a pole, showing off her sexy costume.

The number had a sequin tassel belt, while the bustier was covered in silver glitter and an embroidered red rose.

Denise looked every inch the showgirl as she teamed the look with silk black evening gloves, a choker and sky-high black heels.

The star recently returned to host her Cabaret show after it had to be postponed due to coronavirus.  

And it seems as though her talents have caught the eye of ITV bosses because she has reportedly signed up to the next series of Dancing On Ice. 

The mother-of-one is said to have signed a £40,000 deal to take part in the popular TV show.

The Cabaret star is understood to have 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month. 

A source told the publication: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'   

The mother-of-one is a natural performer after reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012. 

She also played Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway and in the West End. 

The TV star is set to start training for the show but is yet to find out who her professional partner is, according to the Daily Star.  

Denise rose to fame on The Big Breakfast in 1997 and has recently starred alongside her boyfriend Eddy Boxshall on Channel 4's Celebrity Gogglebox.
