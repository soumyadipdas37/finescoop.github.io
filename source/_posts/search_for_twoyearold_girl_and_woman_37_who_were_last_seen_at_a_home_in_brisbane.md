A desperate search is underway for a two-year-old girl and a 37-year-old woman who were last seen at a home in southwest Brisbane last Friday.

The pair went missing from an address on Kulgun Circuit in Inala on September 25 and have not contacted family since.

Police and family hold grave concerns for their welfare, given the girlâ€™s young age and the behaviour being out of character.
