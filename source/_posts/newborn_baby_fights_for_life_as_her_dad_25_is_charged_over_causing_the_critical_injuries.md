A newborn baby is fighting for life in hospital and her 25-year-old father has been charged over inflicting the injuries. 

The little girl was just 30-days-old when her relatives found her with life-threatening injuries at her Gosnells home in Perth.

She was rushed to Armadale-Kelmscott Memorial Hospital just before midnight on September 4. 

Police are still investigating exactly what happened to the child but her father, Juan Daniel Visagie, has been charged with grievous bodily harm.

Detectives said a medical examination showed the baby suffered severe injuries that doctors believe are life-threatening.    

Visagie's daughter is still in critical condition, a week after the attack.

Western Australian Police confirmed a 25-year-old man related to the child has been refused bail.

He appeared in Armadale Magistrates Court on Monday and is expected to be back on Friday.   

He is being held at Hakea Prison, in Perth's south, which is a minimum to maximum security prison for men who are waiting to appear in court.
