Viewers were up in arms when Matt Lucas announced Mak was leaving the Great British Bake Off on Tuesday night. 

Despite Rowan have a disastrous three rounds with Prue Leith once again mentioning the music teacher doesn't take Paul Hollywood's advice to 'reign it in', Mak was evicted. 

Week two of Bake Off was biscuit themed, where contestants had to create chocolate florentines, macaroons and a 3D memorable meal show-stopper.

Of his exit, Mak said: 'I just felt it in my bones it was me. I know I gave it everything it was a privilege to be here.'

But fans of the show couldn't believe music teacher Rowan had escaped leaving the tent.   

Rowan seemed the clear front runner to face the axe after being unable to finish off his waistcoat florentines, leaving around half a dozen just covered in chocolate, while he placed last in the technical with his 'peculiar piped' macarons.

When he presented his Worse Things Happen At Sea, Paul said: 'It does look like a lighthouse but it tastes like rubber. 

 Prue told him she expects better of him and it's 'a bit disappointing'. 

Funny: Laura from Gravesend, Kent said: 'Hobnobs are posh where I'm from', as the contestants got under way with making their crunchy biscuits

Tricky: Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood set the bakers off with the signature task- 36 chocolate florentines with a perfect snap

Three of the bakers used mango, and while Dave's feathered florentines received good praise from the judges, Hermine's were too chewy due to her not soaking the fruit in water prior to baking. 

Prue left the tent in stitches when she told Mark of his mango lassi florentines: 'I remember worrying about your very large nuts... nice snap though'.

Well done: It was Lottie who stole the show with her quarantine florentines- a sweet treat of which has been her grandparents' favourite throughout lockdown

'I'm never washing my hand again': After taking a bite, Paul told her: 'I'm not sure what I can fault you on', before reaching out his hand to give his coveted handshake

Flustered: The 39-year-old wasn't happy with how her florentines went 

Lottie said: 'I'm never going to wash my hand again!', something of which viewers pointed out wasn't the cleverest thing to say in a global pandemic. 

Next up, was the technical challenge  - 12 macaroons, six filled with mango, six filled with coconut, golden and crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle. 

Lottie was once again praised by viewers after lending Mark her chocolate piping bag when his blocked up with just minutes to go.
