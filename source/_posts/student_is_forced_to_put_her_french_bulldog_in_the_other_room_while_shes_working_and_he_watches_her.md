A nurse left the internet in stitches after sharing photos of her French bulldog

A 26-year-old student nurse has left the internet in stitches after sharing photos of her one-year-old French bulldog Stanlee, who won't stop watching her while she works in the next room.

Alicia Lalor, from Sydney, said Stanlee is 'so needy' and 'such a stage five clinger' that he likes to be close to her at all times, which can make it difficult when she is trying to complete nursing assignments.

'I asked Stanlee to sit in the other room so I could complete my assignment,' Alicia posted on Facebook this week.

'That didn't stop him from staring at me the entire time.'

Alicia accompanied her post on Facebook with two photos of Stanlee, whose beady eyes were keenly watching her as she worked.

The 26-year-old said she has had her French bulldog - who has his own Instagram account called Stanlee the Frenchie - for one and a half years now.  

'He is such a needy baby and likes to be either touching me or staring at me at all times,' Alicia told FEMAIL.

'He's a stage five clinger that has been made worse by isolation and studying from home.'

Thousands who saw the 26-year-old's post found it hilarious. 

'If it wasn't so cute it would be creepy,' one person posted.

'Hahaha, this is so great. He's like, "ma, why don't you love me?"' another added.

A third wrote: 'This is such a great photo, and you've really brightened my day'.

Others said their dogs are the exact same and can't bear to be away from their owners for long periods of time.

Alicia explained that while she is currently working at a post office while she studies for her exams, Stanlee (pictured) has become much more needy during the coronavirus pandemic

Alicia explained that while she is currently working at a post office while she studies for her exams, Stanlee has become much more needy during the coronavirus pandemic.

This is partly because he spends so much time with her.  

'I take him with me to work every day and when I'm studying he's always with me, so he's become very used to me being around,' she said.
