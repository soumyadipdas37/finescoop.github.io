A single Australian radio producer has shared her worst Tinder date of all time, which involved a man inviting all of his conquests to a house party 'like The Bachelor'.

Triple M radio worker Jana Hocking, 36, has dubbed Tinder the 'sleaziest' online dating app after an encounter she had with a narcissistic male a few years ago.

'He had just moved into a swanky new apartment and was clearly keen to show off,' she told FEMAIL. 'I was meeting his friends for the first time, but turns out I was also meeting the other girls he was dating!'

She described how everyone was sitting in his lounge room getting to know each other when one girl casually mentioned that she was dating him.

'Then another girl was like, "wait, I'm dating him as well" and I just went straight to the bedroom to grab my bag,' Jana said.

'He came in to check on me and I told him about the other two girls and he freaked out, followed me down the stairs as I left telling me not to leave but I was out of there.'

Over the following days the man - who had acted like he was a contestant on The Bachelor - texted, called and apologised to Jana for what had happened.

'But once a player always a player. Such a douche,' she said.

After sharing the Tinder fail with her broader friendship circle Jana discovered she wasn't the only one who had been exposed to sleazy behaviour.

'My friend discovered her stepbrother was on the app. Her MARRIED stepbrother,' she told news.com.au.

'Another friend went on a date with a Tinder guy whose girlfriend slid into her DMs to inform her that he lived with her and they were expecting a child.'

She argues that more people are turning to the likes of Bumble and Hinge to procure a date, over the 'cesspit of f**kboys' that is Tinder, because you can get a feel for another person's personality before going out to dinner.

'Tinder just feels like that seedy late-night bar people go to when they're just looking for some action,' Jana said.

Despite her disaster dating story Jana has previously spoken about the importance of seeing 'more than one person at a time' to avoid needlessly getting your heart broken.

She believes that having two men at any one time is feasible but any more is a 'juggling act'.

'Plus you forget what you've said on dates and end up telling them the same story twice,' she said.

There are some downsides to employing her strategy though, namely that you could be on one date and run into the other 'date' while out and about. 

'I once got caught doing the Bondi to Bronte walk in Sydney with a guy, the morning after I had been on a date with another guy who was on the same walk,' she said.

'What was worse is that he stopped to chat and I had to introduce him to my current date.'

Once you've been on a few outings with someone and things are looking more likely to progress, that's when you'll need to decide who you want to be with.

'I think you know something is real once they have done something that would normally turn you off, like farting or having a boogie on their face, and you still like them. Not the most romantic answer but true,' Jana said.
