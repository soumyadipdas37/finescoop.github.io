She recently attended a Cathedral concert with her husband King Philippe of Belgium. 

But Queen Mathilde performed royal duties on her own on Wednesday as she visited the University of Antwerp's Center For Evaluation of Vaccines, where research is taking place into a coronavirus vaccine. 

Mathilde, 47, put on a striking display in a burgundy dress which bore a standout leaf pattern.

The mother added to her look with a matching face mask and heels. 

As she arrived, she was pictured meeting Antwerp 'Alderwoman' for education Jinnih Beels and also the province's governor, Cathy Berx. 

Mathilde was then seen talking to a female patient as medics swabbed her arm after an injection.

She later signed what appeared to be a visitor's book in front of a University of Antwerp poster.

Her solo outing comes just a day after the mother-of-four attended a concert in Ghent's Saint Bavo Cathedral with King Philippe.   

The royal couple attended the world premiere of Arvo Pärt’s 'Für Jan van Eyck' performed by Belgian choir Collegium Vocale Gent. 

The initiative for creating the piece came from the Belgian choir and was commissioned by the City of Ghent, who has dedicated the year 2020 to celebrating Jan van Eyck, a Dutch painter.

The composition was inspired by the altarpiece The Adoration of a Mystic Lamb by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck, located in St. Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent. 

The concert took place under the baton of the world-famous Belgian conductor Philippe Herreweghe and the choir will also be celebrating its 50th anniversary with this concert. 

The pair seemed in good spirits as they sat, socially distanced from other guests, to watch the musical concert. 

Cultural activities taking place in concert halls, theatres and cinemas are allowed in Belgium with a capacity limit of 200 people indoors and 400 people outdoors. 

It is also provided that social distancing of one-meter is respected and wearing a mask is compulsory.
