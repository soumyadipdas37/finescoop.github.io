She also revealed her taut midriff in various combinations of sports bra and short shorts, while propped against a wall and even in the middle of a gym.

Britney recently attempted to have her father Jamie, 68, removed from his role as sole conservator, as her conservatorship was extended as-is to February 1, 2021.

According to court documents, she's 'strongly opposed' to Jamie returning to his role, after temporarily stepping down last year.

She preferred Jodi Montgomery, the licensed conservator who took over for him in September, to remain in the position.

A source told People: 'Britney still wants the conservatorship to end at some point. But more urgently right now she doesn't want her dad to regain the sole conservator role... Jamie is very old school. He treats Britney like a child.'

Britney was placed under the conservatorship back in 2008, following a series of public mental breakdowns.

Her father has continued to remain in control of her healthcare and finances ever since, which has sparked concern among fans, who launched the #FreeBritney movement last year.

It was also revealed that the Crossroad star's younger sister Jamie Lynn, 29, was named a trustee of her fortune in 2018.
