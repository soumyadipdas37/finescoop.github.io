Nicola Sturgeon was branded 'petty' today for demanding  the words 'UK' and 'Britain' are dropped from the branding for a nationwide festival. 

The Scottish Government has objected to the working title of 'UK Festival 2022' for the event - aimed at celebrating the best of Britain.

Initially announced by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2018, planning is well under way for the £120million celebration.

At the time, Mrs May said it would help to strengthen 'our precious Union' with events to take place across the four nations.

But it emerged yesterday that the plans have stalled after the SNP Government failed to approve the use of 'UK' and 'Britain' in branding for promotional materials.

Whitehall insiders say the cultural festival, which will celebrate achievements in fields including science, technology and engineering, will bring £12million to Scotland, with the creative contracts worth an additional £3million.

However, the contracts have been delayed due to the disagreement and sources say bids cannot be put out to tender until an agreement is reached.

A UK Government source said: 'The Scottish Government are causing unnecessary delays because they want to remove all references to Britain or the UK when we launch the next phase. 

'It is incredibly petty and hugely frustrating. The creative sector is crying out for support right now.' 

The wrangling comes amid a high-stakes battle over the future of the union, with polls showing the coronavirus crisis has boosted support for independence north of the border. 

Ms Sturgeon says she has put aside the issue during the chaos, with planning for a fresh vote 'paused', but has faced accusations of trying to use the situation for political advantage. 

A Panelbase poll earlier this month found that when undecided voters were excluded, 55 per cent favoured Scotland leaving the UK, with 45 per cent preferring to stay in the union

In the 2014 referendum - billed as a once-in-a-generation decision - Scots voted by a convincing margin of 55-45 per cent to stay in the UK. 

But a Panelbase poll earlier this month found the mirror opposite.

When undecided voters were excluded, 55 per cent favoured Scotland leaving the UK, with 45 per cent preferring to stay in the union. 

Overall, 51 per cent of those questioned said they support independence, 42 per cent said they would vote to stay in the UK and 7 per cent of voters were undecided.  

The traction for Ms Sturgeon's separatist cause has sparked growing alarm in Westminster.

Rishi Sunak was dispatched to Scotland earlier this month to stress the scale of the financial support allocated by Westminster.

Figures published last week showed funding allocated to Scotland is much higher per person than that for England.

Spending on public services is equivalent to £14,829 per person there, some £1,633 per person higher than the UK average. 

In another sign of the government's determination to strengthen the bonds of union, Mr Johnson spent his 'staycation' north of the border with fiancee Carrie Symonds and their baby Wilfred.

Event planning for the festival is being led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport but it is understood ministers are taking a fournation approach with 'collaboration with devolved nations'. 

Ten events are being planned, with at least one to be held in Scotland.

The Scottish Government said it had been 'engaging positively since very early in the process on this issue' and 'any suggestion to the contrary is unfounded'.
