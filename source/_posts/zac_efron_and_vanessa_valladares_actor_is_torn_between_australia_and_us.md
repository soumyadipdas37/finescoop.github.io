He recently confirmed his relationship with Byron Bay waitress Vanessa Valladares.

And Zac Efron is reportedly now torn between his blossoming new romance in Australia and his acting career in the United States.

Since falling head over heels for 25-year-old Vanessa, the actor has friends worried he will never return to the U.S., according to Woman's Day.

'Zac's completely lost it over this girl and says he's never felt so free and alive - she cuts through all his Hollywood bulls**t,' a source claimed. 

And while Zac, 32, is living in Byron Bay for the time being, he is expected to return to America to film the Disney+ remake of Three Men and a Baby.

'He's really torn between his cosy scene with Vanessa and his crazy career,' the insider added.

Because of travel restrictions between Australia and America, the only way for the star-crossed lovers to travel together would be to get married - and they are apparently considering this as an option.

'I really think Zac's at the point where he'd marry Vanessa tomorrow if she said yes,' another insider told New Idea magazine.

It comes after Zac and Vanessa were spotted holding hands and flaunting their romance during a ski holiday in Thredbo earlier this month.

The High School Musical star reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress at the Byron Bay General Store café.

She is rumoured to have since quit her job now and is now believed to be staying with Zac at his rented home in Belongil Beach.  

Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles.

Tough times: The actor, 32, will need to return to the States soon to begin filming his next project, and Vanessa may not be able to go with him due to coronavirus travel restrictions 

'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source said at the time. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'  

Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.

But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted.

Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.
