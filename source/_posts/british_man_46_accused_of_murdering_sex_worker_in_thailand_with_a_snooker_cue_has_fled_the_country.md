A British man accused of murdering a sex worker in Thailand with a snooker cue has fled the country and is believed to be hiding in Northern Ireland.  

Neil Henry Elliott, 46, was arrested on April 30 after the unidentified sex worker was found dead at his home in Pattaya, Thailand.    

The pair are thought to have started arguing before the woman, known only as Onn, was allegedly battered with a snooker cue before being stabbed with a machete. 

The following day Elliott was taken in handcuffs to a police crime reconstruction to revisit the area where he picked up the woman from a deserted strip of bars.  

It is unclear how he was able to leave the country and travel to Ireland.

The Gardai have now launched a search for the suspect as he is 'wanted in Thailand for the murder of a sex worker,' the Irish Independent reported.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland believe that Elliot is in County Cavan and is suspected of planning to flee the country from Dublin Airport.

Elliott, who is a motorbike fanatic, reportedly has links to Louth, Monaghan and Cavan.

Police in Pattaya were not available earlier today to answer requests for information about the case.

Police Colonel Chiddecha Songhong, the original investigating officer in the case from the Banglamung district station, has been transferred to a different region, according to police.

Elliott was arrested on suspicion of murder before being handcuffed and hauled into a police pick-up truck to be driven away to the station for questioning

Elliott, from Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, allegedly admitted to police that he picked up the woman from the red-light street Soi Buakhao before they returned to his single-story home.

They then allegedly took Yaba - a powerful form of methamphetamine - and had sex.

Elliott later battered Onn, who was aged between 35 and 40, with a wooden snooker cue until the butt broke before slashing her with a 60cm-long machete on the wrists and neck, police claim.

He then allegedly left the building and crashed his motorcycle before paramedics who treated him alerted police. 

They went to the home and found Onn's dead body in the bathroom.

A large Northern Ireland flag was hanging at the entrance to Elliott's single-storey property and police later confirmed Elliott was from the country.

Elliott was immediately arrested on suspicion of murder. He was handcuffed and hauled into a police pick-up truck before being driven away to the station for questioning.

Police said at the time that Elliott had admitted killing the sex worker. 

He allegedly claimed he had acted in self-defence and instructed his lawyer to claim diminished responsibility due to the level of drugs in his system at the time of the killing.
