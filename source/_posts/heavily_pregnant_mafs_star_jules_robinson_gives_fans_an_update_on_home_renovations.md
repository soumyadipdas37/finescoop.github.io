Jules Robinson and husband Cameron Merchant have been racing against the clock to renovate their new $1.8million home, ahead of the birth of their first child. 

And it seems that things are really coming together for the pair, who rose to fame on Married At First Sight last year.  

On Monday, Jules, 36, shared a series of images on her Instagram story giving fans an update on their renovations, including getting new wooden floors and showing off their stylish new loungeroom.

Jules shared a video of a tradesman lifting up wrapping off their wooden floors at their new home on Sydney's Northern Beaches, after having painted the walls.  

She also revealed that she and Cameron have chosen to have a bright red door.

Jules also shared a picture of their loungeroom, showing off some new fern-printed wallpaper, a grey lounge filled with pillows from Kmart and a white-washed table from Facebook Marketplace.

The redhead also shared video of another large wooden cabinet she had painted up.

'I think it's going to look fabulous, what do you think?' Jules said.

It was reported earlier this month that Jules and Cam had snapped up a $1.8million property on Sydney's Northern Beaches. 

It came after Cam sold his boutique apartment in Sydney's Kirribilli for $900,000.

The contemporary home features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a large outdoor entertaining area for their baby to play in.

The main bedroom features a built-in robe and ensuite.

The property is mere minutes away from Cam's parents, Margaret and Russell, and a short drive to Dee Why beach.  

Cameron and Jules have been racing against time to finish renovating their new property before welcoming their new addition.

To get the job done, the reality TV couple have called in renovation experts, couple Mitch Edwards and Mark McKie, from The Block.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia last month, soon-to-be-father Cam said the couple have already picked out a name for the baby, if their bundle of joy should be a girl. 

He said they decided during filming their season of MAFS last year.

'I mentioned it to Jules when we first brought up kids, and she loved it and we have gone with it.'

Cameron and Jules, who legally married in November 2019, have chosen to keep the sex of their unborn child a secret until birth.

Jules is due to give birth in a matter of weeks.
