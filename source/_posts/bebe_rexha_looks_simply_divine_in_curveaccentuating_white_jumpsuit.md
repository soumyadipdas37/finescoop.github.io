Bebe Rexha was looking simply divine on Monday.  

The pop star, 31, shared a sizzling, curve-showcasing snap onto her Instagram account.

While the outfit covered up her physique from head-to-toe, it still managed to leave very little of her body to the imagination.

White hot! Bebe Rexha shared a sizzling, curve-showcasing snap onto her Instagram account on Monday 

The skintight jumpsuit was made of semi-sheer white lace which clung to her hourglass figure, before flaring out into a bell bottom style at the trousers.

She topped up the look with a wide-brim hat atop her wavy blonde locks.

Bebe stood facing the Pacific blue, but gazed over the shoulder towards the camera, putting her perfectly made-up complexion on full show.

'I felt like this one deserved a grid post,' Bebe captioned the snap.

Bebe shared another snap from the festivities with her new boyfriend, filmmaker Keyan Safyari.

Keyan smiled adoringly at Bebe as he placed a tender hand upon her waist.

Like Bebe, Keyan was wearing all-white.

While the snap didn't make it to the grid, she did post it to her Instagram stories.

Bebe was first linked to Keyan after the duo were spotted leaving celebrity hotspot Delilah back in March.

In 2017, Bebe said she had been single since 2015.

'I haven't had a boyfriend since,' she told KISS FM UK. 'I'm an old school romantic. I don't like to just like throw my heart around or my anything else.'

Bebe has been candid about her sexual fluidity as well.

'I try to keep one thing personal to me. But I consider myself fluid. Until I find "the one," I can't just say what I am. I just want to find someone I love and who loves me — and I don't care if that's a boy or a girl,' she told Health in May 2019.
