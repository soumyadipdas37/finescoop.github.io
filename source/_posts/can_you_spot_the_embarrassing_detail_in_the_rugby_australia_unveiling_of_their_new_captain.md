Rugby Australia has decided to unveil their new Wallabies captain emblazoned with the name of their sponsor Qantas - just hours after the airline ended their 30-year association with the code.   

The Wallabies on Wednesday announced star flanker Michael Hooper has been reinstated as captain of the national rugby team in the Hunter Valley, using portrait shots of the 28-year-old wearing the famous jersey emblazoned with the Qantas logo. 

Only hours before, Qantas made the shock decision to terminate their $5 million sponsorship of the Wallabies as the coronavirus continues to cripple the airline.

Qantas chief customer officer Stephanie Tully announced on Wednesday that the long-running partnership with the national rugby union team was over, as well as sponsorship of Cricket Australia and the Football Federation of Australia.

'In an environment where thousands of our people have lost jobs and thousands more are stood down while they wait for flying to restart, we can't maintain these sponsorships in the way we have in the past,' Ms Tully said in a statement. 

'While we're dealing with this crisis and its aftermath, the cash cost of our sponsorships has to be zero.

'Qantas has had a very long association with Rugby Australia and the Wallabies, and we've stuck with each other during difficult times. Unfortunately, this pandemic has been the undoing.'

The Wallabies, who have been sponsored by Qantas since 1990 and have fragile finances from COVID-19, will now have to find a new major sponsor to step into the airline's shoes. 

Rugby Australia Interim Chief Executive Rob Clarke was saddened with Qantas' decision.

'While it is obviously disappointing to lose such a loyal partner, it is understandable given the world we are all now living in, and the challenges we are all facing,' he said in a statement.

'There aren't many 30-year partnerships in Australian sport, and I want to thank Qantas for everything they have done for our great game.

'Alan (Joyce) and his team have been transparent and collaborative in their discussions with us and they have now given us the opportunity to prepare for 2021 and beyond.'

Qantas will also not be paying any sponsorship fees to Cricket Australia and the Football Federation Australia for the next 12 months.

The cash-strapped airline will continue 'in-kind support' such as free flights and marketing before a further review takes place next year. 

Qantas will continue to support the Australian Olympic Committee and Paralympics Australia and fly both teams to the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

The changes are expected to save $20 million a year.

Ms Tully said the airline's partners had been incredibly understanding of the situation, particularly as many were facing their own COVID challenges.
