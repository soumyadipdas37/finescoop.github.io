The future Duke of Marlborough and his wife have revealed the godfathers for their newborn daughter Olympia. 

George Spencer-Churchill, the Marquess of Blandford, 28,  and interior designer Camilla Thorp, 32, welcomed daughter Olympia Arabella Kitty Spencer-Churchill earlier this month in Portland Hospital, London 

The couple have now revealed the three men chosen to act as godparents to their first child, with bloodstock consultant Sam Haggas and restaurant owner Hugh Stanley making the cut.

Meanwhile Camilla also revealed she had introduced her daughter to 'grandpa' the Duke of Marlborough, sharing a snap of the moment with her Instagram followers.

Camilla shared a group snap of the three godparents alongside George and Olympia, captioning it with a champagne glass and writing: 'The godparents.'

Among the men chosen for the role is Hugh Stanley who is the nephew of the Earl of Derby and owns plush restaurant Stanleys in Chelsea. 

He opened the eatery, which is just off the King's Road, in July of this year, with Tatler dubbing it the 'smart new restaurant where the Chelsea set will be this summer'.

The 27-year-old spent his teenage years setting up parties at Sloane Square stalwart, Tonteria, before he did a stint at nightclub Tramp and three years at The Sydney Arms.

She went on to share another pictured of the Duke of Marlborough with his tiny granddaughter, and captioned the picture: 'Loved meeting my grandpa'

Meanwhile the couple also selected bloodstock consultant Sam Haggas, who set up his own business, Hurworth Bloodstock, in February 2019. 

His father, William Haggas, is one of the most respected trainers in the headquarters of British racing in Newmarket. 

And his mother Maureen is a former jockey and trainer and the daughter of Lester Piggott, widely regarded as one of the greatest flat racing jockeys of all time. 

Finally, they chose  another close friend Mylo Sangster, who is grandson of famed horse trainer and breeder Robert Sangster.

The couple announced the news they'd welcomed a daughter to their 10,000 followers on their Instagram page last week.

, George wrote: 'Welcome to the world baby girl Olympia Arabella Kitty Spencer-Churchill,' while Camilla added: 'So in love with our little angel.'

The pair posted a collection of sweet photographs with the posts yesterday, showing the couple embracing their daughter while still in hospital. 

Newborn Olympia won't inherit the family estate and fortune because of male primogeniture, which dictates it must go to the oldest son or closest male heir.

Followers quickly flooded the comments with their best wishes for the parents, with one writing: 'She’s so gorgeous! Congratulations!'

George became Marquess of Blandford in 2014, following his grandfather's death and was named by Tatler as one of the '10 most eligible people in the land' in 2017, before his wedding.

His ties to the biggest names in British society are extensive and date back generations. 

Revealing the news to their combined 10,000 followers on their Instagram pages, Camilla said the couple were 'so in love with our little angel.'

Time for some bubbly! George treated his wife to a present following the birth of their daughter - which involved a cuddly toy and a bottle of champagne

George's great-great-grandfather, the 9th Duke of Marlborough, was a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill and was married to Consuelo Vanderbilt, of the prominent American Vanderbilt dynasty. The late Princess Diana was also George's fourth cousin, once removed.

The aristocrat and polo player lives in leafy south-west London but will one day preside over the jaw-dropping 187-room Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire.

Camilla met aviation broker and Old Harrovian George 12 years ago while holidaying in the Isle of Wight, with the two marrying in a lavish ceremony at his family seat of Blenheim Palace in September 2018. 

Camilla revealed she was pregnant with the couple’s first child in a sweet Instagram post showing the pair bottle-feeding lambs in April this year, writing: 'Getting some practise in.'

Recalling how their relationship started, Camilla told Tatler: 'One day he just started holding my hand. 

A gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, Blenheim Palace was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession.  

Since then the palace has been held in trust for Duke after Duke and is currently the home of the 12th, Jamie Spencer-Churchill.

Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site in 1987. 

The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year.

'Our parents have been friends for years, which made life much easier. We didn’t have to do the whole "meet the parents" thing.' 

George, son of James Spencer-Churchill and his first wife Rebecca Mary Few Brown, popped the question at Soho House, Istanbul, and the couple set about planning the wedding. 

Camilla, who did not hire a wedding planner, explained she had always thought she would marry at her mother's Hampshire home but that her husband-to-be 'thought it important for us to celebrate Blenheim'. 

The couple tied the knot at nearby St Mary Magdalene Church before heading back for a party beneath a marquee on the palace's South Lawn. 

Interior designer Camilla was given away by her father James, an architect. 

After the ceremony, the couple celebrated with friends and family at the palace, which is set in 2,000 acres. 

Camilla wore a Dolce & Gabanna white dress, which was the first bespoke bridal gown by the designer ever to have been worn in Britain.

As part of her bridal outfit Camilla also wore an heirloom which has been in the Marlborough family since 1895.

The diamond and pearl-encrusted Boucheron tiara, which was sewn into the bride's hair, was originally a wedding gift to Consuelo Vanderbilt, one of the 'Dollar Princesses', from her father at the time of her marriage to the 9th Duke of Marlborough.
