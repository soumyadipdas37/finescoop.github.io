Jenna Coleman and Tom Hughes were spotted on Wednesday packing up and moving out of their London home.

The actor couple shocked fans when they split in July - having been a couple - on and off-screen - for four years.

But things seemed to be made final as the Victoria stars dealt with matters at their former shared property.

Tom, 35, was spotted briefly at the door, heading inside in a black coat and maroon hat.

Jenna, 34, looked spirited enough, strolling along outside on her phone, in a sweeping tan trench coat.

She wore a pink, cream, mustard and navy sweater with sweatpants and white trainers.

She wore a natural wash of make-up and her brunette locks loosely around her shoulders.

Jenna was seen going back and forth to her parked car, loading items into the back of it. 

They were seen handing over the keys to the house a few weeks ago, with Jenna said to be 'terribly sad' after splitting from Tom.

The actress and her Victoria co-star fell in love on set while playing the lead roles of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the ITV period costume drama.

Snaps showed the star handing over keys to her ex at the door of her new pad five miles from their home. 



An insider told The Sun that the pair have since met up in an attempt to keep things 'as friendly and civil as possible.'

The source said: 'They are trying to salvage a friendship but obviously these are trying times, and it's not easy. 

'Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. There was no third party involved.  

'Jenna's career is going from strength to strength, she's being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she's still young.'
