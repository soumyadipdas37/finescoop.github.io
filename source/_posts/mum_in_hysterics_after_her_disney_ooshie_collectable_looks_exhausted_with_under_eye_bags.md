An Australian mother has been left in hysterics after being gifted an Anna from Frozen Ooshie collectible that had visible eye bags and 'looked exhausted'.

The woman, who lives on Queensland's Gold Coast, posted a photo of a regular Anna miniature and compared it to the one she received, citing some visible differences.

'Anna before and after the ball... even princesses wake up with bags,' she captioned the image.

Plenty of parents said the abnormal Anna looked 'wrecked' or compared her to being the epitome of 2020, while others said it looked like a case of 'Instagram vs reality' - a play on how people look different on their social media accounts.

'This is before and after you have kids. Thanks for the laugh,' said one lady.

'Now THAT is what I would call a rare Ooshie,' said another.

A third added: 'There clearly hasn't been any quality control here'.  

The 36 Disney+ fan favourites landed in Woolworths stores on Wednesday August 26, featuring iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar.

Customers can retrieve one Ooshies collectable for every $30 they spend in stores - but there are some 'participating brands' you can buy from that will give you bonus toys.

These brands include Uncle Toby's, Tip Top, Oral B, Huggies, Sorbent, Woolworths Macro Organic and McCain, and there is no price limit on what you can buy.

Every week, the supermarket will nominate selected products from its catalogue that are eligible for a bonus Disney Plus Ooshie collectable.  

'If a customer purchases five products from one participating brand, they will receive five bonus Ooshies,' a Woolworths spokesperson told FEMAIL.

The spokesperson confirmed shoppers will be limited to five items per shop for any eligible bonus brand. 

Last year, shoppers found a loophole to score more than 10 Lion King Ooshies for just $30 after their grocery bill included selected items such as $2 hand washes and $1.80 cat food.

The new Ooshies feature iconic characters like Darth Vader, Elsa, Buzz Lightyear, Thor, Ariel, Yoda, Black Panther and Moana. 

 Customers can score more than one themed figurine in a single transaction if they buy selected products from participating brands

The collection includes silver, gold, colour changing, glow in the dark, and additional glitter edition Ooshies, which can all be kept in a limited-edition box.

'We know many Aussie families have had a challenging year, so we're partnering with Disney to give our customers something exciting to look forward to from their everyday shop,' Woolworths chief marketing officer Andrew Hicks said earlier this week.

'Whether it's Woody, a hologram Princess Leia or a glow in the dark Yoda, we're confident the collection is something the entire family can enjoy and collect together.'
