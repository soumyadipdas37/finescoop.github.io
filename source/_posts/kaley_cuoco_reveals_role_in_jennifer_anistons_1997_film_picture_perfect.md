She became a huge star thanks to the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory.

But long before she was famous, Kaley Cuoco was just another child actress dreaming of hitting the big time.

On Wednesday, Cuoco shared with fans via Instagram that one of her very first roles was in the Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy Picture Perfect that was released in 1997. 

'One of the first 'parts' I was cast in': Long before she was famous for The Big Bang Theory, Kaley Cuoco was a child actress. On Wednesday she shared a 'full circle moment' on Instagram

Cuoco is in New York to resume filming on her HBO Max series the Flight Attendant.

And a little serendipity occurred as she arrived at the production location Wednesday.

Sharing a photo of herself standing next to a poster for Picture Perfect, the actress wrote: 'First day at our new stages.. walked to my dressing room and what movie poster do I see framed right outside my door? ‘Picture Perfect’ starring @jenniferaniston .. little known fact this was one of the first ‘parts’ I was ever cast in as a kid.'

Big screen role: Aniston, who had been catapulted to global stardom in 1994 for her role as Rachel on the sitcom Friends, starred in the rom-com with Jay Mohr and Kevin Bacon

Starting out: 'I was the last name in the credits (credited as ‘little girl’).. when I saw the movie , they had cut my one line, but all I remember is spending the entire day convincing myself to tell Jen how much I loved her,' Cuoco shared on Instagram (pictured in Picture Perfect age 12)

She went on: 'I was the last name in the credits (credited as ‘little girl’).. when I saw the movie , they had cut my one line, but all I remember is spending the entire day convincing myself to tell Jen how much I loved her. (Friends was my life at that point).'

Aniston had been cast as Rachel in NBC sitcom friends in 1994 and the tremendous success of the show brought a string of movie offers her way.

Cuoco recalled that even though Aniston had become a huge star, 'she was a gem to me then and a gem to me now (and to everyone she knows).' 

She reflected: 'funny to see this full circle moment. You never know where life will take you , or who’s life you will touch along the way.'
