A doctor has shut down coronavirus conspiracy theorists with a factual review debunking a popular post on social media.

Dr Sara Hassan uploaded a picture of a misinformed analysis of COVID-19 deaths on her Facebook page on Sunday.

The post claims only six per cent of America's 153,504 coronavirus deaths were actually caused by COVID-19, as 94 per cent of deaths had additional causes of death along with the deadly disease.

'I'm getting on this early because this type of misinformation and outright deliberate mischaracterisation of the facts is already making the rounds amongst conspiracy theorists hell-bent on twisting facts to suit their agenda,' Dr Hassan's post reads.

The post (pictured) claimed those with who died from additional causes of death could not be included in the coronavirus death tally

'Those who spread these mistruths have one intention: to attempt to throw doubt about COVID deaths, minimise the seriousness of the pandemic, and ultimately encourage people to revolt against any mitigation put in place to prevent further deaths.'

Dr Hassan said the misinformed post came from a chiropractor in America, who claimed having co-morbidity on a death certificate meant the deaths could not be attributed to coronavirus.

The Melbourne mother said the death certificates had not been properly completed and falsely using data from the Centre for Disease and Control was dangerous.

'Such outrageous, ignorant and patently false claims are now spreading through social media by bored conspiracy theorists with a serious case of 'Stuckhome Syndrome',' she said. 

It is well known that those with pre-existing health issues are more susceptible to coronavirus than others, with 67 per cent of Australia's coronavirus fatalities having one or more underlying co-morbidity.

Dr Hassan said the post highlighted a horrific figure while trying to provide deceptive information on COVID-19.

'Instead of downplaying the seriousness of COVID, which is their sinister aim, the fact that six per cent of COVID victims had absolutely no underlying pre-existing condition is terrifying,' her post reads.

'They were relatively healthy individuals and they STILL succumbed to this wildly infectious and unpredictable disease.'

Dr Hassan's post received a wealth of supportive comments from her followers.

'Please keep up the truth telling even if some don't like it,' one comment reads.

'I am so grateful for your information,' another post reads. 'It makes me feel more confident in my decisions through this pandemic.'
