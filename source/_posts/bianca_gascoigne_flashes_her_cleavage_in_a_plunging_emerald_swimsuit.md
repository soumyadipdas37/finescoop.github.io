It was a case of bottom's up for Bianca Gascoigne as she swigged from a champagne bottle while relaxing in a hot tub on Tuesday. 

The step-daughter of football legend Paul Gascoigne made the most of Britain's unseasonably hot September temperatures while taking part in her latest photoshoot.  

Dressed in a plunging green swimsuit, she appeared to be enjoying herself during a welcome break on location at Cedar Hollow in Oxford's Shotover Country Park.

With the picturesque venue's rural scenery serving as a backdrop, Bianca, 33, raised the large champagne magnum to her lips while dipping her legs into the warm water. 

Sharing the shot with her 318,000 Instagram followers, she wrote: 'As you were.'  

Earlier that day Bianca displayed her assets in the plunging barely-there emerald number as she posed up a storm.

She showed off her toned legs in a pair of knee-high white leather cowboy boots for the sizzling photographs taken on the porch of a white house.

Bianca wore her trademark blonde tresses in flirty curls round her shoulders and opted for a typically glamorous makeup look.

She looked as confident as ever as she worked her best angles for the sultry new shots.

Bianca's shoot comes after she returned from Croatia on her first holiday with her beau Kris Boyson earlier this month. 

The reality star recently revealed she moved in with her personal trainer boyfriend after their first date in a interview. 

The couple took their relationship to the next level as they spent the UK's nationwide lockdown together just weeks after embarking on a romance.

Despite dating for only five months, the reality stars admitted they'd definitely want to get married and start a family in the future as they 'completely trust' each other. 

Katie Price's ex told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. 

'You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.'  

Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out. 

They lost contact for a while, before fitness enthusiast Kris slid into her Instagram DMs earlier this year. 

The couple currently reside in Kent and are renovating their pad with a cinema room and a new bar. 

When asked about the prospect of marriage and kids, influencer Bianca admitted their future looks 'very promising' and her mother Sheryl Gascoigne is 'desperate for grandchildren'.
