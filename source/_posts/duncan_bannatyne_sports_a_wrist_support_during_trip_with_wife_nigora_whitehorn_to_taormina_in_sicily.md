He's been enjoying a sun-soaked holiday in Sicily, Italy, with wife Nigora Whitehorn. 

And, Duncan Bannatyne, 71, sported a grey wrist support to help ease the pain of his arthritis, during a trip to the stunning hilltop town of Taormina, on Monday.

The Dragon's Den star took to Instagram to share a snap of himself sitting on steps surrounded by artwork, while sporting a greying beard and colourful shorts, but it was his wrist support which drew most attention.

Duncan smiled in the snap as he sat on the stone snaps, while clad in a vibrant pair of blue and pink shorts.

The businessman pared back the rest of his attire, opting for a plain black T-shirt and a grey pair of slip on shoes. 

Duncan shielded his eyes with a quirky pair of shades and captioned the social media post: 'Wanna buy a painting?'

At the end of last month, Duncan explained to Daily Mail why he's been wearing a wrist brace, saying: 'It's a form of wrist arthritis.

'It's uncomfortable, but I've got a wrist support and I need to wear it for a week and then it should be gone.'

The sports club owner, whose wealth as of 2018 was estimated at £280 million, added: 'I'm still maintaining my fitness — everyone should.'

MailOnline has contacted Duncan Bannatyne's representatives for comment. 

Last week, Duncan's Influencer wife Nigora refused to stay at a luxury Italian three star hotel after branding it 'filthy and disgusting.'

The TV star moved his wife out of the accommodation and into a five star retreat after she warned her 24K Instagram followers against staying at the 'disappointing' Italian villa.  

Nigora is Duncan's third wife, after previously tying the knot with Gail Brodie and Joanne McCue, in 1987 and 2006 respectively.

Thrice-wed Duncan has four children with Gail and two with Joanna. Uzbekistan-born Nigora is also a parent to daughter Gabrielle from a former relationship.

Speaking to This Morning shortly after exchanging vows, the billionaire businessman didn't rule out the possibility of having more children, saying: 'We'll be planning the future family. I would like to have at least two boys. I can't wait to be a dad again.'

Nigora also conveyed why she wants to expand her family with Duncan, adding: 'He's an amazing father.

'I'm proud of how he is with my daughter. She adores Duncan and couldn't ask for better stepfather. He's going to be an amazing father to my future children.'

Duncan and Nigora married in Portugal, where the couple share a home, after a two-year courtship.
