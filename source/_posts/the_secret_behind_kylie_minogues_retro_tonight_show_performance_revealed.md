Kylie Minogue stunned fans this week with a retro themed performance of her new single Say Something on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

The rendition featured an array of vintage special effects that made it appear as if Kylie was performing in the 1970s or '80s. 

After it aired, fans flocked to YouTube to praise the star for her nostalgic retro concept.

Another wrote: 'Omg doesn't she look amazing. Proper 80s vibe disco effects.'

'Wow, finally she is giving us a different visual aesthetic,' exclaimed another.

Kylie later took to Twitter to reveal the secrets behind the retro performance.

'I wasn’t born in the 70s, but I bet this is how 70s television felt like. What a great performance!' gushed one fan 

Not only did she use a green screen for the effects, she also filmed the performance with an old 1980s BBC news camera.

To ensure she looked the part, Kylie donned a vintage Antony Price dress from 1983.

Last month, the Princess of Pop detailed her experience filming the music video for her new single Say Something entirely in front of a green screen amid COVID-19 restrictions.

'It was a different shoot with the restrictions but it felt good to be back on set,' the songstress told The Herald Sun.

In the clip, Kylie rides a horse statue as a salute to Bianca Jagger, who famously rode a white horse on the Studio 54 dance floor.

'The horse was the star of the show. I don't think my galactic steed was designed to be ridden, but I fell in love with him, he was gorgeous,' she said.

'I hope when people see it, it takes them to another level and away to wherever their happy place is.'

Kylie will release her fifteenth studio album Disco on November 6.
