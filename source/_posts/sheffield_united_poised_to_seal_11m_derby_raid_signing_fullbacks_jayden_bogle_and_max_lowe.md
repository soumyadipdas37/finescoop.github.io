Sheffield United are finalising the £11million double signing of Derby County full backs Jayden Bogle and Max Lowe.

Manager Chris Wilder will also bring in Scotland forward Oliver Burke this week as part of a swap deal with West Bromwich Albion for Callum Robinson.

Both Lowe, 23, and Bogle, 20, who had interest from West Ham and Fulham, were left out of Derby's squad that faced Barrow in the Carabao Cup on Saturday.

Sheffield United are set to sign a pair of Derby County full-backs, including Jayden Bogle 

Max Lowe forms the other half of the pairing, signing for a combined £11m from the second tier

Chris Wilder is aiming to strengthen after a stunning return to the Premier League last season

Burke and Robinson are currently away on international duty and will finalise their transfer once they return.

Meanwhile, West Brom have signed Brighton goalkeeper David Button on a two-year deal. 

The Englishman made just 11 appearances in two appearances on the south-coast, and will move north as backup to first-choice Sam Johnstone. 

Oliver Burke is also set for a move to the Blades this summer form West Bromwich Albion
