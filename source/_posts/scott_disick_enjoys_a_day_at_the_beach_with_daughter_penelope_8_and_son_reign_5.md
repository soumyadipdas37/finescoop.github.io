Scott Disick looked every bit the doting dad as he hung out on the beach with daughter Penelope, eight, and son Reign, five, on Saturday afternoon in Malibu.

The 37-year-old Talentless founder donned a stylish tie-dyed button down and a pair of bleach-dyed shorts for their outing.

Meanwhile, Disick's baby mama Kourtney Kardashian, 41, grabbed lunch down the road with Tik Tok star Addison Rae, 19.

Scott kept his brunette hair concealed beneath a backwards cap as he walked the shore with two out of his three children by his side.

Penelope looked undeniably adorable in a monochromatic ensemble that consisted of a black tee and some shorts.

Reign, rocking his newly trimmed mohawk, had on a plain white t-shirt and a pair of black board shorts. 

The trio remained on the beach until the sun set before heading back to their oceanside rental property.

Though he did not share any photos from their day at the beach, Scott did upload a photo of himself and Reign riding in a luxury SUV to his Instagram page on Saturday.

'Killing it,' captioned Disick as his youngest son climbed on the vehicle's white leather seats.

Kourtney, who spends most of her time with her children, appeared to be enjoying herself as she dined with her new BFF Addison.

Addison uploaded a brief video of Kardashian to her Instagram that showed the POOSH founder wiggling a pair of sunglasses up and down on her face.

On her personal page, Kourtney reposted Addison's video and uploaded a slew of scenic shots taken from the balcony of her rented Malibu beach house.

Before uploading the sweet snap, Kourtney drew a heart around her children with her finger via the app's 'draw' feature.

Scott has been spending a ton of time with ex Kourtney and their children in recent months following his split from girlfriend of three-years Sofia Richie, 22, in May. 

Kourtney and Scott, who split in 2015 after nine-years together, not only share Penelope and Reign, but also 10-year-old son Mason.

Despite all of their bonding time, sources close to the former pair refuted all claims that they planned to rekindle their romance to TMZ.

Scott briefly reconnected with Sofia as they attended a Fourth Of July party in Malibu together.

But, shortly after, the pair split 'for good' and a source told Us Weekly at the time that their '15-year age difference' may have been an issue.   

'He's in a very much different place in his life, really focused on a more quiet lifestyle, his kids and his investment businesses and Sofia, at 21 years old, is really still trying to figure what she wants to do, which drove them apart over time,' they explained to the outlet.
