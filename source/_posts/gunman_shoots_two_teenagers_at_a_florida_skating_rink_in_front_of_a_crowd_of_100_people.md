Lt Ryan Schorer, with the Melbourne police, told Florida Today the victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. No one else was harmed in the incident.

Police were reviewing surveillance video from the skating rink and believe the gunman purportedly targeted at least one of the victims.

According to investigators, the promoter of the event had at least one security guard at the scene at the time of the shooting.

'If they’re hosting a crowd, then they’re required to get a permit,' Schorer said. 'We’re just glad there were no significant injuries.'

As of Monday morning, no arrests have been made in connection to the shooting.
