Manchester United only need two more signings to complete their team according to former player Dimitar Berbatov.

The former Bulgaria international believes the Red Devils need to sign a centre back and a right back despite Ole Gunar Solskjaer's side splashing £130m on centre-half Harry Maguire and right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka last summer.

United have been in hot pursuit of Jadon Sancho and some believe they still need to buy a centre forward but Berbatov disagrees.

'For United I think they only need two, in my opinion: a centre-back and a right-back,' Berbatov told the MEN. 'The priority for me is a centre-back and then the team will be pretty much complete, in my opinion.' 

'The striker needs to be really exceptional [if United move for one] but don't go and buy just for the sake of buying. You have enough strike power. Some people can argue they need a more experienced striker around the young strikers at the moment, which is a good point, actually. But who is that going to be?

'Because then you need to keep him happy as well, and at the moment you have Ighalo in that position in that role if you want it like this.'

So is there a specific striker suitable for United? 'Yes,' Berbatov replied. 'Myself! Ha ha ha.

'From the top of my head, no, because I really like Rashford and Martial, I really do, and what I saw from Greenwood last season, he deserves his playing time. He's earned it.

'And if they put Sancho in that picture then we'll have a great young line-up of strikers who can develop in the time and become even better.' 

United have been in hot pursuit of Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho this summer

United are ready to negotiate a price for Sancho with Borussia Dortmund after reaching a compromise with the player's camp over the terms of a five-year contract.

United ended weeks of stalemate on Wednesday when they made a breakthrough in talks over Sancho's wages and the agents' fees.

Sportsmail understands they are ready to hand Sancho a contract that will run until 2025 with United having the option to extend it by another 12 months.
