A glamour model was found unconscious behind the wheel of her pink Mercedes less than five months after she was caught driving with drugs in her system. 

Wethbet Almaali, who also goes by the name Lara Dior, was spotted in the unregistered vehicle with illegal diamante stickers on the expired number plate in Sydney's Sans Souci on May 5. 

The car was still running when a passer-by noticed she was unconscious with 50 Xanax tablets in the passenger's footwell.

When police arrived they struggled to wake the hairdresser for some time, the Sutherland Local Court heard on Tuesday. 

'She was slurring her words, was struggling to stay sitting upright in the car and had red glassy eyes,' police stated. 

'The accused failed to maintain a steady level of consciousness and could not hold a conversation.'

As officers attempted to arrest her after she refused a breath test, she turned violent and began kicking and screaming, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Almaali was convicted and fined $700 for the incident. She has been disqualified from driving for three months. It will be the sixth time she has been disqualified from driving

Almaali pleaded guilty to drug driving, using an unregistered vehicle, driving unlicensed and having defaced number plates on Tuesday.

She also pleaded guilty to refusing to submit to a breath test.

Almaali was convicted and fined $700 for the incident. She has been disqualified from driving for three months. 

It will be the sixth time she has been disqualified from driving.

In December last year, Almaali was caught driving with cocaine and methylamphetamine in her system in Gregory Hills.

She has also wracked up 10 speeding fines which cost her $1249 and 35 demerit points over the years.
