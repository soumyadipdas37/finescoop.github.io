She has been enjoying a sun-drenched romantic getaway with her fiancé Oliver Cheshire. 

And Pixie Lott flaunted her sensational figure in a nautical navy striped swimsuit as she posed at the side of the poolside in front of the stunning Kefalonian coastline. 

The singer, 29, displayed her incredibly-toned pins in the high-leg ensemble during her luxurious stay at the Emelisse Nature Resort in Fiskardo, Greece, on Sunday.

Captioning the idyllic snap on Instagram, she wrote: 'Off for a dip in this beautiful place'

Showcasing her natural beauty, the Cry Me Out hitmaker looked radiant as she went makeup-free by the poolside to accentuate her sun-kissed glow. 

The star swept her blonde locks up into a tousled bun which she kept in place with a black scrunchie. 

A barefoot Pixie highlighted her peachy posterior in the retro swimsuit which featured a low-cut back and crossover strap detail. 

Special moments: Pixie proved her summer wasn't entirely wasted on Thursday as she gave fans an update on her romantic Greek holiday with model Oliver Cheshire

Captioning the snap on Instagram, she wrote: 'Off for a dip in this beautiful place.' 

Earlier this week Oliver, 32, revealed his tanned torso by going shirtless while planting a kiss on Pixie's cheek as they relaxed on the shoreline of the Greek island.  

Captioning the image he reluctantly admitted their holiday was almost over, telling fans: 'Last few days of playing Crusoe.' 

Separate shots posted by Pixie revealed the sweeping coastline in all its glory, with the star capturing clear blue horizons and colourful orange sunsets from her above ground vantage point.   

Right decision: Pixie has made the most of relaxed travel restrictions by jetting to the Greek Islands with her hunky fiancé

The wedding to her model beau has been affected due to the coronavirus pandemic, so they have decided to wait and resume planning when lockdown restrictions have lifted completely.  

She said in an interview with The Sun:  'I’m a big family girl, a very big family girl. Family is everything for me so I would love to have my own family when I can find the time. When the time is right I would love that. It’s such an amazing thing to have. 

'We were planning to have our wedding this year and now ­everything is so up in the air, we’ve just delayed it.

'There’s still a lot of planning behind the scenes but we are waiting for the time there are no restrictions and rules, because we don’t really want to have that on the special day.' 

Beautiful: Rounding off her set of updates from Greece on Thursday Pixie shared a selfie, her naturally pretty features accentuated by subtle touches of make-up
