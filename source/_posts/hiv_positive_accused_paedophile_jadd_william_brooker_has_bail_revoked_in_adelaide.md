An accused paedophile has had his bail revoked after he allegedly 'expressed an intention to infect children with HIV'.

Jadd William Brooker, 38, has been charged with multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material between December 2015 and August this year.

Police have allegedly identified potential victims in Australia, Canada and Italy.

Brooker, who lives in Glenelg East, South Australia, was granted bail on Thursday at Christies Beach Magistrates Court in Adelaide.

He was ordered to live with his grandmother in home detention until his next court appearance.

This is was despite police gathering evidence which allegedly showed that Brooker, who is HIV positive, intended to infect children and adults with the disease.  

However the Supreme Court overturned the decision to release the alleged paedophile on bail on Friday, remanding him in custody until April next year. 

Jadd William Brooker, 38, has been charged with multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material between December 2015 and August this year 

On Friday, the Supreme Court overturned the decision to release Brooker on bail 

Brooker allegedly pursued 19 children for sex over apps like Skype and Telegram and had ongoing sexual relationships with two teenage girls.

One of the girls has since killed herself, while the other had no idea Brooker was HIV positive and is awaiting test results.     

Police insist that this is just the beginning of their case against Brooker after seizing his phones, computers and hard drives which allegedly contained 4.5million images. 

Officers have viewed 350,000 photos so far, with 10,000 of them allegedly depicting child exploitation. A further 7,000 mages did not even 'exist' on the internet.    

'These images are certainly of the most heinous nature (and) the allegations are extremely serious in respect to (the interstate teen), prosecutor Lucy Boord told the court, Adelaide Now reported.

'There is footage of unprotected sexual interaction with that child, who is now having to be tested.'

Police allege one of the teenagers Brooker allegedly had sex with did not know he was HIV positive

 Police are also investigating a massive 50,000 messages from Brooker's devices

Police are also investigating 50,000 messages from Brooker's devices finding 'eight or nine additional, unidentified potential victims'. 

When he was contacted in prison by his mother she volunteered to delete Brooker's Facebook account and he asked her to wipe other accounts for him, the court heard.

Brooker allegedly provided his email and password for his Microsoft Live account and asked his mother to delete it. 

'Given the nature of the charges, a lot of potential evidence is stored in the cloud – potentially millions of pieces of evidence – and this is an attempt to destroy it before police can uncover it,' police prosecutors said.  

Despite the warnings from police Magistrate Rodney Oates granted bail as he had no prior criminal history, no breaches of bail and the presumption of innocence. 

Brooker is yet to plead to multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material. 

Brooker has had his bail revoked and will be remanded in custody until April next year
