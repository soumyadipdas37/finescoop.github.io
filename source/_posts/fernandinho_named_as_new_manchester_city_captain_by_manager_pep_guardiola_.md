Fernandinho has been confirmed as Manchester City's new club captain by manager Pep Guardiola. 

The Brazilian takes over from David Silva, who left the club this summer after 10 years at the club and who himself took over Vincent Kompany the season before.

The City boss revealed the decision to hand the 35-year-old was made collectively by himself, players and the backroom staff.

The midfielder was often the on-pitch captain last season as Silva saw less playing time and Guardiola has no doubt of his ability to step into the role full-time.

'He will be good, as he always has done since I met him,' said the Man City manager. 

'Sometimes I have captains, it doesn't matter with the armband, being the first captain, he is always a guy who leads in the bad moments.' 

'We decided in the locker room - the players, the backroom staff - we decided that Fernandinho is captain and I am more than delighted with that.' 

Fernandinho, who joined the club from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was one of three 'assistant' captains last season along with Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero.

The usually deep-lying midfielder played much of last season as a defender after City's trouble with injuries.

It remains to be seen whether he will revert to his usual midfield position this season as Guardiola continues his search for a new central defender.

The north-west club open their 2020-21 campaign against Wolves on Monday night.
