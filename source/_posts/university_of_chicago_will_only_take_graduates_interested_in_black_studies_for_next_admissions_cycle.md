The University of Chicago's English Department declared it will only accept applicants interested in 'working in and with Black studies' for its 2020-2021 graduate admissions cycle.  

In a statement uploaded to the English department's website in July, the faculty announced their commitment to the 'struggle of Black and indigenous people, and all racialized and dispossessed people, against inequality and brutality'.  

'For the 2020-2021 graduate admissions cycle, the University of Chicago English Department is accepting only applicants interested in working in and with Black studies,' the statement adds.

'We understand Black studies to be a capacious intellectual project that spans a variety of methodological approaches, fields, geographical areas, languages and time periods.' 

English as a subject, the department says, has provided 'aesthetic rationalizations for colonization, exploitation, extraction and anti-Blackness'. 

The statement goes on to deem the 'collective responsibility' of the faculty to be 'undoing persistent, recalcitrant anti-Blackness in our disciplines and in our institutions.'

The statement was written in July as protests against police violence tore across the US.

Earlier in the statement, the faculty says they believe that 'Black Lives Matter, and that the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and Rayshard Brooks matter, as do thousands of others named and unnamed who have been subject to police violence.' 

Gerald McSwiggan, a university spokesman told Fox News that the department 'saw a need' to focus doctoral admissions on those wishing to focus on Black Studies this year. 

McSwiggan added that the department has had to accept a limited number of students due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
