A tricky emoji quiz has been designed to put the internet's knowledge of the decades biggest chart-toppers to the test.

UK-based Buzz Bingo used a series of pictures to hint at the names of 20 songs that are currently viral on Chinese video-sharing app TikTok.

With over 800million active users in 141 countries, TikTok was the most downloaded non-game on Apple and Google Play Store combined during lockdown.

However, even those who use the app may struggle to achieve a full score on the quiz, unless they have extensive knowledge of music across multiple genres. So, do you think you can name all of the songs?
