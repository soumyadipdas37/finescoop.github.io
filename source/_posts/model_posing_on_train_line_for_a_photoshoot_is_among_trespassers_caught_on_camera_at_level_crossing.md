The photos were taken on Network Rail cameras, and were released by the train operator to the public to raise awareness about safety on the railway.

According to a spokesman, the incident captured could have resulted in 'fatal or life-changing consequence'.

Ronnie Gallagher, from Network Rail, said: 'We have noticed a significant increase in use at public footpaths since the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions.

'People have been walking longer distances and many will be using level crossings for the first time.

'It is important that you concentrate, follow the instructions and only cross when there are no trains approaching.'
