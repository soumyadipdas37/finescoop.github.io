She recently split with Ciarran Stott after a tumultuous romance on Bachelor In Paradise.

And this week, Kiki Morris was all business as she got glammed up for a photoshoot to promote Stax activewear.

The 33-year-old showed off her incredible figure in a variety of tight outfits from the brand.

The blonde beauty posed up a storm and flaunted her curves for the cameras.

In addition to diet and exercise, Kiki has turned to other methods to maintain her flawless physique.

In footage shared to her Instagram Stories earlier this month, the reality star underwent a non-surgical Brazilian Butt Lift to 'zap the fat' on her derrière and thighs.

Wearing a white T-shirt and a black G-string, a beautician was seen using a Cavitation machine to firm the skin around her buttocks and the front of her thighs.

The procedure, which she had done at Beautylicious by Sophie, costs $360. 

At least four sessions are recommended to not only sculpt the buttocks, but also migrate fat to the area and assist in the reduction of cellulite.

It all comes about eight months after Kiki had her heart broken by love rat Ciarran.

Kiki and Ciarran had started dating on the third season of Bachelor in Paradise, which was filmed in Fiji late last year.

Right before the finale, Ciarran told Kiki he was in love with her and wanted them to leave the show together without going through the formality of a rose ceremony.

Unfortunately, the couple split just a few weeks after returning to Australia.

Ciarran, who rose to fame on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette, apparently 'ghosted' Kiki and moved from Sydney to Melbourne.
