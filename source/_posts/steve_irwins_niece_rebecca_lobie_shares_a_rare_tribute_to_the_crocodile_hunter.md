Steve Irwin's niece Rebecca Lobie shared a touching tribute to her late uncle on Friday.

The 32-year-old commemorated the 14th anniversary of Steve's death by posting a photo to Instagram of the legendary conservationist holding a young crocodile.

'14 years ago today. I remember this day like it was yesterday,' she wrote in the caption.

'A beautiful soul is never forgotten,' she added.

Steve, known to millions around the world as 'The Crocodile Hunter', died in September 2006 at the age of 44 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming a wildlife documentary in Batt Reef, Queensland.

Rebecca is the daughter of Frank Muscillo, who is married to Steve's sister Joy.

Rebecca was previously the managing director of the Irwin family business, Australia Zoo, but left in December 2015.

She is rumoured to be estranged from the family, including her once-close cousin Bindi Irwin.

Rebecca has made a name for herself recently by sharing racy posts showing off her curves in skimpy outfits to Instagram.

The anniversary of Steve's death comes as the Irwin family awaits the arrival of Bindi Irwin's first child with her husband, Chandler Powell.

Bindi, 22, announced her pregnancy last month by sharing a photo to Instagram of herself and Chandler, 23, holding a tiny version of the Australia Zoo uniform.

'Baby Wildlife Warrior due 2021. Chandler and I are proud to announce that we're expecting!' she told her followers.

'It's an honour to share this special moment in our lives with you. Though I'm still in my first trimester, we really want you to be part of our journey from the beginning of this new life chapter.

'We couldn't wait to share the news as this beautiful little being has become the most important part of our lives. Your support means the world to us.

'Please let me know your best advice and send good vibes and prayers to our little sweetheart. Love and light.'

Bindi was just eight years old when her father was killed.
