An eight months pregnant woman was rescued after trying to swim across the Rio Grande river from Mexico into the US.

The mother-to-be and her partner tried to cross to the United States through the river in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico, Sunday. 

The desperate couple swam until they could no longer continue their way and had to cling to a pillar supporting the International Bridge Number Two until they were rescued.

Footage shows the couple scrambling out of the water after being rescued by Instituto Nacional de Migración officials.

A group of people saw them and asked for the support of emergency services, who responded quickly. 

The couple were brought back to safety on the Mexican side of the border. 

In the video, the couple step out of the water in the dead of night with the help of the firemen and migration officials.

The three INAMI officials help the woman out of the water and she is given a shock blanket when she reaches dry land.

The Rio Grande in the United States, is a natural border between Mexico and the United States. 

This river has been the crossing route for massive migrations of people from South American countries trying to get to the US by any means necessary.

Many migrants have died in the area including a father who was tragically found dead next to his daughter on the side of the river in 2019.

A child was found dead that same year after trying to cross in search of a better life.
