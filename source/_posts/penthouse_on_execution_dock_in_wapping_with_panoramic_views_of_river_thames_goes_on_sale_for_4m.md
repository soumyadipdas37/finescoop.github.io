This stunning penthouse on Execution Dock on the banks of the River Thames in London could be yours for a tidy £4million - provided you can handle its gory history.

The top floor apartment in the boutique-style converted warehouse in Wapping's Pierhead conservation area offers stunning panoramic views, but would have once overlooked the site of public hangings which ceased there in 1830.

Execution Dock was used for more than 400 years to put to death pirates, smugglers and mutineers found guilty in the Admiralty courts. The 'dock' consisted of a scaffold used for hanging. 

These days the area is a stone's throw from chic independent coffee shops, riverside pubs and the affluent St Katharine Docks Marina by the Tower of London.

Execution Dock, located near the shoreline at Wapping in east London, was used for more than 400 years to put to death pirates, smugglers and mutineers found guilty in the Admiralty courts

Execution Dock, located near the shoreline at Wapping within the East End of Central London, was used for more than 400 years to put to death pirates, smugglers and mutineers found guilty in the Admiralty courts.

The British Admiralty's legal jurisdiction was for all crimes committed at sea. 

The dock symbolised that jurisdiction by being located just beyond the low-tide mark in the river. 

Anybody who had committed crimes on the seas, either in home waters or abroad, would eventually be brought back to London and tried by the High Court of the Admiralty.

Offenders were hung in front of huge crowds, their plight worsened by the use of shortened rope, which meant they died from suffocation instead of a broken neck, according to Historic UK.

The organisation said the bodies remained suspended until three tides had washed over them.

One of the most famous pirates to be put to death here was the inspiration for Treasure Island - Scottish sailor Captain Kidd. He was hanged in 1701, after being tried for piracy on his return from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. 

Some modern historians, including Sir Cornelius Neale Dalton, deem his piratical reputation unjust.
