A hot pink mansion inspired by luxury Italian fashion brand Versace has hit the market.

The five-bedroom residence on Queens Court in Castle Hill, Sydney's north-western suburbs, was built in 2005 after it sold for $1.4million in 2004.

The extravagant abode has been decked out with chandeliers, gold-painted walls and ornaments in honour of Versace's distinct style.

'Perfectly located in a quiet cul-de-sac, this family home has everything on your wish list,' the property's listing reads. 

According to realestate.com.au, the home is estimated to sell for between $2.1m and $2.6m when it goes to auction.

The property also comes with two full bathrooms, including one with a spa bath, and a powder room with a shower 

'It's definitely caught people's attention. I think what's captured people is the colour scheme … I can't recall ever selling a house anything like this before,' he said. 

Mr Cutcliffe said the seller was strongly interested in style. 

'It's an incredibly stylish house. For a suburban house, it has grand proportions that make it stand out.' 

One of the five bedrooms is a 'master suite' and comes equipped with a walk-in wardrobe. 

There is an upstairs office with a skylight and the house's gourmet kitchen comes with granite benchtops and an oversized oven.

The property is six minutes from Castle Towers and five minutes from the Sydney Metro. For families with teenagers, the house falls into the zone for Castle Hill High School.
