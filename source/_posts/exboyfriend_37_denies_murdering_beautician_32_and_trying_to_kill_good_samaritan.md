A man has appeared in court to deny murdering his ex-partner and trying to kill Good Samaritan 'who stepped in' during knife attack. 

Melissa Belshaw, 32, was found with 'catastrophic' injuries after being stabbed at her home in Orrell, Greater Manchester, on May 20. 

A man in his 40s, who is thought to have tried to intervene during the attack, was also left in a serious condition.  

Ms Belshaw's former partner Andrew Wadsworth, 37, denies murder, attempted murder, and making threats to kill.

Melissa Belshaw, 32, (pictured) was found with 'catastrophic' injuries after being stabbed at her home in Orrell, Greater Manchester, on May 20 

The mother-of-one, who worked as a beautician, was attacked just before 4.10pm at her home.

Her 13-year-old daughter, who had been in the house at the time, rang the emergency services to raise the alarm. 

But Ms Belshaw was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later despite the efforts of paramedics. 

Wadsworth, of Cranfield Road, Wigan, appeared at Manchester Crown Court via video link yesterday. 

He entered not guilty pleas to the charges with a three-week trial now scheduled to start on November 16.

More than 500 mourners had lined the streets to say their last goodbyes to Ms Belshaw in June.

A horse-drawn carriage took Ms Belshaw's coffin from her mother's home in Wigan to Gidlow Cemetery.

But only ten loved ones where allowed to attend the short service due to coronavirus lockdown restrictions at the time.
