She has walked the runway for Victoria Secret and has posed for the likes of Vogue, Marie Claire and Harper's Bazaar. 

And on Wednesday, Georgia Fowler revealed the secrets behind her flawless skin. 

Appearing on the Mamamia podcast You Beauty the 28-year-old explained that she never thought about skincare until she got older. 

So that's how she does it! On Thursday, model Georgia Fowler (pictured) revealed the secret behind her flawless skin to Mamamia podcast, You Beauty

'Growing up I didn't do much, you know I was brought up in New Zealand, and my mum was very no fuss and only used one moisturiser,' she said.   

'I learnt, obviously being in the modelling industry and having makeup artist and professionals working on my skin all day and every day, what products I should use...'

The New Zealand beauty said that she credits her skin to a number of beauty products from cleansers to sunscreen.

Georgia's favourite cleanser is the Royal Fern Cleansing Balm which retails for $114 as it 'gives a nice cleanse without drying out your skin too much'.

She also said that she uses an exfoliant everyday, to help with 'blackheads and any impurities'. 

When it comes to her favourite serum, the model revealed that her sister turned her onto the $148 Emma Lewishan Skin Reset serum which helps in 'getting rid of any pigmentation'.

Georgia also credits the importance of massaging face oils in to your skin to help reduce puffiness. 

'It really does helps bring all the blood to the face and gets rid of any excess fluid that's sitting around or puffy eyes and it's a really good practice,' she added. 

And, of course, sunscreen is a must with the model using two different types, including Dermalogica tinted sunscreen and the Rationale Beautiful Skin Superfluid.
