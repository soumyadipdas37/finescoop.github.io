An Australian woman has wowed thousands on social media after revealing how she made a room in her home look bigger by using mirrors from IKEA.

Jo from Canberra purchased several square mirrors which were tessellated and stuck to one of the walls in the room.

'Our before and after IKEA mirror hack - spent $120 on mirrors, my Dad did it cause it's a bit tricky to cut and paste,' she said online and shared photos on Facebook.

The clever idea makes the room appear larger as the mirrors reflect the objects back into the room.

With help from her Dad, some of the mirrors were cut in half to ensure they lined up neatly against the bottom and top of the wall.

'My Dad used the diamond cutter sold [at] Bunnings for $6,' she said.

The social media post was 'liked' more than 2,400 times and others said the new style looked 'gorgeous' and 'beautiful'.

'Oh I want your dad to come and do mine! It's fabulous!' one woman said.

'What a difference a mirror makes. Looks so much bigger and open,' another said.

Many more said the style is reminiscent of a similar look that was popular in the 80s.

'We did this back in 1982,' one man said, and another added: 'Back to the 1980s! Love it.'

IKEA sell a range of different wall mirrors, though the cheapest is the LOTS 30-centimetre four pack of square mirrors priced at $15

Those who are considering replicating Jo's hack themselves may also wish to consider larger square mirrors, such as the LARBRO 60-centimetre mirror priced at $14.99.

The mirrors can be purchased online or from IKEA stores nationally.
