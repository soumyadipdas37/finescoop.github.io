Chrissy went on to confirm the pregnancy herself in selfie videos showing off her already visible bump. 

She later revealed that the baby, who comes after she and John welcomed Luna and Miles through IVF, was conceived naturally and a surprise for the couple.

'It was a surprise. A little quarantine surprise, I guess you could say,' John shared with Craig Melvin while on the Today show. 'But we're very excited, and we’re grateful for all the well-wishes we've gotten from people all around the world. Thank you so much.' 

Chrissy and John married in 2013, after six years of dating, and welcomed Luna in 2016 followed by Miles in 2018, both through IVF. 

Last year, Chrissy said she wanted to wait a little longer before expanding their family.  

After a fan asked her on Instagram last year when she was going to have another child, Chrissy replied, 'Gonna try to wait a few years before trying again. These guys are exhausting!'
