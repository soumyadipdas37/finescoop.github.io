Middlesbrough are prepared to sell goalkeeper Aynsley Pears with one year remaining on his contract, Sportsmail understands.

It had been expected that the club would secure the future of the highly-rated stopper, who is the son of former Boro favourite Stephen.

Pears, 22, has appeared 25 times for the Championship club and was first choice for the majority of last season under Jonathan Woodgate.

However, Neil Warnock started with Dejan Stojanovic during Friday's 4-3 win over Shrewsbury in the EFL Cup and sources say the club are open to offers for Pears.

That will come as a surprise to many supporters and Pears - a former England youth international - is likely to attract much interest.

His contract expires next summer but, despite talks, it now appears that his days on Teesside are numbered.
