The Love Island star, who announced he had become a father in January after a brief relationship with long-time friend Casey Ranger, admitted earlier this month that he is missing his baby daughter.

It's unclear why Jack isn't seeing Blossom and fans soon flooded the comments asking the reality star, with some suspecting the pair were taking precautions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

One wrote: 'Ah why haven't you seen her?', while another follower queried: 'Oh no are you not seeing her :( so sad xxx.'  

A third chimed: 'Ah can you not see her? She's your double.'

One fan said: 'Just seen online he was in a packed bar yesterday so I think the mum is protecting the baby obviously because of Covid.' 

MailOnline has contacted Jack's representatives for comment.
