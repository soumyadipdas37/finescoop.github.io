A $48 mascara that promises to give users instant volume, length and 'stretch' is winning praise from beauty lovers around the world, and it's so popular it's selling four units each minute.

British makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury's new Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes mascara was only released last week, but it has already received huge acclaim from beauty bloggers and experts - who say it is a 'miracle' product and the 'best mascara in the world'.

The $48 product works so well because it loads more black at the roots of the lashes, which creates an illusion of thickness at the base.

The paddle brush has been specially designed with 'load, comb and lift technology', which lifts your eyelashes and 'vertically paints' each one, no matter how small it is.

Thousands who have managed to get their hands on the sellout product have shared before-and-after photos that illustrate just how transformative it is for your lashes.

'My eyelashes are straight and could never stay up... until NOW!' one reviewer posted.

'I cannot begin to tell you how exciting this product is,' another fan added.

One beauty editor said that after trying 200 mascaras during her time, she thinks this is the best she has ever laid her hands on: 

'This new mascara deserves bragging rights. In fact, I'd stick my neck out and say this is the best mascara I've ever tried,' she said.  

* INNOVATIVE BRUSH: The injection moulded, micro pro precision paddle brush with 'load, comb and lift technology' lifts the lashes 'like air' and vertically paints each individual eyelash. 

The mascara only launched a week ago, but it has been so successful it's been selling four wands (pictured) per minute

* DIAMOND-SHAPED BRISTLES: The diamond-shaped bristles on each side of the brush follow the lash architecture, reading the fan of the lashes for a magnifying and amplifying effect. 

* PUSH-UP LASH LIFTING POLYMER: Derived from the Larch Tree, this natural gummy stretch and flex film helps to create a push-yup hold.

* NATURAL WAXES: Carnauba wax also known as the 'Queen of Waxes' and Microcrystalline wax add body and texture to the formula for weightless volume.

* KERATIN: Keratin ceates a super-strong conditioning effect on individual hair fibres to create a thicker look and feel on the lashes.

A staggering 96 per cent of women who have tried the mascara agreed that their lashes are magnified and amplified as a result of using it.

Meanwhile, 93 per cent said it gives their eyelashes a 'voluminous definition'.

The mascara had a 45,000-person waiting list before it launched last week, and since it launched Charlotte Tilbury has been selling four wands per minute.

One of the reasons why the mascara is so innovative is because it is made with keratin, which creates a conditioning effect on individual hair fibres to give the illusion of a thicker look and feel on the lashes.

It also boasts carnauba wax, which is also known as the 'queen of waxes' and micorcrystalline wax, which gives weightless volume and a false eyelash-style finish.  

The mascara is available in one shade, 'Super Black', and in one size, a 10mL bottle.
