Police have arrested another 72 Extinction Rebellion activists as they swooped on demonstrators lying in the road to block Boris Johnson's route to Parliament today.

It brings the total number of eco-warriors detained to 232 since they kick-started their fortnight of chaos in the capital on Friday following a coronavirus recess.  

The arrests were made for a range of offences including breaching Public Order conditions, obstructing the highway, obstructing police and assault on an emergency worker. 

Several activists had to be cleared from the road where they had been lying down in an attempt to block Mr Johnson's route to Prime Minister's Questions this morning.

Activists began their two-week campaign on Friday and intend to keep going for two weeks, with more protests planned across the country

Activists carried banners, banged drums and chanted as many spilled outside the stipulated protest area and blockaded Great George Street today. 

Crowds cheered in solidarity with those arrested by police for refusing to heed warnings that they would be detained if they did not move.

Others appeared to let their bodies go limp or simply looked away as police warned them to move within the protest area outside Parliament.

In a separate stunt outside the Home Office nearby, two XR protesters hastily unloaded a large piece of tree trunk from a flatbed lorry and glued their hands together through a hollowed-out section in the middle.

They were joined by scores of protesters moments later, some pouring a red liquid to symbolise blood, and blocking the entire road.

XR spokesperson Tamsin Omand, 35, from London, said that protesters wanted the Prime Minister to see and hear their action.

Mx Omand said: 'The climate and ecological emergency has to be the absolute priority - how we are going to transform society into one that is fit for the crises we are already experiencing and the ones coming down the road.

'We are seeing a Parliament that has failed on every count - Boris Johnson wasn't even around for the first Cobras (of the coronavirus pandemic), so if that is the attitude he is going to take to the climate and ecological emergency we are in dire straits.

'Disruption is a core tenet of how XR works and how we have managed to achieve so much in a short period of time.

'We have been outside Downing Street blocking his route on both sides and of course he's encountering us here in the square - I think we are impossible to ignore.'

They added: 'Our message to Boris Johnson is that he's really the last Prime Minister who can do something, that can take the action required to set us on a new course. He's got a new son - he needs to think what the world will look like in 20 years.'

Yesterday, dozens of activists were arrested for a series of offences, including blocking a public highway and assaulting a member of the emergency services 

Members of the environmental campaign group regularly block roads to cause maximum disruption and draw attention to their cause

The Metropolitan Police said protests could only take place off the main roads at Parliament Square between 8am and 7pm

Fellow XR supporter Andrew Stevenson, a 44-year-old consultant surgeon from Somerset, said he felt compelled to join the protest.

He said: 'I've been a doctor for 20 years, I qualified from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital that sits directly opposite Parliament, and if you told me 20 years ago that I would be doing what I'm doing now - non-violent direct action to try and get the Government to act in a reasonable way to the threat of the climate and ecological emergency - I would have told you 'That's crazy, of course they have that in hand.' They don't.

'Every day doctors and healthcare professionals use science - if we don't do that it's negligence.

'We have a duty to keep our knowledge up to date, treat our patients as best we can. What we have now is a situation whereby the science has been crystal clear for decades - yet we've had decades of inaction.'

The Metropolitan Police said 160 arrests were made, as of 11pm yesterday , for offences including breaching public order conditions, obstructing the highway, obstructing police and assault on an emergency worker.

Further protests are planned around the country during the rest of this week and into next.

Last year, more than 1,700 arrests were made during Extinction Rebellion's 10-day 'Autumn Uprising', which saw major disruption across the UK. 

Various stunts are due to take place throughout the day, including a 'theatrical' display highlighting 'how the climate crisis is causing death', and a silent protest outside Buckingham Palace, Extinction Rebellion said

Further events are planned to take place up until September 10 across the city, including a 'carnival of corruption' outside the Treasury, and the 'walk of shame' near the Bank of England
