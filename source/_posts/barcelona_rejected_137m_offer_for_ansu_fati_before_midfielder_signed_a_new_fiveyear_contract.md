Barcelona reportedly rejected a huge £137million offer for Ansu Fati before the midfielder signed a new five-year contract with a £367m release clause.

The LaLiga side tied down the 17-year-old to a new deal earlier this week after he enjoyed a breakthrough campaign at the Nou Camp last season but the Spaniard was thought to be on Manchester United's radar in July.

According to Marca, the Spaniard's agent Jorge Mendes informed the Catalans of a club who were prepared to make an offer of £114m with £23m in add-ons but the Catalans were not prepared to sell.

The club also officially unveiled the youngster as a member of their senior squad ahead of his 18th birthday on October 31 and he has taken up the No22 after the departure of Arturo Vidal.

Fati's previous release clause was £155m after he signed his first professional contract in December. 

He broke 95-year national record earlier this month to become Spain's youngest ever goalscorer and has pledged his future to Barca until 2024. 

The midfielder was said to be one of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's targets with Spanish publication Sport reporting that United had made a fresh enquiry back in August.

Jadon Sancho has been the club's No1 target in this window but they have been unable to negotiate a fee with Borussia Dortmund - who are determined to hold out for £108m.

Fati scored eight goals and made one assists in 33 appearances across all competitions last season and is seen as a key part of Barca's future plans.

The winger became the second-youngest player in the club's history to be handed his full debut during a 5-2 win against Real Betis in August last year aged 16 years and 298 days.
