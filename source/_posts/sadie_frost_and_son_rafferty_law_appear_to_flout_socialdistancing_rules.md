MailOnline have contacted representatives for comment. 

The stringent 'rule of six' ban came into force across England on Monday, in an attempt to tackle rising coronavirus infection rates by restricting meetings both indoors and outdoors, including homes, parks, pubs and restaurants. 

Police will fine people up to £3,200 if they disobey the rules.

The events industry is currently 'starring into the abyss' due to the lack of clarity about the Government ban on gatherings of more than six people, according to the Telegraph.

The publication reported that events organisers are experiencing mass cancellations within the industry, which supports 700,000 employees.

Jane Longhurst, chief executive of the Meetings Industry Association, said: 'It hasn’t actually defined what government is trying to do, and there’s no clarity, and it has completely shattered any confidence that anyone holding events had.' 

If arts events were deemed against the law, the police have the powers to enforce these legal limits, including to issue fines of £100, doubling for further breaches up to a maximum of £3,200.

Sadie and Rafferty's film Contact was shot during lockdown in a bid to bring 'hope' to those feeling alone during the trying period of time.

Sadie told Love magazine: ''We were so conscious of this being such a tough time for all the young people whose studies, early careers and passions were stopped in their flow. 

'I wanted to make something that told their stories.'
