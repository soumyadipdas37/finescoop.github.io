A father who left his son brain damaged after shaking him when he wouldn't stop crying failed to tell doctors what happened for two weeks.

The father-of-three, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, shook his six-month-old son twice on March 15 last year, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

On Tuesday, Southport District Court heard the infant's mother came home from work on the day of the incident to find the child floppy, lethargic and vomiting.

Hospital staff were unable to find anything wrong with the boy, even after puncturing his lumbar to rule out meningitis.

His mother took him back to hospital multiple times over the next two weeks because the youngster was 'off'.

An MRI taken on March 30 revealed that the boy's brain had been bleeding. 

The father denied any wrongdoing during police interviews on April 8 and 9, but his partner continued to question him that night.

'He admitted to shaking the child twice after the child would not stop crying,' Crown prosecutor Michael Mitchell told the court.

'It is not suggested the offending was anything other than an act of frustration due to the child's crying.' 

Police spoke to the father again and he admitted to shaking the child for about two seconds.

He pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm and was sentenced to two years in jail with immediate release on parole.

Defence barrister John McInnes said he was sorry for his actions, but added the man had been a drunk who was known to be violent.  

Judge Catherine Muir said the offence was 'serious violent offending committed by you against a vulnerable child'.

'A child who needs your protection not for your to lose control and shake him for crying.' 

She accepted it was a one-off incident.

The couple have separated and the boy is in the care of his mother, who supervises their visits.

He allowed overnight visits with his older two children. 

The man moved to Australia at the age of 18 and could face deportation.
