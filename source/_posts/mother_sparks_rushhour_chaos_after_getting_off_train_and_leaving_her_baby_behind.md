A mother sparked rush-hour chaos after 'getting off a train and leaving her baby behind' at Peckham Rye station in south east London.

The woman was parted from her child, who a commuter said was in a pram, after getting off at around 5pm yesterday. 

The pair were reunited after the mother called Southeastern and took the next train to pick up her child at the following stop.  

Southeastern said the situation was dealt with 'happily and quickly', adding: 'The unaccompanied child was helped off the train at the next stop' (file photo)

Passengers said the train was delayed while she came to collect her baby as they took to social media to share their shock at the incident. 

One Twitter user said: 'The last reason I expected my train to be delayed at its stop was because “a mother left her baby on the train at the previous stop” and they’ve had to hold it there so she could come and collect it.'

Another added: 'My friend's train was delayed because someone forgot their baby in the pram.

'The mum had to get the next train to meet the baby. I mean how do you forget YOUR BABY.. A WHOLE BABY'.  



Social media users reacted to the incident on Twitter, above, with one passenger claiming the train was delayed while it was held so that the mother could come and collect her baby

Southeastern said the situation was dealt with 'happily and quickly'.

A spokesman for the train company said: 'We received a help point call from a mother to advise she had become separated from her child at Peckham Rye station this evening, while travelling on the 17:04 Victoria to Dartford service.

'The unaccompanied child was helped off the train at the next stop (Nunhead) by station colleagues, while the mother travelled on the next service to collect the child.

'Both were safe and well, and the service was back on the move with a five minute delay.'
