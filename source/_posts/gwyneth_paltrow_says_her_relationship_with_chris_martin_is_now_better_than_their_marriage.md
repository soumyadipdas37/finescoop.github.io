Gwyneth Paltrow joined longtime pal Drew Barrymore on her new talk show on Tuesday and dished on her family life.

On the latest episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, the pals chatted via video as Drew expressed her admiration for the lifestyle guru and her successful  'conscious uncoupling' from ex-husband Chris Martin.

Gwyneth, 47, and musician Chris, 43, share children Apple, 16, and Moses, 14, together and split in in 2014 after 10 years of marriage.

The Iron Man star confessed that she gets along better with the singer now that they have mastered a harmonious co-parenting lifestyle. 

She explained: 'I mean it’s so interesting because in a way my divorce and my relationship with Chris now is better than our marriage was. So I do think that it can be done.' 

The Goop founder talked about the importance of accountability and owning your failings in the relationship once the romantic part has broken down.

'You have to have radical accountability. You have to know that every relationship is 50/50. No matter what you think, how you think you were wronged, or how bad you perceive the other persons actions, or whatever the case may be.

'If you are brave enough to take responsibility for your half and really look at your own garbage and your own trauma and how it’s presenting in the world and in your relationship then there really is somewhere to go,' Gwyneth said

'If you are brave enough to take responsibility for your half and really look at your own garbage and your own trauma and how it’s presenting in the world and in your relationship then there really is somewhere to go and something to learn and something to heal.

'We are all part good and part bad, it’s not binary, we are all grey area. We all are trying our best. I really wanted my kids to not be traumatized, if it were possible.' 

Gwyneth said she and the Coldplay vocalist had to commit to putting their children first even on days when they didn't want to play happy families.

'You take a deep breath and you look the person in the eye and you remember your pact and you smile and you hug and you make a hug and recommit to this new relationship that you are trying to foster.

The actress admitted it's not easy but the long-term goal is to nurture a sense of unity.

'Some days it's not as good as it looks. We also have good days and bad days but I think it's driving towards the same purpose of unity and love and what's best for them. 

'We have this idea that just because we break up we can’t love the things about the person anymore that we loved and that’s not true.' 

Gwyneth is now happily remarried to TV producer Brad Falchuk, who she tied the knot with in 2018.

Chris, meanwhile, has moved on to actress Dakota Johnson, who he has been dating since 2017 with a brief split last year..
