Jill Biden's ex-husband has said he was 'betrayed by the Bidens', claiming once again that he was still married to Jill when she met Joe, and denying the well-publicized story of the Bidens' meeting on a blind date. 

Bill Stevenson, 72, told Inside Edition on Monday night that the Bidens' fairytale story of meeting on a blind date, shortly after Jill finalized her divorce and while Joe was dealing with the trauma of his first wife's death in a car crash, was a lie.

Host Steven Fabian asked Stevenson: Is the story of the blind date true? 

'No, not even a little bit,' he replied.

Stevenson told Steven Fabian (right) the story of the Biden's blind date meeting was untrue

Stevenson married Jill in 1970, and two years later he said they worked on Joe's campaign

Stevenson is about to publish an as-yet untitled book that he says will blow the lid off the sham story. 

Stevenson insisted that he and Jill were still married when Jill met Joe - and that they met three years before the Bidens claim.

'I was betrayed by the Bidens. Joe was my friend; Jill was my wife,' he said.

Stevenson met Jill in August 1979, and the pair married six months later, when Jill was 18 years old. 

Stevenson, who ran a celebrated rock venue in Wilmington, Delaware, said that he introduced Jill and Joe in 1972.

At the time, Joe was a council member campaigning for the U.S. Senate, and was married to his first wife, Neilia. 

'I threw a fundraiser for him in August, raised between $2,500 and $3,000,' said Stevenson.

'I introduced Joe to Jill in 1972. Right before the election, in '72, 

'Jill, Joe, Neilia and I were in his kitchen. How do you forget that?'

Neilia Biden would die four months later, in a car crash in December 1972.  

Stevenson said he first suspected Biden and Jill were having an affair in August 1974. He was then 26, Jill was 23 and Joe was 31.

At the time Biden was married to his first wife Neilia who died along with their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a car crash between the election and Biden taking his Senate seat.

Stevenson said he first suspected Biden and Jill were having an affair in August 1974. He was then 26, Jill was 23 and Joe was 31. 'Then one of her best friends told me she thought Joe and Jill were getting a little too close. I was surprised that she came to me.' Pictured: Jill and Joe in 1987 

Bruce Springsteen was due to play at Stevenson's venue, The Stone Balloon, and Stevenson had to go to northern New Jersey to pay him in advance.

'He told the show he asked Jill to go with him and she said no — something he vividly remembers.

'She said Joe asked me to keep an eye on the boys,' he said. 'I thought, hmm...'

In October, he said he was certain Jill was having an affair. 

Their car, a brown Corvette, was involved in a crash in May, he discovered, and, surprised, he asked the man who informed him about the crash for details.

'He looks at me and says oh, she wasn't driving. 

'I said, her beloved Corvette, she wasn't driving? He said, no, Senator Biden was driving.'

Stevenson said he then confronted Jill, and asked her if she was having an affair with Biden. 

'She didn't say anything - she just looked at me,' he recalled. 

'I said you have to go. You have to get your own place.'

The way the Bidens tell their story, Joe saw a picture of Jill in March 1975 — after her marriage crashed — and they went on a date and have been together since

Stevenson and Jill divorced in May 1975.

Jill and Joe say that they did not meet until March 1975, when the divorce was nearly finalized. 

'It's years ago, but guess what - it's so current right now. Because he is picking on people about character,' said Stevenson. 

'I've said from the very beginning that I have no hard feelings, about Joe, Jill, the affair. But if I don't do it now, it's never going to be able to be brought up.' 

Stevenson said he voted for Barack Obama, but will vote for Donald Trump in November, because he agrees with his stance on backing the police.

Jill Biden's spokesman dismissed Stevenson's claims, which were reported by DailyMail.com in August.

'These claims are fictitious, seemingly to sell and promote a book. The relationship of Joe and Jill Biden is well documented.' 

But her ex-husband Bill Stevenson told DailyMail.com that their story about how the presidential candidate fell in love with Jill after a blind date is made up
