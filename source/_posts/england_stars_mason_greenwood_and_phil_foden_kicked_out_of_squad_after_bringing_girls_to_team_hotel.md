England youngsters Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood will not travel with their team-mates to Denmark today after footage emerged of the pair bringing girls back to the team hotel in Iceland.  

The pair made their senior international debuts in the win over Iceland on Saturday - but those accomplishments have now been overshadowed.

Players have been given strict guidelines to ensure Covid safety - and the images - published by Icelandic outlet DV - appears to show Foden and Greenwood disregard those protocols on Sunday.

Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood have broken Iceland's Covid-19 restrictions after inviting girls back to their quarantine hotel in Iceland.

After a spike in local transmissions, the government recently clamped down and brought in further restrictions.

Although the England team are exempt, foreign travellers arriving in the country are being forced to quarantine for 14 days before they are allowed to travel freely in the country.

The pair's conduct in bringing girls back has also contravened the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty.

In the short clip, Foden and Greenwood appear to be wearing their new England training wear and the players are now in hot water with management.

In an interview with DV, one of the girls in the Snapchat video allegedly filmed in the hotel room said: 'We had no idea about these [Covid-19] rules, they never said we could not take pictures.'

Another girl claimed to have notified the England stars that the pictures were in circulation with a Snapchat message, but 'they have not opened it'.

She also claimed to have been in a relationship 'with one of the boys for a few days', noting: 'The only thing I can say is that I had been talking to one of them for a few days. I'm not going to say where.'

Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May. 

Manchester City midfielder Foden started for Gareth Southgate's side against Iceland on Saturday night, making his senior international debut, while Greenwood came off the bench to achieve the same accolade.

Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood's mistake is just the latest in a long line of embarrassing episodes that have affected Gareth Southgate's England squad.

All three of the squad's most recent games have been affected by the behaviour of different members of the squad, beginning with a bust-up between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez back in November.

The clash, revealed exclusively by Sportsmail, came in the build-up to two Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo, and was in the wake of the pair's clubs - Manchester City and Liverpool - meeting on the pitch.

Sterling attempted to grab Gomez by the neck following his arrival in the players' canteen, the day after tempers had flared between them on the pitch.

Covid-19 then ended international football until this week, and the build-up to England's first match against Iceland was hampered by Harry Maguire's arrest while on holiday in Mykonos.  

The Manchester United captain was left at home after being arrested in Greece, but has appealed his convictions and will face a full retrial after appealing the decision last week.   

In a statement printed in Greek publication Protothema, one of the arresting officers on the night of the scrap recalled Mr Maguire, 27, launching a torrent of abuse as he was placed under arrest while reportedly trying to protect his sister.

The statement alleges Mr Maguire shouted: 'F*** you all, f*** off, f*** the Greek police, f*** policemen, f*** Greece, f*** the Greek civilisation, I don't give a s***'.

The statement adds that Maguire, 'attacked the sergeant... he pushed him away and kicked him in the right leg causing swelling of his left and right tibia.'

Now, in the build-up to England's Nations League game against Denmark on Tuesday, Greenwood and Foden have again cast a shadow over the squad. 

While the pair would have been looking ahead to England's next fixture against Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, they will now leave Iceland under a dark cloud. 

The pair were both absent from England training on Monday and it was then confirmed that they would leave the camp and travel home before the team's second and final match.

England boss Southgate is set to face the media for a press conference on Monday afternoon, where he is likely to field questions about Foden and Greenwood's behaviour. 

Sportsmail has contacted the players' agents for comment.
