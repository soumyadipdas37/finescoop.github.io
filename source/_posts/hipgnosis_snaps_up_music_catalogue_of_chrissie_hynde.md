Hipgnosis has snapped up the music catalogue of Chrissie Hynde, one of the founding members of The Pretenders. 

The song fund's latest deal will see it add all 164 of Hynde's published songs, including Brass In Pocket, I'll Stand By You and Don't Get Me Wrong, to its 13,000-strong library of hits. 

Hipgnosis, founded by Beyonce's former manager Merck Mercuriadis, buys songs and their copyrights.

Investors who own Hipgnosis shares bag a return generated through royalties the music generates. 

Mercuriadis said: 'This is very personal for me. Chrissie is one of my favourite songwriters of all time and The Pretenders are one of my favourite bands of all time. 

'She has been a powerful role model for women and men all over the globe for 40 years.' 

The Pretenders formed in 1978 and are still touring. Their current shows have been postponed to next year due to the pandemic. 

They have released 11 albums, including Hate For Sale, which came out this summer
