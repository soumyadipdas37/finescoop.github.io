Kyly Clarke has offered words of advice to those wanting to not only look their best, but feel great on the inside, too.

The 39-year-old flaunted her toned figure on Instagram on Monday, uploading a picture of herself to remind others 'caring for your body' was fundamental.

The mother-of-one was captured holding a medicine ball while in the middle of performing a Russian twist.

Yummy mummy: On Monday, Kyly Clarke showed off her trim, taut and terrific figure and reminded others about the importance of 'caring for your body' 

The ab exercise is used to work and strengthen the abdominal muscles by performing a twisting motion.

Kyly looked a million dollars in leopard print tights and a simple black sports bra. 

'Remember looking your best and feeling your best may appear different on a daily basis,' she captioned the Instagram post.

'I truly believe caring for your body through a healthy driven lifestyle is fundamental for personal growth and allows you the opportunity to feel that you can conquer anything.'

It is not the first time the former WAG has flaunted her incredible physique online.

Following her split with ex-husband Michael Clarke after seven years together, the brunette beauty has become an advocate for healthy living and promoting the 'never take yourself too seriously' motto.

She shared another photo of herself showing off her biceps at the gym earlier this month.

The post was aimed at grabbing the attention of her fans to remind them humour and 'being able to joke daily with family and friends is what truly makes you smile from the inside'.

'We all have our burdens to bare, we all suffer from some kind of stress that life bestows on us, but we truly are in this together,' Kyly captioned the post.

'So be kind, gentle and soft with the next person you brush past, make them smile or laugh and see the affect it has on you. 

Show stopper: 'We all have our burdens to bare, we all suffer from some kind of stress that life bestows on us, but we truly are in this together,' Kyly said earlier this month

'You never know what battle they are currently facing. And trust me, there is generally always something on someone’s mind. Spread love and kindness.'  

Kyly's positive attitude followed Michael reflecting on his life a year after separating from his wife.   

The retired Australian cricketer told The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine he was 'so happy right now' and 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said. 

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for.' 

Michael and Kyly separated from each other last September, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.
