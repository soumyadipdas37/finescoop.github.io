Pia Miller's multi-millionaire agent boyfriend Patrick Whitesell spent quality time with her youngest son, Lennox on Tuesday.

The former Home and Away actress' son, 13, and her beau, 55, enjoyed a lively game of basketball in Sydney.

Patrick worked up a sweat on the court as he practiced shooting hoops with Lennox, one week after he reunited with Pia, 36, in Sydney after months of living apart.
