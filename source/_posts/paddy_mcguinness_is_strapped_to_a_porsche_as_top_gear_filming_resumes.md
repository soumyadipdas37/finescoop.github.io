Paddy McGuinness has returned to filming the new series of Top Gear.

The TV presenter, 47, took to Instagram on Sunday to share a behind-the-scenes look at the forthcoming season, as he was strapped to the top of a Porsche.

Holding a teddy bear in his hands, seemingly for comfort, Paddy looked bemused as he sat on top of the supercar while wearing a helmet.

Paddy braced himself for the strong winds that would hit him during the segment by wearing a long-sleeved black top and trousers tucked into heavy duty boots.

A camera was strapped to the roof of the car so that the crew could capture all of Paddy's reactions once the race was underway.

Joking about the situation, Paddy wrote in the caption: 'Top Gear Producers - Can we strap you to the top of a Porsche, that’s going to be driven very fast by a former F1 Champion? Me - Can I have a teddy?'

The upcoming series only resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted production of the hit BBC car show.  

On Saturday, Top Gear released a first look trailer with hosts Paddy, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris ahead of the new series.

In the 60-second adrenaline-pumping video, it features Paddy's dramatic car crash where he lost control of a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo in June.

As well as Paddy's car crash, the trailer shows the comedian risking his life once again in a daring wall of death challenge.

Arriving at the dare-devil stunt, Paddy quips: 'They've gone, "How can we get the ratings? We'll kill them all!"' 

It then shows the Take Me Out star zooming around a motordrome in an old insurance write-off, a Porsche Cayman, as he warns: 'This does not feel good!'

While Freddie, 42, and Chris, 45, look on in horror as they shout: 'No, no, no!'

Yet this isn't the only dangerous stunt for Paddy and he is also shown zooming across head-first on a zip-wire in north Wales. 

The start date for the new series still remains unknown but it is expected to return later this year.
