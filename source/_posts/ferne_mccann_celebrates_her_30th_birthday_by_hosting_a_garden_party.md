Ferne McCann has celebrated her 30th birthday in style by hosting a garden party complete with an incredible dance podium and five of her closest friends. 

The former TOWIE star marked her milestone birthday at her farmhouse mansion in Essex on Saturday with live music and five guests to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines. 

Ferne wowed in a halterneck orange dress as she danced with her hands in the air on the podium in her garden with friends including sisters Sam and Billie Faiers.

The First Time Mum star showcased her gym-honed figure in the tight-fitting dress which she paired with a white belt to cinch in her waist. 

Styling her short blonde locks in loose waves, Ferne opted for minimal makeup with a dash of bronzer on her cheekbones to keep all eyes on her outfit. 

Meanwhile mother-of-two Sam, 29, looked radiant with her caramel tresses tied up with a sweet white scrunchie as she posed with Ferne for her Instagram story.

The Mummy Diaries star opted for a mini leopard print dress as she giggled and pouted in a series of snaps with best friend Ferne. 

It comes after new coronavirus restrictions placed a ban on more than six people gathering socially indoors or outdoors. 

But the group still appeared to enjoy the festivities as they partied together in the garden surrounded by rolling fields.

In August Ferne, who is mum to daughter Sunday, two, turned 30 and jetted to the South of France for just one day after she had to cancel her birthday party due to Covid-19 restrictions. 

Posting to Instagram, Ferne looked sensational in a lime green silk dress featuring a cowl neck and asymmetric hemline. 

Captioning the video, Ferne revealed that she had just arrived back in London following a short stay in the South of France, adding that she scrapped plans for a birthday bash.

'Woweeee just touched down in London Town after a quick pit stop in SOF. I had to cancel my 30th birthday party this wkend due to covid, but I can safely say I have THE best friends who have spoilt me rotten! So god dam.' [sic]

Earlier this month the TV star also purchased a £100,000 Range Rover Vogue which she described as a 'milestone' moment for her.

'Having a work ethic has always been so important to me. Even more so since having Sunday. I'm so grateful for every work opportunity that's come my way and I have seized each one of them. 

'Buying this car is a milestone that shows how far I've come and I'm immensely grateful . (Thankyou & SO MUCH love to kai88_ for sorting me my new whip skurrt skurrt....the sexiest car Thankyou Thankyou.)
