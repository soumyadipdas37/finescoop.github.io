He recently completed two weeks of mandatory government quarantine at a Darwin detention centre, just so he could see his girlfriend Sam Royce for one month.

And Jarrod Woodgate was certainly feeling free on Thursday.

The Bachelor In Paradise star went completely nude for a swim at the Motor Car Falls, in Kakadu.

The fair-haired star posted a bare-bottomed photo on his Instagram account, captioning the eyebrow-raising photo: 'Suns out, buns out ☀️', alongside the hashtag 'sorrymum'.

Last month Jarrod Woodgate revealed the reality of two weeks of mandated government quarantine at a Darwin detention centre. 

The 33-year-old reality star was self-isolating at the camp after catching a flight to the Northern Territory capital from Victoria, just so he could spend four weeks with his girlfriend, Sam. 

And despite the no doubt challenging conditions, the vineyard manager was upbeat about his experience at the camp, located at Howard Springs.

'When I got here I was starting to get really nervous as I thought it would be an army base room,' he said in an Instagram video on Thursday. 

'[But] It is quite cool. You have your own little desk, you have your en suite, I have a king single bed so I just fit and I have my own balcony.'

Not a whinger! Despite the no doubt challenging conditions, the vineyard manager was upbeat about his experience at the camp, located at Howard Springs 

He continued: 'You're allowed to exercise twice a day for 20 minutes, they bring you meals three times a day supplied by the Hilton.' 

Jarrod then panned around his room, so he could show off the treats his girlfriend Sam had bought to keep him occupied during his stay.

The blonde beauty had purchased magazines, puzzles, texters and Play-Doh for her beau. 

Not bad: Jarrod was pleased with the accommodation, which included a king single bed along with an en suite 

'I have 13 and a half days left. So far I have been up for two hours and achieved a run, which I haven't done [for a while] ...Some sit-ups and some squats.' 

Jarrod said he was going to spend the rest of the day doing a puzzle.  

Sam also gifted him a number of snacks, including Shapes, corn chips and gum. 

Healthy: Later, Jarrod revealed his modest breakfast, which included Weet-Bix and fruit

The reality star is the vineyard manager at Tom's Cap in rural Victoria, the state worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic.  

His trip to Darwin comes after the couple celebrated their six month anniversary together. 

Keeping a safe distance: Jarrod showed the outside of his cabin

'If someone had told me a year ago that I would be the happiest man in the universe on this day I wouldn't have believed them,' he wrote in a gushing post last month.

 'You are the most amazing, kind, loving, passionate and beautiful person I have ever met. You are my everything.'

Jarrod was previously in a relationship with Bachelor In Paradise star, Keira Maguire. The pair split in 2018 and she is now seeing Love Island star, Matt Zukowski.
