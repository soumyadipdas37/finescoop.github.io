Sunrise host Samantha Armytage has been left shocked after the Queensland Premier refused to help a woman trying to see her gravely ill father before he dies.  

Helen Dudok travelled to Brisbane from a COVID-19 hotspot in the Macedon Ranges in regional Victoria to visit her dying dad. 

On Monday she told Sunrise that Queensland Health denied her request to quarantine at her parents' isolated home south of Brisbane. 

Ms Dudok was left heartbroken as her 87-year-old father may pass away before her 14-day quarantine period is over - and called on Annastacia Palaszczuk to intervene.  

She claimed Queensland Health told her 'they would hold the body in the morgue' if her father died while she was in mandatory isolation. 

The Sunrise host said they reached out to the Premier and Chief Health Officer, Dr Jeanette Young, for help but they both refused to appear on Monday's show.

Ms Dudok was overcome with emotion as she tried to explain what was happening. 

'They said that should my dad pass away, that's ok, because they will hold his body in a morgue and I can arrange the funeral once I come out,' she told viewers. 

Ms Armytage was left visibly shocked and described the situation as 'unbelievable'.

'That is one of the most heartless things I have ever heard,' she told viewers. 

'Helen, I am so sorry for you and I hope that some sense comes fast to Queensland Health and that you are allowed out to see your parents.'   

Ms Dudok said that both her parents require 24 hour a care and she also wanted to help her sister look after them as her father's condition worsens.  

'I only asked to go there to help so between the two and us we can look after mum and dad.

'I've offered to have a COVID test, I've offered to have an ankle bracelet to prove that I won't be leaving my parent's place.'  

The shocked daughter does not understand why she can't stay at the isolated home in Browns Plains. 

'There's no one at my parent's house except for my parents and my sister who is looking after them day and night, 24/7, completely alone,' she said.

The chief health officer is under fire for writing to the state's Border Force boss asking permission for Hollywood star Tom Hanks to enter Queensland while families like the Dudok's are banned from visiting sick and dying relatives.   

The actor landed from the US on Tuesday night after he was granted an exemption and given permission to quarantine in a resort of his choosing. 

Ms Palaszczuk also sparked outrage when she allowed 400 people from the AFL community to skip mandatory quarantine and go straight to the Mecure Resort in Carrara on the Gold Coast in July. 

Despite the allowances for AFL stars and actors, Sarah Caisip who lives in coronavirus-free Canberra missed the chance to her dying father and missed his funeral in Brisbane on Thursday.

She was forced to see her father's body by herself, dressed in full personal protective equipment because of the state's draconian border closures.
