Puma have confirmed the signing of Neymar, who parted ways with Nike just two weeks ago.  

The 28-year-old striker decided to end his £78.6million partnership with Nike after 15 years and will now wear Puma's legendary 'Puma King football boots'.

The news has been announced on social media in a message that is entitled 'The KING is Back'.

Nike have sponsored the Brazilian since he was 13 years old, long before he became a professional. During his rise to stardom at Santos, they even supplied sports equipment for the club.

Neymar's switch of allegiances could be bad news for the American company who had reportedly signed the striker until 2022.    

With the deal ending early, Nike will lose one of their biggest star and his global appeal.
