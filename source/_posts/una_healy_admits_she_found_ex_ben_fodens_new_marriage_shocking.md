Una Healy has admitted she found her ex-husband Ben Foden's new marriage to Jackie Belanoff Smith a 'big shock' as they tied the knot last August after just two weeks of dating.

In a new interview, the former Saturdays singer, 38, who split from the rugby star, 35, in 2018, credited their daughter Aoife, eight, and son Tadhg, five, for 'pulling her through' their 'devastating' divorce.

The Irish musician revealed she also sought help from a life coach to 'let go of the worry and the fear that something bad again' after hitting 'rock bottom'. 

'Life just moves faster for some than others!' Una Healy has admitted she found her ex-husband Ben Foden's marriage to Jackie Belanoff Smith (pictured last August) a 'big shock'

Una wed sportsman Ben in June 2012 after four years of dating, but their six-year marriage ended after he cheated on her with publicist Becky Milne.

On dealing with their break-up, the media personality said: 'Divorce is a tough old thing to go through. You don’t walk down the aisle expecting this to happen. And when it doesn’t work out, it’s devastating. Totally devastating.'

The What About Us hitmaker confessed she had to 'stay strong' for the sake of their children, and gushed about them comforting her with 'I love you' notes and hugs whenever she feels down.

The mother-of-two added to The Sun: 'I knew I had to pull myself out of it. I was so irritated by being surrounded by these happy families. It’s a trauma. And going and speaking to someone about a traumatic experience is nothing to be ashamed of.'

She admitted she was left stunned when her former partner announced his new relationship with New York-based businesswoman Jackie, who welcomed their first child together, Farrah, in May. 

Una told the publication: 'Last summer when he got married again, that was a big shock to me. I was like: ''Woah, what is this?''' It was something else I had to get my head around. But life goes on... it just moves faster for some than others, obviously!'

The songstress insisted while their relationship 'wasn't meant to be forever', she has no regrets as they co-parent their two children - an experience she has described as 'difficult' as Ben lives in America with his new family.

The Wild Grasses singer is now single after splitting from her boyfriend of 15 months, professional hurler David Breen, 34, in March.

Auburn-haired beauty Una admitted their on-off romance 'happened too soon after her marriage' and is 'looking forward' to dating again. 

She has moved back home to County Tipperary in Ireland with her brood after feeling 'lonely' during the UK coronavirus lockdown.

'I was quite lonely over there [in England] with my two kids. Just not having adult company. It was just the three of us', Una explained on a recent episode of new podcast Sippin' The Tea.

'I'm delighted to be back here in my home. I couldn't think of anywhere better to be right now.'
