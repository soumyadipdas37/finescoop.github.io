A photograph taken of a young couple celebrating their engagement captured their joy just five minute before the groom-to-be unexpectedly died.

Joao Guilherme Torres Fadini, 24, and his fiancée Larissa Campos, 25, joined friends to celebrate their engagement at the Itupararanga Dam, located on the Sorocaba River in the Sorocaba region of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo.

The Brazilian businessman who was described as a good swimmer kissed Larissa's forehead just moments before he tragically drowned on 31st August.

Larissa told G1 news: 'After the kiss, he took off his shirt and went into the water together with our friends.

'He asked me to wait for him and said he loved me.

'They started a swimming race to the next shore. Almost everyone gave up and there was only him and my brother-in-law Gabriel left.'

However, as the pair continued racing Joao suddenly disappeared under the water.

The group frantically searched for him and called the emergency services.

The Sao Roque Fire Department arrived at the scene following the late afternoon callout and started searching with boats and divers.
