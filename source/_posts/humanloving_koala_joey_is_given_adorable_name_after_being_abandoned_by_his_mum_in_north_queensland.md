A baby koala taken into care after being abandoned by his own mother has been given an adorable name. 

The 11-month old joey is being raised at the Rainforestation Wildlife sanctuary at Kuranda in Far North Queensland.

He was given the nickname 'Teddy' because of how affectionate he is with humans.

Wildlife carer Sharni, who is raising him, stayed awake during the night to give the tiny marsupial formula and cuddles. 

The sanctuary shared a post on Facebook and revealed the tiny koala had quickly recovered from its difficult upbringing.

'This 11-month-old koala joey had a little bit of a rough start when his Mum didn't adjust well to "mum life",' Rainforestation wrote.

'He has grown into a cheeky, confident little koala who loves interacting with his human buddies.

'We think Teddy is the perfect name since he loves his cuddles!'
