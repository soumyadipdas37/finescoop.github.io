We're just three weeks away from the return of the Champions League and fans of Liverpool, Man City, Manchester United and Chelsea are about to find out which teams they will be facing when football's elite club competition kicks off across the continent.

It wasn't that long ago that Bayern Munich beat Paris Saint-Germain to lift the trophy in Lisbon after the season stretched deep into summer following the Covid-19 shutdown. Those two will join Liverpool, and the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus in pot 1 for Thursday's draw in Nyon. 

Sportsmail has provided all you need to know ahead of the draw, including how to follow it, which teams can still book a place in the money-spinning competition and all the key dates on the road to the 2021 final in Istanbul.
