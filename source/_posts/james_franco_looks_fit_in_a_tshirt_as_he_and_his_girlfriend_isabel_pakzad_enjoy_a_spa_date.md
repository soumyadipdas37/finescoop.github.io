They're regularly spotted exercising together outdoors.

But James Franco, 42, and his girlfriend Isabel Pakzad, 27, tried out a different kind of self-care on Friday as they enjoyed a spa date together.

The Spring Breakers star and his younger girlfriend both wore casual and comfortable outfits for a day of relaxation in New York City.

James highlighted his bulging biceps and fit legs in a white graphic T-shirt and a pair of black athletic shorts with white stripes running up the legs.

He carried his essentials in a black backpack and wore a low-key pair of black trainers. 

Isabel's ensemble was less sporty, and she wore a gray crop top that showed off a bit of her midriff.

The burgeoning actress paired her top with ripped jeans that were rolled up above her ankles and decorated with colorful patches over one leg.

She rounded out the look with black zip-up platform boots, and she carried a black shopping bag.

Safety first: 

Both actors wore black decorated masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, though James removed his while his feet were being cared for.

The two made sure to catch up on their books while the staff massaged their backs. 

Afterward, the lovebirds stopped by the popular cafe Dante for some lunch and refreshments outdoors.

The couple, who tend to keep to themselves, have reportedly been dating since November 2017, though they didn't make their red carpet debut together until July 2018.

Isabel, a Penn State graduate, previously was at the University of Southern California for a Master's degree in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology. 

Franco also previously taught film courses at USC.

The aspiring actress seems to have been unfazed by accusations of inappropriate or sexually exploitative behavior leveled against the actor in January 2018. 

A Los Angeles Times report quoted five women on their experiences with him.

Some described him allegedly trying to pressure women on the set of his project to show their breasts and fuming after no one volunteered, while another woman claimed that he removed protective covers from her and other actress genitals during a scene of simulated oral sex.

One woman described being allegedly pressured into performing oral sex on the actor in a car, though she later continued a consensual relationship with him.

Last year, Franco became entangled in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's ongoing legal action over their own alleged abuse.

His testimony was sought after elevator security footage showed him next to Heard a day after a fight with Depp that allegedly left her bloodied and bruised.

Depp's attorney's wanted the Pineapple Express star to give his assessment of Heard's condition following the alleged attack.
