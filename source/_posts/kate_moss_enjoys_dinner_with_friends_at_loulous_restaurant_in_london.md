She looked effortlessly stylish as always in a red blouse, which was half tucked into her paper bag style black trousers.

Kate tied her chic look together with a black belt, which cinched her svelte waist and highlighted her model frame.

The mother-of-one added touches of glitz to her look with a selection of silver bracelets, as well as a selection of statement rings.
