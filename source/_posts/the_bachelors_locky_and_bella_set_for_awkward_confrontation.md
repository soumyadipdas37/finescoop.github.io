The Bachelor's Bella Varelis was the clear frontrunner to win Locky Gilbert's heart after sparks flew when the pair met. 

But the 25-year-old could be set to lose him over her jealousy after a tense confrontation following a raunchy body-painting group date. 

In the latest teaser for the The Bachelor, Bella is seen arguing with Locky over her love rival Irena with the Perth adventurer looking less-than-impressed. 

Is this the moment she loses him? In a new trailer, Locky Gilbert has an awkward confrontation with Bella Varelis (both pictured) after her behaviour towards rival Irena Srbinovska 

'I'm actually pretty upset. I have seen a side of Bella that I didn't think I would see,' Locky said, clearly frustrated by her. 

The mess appears to occur after Irena and Bella both 'leave their mark' on Locky's chest as part of a body-painting challenge. 

'I have decided I am going to say something to Locky because it seems like she is getting into his head,' Bella says, resolutely. 

The teaser then cuts to Bella, who appears insecure as she and Locky talk about Irena while cuddled on the couch.

Jealous? 'I have decided I am going to say something to Locky because it seems like [Irena] is getting into his head,' Bella says, resolutely. Pictured: Irena

'She hasn't said anything bad about you ever,' Locky tells her, flabbergasted. 

Later, Bella is seen speaking about it again during a tense moment at the rose ceremony. 

'I don't want her to get in between us. I'm petrified that I am going to lose him,' she is overheard saying.  

Annoyed: 'She hasn't said anything bad about you ever,' Locky says, flabbergasted.

Insecure: 'I don't want her to get in between us. I'm petrified that I am going to lose him,' Bella is heard saying following her tense confrontation with Locky



'It's okay. We'll head back in [inside],' he tells the marketing consultant, before the trailer ends. 

'I really hope it's not too late,' Bella is heard saying.
