Another essential part of her home makeover will be creating a mosaic of her face on the bottom of her swimming pool.

The Diva Forever star will be joined on the country estate by her parents Joan and Alan, who she is building a house next door for. 

So far she has purchased a dazzling unicorn statement, a grand piano which she plans to customise with crystals and a pink ostrich feather lamp.

The blonde apparently raked in £100,000 in just one day earlier this year through sales of her new sweatshirt after Jade was spotted wearing one.

In The Style reportedly flew the TOWIE favourite to the Greek island to get snaps of her latest clothing range.

A source told The Mirror: 'Gemma's made a mint for In The Style – her meme range was a sell out and stars like Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall have been seen in her designs.'

They continued: 'They were desperate to get Gemma on board for a whole collection and she signed on the dotted line without hesitation.

'Gemma is so into her fashion and she loves the team at ITS so it was a no-brainer. Gemma flew out to Greece at the start of this week to model her debut line.'

MailOnline contacted a representative of Gemma for comment.
