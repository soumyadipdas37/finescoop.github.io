She recently described lockdown as a 'blessing' as she continues to enjoy some downtime with her family.

And Rachel Riley appeared in great spirits as she shopped at American Vintage with her husband Pasha Kovalev and their baby daughter Maven, eight months, in Notting Hill on Friday.

The Countdown whizz, 34, looked radiant as she slipped into a grey playsuit and carried her little girl in an animal print sling during her outing.

Showcasing her lean legs, the mathematician's ensemble featured wide-leg shorts and a V-shaped neckline.

The blonde opted for comfort when it came to her footwear as she wore her favourite bedazzled trainers.

With her tresses pulled back into a bun, the TV star displayed her naturally clear complexion by going make-up free.

The former Strictly professional, 40, looked equally casual in a denim shirt and navy shorts.

Rachel and her little family have been spending the lockdown with her Russian mother-in-law Galina, whose month-long visit to the UK was extended amid the pandemic. 

The couple, who became first-time parents to Maven in December, have been enjoyed extended time off at home amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

Speaking on Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Lucy Horobin, the blonde recently admitted the countrywide lockdown has been something of a blessing for the family as they have been given 'enforced maternity and paternity leave'. 

The Oxford University alum said: 'Well we're quite fortunate in a way, I was supposed to be back at work, Pasha was supposed to be on tour, and it's kind of enforced maternity and paternity leave we didn't have before so we're loving it.

'She's just over five months, I've left her in bed in kind of the same sleeping position as Pash, if you hear crying it could be either one of them I have no idea.'
