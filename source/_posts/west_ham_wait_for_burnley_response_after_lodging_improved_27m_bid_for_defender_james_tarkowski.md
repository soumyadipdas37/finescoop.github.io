West Ham are waiting for Burnley to respond to their £27million offer for James Tarkowski, and are willing to increase it, after holding talks.

Moyes wants to strengthen his defence rather than move for another forward such as Brentford's Said Benrahma. 

Burnley value the defener at £50m and are determined to hold onto the defender.



The 27-year-old was courted by Leicester last summer and is set to be in demand again after a solid season for the Clarets, who finished 10th in the Premier League after performing impressively post-lockdown.

Yet it is thought Burnley currently have no intention of negotiating the release clause in Tarkowski’s contract, given the difficulty of buying a replacement of the same level if he is sold.

 the England international scored two goals in 40 club appearances last season.
