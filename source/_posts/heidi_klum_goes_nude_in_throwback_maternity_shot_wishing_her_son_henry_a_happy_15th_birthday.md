The 47-year-old previously revealed to Ocean Drive Magazine in late 2016 that she considers herself a nudist: 'I grew up very free... not hiding or feeling insecure about myself or my body.'

She captioned the maternity photo by Russell James: 'Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu 15 years ago today you came into the world . 

'I feel so proud you are a part of me . You are the twinkle in my eye and the love of my life Happy Birthday Henry ... may your birthday be as special today as you are'

Heidi also included a sweet backlit photo of herself holding a baby Henry in the birthday tribute.

It comes weeks after she requested an emergency hearing to allow her to take the kids to Germany, where she's filming Germany's Next Top Model.

But Seal reportedly prevented her from taking them, claiming in court documents that his ex had a 'hidden agenda' to move the kids.

The co-parents quickly came to a custody agreement, which allows Heidi to travel and Seal to see the kids.
