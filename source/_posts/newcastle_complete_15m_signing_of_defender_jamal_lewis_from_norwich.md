Newcastle have signed defender Jamal Lewis from Norwich for an undisclosed fee.

Lewis, 22, has agreed a five-year contract with the Magpies after the two clubs agreed a fee.

The former Liverpool target is said to have cost around £15million, but the deal could rise to £20m with add-ons.

Newcastle have signed defender Jamal Lewis from Norwich in a deal worth as much as £20m

Lewis, 22, has agreed a five-year contract with the Magpies after Norwich's relegation

Newcastle said on their official website: 'Highly-rated full-back Jamal Lewis has become Newcastle United's fifth signing of the summer after joining the Magpies from Norwich City.

'The Northern Ireland international has signed a five-year contract at St. James' Park after earning rave reviews for his performances last season despite the Canaries' relegation from the Premier League.'

Lewis, who started out at hometown club Luton before joining Norwich's academy in 2014, was a regular starter for Norwich in the Premier League last season.

Lewis was wanted by Liverpool earlier this summer but both clubs couldn't agree a fee

He made a total of 34 appearances in all competitions as Daniel Farke's side were relegated after one season in the top flight.

Lewis was wanted by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp earlier this summer but the Reds opted to sign Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos instead. 

Newcastle boss Steve Bruce added: 'Jamal is a very exciting prospect. I watched him flourish in the Championship two years ago and he made a real fist of it in the Premier League last season.'

Newcastle signed England striker Callum Wilson and Scotland winger Ryan Fraser, both from Bournemouth, on Monday.
