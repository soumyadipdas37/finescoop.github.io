Earlier this month the rumour mill went into overdrive when it was reported that The Bachelor's Bella Varelis had a fling with Cody Simpson.   

And on Tuesday, the 25-year-old marketing consultant finally revealed the truth about her relationship with the Australian musician.

Speaking on the podcast Life Uncut, Bella admitted she had a 'thing' with the 23-year-old heartthrob after meeting him at a bar on Valentine's Day in Sydney. 

'We had a little bit of a sleepover!' The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has finally revealed the truth about her relationship with Cody Simpson after rumours they had a fling 

'I might have had a thing with Cody, like one night, a very long, long, long time ago,' she said.  

'He bought me a rose and then slow danced with me around Mrs Sippy in Double Bay.'    

She then revealed that they had 'a little bit of a sleepover,' but insisted that it was only 'one night'.

'It was like one of things where you're like, "this is really cute, who is this guy?"' she added. 

'Literally that was it, it was just that one night - we had a little bit of a sleepover - but no that was literally it.' 

Bella was left heartbroken after Locky Gilbert chose her arch-nemesis Irena Srbinovska, 31, in the gut-wrenching finale of The Bachelor last week.

Meanwhile, Cody split from ex-girlfriend Miley Cyrus in August after ten months of dating.

Miley confirmed she'd split from Cody after less than a year of dating on Instagram, telling fans the pair are taking time apart to 'work on' themselves.

'Right now, two halves can't make a whole and we're individually just working on ourselves to become the people that we wanna be, like everybody else at this age,' she said.
