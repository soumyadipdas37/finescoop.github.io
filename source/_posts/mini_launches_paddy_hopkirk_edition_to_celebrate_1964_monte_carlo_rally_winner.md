Mini has unveiled a new limited edition model to celebrate the original car's greater motorsport achievement.

The Paddy Hopkirk Edition Cooper S is a nod to the Northern Irish racing driver who took victory at the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally - a win that catapulted the Mini to iconic status.

Just 100 examples will be available in Britain at a price of £27,405 and will replicate the original with a red-body white-roof paint scheme, spot lamps and the '37' racing number that donned the victorious machine some 56 years ago.

The original Mini, driven by Patrick 'Paddy' Hopkirk and co-pilot Henry Liddon, won the race in the lightweight vehicle, beating competitor in far more powerful machines

Patrick 'Paddy' Hopkirk, 87, clinched the first victory behind the wheel of the classic Mini Cooper S number 37 at the legendary rally event with with his English co-pilot Henry Liddon.

The achievement was seen as a landmark result, with the lightweight British car defeating competitors with much bigger and more powerful engines.

Like the original, the 100 celebration cars will don the now-famous '37' racing number on the driver's and passenger's doors

Paddy Hopkirk and co-driver Henry Liddon are the most recent all-British crew to have won the legendary Monte Carlo Rally

The surprise win in Monte Carlo made Paddy Hopkirk the UK's most famous rally driver overnight and the classic Mini advanced from outsider and crowd pleaser to becoming a motor racing legend, with the Mini's feat repeated in 1965 and 1967 in the hands of Hopkirk's Finnish team mates Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen.

The victory made Hopkirk a household name and his achievement saw him receive telegrams from the then UK Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home and the Beatles.

He was also given the Freedom of the City of Belfast, and appeared along with his Mini on Sunday Night at the London Palladium with Bruce Forsyth and was interviewed by the BBC's Raymond Baxter.

In the style of the historic rally winner, the edition model features a single white bonnet stripe on the driver's side which bears the signature of the 1964 racing driver

The car will likely appeal to Mini and rally fans and should have future-classic status given its very limited production output

The commemorative 2020 model is based on the standard Cooper S, which costs from £20,335 in the lowest specification, meaning a mark-up of more than £7,000 - a premium of 35 per cent.

In the style of the historic rally winner, the edition model features the car's start number 37 on the driver and passenger doors and a single white bonnet stripe on the driver's side which bears the signature of the 1964 racing driver. 

The rally-winner's famous number plate - '33 EJB' -  is also shown on the bonnet strip using 3D effect graphics.

Shortly after winning the race, Hopkirk was invited to appear - with his race car - on Sunday Night at the London Palladium

Mechanically, the Cooper S remains unchanged. That means it has a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder, petrol engine producing 192 horsepower, mated to a manual gearbox

It also gets 17-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels, a number of commemorative badges and a pair of spot lamps.

Inside, the celebration edition features the motorsport inspired Alcantara John Cooper Works steering wheel. 

Mechanically, the Cooper S remains unchanged. That means it has a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder, petrol engine producing 192 horsepower, mated to a manual gearbox.

That's enough power for the car to accelerate from 0-to-62mph in 6.8 seconds and hit a flat-out top speed of 146mph. 

The Mini Paddy Hopkirk Edition is available to order now with customer deliveries due to arrive in November.
