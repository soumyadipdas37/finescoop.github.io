Willow Smith has purchased a $3.1 million starter home in Malibu, not too far away from her famous parents Will and Jada's $42 million Calabasas mansion.

The Red Table Talk panellist, 19, who is best known for topping the charts with her hit single Whip My Hair in 2010, has finally followed in the footsteps of her older brother Jaden, who moved into a $4 million house in the gated enclave of Hidden Hills three years ago. 

Built in 2011, the contemporary property features a modest four bedrooms, a stylish concrete patio for dining with pals, and breathtakingly-beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean.

Her parents were at the centre of headlines over the summer as Girls Trip star Jada, 48, revealed she had an affair with singer August Alsina while she and her longtime partner were on a break.

During an explosive episode of Red Table Talk, the mother-of-two admitted she developed a friendship with August, 28, four years ago and was going through a 'difficult time' with Will. 

The shocking confessional came after both actors initially denied the Entanglements hitmaker's claims that the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air star gave him his blessing to have a relationship with his wife.

Hollywood royalty: The artist is the daughter of thespians Will, 51, and Jada, 48, who also share son Jaden, 22, (pictured together in 2016 with Trey, 27, the actor's only child with ex-wife Sheree Zampino)
