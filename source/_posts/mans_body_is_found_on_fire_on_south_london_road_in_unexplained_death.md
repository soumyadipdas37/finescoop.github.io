A man's body has been found 'alight' in a road in Mitcham just after 6am this morning.

The Metropolitan Police are investigating the man's death as unexplained and forensics have been spotted examining the scene today.

The force said officers were called to the scene after reports were made with concerns for someone's safety.

Officers were sent to the scene and, on arrival at Commonside East, they discovered the body of a man which was described as 'alight'.

Police say they are trying to locate the man's next of kin.

Witnesses say forensic officers from the police and fire service have been on scene throughout the day searching for evidence that may shed light on what happened.Â 

Tania Marszalek, 39, who lives on the road where the body was found, told the Sun: 'My dogs woke me up at around 6am.

'I was annoyed they had woken me up before my alarm and I checked outside to see what was going on - I saw a police officer tying a red tape cordon to the wing mirror of my car.

'I immediately wanted to know what was going on and I asked the officers who didn't tell me much at all.

'There are people on the street who are saying a guy was found at the end of the road on fire after being mutilated, he was still alive when he was found.'
