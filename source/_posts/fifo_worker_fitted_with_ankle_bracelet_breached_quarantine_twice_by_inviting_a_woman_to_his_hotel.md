A fly-in-fly-out worker had to be fitted with an electronic ankle bracket after allegedly breaching coronavirus hotel quarantine on multiple occasions.  

Thomas Forster, 35, arrived on a flight from Queensland to Western Australia and was directed to undergo mandatory self isolation for 14 days in the Perth suburb of Redcliff.

But police prosecutors told Perth Magistrates court on Wednesday the Fortescue Metals worker invited a woman in his hotel room twice between September 12 and 14, and later went out to a party where he 'mingled with a small group of people'.

He has been charged with four counts of failing to comply with a direction from the state's Chief Health Officer.

The court heard that police and health authorities decided to fit Forster with the monitoring device after it was revealed he had breached quarantine laws in South Australia on July 20.

Forster and two others were fined a total of $9,000 after faking an urgent medical emergency to sneak into across the South Australian border from the coronavirus hotspot Victoria.

They had received a police exemption to attend the Riverland General Hospital at Yamba Point to treat a fractured ankle, but the group never arrived. 

Forster was spotted the following day having a beer at the Mawsons Lake Hotel.     

The court was also told Forster failed to answer bail on March 13 in Victoria after two bail breaches stemming from 2018.

'After careful consideration of the circumstances of the breaches and the man's history, the State Emergency Co-ordinator formed a view that it was necessary to monitor his location during the quarantine period,' Police told the court, the West Australian reported.  

Forster, who was the second person in Western Australia ordered to wear an ankle bracelet while under hotel quarantine, did not enter a plea at the hearing.

Magistrate Joanne Andretich said the allegations are 'very serious' and banned Forster from being 1km from an airport unless travelling to his work site in the Pilbara.  

Magistrate Andretich also imposed several other bail conditions which included a $1000 personal undertaking and surety.  

Police have since removed Forster's monitoring device upon the completion of his quarantine period.

The matter will continue in court on November 2.
