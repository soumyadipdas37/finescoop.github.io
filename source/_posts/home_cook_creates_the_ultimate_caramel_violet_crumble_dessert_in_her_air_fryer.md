A home cook has created a decadent Violet Crumble dessert in her air fryer - complete with crushed caramel honeycomb, chocolate fudge and ice cream.

The Australian woman shared her simple recipe to bake a 'pizookie' - a cross between a pizza and a chocolate chip cookie - typically baked in a cast-iron skillet until gooey in the middle and crispy around the edges.

But instead of using an oven, she baked her Violet Crumble caramel-flavoured pizookie in her $69 Kmart air fryer.

'I saw Caramel Violet Crumble all over the news last week and I decided to get a little creative with the air fryer and made a pizookie,' she wrote in a Facebook group.

'The air fryer worked great and it turned out so delicious - soft and chewy on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. Makes two large cookies or four small ones.'

To make the dessert, she uses an electric beater to whip butter, sugar egg and vanilla until smooth.

Next, she adds the baking powder and flour, and combine the ingredients until a thick dough forms. 

She then stirs in the chocolate chips and crushed Violet Crumble Caramel before portioning out the dough into two large cookies or four small cookies.

The woman said she spreads the dough out evenly in a greased cake tin.

Last week, Violet Crumble unveiled a white chocolate caramel version of its iconic honeycomb treat for just $4.40 a pack

In a preheated air fryer, she baked the dough for eight to 10 minutes, until its gooey in the centre, and crispy around the edges.

Once the dough is cooked, remove from the air fryer and allow to cool for 10 minutes. To serve, she drizzled chocolate fudge, topped with ice cream and crushed Violet Crumble Caramel. 

Hundreds of people who saw her creation were impressed with the results, with many saying they couldn't wait to make it for themselves at home.

'That looks deliciously dangerous,' one woman said, while another added: 'Boy oh boy wowee this is a winner.'
