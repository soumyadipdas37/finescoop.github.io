'The two of them were having a lot of fun together at a table along with two other friends,' the insider told E!. 'Tomi and Jay were passing a bottle of tequila back and forth and taking shots together directly from the bottle. The two of them left together.'

Lahren acknowledged the rumors swirling around her and the former NFL quarterback in a tweet Thursday night, writing, 'I love it when the internet tells me who I’m dating. Good one.'

Another source told the outlet that Lahren and Cutler 'are just friends.'

Cutler retired in 2017 after a stint with the Dolphins, who he joined in the preseason that year after they lost then-quarterback Ryan Tannehill to injury. He was initially inked to be a Fox Sports color commentator before the opportunity arose in Miami.

'With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce,' Cutler and Cavallari said. 'We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of.'

Also this past April, the Never Play Dead writer and soccer player Brandon Fricke ended their engagement after more than a year together.







The potential love connection caused a stir on social media, with some joking about Cutler's past battles on the gridiron, with others referring to Lahren's outspoken political views 

'It just wasn't in the cards,' Lahren told People, adding that she and Fricke remained 'best friends.'

Geographically, the two celebs are in better position to bond, as Lahren recently moved to Nashville, where Cutler already resided.
