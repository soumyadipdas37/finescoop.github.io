She might be best known for playing Piper Willis on the long-running soap Neighbours.

But it seems Mavournee Hazel's Ramsay Street past is well and truly behind her judging by her latest role - and look - on Halifax: Retribution. 

In the new Channel Nine series, Mavournee has traded in her clean cut looks for a harder, grungier edge which includes a fresh new brunette 'do.

Speaking to Nine Now on Tuesday, she said: 'I didn't know how drastically it would change and shift the character for me, I'm so glad we did it.' 

Mavournee explained the transformation made it easier to get into character. 

'I had my first wardrobe fitting before the change of my hair and her wardrobe's really cool, but when we did my hair it was like, "Oh wow, here she is, here's Zoe."'

The young actress finished by saying she was 'grateful' for the overhaul, with it meaning she could also shed 'Piper'. 

Transformation: Zoe said: 'I had my first wardrobe fitting before the change of my hair and her wardrobe's really cool, but when we did my hair it was like, "Oh wow, here she is, here's Zoe."'

'I could look in the mirror and see Zoe and really have shed Piper. I don't hold any attachment to my hair or my vessel,' she said. 

'So I'm like, ''Change it away, shave it if you want, I don't mind,"' she finished. 

In the series, Mavournee will portray Jane Halifax's stepdaughter. When her father Ben dies, it puts their relationship on edge.

Mavournee played the role of Piper Willis on Neighbours from 2015 to 2019. 

While she mostly stayed out of the spotlight, she did speak about the pressure to emulate Margot Robbie to TV Tonight back in 2017.   

'I don't know if I will go to the UK or do the whole pilot season US and try to follow Margot's footsteps,' she said, speaking of her career trajectory.  

Halifax: Retribution airs Tuesday at 8.40pm on Nine and 9Now
