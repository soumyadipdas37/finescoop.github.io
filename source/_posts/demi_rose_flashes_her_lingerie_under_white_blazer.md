She rose to fame due to her voluptuous physique and stunning beauty. 

And Demi Rose sent temperatures soaring yet again as she flashed her lingerie in sizzling new Instagram snaps from her Ibiza getaway on Monday.

The influencer, 25, flashed a tease of her ample assets in a plunging white blazer that was cinched in at the waist highlighting her gorgeous curves.

Her recent post comes after the model emotionally discussed losing both her parents at the age 24 and how she copes with her ongoing grief.

She appeared on Sky News last week to talk to Kay Burley in a bid to raise mental health awareness on World Suicide Prevention Day.

Demi lost her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, and she went on to suffer another devastating loss as her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.  

Racy! The influencer has been sharing a slew of sexy snaps while in Ibiza and posted this sizzling bikini shot last week

Discussing losing both her parents at just 24-years-old, the model said: 'Well, my mother, when I was 17, she had a heart attack which caused a stroke and it left her disabled. 

'Then in 2018, my dad passed away from cancer, then my mum, after being sick for so long, she passed away from a stomach infection. So it was really hard.'

When asked how she copes with the grief, Demi said: 'I mean, it was really difficult, I've gone through stages of feeling my worst and now I'm at a place where I feel a lot better. It just takes time really.'  

'I have some amazing friends and I do meditation. I have a lot of faith, so I pray and do sound healing. I love sound healing.'
