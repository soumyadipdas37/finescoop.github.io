Newcastle are reportedly considering loan moves for Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah and Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster this summer. 

Steve Bruce has lost Dwight Gayle to a knee injury until at least December and only Andy Carroll has featured in recent warm-up matches for Newcastle. 

As such, Sportsmail revealed on Sunday that the Magpies have agreed a £20m fee for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson - but Bruce is still keen to strengthen and is keeping tabs on Nketiah and Brewster and their development at their respective clubs, according to The Telegraph.

Bruce is desperate for attacking reinforcements and is set to land his top target in Wilson, but he may continue to add to his squad given Gayle's long-term injury.  

Nketiah is currently on international duty and scored a hat-trick for England Under-21s against Kosovo last week. 

He spent half-a-season on loan at Leeds United in the Championship last season, before being recalled after Mikel Arteta's appointment as manager at the Emirates. 

The 21-year-old scored four goals in all competitions for Arsenal last season and was sent-off against Leicester post-lockdown.

Brewster, meanwhile, has scored three goals in two games in pre-season for Jurgen Klopp's side - but is yet to register in a competitive game for the Premier League champions. 

The 20-year-old went on loan to Swansea City for the latter-half of last season, and scored an impressive 11 goals as the Swans reached the Championship play-offs. 

Both players featured in the Community Shield last weekend, with Brewster's missed penalty in the shoot-out handing the season curtain-raiser to the Gunners at Wembley.
