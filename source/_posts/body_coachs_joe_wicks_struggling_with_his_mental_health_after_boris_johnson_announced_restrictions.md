Joe Wicks has revealed he is 'really struggling' with his mental health, after Boris Johnson addressed the nation with tighter restrictions on Tuesday night. 

The Body Coach star, 35, took to Instagram to tell his legions of followers he felt 'powerless, unmotivated and confused' about when life will get back to normal. 

Joe raised more than £500,000 for the NHS by hosting daily family workouts on his social media platform, called P.E with Joe during lockdown. 

Depressed: Joe Wicks has revealed he is 'really struggling' with his mental health, after Boris Johnson addressed the nation with tighter restrictions on Tuesday night

However, the fitness guru said he was feeling depressed himself after Boris imposed a set of new restrictions on Tuesday, including a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants, indoor sports subject to the Rule of Six, and people working from home where possible- all of which could last for six months. 

In an emotional video, Joe said: 'I've just finished watching the press conference with Boris Johnson around the new UK Covid restrictions.

'I can really feel for the first time this is starting to take effect now on my mental health, it's really bringing me down. I'm finding it hard to be optimistic, it's confusing.

Upset: The Body Coach star, 35, took to Instagram to tell his legions of followers he felt 'powerless, unmotivated and confused' about when life will get back to normal'

'I don't know where I stand and can't even comprehend where the end is. You know that feeling of powerlessness and confusion is quite a hard feeling to deal with.

'Normally we're in control of things and we can change things but with this, it's a realisation that this isn't going to away tomorrow is really getting me down.

'The one thing I love more than anything is being connected with community, my mum, dad, my family and friends. I love being around people.

Confused: 'I don't know where I stand and can't even comprehend where the end is. You know that feeling of powerlessness and confusion is quite a hard feeling to deal with,' he added

'All these things are disconnecting me from my work colleagues, family, from meeting in groups of friends.

'I understand why but it doesn't make it any easier and I think it's so important to talk about how you're feeling. Don't bottle it up. 

Joe went on to say he feels frustrated we have to take a step back after moving forward and is 'sensitive about other people knowing small businesses and restaurants that are going to go under'. 

'When I start thinking about that, that energy it brings me down so much,' Joe continued.

'Thanks for your honesty': The hunky personal trainer's fans soon flooded the comment section with messages of support

'I'm finding it hard to be excited about anything, I'm finding it hard to be motivated to film home workouts or do anything because it's so difficult to be optimistic.' 

Joe, who is father to daughter Indie, two, and son Marley, nine months, went on to drum home the importance of exercise and urged his followers not to give up on their physical health, because their 'mental health will deteriorate quicker'. 

The hunky personal trainer's fans soon flooded the comment section with messages of support.

Giovanna Fletcher wrote, 'Completely feeling this. So much love to you Joe. Xx', while Marvin Humes added: 'Well done for sharing this Joe it will help a lot of people..you’re a great man and inspire so many..big love'.

A third chimed: 'Thanks for your honesty Joe. Im feeling the same. I have a small business making wedding cakes etc and today has hit me hard. I was trying to be positive before, but this feels so much more difficult'.

It looks after the fitness expert's projects including his TV and books and online videos. The accounts show that the coach also had £343,838 cash in the bank.
