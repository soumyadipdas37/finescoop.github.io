ITV drama Des depicts the true story of British serial killer Dennis Nilsen and his murderous atrocities committed against men and boys between 1978 and 1983.

The broadcast regulators, Ofcom, have reportedly received seven complaints from viewers who were  left horrified by the disturbing details of his crimes in the three-part series, reports the Sun.

The TV drama documents Dennis - played by David Tenant - during his arrest and subsequent trial for the brutal murders of 15 young men, and launched to critical acclaim on Monday.

Des has given ITV it's biggest drama launch of the year after an average of 5.4 million viewers tuned in to watch. 

The first episode peaked at 5.9 million, however some fans were deterred by the chilling revelations of his crimes which included necrophilia and dismemberment, and they felt it warranted a complaint to Ofcom.

Other viewers took to Twitter to share their reaction as they became engrossed in the dark yet gripping storytelling of Dennis which unfolded on the small screen.

One viewer penned: 'Oh it's time to scare myself silly again Face screaming in fearwatching @itv #Des I'm hoping @TwiningsUK Sleeping symbol is going to help this evening #scared #itv #itvdes #tea #twinings #sleep.'

DCI Jay is in charge of the investigation into Dennis and is played by Ashes to Ashes actor, Daniel Mays. A viewer tweeted to the 42-year old actor and said: '@DanielMays9 Just watched Des, scared to go to sleep now!'

Another viewer added: 'I can attest that reading Dennis Nilsen's Wikipedia page before turning in doesn't make for a great night's sleep. #Des.'

MailOnline have reached out to Ofcom for further comment.

Dennis, who died at the age of 74 in 2018 at HMP Full Sutton, 34 years into his life sentence, is believed to have killed as many as 15 gay men, most of them homeless, at his homes in north London suburbs Cricklewood and Muswell Hill.

During his killing spree, Dennis would befriend his subjects in pubs and bars in London before luring them into his flat, where he would murder them and sit with their corpses before dismembering them.

His crimes were discovered when a drain outside his home on Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill, became blocked by human remains that he had tried to flush away.  

Dennis was jailed for life with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 25 years in 1983, on six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. The sentence was later upgraded to a whole-life tariff.
