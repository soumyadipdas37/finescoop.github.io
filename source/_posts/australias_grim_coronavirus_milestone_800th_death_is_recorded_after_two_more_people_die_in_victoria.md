Australia has now recorded 800 COVID-19 deaths after two more people died in Victoria amid fears a third wave will hit the embattled state.  

The new cases, confirmed by the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday, bring Melbourne's 14-day average down to 15.6.

There were also 19 mystery cases in Melbourne recorded in the two weeks between September 15 and 28.

Melbourne's 14-day average needs to drop below five and there must be fewer than five mystery cases in a fortnight before the state further eases restrictions.  

Premier Daniel Andrews has said this isn't likely to happen until October 19.

The grim milestone comes a day after the Victorian government stood down private security in the state’s remodelled hotel quarantine program and sent in police to guard people.

It shift followed a healthcare worker expressing concerns that contracted security guards could lead to further outbreaks that could trigger a dreaded third wave in Victoria.

More to come.
