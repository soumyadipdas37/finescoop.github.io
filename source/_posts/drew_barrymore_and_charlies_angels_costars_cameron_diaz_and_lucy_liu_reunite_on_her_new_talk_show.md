Drew Barrymore debuted her new daytime talk show to the world on Monday.

And the lifelong actress kicked things off with a bang, welcoming her dear friends and Charlie's Angels co-stars Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu along for the first episode.

While the trio was clearly delighted to reunite, Drew, 45, admitted there was a bit of a bump in the road when she accidentally sent her text message invite for the gals to a random 'young boy.'

Big premiere! Drew Barrymore reunited the Charlie's Angels gang for the premiere of her new daytime TV talk show on Monday

Whoops! The girls were delighted to be together, but Drew had to reveal how her original invitation text to Cameron accidentally got sent to 'a young boy' 

The 50 First Dates actress was full of love when she introduced her pals saying: 'I couldn’t begin this journey without two women who have been a part of my heart for over 20 years.'

'We are friends, we are fellow angels,' she went on about her 2000s era co-stars.

There was a bit of TV magic going on, making things look like all three were in studio together while actually split between an LA and NY shoot to socially distance per COVID-19 standards. Diaz was in LA while the other two were in NYC with a safe six-feet apart. 

But the pandemic wasn't the only hurdle the angelic reunion had to overcome.

Drew's sweet invitation to her friends didn't actually make it to the stars, and instead found its way to someone Barrymore described as a 'young boy.'

Return to sender? Before the reunion Drew tried to reach out to her friends, but her sweet text invitation strangely found its way to someone Barrymore described as a 'young boy'

'First I sent Cameron a video and I'm saying "Hey listen... I want to ask you something. Will you come on my show?' 

'...Because I'm so comfortable - I mean we have lived together all over the world -  so of course, to save time I sent her a video while I'm getting dressed.' 

Cameron and Lucy couldn't help but giggle as Drew continued.

'You don't see anything! I'm not that dumb,' she laughed, 'But I'm getting out of the shower and I'm ringing out of my towel.'

Strangely, Drew got zero response, prompting some concern.

'I don't hear back from her for like two days and I'm like "This is weird..."'

Strange... Drew said she was confused after Cameron kept her on read for 'two days,' so she called to check in

Can't help but giggle: Diaz burst into full laughter, as Drew revealed how the message went to someone completely random

After getting a bit 'freaked out' by the situation, Drew decided to call Cameron and see what's up.  

'So I call her and I'm like "What is going on? I'm worried. Is everything okay?"

But Cameron had no clue what Drew was even talking about.

'I'm like, "the video? You didn't get my video?" 

At that point, Diaz burst into full laughter, as Drew revealed how the message went to someone completely random.

'Turns out, a young boy watched the video,' Barrymore said with wide eyes.

'Lucky him!' Lucy chimed in.

Special delivery? 'Turns out, a young boy watched the video,' Barrymore said, prompting Lucy to chime in and say 'Lucky him!'

Extensive: Cameron was happy to provide a bit more context, revealing 'By the way, it's like seven minutes long... It's epic'

Cameron was happy to provide a bit more context, revealing 'By the way, it's like seven minutes long... It's epic.'
