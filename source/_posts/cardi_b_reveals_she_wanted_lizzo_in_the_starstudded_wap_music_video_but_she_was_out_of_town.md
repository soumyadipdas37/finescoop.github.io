Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's music video for WAP featured cameos from Kylie Jenner, Normani and Rosalia, among others. 

But it turns out the Bodak Yellow rapper wanted to add one more star to the video, Lizzo. 

The 27-year-old discussed the almost-collaboration in a recent interview with Hot 97. 

Missed chance: Cardi B revealed she wanted another cameo in the WAP video, by Lizzo, during an interview with Hot 97 

'I’m cool with Lizzo and everything,' she said. 'Like, we’ve been sending DMs to each other and all that. But she was on vacation and she wasn’t in town.'

The scheduling conflict partly unraveled Cardi's vision for the video. 

'I was like, "Oh my gosh," because I had a whole vision about how I want to see Lizzo and everything,' the I Like It hitmaker said. 

Adding: 'It was so important to me to include different women that are different races and come from different backgrounds, but are so powerful and influential.'

Kylie, Normani and Rosalia joined Mulatto, Sukihana and Rubi Rose to make appearances in the video. 

Since being released three weeks ago, the WAP video has amassed 33.4m views. 

The song spent two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first female rap collaboration to debut in the spot. 

It also received the most first week streams ever and became the most streamed track of 2020.

In the recent interview, Cardi also explained that she has been surprised by the backlash WAP, which stands for Wet A** P***y, has received for being explicit. 

Referring to Jacki-O's 2004 song P***y (Real Good) she said 'I just grew up listening to those types [of songs] and y'all think this is super, super, super nasty? I don't thing so.' 

She further defended the song last week, in an interview on the Kyle and Jackie O radio show. 

'It's like, no, of course, I don't want my child to listen to this song and everything, but it's like, it's for adults,' she said. '
