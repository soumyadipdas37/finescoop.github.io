Richard Caring and his wife Patricia welcomed the stars to their private members club Annabel's on Wednesday evening for a fundraising dinner.

'The king of clubs', who runs the iconic Ivy empire, hosted Rainforest Evening in aid of the Amazon at his Mayfair club.  

The businessman and restaurateur, 72, looked dapper as he arrived at the glitzy premises with Patricia, 39, who wowed in a glam gown.

Richard, who is worth an estimated £820million, looked dapper in a blue three piece suit and tie. 

Patricia, who wed Richard in 2018, stood out in her glittery green gown with a racy thigh-high split.

The couple posed for photos inside the club, which had been lavishly decorated with a rainforest theme.

Among the guests at the VIP fundraising dinner were Maya Jama who looked stunning in a tight white mini dress.

The evening was part of Rainforest Month at Annabel’s, with The Caring Family Foundation hosting in partnership with Rainforest Foundation US, dedicated to protecting the natural beauty and inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest.

The dinner was hosted to raise awareness of the importance of preserving and protecting the tropical rainforest and the indigenous people of the world’s rainforests in the their efforts to safeguard the area impacted by the recent wildfires. 

The Caring Family Foundation and the Rainforest Foundation US are raising funds for a reforestation project to grow, and plant, saplings in one of the most endangered areas of the Brazilian forest.

Caring owns the nation's most famous private members' club, Annabel's, as well as fashionable London restaurants including The Ivy, J Sheekey and the now defunct Le Caprice - which announced its shock closure last month.

Caring started his career in clothing, before buying the Caprice Holdings group for £31.5million in 2005. 

In 2018, he spent around £65million moving Annabel's– which was opened in 1963 by Mr Birley and named after his wife Lady Annabel Goldsmith – to a Grade I-listed townhouse two doors down on Berkeley Square.

The exclusive venue has witnessed the comings and goings of the creme de la creme of British society – with Princess Diana visiting for the hen night of Sarah, Duchess of York. 

The Queen also visited for the 70th birthday of her friend the Countess of Airlie in 2003.
