She recently launched a podcast documenting her IVF journey with her partner.

But it was back to business for Fiona Falkiner on Tuesday, as she took part in a photo shoot in Sydney suburb of Clovelly.

The 37-year-old model and TV presenter was spotted posing for the camera in a navy parka, which she teamed with a blue T-shirt and cropped jeans. 

Beaming beauty! Fiona Falkiner looked radiant during a photo shoot in Sydney on Tuesday. The 37-year-old was seen modelling a navy parka, with a blue T-shirt and cropped jeans

She oped for natural-look makeup, with only a hint of blush on her cheeks and matte pink lipstick.

Stylists later added a pair of sunglasses to her look, as production assistant holding a leaf blower helped Fiona achieve a perfectly windswept look. 

It was then time for an outfit change, and the former Biggest Loser host returned wearing a blue polka dot top with skintight jeans.

A stylist instructed Fiona to put on black espadrille sandals to complete the outfit. 

For her last outfit of the day, she kept the same pair of pants and changed into a striped blue shirt and black sandals.

Fiona's busy at work comes after she recently discussed her IVF journey calling it 'traumatic' and 'lonely'.

She recently told The Daily Telegraph: 'Obviously you have your partner, but it can actually feel like a really lonely process'.

'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'

In the same interview, her fiancée Hayley Willis, 30, revealed that she also hopes to carry a baby once Fiona has given birth.

Hayley said: 'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best. 

'I will give it a crack after we have our first child.' 

Last month, the couple launched their podcast, What the IVF?!, which will document their fertility journey as a same-sex couple.

Fiona and Hayley announced their engagement in April 2019, after 10 months of dating.

The romantic proposal took place at sunset on a private beach at The Moso resort in Vanuatu, with Hayley presenting her partner with a diamond ring.

The women will tie the knot later this year in an intimate wedding ceremony.
