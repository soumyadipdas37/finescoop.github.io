Two RAF Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a passenger jet that landed at Stansted airport after 'suspicious objects,' were found in an onboard toilet. 

Armed police surrounded a Laudamotion flight after it landed at the Essex airport at around 7.20pm on Sunday.

Passenger Joanna Czechowska said Essex Police had boarded and taken two men off the flight after 'suspicious objects,' were found in the toilets.

A spokesman for London Stansted Airport confirmed a plane had landed safely on the ground following a police incident. 

Passengers on board say the plane parked up in a 'remote area,' before it was surrounded by armed police from Essex constabulary. 

It's understood police have now stood down from the scene. 

Both Typhoons circled over the airport several times, before the passenger flight had landed at the scene.

Flight radars spotted both jets flying down to the Essex airport from their base at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire

The jets are thought to have then headed in the direction of Cheltenham to be refueled, before appearing to return towards base at RAF Coningsby.

There were claims the jets were responding to an urgent call-out known as a Quick Reaction Alert, or QRA. 

MailOnline has approached the Ministry of Defence and Essex Police for comment.
