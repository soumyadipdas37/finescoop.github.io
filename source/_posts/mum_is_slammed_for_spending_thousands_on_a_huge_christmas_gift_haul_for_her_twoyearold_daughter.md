A super organised mother has been slammed for 'spoiling' her two-year-old daughter after she splashed out thousands of dollars on a massive haul of Christmas gifts. 

The woman, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, shared a picture on social media showing a mountain of presents she had already purchased for her toddler girl.

The photograph shows dozens of toys - including a Frozen castle playset, dolls, Toy Story figurines, Play-Doh, board games and inflatable pool toys.

Despite the huge collection, the mother-of-one insisted she has more toys to add under the Christmas tree, including a Barbie Dream House playset, bike, trampoline and a Paw Patrol plush 'ride on'.

 Is this too much for a two-year-old?

'My Christmas stash for little miss two and still have about $1,500 in laybys to pick up,' she wrote in a Facebook group.

'Love you my little princess.'

Many parents were impressed with the 'kind and generous' mother for being well organised ahead of December 25. 

However, some were quick to criticise her for the extreme present haul.

'That's ridiculous for a two-year-old,' one parent said, while another added: 'You're setting her up for disappointment. Trust me.'

One person suggested the mother should have set up a bank account for her daughter so she could use the funds on university expenses, a car or even a house when she's older.

But many quickly defended the mother's efforts, with one saying she does 'exactly the same' for her one child as they are 'only little once'.

Another woman defended the mother, saying she does 'Christmas like this too' for her daughter, as she shared a snap of her little girl's present haul 

Others said they enjoy 'spoiling' their children for Christmas, while others fired back at critics, saying it's 'no one else's business' how much parents spend on their kids.

'So what? I've gone all out for my three kids this year. They've missed out on so much because of COVID, my daughter's first year of school and she's missed so much as well as my second grader and toddler. The least I can do is spoil them for Christmas,' one woman said.

Another said: 'At least this mother is keeping her child entertained with lots of toys to play with good on her. Most parents nowadays chuck their kids on the iPad.'

One woman added: 'I used to buy like this for my kid and I still sometimes do. It's none of anyone's business if she wants to waste her money on toys there are much worse things she could waste it on. She's just a great mum who cares for her kid.'

And a fourth woman said: 'While I would never buy this much for my children in one go at any age, it's no one else's businesses how much other people spend on their kids and if she's got the money to do it then so be it.'
