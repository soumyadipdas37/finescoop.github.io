Home and Away star Luke Jacobz is charging fans $55 for personalised videos on celebrity messaging site Cameo.

The 39-year-old Australian actor shared a brief introduction clip to the popular website where he said he 'can't wait' to send his followers video messages.

The platform allows starstruck fans to fill in a form asking celebrities to film a personalised message, often wishing their loved ones a happy birthday or just saying a quick hello, for a set fee.

Luke has already received a five-star review and responds within three days, according to the website.  

The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a decrease of acting gigs for celebrities, leaving many to ponder over side hustles such as Cameo shoutouts. 

He recently reprised his role as Angelo Rosetta on Home and Away after almost a decade away.
