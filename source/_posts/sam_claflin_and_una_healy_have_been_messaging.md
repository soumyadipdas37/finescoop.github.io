Sam Claflin and singer Una Healy have been 'messaging quite a bit' after the pair 'matched on a celebrity dating app' and are 'hoping to meet up for a date'. 

The Hunger Games actor, 34, and The Saturdays star, 38, are understood to have 'a lot in common' and plan to meet in person when their busy schedules 'align'.  

Una divorced from husband Ben Foden, 35, with whom she has Aoife, eight, and Tadhg, five, in 2018 after four years of marriage when he confessed to cheating.

A source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Una and Sam have a lot in common. They've been messaging quite a bit and are hoping to meet up for a date when they can align their schedules.' 

Sam split from actress Laura Haddock, 35, in August 2019 following six years of marriage and the couple share four-year-old Pip and two-year-old Margot. 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Una and Sam for comment. 

Announcing their split last year, Sam wrote on Instagram: 'Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together.'

'We won't be commenting on this further. Thank you in advance for your support and respecting our privacy at this time.

'Both of us x. (sic)'

However Laura has since struck up a romance with Tom Rhys-Harries, 27, whom she met on the set of Netflix series White Lines, where they played siblings Zoe and Axel Collins.

And Una's ex Ben has since found love again after he tied the knot with his new wife Jackie Belanoff Smith in August 2019 and on the same day his divorce from Una was granted.

Admitting the move wasn't 'very respectful', the rugby player said recently: 'I hold my hands up and say, it was wrong. 

'My final decree didn't even come through until the morning of us getting married. 

'People will say I wasn't very respectful in what I did, getting married to Jackie very quickly, but you can't help the heart and we've got past it.' 

Moving on: Una admitted she found her ex-husband Ben Foden's marriage to Jackie Belanoff Smith (pictured last August) a 'big shock'
