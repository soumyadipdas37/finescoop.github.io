Mark Schwarzer believes N'Golo Kante's all-action nature on the pitch has caught up with him but has backed the Frenchman to bounce back for Chelsea this season.

The 29-year-old was limited to just 28 appearances for the Blues last season, with minor injuries keeping him sidelined after featuring in 53 matches during the previous campaign.

Sportsmail revealed last week that Chelsea had rejected a swap deal with Inter Milan involving Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic for Kante.

Kante made just 28 appearances for Chelsea last season as minor injuries kept him sidelined

And should the France star stay at Stamford Bridge, former Blues goalkeeper Schwarzer remains adamant he can step his performance up again for the club having previously pushed his body too far.

'I'm a massive fan of Kante, I think he's a phenomenal player,' Schwarzer - who was the Frenchman's team-mate at Leicester - told Goal.com.

'His rise to stardom has been well documented and having been with him for that one season at Leicester, it was a joy to be there, watching and playing with him.

'I think it's all just caught up with him physically because he's a player that's very mobile, does a lot of work all over the pitch, it's taken its toll.Â 

But former Blues goalkeeper Schwarzer has also backed the Frenchman to shine this season

'He's played a lot of the time with little niggling injuries and he's played through the pain barrier and I think last season it caught up with him a lot. He struggled to get any real consistency in terms of game time because of his injuries.

'I hope this season after the coronavirus break he has hopefully given his body time to recover and hopefully get things right physically. If he can do that he'll be a massive asset for Chelsea. I hope they keep hold of him.'

If Frank Lampard gets his wish the club will be retaining the services of the World Cup and two-time Premier League winner.

The Blues rejected a swap deal from Kante's former boss Antonio Conte and Inter Milan

The Blues boss has said Kante is 'fundamental' to his plans and that he has no intention of selling him despite reports the club could cash in on him.

'I think pretty much every club in the world would want N'Golo Kante,' Lampard told BBC Radio 5 Live earlier this week.

'I have seen those reports as well. He is an incredible player and person and I certainly don't want to lose him. He's fundamental in terms of what I'm trying to do.

And Lampard insists Kante remains 'fundamental' to his squad and does not wish to sell him

'We can obviously talk about the attacking players we have but someone like N'Golo and the work he does in midfield... It was a difficult year for him last year because of the injuries.

'He came into the season with an injury and it was a domino effect through the year. It was probably a culmination of four or five years of games, so I'm really excited to have him fit. He looks fresh, he's a big deal to me.

'Of course I want to keep N'Golo.'
