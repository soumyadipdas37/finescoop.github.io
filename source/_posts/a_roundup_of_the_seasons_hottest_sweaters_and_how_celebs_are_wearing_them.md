Today marks the official start of the fall season. 

As the sun gives way to a cool breeze, it's time to bust out the pumpkins and cozy blankets, think about your Halloween costume and pick up a few new sweaters.

Sure, a collection of chunky knits that go with everything is a must, but this season's trendiest offerings are far from basic.

From cropped turtlenecks to sweater coats and preppy cardigans, FEMAIL rounds up the styles you need now.

Show a little skin: For a fresh dose of sartorial inspiration, turn to Hailey Bieber who stepped out yesterday looking incredibly chic (and warm!) in a black cable-knit turtleneck sweater that hit above her waist

Cropped turtleneck 

Cropped silhouettes are no longer reserved for spring/summer. 

With high waist denim being hotter than ever, it's no surprise that belly baring sweaters are in this season, too.

Not sure how to pull it off? 

For a fresh dose of sartorial inspiration, turn to Hailey Bieber who stepped out yesterday looking incredibly chic (and warm!) in a black cable-knit turtleneck sweater that hit above her waist.

The supermodel accessorized her off-duty look with black high heel boots, small hoop earrings and a scrunchie casually tied in her hair.

Sweater coat

A sweater coat is the perfect outer layer until temperatures start to really drop.  

In place of a jacket, Jennifer Lopez was seen in Manhattan last week wearing a thick cardigan made of a cashmere blend. 

The sweater by Italian luxury fashion brand Brunello Cucinelli featured a multicolor pattern, deep neckline and snap buttons.

She wore the garment open exposing the waistband of her paperback pants (also by Brunello) and a white tank top. 

A black Hermes purse, Balmain boots and Fendi sunglasses completed the superstar's designer ensemble.

A little prep: What was once reserved for Catholic School girls or the country club, is now being worn by some of the hottest street style stars, including fashion icon Olivia Palermo

Preppy cardigan

What was once reserved for Catholic School girls or the country club, is now being worn by some of the hottest street style stars, including fashion icon Olivia Palermo.   

Sure, a collection of comfy knits in a solid color are a fall must, but a multicolored preppy cardigan that reminds you of childhood can be incredibly comforting during a time of uncertainty.  

Carry out the polished look with a pair of tailored pants, a crossbody bag and loafers like the New York-based fashionista.
