An Australian mother-of-three has shocked the internet after revealing how dirty the carpets in her home really were - despite vacuuming regularly.

Mum Kate shared images on Facebook of the dirt, dust and hair accumulated inside her new Dyson vacuum that was hiding within the carpet.

Online she said she was both 'horrified and impressed' to discover how well the vacuum worked at cleaning the filthy carpet. 

'Our master bedroom was vacuumed with our old Dyson Big Ball Animal three days ago. This morning I tried out our new Dyson V10+ Animal Stick and this is what came out of the carpets!' Kate said.

The image of the disgusting amount of dirt validates the need to use a good quality vacuum when cleaning the carpets.

'No wonder our new babies have been waking up congested,' Kate said, adding: 'We have one big dog, I can't believe she even has any fur left on her body at this point.'

The Dyson Cyclone V10 Animal+ vacuum retails for $899 at The Good Guys, Catch and on the Dyson website and is built with a powerful suction.

Another mum who owns a similar vacuum (pictured) said she's just as surprised at how much filth carpets can hide 

Hundreds of other mums part of the Facebook cleaning group were just as horrified at the end result, and those who also own the same vacuum agreed it works wonders.

'Oh wow! I just got the V11 yesterday I'm scared to use it for what I may find,' one woman said.

'It's unbelievable how much they pick up even when the floor looks clean,' another said.

A third added: 'I'm so glad I have no carpet!'
