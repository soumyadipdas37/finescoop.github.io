Surfing superstar Stephanie Gilmore was left shaken after her accused stalker allegedly approached her at a competition over the weekend. 

The seven-time world champion was competing at the Tweed Coast Pro at Cabarita in northern NSW on Sunday when Squires Winter allegedly spoke to her. 

Gilmore had been unloading her board from her car when the 66-year-old man allegedly appeared beside her, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Mr Winter is banned from looking for the surfer or going within 500m of her after Gilmore took out an personal violence order to be protected from him in May.

Mr Winter began the conversation, saying: 'Hi how are you?'

Gilmore did not recongise him at first and responded saying 'great, thank you'.

Mr Winter then mentioned 'catching up later'. Gilmore said they would not be and went to leave. 

Mr Winter then allegedly said: 'We are going to catch up later, aren't we?'

Gilmore said no and walked away. She later told police she was left feeling unsafe.

Mr Winter, who lives in Glenreagh, northwest of Coffs Harbour, was allegedly found by police at midday about 50m from the car park of the event.

He allegedly told police he had been on his way to Brisbane when he stopped to use the bathroom and saw Gilmore.

He told police he understood the protection order prevented him from approaching Gilmore. 

Mr Winter appeared in Tweed Heads Local Court via audio-video link on Tuesday where he pleaded not guilty to contravening  a protection order.

Police prosecutor Sergeant Chris Martin said Mr Winter's story 'did not make any sense' as he knew he would not be able to cross the border due to coronavirus restrictions. 

During the bail application hearing, Sgt martin said there were extreme concerns for Gilmore's welfare and Mr Winter had a long history of violence. 

Mr Winter was denied bail, with Magistrate Geoff Dunley citing his long history of violence, and previous breaches of AVOs. 

His decision to deny bail was also due to Mr Winter travelling a lengthy distance  to breach the order, which he found indicated 'fixated behaviour and some degree of planning'.
