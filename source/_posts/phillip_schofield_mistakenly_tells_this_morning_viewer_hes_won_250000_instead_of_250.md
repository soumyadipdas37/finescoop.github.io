Phillip Schofield stunned This Morning viewers on Tuesday, when he mistakenly informed a viewer that he'd won £250,000 instead of £250.

The 58-year-old presenter was joined by his co-host Holly Willoughby, 39, as they conducted the ITV show's popular Spin To Win competition.

And while no participant has ever scooped hundreds of thousands of pounds, Phillip mistakenly announced one caller had won the princely sum along with a holiday.

Although Phillip later clarified that the gargantuan sum was an unfortunate slip of the tongue, viewers took to Twitter to share their amusement over the gaffe.

Wrote one viewer: 'When @Schofe tells a poor fella ringing in for a competition on #ThisMorning that he’s won a #UK #Staycation and £250,000 only to then tell him he’d made a mistake and it was actually £250!'

'Don’t think he won £250,000 looool,' tweeted another, while a third stated: '£250,000?! They’d go bankrupt!'

The competition was far from a smooth ride on Tuesday, as another viewer narrowly missed out on taking part because he didn't answer his phone correctly.

As part of the rules, entrants were required to answer their phones saying 'belle of the ball' once called by the show, in order to advance further.

However, one viewer answered his phone with 'belle of the belle', leaving Phillip and Holly scratching their heads about what to do next.

Phillip bellowed across the studio: 'What do we do? Adjudicator, adjudicator? Oh my God, they're saying move on. Sorry... bye.'

The harsh decision prompted Holly to admit: 'I can't bear that, that was so close!'

Earlier in the show, Phillip took a friendly jab at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award.

The chat show, hosted by Phillip and Holly, took home the gong for Best Daytime Show with Alison Hammond, 45, presenting the award to the pair on Monday.

With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying after his win: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!'

Alison made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She said: 'This Morning has won a TV Choice Award for Best Daytime TV show everyone. It’s in the oven. 

'Because of Covid, there’s no award show or anything. This is the fifth one we’ve won now. We’ve beat GMB, Piers Morgan, Loose Women, The Chase.

Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers.'

Alison admitted she thought This Morning won the prize due to their coverage of the Covid-19 crisis.

She said: 'This is due to COVID why we’ve got this and we do deserve it. We do.'
