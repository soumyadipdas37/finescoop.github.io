The swimwear designer struck a series of poses while she let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders. 

Alongside the video, she wrote: 'Barcelona Bikini I designed. Made in London. Yeh just dancing @kimberleylondon'. 

Kimberley also took to her Instagram Stories and shared a clip of herself posing in a blue bikini with a white floral print.  

As she returned from European hot spot St Tropez last month, the model revealed that she tested negative for COVID-19.

Kimberley was able to return to the UK just before the new quarantine restrictions were enforced which requires all tourists to self isolate for two weeks following her trip abroad. 

She penned on Instagram: '@kimberleylondon bikini 2 weeks ago in a now closed France. On the last night I decided to not go to a party, so tempting.

'A small gentle voice in my tummy said not to, and I listened. I believe in God, this gentle feeling. I'm the only person back who is COVID-19 negative. Trust that little feeling.'

Earlier this summer, Kimberley was pictured with Made In Chelsea co-star Ollie Chambers, after enjoying a tennis session together.

Although Kimberley recently revealed that she has been having a 'great' time dating, she confirmed to MailOnline in July that her relationship with Ollie is purely platonic.

It came after she revealed she cancelled a secret wedding and ended a long-term relationship last summer.
