Malin Andersson put on a brave face on Wednesday as she arrived at a photoshoot in London after her abusive ex Tom Kemp was jailed last Thursday.

The Love Island star, 27, appeared in great spirits as she smiled at her mobile phone before heading into a studio for another day of work.

Showcasing her signature sleek style, the body confidence advocate carried her essentials in a monogrammed suitcase as she parked her vehicle in a car park in the English capital.

The online influencer looked typically chic as she highlighted her curves in a cream ribbed maxi dress, complete with a thigh-high slit.

Opting for comfort, Malin strolled along in a pair of cosy sandals before switching into a more glamorous outfit for her shoot.

The mental health campaigner was camera-ready when it came to her hair and make-up, as she styled her shoulder-length tresses in bouncy waves and complemented her beauty with a neutral-toned palette.

A dainty gold necklace, a light anklet and aviator shades rounded off the reality star's appearance.

Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on Thursday after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Speaking after his conviction this month, a friend of Malin told The Mirror: 'Her nightmare is over at last.'

The media personality told a friend she 'couldn't move for about two weeks' after the attack.

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief. 

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety.

'The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
