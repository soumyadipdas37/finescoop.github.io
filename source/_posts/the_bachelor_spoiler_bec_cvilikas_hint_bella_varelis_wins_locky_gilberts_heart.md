Bec Cvilikas has accidentally let slip a a major clue about who wins The Bachelor this season. 

Speaking to The Kyle And Jackie O Show on Thursday, the 25-year-old Bachelor reject appeared to reveal a spoiler when she admitted Bella Varelis, 25,  won't be watching the finale with her - despite them being flatmates.  

'We won't be [watching together], no. We'll be separate tonight,' she confessed.  

When asked why, Bec coyly replied: 'Oh, you know... we're just going to watch it separately. Emotional one for everyone tonight I imagine. It's going to be very full on.'   

This left Jackie wondering whether Bella will watch the finale with with Locky instead - therefore making Bella the winner.   

'You're screwing with me, because when you said you weren't going to be watching with Bella tonight, it made me think, 'Oh my god, that means Bella's watching with Locky!'' Jackie exclaimed. 

The Bachelor SPOILER: Dumped Bec Cvilikas, 25, slipped up on live radio this Thursday when she revealed Bella Varelis, 25, won't be watching the finale with her - despite them being flatmates 

Hmm! 'We won't be [watching together], no. We'll be separate tonight,' Bec told The Kyle And Jackie O Show on Thursday 

Bella winning would come as a surprise to many viewers, as rival Irena Srbinovska, 31, has long been tipped as the bookies' favourite to win.  

However, Bec muddied the waters later in the interview by claiming that she and Bella 'will probably continue living together' in their Sydney share-house even if Bella wins - despite the fact that Locky lives in Perth. 

It is very telling that Bec believes Bella would rather live with her than move to Perth for Locky. 

Major hint? This left Jackie wondering whether Bella will watch the finale with with Locky instead - therefore making Bella the winner

Locky tells the cameras: 'I thought I would come here and meet one person that I like and then end up together. But I found two!'  

'They are two of the most incredible women that I've ever met in my entire life.'
