She's faced a difficult few months after announcing her split from Taite Radley back in July.

And on Tuesday, Ali Oetjen broke down in floods of tears in a devastating video on Instagram, as she attempts to move on from her boyfriend of two years. 

Alongside heartbreaking footage of herself wiping tears from her mascara-stained eyes, the 34-year-old admitted she 'still loves' her ex - but added that she 'knows we don't align'. 

Brave: On Tuesday, Ali Oetjen (pictured) broke down in tears in an emotional video on her Instagram page as she vowed to show fans 'all parts' of her emotions - even at her lowest points

'You always see happy me. This is me today & has been my daily occurrence since my breakup,' she wrote.

'It’s bloody slow healing, sadness & hurt fill my whole body. Meditation, Yoga, exercise, nature, cooking, family, friends and focusing on my goals allows for my peaceful spirit to just be.

'I’ve never experienced anything like this where my soul still feels connected, I still love but know we don’t align.'

Normal: Ali continued by saying she wanted to normalise showing her emotions - high or low - online, in order for her fans and herself to grow into a stronger person

She went on to say that anyone going through a break-up is 'not alone'. 

'I want to share this to inspire strength in you, as you do me, because I know you’re also going through a break up or you’re finding it extremely tough atm in these huge world changes & darkness we’re being exposed too,' she continued. 

'WE ARE GROWING STRONGER, AWAKENING to PURGE THE HATRED & are ASCENDING to be FREED FROM CONDITIONAL PATTERNS & CAN THEN BE DIRECTED BY OUR SOULS.'

So sad: Alongside heartbreaking footage of herself wiping tears from her mascara-stained eyes, the 34-year-old admitted she 'still loves' her ex - but added that she 'knows we don't align' 

She signed off with the message: 'We’re all equal beings & hopefully by now waking up to our true essence, our true nature which is only LOVE. 

'When you follow me, view my pics/vids/see me on the street, look into my soul as I do yours & know we’re the same.' 

The video comes just weeks after the couple made the break-up announcement at the end of July.

The pair - who had been separated for 88 days prior to their split due to the coronavirus pandemic - said that they were 'taking time apart' and giving each other 'some space'.

'It is with the heaviest heart that we want to let everyone know that we have decided to take time apart in order to give each other space and time to fully focus on our own paths,' Ali wrote.

'We both love each other deeply and only want the best for each other and both want the ultimate happiness for each other and hopefully our paths will reconnect again soon.'

She added: 'We've decided to be open with this so there's no speculation and so we expect love, respect and kindness in return. I love you Taite.'
