She's an advocate for sustainable fashion, and Cate Blanchett has been leading by example at this year's Venice Film Festival.

The 51-year-old actress has been recycling her outfits from past years, stepping onto the red carpet in previously worn ensembles.

Last week, the Oscar-winning star shone in a floor-length shimmery navy blue Esteban Cortazar gown, which she'd previously worn for the 2015 London premiere of Carol.

The next night, she stepped out in an intricately designed floral top, which she paired with black trousers. 

The top was originally part of an Alexander McQueen dress she wore to the BAFTA Awards back in 2016.

She also recycled a pair of white trousers, opting to wear them multiple times while at this year's film festival.

Cate was also spotted in a blue tie-dyed jumpsuit by Triple RRR, which she'd previously worn during the 2019 press junket for Where'd You Go, Bernadette. 

The Ocean's 8 actress also recycled an Acne Studios embroidered tuxedo she'd worn to the Rome Film Festival in 2018, swapping the white shirt for a black one.

In a post on Instagram last week, Cate's longtime stylist, Elizabeth Stewart, said the actress had made a conscious decision to rewear some of her past outfits.

'IT'S CHIC TO REPEAT! #CateBlanchett has decided to rewear some of her most cherished looks at this year's Venice Film Festival... In her words, Beautiful things can come out of sustainability!' she explained.

She later said the actress was 'committed to a sustainable red carpet' and was doing this by 're-working past iconic looks', before auctioning them off for charity.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in May 2019, Elizabeth said sustainability was 'the most absolute important thing in the fashion industry right now'.

Sustainability: Cate spoke about choosing to be mindful with her fashion choices in an interview with WWD last month

Cate spoke about choosing to be mindful with her fashion choices in an interview with WWD last month. 

'The language around climate change is always around sacrifice, not around possibility... And beautiful things can come out of sustainability,' she explained.

She added: 'When you know the world is consuming 18 billion pieces of clothing a year, which is up 400 per cent from a decade ago, you think, this is not working.'
