Sheffield United are reluctant to meet Liverpool’s asking price for Rhian Brewster and have offered a loan leaving the door open for Crystal Palace.

The 20-year-old was left out of Liverpool’s matchday squad for the Carabao Cup tie at Lincoln City on Thursday night, fueling speculation of an imminent move.

Blades manager Chris Wilder had held talks with Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp but Brewster's future remains in limbo.

Crystal Palace are also admirers, but are yet to make an approach for a player valued at £25m by Liverpool, who insist on a buy-back option being included in any deal.

Brewster is in demand after scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances during a loan spell at Swansea City last season, which included several stunning strikes.  

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is an admirer of Brewster's talents but can't promise him regular game time with a formidable forward line of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah.

Forward Diogo Jota has also just been signed from Wolves.

Klopp handed the 20-year-old a rare substitute appearance in extra-time during the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal at Wembley, but Brewster missed his penalty in the shoot-out. 

That could now be his last appearance in a Reds shirt.

Klopp may also be loking to recoup some of the £66m spent on midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Jota last week.
