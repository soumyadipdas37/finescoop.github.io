Kaley Cuoco has recently returned to work on her upcoming drama series The Flight Attendant, as Hollywood gets back to business amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the California-born actress still has plenty of time for her loved ones, as she enjoys some socially-distanced company.

She spread 'love' Sunday in a casual chic activewear look, as she stepped out for a walk with her sister Briana in New York City, while enjoying her day off from production.

The 34-year-old donned a white t-shirt printed with 'love' in multi-colors, paired with some skintight black leggings.

She finished the look with a black baseball cap, matching face mask and a pair of neon orange and pink Nike trainers.

Kaley carried her iPhone on a black leather crossbody strap, which came complete with utility pockets.

Briana, 31, kept it cute in a grey tank top with a pair of skintight high-waisted faded jeans and white Nike kicks.

She captioned the photos: 'We’re back!! Keeping our distance of course! ...Time to land this [airplane emoji]!'

The suspenseful drama series went on hiatus back in March, as the COVID-19 lockdown forced Hollywood to temporarily shut down.

Production previously wrapped on all international locations, with about three episodes left to shoot, which will all film in New York City.

Kaley executive produces and stars as Cassie, a flight attendant who wakes up in a strange place with a dead man in her bed and no recollection of what happened.

She also shared a masked-up selfie over the weekend with costar Zosia Mamet, writing: 'Friends that get covid tested every few days , wear masks, take necessary pre-cautions, listen to production rules , wash hands all day long and respect the process together, get to act together @zosiamamet

'this picture was taken right before we shot today’s scene in a very structured quarantined environment. Very proud of our cast and crew at #theflightattendant and everyone @warnerbrostv & @hbomax for making this possible for us!'

The Big Bang Theory star revealed last month on Instagram that she was returning to work on her new show.

She said in a video: 'The first update would be that I am going back to work! So my sister, me and my trusty assistant Emma go back to New York on Monday. And we have to quarantine – I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff on social media about our quarantine.

'We'll be quarantined for two weeks and you'll get a look at our shenanigans, I'm sure. And then back to work. We only have like two and a half episodes left, so I'm going to wrap up by the beginning of October.'

The show, which is expected to premiere in November, is based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian.

Kaley continued: 'I don't have an exact date but that is exciting at all in itself. I don't know if you guys know this but I have been working on this project for three years. 

'It goes back to three years from when I actually found the original book, so it's very exciting for me, and then obviously developing it for over two years.'
