He put on a loved-up display with his new girlfriend Katie Holmes earlier in the week.

But Emilio Vitolo Jr. was on his own on Wednesday as he picked up some essential items at a drug store in New York City.

The 33-year-old chef was attired in a minimalist outfit comprised of neutral colors as he took care of his shopping.

Vitolo looked sleek in a brilliant white dress shirt, which he wore unbuttoned over a white T-shirt.

He darkened his look with a pair of charcoal trousers that were rolled up above his ankles to show off his white sneakers.

The restaurateur matched his clothing to his white driving cap, and he also wore a white mask to guard against the coronavirus.

Vitolo carried around a small bag from CVS and a stick of deodorant as he crossed the street.

The chef was just on a break from work and returned to his restaurant after making his purchases.

He serves as the chef at the popular Italian restaurant Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan, a family business owned by his father Emilio Vitolo Sr.

In its positive review of Emilio's Ballato, New York Magazine noted the restaurant has a 'clubby' atmosphere, partly due to Emilio Sr., who decides which customers gets a table and in what order they'll be served from his regular table at the front of the restaurant.

Despite the insular style, plenty of celebrities have been drawn to the restaurant's classic Italian dishes, including former President Barack Obama and Hollywood stars Tom Hanks and Bradley Cooper.

Emilio and his actress girlfriend Katie Holmes, 41, were first linked on September 1, while on an apparent date at Mediterranean restaurant Antique Garage in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.

But the romantic nature of their relationship was unveiled later that week, when they were spotted kissing passionately at Manhattan's Peasant Restaurant.

The relationship seems to be a drastic change from Katie's previous MO, as she's been unabashedly open about her new beau.

In contrast, she began dating fellow actor Jamie Foxx, 52, in 2013, but the two kept their relationship private for years until going public at the Met Gala in May 2019, shortly before they broke up.

The Dawson's Creek star can now often be seen hanging out with Emilio at his restaurant.

A source close to the situation recently dished to People that Katie is beyond 'smitten' with her new love and that she 'keeps texting him all day long and he loves it.'

' He can't get enough of her attention,' the source added.

 DailyMail.com confirmed exclusively on September 10 that Vitolo broke off his previous engagement with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text when handsy photos of him and Holmes were first published.

The handbag designer was left shocked and scrambling and had to move back home.

Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019, and she doesn't seem to have been bothered by his engagement.  

The two first met when a mutual friend introduced them, and their passions have only intensified since she returned home to New York City following time quarantining with her family in Ohio.  

An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.

The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with the playboy actor, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.

Moving on: Katie previously dated Jamie Foxx in 2013, following her 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, but they split in 2019 shortly after going public as a couple; shown in May 2019

The acting couple were first linked in 2013 hand-in-hand through Malibu, but they kept their relationship private throughout the years.

The couple finally split after they took their relationship public last year at the Met Gala.

Prior to coupling up with Foxx, Holmes was married to Hollywood icon Tom Cruise.

The couple began their whirlwind courtship in 2005 and were married in seven weeks.

Katie filed for divorce in 2012, which was finalized after only ten days.

She and Cruise had welcomed their daughter Suri in 2006, who now spends her time with Katie, who has primary custody.
