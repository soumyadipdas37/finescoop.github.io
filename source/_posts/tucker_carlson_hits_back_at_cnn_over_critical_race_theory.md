Fox News host Tucker Carlson has called for his critics including CNN chief Jeff Zucker to 'resign and give their highly-paid gigs to oppressed people'. 

Carlson hit back after CNN's Brian Stelter blamed his show for prompting Donald Trump to announce a crackdown on racial awareness training in the federal government.

Accusing CNN of a campaign to attack his show, the Tucker Carlson Tonight host said that 'as long as Jeff Zucker still holds on to his own job, which according to their own talking points is the ill-gotten fruits of white privilege and systemic racism, we will know for certain that they don't mean a single word of what they are saying'. 

Trump has ordered training on 'critical race theory' to be stripped of funding in the federal government, claiming it was spreading 'divisive, false, and demeaning propaganda'.

Carlson claimed on his show that 'critical race theory' was an 'attempt by the most privileged people in our society - the celebrities, politicians, college professors, talk show hosts - to disclaim the blame for their mismanagement of our country'. 

He continued: 'White privilege is very real, they're telling you, it's time for a reckoning on race relations. 

'You hear that all the time but at some point you've got to wonder why any of these people, the most privileged people in America, still have their jobs. If they meant what they were saying, why haven't they resigned and given their highly-paid gigs to oppressed people? 

'That's a very good question, it's the core question, and someone ought to ask Jeff Zucker about that sometime. 

'Zucker is the head of CNN, he's a graduate of Harvard University, he's been in television his entire adult life. Jeff Zucker is the embodiment of privilege if there ever was one. 

'According to critical race theory, the theory that he espouses and defends, Jeff Zucker got his job precisely because of systemic racism. So why does he still have it? How can he bear to hold that job? Needless to say, Jeff Zucker has no plans to resign. 

'But as long as Jeff Zucker still holds on to his own job, which according to their own talking points is the ill-gotten fruits of white privilege and systemic racism, we will know for certain that they don't mean a single word of what they are saying.'

Carlson also claimed that Zucker had 'ordered his minions' to attack his Fox show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, for questioning critical race theory.

The White House memo published last week stated that 'it has come to the president's attention' that federal agencies were spending money training people on white privilege.   

On Sunday, an article by CNN's Brian Stelter argued that this had 'come to Trump's attention' via Carlson's show. 

The memo cited 'press reports' claiming that federal employees were being pressured into saying they 'benefit from racism'. 

Agencies have now been ordered to 'cease and desist from using taxpayer dollars to fund these divisive, un-American propaganda training sessions'. 

'The divisive, false, and demeaning propaganda of the critical race theory movement is contrary to all we stand for as Americans and should have no place in the Federal government,' the memo added. 



The two-page memo, penned by White House OMB director Russell Vought, was released on Friday 

Trump doubled down on Saturday morning, firing off more than 20 tweets and retweets on the subject - including one calling critical race theory the 'greatest threat to western civilization.'

The order comes as Trump tries to fire up his white, blue-collar base ahead of the November 3 election. 

Polls show him trailing his Democratic challenger Joe Biden both in the national vote and in some key states.  

Trump has spent much of the summer adopting a tough 'law and order' stance and playing down systemic racism in the police. 

He has also railed against the removal of Confederate monuments and vetoed a proposal to renamed military bases which honor Southern generals. 

The race protests flared up again last month after a black man, Jacob Blake, was shot in the back by a white policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 

Last week the US president visited Kenosha, but did not meet with the family of Blake, who has been left paralyzed from the waist down.
