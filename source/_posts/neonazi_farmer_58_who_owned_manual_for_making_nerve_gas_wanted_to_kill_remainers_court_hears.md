A suspected neo-Nazi farmer wanted to 'kill Remainers' with cyanide after being 'frustrated over Brexit,' a court heard.

Russell Wadge, 58, stored the poison in the fridge next to his beer at his country home during a raid by anti-terrorism police, the jury was told.

He was also found with an arsenal of weapons, including grenades and mines, and instructions on how to make nerve gas.

A court heard Wadge allegedly planned to use the chemicals to 'attack Remainers.'

Counter-terrorism police raided his home in the quiet village of Trimsaran, Carmarthenshire, in June last year.

A court heard Russell Wadge, 58, stored poison in the fridge next to his ginger beer at his Carmarthenshire country home which was discovered during a raid by anti-terrorism police

Wadge was also found to have interests in white supremacy and the English Defence League and owned a book titled How Terrorists Kill.

But he claimed he did not have any extremist views and was just a chemicals enthusiast because 'Explosives are fun.'

Newport Crown Court heard Wadge also has a property in Portugal containing chemicals including hydrogen cyanide.

Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the jury Wadge was not 'misunderstood' but was 'dangerous.'

In his closing speech, Mr Little said: 'We say the case against the defendant is clear when you strip away the smoke, the white powder, the phosphorous, and his bluster and fobbing off and attempts to claim he has been misunderstood.

'Force your way through that front door of Baglan Farm and that locked door in the Portugal house that he is trying to keep shut from you and you can seen the reality of the world he frequented.

'The world he frequented wasn't just unusual, weird, and wacky, it was ultimately dangerous and unlawful.'

The court heard Wadge claimed his notes for nerve gas were because he liked a 'challenge' figuring calculations out.

Giving evidence, he said: 'I have an interest in nerve agents - they are toxic which is interesting. Explosives are interesting, because they blow things up. It's interesting.'

Wadge claimed he had not realised that the law changed in 2016 to ban people from owning cyanides.

He said he had his stash for 25 years so 'was not going to use them for a terrorist attack'.

But Mr Little said: 'We say in the course of the months of 2018 and 2019 the defendant was becoming increasingly angry and frustrated with Brexit.

'We have a man who, of all the times, suddenly gets into purchasing chemicals - not just explosives but hydrogen cyanide, which has lethal toxicity - and researching nerve agents.

'Something was going on behind closed doors that he doesn't want you to know about.'

The jury heard internet searches showed significant interest in the white supremacist terror attack in New Zealand in 2019.

When questioned by police, married father Wadge said he did not believe in any extremism and had a 'keen interest' in chemistry.

Defending Paul Hynes QC said Wadge was an 'extraordinary enthusiast'.

He said: 'The prosecution say it's about the B word. That was the best they could do - it's all about Brexit.

'Mr Wadge, having committed no previous criminal offences except for the guilty pleas he entered as a result of the raid on Baglan Farm, all of a sudden because he's frustrated about Brexit suddenly decides to synthesise hydrogen cyanide and is going to attack Remainers and pick them off one by one by squirting them in the face and killing them.'

Officers discovered ingredients to make the 'very dangerous explosive' called triacetone triperoxide TATP - as used in the Manchester Arena bombing.

Boxes of grenades, mines and scale drawings of a KGB weapon to deploy hydrogen cyanide were also discovered.

Wadge allegedly told police: 'If it's dodgy or poison, I love it.'

Wadge denies 28 charges of possessing explosive devices and chemical weapons. 

He admitted five charges of unlawful possession of poisonous chemicals without a licence.

The trial continues.
