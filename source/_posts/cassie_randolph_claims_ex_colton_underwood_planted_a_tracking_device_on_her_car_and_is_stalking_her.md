Cassie Randolph has reportedly filed for a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend Colton Underwood whom she fell for on season 23 of The Bachelor.

In the paperwork, filed by the 25-year-old graduate student in Los Angeles on Friday, she claims the former Bachelor star planted a tracking device on her car and has shown up uninvited at her various residences among other allegations, according to TMZ.  

Randolph also noted their split as mid-April, though they announced the breakup in May 2020, after he gave her the final rose but did not propose on the reality TV's 23rd season, two years prior.

The former contestant claimed Underwood taped a tracking device to the bottom of her car's back bumper to track her whereabouts, which she said he confessed to doing.  

She also filed saying that Underwood, 28, has been showing a pattern of showing up uninvited to her Los Angeles apartment and her parent's Huntington Beach house, where the couple spent part of coronavirus lockdown and recovered from the disease. 

Randolph went on to allege that he takes 'obsessive walks' to her apartment and lingered outside of her bedroom window at her parent's beach house, at 2 A.M., according to the outlet.  

Along with physical behavior, Randolph also claimed that the former football player has been sending her harassing text messages accusing her of spending time with her ex-boyfriend, among other messages.

Since announcing their split earlier this year, Randolph and Underwood have had public dust ups about their relationship and break up. 

Over for months: Randolph cited their split as April 2020 though they announced their split in May, they met on season 23 of The Bachelor, he gave her the final rose but did not propose on the reality TV show two years prior. Seen in April 2019

In July, Randolph accused her ex of trying to 'monetize' their split by writing about it in the upcoming second edition of his book without her prior approval and though they agreed to remain silent on the reasons of the split.  

 'I have gained so much clarity about what I want and more importantly what I need in a relationship,' she wrote at the time. 'I’m so excited for this next chapter of my life with new stories and new people. I can’t thank y’all enough for your understanding and your support during this time.' 

Adding: 'I would like to place on public record & ask you politely to refrain from discussing our relationship, as we agreed... I would also like to ask that you don’t cloud our great, 11/2 year relationship with a messy breakup. ' 

'When our relationship ended we agreed to handle things as privately as possible as we attempted to navigate our new relationship as friends,' Underwood wrote to Instagram after Randolph appeared in a short segment for The Bachelor: Greatest Seasons of All Time. 'I chose to do that since we were living in this interim period, but obviously a lot changed this week.'

Though Underwood later accused The Bachelor franchise of manipulating and taking advantage of Cassie following their breakup.  

Though she declined to divulge much information, Underwood said he was upset to see how Chris and The Bachelor franchise focused solely for their split, it has been claimed.

'Cass stayed extremely professional and extremely quiet about our breakup,' Colton said during an interview with Reality Steve. 'What bugged me was the fact that that show took advantage of her.' 

Split: The former lovebirds first sparked breakup rumors after he returned to his hometown in Colorado after recovering from coronavirus at her family's home in Huntington Beach, California  

In late August the couple unfollowed each other on Instagram. Her family also followed suit. 

Underwood has also been linked to Pretty Little Liars actress Lucy Hale after they were photographed together in July but he quickly said he was a 'single man.'  

While Randolph's older sister, Michelle Randolph, was unfollowed, Underwood still continues to follow Michelle’s boyfriend, Gregg Sulkin, who he reportedly spent time with this summer.

'Its been a crazy few months to say the least, Cass and I have been doing a lot of self-reflecting. Sometimes people are just meant to be friends - and that’s okay,' the former NFL player captioned a black and white snap of them from behind.

He added: 'We both have grown immensely and been through so much together - so this isn’t the end of our story, it’s the start of a whole new chapter for us.' 

The Randolph shared a series of snaps from their relationship with a number of shots with her arms wrapped around Underwood. 

'First off, I want to say this is one of the hardest things I have had to share as neither one of us is quite ready to talk about it yet,' she began in her lengthy post.

'To put it very frank, after the show, we realized we weren't communicating as well as we once did,' he wrote in his memoir The First Time

She continued: 'Colton and I have broken up, but have decided to remain a part of each others lives. With all that we have gone through, we have a special bond that will always be there.' 

'I love Colton very much and have an enormous amount of respect for him. We have both learned and grown so much these past couple years, and will always have each others back. Always,' she concluded.

Their split appeared to be amicable, as the speech pathology student commented two red heart emojis on her ex's post.

In March, the pair previously revealed they split after filming and it was a 'very real and very emotional breakup.'

'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said

Underwood revealed their first breakup and rekindling in his book The First Time.

'To put it very frank, after the show, we realized we weren't communicating as well as we once did,' he wrote.

'Nobody was forcing us to talk about real things going on, so we let a lot of things build up.' 

In the end, 'in a weird way, I kind of broke up with myself,' he added.

The pair mutually decided to have some space to figure things out.

'I was like, I feel like we need to figure this out and in order to do that, we need space. She agreed. So it was a mutual thing,' he elaborated.

The split didn't last long, though - just a few days later, though, the pair were already longing for one another. 

Earlier this year, Colton said he could see them getting engaged by the end of 2020.

'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said.
