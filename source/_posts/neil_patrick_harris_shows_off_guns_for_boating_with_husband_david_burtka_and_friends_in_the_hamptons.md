Neil Patrick Harris has been enjoying some quality family time with his husband and kids in the Hamptons during the summer.

And the five-time Emmy winner is enjoying what's left of the season, as Hollywood continues to bounce back from COVID-19.

He showed off his guns Tuesday in a navy blue tank top, as he went boating with husband David Burtka and friends off the coast of East Hampton.

The 47-year-old complemented the top with grey shorts and a pair of black Birkenstock sandals.

He finished the ensemble with a navy blue Jacks and Jokers baseball cap, a sliver pendant necklace and a black and green printed face mask.

Harris goofed around in a pair of novelty pineapple sunglasses, as Burtka sported his own silly shades, before heading out to sea. 

Burtka, 45, shared a snap to his Instagram Story of their friends Stacey Griffith and Michelle Smith on the boat.
