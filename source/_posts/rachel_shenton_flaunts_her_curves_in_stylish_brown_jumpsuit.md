She is starring in the All Creatures Great And Small reboot coming this September. 

And Rachel Shenton looked stylish as she left the Sunday Brunch studios in London on Sunday where she was no doubt promoting her upcoming role in the drama.

The former Hollyoaks actress, 32, flaunted her curves in a brown belted jumpsuit with flared trousers as she strutted out of the building.

The star made sure to put safety first by donning a quirky zebra print face mask with a see-through section that made her mouth visible.

She accessorised with a big over-the-shoulder Louis Vuitton bag and white trainers for the outing.

She wore her brunette tresses in bouncy waves over her shoulders and opted for dewy natural makeup.

Rachel forms part of the new cast of All Creatures Great And Small - the upcoming Channel 5 series based on the books by Alf Wight which will air later this month.

James Herriot will return to our screens for more veterinary adventures and Rachel will play Herriot's love interest Helen Alderson, reprising Carol Drinkwater and the late Lynda Bellingham's role.

The series stars Nicholas Ralph as James, the role made famous by Christopher Timothy from 1978 to 1990.

Callum Woodhouse from The Durrells plays Tristan Farnon, taking over from Peter Davison, while Samuel West is his irascible older brother Siegfried, originally played by Robert Hardy. 

Viewers will be transported back to the fictional village of Darrowby – and The Drovers Arms pub – although filming took place in Grassington, North Yorkshire, replacing the nearby village of Askrigg used for the original series.  

Last autumn, Rachel took to Instagram to announce her casting in the series, which she was over the moon about.

Alongside a snap of a TV clapper board, she wrote: 'So excited that I can finally say I’m working on ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL for @masterpiecepbs... 

'I’m also excited that I can now freely spam your feed with pictures of various farm animals #dreamjob #imallabouttheanimals #1937 #yorkshire'

All Creatures Great and Small is coming this September to Channel 5.
