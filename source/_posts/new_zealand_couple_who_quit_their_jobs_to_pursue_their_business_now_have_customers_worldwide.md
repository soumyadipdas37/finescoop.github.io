A couple who quit their full-time jobs to dedicate themselves to their Parisian-style jewellery business selling hair clips, earrings and fake eyelashes have made a small fortune and now have returning customers worldwide.

Danicka, 24, and Joseph Thomas, 27, from New Zealand, started the business, Sincerely Danicka, on November 4, 2018 but didn't leave their office jobs until September 1, 2019.

The pair initially started selling second hand furniture but soon realised this product type 'wouldn't scale well' and wanted to try something different, so they asked their customers on social media what they were drawn to most.

'A lot of customers mentioned they wanted pearl hair clips, which were on-trend, but weren't available in New Zealand at the time,' Danicka told FEMAIL.  

After choosing to sell dainty gorgeous jewellery, Danicka and Joseph started developing their small brand further and sourced a manufacturer in Asia before launching on April 26, 2019. 

Within the first five months they made $10,000, followed by an additional $35,000 between September 2019 and March 2020 before being impacted by COVID-19.

Prior to coronavirus, the pair were expecting their sales to double in 2020.

After leaving their jobs, Danicka and Joseph went on a two-month overseas trip to start fresh and seek inspiration before returning back home to their small, start-up business.

While the couple have no previous business experience, they were excited but nervous to put all their time and energy into developing the brand.

Danicka said she has always had an inner desire to start her own business, even though friends and family weren't very supportive.

Sincerely Danicka now offers three different products including affordable hair clips, gorgeous earrings and fake eyelashes that all have a classical and delicate style.

Danicka chooses the products themselves and creates beautiful content to market the jewellery online, while Joseph focuses on the website work and assists with photos and videos. 

While the couple don't design the jewellery themselves, it's a goal they are aiming to achieve in the future as the business grows over time.

As a business, the couple focus on small touches to make the customers feel special through personal thank you notes and stunning presentation

With their business, the couple focus on small touches to make the customers feel special through personal thank you notes and stunning presentation.  

'The brand is quite personal as it has my name in the title - it's as if I'm giving our customers something of mine,' Danicka said. 

'I'm drawn to the pieces we sell too and I want to buy our products for myself. 

'We really try and offer an experience and try to make each customer feel like they're part of the brand.'

'It's all about giving people that one special piece they're looking for that they can hold on to,' Joseph added.

'It has always been about the customers - even from the start when Danicka asked our customers online what they want most instead of furniture.'

Even though family and friends said starting a business would be a 'waste of time', the brand has grown online over the past 12 months and customers from Australia, USA, Canada, UK and across Europe have bought their dainty jewellery

Since launching the brand, the pair agreed the 'most challenging aspect' was understanding how to operate a business and finding a work-life balance.

'The industry is quite secretive due to the competitive nature of businesses and there's not much information on the internet that easily guides you in the right direction,' Danicka said.

The brand now has returning customers from all around the world 

'Figuring out how to get our business out there and marketing our products in a cost-effective way was quite a challenge.'

Even though family and friends said starting a business would be a 'waste of time', the brand has grown online over the past 12 months and returning customers from Australia, USA, Canada, UK and across Europe have bought their dainty jewellery.

Danicka said this may correlate to online platform TikTok, as several of their videos have gone viral and have attracted thousands of new customers.

Unfortunately due to COVID-19, the business has been badly impacted by restrictions and a decrease in sales.  

'I'm drawn to the pieces we sell and all the products I want to buy for myself, which gives the brand more of a personal touch,' Danicka said

When asked what advice they would give to others looking at starting their own business, Danicka said to 'stay true to who you are and learn to enjoy the journey'

When asked what advice they would give to others looking at starting their own business, Danicka said to 'stay true to who you are and learn to enjoy the journey'.

'I would say that it is going to be challenging at times, but challenges are great opportunities to learn from.

'Each business has a different journey to others and to not compare your growth with your competitors.

'I read a quote once that said 'Don't look left or right - keep your head down and work towards your dreams', I often find that when small businesses compare themselves to other businesses, they often rob themselves of growth and originality,' she said.

Customers can view and purchase the range of products on the Sincerely Danicka website.
