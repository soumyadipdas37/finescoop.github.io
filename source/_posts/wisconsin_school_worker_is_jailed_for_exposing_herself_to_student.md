Courtney Roznowski (pictured) was jailed after having sex with a 16-year-old high school student in Green Bay, Wisconsin 

A disgraced school worker who had sex with a 16-year-old high school student was branded the 'nightmare of every parent' by a judge as he jailed her for six months. 

Courtney Roznowski admitted a charge of exposing herself to a minor under a plea deal which saw more serious sexual assault counts dropped. 

The 32-year-old was handed the six-month sentence at a hearing last Friday where she told the Green Bay court that 'I know what I did was wrong', according to Fox11. 

But judge Donald Zuidmulder said he was 'unimpressed' by her pleas for understanding, calling her actions 'appalling'. 

'You are, frankly, the nightmare of every parent. Because what a parent assumes is that their child is in safe environment with trusting people,' the judge said. 

He also told Roznowski to turn around and look at her parents in the public gallery of the Green Bay courtroom. 

'Here’s what I want to tell you, Miss Roznowski: You’ve broken their hearts,' the judge said. 

'And whatever punishment I impose on you, I assume that the humiliation and embarrassment you’ve caused your mother and father is more punishment that you will carry than what I could impose on you.'

The support worker was also placed on probation for three years and ordered to write a letter of apology to Southwest High School staff.  

According to a police report obtained by WBAY, Roznowski admitted having sex with the boy, who said she told him he was 'special and deserved special things'.

Roznowski told investigators she had seen herself as a mentor to the boy before their relationship became sexual.  

According to the police report, the 16-year-old victim told investigators that 'it is every kid's dream to do a teacher'. 

Roznowski said she accepted responsibility and admitted her actions were wrong, but said she had not 'initiated' the relationship. 

She said she had not initially realized that she was exchanging messages with a student at her school, but admitted she should have stopped when she found out.

The school worker also blamed her behavior on a drinking problem which she told the court she had since overcome. 

Roznowski was arrested last year on the more serious charges of sexual assault of a child by a staff member. 

Brown County jail records show she was booked in last August and released on a $10,000 bond.  

She later confessed to investigators when they asked for permission to go through her phone. 

A judge accepted a plea deal earlier this month after state authorities said her contract at the school had ended before the sexual contact took place.
