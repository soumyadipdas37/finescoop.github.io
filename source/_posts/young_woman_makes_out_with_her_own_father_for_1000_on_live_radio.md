A young woman passionately kissed her own father live on breakfast radio on Friday.

The shocking moment happened on Australia's Kyle and Jackie O Show as part of a challenge called Boyfriend or Daddy.

The segment involves a woman coming into the studio with a male companion, then hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson have to guess whether it's her boyfriend or her father.

Pass the bucket! This is the horrifying moment a woman, 26, makes out with her own father, 49, live on breakfast radio - leaving the hosts completely shocked 

If the 'couple' are able to trick the hosts, they take home a $1,000 prize.

Explaining the segment, Jackie said that she and Kyle make their judgements based on 'body language and how uncomfortable [they] might be with certain questions'.

It's usually fairly easy for them to tell whether the pair are lovers or related, but Friday's guests went the extra mile to convince they were dating.

They shared a quick kiss as they entered the radio studio, but Jackie said this didn't mean anything because her father also gives her a peck on the lips occasionally.

The Kyle and Jackie O Show's newsreader, Brooklyn Ross, also noted that the pair had been holding hands  minutes earlier outside in the green room. 

The older man introduced himself as 49-year-old named Nick, and the woman said she was a 26-year-old named Stacy.

The radio hosts asked the 'couple' what their favourite sexual position was. Despite the uncomfortable nature of the question, they didn't miss a beat.

'I like underneath, absolutely' said Nick, as Stacy nodded in agreement.

The sexually charged questions continued, as Kyle asked Nick if he enjoyed oral sex with his 'younger girlfriend'.

Stacy said she 'taught him a lot' about the subject, prompting Kyle to say: 'Okay, this is going to be really weird if it ends up being the father.'

Kyle hastened to add: 'But her job is try and win the money - don't forget. So you can't believe anything she says.'

As they reached the end of the segment, Jackie said she was torn and couldn't tell if the pair were a couple or father and daughter.

She added that she was slightly in favour of them being related because of their family resemblance.

'There's only one way to decide this,' Jackie said. 'Would you guys be willing to give each other just a little kiss on the lips?

'Because if it's your dad, I wouldn't want to be encouraging a pash or anything...'

'Oh, I don't mind!' interrupted Kyle, prompting the guests to share a lingering kiss live on air.

'They are fully kissing! It's a make out,' said Kyle in disbelief, before Brooklyn added: 'It has to be a boyfriend after seeing that... I'm disturbed.'

'It has to be the boyfriend,' said Jackie.

'It can't be the father. No one kisses their father like that... unless you live in the mountains and don't have any neighbours,' Kyle replied. 

But it turns out Kyle, Jackie and Brooklyn were wrong.

'The things we do for money. This is actually my father!' Stacy revealed, as the entire studio burst into horrified laughter.

'My boyfriend's going to be mortified!'

The hosts were shell-shocked, with Jackie yelling: 'No! That didn't just happen!'

In-studio footage of the father and daughter kissing was broadcast on The Kyle and Jackie O Show's Instagram account, but has since been deleted.
