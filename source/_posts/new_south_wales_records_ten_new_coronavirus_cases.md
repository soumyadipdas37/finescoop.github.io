There have been 10 new cases of COVID-19 in New South Wales, with one of them a young child who has no known links to another positive case.

Of the new cases four were returned travellers in hotel quarantine, four are linked to known clusters and two - including the child - are being investigated.

There have now been 3,925 cases of COVID-19 in the state since the outbreak began.

The state recorded more than 38,000 tests, but 18,000 of those were carried out in August and early September but not previously reported.

Sunday's numbers are double theÂ amount of cases from a day earlier.
