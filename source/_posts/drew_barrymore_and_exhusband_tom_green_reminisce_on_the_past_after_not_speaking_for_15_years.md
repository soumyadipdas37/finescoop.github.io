They were just a couple of young kids in love when they were married in 2001.

And Drew Barrymore was delighted to reminisce with her ex-husband Tom Green during a sit-down on her new self-titled show.

The 45-year-old actress took a walk down memory lane with her former beau after admitting it had been nearly 20 years since their divorce, and '15 years' since they last spoke to each other.

Drew recalled a happy time where she understood 'what safety and contentedness feels before you’re going to sleep' at Tom's family lake house.

'You know when you say 20 years, it’s sometimes it’s the blink of an eye, and sometimes you’re like, "Oh my God, we’ve lived so much in these last twenty years." You’ve had a whole life and I’ve had a whole life,' she said. 

'It’s just really nice to come together and check-in and talk about it, it just thrills me to no end. I think the world of you and I celebrate you and I always have and I always will.'

Tom and Drew were married on July 7, 2001 after a whirlwind romance. They filed for divorce in December 2001 citing irreconcilable differences. 

'It’s been too long, it’s nice to reconnect,' Tom said. 'We really did not talk for about 15 years I guess and this is really the first time we’ve looked at each other face-to-face in 15 years.'

Drew remembered how the former couple first met in 2000 when she was filming and producing Charlie's Angels.  

'One of the things that means so much to me professionally also is because one of the reasons we got to know each other in the first place was I admired your work so much and so I reached out to you and asked you to come and do Charlie’s Angels and you so graciously said yes,' she said.

The Freddy Got Fingered star recalled that the pair 'hit it off right away pretty much'  with their shared love of having a good time.  

'We had a lot of laughs together,' he said. 'I think one of our first dates, I think we went and bought lobsters because we both love animals and we both got lobsters and we released them into the ocean. That was what we decided to do.'

Drew remembered that Tom was the catalyst in her love of photography. 

'You bought me a camera and I still have it the Pentax K1000 and you got me started into what would become two decades full of being a real photographer and you got me into my whole Annie Hall phase of taking photographs which is such a beautiful art,' she said.

'One of the things that means so much to me professionally also is because one of the reasons we got to know each other in the first place was I admired your work so much and so I reached out to you and asked you to come and do Charlie’s Angels and you so graciously said yes,' she said.

'I found this mug in my garage a couple of years ago and I just kind of kept it because I figured someday I might be on your TV show and it’d be fun to have a sip out of your mug,' Tom said.

 Not one to forget a priceless collectible, Tom whipped out a personalized mug with a picture of Drew in a neck brace.

'I found this mug in my garage a couple of years ago and I just kind of kept it because I figured someday I might be on your TV show and it’d be fun to have a sip out of your mug,' Tom said. 

'Remember the day in NY, you were doing yoga, you sprained your neck and then Chris went and made these mugs and somehow I kept the mug all these years. I kept the mug.'

Drew admitted she was 'so happy' too see Tom again after all of these years.  

'Yeah we had a lot of amazing experiences and I am grateful for that and I cherish them. Thanks Drew I appreciate it,' he said.
