Former Bachelor star Rachael Arahill makes no secret of her fondness for Botox.

But 25-year-old personal trainer is less forthcoming about her habit of airbrushing herself beyond all recognition on Instagram.

Rachael looked like an anime character as she showed off her miraculously smooth complexion in a photo shared with her 14,000 followers on Monday.

Her face was stripped back to only its most basic features, giving her an oddly alien-like look as she posed for the camera. 

There were no signs of any poures, or face lines whatsoever, and she appeared to have broken the golden rule of Photoshopping: keep it subtle. 

'One week I post every second day, the next not at all. I like to keep you all on your toes,' she teased underneath the photo.

Rachael has completely transformed her appearance - so much so that fans may struggle to recognise her today.

She recently traded in her voluminous blonde locks and plumped-up lips for a classy, understated look.

The reality star sports a chic bob hairstyle these days, and has also laid off the dermal filler - resulting in an overall more natural appearance.

During her time on the Channel 10 dating program, she was continuously ridiculed her for her botox appearance.

According to one of Rachael's friends, the blonde bombshell forked out almost $10,000 on lip fillers and Botox before filming.

Rachael chopped off her long hair in early March, and her fans were instantly delighted with the results.
