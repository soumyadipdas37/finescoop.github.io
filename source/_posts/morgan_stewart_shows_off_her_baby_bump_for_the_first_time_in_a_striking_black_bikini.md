She's a proud mother-to-be!

Morgan Stewart took to her Instagram on Saturday, September 5, to show off her growing baby bump for the first time since she and fiance Jordan McGraw announced they were expecting their first child together in August.

For her post, the Nightly Pop host shared a couple of photos of herself posing confidently in a striking black bikini.

'Can we get this emoji a bikini please....' she teased in the caption, before adding the pregnant mother emoji.

In one photo, she crossed her left leg over her right and seductively lifted her left arm up to the back of her head while standing in front of a window with the lush green yard in the background.

Stewart, who starred in the reality show Rich Kids Of Beverly Hills, wore her blonde tresses long and stringy with a part in the middle, and accessorized with gold jewelry pieces and large sunglasses.  

She also shared a mirror selfie on her Insta-Story that showed her smiling for the camera and cradling her bump.

Nearly a month ago, Stewart and fiance Jordan McGraw, who's the son of famed television host Dr. Phil, announced that they're expecting a baby girl. 

During their gender reveal video, the couple looked overjoyed when they pierced a balloon that revealed a flurry of baby pink confetti.  

'She may not be great at math but at least we know she’ll be well dressed,' Stewart captioned her post, while her musician fiance wrote, 'Been working on my dad jokes for years' along with his post.

Back on the Fourth of July, the couple announced they were engaged by posting a photo of Stewart wearing a one-piece swimsuit with the massive diamond ring on her finger with the caption, 'Fireworks.' 

It was first revealed back in March 2020 that the pair had started dating.

Their union was disclosed five months after Stewart filed for divorce from husband Brendan Fitzpatrick back in October 2019 after three years of marriage.
