Former Married At First Sight star Cathy Evans left little to the imagination in a series of racy selfies.

Posting to Instagram on Tuesday, the 26-year-old flaunted her ample assets as she spruiked a lingerie company.  

Cathy looked glam in a black lacy bra and an unbuttoned white shirt that was seductively falling off her shoulder.

In the images, Cathy wore her blonde locks loose in beachy waves and a full face of makeup, including a smokey eye bold brows and nude lips.

The racy post comes after she debuted her new boyfriend, Richard, in a loved-up Instagram post last week.

The blonde stunner posted an illustration of the couple created by T & D Collective, and explained in the caption that she won't be sharing many photos of Richard because he's a very private person.

'It's a special day today. My boyfriend's birthday, and I don't share him on Insta purely because I like to keep my love life private,' she told her 181,000 followers.

'People wanna ruin a good thing and I don't want that for us,' she added. 

'Plus he's a private man and I respect his wishes. But for once, I'll post of us. I love you so much.'

Richard's face can't be made out in the drawing, presumably because he wants to keep his identity a secret, but he appears to have a beard and a sleeve tattoo.   

The reality star met police officer Richard shortly after filming Nine's social experiment, but this marks the first time she has shared a photo of him on Instagram.

Cathy was married to Josh Pihlak on the reality series, but the couple ended their relationship during the season after she clashed with his mother.
