West Ham manager David Moyes is adamant that his side should have been awarded a penalty against Arsenal.

The Hammers ended up with nothing to show for their efforts at Emirates Stadium, with Eddie Nketiah scoring a late winner for the Gunners, who prevailed 2-1.

Moyes felt that Arsenal defender Gabriel should have been penalised after appearing to handle Tomas Soucek's header.

Speaking after the game, Moyes told Sky Sports: 'Yeah I think we should have had a penalty. They're saying something to do with his sleeve, it hits the boy's arm. Even with the old rules we'd still be saying it's a penalty but we don't know the rules really.'

West Ham fell behind to a goal from Alexandre Lacazette but managed to pull level when Michail Antonio scored just before half time.

West Ham fared considerably better than they did against Newcastle last time out, and Moyes felt that his side certainly deserved to at least take a point from proceedings.

He said: 'It is a tough result. The players did really well, to not to be rewarded with some points is hard on us.' 

'We switched off when we shouldn't of but made good chances but couldn't take them.'

Earlier in the game West Ham had another penalty appeal turned down, with Gabriel bringing down Jarrod Bowen.  

Moyes was frustrated that his side weren't able to remain fully focused for the entirety of the game, and lamented the lapse in concentration which was punished by Nketiah.

Moyes said: 'Some weeks you won't play well, hopefully since I've come in we've been a good team. We want to get better and not accept losing. 

'We turned off in the last minute, some of the boys did an unbelievable job to put us in that position, but turning off in the last few minutes is criminal.'

West Ham are back in action on Tuesday when they host Hull in the Carabao Cup before taking on Wolves in the Premier League five days later.
