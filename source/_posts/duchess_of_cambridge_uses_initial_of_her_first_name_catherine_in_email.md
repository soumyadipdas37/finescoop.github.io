Kate Middleton has used the initial of her first name Catherine to sign off an email to judges of her Hold Still portrait contest.

Taking to Kensington Royal Twitter account, Kate, 38, shared an email teasing the final 100 photographs picked to feature in the Hold Still exhibition - a campaign she spearheaded which aims to capture a snapshot of the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.  

Alongside the caption: 'An email was sent yesterday...Eyes#HoldStill2020,' the contents of the email read: 'Dear judges, I am thrilled we have chosen the final 100 portraits. I thought you might like to see the images all together so please find them attached.

I couldn't have done it without you so thank you so much for your help. C.' 

The Duchess of Cambridge has added a personal touch to her email by signing off with the letter 'C.' Pictured, during a visit to The Nook in Framlingham Earl, Norfolk, which is one of the three East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH) on June 25, 2020 in Framlingham Earl 

The royal penned: 'I couldn't have done it without you so thank you so much for your help. C' (pictured)

It comes just weeks after Prince William made the same informal move and signed off with 'W.'

At the end of June, the father-of-three expressed his joy at football returning in the UK amid Covid-19. 

Taking to the Kensington Palace Twitter account, Prince William penned: 'So good to have football back, we have all missed it! Thank you to everyone involved for your hard work in making it happen. W.'

'Don't know why, but the initial 'W' looks and sounds very regal and King-like!' enthused one royal fan, while a second penned: 'We would like a picture of William in front of the TV with his AV shirt on as his birthday picture please. Thanks.'

As expected, The Duchess of Cambridge was immaculately clad for her latest royal engagement. 

If you’re wondering why Kate’s dress looks familiar, it’s because she wore it to last year’s Wimbledon tournament.

Hailing from Suzannah, this elegant midi is crafted from silk crepe with a timeless fit-and-flare silhouette, accentuated by a waist belt and contrasting buttons. It's no surprise the Duchess chose to wear it again!

While Kate elevated her ensemble with Tabitha Simmons heels, this design would work equally well with flats on a more casual occasion. Fancy trying it out? Click (right) to place your order.

In June, the Duke of Cambridge took to the Kensington Palace official Twitter account and penned: 'So good to have football back, we have all missed it! Thank you to everyone involved for your hard work in making it happen. W' (pictured)

In May, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge changed the display names on their Instagram and Twitter accounts.

While the social media display names for the @Kensingtonroyal handle used to be Kensington Palace, Prince William and Kate Middleton changed them to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

And fans from across the globe took to social media to praise the decision - with many adding it feels more 'personal' and 'appropriate.'

'I got used to 'Kensington Palace,' but the new name is probably more appropriate,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'I feel it a little bit more personal.'

A third added: 'They've really been doing phenomenal on social media!!' while a further wrote: 'I like that - comes across as more personal!'

The Kensington Royal Twitter account was created in September 2014 and initially represented Prince William, Kate and Prince Harry.

They launched their shared Instagram account a year later - with the first post published being an engagement carried out by Prince Harry.

But following Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding in May 2018, the then-newly weds launched their own @sussexroyal Instagram account - which is now inactive - but they opted for the display name 'The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.'
