The former Made In Chelsea star, 30, took to Instagram to upload images of herself posing up a storm in an orange bikini.

Lucy was catapulted into the spotlight after appearing on Made In Chelsea from 2012 till 2016, and has since turned her attention to the world of veganism.

The TV star - who has been dating James for five years - previously treated fans to tips on maintaining a long-lasting romance, telling MailOnline: 'You have to choose the person that you’re with. 

'You can fall into loads of relationships with people you just end up with, but you have to look at whether their personality and goals match up to yours.

'I think a lot of people just end up falling into things, and it doesn’t work out as there wasn’t a lot of thought process that went into it.'

On not feeling pressured to get married or have kids, Lucy went on: 'I don’t know when, but I know James will probably be the person I end up with, unless something drastic happens. 

'I’m settled now for the foreseeable. Unlike my friends, I don’t have any set goals for marriage and kids. They put a lot of pressure on themselves to reach those goals, but I don’t. When it feels right for both us, then we will, but we’ll have to see.'
