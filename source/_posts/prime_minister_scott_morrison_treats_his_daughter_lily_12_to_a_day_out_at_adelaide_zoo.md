Prime Minister Scott Morrison has treated his youngest daughter to a trip to the zoo as she joined him on a visit to Adelaide.

Mr Morrison and his daughter Lily, 12, arrived at Adelaide Zoo on Saturday and were shown around by zookeepers, even getting to cuddle some furry animals. 

The adorable Quokkas appeared to be Lily's favourite as she smiled widely while holding onto the tiny wallaby.

The prime minister was not shy either but looked a bit worried as he held a quokka while his daughter and zoo keepers watched on. 

Following their cuddling with the animals, the pair took a tour around the zoo and stopped to chat with other families. 

His visit comes after South Australia reopened its borders to New South Wales on Friday following low COVID-19 cases and community transmission. 

He said Sydneysiders would be right behind him and head to South Australia providing a massive $800million boost to the economy.

Mr Morrison stressed once again that when other states reopen their borders or not they should explain to the people why. 

'All I've simply asked is when states make those decisions that they do it efficiently, that they explain the reasons and they seek to administer it in a way that is done fairly,' he said.

'They are judgments that at the more micro level the states will make and so I leave them to make them.'

The trip also saw Mr Morrison visit the newly constructed shipyard for the navy's fleet of frigates, and speak at the SA Liberal Party's annual meeting.

Back in July, Mr Morrison was slammed for taking a break to spend time with his family but was instead spotted at an NRL game. 

'I will not be joining them for that full-time. I will also not be standing aside from the tasks I have all day,' he said on Friday. 

Australians vented their frustration as Mr Morrison's break came at the same time as COVID-19 cases were surging again in Victoria.

Others however said the prime minister deserved some time off for all the work he had put in.
