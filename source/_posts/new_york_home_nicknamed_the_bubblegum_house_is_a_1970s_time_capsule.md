For sale: four bedroom home, 1970s decor, MUST like pink!

A home on New York's Staten Island has just hit the market having had just one previous set of homeowners who lived in the house from the moment it was built.

Nicknamed 'The Bubblegum house', the dwelling is unique due to the fact that virtually every single room and furnishing is decorated in shades of pink.

From the carpet to the staircase and from the draws to the doors, there's almost no surface that he been left free from a pinkish hue.

The four-bed, three-bath home in Staten Island’s Grasmere neighborhood is drenched in pastel hues - and is mainly pink!

The house, which was built in 1970, appear to belong to another era but it has been so well preserved it's in perfect condition

The four bedroom, three bathroom house was built for Barbara DeLeo and her husband, Richard, who both moved into the property in 1969.

Barbara, now 83, ran a local Deli while Richard, who has since passed away, was an engineer for Verizon. 

After suffering a stroke two years ago, Barbara finally decided that after making a lifetime of memories at the home, it was time to downsize and it is now on the market for $829,000.

'Everyone calls it the bubblegum house,' DeLeo said to the New York Post.

A large upstairs bathroom has mirrored walls and a sunken bathtub which was specially designed for the home 

However, she reveals, originally the home wasn't quite as pink. 'When I first built the house, the central staircase was brown — and then I said, "That's gotta go", 'I love pink.' 

And so it began. The pink shades began appearing all of over the home from a bath and tiles along with wall coverings and window trim. 

An upstairs living room that once had blue carpeting was covered in a soft baby pink color.

The sunken living room area leads to a pink-carpeted dining room with a kitchen nearby, while a pink hallway leads to three of the four bedrooms with the same soft pink carpet running throughout. 

Downstairs, pink steps lead up from a pink walled basement where a pink bar sits among pink carpeting.

The home is at 820 W. Fingerboard Road in Staten Isladn, a few minutes west of the ramp to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge

The home has been owned by Barbara and Richard DeLeo since it was built for them in 1969

Set on a 4,312-square-foot lot, the home also has a spacious backyard area and a large patio

From the outside, the home is completely unassuming and built from brown bricks but once inside, the decor which is distinctly 1970s, will make any new owners feel as though they are walking into a living time capsule.

Despite its age, the home has been lovingly cared for. At one point several generations of the DeLeo family lived there, together with the couple's children, Barbara Lynn and Anthony who are now in their 60s. Their grandparents and an aunt lived downstairs. It also explains where a kitchen was built on each floor. 

DeLeo said the decision to finally sell has not been an easy one. 'I was heartbroken, really,' she said to the Post.  

'My brother and I both cried when we told the real-estate agent to take it,' her daughter Barbara said as she recalled the home having 'a lot of happy memories. A lot of parties went on in that house.'

'It was bright and cheery. I don't think all the men loved it too much, but my father never complained,' she said.

The family are hoping that whoever snaps up the place will care for it in the same loving manner it has been up to now. 

'God was good to me, and I took care of it, because I loved it,' DeLeo said. 

The main kitchen is pink-free thanks to its blue-grey fixtures and floor tiles
