Irish backpacker Katie Murtagh was enjoying a dream trip around the world before it ended with her being charged over a Sydney stabbing that left a man with a partially severed ear.  

Murtagh's social media pages paint a glamorous life of festivals, trips to Asia and beach days. 

But the 26-year-old's adventure was dramatically cut short when she and boyfriend Patrick Earle, 23, were charged over the brutal attack on Oliver Solan, 30, in a unit on Young Street at Randwick, in Sydney's east on Saturday night. 

Police allege Earle and four other men set upon Solan as he lay motionless on the floor of the apartment, using a knife to sever part of his ear and leaving him with a ruptured spleen. 

Officers claim Murtagh allegedly sent a Facebook message to Earle's friends asking them to come over, at which point she let them in to the unit and hid in her room as they attacked Solan with a knife.

Neighbours found victim Oliver Solan, 30, barely conscious in a hallway at a Young Street apartment block in Randwick, in Sydney's east, about 8.40pm on Sunday

Before her arrest Murtagh had lived a glamorous life travelling across Asia after leaving her home in Dublin in 2017.

Photos show the Irish woman's travels through Thailand, soaking in the sun in Phuket and lounging on a boat in the pristine waters of Ban Thai in Krabi.

Murtagh is seen alongside friends at beach parties in Kathu and swimming in the clear beaches on Koh Phi Phi.

She is also pictured at full moon parties with groups of fellow Irish nationals and riding elephants through the Asian jungle.

When Murtagh finished her travels in she settled in her new home in Sydney and moved into the Young Street unit block with Earle, from Kilkenny in Ireland. It was there the attack took place. 

Daily Mail Australia revealed on Monday Earle, Murtagh and Solan had been drinking together at an eastern suburbs pub before returning to the couple's apartment on Saturday night. 

While there an argument between the two men ensued.

Solan was allegedly the first to attack his friend, causing injuries to Earle's arm.

It was then that Murtagh allegedly sent a Facebook message to Earle's friends asking them to come over, at which point she let them in to the unit and hid in her room as they attacked Solan with a knife, severing part of an ear.  

The glamorous Irish couple were arrested shortly after while four other men went on the run.

NSW Police said the men they wish to speak to are all originally from Ireland. 

A 34-year-old man was charged late Monday night with wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

He handed himself in at Maroubra Police Station after NSW Police released pictures of four men in the hopes they could assist with the investigation.

The Waterloo man is believed to be involved in the altercation at the unit and was granted strict bail to appear at Waverley Local Court on September 23. 

 

Earle, from Kilkenny, and Murtagh both faced Waverley Local Court on Monday where they were refused bail.

Appearing in court via video link, Earle sat quietly wearing a hospital gown and with a bandage over his left ear.

He was taken into custody from Prince of Wales Hospital where he was treated for an injury to his arm on Saturday night.

The court was told he is facing a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted, with a standard non-parole period of seven years.

Murtagh chose not to appear on screen in court and along with her boyfriend will be held in custody until October 27.

During that time the lovers turned co-accused will not be able to talk.

Police allege that Murtagh was aware of what would happen when she invited and let her boyfriend's backup inside their apartment.

When her boyfriend and the four men fled, CCTV footage allegedly shows her using her strength to drag Solan's bloodied body into the hall.
