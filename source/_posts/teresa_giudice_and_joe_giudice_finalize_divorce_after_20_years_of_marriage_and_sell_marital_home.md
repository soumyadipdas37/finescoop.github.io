The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice has finalized her divorce from high school sweetheart Joe Giudice after a nine-month legal separation and 20 years of marriage.

'I am so proud of Joe and Teresa for working together and resolving all of their matrimonial issues through the mediation process,' attorney Vikki Ziegler told People on Wednesday.

'Despite the pandemic and difficulty of Joe residing in Italy full time, with the use of technology, the couple was able to work together for the best interests of their children to come to terms on all open topics relative to their marriage. Mediation saved them time and additional money fighting a battle in Court that could have taken years to resolve.'

The amicable exes - both 48 - share four daughters: Gia, 19; Gabriella, 15; Milania, 14; and Audriana, who turns 11 on September 14.

'Joe and Teresa are in an amazing place and are very supportive of one another,' a source told the mag.

'They still have love for each other, they just aren't in love with each other.' 

The Giudices reportedly hope to reunite when Joe competes against Jennifer Lopez's ex-husband #1 Ojani Noa at a Celebrity Boxing match scheduled for October 24 in the Bahamas, according to Hollywood Life.

The Saronno-born amateur boxer was deported back to his native Italy last October after completing his three-year sentence at Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution.

Teresa - formerly known as FCI Danbury inmate No. 65703-050 - completed her own 11-month sentence for 41 counts of fraud in December 2017.

The tax-evading pair were originally sentenced in October 2014 for bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.

News of the Giudices' divorce came the same day Page Six reported that they're putting their marital Montville mansion on the market this Thursday for $2.5M.
