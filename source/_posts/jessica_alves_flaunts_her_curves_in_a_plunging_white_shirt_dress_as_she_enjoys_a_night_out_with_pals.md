She recently had her 12th nose job, using cartilage from her ear.

And Jessica Alves proved she had bounced back after the surgery as she put on a sizzling display while enjoying a night at Novikov in London on Saturday. 

The Brazilian reality star, 37, looked sensational as she flaunted her curves in a white shirt dress with a plunging front to accentuate her assets.

Wow! Jessica Alves looked sensational as she flaunted her curves in a plunging shirt dress while enjoying a night out at Novikov in London on Saturday

Jessica ensured all eyes were on her by donning a black corset -style belt around her trim midriff. 

Adding some height to her frame, the blonde donned a pair of thigh-high black latex stockings which were attached to some bejewelled heels.

The media sensation added a pop of colour to her stylish look by adding a slick of red lipstick as well as a touch of blusher to accentuate her features. 

As she was leaving the restaurant Jessica toted a quilted black leather handbag and stopped to embrace some pals.

Jessica's night on the town comes after she explained to MailOnline that her long hair is the 'ultimate symbol of femininity.' 

Speaking about her hair transformation at Krystalized Hair Salon in Loughton, Jessica said: 'Every 6 weeks I have to do the maintenance of my hair extensions.

'I find very therapeutic going to beauty Salons, I get to meet other ladies and exchange beauty tips and also to listen to their relationship dramas it is always fun.'

Off she goes: She appeared to be in good spirits after the night out

However, Jessica admitted that her flowing locks means more to her than just how she looks aesthetically.

The blonde, who transitioned into a woman earlier this year, added to MailOnline: 'To me the long hair is the ultimate symbol of femininity.

'Day by day I see changes on my body and skin became more and more feminine my body now matches my soul and my mind.'

Jessica, who is set to head Holland next week to film her new TV show, also revealed last week that she had her twelfth nose job, which she told MailOnline she didn't know she was set to have.

The reality personality shared a glimpse of her new nose via Instagram following the cosmetic procedure after visiting the Prof. Dr. Ali Gürlek in Istanbul, Turkey, on Wednesday, before she was seen leaving the city's W hotel the following day.

Jessica explained to MailOnline: 'Throughout the years I have had a lot of problems, I have had a lot of nose jobs done in Brazil, Colombia, Iran, America and here in Istanbul with great success.   

All in the details: She toted a quilted black handbag and added a stylish ring

'On the downside I've had infections with cartilage, but what caused problems was when they use cartilage from a donor and that's when my drama started a few years ago.

'My latest nose job was in January last year in Iran, the doctor cleared all my nose, removed all the cartilage and left it without any cartilage at all. That's why it was so shrunk.

'Now Dr. Ali Gürlek in Istanbul used cartilage from my ear and I can breathe much better now.'
