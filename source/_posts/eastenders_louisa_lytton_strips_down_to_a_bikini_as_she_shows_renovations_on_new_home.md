Louisa took to social media to share a snap of herself and husband-to-be Ben sat in the back of the moving lorry surrounded by boxes.

The star admitted the chance to buy their first home was a welcome consolation after the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to cancel their wedding.

She penned the caption: 'Still unpacking i honestly don't know how all of that stuff fit in our little flat. 

'I feel so overwhelmed (in a good way) my flat was my baby, it looked after us during lockdown, it allowed me and the girls (@alexlouizebird @mariannaneo ) to fall in drunk after nights out, have nights in with 3BlindMice (@cartierfraseriheacho @mafromusic) it even had a space in the bed for @natashastonemua for a whole month whilst she held my hand and supplied lots of wine through a break up.

The Ruby Allen actress later took to her Stories to document the early stages of transforming her home, including making friends with the new neighbourhood cat, and helping her nearby mother paint her fence.

Louisa was forced to postpone her wedding in the US earlier this year due to the coronavirus crisis.

But her spirits were recently lifted after her friends threw her a surprise hen do in the park on the day they should have been flying out to Croatia together.

The actress revealed that she was tricked into believing she was going to Ikea with her fiancé, before actually being surprised with a picnic.

She captioned the snaps: 'Today we would have been jetting off for my hen do, instead I went to work, came home and argued with Ben as to why I didn't want to 'go to IKEA in 30 degree heat'.

'Little did I know it was all a ploy to get me to my surprise pre hen picnic. What a special day, social distance celebrations are fast becoming my fave. A picnic with my girls in the sun. All that was needed x love you all x Thank you.'

Louisa is yet to reveal when he wedding, which should have been taking place in August, has been rescheduled for. 

Louisa and Ben got engaged on her 30th birthday while on holidays in the Maldives last year, just a year after being together.
