She and Kim Kardashian have reportedly 'drifted apart,' which was further confirmed after they unfollowed each other on Instagram.

But on Wednesday night, Larsa Pippen didn't appear in the least bit fazed as she stepped out for dinner at celeb hot spot Madeo in Bevlery Hills.

The 46-year-old star made a statement in a zebra printed jumpsuit for her evening out in Los Angeles.

Larsa - who opted to forgo a face mask - donned the baggy, silky zebra printed number, which featured a fabric belt and zipper down the middle.

She rocked clear heels with white polish and her fingers and toes.

The star rounded out her look with a small black Hermes handbag with gold hardware; her hair was half up, half down and she had a full face of makeup.

In May of this year, Larsa slammed trolls after they criticized her caption that seemingly alluded to her estranged husband, basketball legend Scottie Pippen.

The duo are parents to four children together: sons Scotty Jr, Preston, and Justin, and daughter Sophia.

The criticism started after she posted a snap of herself and captioned it: 'Find someone who'll put you first.'

People commented things like 'To [sic] bad you didn't put Scottie pippen first' and 'that's what scottie did,' according to People.

Larsa replied back to the critics, writing: 'Really? I did everything for him literally everything' as well as 'How do you know that?'

When one troll mentioned the rumor that she committed 'adultery first' she wrote a scathing response back: 'Stop tripping dude u don't know what you're talking about. I held him down and still do. Just bc I don't air his dirty laundry doesn't mean it doesn't stink I just don't wanna do his laundry anymore.'

Her clapback came nearly a month after she defended him on Twitter after the Michael Jordan docuseries The Last Dance talked about Scottie's earnings with the Chicago Bulls, revealing it was much less than Jordan's.

'Thx for your concern Scottie did ok #TheLastDance,' adding a screengrab of an article about it.

He made $109,102,430 during his NBA career, People reported. 

Larsa and Scottie wed in 1997 but split in October 2016; Scottie filed for divorce from her just two days after two voice recordings were released with Larsa alleging that he was verbally aggressive to her in a call to the police.

Cops made two visits in early October 2016  for domestic disturbances but no further details were ever known.

He asked the divorce to be dismissed in November 2017, suggesting they reconciled - with the duo hitting the carpet together in February 2018.

However, in November 2018 Larsa filed for divorce after 21 years of marriage, after allegedly cheating on him, an allegation she later shut down on Twitter in since-deleted tweets.

Five days ago, Larsa shared a snap of herself with Scottie and three of their children in celebration of their son Preston's birthday - her and Scottie's current relationship status is not known.

Larsa and Kim Kardashian have reportedly unfollowed each other on social media, with Kourtney and Khloe also not following Larsa as well.

Soon after, Larsa unfollowed Kim's sisters.

'The friendship just naturally grew apart over a period of time because life happens. Kim is focused on matters at home - getting Kanye West healthy, her four young kids, law school and juggling her businesses,' E! News' source said.

'They are in a different place in their lives and are not as close as they used to be, but have no ill feelings at all and still stay in touch,' the insider added.
