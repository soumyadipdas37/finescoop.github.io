The Bachelorette, starring sisters Elly and Becky Miles, is set to premiere on Wednesday, October 7.

And on Thursday, Channel 10 released an extended trailer for the brand new series - and it looks like it's going to be one of the wildest seasons to date.

The new promo teases a cringeworthy strip show courtesy of one of the contestants, at least fifteen steamy kisses, and a particularly savage break-up.

Wild! An extended trailer for The Bachelorette shows Becky Miles (centre) getting a lap dance from a potential suitor, while her sister Elly Miles (right) watches on in disbelief

'Can't wait to see these guys with their shirts off!' Elly, 25, says within the first 20 seconds of the trailer, as it's revealed the sisters are about to watch a strip tease in order to get closer to the lads.

The promo then cuts to a suitor gyrating on Becky, 30, completely shirtless, as the flustered blonde tells the camera: 'Shannon could do that anytime!'

The teaser also reveals some of the high-octane single dates, including skydiving, sailing on a private yacht, and walking across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

But despite these high points, host Osher Günsberg makes the sinister promise that it won't be an easy ride for the siblings.

'I think it's time for you to leave': Becky (right) is also seen furiously telling a mystery man to get out of the mansion before a rose ceremony

Devastated: Elly is shown storming out of the mansion in tears during the two-minute clip 

'If I've got to push people out the way to get what I want, sorry, but I'm going to do that,' one suitor says, before another warns Becky of the 'shallow and disrespectful' comments one of his rivals is making about her behind her back.

'I think it's time for you to leave,' Becky then furiously tells a mystery man, before the camera cuts to Elly in tears in the mansion's garden.

However, in true Bachelorette style, there's an abundance of passion to be had - and the women are seen sharing raunchy kisses with a range of suitors.

'I'm falling in love with you,' one of the men is heard saying, as the jaw-dropping trailer comes to an end. 

Emotional moment: Elly bursts into tears multiple times during the trailer, as she finds it hard to ascertain who is genuine and who is just looking for fame

Saucy! Elly is even shown hooking up with a suitor in a hot tub

It appears the show has been a positive experience for the sisters.

On Thursday, Elly told Who magazine they had both found and were still with their respective winners.

'Yes we have [both found love]. I'm so happy right now for myself and for Bec. Her guy is the best, I love him - for her,' she said.

Elly added that she'd hoped her sister would find someone on the show after going though 'a lot of hardship' in past relationships.

Hot and heavy! The trailer features at least 15 kisses, as it's clear the sisters didn't hesitate to try the merchandise before making their decisions

Becky also told the publication that Elly had allowed herself to be more vulnerable this season, and was glad it had paid off for her.

When asked if they'd ever fought over the same guy in the mansion, Elly gave one major reason why that was never going to be on the cards.

'There was no chance we'd fall for the same guy, because we both have very different taste when it comes to men,' she said.

'Anyone Becky is interested in, I automatically put them in the brother basket.'

The Bachelorette premieres Wednesday, October 7, at 7:30pm on Channel 10
