Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has questioned whether Memphis Depay would succeed at Barcelona after coaching him at Old Trafford.

The Lyon striker has reportedly agreed personal terms with the LaLiga giants and negotiations over a fee are now taking place between the two clubs. 

But Van Gaal, who signed Depay for £25million back in 2015, is concerned that the 26-year-old may struggle to adapt to the 'new culture' and 'new team'.

When asked if the former Manchester United No.7 flop could succeed at Barca, Van Gaal told Tutto Mercato: 'There's always a question mark. Depay is an interesting player, especially when he's free to play.

'But we have to consider adapting to a new culture and a new team. And the first year is always the hardest.

'Look at [Matthijs] De Ligt, or Frenkie de Jong.

'Depay has talent, but he's not [Lionel] Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.'

Depay started only 16 Premier League games in a season-and-a-half at United under Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho, scoring just twice.

The rigid playing systems deployed by both his managers didn't help the Dutch international to express his attacking instincts out wide or down the middle

Depay shared his frustrations with Van Gaal in his autobiography, saying: 'At United I got confused. I had to follow the tactical orders of Van Gaal, otherwise I would certainly lose my spot in the team. 

'Van Gaal doesn't like players who don't follow up on his comments.

'Meanwhile I knew I couldn't get the best out of my play this way: staying on the left side of the field, running back and forth.

'I didn't understand: you buy me because of my specific qualities you saw at PSV and the Dutch national team. After that you put me in a role where I can't play that way anymore. For me that was confusing.'

Depay's career did, however, pick up when he joined Lyon in 2017 for £15m. Since then, he helped the French side reach the Champions League semi-final - defeating Juventus and Manchester City. 

During his time at the club he has scored 57 goals in 132 games - with 11 of those being in the Champions League. 

Depay will be looking to continue such for if joins Barcelona this summer.
