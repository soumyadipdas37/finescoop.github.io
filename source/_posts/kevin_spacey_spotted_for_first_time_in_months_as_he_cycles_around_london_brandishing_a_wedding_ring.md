Kevin Spacey was seen for the first time in months on Thursday, cycling around London - and wearing a wedding ring.

The shamed actor, 61, was last spotted in public in May, having kept a very low profile recently following claims he sexually assaulted actor Antony Rapp, who was 14 at the time.

But Kevin - who was then hit by over 30 additional accusations by other men about his predatory advances - tried to get some exercise in the English capital, flashing the steel band on his wedding finger as he rode.

The American Beauty actor is not known to be in a relationship, having remained cagey about his sexual orientation for years, until the allegations from Rapp forced him to come out as gay in 2017.

He has never been married and is known for his lack of a romantic partner throughout his years in the limelight.

Kevin wore a blue zip jacket over Lycra black leggings, and added sporty cycling shoes to his get-up.

He wore a grey woolly hat and aviator shades as he cycled along the sunny north London road.
