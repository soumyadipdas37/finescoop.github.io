A stylist has sparked a rush on $25 high-waisted trousers from Kmart that look almost identical to a designer pair almost 12 times the price.

Sydney fashion blogger Angel Perez, who posts on Instagram as 'Styling Mum and Bub', caught followers' attention in early September when she shared a series of outfit photos featuring the discount store's cream coloured 'Pleated Jeans'.

They are remarkably similar to $295 palazzo pants from Australian designer label Aje, which is headquartered in Sydney's Paddington.

Both trousers have deep double-front pockets, flared hems and thick waistbands that sit high above the hips in a flattering style that conceals the tricky-to-tone expanse of the lower stomach.

Luxe for less: Sydney fashion blogger Angel Perez wears the $25 'Pleated Jeans' from Kmart, which look considerably more expensive than their bargain price tag

Women have been racing to Kmart to buy the 'perfectly elegant' discount dupe which looks considerably more expensive than its bargain price tag.

Comments on stylist Angel Perez's Instagram reveal just how taken people are with the design, with responses including 'so elegant', 'love this look' and 'beautiful pants'.

'I love how high-waisted those trousers are!' one woman replied.

Another said she'd been inspired to buy them after seeing how flattering and well tailored they appeared on Ms Perez.

It's the latest Kmart clothing to take Australian social media by storm, following an $18 maxi-skirt that flatters every body shape and a $9 shirt that's cheaper than a lunchtime sandwich.

Available in beige and a rich burgundy, the long-sleeved button-up top is winning praise on Instagram for its comfort, versatility and remarkable affordability.

There are only limited sizes of shade 'Peanut' left in stock online, but 'Shiraz' – named after the popular red wine – is still in available in six, eight, 12 and 14.

On Instagram, Melbourne stylist Maria, who posts as The Budget Savvy Girl, said she loves the 'edginess' the ribbed texture adds to an outfit.

Perth fashion blogger Louisa Sabrina agreed and said she is looking forward to summer when she plans to wear it over a crop top and linen shorts.

One follower replied: 'It's such a gorgeous shirt babe. I saw this before the lockdown, now I wish I picked it up. You look fab in it!'

Others said she had inspired them to buy the shirt, which has also been endorsed by up-and-coming influencer 'This is Genevieve'.

The Canberra fashionista - who is known for creating chic outfits from cheap clothing - paired the shirt with a pair of $20 Kmart jeans which have been flying off shelves in recent weeks.
