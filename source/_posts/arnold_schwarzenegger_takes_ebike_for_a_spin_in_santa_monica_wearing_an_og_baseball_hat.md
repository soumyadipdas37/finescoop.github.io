Proud papa: On Monday evening, Arnold had marked his youngest son Christopher's 23rd birthday with a sweet Instagram post that included a montage of photos

 A few hours earlier, Arnold had marked his youngest son Christopher's 23rd birthday with a sweet Instagram post.

The Terminator star shared a collage of images of Christopher and in the accompanying caption, he wrote: 'Happy birthday Christopher! You are such a fantastic son - kind, smart, giving, and everything I could ask for.'

He added: 'I can’t wait to see what you do with this year, but I know I’ll be proud watching! I love you!'

Meanwhile, his son Patrick, 27, posted a photo taken at his brother's birthday celebration with mom Maria Shriver, sister Christina, 29, and their famous father.

Not pictured in the family group was eldest child Katherine, 30, who recently gave birth to her first child with husband Chris Pratt. 

Arnold and Maria split in 2011 after 25 years of marriage when it was revealed the actor had fathered a son Joseph Baena with the family's former housekeeper. The exes finalized their divorce in 2017.
