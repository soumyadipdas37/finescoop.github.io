She is the Love Island star who set pulses racing in the villa.

And Georgia Harrison enjoyed a heart-racing exercise of a different kind in a throwback video with Olympian Ashley Mckenzie on Sunday, which showed her practising her judo moves last year.

The reality star, 25, grimaced as she tried out the complex judo move which saw her flip the Judoka, 31, on his back, wrapped her leg around his neck and held him in an arm lock after he pin her down during their match last year.

Georgia showed off her toned figure in a black crop top and gym leggings that had a zebra print on the the sides. 

Gushing about their session, which was for her first Judo match last year, Georgia reminisced: 'Me and @ashleyjudo training for my fight at his gym

'you are the best and I actually almost pulled this move off when you watch it back.'

Georgia certainly appeared to have done the judo move well as her opponent was seen tapping her to indicate that he yielded as she held his arm in a locked position.

Georgia first found fame with a brief stint on The Only Way Is Essex in 2014, before becoming a household name with an appearance on 2017's Love Island.

The bubbly reality star then gained an American fanbase when she starred in series 33 of The Challenge in 2018, reaching the final and finishing in eighth place.

The Challenge saw reality stars from around the world come together to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges in the hope of the scooping prize money.

During her time on the show she was involved in a tumultuous relationship with fellow Brit and Ex On The Beach star Stephen Bear, a storyline that dominated much of the series.

A year later, Georgia's quest for love continued as she signed up to Celebrity Ex On The Beach.

She was previously in a relationship with Sam Gowland, who starred on the same series of Love Island as her and then went on to have an on-off relationship with Chloe Ferry on Geordie Shore.
