She's notoriously private when it comes to her family.

But on Saturday, model Lara Worthington (née Bingle), 33, shared rare photos of her son, believed to be five-year-old Rocket, to her Instagram page.

In the black and white pictures taken inside a restaurant in the United States, her son looked adorable as he posed for the camera in a Spiderman mask and Pokémon hat.

Lara and Sam, who are now predominantly based in Los Angeles, are also proud parents to son Racer, three, and a third son believed to have been born in May.

The high-profile couple are yet to reveal the exact date of when their third child was born, as well as his name.

How does she do it? Last month, Lara (pictured), 33, revealed the secret behind her enviable post-baby body. Pictured in June,  one month after giving birth to her third son

Last month, Lara revealed the secret behind her enviable post-baby body, telling fans in an Instagram Q&A that for her, it was all about timing. 

She answered a question about postpartum fitness by writing: 'Nine months in, at least nine months out!' 

Lara chose to pair the response with a never-before-seen throwback photo from one of her pregnancies.

Soaking up the sunshine on an outdoor lounge, the former Australian Tourism star bared her burgeoning bump to the camera.

In 2019, Lara told OK! magazine that she had a varied fitness routine. 

'My routine is all mat work. Lots of sit-ups and leg lifts at high repetition at a low weight, no more than five kilos,' she explained. 'I love outdoor activities and I run a lot. I also do Ballet Beautiful – it really works your body in a different way compared to the gym.' 

Lara, who hails from Cronulla, a beachside suburb in Sydney's south, also eats a mostly vegetarian and pescatarian diet.
