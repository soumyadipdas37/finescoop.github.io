Premier League and European clubs are continuing to work hard to try and get transfer deals over the line ahead of the new season. 

Clubs have just a short period of time to bring in any new faces.

The transfer window is open until October 5 - although a domestic-only one will stretch until October 16. There are sure to be plenty of twists and turns still to come, and you can follow all the latest news and gossip with Sportsmail.

According to Italian outlet Gazzette dello Sport, the new Juventus boss said: 'Suarez is difficult because the times to get a passport are long, it is complicated that [our new striker] can be him.' 

Personal terms on a £9million-per-year deal have been concluded, and Suarez has passed a required Italian exam, but the process is stalling out. 

Nuno Espirito Santo has been searching for a replacement for Matt Doherty following his departure to Tottenham and sees Semedo as the ideal candidate, according to Fabrizio Romano for the Guardian.

The Portugal international is deemed surplus to requirements at the Catalan club as new manager Ronald Koeman tries to overhaul the squad after a traumatic season and summer.

Antonio Rudiger has not been included in today’s squad to face Liverpool - throwing his Chelsea future into doubt.

The Germany international is fully fit but manager Frank Lampard has not included the central defender in his plans to face the Premier League champions.

The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the Merseyside club after it emerged on Friday they had agreed a fee with Wolves.

The Portuguese forward arrives as part of an impressive double swoop for the Reds after confirming the £25m signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich on Friday.

However, supporters will have to wait until after the next international break for his Tottenham debut after his medical uncovered a knee injury.

Tottenham had anticipated that having barely played Bale would require more time initially to undergo a personal training programme to prepare for the rigours of the Premier League but the injury he picked up while on international duty means he is setting his sights on the home fixture with West Ham on October 17 for his possible debut.

Sevilla had rejected City’s opening offer and warned that they would need to pay the £82million buy out clause.

However, Kounde is interested in a move to City and Sevilla are now considering whether to sell for a compromise fee.

The 22-year-old was set to sign for Marcelo Bielsa's side in January 2019 before his switch from Championship Swansea collapsed on transfer deadline day.  

He joined United for £18million in June last year but barely featured at the end of last season, starting just one of the club's final 10 fixtures.

Academy product Lingard has made just two substitute appearances in the Premier League since February and was not named in United's squad as they lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace in their season opener on Saturday.

Lingard scored 13 goals in 48 matches under Mourinho during his best campaign for United in the 2017/18 season.

The midfielder’s team-mates are amazed that the England star has been left out of Jose Mourinho’s plans for the second successive game.

Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday how Alli was left in London as the rest of the squad flew to Bulgaria for the clash against Lokomotiv Plovdiv.

The Reds' recent signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich is likely to see Oxlade-Chamberlain fall down the pecking order at the club and get limited chances.

Wolves are hoping to pounce on this opportunity by offering the England international much more game time if he were to switch to Molineux. 

The French midfielder played a pivotal role in Lyon's run to the Champions League semi-finals last season and has attracted heavy interest from Mikel Arteta and the Gunners as a result.

But with the 22-year-old now one of the hottest properties in Europe, Lyon are said to be holding out for a fee within the region of £44million, which Aulas says the Gunners are unlikely to match before the close of the transfer window.

Dean Henderson, viewed as De Gea's long-term replacement, is likely to significantly reduce Romero's already limited minutes.

Romero has a year left on his current contract and with Henderson back from two loan spells at Sheffield United Solskjaer accepts Romero wants to move on.

The winger has joined the Foxes on a season-long loan and will make the deal permanent next summer. The clubs outlined an agreement with Leicester paying £2.7m for the initial loan and a further £21.9m in 12 months.

Under has made 70 Serie A appearances for Roma and has 21 caps for Turkey, scoring six international goals.

The 28-year-old had been allowed to undergo part of his medical a week ago after believing a deal was in place only to be called back when they failed to agree on a final fee. 

The deal is understood to be £22m plus add-ons with Mendy signing a five year contract. 

Kone, 19, is an athletic France U19 international who also has interest from AC Milan. 

Leeds' priority remains to add another winger while a move for Udinese's Rodrigo de Paul is on hold.
