Susanna Reid playfully called Piers Morgan 'chubster', after he revealed he had put on half a stone on in lockdown. 

Piers, 55, encouraged his co-host, 49, to fat-shame him live on Good Morning Britain on Monday, so he could use the insults as motivation to shed the pounds.  

Susanna, who admitted she had put on a stone over the past couple of months, called the columnist: 'You fat person'.

Piers said: 'Like a lot of people in lockdown, especially when you bust your ankle up, I have put on weight.

'I am carrying too much weight. I reckon I put on at least half a stone, three quarters of a stone. I need to be fat-shamed to get it off.'

Taking the bait, Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster.'

While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that.'

To which the Britain's Got Talent judge told her: 'No, that will genuinely have the right affect on me.  

'I will go back today and probably eat a little less cheese and put the second bottle away and try to get back on the Peloton for the first time in a few months.

 Chubster! Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster'

Awkward: While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that'

'I think we all need to be slightly shamed about weight.'

But Susanna disagreed and told him: 'No, I don't think shaming works. Sensible advice works. Throwing insults does not help people lose weight.'

Piers shouted: 'No, saying "stop chunking up fatso and eating so many cakes", that works. That's what you need to be told.'

The Netflix documentary maker said during their summer break he couldn't 'stop eating cheese' as he holidayed in St. Tropez with the likes of Joan Collins.
