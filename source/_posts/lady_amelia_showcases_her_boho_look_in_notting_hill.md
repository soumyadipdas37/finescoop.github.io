She has one of the edgiest wardrobes in the extended royal family, and today Lady Amelia Windsor once again showcased her boho style credentials as she stepped out in London.  

The royal, 24, who is 39th in line to the British throne, was spotted strolling through Notting Hill, looking relaxed as she made the most of the late summer sunshine. 

D&G model Amelia showcased her tanned legs in a flouncy floral skirt made up of panels of different fabrics. 

She paired the skirt with a grey sleeveless top, adding a dash of colour with a beaded necklace and gold chain.

The D&G model, who is 39th in line to the throne, looked relaxed as she soaked up the late summer sunshine, and appeared to go make-up free

Initially leaving her blonde locks flowing loosely around her shoulders for the outing, the socialiste who is the granddaughter of the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, appeared to be make-up free. 

She completed the look with a pair of leopard print trainers and carried her belongings in a straw shoulder bag. 

Later on, she pulled her hair off her face using an electric blue scrunchie she'd been wearing around her wrist. 

Some delicate bangles, with one matchine her necklace, on her both wrists completed the look.  

At one point in the outing, Lady Amelia swept her hair off her face with a blue scrunchie and cooled down with a refreshing beverage

Keeping cool in the heat, the royal was seen toting a canned beverage as she made her way through the streets.  

The royal, who graduated with a degree in Italian and French from the University of Edinburgh last year, is the granddaughter of the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent.

She is regularly snapped out and about in her local neighbourhood of Notting Hill, where she enjoys a vast-array of hobbies including pottery and ballet classes.

Lady Amelia has a blossoming following of 83,700 followers on Instagram, where she regularly posts snaps from glamorous fashion events, as well as her adventures exploring trendy parts of the capital.

Despite backlash over Londoners escaping to visit their second homes at the start of the UK's coronavirus-related lockdown, Lady Amelia fled to her parents' home in Cambridge in late March.

She shared a snap of the city dated 23 March, a week after the government advised against all non-essential travel and fears mounted that capital dwellers could be spreading the disease across the country.

Lady Amelia also revealed in April, that she invested in a multi-coloured tie dye face mask while in lockdown, and encouraged her fans to 'support small businesses' during the pandemic.

Posting on her Instagram stories, she wrote that it was an 'opportunity to support small businesses who are also donating to key workers.'

She went on to tag the brand Florence Bridge in her post, writing: 'Beautiful face masks, with 50 per cent going to @fuelourfrontline.'

Amelia has modelled for the likes of Dolce & Gabbana and designed her own range of accessories in collaboration with Penelope Chilvers.

She is represented by Storm models, which also looks after the likes of Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne.
