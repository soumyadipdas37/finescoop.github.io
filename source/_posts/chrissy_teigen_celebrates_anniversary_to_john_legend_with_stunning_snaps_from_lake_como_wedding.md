Teigen shared in her joy receiving a handmade card from her daughter, with Disney princess stickers adorning a piece of blue paper and a family photo positioned in the middle. 

'Look how cute this is,' Chrissy said as she read the card. 'Hi mommy and dad, so happy you got married. I love you, Luna.'

Another drawing depicted the happy couple hours after they said 'I do' and changed outfits for their evening reception at the Villa Pizzo in Italy.

'This is us on our wedding day,' Chrissy shared of Luna's drawing. 'I did actually have a red dress on, it was my nighttime dress. Shes' got a good memory just from old pictures.'
