Melbourne residents eager for a breather from the city's strict lockdowns have pounced on the chance to own a house with their own private beach. 

The mansion, and its exclusive slice of sand, on the Mornington Peninsula has been snapped up for an undisclosed price within the $4.5-5million price guide. 

'We had somebody through the first week of the listing and they eventually purchased the property,' McEwing and Partners director Dean Phillips told The Herald Sun. 

Melbourne residents eager for a breather from the city's strict lockdowns have pounced on the chance to own a house with their own private beach 

The mansion, and its exclusive slice of sand, on the Mornington Peninsula has been snapped up for an undisclosed price within the $4.5 - $5million price guide 

Mr Phillips said from the point the new owners decided they wanted to buy to the deal being completed was 40 days - an impressive effort considering it was accomplished during Melbourne's Stage Four cornavirus lockdown. 

The four bedroom home in Balnarring Beach is tucked away in a secluded spot with native gardens at the front which open onto the sand dunes directly from the backyard. 

Mr Phillips said the 'chance to own the sand on a private beach' was rare with such properties hard to find anywhere in the country. 

The new owners, who Mr Phillips said are business people who plan to use the property as a holiday home, managed to walk through just before private real estate inspections were banned. 

The house was built by the previous owners, a builder and stylist, who included an indoor fireplace, gas stove and waterfall kitchen bench in the two-storey property 

The new owners weren't the only ones interested either, with Mr Phillips saying the house, which shares a street with just three others was a popular listing. 

'I think in times like these, the idea of being able to walk along a beach that is right in front of your house appealed to a lot of people,' he said.

The backyard includes a self cleaning pool, sleek undercover terrace, and outdoor shower, and, of course, that private beach.
