Georgia Love paid tribute to Mike Larkan as he made his final appearance on TV on Friday after he was made redundant following Ten's brutal budget cuts last month.

The Channel 10 journalist, 31, shared a series of photos alongside the weatherman, 56, and said 'the newsroom will never be the same without you'.

'I can never put into words my gratitude and thanks for everything you've done for and taught me (and I don't just mean in the dad jokes department),' she wrote.

She continued: 'From the newsroom to the studio and all the fancy events we get to drink champagne!'

'I've admired you for as long as I can remember and getting to work alongside you and become your friend has meant more than you'll ever know,' she added.

She also paid tribute to several other members of the production team and ended: 'The newsroom will never be the same without any of you. Thank you.'

Budget cuts: Mick made his final appearance on TV on Friday following Network Ten's brutal budget cuts last month

Mike is just one of many stars who will be taking their final bow on Friday, following the network's brutal budget cuts last month.

Despite boasting decades of experience and scores of fans, the likes of Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Tim Bailey and Natarsha Belling have also all been made redundant.

Take a look at the biggest personalities you're going to miss seeing on Channel 10.  

Channel 10's darkest day: Two dozen stars - including Kerri-Anne Kennerley (pictured) and Tim Bailey - are also leaving after the network slashed jobs to save money 

Kerri-Anne Kennerley

TV veteran Kerri-Anne Kennerley is arguably the biggest name to be axed as part of Channel 10's cost-cutting measures. 

The 66-year-old, who joined Studio 10 as a part-time panellist in September 2018, fought back tears as she addressed her redundancy on air last month, telling viewers that she treasured her time on the show.

She  acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to tighten the budget, and thanked her friends and colleagues for their support.

'I just know I'm back on the 'lazy Susan' of television. Yeah, it's very, very tough for a lot of people,' she said. 

The media veteran added that by losing her job, others got to keep theirs.

'Let's face it. We've got to get down to logic here. It is what it is. It's not the first time, unfortunately. Companies do these sort of cuts to make the business better, which in the long run saves a lot more jobs,' she said.

Natarsha Belling 

Respected newsreader Natarsha Belling was sacked by Channel 10 last month after more than two decades at the network.

Making a dignified exit, Natarsha later shared a classy farewell to viewers and her former colleagues via Instagram.

The 45-year-old showed no bitterness towards Channel 10, and instead thanked her bosses for supporting her career since her early twenties.

'It's been an absolute pleasure being part of the Network 10 family for more than 22 years and I want to thank the network for all the wonderful opportunities I've enjoyed over the past two decades,' she wrote.

'During that time, I've worked with some of the very best in the TV business who have inspired me with their skill, passion and dedication,' she continued. 

Natarsha acknowledged that 2020 has been a 'challenging year for many' and has 'in many way reminded us about what truly matters in life'. 

'I'm sad to leave, but excited about the new chapter ahead. I can't wait to share with you what's coming up!' she concluded.  

Tim Bailey

Legendary weatherman Tim Bailey was also sacked as part of Channel 10's brutal budget cuts last month, after 30 years at the network.

Tim began working for Channel 10 in 1980 after scoring a job as a reporter on Good Morning Australia with Mike Gibson and Kerri-Anne Kennerley.   

The multi-talented journalist began doing the weather in 1996, and has remained in that role ever since.  

Prior to being axed, Tim presented the weather on location around New South Wales towns for Ten News at Five, and was also a fill-in news reporter.

Joe Hildebrand 

Joe Hildebrand announced he was leaving the network live on Studio 10 on Thursday.

The 44-year-old journalist broke down in tears as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to quit after seven years.  

'My time here has been wonderful': Joe Hildebrand announced he was leaving the network live on Studio 10 on Thursday

A devastated Joe began: 'I do have some news. I want to say it here first before you saw it or heard it anywhere else.

'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.

'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role. We talked about it openly and warmly about what that might look like.'  

Leaving on his own terms: Speaking of his bosses' reaction when he told them he was leaving Studio 10, Joe said: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them!'

'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of.

'I want to give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around.'



Mike Larkan

Weatherman Mike Larkan is another casualty of Channel 10's mass job cuts.

Having spent 25 years at the network, Mike admitted he was shocked to learn he was getting boned last month.

'I was caught off guard. I'll be honest... I was totally surprised when I got the phone call. I just had no idea', he told The Daily Telegraph. 

'You don't want to hear the news you are no longer in their plan going forward. But, well, I've taken that in my stride,' he added.   

'I've had a good 25 years and I've been lucky to have survived that long. There have been retrenches and I've survived those, but not quite this time.'
