They were one of the most iconic couples of the 90s. 

And Elizabeth Hurley declared her love for ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant as she sent him belated birthday wishes on Friday. 

The actress, 55, shared a hilarious throwback video of her former flame busting out some moves in the film Love Actually as she congratulated him on turning 60.

She uploaded the amusing video of Hugh - portraying the Prime Minister - shaking his stuff in a white shirt and suit trousers to the song, Jump (For My Love) by The Pointer Sisters. 

Elizabeth captioned the dedicated birthday post: 'A belated (because it took me two days to work out how to screen record) 

'Happy 60th Birthday to the glorious Hugh Grant - a magnificent addition to the human race- even though he looks like a monkey. ❤️ you forever xxxx'.

The former duo remain good friends, despite their split in 2000 when the actor was famously caught with a Hollywood prostitute eight years into their romance.

Hugh looks back on their relationship with fondness and has previously dubbed himself an 'idiot' for the sex scandal as he reflected on their strong bond. 

Speaking in a 2018 interview with Jess Cagle, the actor said: 'We’re like brother and sister... I think it’s partly because we went from zero to somewhere together.

'We went through terrible years at the beginning when neither of us had any work, living in a tiny flat. It was quite bonding.' 

The Notting Hill star hit headlines when he was arrested over two decades ago in Los Angeles for his actions involving a prostitute named Divine Brown.

He reflected on the fiasco: 'I was just an idiot. I didn’t try to say, "I’ve got this psychological problem." I just said, "I did it"'. 

Hugh is now the godfather to Elizabeth's son Damian, 18, who she had with businessman Steve Bing who passed away earlier this year. 

Elizabeth suffered a devastating blow when she discovered her ex-partner had jumped from the 27th floor of his Los Angeles apartment building in June.

The millionaire philanthropist and film financier spiralled into a deep depression and sought help for addiction multiple times before deciding to take his own life.  

Their son Damian thanked fans for their 'overwhelming kindness' following his father's suicide. 

The student took to Instagram, where he posted a photograph and shared a gratitude-filled caption alongside. The message read: 'I'd like to thank you all again for your kindness over the past few days. 

'Your love and support has helped me greatly during this challenging time.'
