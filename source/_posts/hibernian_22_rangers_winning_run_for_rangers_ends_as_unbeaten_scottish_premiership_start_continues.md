Rangers conceded their first goals of the Scottish Premiership season as Christian Doidge's header held the table toppers to a 2-2 draw on Sunday.

Drey Wright ended the visitors' remarkable seven-match run of clean sheets with the opener, only for striker Alfredo Morelos to fire an equaliser on the stroke of half-time.

Scott Arfield put Rangers back in front from close range after 57 minutes but a mistake by centre-back Connor Goldson allowed forward Doidge to head Hibs level.
