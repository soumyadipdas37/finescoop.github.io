When it comes to comfortable knickers, high-waist cotton briefs can't be beaten, and according to nearly 2,000 Amazon shoppers, TUUHAW offers some of the best. 

The under-the-radar brand offers a five-pack of cotton briefs that have quickly racked up impressive reviews. Backed by a near-perfect score of 4.6 out of 5, shoppers are raving about the pants, describing them as 'so super soft and breathable', 'so comfortable' and 'great quality'.

The five-pack of cotton briefs are available in a range of neutral colours and sizes from XS to XXXL. You can now snap up the top-rated pants in Amazon's Lightening Deal where you can get a pack of five for £15.29. Bargain. 

Hundreds of Amazon shoppers are raving about the high-waist cotton briefs from TUUHAW- and, you can now grab them in Amazon's Lightning Deal for £15.29 for a pack of five 

While it might not win any awards for the sexiest pair around, the soft and breathable fabric ticks big boxes for comfort. In fact, the TUUHAW High Waist Knickers have been described as so comfortable that some shoppers can't feel them on. 

One shopper wrote: 'So comfortable you can't feel them on, best draws I've had so far for comfort and smoothness, wash up well too.'

Reviewers have been quick to praise the double-layered, high-rise design that gently supports the tummy and creates a flattering silhouette. Providing coverage and comfort, it's no surprise that these are a well-loved option. 

'These are SO comfy! I originally bought them to wear with white/ light dresses to try to make my underwear less visible when wearing them but I wear them almost all the time because they are just so comfy and snug. Highly recommend!.'

Another raved about the TUUHAW High Waist Knickers, writing: 'They're the best knickers I've ever found to be comfortable, non-riding up or non-rolling down. I know they're a bit grannyish, but, when you get to my age (64!) all you want is comfort these days, and they certainly do the job. Would fully recommend these to anyone.'

A third reviewer added: 'These are great knickers. They are very comfortable and don't leave a panty line, seamlessly fitting to the body. They fit amazingly and don't sag. I'm impressed with the quality of the product as they will last longer than the basic knickers you can buy at leading chain stores.'

The pants sit right at the waist covering the belly button, so you'll not experience any uncomfortable rolling or bunching

Thanks to the seamless fit, the cotton briefs are ideal for wearing under dresses without a give-away waistband. Even better, the no-waistband means it won't dig uncomfortably into the skin throughout the day.  

'They are the most comfortable knickers I have worn, in fact, I have ordered a second pair. They do not pinch around the legs, and the waistband is exactly where it should be. Well worth the money.'

Underwear can quickly get pricey, so it's often best to buy in bulk. With five cotton briefs to a pack for just £15.29, these are an affordable option which is sure to get a lot of use.
