Justin Bieber is ushering in a 'new era' after dropping his latest single Holy with Chance the Rapper on Friday.

And the Grammy winner is keeping busy with new music, as he continues to curate this new image.

He cut a streetwear casual look Friday in Drew House and Fear of God Essentials, as he left a recording studio in Los Angeles, just hours after dropping the music video for his new track.

The 26-year-old paired an oversized white Fear of God t-shirt with some grey basketball shorts from his own line, printed with 'Drew' across the crotch.

He sported a white pair of the new Yeezy Foam Runners, paired with some blush socks, also featuring the Drew House logo.

Justin finished the casual ensemble with an army green cuffed Nike beanie over his shaggy blond hair.

He ditched the face mask for this outing, as he appeared to bypass any safety precautions on his way into the building.

The Canadian pop star previously dropped the video for Holy, which featured cameos from Chance the Rapper, Wilmer Valderrama and Ryan Destiny.

He teased the song earlier this week on Twitter, as he attempted to shed his often problematic image for something of a moral Christian nature: 'New era. New single. It’s begins.'

Justin plays a laid-off oil rig worker in the video, who ends up homeless along with his wife (Ryan), before being offered a warm plate by a passing soldier (Valderrama).

Although the message doesn't quite land visually, coming from someone who's never had to do manual labor a day in their life, the song appears to be more about how his marriage to wife Hailey, 23, is comparable to his faith in God.

For Hailey: The song appears to be about how his marriage to wife Hailey, 23, is comparable to his faith in God

He sings: 'Runnin' to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy'

The Yummy artist married Hailey in September of 2018 at a New York City courthouse, after reuniting at a Christian conference in June (they originally dated from December, 2015 to January, 2016), and popping the question in July.

He celebrated their second anniversary last weekend on Instagram, writing: '2 years today @haileybieber .. xoxo'

The power couple dropped $25.8million last month on their new home, a 11,145-square-foot, seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion in the upscale Beverly Park neighborhood of Beverly Hills.
