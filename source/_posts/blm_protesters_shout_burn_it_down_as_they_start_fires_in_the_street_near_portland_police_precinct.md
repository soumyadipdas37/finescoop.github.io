Black Lives Matter protestors chanted 'burn it down' and lit raging fires in the street near a police precinct in Portland as they took to the streets on the 101st night of demonstrations in the city.  

A rally and march at Alberta Park was scheduled to take place on Sunday night but authorities later received word that crowds had gathered outside the North Precinct blocking traffic.   

Shortly after 10pm, the Portland Police Bureau issued a warning to the demonstrators on Twitter which read: 'To those gathered at North Precinct: You are not to enter the property of North Precinct. Southeast Emerson Street is closed between NE MLK and NE 6th Ave. 

'If you enter the property, you are trespassing and subject to arrest, citation, and/or the use of crowd control munitions.'

Firefighters were called to the scene a short time later to put out fires at the protest site, according to police, who urged protesters to move away from the blaze.

One video from the scene showed what appeared to be a mattress engulfed in flames as crowds chanted 'burn it down' in reference to the precinct. 

It comes after 59 people, ranging in age from 15 to 50, were arrested on Saturday as hundreds more gathered for rallies and marches.

The majority of arrests were over low-level misdemeanors that  Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said he will dismiss, Oregon Live reports.  

Molotov cocktails thrown in the street during a march sparked a large fire and prompted police to declare a riot.  

Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 

Protestors have broken windows, set fires and pelted police with rocks during the clashes which continue to rumble on.

Earlier Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in a park just north of Portland in Vancouver, Washington, for a memorial service for Aaron 'Jay' Danielson. 

Danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer, was shot and killed August 29 after a pro-Trump caravan cruised through downtown Portland. 

The suspected killer was fatally shot by police Thursday.
