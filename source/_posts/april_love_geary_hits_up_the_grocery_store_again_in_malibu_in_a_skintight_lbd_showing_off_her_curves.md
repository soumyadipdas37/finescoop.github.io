She recently honored her 'bestie' daughters with a loving tribute on the occasion of National Daughters Day. 

And model April Love Geary was a vision in black on Saturday, showing off her figure in a form-fitting black sleeveless dress that ended above her knees while shopping in Malibu, California.

Her body-hugging dress featured pull ties on either side of the hem, hanging by April's legs.

The wife of Robin Thicke wore her 'VOTE' black face mask, and had her large sunglasses up in her luxurious light brown hair.   

The catwalker, 25, carried her gold-chained quilted black leather Yves Saint Laurent purse, which hung from her shoulder.

She wore heather grey sneakers with white laces on her feet.

Geary stocked up on Evian water and Coca-Cola at Vintage Grocers in Malibu, placing the items in the trunk of her large black SUV. 

On Friday, the young mother uploaded a sweet snap of her two daughters to Instagram, in honor of National Daughters Day.

In the image, her older daughter Mia Love, two, cuddled up next to a colorful stuffed bear, while the younger Lola Alain, one, leaned in from the side.

The girls were covered in a Halloween pumpkin-patterned fleece blanket, and Mia held a plastic spider – clearly, they're ready for the upcoming holiday. 

Mom April captioned the cosy snap, 'Happy national daughter day to my lil besties' along with a flower emoji. 

And while April and Robin, 43, are proud parents to the two girls, rumors have been swirling about whether or not they are expecting a third child. 

 Geary has spent a lot of time discussing women's reproductive rights and birth control on her social media, as seen on her Instagram Story on Saturday, but has yet to confirm whether she's currently expecting.
