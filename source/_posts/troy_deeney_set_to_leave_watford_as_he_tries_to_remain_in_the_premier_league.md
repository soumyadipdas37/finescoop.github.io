Watford will not stand in Troy Deeney’s way - with the long-serving striker set to leave the relegated club.

Sources have disclosed that the Hornets do not wish to lose the 32-year-old but are now willing to listen to offers.

Insiders say that the club will not block a move for their captain should they receive an offer they feel meets his value.

One option could be a season-long loan deal, with Deeney returning to Watford should they achieve promotion at the first attempt.

Birmingham-born Deeney has been at Vicarage Road for a decade after joining from Walsall in 2010.

Last week he declared that he still sees himself as a Premier League striker. During an injury-ravaged campaign he scored 10 goals and is now back to full fitness.

Deeney recently made his debut on talkSPORT and is understood to have signed a lucrative deal with the broadcaster.

The high profile that remaining in the top flight brings may well be attractive as he considers his future.
