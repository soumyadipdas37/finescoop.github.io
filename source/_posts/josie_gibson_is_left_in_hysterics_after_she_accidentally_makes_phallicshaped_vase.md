Josie Gibson was left in hysterics when she tried out glassblowing for the first time which led to unintentionally hilarious results.

The presenter, 35, enjoyed a holiday in Loch Ness, Scotland, during Monday's edition of This Morning when she decided to visit a glass factory in town.

Delighted at being able to try out the hobby, Josie accidentally made a phallic-shaped vase after blowing on the glass with gusto.

Amusing: Josie Gibson was left in hysterics after she accidentally made a phallic-shaped vase while trying out glass-blowing in Scotland, which was shown on Monday's This Morning

Before she made the amusing decoration, Josie explained to viewers: 'The technique of glassblowing has been around for over 2000 years.

'That flame is 4000 degrees Fahrenheit, and when you heat the glass you can start blowing it to make different shapes.'

She burst out laughing when she saw her phallic-shaped vase, as she joked: 'That's an interesting shape isn't it?'

The professional glass blower, who was also in hysterics, praised Josie by saying: 'That's the most perfect bubble I've seen in a long time, I love it.'

In July, Josie revealed that her former partner Terry has moved out of her home once again, after he re-entered the lives of her and Reggie.

At the start of June, the former Big Brother winner admitted that she was still in love with her ex, after he moved back into her home during the COVID-19 lockdown.

But the Bristolian has now told new! magazine of Terry: 'He's moved out now. I'm choosing to do it on my own for a little bit at the moment. My sisters help, I'm very lucky. I want to put all my efforts into being a mum.'

The bubbly TV personality also went on to share her ambitions for her sole offspring, saying: 'I want Reg to grow into something amazing, like a space engineer, something like that. I want him to excel.'

Josie and Terry initially went their separate ways just four months after Reggie was born, with the star admitting that the pair 'never got on'.

However, her words were far more glowing in June, when she made appearance on ITV's Loose Women ahead of Terry moving out.

She said of her complicated relationship with her ex: 'He is one of those people you can't live with you can't live without. Terry is asthmatic, so we waited for three weeks. I couldn't take Reggie to the supermarket anymore so he moved in.'

On how they were coping with residing under the same roof, the reality star said: 'We have never got on so well.'
