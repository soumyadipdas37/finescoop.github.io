The great debate between which franchise has the biggest and best fan base, between Star Wars and Star Trek, gets a new wrinkle with an ad from UberEats.

Star Wars icon Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy and the recent sequel trilogy, squared off against Patrick Stewart, whose portrayal of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation revitalized the Star Trek franchise in the 1980s and 1990s.

Both Hamill, 68, and Stewart, 80, squared off in the humorous ad, which debuted on Monday after both actors gave fans a sneak peek on social media on Sunday.

Showdown: The great debate between which franchise has the biggest and best fan base, between Star Wars and Star Trek, gets a new wrinkle with an ad from UberEats

The ad is set in an abandoned warehouse, as Hamill approaches carrying a baseball bat, clad in black.

He turns to the camera and says, 'Tonight, I'll be eating a veggie cheeseburger on ciabatta, no tomatoes,' as he sees Stewart approaching.

Stewart, clad in a black and grey ensemble and carrying what appears to be a cricket mallet, approaches and looks into the camera.

'Tonight, I'll be eating four cheese tortellini with extra tomatoes,' he says while glancing at Hamil.

Hamil menacingly says, 'Stewart, so it's come to this,' but his speech is interrupted by a doorbell and his UberEats arriving, as he turns and says 'Thank you.'

Stewart's meal arrives as well, as he turns to the delivery person and says, 'Bravo,' before they both start raising their blunt weapons.

'Careful, Hamill, daddy's not here to save you,' Stewart says, egging his supposed rival on, while Hamil retorts, 'Oh I am my daddy!'

Naturally, Stewart is quite confused, adding, 'Come again?' as Hamill tries to make sense of it all as well, adding, 'Wait, what? You said, "Daddy's not here to save you..."

'What the hell are you talking about?' Stewart asks, as the ad cuts to an UberEats bag and the tagline, 'Tonight I'll be eating...' as Hamill is heard saying, 'I'm not sure I got that right' as the ad comes to a close.

Stewart also tweeted the ad out, teasing that this debate in the ad is even greater than the long-lasting debate between Star Wars and Star Trek.

'Honoured to have battled it out with @hamillhimself to settle one of the greatest debate of all time: what’s for dinner?' Stewart said, adding #ad and @ubereats.

Hamil also tweeted out the ad, repeating one of his lines from the commercial, with, 'So it’s come to this @sirpatstew ...' adding the #ad hashtag and @ubereats.
