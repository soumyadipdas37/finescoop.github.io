Erling Haaland scored a brilliant brace as Norway hammered Northern Ireland 5-1 at Windsor Park in their opening Nations League game. 

Mohamed Elyounoussi opened the scoring after just two minutes but Paddy McNair quickly restored parity, only for Erling Haaland to volley beyond a helpless Bailey Peacock-Farrell. 

Alexander Sorloth gave the visitors a two-goal advantage on 19 minutes and doubled his tally by tapping in from Haaland's cross after the interval, with the Borussia Dortmund forward firing into the top corner to secure victory.
