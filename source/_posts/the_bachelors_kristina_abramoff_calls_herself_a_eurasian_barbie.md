Kristina Abramoff is one of the breakout stars on the latest season of The Bachelor. 

And the 24-year-old beauty certainly looked eye-catching as she posed in a skimpy pink bralette and matching skirt on Monday.

Taking to Instagram, Kristina flashed the flesh in the racy outfit which ensured she emphasised her toned midriff.

Think Pink! On Monday, The Bachelor's Kristina Abramoff, 24, (pictured) flaunted her toned midriff in a bralette and skimpy skirt in an Instagram photo shoot 

The beauty was toned and tanned in the outfit, which clung to her slender figure and also offered a generous glimpse of her cleavage. 

Meanwhile, she carried her belongings in a Jacquemus bag. 

Kristina opted for a glossy makeup style which she paired with dark eye makeup and a matte lipstick. She wore her chestnut tresses down.

'Eurasian Barbie,' she captioned the photograph.

On Friday, the 24-year-old offered proof she had completed her Bachelor's degree amid claims she is a paid actress who only went on the show for fame.

Sharing a video to her YouTube account, the brunette answered several burning questions during a 12-minute Q&A session about her experience on the reality series.

'No, I don't have a degree. Absolutely do not have a degree. I just made this up,' she sarcastically told the camera, as she held-up her certificate.

Kristina then went on to explain that her PhD, which she is currently working towards, is on clinical research and is focused on type one diabetes.
