A woman charged with murdering her ex-partner with an axe was caught on camera calmly smoking a cigarette outside before getting into a taxi.

Police rushed to a Sydney Street home at St Marys, in Sydney's west, after welfare concerns were raised for Geo Sione, 35.

He was found dead in his bed with severe head wounds, believed to be from an axe.

CCTV shows Mr Sione's former partner, 34-year-old Naea Moli, standing outside the home smoking a cigarette before getting into a taxi and going to St Marys Police Station.

She was questioned for hours before being charged with murder, Nine News reported.

NSW Police Detective Inspector Jason Pietruska said the woman was calm when she appeared at the police station on Sunday. 

'Her demeanor was calm. She was matter-of-fact about what had occurred. She spoke with police freely and that information led us to the location,' he said. 

Investigation found the couple had a history of violence in the relationship and were known to police. 

'Obviously this is a horrific incident. It shows what can happen, at its worst, regarding domestic violence,' Detective Inspector Pietruszka said.

He described the scene as 'disturbing' and 'horrific' with Mr Sione suffering from extensive head injuries.

Mr Sione and his ex-partner had been in a relationship for ten years and had arrived in Sydney just recently after moving from New Zealand.

NSW Police had been in the process of taking an AVO out on Moli.

Neighbours described the pair as quiet and keeping to themselves after moving into the apartment in February. 

Moli fronted Penrith Local Court on Monday where she was refused bail.
