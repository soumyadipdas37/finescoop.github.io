Former pro surfer Ellie Jean-Coffey has hit back at her critics after being slammed for selling nude photos and videos of herself online. 

The 25-year-old said that her decision to launch her own subscription-based website has been incredibly lucrative. 

'At the end of the day, anyone who succeeds in life is going to receive criticism, and that's just part of the business,' she told news.com.au.

'Every decision I make is calculated, so it was not just an overnight decision, but a decision that I knew would lead to the success it has been,' she continued.

'I did speak to my family by the time I had all the information regarding what the website entailed, and they’ve all been extremely supportive.'

The blonde bombshell said that launching her own X-rated business has been 'liberating and empowering' - and the most successful thing she's ever done.

On Ellie's website, she offers access to content including spanking videos and photos of herself 'handcuffed to the bed' and 'completely topless with my legs spread'.

These photos and videos can be unlocked for a fee of $10 per month, similar to content on X-rated site OnlyFans.

Ellie-Jean first came to prominence as a junior star who won the Australasian Pro Series.

Despite her success in the ocean, Ellie found more popular on Instagram, where she racked up one million followers thanks to her bikini-clad selfies. 

Her three sisters, Ruby-Lee, 20, Bonnie-Lou, 18, and Holly-Daze, 22, have all followed in her footsteps by becoming surfers and Instagram models.

At one time, the siblings were dubbed the 'Kardashians of Australian surfing' and were in talks for their own reality show.

Holly recently followed big sister Ellie into adult entertainment by launching her own X-rated website too. 

'Upskirt action with no panties,' she captioned one image, which was hidden behind a paywall.  

Besides explicit photos and videos, subscribers also get the chance to chat to Holly and Ellie online.
