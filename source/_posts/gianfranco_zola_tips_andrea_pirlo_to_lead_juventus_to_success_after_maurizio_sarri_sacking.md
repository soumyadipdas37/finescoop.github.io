Former Chelsea coach Gianfranco Zola says he was sorry to see Maurizio Sarri lose his job but has commended Juventus for the 'courageous' appointment of Andrea Pirlo.

Zola worked as Sarri's assistant at Stamford Bridge in 2018-19 as Blues won the Europa League, but the pair were replaced with Frank Lampard and his management team at the end of the season. 

Zola struggled during spells in charge of West Ham, Watford and Cagliari, but the Italian believes Andrea Pirlo has the 'superior knowledge' required to be successful at Juventus. 



'I went to West Ham without ever having coached and I know what that means,' Zola told Corriere della Sera. 'We are talking about a champion who had superior knowledge of the game.

'Andrea must grow up quickly, choosing him was very courageous and it could become a brilliant move.'

Sarri led the Old Lady to a ninth successive Serie A title, but failure to progress beyond the last 16 of the Champions League convinced chairman Andrea Agnelli to replace Sarri with Pirlo



Zola expressed disappointment after his former colleague was dismissed but acknowledged the high standards held by the Juventus board.

'I'm a little sorry for him and his group, I worked with hem for a year at Chelsea and it was very important for me,' he added.

'We talked about it with Maurizio, that Juventus are a demanding team and sometimes it's not even enough to win.

'There are many requirements that must be met.'
