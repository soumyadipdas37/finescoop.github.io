Arsenal have been set a Friday deadline to complete the signing of Houssem Aouar by Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. 

The Gunners are determined to sign the 22-year-old this summer and are set to raise their dismissed £32million offer to £36.5m with a further £9m in bonuses in a hope to secure the creative midfielder, according to football.london. 

Aulas is also braced for late bids for forwards Moussa Dembele and Memphis Depay.

He told footmercato.net: 'I'm thinking of proposing it tomorrow (Tuesday) to Rudi (Garcia) and Juninho, sporting director), because it's understandable.

'As of Friday, players who have not left will not leave. We don't need to sell and, for me, it's very easy to say that. 

'After that, we can find agreements with players and clubs for a year to come.'  

Aouar, who has made 130 appearances for Lyon, is paramount to Mikel Arteta's plans as he looks to deploy his team in a 4-3-3 formation this season.

Despite rejecting their opening offer, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas suggested that the club would be open to selling Aouar for the right price.

He tweeted: 'For Houssem Arsenal is too far from his value: we are counting on him to play a great match in Lorient and lead OL in CL next year.'

Aouar has been previously valued at £54m but it is believed the Ligue 1 side will lower their asking price amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Aouar is reportedly keen to depart the Ligue 1 club before the end of the transfer window, meaning any deal must be completed before the deadline on October 5.
