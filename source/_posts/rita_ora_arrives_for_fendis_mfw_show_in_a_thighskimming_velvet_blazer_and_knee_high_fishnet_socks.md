She has never been afraid to experiment when it comes to her wardrobe.

The singer, 29, showcased her incredible physique in a velour black blazer but suffered an awkward mishap as she arrived for the show.

Rita accidentally flashed her underwear in the thigh-skimming blazer, which had a v cut at the back and dramatic shoulder pads. 

The Anywhere hitmaker seemed unperturbed by the fashion faux pas as she strutted into the catwalk show in knee-high fishnets and black heels. 

She slicked her blonde hair back into a low bun and amped up the glamour with diamond earrings, a gold phone chain and shades.

Rita has spent the summer holidaying in Ibiza and Greece with her new boyfriend Romain Gavras, 39.

The singer and the French director were first seen together in July after a night of partying.  

Speaking to The Sun, friends insisted Rita was involved with the filmmaker after she was seen enjoying a boozy evening out with business tycoon Faton Gashi.

A source said: 'Rita was hitting the town with friends including Faton. But she's in a serious thing with Romain and properly loved up. It's the first time she's been serious with someone in ages.'

Rita's previous boyfriends include Calvin Harris, Andrew Garfield, Rob Kardashian, musician Andrew Watt and Ricky Hil - the son of fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.
