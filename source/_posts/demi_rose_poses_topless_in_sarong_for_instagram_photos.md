'Then in 2018, my dad passed away from cancer, then my mum, after being sick for so long, she passed away from a stomach infection. So it was really hard.'

On how she deals with the grief, the said: 'I mean, it was really difficult, I've gone through stages of feeling my worst and now I'm at a place where I feel a lot better. It just takes time really.

'I have some amazing friends and I do meditation. I have a lot of faith, so I pray and sound healing. I love sound healing.'
