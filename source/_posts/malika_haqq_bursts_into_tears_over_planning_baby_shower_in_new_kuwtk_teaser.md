Malika Haqq cried to sister Khadijah and pal Khloé Kardashian over planning her baby shower in the new teaser for the 19th season premiere of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which airs this Thursday on E!

The preview began with the 37-year-old then mom-to-be telling her 36-year-old best friend since 1999 and her 37-year-old twin that she wanted to limit the guest list for her February 9 baby bash to '50 people.'

'Someone who says they don't want to be around a lot of people, I'm just saying, I think 55 is a lot of f***ing people,' Khloé told her on the phone.

Shower invite list: The preview began with the 37-year-old then mom-to-be telling her 36-year-old best friend since 1999 and her 37-year-old twin that she wanted to limit the guest list for her February 9 baby bash to '50 people' 

Malika then noted how her babydaddy O.T. Genasis - whom she split from in June 2019 after two years - wanted his mother to be able to bring her 'six sisters' to the shower.

'I mean, I'm five seconds from not wanting a f***ing shower anyways,' Haqq stressed.

'Like, planning and who can and can't come, and who's involved and who's not involved - that s*** is annoying to me. And it's not becoming what Malika wants it to be, it's becoming what everyone else wants it to be.'

After hanging up on them, Kardashian and Haqq called her back to discover she was crying.

'I'm just really stressed out!' Malika exclaimed.

'It's not enough. I'm not in the best situation. I'm trying to do the best that I can and like even little s*** that I'm supposed to enjoy, like my shower.'

Later in a confessional interview, the Good American co-founder said her pregnant friend 'bursting into tears' has 'something to do with OT.'

'It's something that's deeper than us,' Khloé said.
