They share two children and had one of Hollywood's most steadfast relationships.

And four years on from splitting publicly after falling out of love, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber continue to prove they are still the best of friends.

The father to Kai, 11, and Sasha, 13, took to Instagram on Tuesday to amicably wish the mother of his children the happiest of birthdays.

‘You are the best ex ever’: Liev Schreiber was hailed by fans for his touching tribute to former partner Naomi Watts on her 52nd birthday on Monday 

'Happy Birthday Mama!!!' the 52-year-old wrote alongside a picture he uploaded of his ex-partner, also 52.

Liev's celebration of Naomi's special day was received with warmness by fans, who hailed his actions as mature, kind and inspirational.

'You are the best ex-husband ever. You are an inspiration,' one commented. 

'I have so much respect for couples that are not longer together but have the love, respect and maturity to continue to celebrate each other,' another wrote. 

'They're clearly on great terms. it's lovely to see affection survive between parents at the end of a romantic relationship,' a third fan posted.

Others were seen joking about Liev calling Naomi 'mama' and corrected anyone wishing his real mother a happy birthday.

Liev and Naomi never married and were together for 11 years when they split in September 2016. 

They have spoken openly about their approach to co-parenting and have been very verbal in remaining friends in the years following their break up.  

And they are still regularly seen spending time together - particularly with their sons throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

The family self-isolated at a home in The Hamptons in April and were previously staying in LA with Liev's model girlfriend, Taylor Neisen, during the pandemic. 

It is unclear if Taylor, 26, hunkered down with the family in The Hamptons. 

The family also thrilled fans when they did a TikTok dance routine - performing Doja Cat's hit single Say So - to beat boredom - as part of the viral 'He-ain't-never-seen-it-in-a-dress-like-this' challenge.
