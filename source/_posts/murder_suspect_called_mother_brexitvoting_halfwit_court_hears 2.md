A psychologist who killed his mother by bludgeoning her to death with a hammer described her as a 'Brexit-voting halfwit', a court has heard.

Robert Child, 37, admitted murdering his mother Janice, 64, who was found locked in a bloodstained utility room under the stairs of her home in Woolton, Liverpool on March 6. 

The psychologist transferred £25,000 to his bank account from hers moments after leaving her home on March 5, and when police went to inform him of her death the following morning he was out buying a £14,000 Jaguar car.

He denies he killed his mother for financial gain, Liverpool Crown Court heard.      

Giving evidence via videolink today, Child's friend Philip Walker, who worked with him at the University of Liverpool, said he had the impression Child did not get on with his mother.

He said Child forwarded him a message sent by Mrs Child in February, in which she suggested he stockpile food because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The court heard Child then referred to his mother as 'the Brexit-voting halfwit'.

Mr Walker, who shared an interest in crypto-currency with the defendant, said: 'He was against Brexit.'

Mrs Child was found with 31 wounds, believed to have been caused by a hammer and another weapon, after neighbours contacted police when they were alerted by her dachshund Alfie barking in the early hours of the morning.

The court has heard Child claimed to be a doctor, despite not having completed a PhD, and told friends he worked as an analyst for Manchester United.

PC Nicola Ireland told the court Child asked 'is this a dream' when he was arrested on suspicion of his mother's murder at the home he shared with his partner in Thingwall, Wirral, on March 6.

She said: 'He immediately began to shake, displaying signs of being extremely anxious.'

She said on their way to the police station, Child said: 'I only wanted to show her my new car.'

Police were called to Mrs Child's home in the early hours of March 6 after neighbours were alerted by the sound of her dog Alfie barking, Liverpool Crown Court heard 

She added: 'I took her to mean Janice, he didn't specifically say her name.'

He told her his mother had 'cut him out of her life' for a period of time because she did not approve of his previous partner due to the 'colour of her skin' - but they had since reconciled, the court heard.

In evidence from financial investigator Adrian McGrath, the court heard Child was more than £32,000 in debt at the time of his mother's death.

He also had two county court judgments against him for £16,000, Mr McGrath said.

He said Child did have a joint savings account with his mother which had more than £14,000 in, enough to cover the cost of the Jaguar, and would have been able to access it without his mother's signature.

But, the court heard, a passbook was needed to credit or debit the account and only one was issued.

The case was adjourned until Wednesday.
