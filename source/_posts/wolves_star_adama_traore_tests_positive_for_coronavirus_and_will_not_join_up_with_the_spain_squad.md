Wolves attacker Adama Traore will not meet up with the Spain squad after he tested positive for coronavirus, according to Marca.

Every member of Luis Enrique's Spain squad, called up for their Nations League matches against Germany and Ukraine, had to complete a covid-19 test amid the pandemic.

The positive test not only comes as a blow to Traore, but to Spain too who have now lost their second player due to the virus after Mikel Oyarzabal tested positive before.

The Wolves speedster will no longer join up with the squad in order to comply with UEFA's strict safety protocol. 

The 24-year-old has endured a frustrating season with the national team, after he had to pull out due to injury after his only other senior call-up back in November.

However, at club level Traore has shone as he managed to score six goals and rack up 12 assists in all competitions for Nuno Espirito Santo's Wolves.

His efforts have not gone unnoticed, with Manchester City and Liverpool set to battle it out for the winger's signature as the Midlands club are made aware they may have to sell him to raise funds cue to covid-19.

Barcelona, where Adama rose through the academy and into the first team, are another club who have shown an interest. 

Further testing is now set to take place around the Spain squad as the camp are required to do so in line with UEFA's protocol.

Traore will take another covid-19 test on Tuesday, which if returned negative, will mean he can travel to Spain.
