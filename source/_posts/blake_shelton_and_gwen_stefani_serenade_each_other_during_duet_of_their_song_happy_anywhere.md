Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani released their fourth collaboration, Happy Anywhere, back in July. 

And the lovebirds serenaded each other with their Hot 100 hit, during Wednesday night's Academy of Country Music Awards. 

They sang on a green-screen set made to look like Nashville's iconic Blue Bird Cafe, the original performance location, though it was broadcast from Los Angeles.

For the performance, the God's Country singer sat on a stool while strumming on a guitar. 

He opted for a simple button-up collard shirt in a dark blue color and dark wash denim jeans. 

While the No Doubt alum, 50, decided on an all white look in a three-quarter sleeve white denim jacket, with gold fringe on the back, cut-off fringed shorts and a white tank. 

She added to her look with gold bracelets and layered necklaces, black fishnet leggings and gold boots.

'Hey guys, Blake here, and I hope everyone out there is doing their best to stay healthy,' The Voice judge said before singing. 

Adding: 'Gwen and I wish that we could be in Nashville tonight, but we couldn't.'

Kicking off their performance, the couple, who began dating in 2015, sat in an empty room, with a green-screened floor and plain green walls. 

Only their stools, Blake's microphone stand and a speaker with them, at the snap of the country singer's fingers, the room transformed into the Blue Bird Cafe.
