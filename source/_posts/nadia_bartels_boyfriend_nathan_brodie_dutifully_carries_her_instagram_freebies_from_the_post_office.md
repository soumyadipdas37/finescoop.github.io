Meanwhile, Nathan was spotted in two different outfits, having visited the post office in a baggy jumper and black shorts, before changing into a grey T-shirt and denim shorts for the coffee run.  

He attempted to shield his mouth and nose behind a black scarf, but ran into trouble when the garment slightly fell down from his face. 

Their new romance comes just over one year after Nadia announced her split from former AFL star Jimmy Bartel.

Nadia and Jimmy share two young sons - Aston, four, and Henley, one.   

In a statement to The Herald Sun at the time, she said: 'It's been a very difficult month for me and the boys.'

'Although I'm heartbroken, I don't want to comment specifically on what's been reported about Jim's trip to the UK as I don't think that is in anyone's interests.

'My single focus now is to continue to protect, care and provide for my two beautiful boys as this is a personal matter. I am so thankful for my very supportive family and friends,' she concluded.

Soon after the split was announced, Jimmy went public with his new girlfriend, office worker Lauren Mand. 

Staying mum: Nadia has yet to publicly acknowledge her blossoming romance

Different lifestyles: While Nadia enjoys keeping her fans entertained on Instagram as much as possible, Nathan posts on the social media platform far less frequently
