Hollywood couple Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann were spotted enjoying a stroll in Los Angeles this Saturday.

The 48-year-old cut a summery figure in a pink floral skirt with some lace fringe around its hemline.

Meanwhile her 52-year-old director husband wore a brownish grey polo shirt with casual black shorts and white sneakers.

In one heartwarming moment the duo could be seen apparently skipping while arm in arm in a parking lot. 

Both of them made sure to wear masks before heading out on their walk in keeping with coronavirus safety protocols.

Leslie showed off her still amazingly trim figure in a skintight white tank top and wore her blonde hair down.

Both of them brought sunglasses with them though Judd hung them from his neckline while Leslie kept hers on her face.

She complemented her ensemble with a pair of pink Gucci slippers that featured the brand's logo in silver on the straps.

The pair have been married since 1997 and share daughters Maude, 22, and Iris, 17, who have both become actresses like their mother.

Along with being his wife Leslie has also acted in multiple of Judd's projects including movies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up and This Is 40.

Leslie was not featured in Judd's latest film The King Of Staten Island starring Pete Davidson - however Maude did have a role in the movie.

Next year Leslie will be seen as leading lady Elvira in a film adaptation of Noel Coward's beloved darkly comic play Blithe Spirit.
