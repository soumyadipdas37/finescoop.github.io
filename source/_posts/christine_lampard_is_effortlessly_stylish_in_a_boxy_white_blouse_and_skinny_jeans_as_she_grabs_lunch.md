She always manages to look effortlessly chic.

And Christine Lampard kept her cool in the balmy London weather on Monday as she slipped into another stylish ensemble. 

Keeping things casual, the 41-year-old presenter kept things casual in a boxy white blouse and skinny jeans as she nipped out to pick up some lunch.

Christine seemed in good spirits as she popped into burger joint Five Guys for lunch, bringing the food back home with her. 

Although takeaways are a rare treat for the star, she recently told The Telegraph that her eating habits start to slip throughout the day.

She confessed: 'I generally follow the motto of eating like a king, then a prince, then a pauper, as the day goes on, and I need a good breakfast.' 

Christine revealed that she has also been following Joe Wicks aka The Body Coach's recipes during the coronavirus pandemic, and has no doubt kept fit running around after her daughter Patricia, 12 months, who she shares with husband Frank.

The Chelsea coach has been married to Christine since 2015, and he recently told The High Performance Podcast that she offers him sensible advice about how to manage his team.

Frank - who also starred for Chelsea before he turned to coaching - said: 'She definitely coaches me. And I do throw a lot of things off Christine.

'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home [and ask].

'It's a different view, a different opinion.'

Frank admits he values Christine's outlook on some of the situations he faces on a day-to-day basis, and the former England star is happy to approach his wife for tips.

He said: 'Sometimes, I go, "Christine, what do you think about this problem? I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday. But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?"

'And she goes, "Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them." And I'm like, "yeah". I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'
