Liverpool are worrying about the fitness of Jordan Henderson who was injured during the Merseysiders' Premier League clash away at Chelsea on Sunday.

The Reds captain did not reappear for the second-half at Stamford Bridge due to a thigh issue and was replaced by new signing Thiago at the interval. 

Henderson played a key role in the Liverpool midfield as the Premier League champions stifled Chelsea's plans to be effective on the counter attack during the opening period.

The 30-year-old's final touch of the game was a superb through ball which allowed Sadio Mane to run through on goal. The winger was brought down by Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen, who was shown a red card for the foul after a VAR check. 

Henderson's tight thigh paved the way for new Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara to make his Premier League debut on Sunday evening.

The Spanish midfielder joined from European champions Bayern Munich in a £25million move earlier this week but started the match against Chelsea on the substitutes' bench.

Thiago is one of three new Liverpool signings made by head coach Jurgen Klopp this summer, following the arrivals of left-back Kostas Tsimkas from Olympiacos and Wolves winger Diogo Jota. 

The move for Thiago means the blow of losing Henderson is softened for Klopp, as Liverpool also have Georginio Wijnaldum, Naby Keita, James Milner, Fabinho and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the club. 

But the thigh issue could be a potential concern for Gareth Southgate and the England squad with Henderson acting as one of the vocal leaders in the national team's dressing room.

The Three Lions' next international match is in two-and-a-half weeks' time when they face home ties against Wales, Belgium and Denmark in early October. 

Liverpool also have a busy fixture list coming up with the Carabao Cup beginning next week and a difficult test against Arsenal next week. 

Henderson played 30 times in the top-flight last season as Liverpool won their first ever Premier League title last season in comfortable fashion.
