The album has found success internationally too, reaching No. 7 on America's Billboard 200 chart and No. 5 in Canada. 

Meanwhile, the country crooner's new single with Pink, One Too Many, is shaping up to be a huge hit too.

It's already reached No. 6 in Australia and cracked the Billboard Hot 100. 

Keith and wife Nicole Kidman have been married for 14 years and are still going as strong as ever.

And in a recent interview with Stellar magazine, Keith said: 'I definitely married up. Isn't that what we're all supposed to be doing?'

The hitmaker said that one of the surprising impacts actress Nicole has had is on his country music career - by broadening his taste in music. 

He admits: 'Nic's definitely had a big impact on my music in the last five to six years particularly.

'She had different musical tastes than I did when we met. It really liberated me a lot, introduced me to a lot of music I'd missed.

'We also find huge common threads in the Aussie music we love, because we grew up at the same time.'

He said the main change she inspired is making him 'more fearless with my artistry... She's just very willing to try things; that's rubbed off on me.'
