A staffer for Donald Trump is under fire for mocking Joe Biden as he visited the graves of his late family members over the weekend. 

On Sunday Francis Brennan, Trump's campaign director of strategic response, slammed Biden for not speaking to media, as he walked through Brandywine church's cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware, where his late son Beau is buried along with his first wife Neilia and their daughter Naomi.

Brennan tweeted video of of Biden walking through the cemetery. A reporter is heard saying: 'Mr. Vice President come talk to us!' and Biden responds with a cheerful wave before walking along to pay his respects to his loved ones.

Brennan sarcastically captioned the video: 'Joe Biden just keeps meandering along.'

Beau Biden, the former Delaware attorney general and an Iraq veteran, died from brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46. Neila and Naomi Biden died in a car accident in 1972.

The incident came days after it was revealed the president allegedly refused to visit a war cemetery in Paris back in 2018 and said Americans who died in wars were 'losers' and 'suckers' – but Trump denies the report.

As Biden attended church and visited his loved ones, Trump spent Saturday and Sunday playing golf at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.

Brennan’s tweet was met with bitter backlash by Twitter users to said he was disrespecting Biden in his emotional visit to his family's graves. 

'He is visiting his son’s grave. Are you even human!!' Mia Farrow replied.

'Despicable you would even try to make this a story. He’s visiting his son’s grave and no one, with any humanity left in them, would expect him to make it into a PR event. It actually notches up my respect for him even more. Shame on you,' another Twitter user added.

'This is the Director of Strategic Response for the Trump campaign mocking Joe Biden for walking through the graveyard where his son is buried after leaving church this morning while Donald Trump spent his day on the golf course,' Andrew Weinstein, chair of the Democrats Lawyers’ Council said.

One user shared a video of Donald Trump actually meandering, walking around a lawn aimlessly avoiding reporters.

'Walking in a straight line is not meandering. Get a grip,' one Twitter user clapped back.

'Meandering, as one does while visiting one’s child’s grave. Where do they find little p****s like you, Francis?' another social media user added.

Biden's sentimental visit to his family's graves comes after news broke that the president allegedly refused to visit the graves of american war heroes in France in 2018. 

On Thursday the Atlantic reported that the president allegedly dismissed a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris, saying 'why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.'

Yo Francis, @FrancisBrennan is this meandering?https://t.co/9w23nFGWCh

He canceled the visit and blamed rain for the decision, saying the helicopter couldn’t fly and Secret Service couldn’t drive him there.

In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to more than 1,800 marines who died at Belleau Wood as 'suckers' for getting killed.

Trump denied ever saying those statements. 

'It’s a fake story and it’s a disgrace that they’re allowed to do it,' he told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday. 

'To me, they’re heroes. It’s even hard to believe how they could do it. And I say that, the level of bravery, and to me, they’re absolute heroes.'

On Friday Trump said that his former chief of staff John Kelly 'could have been' a source for those claims.

Four people with alleged knowledge of the cemetery incident claimed it happened to the magazine.

Trump has been heavily criticized for the shocking comments in the past that disrespect veterans and war heroes.

Former secretary of defense Chuck Hagel, a Republican, said the remarks are 'credible' due to Trump’s track record of denigrating military personnel.

He’s made audacious comments against former US defense secretary James Mattis and US Senator John McCain.
