Noel Gallagher has revealed he's refusing to sport face masks, despite UK's restrictions to minimise the spread of coronavirus.

Wearing a covering over your nose and mouth is mandatory by law in all shops, supermarkets and on public transport, with exemptions for people with medical conditions and children under 11.

During a new interview on The Matt Morgan podcast, the musician, 53, explained: 'Listen to me, it's not a law. There's too many f***** liberties being taken away from us now.'

The Oasis star recalled a time he requested to speak to a shop manager when an employee asked him to don a protective mask.

'I don't give a f**k. I choose not to wear one and if I get the virus it's on me, it's not on anyone else. If every other c***s wearing a mask I'm not gonna catch it off them, and If I've got it then they're not gonna catch it off me. I think it's a p***take', he said.

Last month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that repeatedly refusing to wear a face mask could lead to a fine of up to £3,200.

At present those who do not cover their faces can be ordered to pay a penalty of £100 – or £50 if they pay within a fortnight.

People caught without a mask for a second time will now face a fine of £200, with the amount doubling on every repeat offence to a maximum of £3,200. 

The rock star went on to reflect on another moment he refused to wear mask, explaining: 'I was going up to Manchester the other week and some guy's going 'can you put your mask on, because the transport police will get on and fine you a thousand pounds. But you don't have to put it on if you're eating.'

'So I was saying 'Oh right, this killer virus that's sweeping through the train is gonna come and attack me but see me having a sandwich and go leave him, he's having his lunch?''

A few weeks ago, his estranged brother Liam shared his thoughts on the topic as he tweeted: 'Don't like but it's gotta be done think it's a crime to hide this face.' (sic)

In a bid to curb the virus further, Boris introduced the 'six person rule' on Monday, meaning no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'. 

Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. 

In June, singer Liam, 47, revealed he postponed his wedding because he doesn't want to shield his face while saying his vows.

The rocker was due to marry his long-time girlfriend Debbie Gwyther in Italy over the summer.

He insisted in March that their big day would still be going ahead even when the country was in full lockdown.

Speaking to Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2, he said: 'It's been put back now until next year because I think we had to wear masks and stuff and I am not getting married with a mask on.'

The Wall Of Glass hitmaker proposed to Debbie whilst on holiday on the Amalfi Coast in August 2019
