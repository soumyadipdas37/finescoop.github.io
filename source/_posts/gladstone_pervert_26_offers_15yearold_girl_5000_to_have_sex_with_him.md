A pervert has avoided jail after offering an underage girl $5,000 to have sex with him.    

The 26-year-old man, from Queensland, began to message the 15-year-old girl on Instagram in May 2019 and told her she was 'beautiful' and 'could get anyone', Gladstone Magistrate's Court heard.

He then asked if she had Snapchat and told her he hated messaging on Instagram, where conversations can be recorded, the Gladstone Observer reported.

The man told the girl he really liked her in July 2019 and asked when she would be 'legal'.

The court heard how the teenager reported the man's behaviour to a school counsellor, who told police.

However, the man continued to message the teenager and requested to suck on her 'mint t****es' and 'eat her p***y'.

He offered her $100 to send him naked photographs and $5,000 to have sex with him.

Officers attended his home in May 2020 and he was arrested.

The man pleaded to grooming a child under 16 with intent to procure engagement in a sexual act on Wednesday.

Magistrate Ross Woodford said the man has a four-page long criminal history but he was unlikely to re-offend. 

He sentenced the man to nine months in prison - which was suspended for 18 months. 

'You are a low risk of re-offending due to the fact you have no like offences or sexual offences and your history is very limited,' Magistrate Woodford told the court.

'There was no intention to meet up with the child while the texting was going on and it appears to be an isolated incident.'
