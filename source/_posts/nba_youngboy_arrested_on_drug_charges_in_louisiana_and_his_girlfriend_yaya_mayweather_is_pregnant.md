YoungBoy Never Broke Again was arrested along with 15 others in his native Louisiana on Monday night on possession of schedule I drugs, manufacturing/distributing a schedule II drug, and manufacturing/distributing schedule IV drugs.

As of Tuesday morning, the 20-year-old Choppa City rapper (born Kentrell Gaulden) was still in custody at the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, according to Page Six.

'Kentrell is not guilty of any crimes,' his attorney James Manasseh said in a statement to WAFB9.Â

'There's nothing in the report that indicates that he did anything wrong. They arrested several people and there was no indication that he had any guns or drugs on him at the time of the arrest. I ultimately believe he will be found innocent in all of this.'

Manasseh told TMZ on Tuesday that police were conducting illegal searches and detainments on a firearms tip, and NBA YoungBoy was unarmed.Â 

NBA YoungBoy's arrest came as The Source discovered Iyanna 'Yaya' Mayweather was pregnant in a dancing TikTok video where her baby bump was prominently showing.

The hip-hop star and the expecting 20-year-old - who have both since deactivated their social media accounts - have been dating on and off over the last two years.

NBA YoungBoy is rumored to have fathered an eye-popping seven children with seven different women, but he only admitted to having five kids in July.

'I got four little boys, right,' he clarified via Instagram Live.

'And I got one daughter. Her name is Armani. Dude, I ain't got no other daughter. I got another daughter on the way though.'

Bad influence? And while the ninth grade drop-out has an extremely long rap sheet, Yaya was arrested April 4 in Houston for felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against one of his babymamas Lapattra Lashai Jacobs
