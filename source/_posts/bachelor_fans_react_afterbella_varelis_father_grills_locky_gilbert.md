While his daughter may have fallen head over heels for Locky Gilbert, Bella Varelis' father, Steve, made no secret of the fact he's not a fan of the reality star during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor.

Despite admitting he was nervous about meeting Bella's dad, the 31-year-old Bachelor immediately got him offside after he was busted kissing his daughter.

Things only went from bad to worse when the overprotective father pulled Locky aside for a one-on-one conversation. 

Getting off on the wrong foot: While his daughter may have fallen head over heels for Locky Gilbert (pictured), Bella Varelis' father, Steve, made no secret of the fact he's not a fan of the reality star during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor

'I'm the good old-fashioned Greek overprotective father. It only takes this much for you to be my best friend,' he began in a monologue to Locky. 

'You will have to prove yourself this much if you want to be in my daughter's life. So, I hope you've been respectful to my daughter. 

'It's definitely gonna take a bit more work than cooking me one meal to make me trust you. And when it concerns my daughter, all bets are off.

His harsh assessment of the Bachelor star left Locky sweating, with fans weighing in on their tense conversation.

'Bella's dad thinks he's the Godfather...' tweeted one viewer, while another wrote, 'Bella's dad is plotting the hit as we speak'.

'I've got you at a bit of a disadvantage because, I mean, I was an avid Survivor fan, so I know a lot about you. I was a fan. Now I'm not,' Steve told Locky

Added another: 'Bella's dad is giving off "I will break your arms and then bury you in a shallow grave using your own shattered hands to dig the hole" vibes'.

One viewer was curious about what Steve had found after he claimed he'd used his IT knowledge and background in online security to research Locky.

'What the hell did Bella's dad find when he hacked the mainframe to find the dirt on Lochy [sic]?' they asked.

'That he strangles cats? That he charges $9.99 on OnlyFans for pics of his 3rd nipple? That he DOESN'T like Nissan or Starbucks or Magnum ice cream after all???'

Another viewer thought Steve had earned himself a place on the next season of Bachelor in Paradise. 

'Can we get Bella's dad, the self-professed "human lie detector" in the next season of Paradise as the couples expert?' asked one fan. 

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
