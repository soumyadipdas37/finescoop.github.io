A doctor has appeared in court accused of a string of sexual assaults against a member of staff at a busy London hospital.

Dr Kabir Sandhu, 29, allegedly sexually assaulted the member of staff while working at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, in central London.

He is accused of repeatedly grabbed the complainant's breasts and bottom and of grabbing her around the throat with 'some pressure'.    

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard today that he is accused of kissing the alleged victim and rubbing his crotch against her. 

Dr Sandhu carried out one assault in the A&E department of the hospital on 1 December, 2018, and a further five on 2 February last year, it was said.  

The doctor, who is currently working as GP at a practice in West Hampstead, appeared in court today and denied all the allegations. 

The complainant also alleges Dr Sandhu, of Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, put his hand under her clothes and into her bra, prosecutor Jonathan Bryan said.

He also allegedly rubbed himself against the woman and said 'can you feel that?', Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

Mr Bryan said the first allegation involved the doctor grabbing the woman's breast over her clothing.

He added: 'Then on 2 February a whole series of incidents also took place in the Accident and Emergency department.

'There is grabbing of her breasts, kissing her.' 

District Judge Nina Tempia granted the doctor bail on condition he does not contact the alleged victim directly or indirectly. 

He was bailed ahead of a plea and trial preparation hearing at Southwark Crown Court on 5 October.
