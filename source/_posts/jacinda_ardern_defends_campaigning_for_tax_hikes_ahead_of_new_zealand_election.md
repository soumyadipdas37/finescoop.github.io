Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says she's undaunted by campaigning for tax hikes as the opposition pledges tax cuts as voting begins in New Zealand's election.

Ms Ardern ramped up for the October 17 election with a string of interviews with Australian TV outlets on Tuesday morning, the same day that overseas and disabled Kiwis can begin to return ballots.

Speaking to Australian Associated Press, Ms Ardern said her pitch to Australian-based Kiwis would be the same as locals.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says she's undaunted by campaigning for tax hikes as the opposition pledges tax cuts as voting begins in New Zealand's election

'It will still be about the future,' she said.

'This election is in the midst of such an uncertain environment. And so, my very clear pitch will be in the midst of that uncertainty, we need that stability.

'We need a very strong plan ... and it's a plan that I do think also will create a better New Zealand in the aftermath.'

Though voting is non-compulsory, more than 50,000 Australian-based Kiwis are expected to return ballots, mostly through a download-upload voting system at vote.nz.

Ms Ardern said she remained a student of Australian politics, but said 'there was a period where I watched more so than I do now, with simply the amount of time I have'.

The 40-year-old has a commanding lead in the polls and her Labour party may even come the first party to govern in majority since electoral reform in 1996.

For weeks the Labour party was on course to govern alone, but a poll released on Monday by TVNZ and research firm Colmar Brunton showed support for Ms Ardern had dropped to 47 per cent.

While it has only dropped one per cent since the last poll on September 22, the level of support means Labour would procure 59 seats rather than the 61 needed to form a majority government.Â 

Ms Ardern said she watched the Australian Labor party slump to a surprising defeat last year as it tried to make an argument for tax reform, spun by opponents as a 'death tax'.

In New Zealand, the opposition National party is mounting a major attack on tax, announcing a temporary tax cut that would see average full-time workers around $NZ2500 ($A2300) better off next year.

In contrast, with an eye to ballooning debt, Ms Ardern's party is promising to lift taxes on income earned over $NZ180,000 ($A166,000) - the top two per cent of Kiwis.

Ms Ardern said she didn't need to learn from Australian Labor's 2019 loss as 'I probably reflect the most on my own experiences and those losses. And I've had a few of those'.

The now-popular prime minister spent nine years in opposition and lost three races for an electorate seat, entering parliament through a backdoor route unique to NZ politics before winning a safe seat in 2017.

Ms Ardern said COVID-19 had changed the electoral environment and Kiwis would see tax cuts as reckless.

'The pandemic just changes everything about an election,' she said.

'It does make it an entirely different environment where people are looking and saying, genuinely casting above their own personal interest.

'They're saying, 'Is this something that we, as a whole team of five million, is this the right time (for tax cuts) or is this an irresponsible call right now we're in the middle of pandemic'.

'I actually do think that's the lens that people are looking at these policies.'
