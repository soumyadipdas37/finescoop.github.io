Scott Morrison has asked Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to let a grieving daughter attend her father's funeral. 

Sarah Caisip, who lives in Canberra, is in hotel quarantine in Brisbane after getting an exemption to enter Queensland to visit her father who was dying of cancer.

But the exemption took 20 days to be granted and Miss Caisip's father died two days before she got there.

Now the 26-year-old is asking to attend the funeral today but officials have told her she is a Covid-19 risk and must go back to Canberra.

Queensland's borders are closed to the ACT even though it has not had a single case of coronavirus for two months. 

Mr Morrison said has called the premier and asked her to show some compassion. 

'Surely in the midst of all of this heartache, surely just this once it can be done,' he told radio 2GB.

In the Queensland parliament today, Ms Palaszczuk accused the prime minister of 'bullying her'.

She said: 'I won't be bullied nor will I be intimidated by the prime minister of this country who contacted me this morning, and who I made very clear to the fact, that this is not my decision. 

'I passed this onto the chief health officer, and it is the chief health officer's decision to make.' 

Mr Morrison strongly rejected any accusation of bullying.

He said: 'I have appealed to her to overturn the decision and allow Sarah to go to the funeral today.

'It's not about borders, it's not about federation, it's not about elections. The only that matters today is that Sarah can be with her family to mourn the passing of her father Bernard.

'This is a heartbreaking case.'

The Prime Minister said he also spoken to Sarah to '
