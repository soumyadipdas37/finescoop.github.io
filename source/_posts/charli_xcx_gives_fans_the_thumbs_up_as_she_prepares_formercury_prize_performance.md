Charli XCX gave fans the thumbs up on Wednesday morning as she prepared for her imminent performance at the 2020 Hyandai Mercury Prize Albums Of The Year.   

The singer has received a nomination at the forthcoming event, which will take place virtually in accordance with current safety measures, following the release of lockdown album How I'm Feeling Now in May. 

And she was looking ahead to putting on a show after taking to Instagram with a cheerful selfie that appeared to be taken as she readied herself at home in Los Angeles.

The singer won critical and commercial acclaim following the release of How I'm Feeling Now, an album inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and written and recorded during a creatively frenetic six-week period.

Other artists to feature among this year's Mercury Music Prize nominees include Dua Lipa, Stormzy, Kano and Laura Marling.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that Charli obtained a temporary restraining order against an allegedly obsessed fan who broke into her Los Angeles home and removed his clothes. 

The English singer claimed the Wisconsin man tried to visit her twice, and during his second trip stripped down, jumped in her hot tub and strolled around her bedroom, according to an article by TMZ.

Charli, in her filing seeking the court order, claimed the man has sent her hundreds of disturbing messages on social media.  

He allegedly went to her Los Angeles home on August 24 and 25 with security footage capturing him on video.

Charli was not at home when the man allegedly broke in, according to court documents.

The temporary restraining order requires the man to stay at least 100 yards away from the singer, her car, her job and her home.

The court-ordered protection was granted as Charli put her 1920s home in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles up for sale.
