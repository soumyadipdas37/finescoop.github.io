Brie Larson shared rare public photos with her and boyfriend Elijah Allan-Blitz, during a live-streamed Wired interview to promote their VR project The Messy Truth.

Larson, 30, and Allan-Blitz, 32, headlined the opening night festivities for The Wired 25, a virtual conference by Wired Magazine held every year. 

The Captain Marvel star took to Twitter on Thursday afternoon to share the new photos of her and Allan-Blitz, who started dating in August 2019, while speaking about their episode of The Messy Truth which Allan-Blitz directed.

The happy couple were all smiles in the photos, with Brie nuzzling close to his face in one of the four photos.

'Just two professional people who would love your support of our project The Messy Truth,' Larson began in her tweet.

'More importantly, we would love your support in expanding our compassion for one another - whatever that looks like for you!' she added.

In a second tweet, she shared the Wired link to the interview she and Allan-Blitz did with Van Jones and Wired's Angela Watercutter.

Jones spearheaded The Messy Truth: The VR Experience, that was spawned from Jones' 2017 book Beyond the Messy Truth: How We Came Apart, How We Come Together.

The project puts users in situations they would normally not find themselves in, with the first episode featuring Black Panther star Winston Duke, giving viewers a glimpse of what it's like to be a Black man being pulled over by the police.

Larson has a role in the second episode, which puts viewers in the perspective of a woman being sexually harassed. 

'What we’re talking about is trying to put someone in someone else’s shoes,' Larson said in the interview.

'One place this really excels is dealing with power imbalance, because it’s an experience that’s very hard to have if your body limits you and you’ve never been in that experience before,' she added.

She said that they started speaking with a bunch of women in the restaurant industry and 'started collecting a bunch of stories.'

'It's important, I think, to say that this project is their true stories, so when you're going inside these experiences, we're not fictionalizing it. We're just telling the truth and letting you go in and feel it for yourself,' Larson added. 

Allan-Blitz revealed that less than a week after the election of Donald Trump, he spoke with Jones about doing something with VR technology.

'We need to see if we can use the power of this technology to actually, instead of dividing us like we've seen over the past four years, to bring us together,' Allan-Blitz said.

'This is a social experiment. We’re trying to see if we can use this new medium of VR to actually put you in the shoes of someone else, where you look down and you’re fully embodied in these different experiences, and to really see if this can be the ultimate empathy machine,' he added.

Larson added that one of the first conversations she had with Allan-Blitz was about empathy, and when he mentioned this project, she was 'in the midst of working with Times Up.'

“There are infinite stories to tell.” Larson said. “As many people as there are on the planet, everybody has a story, everybody has a moment that should be shared and experienced. And so we’re excited to collect more and do more.”
