She is one of the most popular stars to come out of Married At First Sight.

And on Saturday, Martha Kalifatidis put on an eye-popping display as she flaunted her cleavage while she posed for a series of photos.

The 31-year-old reality star revealed it was 'love at first bite,' in the caption alongside the Instagram post.

'Love at First Bite!' Reality star Martha Kalifatidis (pictured) put on an eye-popping display as she flaunted her cleavage while eating an ice-cream on Saturday

Dressed a plaid crop top with puff sleeves, and denim jeans Martha appeared to be relaxed as she posed with the Magnum Ruby flavoured ice-cream.

She wore her blonde messy tresses pushed back behind her head, and let her fringe hang for the occasion.

Martha was paired with schoolteacher Michael Brunelli on MAFS last year and the pair have remained together since.

Busy girl: Martha has launched a new career as a brand ambassador and social media influencer

Since starring on the 2019 season, Martha has launched a new career as a brand ambassador and social media influencer. 

Last month Martha ensured all eyes were on her yet again when she posted a steamy naked selfie. 

The beauty blogger flaunted her incredible curves while posing in front of her bathroom mirror after getting out of the shower. 

Is this her raciest post yet? Last month Martha surprised her fans as she flaunted her sensational curves as she went completely naked after a steamy shower 

Martha ensured her ample cleavage was covered by steam, while her newly blonde hair sat soaking wet on her shoulders.

The reality star shot the mirror a sultry look and wrote in the caption: 'Dat fresh fresh feelin.' 

Martha is certainly no stranger to racy photographs, but she is often forced to hit back at criticism from fans.
