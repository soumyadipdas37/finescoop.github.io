She delightedly announced she was expecting her second child with Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson last week.

But for now, pregnant Laura Byrne's attention was well and truly centred on her sweet one-year-old daughter Marlie-Mae as the pair enjoyed an adorable conversation together.

In a clip shared to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, the youngster impressively relayed words such as 'pasta', 'thank you' and 'hello' as she splashed around in the bathtub.

Cute! Pregnant Laura Byrne's attention was well and truly centred on her sweet one-year-old daughter Marlie-Mae as the pair enjoyed an adorable conversation together

The youngster was evidently in the mood to chat up a storm as she sweetly obeyed her mother's orders. 

The only word little Marlie appeared to have a tough time saying was 'yes' as she kept telling her amused mother 'no' instead.  

Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Laura openly discussed the 'weird' side of her second pregnancy during an extremely candid confession on her podcast, Life Uncut.

After stating she didn't want to focus on the 'glossy' side of being pregnant, the 31-year-old boldly told co-host Brittany Hockley: 'Your vagina starts getting fat and your nipples turn black... and why is there a beard growing on my stomach?'

She laughed: 'Pregnancy does the weirdest s**t to your body. All this weird stuff happens, and nobody talks about it!'

The reality star, who is 21 weeks pregnant, also claimed her nipples have 'grown really long', before describing to Brittany what she's expecting her private parts to look like when she hits the nine-month mark.

'Mine doesn't look like it yet, but lo and behold at nine months some people get a really swollen vagina,' she laughed. 'It looks like a chicken breast. Just think of a really juicy chicken breast.'
