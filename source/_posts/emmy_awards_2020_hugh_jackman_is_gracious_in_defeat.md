Hugh Jackman has long been considered the 'Nicest Guy in Hollywood'.

And the 51-year-old Australian actor lived up to his reputation on Sunday, during the first-ever virtual Emmy Awards ceremony.

In a live stream from his New York home, Hugh pumped his fist in the air and cheered on Mark Ruffalo, after losing out to the American actor in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie Category. 

Emmy Awards 2020: 'The Nicest Guy in Hollywood' Hugh Jackman (pictured with wife Deborra-Lee Furness) was gracious in defeat as he lost to Mark Ruffalo for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie Category on Sunday 

Hugh, who appeared on screen alongside wife Deborra-Lee Furness, was nominated for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in HBO's drama Bad Education.

As it was announced Mark, 52, had won the category for his portrayal of brothers Dominick and Thomas Birdsey in TV mini-series I Know This Much Is True, Hugh was gracious in defeat.

Hugh plays Frank Tassone in the HBO drama Bad Education, which also airs on Foxtel in Australia.

Frank hoodwinked Long Island's Roslyn High School, conning his way to millions to fund his extravagant lifestyle, before being sent to prison in 2006 for larceny.  

Hugh's performance quickly received rave reviews, with USA TODAY branding it 'great acting', while Decider called it an 'Oscar-worthy role'.

In an interview with Variety in April, Hugh described the opportunity to portray the real-life school superintendent as 'fascinating'.    

'The role itself was something different from what I've done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community - and fell down this slippery path,' he said. 

Hugh also described playing the villain as 'delicious' in an interview with Collider.

'As an actor, it just had so much to play with, and so many things that I've never really had the opportunity to play with. He's seemingly very charming, but also just a viper... Those things, I just found really exciting to play,' he said.
