Cat Cavelli has given birth to a baby boy called Jax with rumoured love Chelsea footballer Jorginho Frello.

The Voice singer, 30, announced she was pregnant on Mother's Day in March, however she didn't name the babies' father in her Instagram post.

Cat - whose real name is Catherine Harding - already shares her five-year-old daughter Ada with her ex-boyfriend Jude Law.    

Baby number two: Shortly after she announced her pregnancy, it was reported that Cat was expecting her second child with Chelsea footballer Jorginho Frello, 28

Shortly after Cat announced her pregnancy in March, it was reported that she was expecting her second child with Chelsea footballer Jorginho Frello, 28.

The singer is thought to have struck up a romance with Jorginho following the breakdown of his marriage to Natalia Leteri, reports the Sun.

Jorginho shares two children, Vitor and Alicia, with his estranged wife, who he is thought to have secretly separated from at some point last year.

The couple were together for eight years and tied the knot in 2017.

A source told the website: 'Cat fell hard for him and has struggled to keep their romance a secret. It became known to her circle of friends, the music industry and — through her role on The Voice — backstage on TV. 

'She told Jorginho she was pregnant just before her announcement. He was delighted and she's looking forward to becoming a mother for the second time.'

MailOnline contacted Cat and Jorginho for further comment at the time.

Cat - who revealed to MailOnline in February that she had moved on with a new boyfriend - took to Instagram in March to announce that she was expecting her first child with her new beau.

Posting a sweet snap of daughter Ada holding her baby bump, Cat shared: 'I am so grateful to be blessed with the most powerful gift of life.'

As well as her adorable bump shot, Cat uploaded a series of throwback photographs of Ava as a newborn, including a shot of her mother holding the sweet child.

In a lengthy caption alongside the photograph, she wrote: 'Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful mother's around the world giving unconditional love everyday even when they are tired...

'Stressed or dealing with whatever problems they may have in their lives but always make their children priority. You are amazing!!

'Five years ago on Mother's Day 2015 my beautiful daughter was born and now in a time of such sadness and pain in the world, when we realise how fragile life can be I am so grateful to be blessed with the most powerful gift of life. 

A case of the ex: Cat shares daughter Ada with shares with Hollywood star Jude Law, 47 (Pictured in February)

Cute! Cat was 23 when she dated Ada's father Jude, then 41, who was filming on location in the Czech Republic 

'And can't forget my mummy who is always there for me no matter what you are an angel (even though you drive me mad) hahaha #happymothersday #grateful #blessed #secondpregnancy.'  

Cat was 23 when she dated Jude, then 41, who was filming on location in the Czech Republic as he grew close to the aspiring musician. 

Jude is also a father to Rafferty, 23, Iris, 19, and Rudy, 17, from his marriage to actress Sadie Frost, 54, who he met when the pair starred together in 1992 film Shopping. 

The star, famed for his roles in Captain Marvel, The Holiday and Alfie, shares 10-year-old Sophia with model Samantha Burke and his youngest Ada with The Voice contestant.

Cat told MailOnline earlier this year how her new relationship inspired her to write fresh material – almost five years after she became a mum to Ada, who she shares with the Hollywood actor.

Singer-songwriter Cat said her daughter hopes to follow in her footsteps by competing in the next series of The Voice Kids and she believes Ada could go all the way as she can already 'stay in tune and hit high notes.'

Cat said: 'I definitely write a lot of love songs, especially last year. 

'I find I go through phases when I have inspiration and other times not but last year I entered into a new relationship and that definitely gave me loads of creativity and inspiration. 

'My songs are usually based on love – boring! It inspires me so much, there's no other feeling like it.'

Priorities: Cat gave up her dreams of becoming a singer when she fell pregnant with Ada

Speaking about her daughter Ada, she said: 'She's already said she wants to go on The Voice Kids. 

'She's watched YouTube clips of the kids and asks if she's a better singer and I tell her she's amazing but say, 'She's probably had more practice than you, you really need to practice.' 

'I don't want to be a pushy stage mum but she definitely veers very much towards acting and singing, that's for sure. 

'It's always amazing to see your child do something that they really love and see them sparkle. Obviously because I sing it's sweet because she's like me, my little mini me.' 

Cat gave up her dreams of becoming a singer when she fell pregnant with Ada – and after she suffered a damaging knock to her confidence. 

But The Voice has given her the chance to build back her self-esteem, with Cat saying: 'I feel like I've started afresh and I'm completely back to myself.' 

She said: 'I moved to London when I was 18 to do music and I was writing a lot and performing in a band but then I stopped when I had my daughter. 

'I wanted to take a backseat. There was some stuff that happened which really knocked my confidence.

'I wasn't in the best place so concentrated on being a mother and then I tried thinking, maybe I'll go back and do something else, study but that wasn't for me.

'So I started doing music again and I put together my own show. When The Voice came along I thought I'm just going to go for it. Why not? It's really putting yourself out there. 

'I feel better than before. I feel less nervous and I'm just going for it whatever happens, which I didn't do when I was younger.'

Cat was being mentored on The Voice by coach Olly Murs, 35, who fell for her husky tones during the blind auditions.

And Cat admitted that she chose to work with Olly over rival coach Will.i.am (who also turned for her) because his flirtatiousness put her at ease.

She said: 'I did feel a slight flirtation with Olly. He's quite the cheeky chappy. And I'm probably a bit of a flirt – joking, not joking! He's lovely, I feel comfortable.

'Although both Will and Olly turned I felt more of a connection to Olly. I felt like I got along with him more or connected to him more. You just get a feeling don't you?

'It's amazing working with Olly. He's super passionate about the show and really supportive. He likes to get involved, you can ask him whatever. He's more hands on than you would imagine...'
