With her blonde tresses swept into loose waves, Arabella showcased her model credentials as she posed on a balcony overlooking the stunning backdrop. 

The reality star accentuated her bronzed complexion with a dash of highlighter over her cheekbones and a natural lip to keep all eyes on her incredible figure. 

Emphasising her hourglass curves, Arabella pulled her lacy thong high up onto her hips and drew attention to her washboard abs.

The pair had been dating for nine months but were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their split.

The hunk left the home he shared with Arabella so they didn't have to isolate together under lockdown rules. He is now living with his friend and former Love Island 2018 co-star, Josh Denzel.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'It's all over. They started to grow apart. They want to remain civil with each other and hope to remain friends.'
