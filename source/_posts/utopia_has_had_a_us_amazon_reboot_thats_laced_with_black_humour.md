Melting icecaps. Raging fires. Political unrest. And a mysterious flu-like virus that threatens to ravage humanity. 

No, this isn't just another day in 2020. It's the world of Utopia, a British fantasy sci-fi thriller that first aired on Channel 4 seven years ago, in which a cult comic book predicts real-life disasters – some eerily familiar. 

Now the show has been relocated to America for a remake on Amazon Prime.

It couldn't begin more innocently. Under clear blue skies in suburbia, a wholesome young couple excitedly move into a house left to the woman by her late grandfather.

The house is full of clutter, and among it they find the drafts for an unpublished comic book, Utopia, which they decide to sell at comic book festival Fringecom.

But here the eight-part tale takes a dark turn. Utopia isn't just a comic: it's the eagerly awaited sequel to Dystopia, a graphic horror novel about a world turned into chaos by supervillain Mr Rabbit. 

Among the usual comic book obsessives at Fringecom are four young people who see Dystopia as a grim warning for the future. 

They believe Utopia, if they can find it, is the guide map to salvation. 

Meanwhile, two strangers who will stop at nothing to obtain Utopia for their own sinister purposes arrive at Fringecom too...

'I love the world of comic books,' says Gillian Flynn, the author of 2012 bestseller Gone Girl who has loosely adapted the new series from the original.

'My dad collected them. We'd drive around garage sales and flea markets for them, so I've always had that fire.'

The original Utopia, created by Dennis Kelly, whose new show The Third Day is now on Sky Atlantic, was a cult phenomenon, admired for its smart storytelling yet condemned for sometimes excessive violence. 

Due to budget issues, the American version has taken seven years to come to screens, after being dropped by HBO and Fight Club's David Fincher leaving as director.

In an eerie twist, one prophecy of Dystopia – a deadly pandemic – has gone from fantasy to grim reality just as the new show comes out. 

'When we were trying to sell it, the concern was that this part isn't believable,' says Gillian. 

'People were saying, "These things aren't happening, it's a chance in a million."

'So of all the moments to have it happen. We'd just finished filming in late February and I was editing it when these notices started coming up on TV. It's very strange.'

Gillian actually started writing her version while the British one was still airing. 

'We were filming Gone Girl,' she says of the movie of her psychological thriller starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, which was directed by David Fincher. 

'David sent me a text saying, "I think we've got our next project – call me."

'I hadn't seen the show, but then I watched it. Dennis had created such an amazing world that I thought, "Will there be anything new to say about this?" 

'But when I looked at it all through my own lens I did find a story to write.'

The first change Gillian made was altering the look from Dennis's stylised, slightly tongue-in-cheek visuals to make it grittier and more realistic. 

'He had this chirpy Britpop sensibility that we Americans could not pull off if we tried – lots of bright colours and more explosive violence. 

'My goal was to give it almost a lack of style. I wanted this world to feel real. I felt the more we could tamp it down into the real world, the scarier it would be.'

She also toned down the violence. 'There are moments here and there, certainly at the start as I wanted to establish that this is a dangerous world. 

'But there's much more implied violence. I find that scarier – to me, it's scarier when you can't see the shark in Jaws than when you can.'

One element she did keep was the show's distinctive dark humour that, in true British style, underlies some of its bleakest moments. 

'I didn't particularly use British or American humour, I used what would make me laugh. 

'The actors are very funny, and it was a treat to see them breathe life into the words – until then it had been my husband and me on the couch reading aloud and they weren't funny at all!'

The new trailer follows a similar plot line to the original series, starting with a group of geeks meeting at a comic book convention. Pictured, Jessica Rothe as Samantha 

Relative unknowns Dan Byrd, Jessica Rothe, Ashleigh LaThrop and Desmin Borges play the young crusaders Ian, Samantha, Becky and Wilson, respectively. 

John Cusack, the star of Grosse Pointe Blank, plays Dr Kevin Christie, an entrepreneur and philanthropist. 

'He's one of those mega-billionaires with foundations,' says John, 54. 'He's very powerful and committed to staving off the extinction of the planet.'

But Dr Christie – loosely based on sinister versions of the Elon Musks and Bill Gates of this world – may not be so virtuous. 

'We are critical of the notion of benevolent billionaires – when you look behind the curtains, maybe they're not as benevolent as they seem.'

John has not seen the British series. 'I didn't want to think about it while we made our show. But I hear people love it – and it's controversial. 

'I'm not surprised, Gillian doesn't shy away from stuff.' 

Utopia will be on Amazon Prime from Friday.
