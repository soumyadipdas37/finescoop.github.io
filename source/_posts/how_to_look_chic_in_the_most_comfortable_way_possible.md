COVID-19 has directly affected spring 2021's sartorial landscape.

From contemporary brands to high-end labels, designers (including Tom Ford!) have embraced these unprecedented times by addressing our quarantine needs. 

We saw luxe loungewear, stylish sweatsuits and cozy knit separates on the runways in New York, Milan and Paris this month. But you don't have to wait until next season to look and feel your best while WFH. Wolf & Badger's Creative Director & Co-Founder, Henry Graham, reveals how you can get the look now.

In the moment: COVID-19 has directly affected spring 2021's sartorial landscape. From contemporary brands to high-end labels, designers (Tom Ford included!) have embraced these unprecedented times by addressing our quarantine needs

Cozy chic: We saw luxe loungewear, stylish sweatsuits and cozy knit separates come down almost all the runways in New York, Milan and Paris this month

The most surprising trend this season is 'pared down simplicity and elegance,' according to Wolf & Badger's Creative Director & Co-Founder, Henry Graham

Relaxed suiting: By now we've all learned that working from home effectively takes practice, discipline and the right outfit

After many months of being in lockdown to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, we've all learned that working from home effectively takes practice and discipline. 

The most productive people don't roll out of bed and head straight to the computer in their pjs. They start their day by getting dressed in presentable clothes. 

The good news is that loungewear for spring has come a long way so you can look great while still being comfortable in your makeshift home office.

And professional workwear, including pantsuits and blazers (as seen at Boss) have become less formal and more relaxed.  

'Dressing up is as important now than ever,' said Henry. To look chic in the most easygoing way possible, Henry recommends sleepwear from Not Just Pajama.  

Founded in London 2015 the brand creates luxurious silk sets that are as fashionable for indoor/outdoor wear as they are comfortable. 

From the sheets to the streets: 'Dressing up is as important now than ever,' said Henry. 'Loungewear has done really well for us.' Henry recommends sleepwear from Not Just Pajama

'Pared down simplicity and elegance,' is the most surprising trend this season said the expert. 'It works super well when transitioning from home to work or play.'

In addition to fabulous pajamas, Henry recommends 'knits in beautiful soft yarns.'

Boss, N21 and Drome styled silky pajama separates with knitwear at their spring 2021 presentations.

Henry suggests oversized styles to carry out the comfy cozy feel. 

Working with designers from all over the world, Wolf & Badger is often ahead of the trends. 

'We have lots of amazing, neutral toned pieces made using luxe fabrics and subtle shapes. This season is going to be all about understated elegance.'

As clothing becomes more relaxed and effortless, so is footwear. 

'Mules are really trending right now, as are slip-ons,' shared Henry. 'They both work well for that casual, dressed-up look for a chic walk to the shops.' 

For style and versatility he favors Osay the label, Bala Di Gala and Atelier de Charlotte. 

Designers in every category are forging ahead with practicality at the forefront. Handbag brands are saying bye-bye to mini bags in favor of oversized carryalls that carry ALL. 

'I'm a huge fan of Kartu Studio,' revealed Henry.

To pull it all together, don't forget jewelry! A pair of statement earrings can turn a silk robe or casual two-piece set from meh to amazing! 

The must-have accessory for fall is of course the face mask. It's important to find a style that fits properly, is effective and suits your look.

Wolf & Badger has a wide selection of protective coverings from brands like Jessica Zoa, Adelina Rusu and NY Charisma.

With their finger on the pulse of what's hot, 'Wolf & Badger designers are selected based on their innovation of design, finish and quality of workmanship,' shared Henry.

'We also focus on brands that share our ethos of ethical and sustainable production.'

Polish brand AGGI offers and array of unique pieces (including face masks, cocktail dresses and tailored blazers) at affordable price points.   

 Babaloo jewelry celebrates women. Each piece is meant to evoke confidence and make the wearer feel as unique and wonderful as they are.  

For the girl who likes to stand out (in and out of quarantine), Paloma Lira Studio is the answer.

The brand was established in 2012 with the cultural and social changes of 60's, 70's and  80's and its influence nowadays as its muse. 

Established in 2016 True Decadence's  philosophy is centered around creating occasion wear in effortless silhouettes that celebrate femininity. 

With small at-home gatherings being more popular than ever, True Decadence designs scream hostess with the mostest!
