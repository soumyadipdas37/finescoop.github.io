Amazon has been slammed for selling racist caps with the slogan 'Black Lives Don't Matter' - marketed as 'elegant' and a 'nice present'. 

The offensive headgear was spotted by barrister Alexandra Wilson, who tweeted: 'This is not ok. @Amazon why is this racist hat being sold on your site? Are there no checks in place? This is honestly embarrassing.' 

The online retail giant later removed the £12.96 caps, which were sold by a third party seller. 



The offensive headgear was spotted by barrister Alexandra Wilson, who tweeted: 'This is not ok. @Amazon why is this racist hat being sold on your site? Are there no checks in place? This is honestly embarrassing.

A description, written by the seller, said the items were 'high quality' with a 'unique and fashionable' design that made them a 'nice present for family and friends'. 

Ms Wilson, 25, tweeted after the caps were removed: 'The largest online company sold caps telling us that "Black Lives Don’t Matter". 

'We spoke up and it’s finally gone. The power of social media. Imagine if the big companies and celebrities who posted a black square on social media used their platform to let activists speak? 

'Thank you to everyone who contacted Amazon directly. These small actions make a big difference. No one should ever have to see anything like this.'

Last month Amazon was called out by the actress Sally Phillips for selling T-shirts bearing slogans including 'Let's make Down Syndrome [sic] extinct'. 

The actress, 51, who lives in London, has three children, the oldest of which, Olly, 16, has Down's syndrome.

She described the offensive tops - which feature slogans including 'F*** Down's syndrome' - as 'hatewear' that demonstrate eugenic ideas 'are really taking hold'.  

Amazon said, in reference to the racist hats: 'All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. 

'The product in question is no longer available.'
