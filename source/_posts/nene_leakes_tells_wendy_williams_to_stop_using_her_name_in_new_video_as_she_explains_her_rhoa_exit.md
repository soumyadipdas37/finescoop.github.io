Nene Leakes is cutting ties with Wendy Williams, after the talk show host discussed her former pal's departure from Real Housewives of Atlanta with Andy Cohen. 

The 52-year-old reality star, who went on an fiery Twitter tirade against both Cohen and Williams after Sunday's Watch What Happens Live episode, uploaded a video to YouTube about their feud and her exit from Bravo's hit reality show.

While beginning the seven-minute recording by thanking her longtime fans, the  entrepreneur admitted leaving RHOA after 12 years was 'not an easy decision.'

Then, she spoke about not having 'a friend' that knows what she has been 'going through lately that would do this kind of thing' to her. 

At first, the mother-of-two said she understood William's commentary on her talk show, but felt her appearance on the WWHL was unnecessary and mean-spirited.   

'She does Andy Cohen's show and, here, she sits speaking negatively of my exit and bringing my family into the equation,' Leakes said of her pal's betrayal.

Speaking directly to Williams in the footage, she added: 'Now that's what you're not gonna do, Wendy.'

Additionally, Leakes asked Cohen to cease saying anything that isn't 'positive' after maintaining a professional relationship for more than a decade.  

'Stop bringing up my name on your show to help your ratings,' Leakes continued. 'You didn't want me here. You've been forcing me out for the last four years.'

She remarked: 'There's no reason why you need to keep bringing me up and talking so negatively of me.'  

'If I don't mean sh*t to you... stop bringing up my name. Leave me alone, let me leave in peace. Leave me alone,' she plead.  

Addressing Williams and Cohen, she slammed them of 'poking the bear over and over again.'

'Stop bringing up my name on your show to help your ratings,' Leakes said, addressing Cohen. 'You didn't want me here. You've been forcing me out for the last four years' 

'If I don't mean sh*t to you... stop bringing up my name. Leave me alone, let me leave in peace. Leave me alone,' she plead of both Williams and Cohen

Leakes was specifically referring to Williams' comments saying she had 'quit the show several times' before and 'likes dramatic attention.' 

Williams also harshly said any potential spin-offs revolving around Nene's life would be 'boring.'

She asked: 'Is it going to be Nene being a grandmother? That's boring. Nene and her own kids? That's boring. Nene trying to figure out Hollywood? That's boring.'

Shortly after WWHL aired, Leakes, while not directly naming Cohen or Williams, lashed out on Twitter, seemingly calling Williams a 'cocaine head' and Cohen a 'racist.' 

She began, 'Both are f their ratings are LOW! Bye QUEENS,'

In her next tweet she appeared to take aim at Williams, writing, 'She on cocaine so they should stop using her to talk! They both need my help with their poor ratings.' 

Ask them: Leakes questioned why she was never offered the same amount of episodes as her white counterparts

Systemic racism: Leakes signed off hinting that there is more to reveal

Leakes then seemed to target her former boss, Cohen, 'Keep trying me sir and imma let the world know who you really are. 

The mother-of-two also felt the need to defend her financial status, following Williams' comments, 'I will ALWAYS eat and eat good! Believe that. I have ALWAYS believed in multiple streams of income so the Leakes are good you ole cocaine head and you ole racist.

'No one knew you until YOU knew me. Remember I’m ICON. Don’t forget.' she continued.

Williams' has never shied away from talking about her past struggles with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction. In 2014 she told People: 'Drugs were a demon I had to overcome.' 

Just last September, Leakes affectionately referred to the NYT best-selling author as the 'match to my fire, the chips to my salsa and the ice cream to my cake' on social media. 

Now, it appears her 'close' friendship with the host is damaged beyond repair, and she wants nothing to do with Cohen, who she is 'publicly' pleaing to leave her alone. 

Nene first announced that she was done with the Real Housewives Of Atlanta in a YouTube video on September 17, after undergoing 'exhausting' and 'emotional negotiations with the network.
