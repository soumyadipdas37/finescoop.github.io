Inter boss Antonio Conte wants a reunion with Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, reports claim. 

The Italian lured Kante away from Premier League winners Leicester when he was Chelsea boss in 2016.

And according to Tuttomercatoweb, Conte wants to recruit the 29-year-old midfielder again with Inter keen to sign him on loan with a view to a permanent €50million (£44.5m) move.

Chelsea are seeking to raise funds for two more signings after splashing out on Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva. 

Kante is keen to add a sixth Premier League player to his squad.

He last year signed Romelu Lukaku, Christian Eriksen, Ashley Young, Victor Moses and Alexis Sanchez. 

And the move has seen Inter drop their interest in Sandro Tonali, opening the door for the Brescia midfielder to join Milan instead.

They also need to sell in order to raise funds, with exits for the likes of Roberto Gagliardini, Matias Vecino, Marcelo Brozovic and Eriksen.
