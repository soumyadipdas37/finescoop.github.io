DON’T PUT FLORALS AWAY

Knowing what to wear is as confusing as everything else right now. One minute, we have a blast of late summer sunshine, the next we’ve turned on our heating.

It’s too soon to wear black tights, yet doing the school run in a flimsy dress left me shivering. The solution is mixing and matching fabrics until the weather makes its mind up. Pattern-wise the temptation is to pack your florals away. But, worn the right way, they can be just the thing for easy autumnal style.

FEEL-GOOD FLOWERS

Designers showed their autumn collections back in the spring, in the final days before lockdown. 

Some, such as Richard Quinn and Erdem, captured the mood with muted but still cheery, floral designs. A flower print always feels optimistic and there’s no doubt we need feel-good fashion right now.

OPT FOR A CLASSIC PRINT

Take this subtle print maxi skirt from Me+Em. Being a William Morris print, it’s an instant classic. Remember to pick the right floral colours: go for a neutral base, but keep pops of colour or it runs the risk of looking drab. This look would work well toughened up with some chunky ankle boots.

SMALLER BLOOMS

Less obtrusive than the large florals that were around for summer, smaller blooms strike the perfect balance of subtle cheer. Look for bright versions (see box below) like this one in pretty pinks from Hush, or Tabitha Webb’s multi-coloured silk shirt that elevates jeans and is guaranteed to see you through the winter months.
