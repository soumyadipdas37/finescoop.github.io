Trapped inside a metal container for almost two months, this is the moment Monty the cat is rescued after his faint cries were heard by workers on an industrial estate.

The 12-year-old tabby survived without food or water after accidentally getting shut into the shipping container.

His distraught owner Beverley Chapman, 59, had all but given up hope of ever seeing the family pet again after it went missing from her home in Helston, Cornwall.

But this week as Richard Hall walked past the locked shipping container he heard a few weak cries coming from inside.

The boss of the sign making firm contacted the key holder and filmed the moment the heavy metal doors were opened and Monty was coaxed out to cries of 'Come on'.

One of his workers was so shocked he couldn't help swearing while others were shocked at how thin the cat was.

A bowl of milk and some cheese was quickly devoured by the starving cat

Monty is believed to have lapped up condensation that built up on the inside of the container to survive his ordeal.

Mr Hall took the cat to a local vet for a check up.

As Monty was fitted with a micro chip the vet was able to call Mrs Chapman and tell her beloved pet had been found.

She was overwhelmed with emotion at being reunited with Monty who often walked around the Water Ma Trout industrial estate where he was found.

'We think he was in the container for around eight weeks and lived on the condensation inside,' she said.

'When I saw his picture on Facebook after he was rescued, I thought, Oh my God, it's him. I cried then rang my daughter Jessica and asked her to go to the vets to collect him.

'I came back from work and he was sitting by the door just looking at me as if to say, what's all the fuss about?'

Mrs Chapman, an English teacher who lives in Helston, Cornwall, with her husband, Paul, 55, added: 'He's always been mischievous. If anyone's going to get into trouble, it's Monty.'

Mrs Chapman, an English teacher who lives in Helston, Cornwall, with her husband, Paul, added: 'He's always been mischievous. If anyone's going to get into trouble, it's Monty.' She had launched several Facebook appeals to try and find him

Mrs Chapman, who launched a series of Facebook appeals, said it was not the first time her pet had got into a scrape.

'At six months he was involved in an accident with a car and injured his back right leg and he's been attacked by two dogs.

'He must have 99 lives. He's cost us a fortune in vet bills but he's more precious than money. The vet said he's basically okay and just needs feeding up.

'We're very grateful to everyone who helped. I don't think any words can describe how elated we are to have him back home again.'Â
