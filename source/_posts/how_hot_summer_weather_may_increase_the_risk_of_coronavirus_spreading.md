Hot summer weather may increase the risk of coronavirus spreading, the deputy chief medical officer warned today.

Dr Nick Coatsworth said 'we cannot assume' that Covid-19 will behave like flu and decrease in warmer weather.

He warned that hotter weather will lead to more people moving around and gathering in crowds which could cause the disease to spread.

'We have to be clear that we do not yet know the impact of the seasons on Covid-19,' Dr Coatsworth said in the press conference on Wednesday. 

'We absolutely cannot assume that because we're moving into the summer months, when other respiratory viruses traditionally decrease, that COVID-19 would also decrease.'

Dr Coatsworth said summer posed two problems for public health. 

'One is movement of people across cities, across states, and the second one is crowds,' he said.

'If we can't assume COVID-19 will be any less transmitted, we have to assume the in crowds will potentially bring risk.'

He warned Australians to stay alert, keep distancing and get tested if they fall ill. 

'So the message is, as we move into the summer months, treat the summer with as much caution as you've treated winter,' he said.

'And that means keep physical distance. That means get tested if you're at all unwell. Don't go to a family gathering down at the beach if you're unwell or the kids are unwell. Stay at home and get yourself tested.'
