This is the shocking moment a 183ft crane plummeted on to the docks with the operator still inside the cabin after it was hit by one of the world's largest container ships.

The CCTV footage was recorded in the Port of Valencia, Spain, just after 9am as the crane's support legs started to buckle following the unexpected impact. 

One docker, identified as Roberto Manez Blanco, 48, was operating the crane at the time it fell.

He was able to warn his colleagues of the impending incident as they scarpered rapidly out of its path but he could not escape the cabin before it collapsed. 

Mr Blanco suffered several broken ribs and haemorrhaging as a result of the 183-foot (56-metre) fall to the ground but is reported to be out of danger.  

In the clip, which was recorded on September 13, the large green structure dominates the left-hand side of the screen.

The impact of the MSC Mia container ship, a 400-metre long vessel, is not picked up on camera but the crane can be seen starting to tilt following the collision. 

Its metal legs then begin to buckle under the weight as the structure comes crashing to the ground with workers desperately running to get out of its path.

Mr Blanco, who is being kept in the La Fe Polytechnical University Hospital in Valencia, is thought to have been the only person seriously injured during the incident. 

A second video shows the aftermath of the accident with part of the crane structure seen lying across the dock and another part resting in the water.

The camera pans to show the vast Mediterranean Shipping Company vessel that became tangled in the crane's lines after it passed too close.

The Panama-flagged ship is considered to be one of the largest container vessels in the world with the capacity to transport more than with 23,000 20-foot containers.  

The local police have been working alongside firefighters to clean up the debris. 

It is currently unclear if authorities are investigating the accident.
