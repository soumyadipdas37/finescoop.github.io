Premier League clubs are set to replace the Black Lives Matter slogan on players' shirts with a patch promoting the competition's own anti-discrimination campaign.

As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, no plans are in place to keep the controversial BLM symbol on jerseys when the new campaign kicks off this week.

It will be recommended to club captains in a call on Wednesday that a 'No Room for Racism' patch be placed below the Premier League badge on the sleeve.

A picture, shown to clubs and obtained by Sportsmail, shows what is intended. Consultation has taken place and it is expected that the move will be given the green light, although the captains still have the opportunity to raise their views.

There have been growing concerns that the BLM movement has been hijacked by extremists. The symbol was used following the resumption of football last season and the death of black American George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer.

However, groups linked to the BLM movement have posted anti-Semitic messages on social media. The call will also discuss whether to continue the practice of taking a knee. Following initial talks, sources have disclosed that the view among players is that they would like to continue doing so.

The Premier League launched the No Room for Racism campaign last year. At the time, sources close to football's anti-discrimination body Kick it Out said there were concerns the new campaign could result in mixed messages being put out.Â 

However, Kick It Out head Sanjay Bhandari later gave his backing to the initiative.

Earlier this week, the EFL announced that their clubs' shirts would bear the message 'Not Today or Any Day' this season in support of their ongoing campaign against all forms of discrimination.
