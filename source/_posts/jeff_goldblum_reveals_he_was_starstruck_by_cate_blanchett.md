Jeff Goldblum teased that he was rather 'star-struck' when he met Cate Blanchett on the set of Marvel's 2017 superhero sequel Thor: Ragnarok.

'Cate Blanchett plays Hela, that powerfully cosmically powerful witchy woman. She's so good. I'm deeply star-struck with her. She's spectacular,' Goldblum said. 

He also had wonderful things to say about Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, who he called a 'brilliant man, an enjoyable comedic force.'

'Working on this was fantastic. We improvised a lot, he fools around, I fool around, we did a lot of fun things on it,' Goldblum added.

When asked about his career, and what makes him say 'yes' to certain projects, Goldblum admits he's been 'lucky' for catching the acting bug.

'I know when I was a kid I was possessed by some kind of seed of passion or crazy inflammation of some kind that made me write on my steamy shower door when I was in high school every day 'Please, God, I want to be an actor,' and then I would erase it because it had to be a secret,' Goldblum said.

'I was deeply yearning for this life in acting, whatever I thought it was, and maybe that drew opportunity to me, or I was just plain lucky,' Goldblum added.

He noted that he doesn't have a 'strategy' and he just 'goes with my instincts and what appeals to me,' when it comes to choosing projects.

Now that he has a wife and kids at home, a project has to be 'very worthwhile' to leave them and go make a movie.

'It's really the same seeds of why I ever did it, which is kind of an adventure of passion and romance,' he added.

Strategy: He noted that he doesn't have a 'strategy' and he just 'goes with my instincts and what appeals to me,' when it comes to choosing projects

He added he's still 'hot on the trail' of a full creative life, and he feels like he's, 'on the brink' of doing some of his best work ever.

Goldblum is said to reprise his role as The Grandmaster in the new Marvel TV series What If...? which is expected to debut on the Disney Plus streaming service in 2021. 

The actor will also return to the Jurassic Park franchise as Ian Malcolm in the sequel Jurassic World: Dominion, which recently resumed production.
