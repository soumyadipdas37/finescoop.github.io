The Premier League have rejected a request from the EFL for a share of Fulham's parachute money to distribute to the lower divisions in another blow to cash-strapped clubs.

Under the terms of the parachute payment system introduced in 2006, Fulham's second-year payment of £34million automatically defaulted back to the Premier League following their promotion in July after one season in the Championship, leaving the elite clubs with an unexpected windfall.

Sportsmail has learned that the EFL wanted to keep that pot as part of a rescue package that has been demanded by Government, a request that is yet to be granted. As it stands, that money will instead be shared by the 20 Premier League clubs.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden made it clear in June that the Government's endorsement of Project Restart that allowed last season to be finished was contingent on the Premier League providing financial support for the rest of the football pyramid, but three months later there is no sign of a bailout being agreed.

The Football League season kicks off on Friday evening with the Championship clash between Watford and Middlesbrough, before a full programme of fixtures takes place this weekend in League One and League Two — competitions which were curtailed last season because the clubs were unable to afford the Covid-19 testing programme demanded by the Government.

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said on Wednesday that conversations were continuing with the EFL board over a rescue package, but it is understood that the clubs are divided about the extent of any financial assistance they are willing to provide.

The Premier League has already lost £630m in broadcasting income over the last few months and total losses could reach £1.25billion if fans are unable to attend matches all season, a major financial hit which has led several top-flight clubs to implement significant redundancy and cost-cutting measures.

Many EFL clubs are fighting for survival however, as they have effectively been operating without income since last season was shut down in March, with their £119m-a-year television contract split between 72 clubs not providing the safety net of the Premier League's £3bn deal, which is divided among 20.

After losing £50m last season, the EFL have put the financial impact of completing an entire season without fans at £200m, a crippling loss that would put many clubs out of business unless a rescue package is provided.

Negotiations with the Premier League have yielded little to date, so the EFL are looking at other funding options including a commercial loan, as Sportsmail revealed last month.

The Premier League have advanced around £77m to the EFL to help clubs with their cash shortfalls, but the lower-division sides have not received any extra funding, leading to fears they are simply storing up problems for later in the season.

'We are in conversation with our colleagues in the EFL,' Masters said. 'We can't put any time frame on it or go into any specifics at this stage.'
