She's no stranger to being the center of attention, recently proving she's indeed something of a Maneater.Â 

And Miley Cyrus continued to sizzle in the spotlight on Friday night, in her latest Instagram post ahead of her Saturday appearance at the 10th annualÂ iHeartRadio Music Festival.

The Younger Now songbird, 27, uploaded a trio of stunning photos by celebrity photographer Vijat M in which she donned an incredibly sexy sheer black body stocking, with artfully placed paneling to cover her modesty.

Getting the fans excited:Â Miley Cyrus continued to sizzle in the spotlight on Friday night, in her latest Instagram post ahead of her Saturday appearance at the iHeartRadio Music Festival

Cyrus milked the camera in the snaps, striking rock 'n roll poses and adding a trademark snarl to her perfectly tinted blood red lip.Â 

The styling in the photos was flawless as well, with Miley continuing her ode to Pat Benatar with her delightfully retro haircut and strong eye makeup.

In keeping with the showy elements in the photos, the Wrecking Ball hitmaker also rocked some welcome bling in the form of icy diamonds dripping from practically every appendage.

Sexy Miley: Her most recent share was just the latest post in which she's pushed the envelope of late

Miley tagged the iHeartRadio festival in the caption, an event which was already underway Friday with performances from Alicia Keys, Offset and Migos among others.

Miley's most recent share was just the latest post in which she's pushed the envelope of late.

On Thursday, the outspoken starlet danced topless in a black and white video clip, writing that 'being single means having more alone time to video myself stripping naked to Joan Jett'.

The gifted singer recently broke things off with her beau Cody Simpson, a fellow singer, whom she'd been seeing for 10 months.

It was just the latest breakup in a yearlong period that saw Miley end her decade-long on-off relationship with Liam Hemsworth last August with a divorce, followed by a brief rebound relationship with reality star Kaitlynn Carter.Â

Judging from her Instagram Stories on Friday evening, Miley may have been reliving some of those breakups, as seen in a shot from her bathtub while she was watching Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, an inventive 2004 film ruminating on how failed relationships are remembered.

On the bottom of the image, the We Can't Stop crooner wrote, 'In my f**king feelings'.

Meanwhile, Cyrus's 'Smiler' fanbase and others are anxiously awaiting the release of her next album, whose lead single is the hit track Midnight Sky.
