A woman and her four dogs were miraculously unharmed after being hit by a car. 

The unbelievable moment was caught on CCTV outside the Espresso3094 café on in Montmorency in Melbourne's north-east. 

Confronting footage shows the woman being knocked to the ground before the car ploughs into the wall of the coffee shop on Thursday morning.

One of the woman's dogs can be seen crawling out from under the car before the driver manages to reverse out of the way. 

The dog-walker was taken to Austin Hospital with only minor injuries, while the dogs were taken to a veterinary clinic overnight for observation.  

Police say the woman accidentally put her foot on accelerator instead of the brakes while she was reversing out of her parking space.

The 63-year-old woman was issued with a $397 penalty notice for careless driving. 

While the coffee shop was open at the time of the collision, due to COVID-19 restrictions no customers were allowed inside.

The workers said they ran out to help when they heard the car smash into the front of the coffee shop.  

'We just heard screaming and the glass breaking,' one of the workers told Nine News.

Espresso3094 owners Alex and Cathy Kamvissis thanked the community for responding so quickly.
