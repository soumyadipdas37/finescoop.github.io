A new season is officially here and while it's always sad to say goodbye to the summer, we're ready for some autumnal action.

And as we all know, the fashion gets really good at this time of year.

So, if you're ready for a wardrobe update we're here to help.

There are plenty of trends to get stuck into but we've picked out 5 of our favourites to get you going. 

Let us know which you'll be rocking this season in the comments below... 

 1. For the love of lilac

For the love of lilac at BOSS, Alberta Ferretti and Jacquemus AW20

Pastel shades are always a lovely and feminine choice.

But for AW20 it's all about lilac.

This washed out hue is ultra pretty but somehow retains a touch of cool where a pale pink can often look too girly for some.  

We love this fringed dress as seen at BOSS AW20 and we're crushing HARD on the styling at both Alberta Ferretti and Jacquemus AW20.

Pairing lilac trousers with darker, and even lighter, shades of purple is such a gorgeous way to wear it.

Plus, Prince would be proud.

 2. Bold checks

Bold checks at Brock Collection, Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen AW20

Checks, tartan and plaid are never very far away, but for AW20 they're bigger, bolder and brighter than ever before. 

At Brock Collection they strutted down the runway in mustard yellow and purple, while at Christian Dior they were Clueless-adjacent in this cute little tartan mini kilt.

And at Alexander McQueen the checks were rotated to fall on the diagonal and were seriously outsized too.

So add some checks into your style as separates, as outerwear or as an eye-catching full look this season.

3. Ravishing in red

Ravishing in red at Altuzarra, Alexander McQueen and Balmain AW20

Anyone looking for a statement shade to rock this season can relax.

Autumn's foremost primary colour is ravishing red. Or sexy scarlet, depending on how you look at things.

If you're a little shy then just add one piece of red to your look with a blouse or skirt, but if you want to turn heads then follow the lead of designers like Altuzarra, Alexander McQueen and Balmain.

Their models sashayed down the catwalk in top-to-toe looks and there's no denying the drama they created. So why not do the same?

4. The new bodycon

The new bodycon at Altuzarra, Balmain and Brandon Maxwell AW20 

If someone says bodycon to you, what images spring to mind?

Maybe a Kardashian or an early TOWIE cast member in a bandage dress and skyscraper heels?

Well, forget that particular brand of bodycon and embrace a fresh new take.

Bodycon is short for 'body conscious' which doesn't have to mean skin tight. It also doesn't need to mean short.

For AW20 bodycon is ever so slightly more relaxed. It's knitted, ribbed and more demure. Think Altuzarra's fitted skirt, Balmain's form-fitting knit and Brandon Maxwell's high neck and long sleeves. 

This is bodycon that's elegant and understated, but definitely still sexy.

 5. Luxe in leather

Luxe in leather at Brandon Maxwell, Balenciaga and Isabel Marant AW20

Leather never really goes out of style but it's a big part of AW20 so if you've never worn it before then now is the time.

Leather is one of those materials that adds a feeling of luxury in an instant. However you wear it, you'll immediately look a bit more 'expensive'. 

Start with leather trousers. Skinny styles were seen at Brandon Maxwell or do the paper bag waist look like at Isabel Marant. 

Then why not add a leather skirt, dress or coat to your capsule wardrobe? 

And it goes without saying you don't need to buy the real deal to achieve the luxe look. 

Faux leather is not only much more affordable, but is the vegan option too!

Kenzo's pleated knit midi dress nails the new bodycon trend and will look fly with sneakers or chunky ankle boots, while this pencil dress by V by Very, ramps up the raciness a notch or two.

 Luxe in leather

Go faux to get the luxe leather look this season.

Slim cigarette trousers are a cool alternative to jeans, while River Island's high waisted pencil skirt will look fantastic with a tank top and trainers as you strut around town.
