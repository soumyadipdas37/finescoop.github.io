Elsewhere in the interview, Matty spoke about the signs that made him guess that Laura was pregnant. 

'There were so many obvious signs. You were sick in the morning, you were a little bit tired all the time, you stopped drinking wine at night,' he said.

Laura admitted she was crazy hormonal and 'angry' about everything, which she believed 'gave it away' a bit.

Laura confirmed that while the new baby is a 'lockdown baby', it was a planned pregnancy.

'It's a Covid baby, but a very planned Covid baby. It coincided at the same time,' she exclaimed.
