David Warner recently touched down in the United Arab Emirates for the Indian Premier League. 

And on Friday, the 33-year-old shared a photograph to Instagram featuring himself and teammate Pat Cummins in full personal protective equipment (PPE) kits on the plane. 

The cricketer explained that the team had to wear the protective garments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pic comes after David reflected on his marriage with his wife Candice Warner, 35 on Tuesday. 

Posting to Instagram, he shared a throwback snap from their wedding and explained 'how lucky' he was to have her.

'When time flies, you sometimes forget to reflect on how lucky we are, especially when you look back at memories,' he wrote.

'I truly am grateful!' On Tuesday, cricketer David delivered a gushing tribute to his wife Candice (both pictured) as he reflected on the 'ups and downs' of their marriage 

The sportsman explained that 'six years and three children later' he still loves to reminisce about all the reasons why he married his 'soul mate and best friend'.

And while he admitted that the couple have experienced their fair share of 'laughter, tears, ups and downs', he is always 'grateful' to have Candice by his side.

'Words will never be enough to describe what @candywarner1 means to me. I truly am grateful I have such a strong, determined, loving, caring wife.'
