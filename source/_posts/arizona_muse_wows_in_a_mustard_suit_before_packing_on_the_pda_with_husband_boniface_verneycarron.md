She recently wowed in a stunning red ballgown as she arrived at the Marx premiere during the 77th Venice Film Festival. 

And Arizona Muse showcased her model credentials once again in a linen mustard suit as she stepped out at the Hotel Excelsior in the Italian city on Sunday. 

The British-American star, 31, looked effortlessly chic as she packed on the PDA with her beau, Boniface Verney-Carron, whom she married in 2017.

Completing her look, Arizona layered a simple high-neck white t-shirt under her yellow ensemble and cinched in her waist with the belt of her trousers tied in a bow. 

She toted a miniature leather Lulu Guinness handbag in a bright yellow hue over her shoulder which featured a sweet tan keyring. 

Arizona opted for flat gladiator tan sandals for the occasion.

The model wore barely a scrap of makeup and tied the top half of her caramel locks in a loose ponytail.  

Arizona was seen locking lips with Boniface before the pair embraced at the side of the water. 

He wore a light blue unbuttoned shirt paired with dark shorts and finished his look with a black bandana across his forehead.

The model was also seen putting safety first in a white pattered face mask as she sorted through items in a suitcase.   

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on 2 September and ends on the 12 September. 

Arizona welcomed her first child Nikko, 10, with fashion stylist and former flame Manuel Quintana when she was 20.

The couple eventually split, and she married Boniface three years ago, welcoming a daughter with him at the end of 2018.

Speaking to Town and Country magazine recently, the beauty reflected on being a young parent. 

She said: 'I don’t know what it’s like to be a 20-year-old who didn’t have a child. I loved having Nikko.

'He was like a doll. I was a child myself and it was an "ignorance is bliss" situation.'

Arizona candidly admitted her reasoning for marriage being particularly meaningful to her, given that Nikko 'doesn't have a relationship' with her ex-fiancé Manuel.

She said: 'It meant a lot to me to get married. Especially because I already had a child who doesn’t have a relationship with his dad.' 

Touching on how she burnt herself out by working and parenting in the early days, she told: 'By the time Nikko was three, I was totally exhausted.'

Arizona battled on because she feared that if she took time off her career would disappear - which caused her massive amounts of stress that she 'was under, every single day, for years'.

She added: 'I probably needed to take some time off, but I was stuck in this fear cycle.

Arizona announced the arrival of her baby daughter by sharing an adorable snap of her laying alongside the newborn in November 2018.
