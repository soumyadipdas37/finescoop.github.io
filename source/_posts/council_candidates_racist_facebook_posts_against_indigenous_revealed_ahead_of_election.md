An aspiring councillor has been forced to issue a grovelling apology after for sharing racist memes mocking Indigenous Australians.  

Jane Agirtan, who is a candidate for Kingson Council in Melbourne's south-east, said she made the Facebook posts when she was going through a 'deeply personal time'. 

The old Facebook posts resurfaced after she launched her campaign for the local council election in October.

Ms Agirtan shared memes targeting Indigenous Australians, same-sex parents and international students on her personal page between 2014 and 2018. 

In one meme there was a picture of an Indigenous elder with the caption: 'Spends all his money on petrol, doesn't own a car'.

Ms Agirtan posted another comment in Russian saying in her 'ideal world, Aborigines would live the same way minus housing, gasoline, VB and benefits and doctors flying in helicopter reservation'.

She also said same-sex parents were depriving children of their right to know their biological parents.

The would-be councillor issued a desperate apology to the Herald Sun and confirmed that the content had been taken down.

'I apologise unreservedly for the Facebook posts and memes in question, which I believe have been removed,' she said. 

Ms Agirtan said the posts are not consistent with her current views and says she was going through a 'difficult personal situation' at the time.

'I deeply apologise to anyone who may have been offended,' she said.

Kingston Mayor Georgina Oxley said members of the local community had been 'deeply hurt' after seeing the posts.

Ms Oxley said the remarks were 'divisive and upsetting' and 'insight hate towards the groups', with behaviour like that having 'no place in the Kingston community'.

'I want to assure those members in our community who may be deeply hurt by these remarks that these are not the views of our community,' she said.
