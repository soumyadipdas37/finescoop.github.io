Elizabeth made headlines last week when she deactivated her Instagram account after trolls attacked her for not speaking publicly on the death of actor Chadwick Boseman.  

The Black Panther star passed away in August due to complications relating to colon cancer and he received an outpouring of messages online from grieving friends and fans. 

Elizabeth and Chadwick worked together on Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

Fans also slammed his former co-star Lupita Nyong'o last week for not acknowledging his death on social media, however, she did release a poignant statement on Tuesday.  

Elizabeth most recently starred in the Facebook Watch series, Sorry For Your Loss, where she played Leigh Shaw who is struggling to come to terms with the sudden passing of her husband.

The show was cancelled in January, but the actress will return to screens as her Marvel character, Wanda Maximoff, in the new series, WandaVision, which is expected to be released in 2021 on Disney Plus streaming service.
