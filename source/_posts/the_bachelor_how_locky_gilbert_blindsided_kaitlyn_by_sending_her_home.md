Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for thinking there are only two women in the running for Locky Gilbert's heart: Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska.

But ex-contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe, who was sent home on Thursday, claims there were unaired scenes that would have made her look like one of the front-runners, too.

The personal assistant, 26, told Now To Love on Monday that former Australian Survivor star Locky, 31, had mentioned their 'strong connection' multiple times on camera - but these soundbites weren't shown on TV.

Locky's brutal blindside: How The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (pictured) told Kaitlyn Hoppe they were 'going to the next level' in an unaired scene - only to send her home before the final four 

In fact, Kaitlyn received hardly any screen time compared to Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, even though they shared a genuine romantic bond.

'Honestly, we were going to the next level, we wanted to meet each other's family,' Kaitlyn said of her relationship with Locky.

She said they grew unexpectedly close during lockdown, and that multiple scenes of them bonding on group dates and in solo settings never made it to air.

Their connection was so strong that Kaitlyn - who previously dated tennis star Bernard Tomic - was blindsided when Locky sent her home before the final four.

'He told me he trusted our connection': Their bond was so strong that Kaitlyn - who previously dated Bernard Tomic - was blindsided when Locky sent her home before the final four

'That was the reason why I thought I wasn't going home,' she said. 

Kaitlyn insinuated that Locky had led her on right up until the moment she did not receive a rose in the tenth episode. 

'I asked him, "Why haven't you taken me on a date?" And you know what he told me? He goes, "It's because I trust our connection already." That's why I was so confident, and then when I [didn't get a rose] it was really confusing,' she said. 

Daily Mail Australia had contacted Locky Gilbert for comment.

Who will win his heart? Locky's final four contestants are (L-R) Izzy Sharman-Firth, Irena Srbinovska, Bec Cvilikas and Bella Varelis 

Izzy Sharman-Firth, Irena Srbinovska, Bec Cvilikas and Bella Varelis were chosen by Locky to proceed to finals week.

Bella is widely believed to be the heartbroken runner-up and Irena is tipped to win, according to betting agencies TAB and Sportsbet.
