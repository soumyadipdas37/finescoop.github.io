The claws were out when Australian breakfast show Sunrise took aim at Carole Baskin this week. 

Carole - a 'big cat' rights activist known for her villainous portrayal in Netflix's Tiger King - made headlines this month after joining Dancing With The Stars US.  

And on Thursday, Sunrise reported on Carole's new reality TV career during a brief news segment, while simultaneously poking fun at the 59-year-old over allegations she killed her husband and fed him to tigers in 1997.  

As footage of Carole competing on the DWTS stage played on-screen, Sophie Ellis-Bextor's hit tune, Murder On The Dancefloor, could be heard playing in the background.     

Of course, Tiger King fans would know that Carole was accused by her rival Joe Exotic of killing her late husband Don Lewis and 'feeding him to tigers' in her sanctuary.

Carole, who is now married to Howard Baskin, has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied the accusations made in the hit documentary.

The Big Cat Rescue CEO's former spouse went missing in 1997, six years after they married in 1991, and was legally declared dead in 2002 as he is yet to be found.     

It comes amid reports Carole is being sued for defamation by Don's family. 

His daughters Gale, Lynda and Donna and his former assistant Anne McQueen have taken legal action against Carole, as they claim she was 'complicit' with jokes made by judges about his disappearance during her current stint Dancing With The Stars.

According to TMZ, legal documents state that Don's relatives have an issue with Carole failing to dispute DWTS judge Bruno Tonioli when he called her paso doble 'sedated' and quipped she didn't quite 'kill' it.

The media personality is also facing a lawsuit for promising to 'really kill it next week' on the celebrity dance show during an interview on Good Morning Britain.

Don's family attorney John Phillips claims Carole settled a libel and slander case from Anne for $50,000.
