The outing comes after Hugh lost out on the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie to Mark Ruffalo last week 

The star participated in a first-of-its-kind virtual Emmy Awards telecast hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

He was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role in Bad Education but lost out to Mark, who played two characters in I Know This Much is True.

Due to the pandemic, nominees were streamed in to the show from all around the globe via professional production kits sent out by the Academy.

For the major awards, a crew member in a hazmat suit was sent to wherever the nominees were beaming in from with the golden Emmy statute - ready to present it if they won.

That meant even the losers of each category were able to glimpse the award that just slipped through their fingers.

Emmy's producer Phil Rosenberg was on such crew member who was dispatched to Hugh and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness's multi million dollar Manhattan apartment.

'Every single one of us were sent an Emmy, none of them were engraved,' Rosenberg told E! News. 'Only Ernst & Young knew who the winners were, they keep that under lock-and-key…We had to send [awards] to every person's house.'

Rosenberg said the team used a app similar to a Walkie-Talkie to communicate globally and only found out who'd won the category seconds before the presenter announced the name.

'Before they went into the category, during a commercial break, there was a moment where all of the nominees got pushed into a Zoom together and they could chat,' Rosenberg explained. 'I overheard them congratulating each other.'

When Ruffalo was announced the winner of Hugh's category, Rosenberg said there is was a bit tense but ultimately the actor was gracious.

'They seemed great about it,' he said. 'They had a great time, they were the sweetest of people.' 

As for Hugh, despite his loss, he has received wide praise from fans and critics alike for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in Bad Education, with many calling it the actor's best performance yet.

And, Hugh and Deborra-Lee still had plenty to celebrate as Bad Education did take home a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie on Saturday.
