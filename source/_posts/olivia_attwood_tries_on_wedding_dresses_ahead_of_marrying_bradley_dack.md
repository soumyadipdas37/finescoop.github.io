Her wedding plans with Bradley Dack took a backseat during lockdown. 

Yet Olivia Attwood revealed she was back in planning mode on Tuesday as she tried on wedding dresses at Blackburn Bridal Couture. 

Joined by her mother Jenny for the day, the Love Island star, 29, seemed to be in her element as she slipped in and out of gowns.

Olivia looked sensational in a slinky column gown with sheer panels and lace adornment. 

The bride-to-be was a vision in the dress, which featured a low cut neckline and sheer full length skirt with a mini train. 

Sharing a quick video inside the boutique, Olivia mused: 'I've started looking for my dress today. My crew are in tow... because why not? Let's get married baby!'

Fans will be able to see more gowns when her new reality TV show airs on ITVBe this autumn.

The eight-episode series will follow Olivia and her Blackburn Rovers footballer fiancé Bradley, 26, as they plan their wedding and buy their first home in Cheshire.

The couple got engaged in Dubai last year and the programme will document their relationship as they prepare to take it the next level, with Olivia planning her dream wedding.

Bride squad: Olivia had her mother Jenny with her to help pick out a gown, who she cheekily referred to as 'queen of the hoes' 

Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.

However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore. 

Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson. 

Speaking to OK! magazine last week, Olivia revealed that her wedding plans were thrown up in the air when the coronavirus pandemic hit. 

She explained: 'We had our hearts set on a destination wedding, but I’m opening up to the idea of a UK wedding because we want to get married next year and definitely can’t afford to go into quarantine for two weeks.

'I’m going to look at some UK venues and see if they can turn my head.'
