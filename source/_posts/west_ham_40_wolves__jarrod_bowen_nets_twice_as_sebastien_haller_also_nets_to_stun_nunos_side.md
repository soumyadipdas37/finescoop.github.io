David Moyes might be a manager who likes to suffer on the touchline and feel the pressure of the game but he could probably he could get used to this.

Sunday evenings, at home on the sofa, with his feet up and the widescreen TV turned to BT Sports, with refreshment to hand, as he feasted on his team's display against Wolves, a second victory in six days since he was ordered into isolation.

Assistant boss Alan Irvine took the strain at the London Stadium and coach Stuart Pearce sat by the phone to stay in contact with Moyes, who tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of a Carabao Cup tie against Hull last week. 



Jarrod Bowen led West Ham to their first three points of the Premier League season on Sunday

Bowen's opener against Wolves injected confidence into their performance before the break 

Nuno Espirito Santo has a lot to ponder after a thrashing from the relegation favourites 

The Hammers manager is more likely to have taken to his remote control dressed in his tracksuit and boots, pacing the front room.

Still, he could have been forgiven had he changed channels to catch the end of Antiques Roadshow or Family Fortunes once his team went 3-0 up, early in the second half, courtesy of two goals from Jarrod Bowen and one from Tomas Soucek, which came with the help of a deflection.

Moyes, were he tempted, would have missed Sebastien Haller heading in a fourth in stoppage time to complete a convincing victory. Unfortunately, for Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, there was no such option.

'Very bad,' said Nuno. 'Unbalanced, disorganised, losing duels. Offensively, we didn't create, we were not able to break West Ham. Every counter-attack was a chance at goal and it created anxiety in the team. Not good at all, very disappointing.' 

Michail Antonio was superb for West Ham, causing Wolves constant problems in attack

Bowen's second goal came after a lot of West Ham chances and effective counter-attacks 

West Ham, already into the last 16 of the Carabao Cup, are off the mark with their first points of the Premier League campaign and some of the angst accompanying the start of a new campaign at the club can ease.

Bowen’s first goal since February gave the Londoners the initiative. Pablo Fornals released him with a quick free-kick from midfield, after Willy Boly flattened Michail Antonio. Bowen jinked inside from the right, drove into the penalty area and curled a wonderful shot around Roman Saiss and inside the far post, out of Rui Patricio’s reach.

Wolves boss Nuno disputed the free-kick, claiming it was taken from the wrong place and that the ball might have still been rolling. Fornals did not stop the ball but, as Antonio and Boly tangled on the turf, he sized up the situation in a flash and fizzed a pass to Bowen.

Referee Martin Atkinson and his assistants were happy with it. West Ham were ahead and ought to have scored more before half-time. Patricio made three fine saves, each one better than the last. One from Antonio and two from Soucek.  

The Hammers' Pablo Fornals missed an absolute sitter from close-range with the scores at 1-0 

The second from Soucek was a terrific reaction save, low close to his feet to keep out a strong header at the back post.

Wolves were unzipped with ease on the turnover, in the first half. West Ham defended the edge of their own penalty area impressively, Declan Rice’s distribution out of defence made them dangerous on the break, and the visitors were hustled into mistakes on the ball, deep in their own territory.

Fornals should have extended the lead two minutes before the interval. Patricio saved again from Antonio but could only push his drive towards the penalty spot. Fornals arrived with the goal open and cleared the goal with comfort.  

Adama Traore was hauled-off in the second-half after struggling to make a big impact

It was an awful finish and yelps of anguish came from the West Ham technical area and rang around the empty stadium.

Belatedly, Wolves stirred, perhaps realising they were fortunate to be only a goal adrift. When Pedro Neto summoned their first effort on goal, it was little more than a routine save for Lukasz Fabianski but it seemed significant as it represented their arrival in the contest.

Briefly they performed with greater purpose and intensity, although their vulnerability on the counter-attack allowed Bowen to score his second and end hopes of a fightback. 

Tomas Soucek headed in from a corner as West Ham hit full stride in the second half on Sunday

Substitute Sebastien Haller completed the thrashing of Wolves with a header in injury-time 

Antonio ran the ball down the West Ham left and picked out Fornals, who took a touch and went for goal from just outside the penalty box. His effort thumped into the post and popped out to Bowen who tapped it into the net.

Bowen went close to a hat-trick as he arrived to meet a cross from Arthur Masuaku. The ball flashed wide, although West Ham’s third of the evening soon followed. 

Aaron Cresswell’s corner was met at the near post by a glancing header from Soucek and Patricio was deceived as it clipped Raul Jimenez on the chest and flew into the goal.

Haller came on to score the fourth from another terrific Masuaku cross. West Ham have won twice and scored nine without Moyes, who might think twice about rushing back when he has the all clear.

Host commentator

All done at the London Stadium as West Ham score their first points of the 2020-21 season with an absolute rout. What a way to do it... with their manager watching on the telly.

A Jarrod Bowen double and headers from Tomas Soucek and Sebastien Haller will leave an uninspiring Wolves much to ponder. 

The Hammers were confident, free-flowing and efficient. What was the last time that could be said of David Moyes' team? 

Wolves have taken a thrashing tonight. Sebastien Haller heads in from a superb Masuaku cross, lighting up a slow-paced finale in injury-time. 

West Ham take Bowen and Antonio off to get their applause from the crowd... oh wait. Fantastic performances from the two men strolling back to the dugouts.  

Haller and club captain Mark Noble on the field now. 

Looks like the game will end the way it started, calmly. Wolves dead and buried now and consigned to their fate, some half-hearted attacks being palmed away by the hosts. 

The Hammers cruising for an absolutely huge result

Nelson Semedo's debut is done, he'll be disappointed with that. In his place Hoever comes on, Wolves' recent arrival from Liverpool.

Moutinho is also off with Vitinha - another new face - on for the final part of the game.

Game over surely, West Ham flying! Tomas Soucek flicks in a corner, heading United into a commanding lead.

Wolves just not at the races today. Fabio Silva has a big job to do now if he's to make a difference... 

Wolves' big summer signing Fabio Silva is on, with Adama Traore being replaced. 

The visitors need a quick impact from Silva now. Strange one to bring Traore off? 

Wow, what a performance this is from West Ham. Antonio the main man again as the hosts pour forward. Fornals fires a shot onto the post which bounces back for Bowen to tap in easily - his second of the night. 

The Hammers are brimming with confidence now, as Antonio goes close again. 

Connor Coady sees yellow for barging Antonio off the ball. The West Ham forward has been relentlessly effective tonight. 

The free-kick from wide on the left sees Cresswell cross into Ogbonna, who can't get over the ball enough. 

Ryan Fredericks pulls up injured after making a run and has to limp off, as Ben Johnson comes on in his place. 

No half-time changes, we've switched ends, lets go...

It's a surprise scoreline at the break as West Ham's slick, confident counter-attacks pay off. 

Fornals was sharp in taking a quick free-kick to assist Jarrod Bowen for the opener on 16 minutes, cutting in from the right and bending in past Patricio. 

The Hammers had plenty more chances with Antonio proving a serious handful. The visitors have been much more pedestrian but an improvement in the second-half could really ignite this game. 

Wow, what a miss. Fornals blazes over as Patricio parries a powerful Antonio strike straight into the path of the winger. Essentially an empty net. 

That could cost the Hammers, has to get over the ball more.

That chance comes moments after more excellent play, as Bowen finds Cresswell who fires an excellent cross into Antonio, but Wolves deal with it. 

Antonio finds space for a shot on the turn but it goes wide after another rapid Hammers counter-attack. 

Wolves's defensive just has no answer, Antonio proving a real handful. 

Some clever build-up play from Wolves leads to a Ruben Neves blaster, which is deflected out for a corner. Jimenez jumps but it's a little high. 

Wolves are improving now, starting to look more themselves. But West Ham are very dangerous on the counter-attack. Showing real fight

The Hammers almost double the lead, as Rui Patricio makes a superb save but can only parry, as about five of the hosts' forwards have a stab at scoring. Wolves clear, just. 

Shaping into a fascinating game. 

Neto goes for a 25-yard strike, trying to bend into the far corner around Fabianski. Close

The hosts are in control after their goal with a series of chances. After a tough start they look encouraged by the lead. Rui Patricio has been busy since the opener. 

The Hammers LEAD! Profiting from some Wolves confusion as Antonio ends up on top of Semedo, Fornals plays it though for Bowen to cut inside and bend into the far corner. Wolves will be fuming, they thought the referee would stop play for a foul. Play to the whistle lads...

The Hammers are looking confident now, as Antonio fashions another chance. 

Neto with some superb skill, knocks the ball round one side of Fabian Balbuena before unleashing a searing sprint around the other side, beating the defender to the ball before winning a corner. 

Moutinho plays this one short too, but Wolves make a mess of it and the chance fizzles out. 

Neto and Traore look very sharp. 

Both teams really evenly balanced here, yet to see a flash of quality despite some of the talents on display tonight. 

Jimenez chopped down, Wolves get a free-kick from deep but Moutinho plays it short. Very, very slow so far. 

Both sides just getting a feel for the ball in these opening minutes, neither pressing too hard as the ball gets stuck in midfield

The referee's stopwatch is rolling as West Ham get us underway at the London Stadium. 

Every game is crucial for West Ham right now, a turnaround is desperately needed. 

West Ham fans might not be in the ground but they are still getting their message of discontent across to the owners... 

Teams are on their way out of the tunnel in front of the silent London Stadium stands, with moments to go until kick-off. 

Both sides in their traditional home kits, with the hosts in claret and blue, Wolves in orange and black. 

Bubbles are, obviously, blowin'.

Wolves broke their record transfer fee this summer to sign 18-year-old Portuguese centre-forward Fabio Silva. 

The youngster made his debut with a goalless substitute appearance in Wolves' 3-1 defeat to Manchester City last time out. 

The experienced Moutinho is enjoying mentoring the younger players in Nuno's side, and is backing Silva for success in England. 

Nuno Espirito Santo has since called for coronavirus test results to return sooner after the David Moyes fiasco. 

'It’s stressful, difficult and disruptive,' the Wolves boss said. 

David Moyes will be absent from the London Stadium tonight, with Hammers assistant Alan Irvine the main man in the dugout of the struggling hosts. 

Moyes, Issa Diop and Josh Cullen all tested positive for coronavirus before facing Hull - adding to the East Londoners' woes.
