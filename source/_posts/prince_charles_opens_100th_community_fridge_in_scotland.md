The Prince of Wales joined a charity for the unveiling of their 100th community fridge in Scotland today. 

Prince Charles, 71, opened the community fridge at Dumfries House in East Ayrshire with community fridge network manager Kanahaya Alam.

The pair smiled and joked together as they stood outside to reveal the new apparatus which aims to help bring together the local community to tackle food waste.

It marked his return to in-person duties after a summer break at Birkhall on the Queen's Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire.

Charles and Kanahaya Alam opened the new community fridge together, the 100th of its kind in the UK. The latest addition is located at Dumfries House in East Ayrshire

His Royal Highness and Kanahaya Alam were pictured standing in front of the fridge, which was filled with fresh fruit and vegetables. 

The royal, who wore a cream overcoat for the appearance due to the colder weather, held open the fridge for a young blonde girl who placed a selection of vegetables in a basket into the food store.  

The Community Fridge Network, run by environmental charity Hubbub, supports community fridges across the UK to share good food from local businesses and individuals that would have otherwise gone to waste.

The 100th addition was set up at Dumfries House, part of The Prince's Foundation - an educational charity established by the Prince of Wales in 1986.

The organisation aims to support people in their efforts to create communities, such as championing a sustainable approach to how we live our lives and build our homes to teaching traditional arts and skills.

As well as his cream coat, the white haired Prince wore dark grey suit trousers and pair of shiny brown formal shoes. 

His appearance comes just days after Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle , 39, announced that they had totally refunded the Sovereign Grant for the redevelopment of five-bedroom Frogmore Cottage on the Queen's Berkshire estate. 

The couple, who had been paying back the cash in monthly instalments, were said to be 'very relieved and very pleased' to have been able to pay off the debt so quickly,' a source close to the couple told Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl. 

'This has been a pro-active step and something they wanted to do from the outset.

'There was no requirement [from the Queen] for them to pay the money back but it was important to them that they did, and after the Netflix deal they were in a position to do so. I think this is quite a significant moment for them.'

It was revealed in the wake of the couple's decision to step back from their royal roles and to live in America that the Prince of Wales would make a private financial contribution to help them during their first year away. 

It is believed the total amount was around £1million.
