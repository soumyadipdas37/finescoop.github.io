Leaked emails have revealed health authorities knew a man thought to have died from COVID-19 didn't in fact the virus - but didn't tell his family or the public for three days.

Nathan Turner, 30, was initially declared Australia's youngest coronavirus fatality when he was found dead in his Blackwater home, in regional Queensland, on May 26. 

An initial swab had tested positive, plunging the tiny town into panic-mode and his fiancee into isolation, before further tests concluded he did not have the virus.  

Now, emails obtained by Nine News have revealed senior officials - including Chief Health Officer Jeanette Young and Deputy Chief Health Officer Sonya Bennett - received the negative results on May 29 but kept residents in the dark until June 1.

That includes Mr Turner's grieving fiancee Simone Devon and other close contacts who were kept in quarantine until the final autopsy results were announced on the Monday evening. 

In correspondence on May 28, Dr Young and Dr Bennett learned a re-tested sample had failed to detect COVID-19,  with a blood test, among other tests, proving negative the following day.   

Despite the growing body of evidence, the case was then referred on for an autopsy on Friday, May 29. 

But when the results came back three days later, the coroner cited the prior reports.  

'Further extensive and more specialised testing before autopsy was conducted by a Forensic & Scientific Services pathologist and those tests have all returned a repeated negative result to COVID-19,' the email reads.

Emails reveal health officials were aware the results were negative on May 29 before telling the public on June 1, leaving Mr Turner's fiance Simone Devon (pictured together) for an additional three days

'As a result of the extensive further specialised testing I advise that at present, despite significant and widespread reporting, cause of death is confirmed as not being related to the COVID-19 virus.' 

On the Monday morning, Dr Bennett sent an email asking the team if 'we were aware' the serology results they had received on May 29 had been negative. 

The public did not learn the news until later that evening.  

Health Minister Steven Miles has denied that his department mishandled the information, saying the public were alerted as soon as they knew of the new information.

Lorraine Devon, Ms Devon's mother, said they have been left devastated by their experience, which saw them spend a week in isolation and be taunted by rumours surrounding Mr Turner's death. 

'What we had to endure after they came out with the rumours and innuendo,' she said. 

Mystery surrounded the suspected coronavirus case, after it was revealed Mr Turner had not left the small town in months and there were no other known local cases. 

The case rocked the tiny town of Blackwater, which immediately set up testing clinics Pictured: Locals queue to get coronavirus tests 

His death sparked fears of an outbreak in Blackwater and locals were tested en masse that week.

Ms Devon tested negative to the virus three times and more than 500 Blackwater residents also returned negative results.

It was reported a nurse from Rockhampton could have been the source of infection after she broke travel restrictions to drive 195km to Blackwater on May 10.

The nurse, whose name wasn't revealed, told authorities she had taken a 400km round trip to 'watch the sunset' in the mining town.

Officials then said it was 'unlikely' the nurse was the cause of Mr Turner's infection because of the timing of her bizarre trip.

Her trip was 17 days before Mr Turner's death, and he was reportedly suffering symptoms 21 days before he passed away.

The nurse insisted that she never left her car during the road trip, and had no contact with other people.

Daily Mail Australia  has contacted Queensland Health for comment.

Mystery surrounded the suspected coronavirus case, after it was revealed Mr Turner had not left the small town in months and there were no other known local cases. 

Since his May 26 death, Mr Turner's family maintained they didn't believe COVID-19 caused his death, as he also suffered from epilepsy and asthma, and regularly caught the flu. 

MONDAY JUNE 1: Autopsy found Mr Turner did not have the deadly virus. 

Mr Turner's friends created a Change.org petition calling on Ms Palaszczuk and chief health officer Jeannette Young to apologise to his family and the community for creating 'chaos and panic'. 

Queensland Health confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that further tests have returned negative for COVID-19.  

'The Coroner tonight advised that further tests have returned negative for COVID-19. He is yet to determine the man's cause of death,' Dr Young said.
