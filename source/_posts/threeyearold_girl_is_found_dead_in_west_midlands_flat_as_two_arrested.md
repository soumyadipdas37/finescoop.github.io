A three-year-old girl has been found dead in a flat after a man and a woman - both aged 21 - were arrested for child neglect. 

Kaylee-Jayde Priest was found by police at a property in Kingshurst, West Midlands, on August 9. 

Her step-father Dan Gregory, 22, told of his devastation at his daughter's death, calling her a 'smiling and beautiful girl'.

He told the Birmingham Mail: 'I was in her life when she was under the age of one. I helped bring her up when I was with her mum for two years. 

'Kaylee did play a big part in my life. I was devastated when I found out she had died. I still don't know what happened.'

West Midlands Police have arrested a woman, 21, on suspicion of wilful neglect of a child and a man the same age for wilful ill-treatment. 

Both have been released on bail as the investigation continues. 

An inquest was opened Birmingham Coroner's Court on August 19 and then adjourned. 

Writing on a crowdfunding page, Mr Gregory said: 'It would be amazing if you could help support us give this young girl the best send-off she deserves. Any donation big or small. It all helps.

'It would be much appreciated if you can help. We can do this if we pull together. RIP Kaylee-Jayde Preist. Fly high princess, we love and miss you so much.'
