Nicole said she and her new partner were required to keep their romance a secret until her dumping had officially aired on TV.

'What people don't know is there was a massive period of time in between leaving the mansion and commencing the 'Love In Lockdown' virtual dating,' she said.

Nicole said due to the time spent apart, she and Locky 'fizzled out'.

'When we got back to filming "Love In lockdown", I was just like *groans* I don't think it's there,' she admitted. 

'As soon as you stop filming in the mansion, and as soon as you're out of the bubble, it snaps you back into reality. Yeah he was cool, but nah.'
