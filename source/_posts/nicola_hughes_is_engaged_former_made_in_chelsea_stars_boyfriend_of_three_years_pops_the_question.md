Loved-up: The pair were enjoying a loved up couple's holiday in Ibiza when business owner Charlie popped the question

Nicola quit Made In Chelsea at the end of 2016 after more than a year on the show, following the breakdown of her romance with Alex Mytton.  

The former couple were an item for two years, after meeting in August 2014 while he was DJing in Ireland.

However, Nicola, who was once romantically linked to Cheryl's ex-husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, was left heartbroken when he ended their romance via text, while she was enjoying a family holiday in Florence, Italy. 

Cute: Nicola regularly shares sweet pictures with her beau Charlie on her social media since they started dating 

Happy: Nicola discussed her blossoming romance with Charlie in an interview with The Irish Independent two years ago, saying 'He's a very normal guy. He's a lovely guy'

Speaking to Hot Press magazine in 2018, Nicola said of their split: 'He cheated on me and it all kind of went spiralling downwards. Oh, God, I was devastated. Absolutely. I've had counselling about it.

'In extreme cases, when I broke up with my ex, I took tablets to calm me down. Or if I'm travelling I take some stuff to calm me down. I'm a really bad traveller – planes, tubes, sometimes in taxis. I don't like being in any confined space.

'I go to events regularly and they can make me panicky because I'm surrounded by loads of people. So, it's weird the job I do because I do suffer from that really badly.' 

Quality time: Charlie owns a recruitment company in the city and Nicola was a regular on E4 reality series Made In Chelsea

Nicola discussed her blossoming romance with Charlie in an interview with The Irish Independent two years ago, saying 'Charlie isn't in the reality world. 

'He's a very normal guy. He has a recruitment company in the city. He's a lovely guy,' she said.

'We've been going out for nearly nine months now, I think. We met through Alex. I was dating him after Alex and then we stopped for a while, but now we've started again. It's very nice.'
