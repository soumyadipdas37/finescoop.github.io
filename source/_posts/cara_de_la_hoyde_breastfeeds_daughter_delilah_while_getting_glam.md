She's now a mum of two after welcoming her daughter Delilah last month, a little sister for Freddie, two.

And Cara De La Hoyde, 30, has given her Instagram followers some candid updates on her new life over the bank holiday weekend.

The Love Island favourite shared a photo of herself breastfeeding her newborn as she got glam for a filming project on Monday, after telling her fans she had had a particularly tough week.

Cara was hard at work on Monday, telling fans she was filming a secret project with her husband Nathan Massey. 

The day started early for the reality star as she shared a photo of herself with clips in her hair and glam makeup on, while breastfeeding her little girl. 

'#mumlife never stops, off to film something exciting,' she captioned the candid phoot.

On Sunday Cara uploaded one of her regular updates on IGTV, sharing with fans that 'it's been a really tough week for everyone.'

Delilah had been suffering with colic, which Cara explained 'has got a lot better' thanks to cutting out certain food in her own diet including anything spicy and fizzy drinks.  

She also revealed she was hoping to start expressing some of her milk this week to 'see if that takes a bit of pressure off of me,' and so other family members can feed her newborn.

And while she said she was happy with Delilah's progress, Cara admitted it's been a struggle juggling toddler Freddie with her baby.  

A baby with colic cries a lot as well as clenching their fists, going bed in the face and arching their back.  

Health visitors and doctors will usually advise to:

Other remedies mothers hear about are anti-colic drops, herbal and probiotic supplements, changes to their diet if they're breastfeeding or applying gentle pressure to your baby's spine (spinal manipulation) or skull (cranial osteopathy).

But the NHS says there is little evidence for these so far.

'It's really stressful. He doesn't listen to anything I say. If I tell him off, he tells me off or scratches and pinches me. But then I don't really want to tell him off. He's not really a massive joy to be around at the moment,' she said.

'I don't want him to feel pushed out,' she admitted. 'I've sorted out the colic, and now it's one thing after another, this week has been very tiring.'

She ended her honest video by saying: 'Two kids, a whole new ballgame... Hopefully I don't end up murdering my child, or my husband, or maybe myself!'
