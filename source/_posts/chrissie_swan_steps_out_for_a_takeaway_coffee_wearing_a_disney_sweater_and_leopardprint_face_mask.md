She hosts one of Melbourne's most popular FM breakfast shows.

And on Wednesday, Chrissie Swan stepped out for a much needed caffeine fix in Melbourne.

The 46-year-old radio host was spotted picking up takeaway coffees in a leopard-print face mask amid the city's stage four lockdown restrictions.

The Australian television presenter appeared to have gone makeup-free for the outing.

She kept her long brunette locked pushed back behind her hair with a pair of designer sunglasses.

After parking her brown SUV on the street, Chrissie emerged from the vehicle and made her way into a nearby cafe.

It was a brief outing for the media personality, who then climbed back into her car and returned home.

The appearance comes just two days after Chrissie encouraged fellow Melburnians that they are 'almost there' on Instagram.

Victoria reported another five coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, taking the state toll to 771 and the national figure to 859, as new cases dropped to 15. 

On Monday, Chrissie marked a 'successful day' on social media after she revealed that she: 'Laughed at work, went for a walk, did the shopping and made a train salad.'

The former Channel 10 star completed her day drinking herbal tea, having a bath and reading a chapter of a new book.
