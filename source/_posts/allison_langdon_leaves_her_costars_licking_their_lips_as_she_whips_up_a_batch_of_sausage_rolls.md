Allison Langdon is known for her journalism skills and affable nature.  

And now the 41-year-old has proved she's also quite the master chef - attracting the attention of her Nine co-stars.

On Tuesday, Allison showed off her first-ever batch of homemade sausage rolls on Instagram. 

'Wow!' On Tuesday, the Today show's Allison Langdon left her co-stars licking their lips after she whipped up a tasty batch of homemade sausage rolls 

Allison was clearly proud of herself, as she wrote alongside the image: 'First attempt at sausage rolls - not bad hey??' 

It was clear from the comments, her fans liked what they saw, including her Channel Nine co-stars.  

Her Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic wrote, 'Wow', while wife Jasmine added, 'Go you', as words of encouragement. 

Meanwhile, Brooke Boney and entertainment guru Richard Wilkins asked Allison to bring one in to work for them.

It comes amid good new for Allison and her co-host Karl Stefanovic after they managed to beat competitor Sunrise in the ratings. 

Through the first eight days of September, Today has had more east coast viewers than Sunrise. 

On Monday, Today delivered its closest five-city metro result compared to Sunrise since Lisa Wilkinson was Karl's co-host in 2017.  

Before and after: Allison showed the sausage rolls before they went into the oven 

The show trailed in overall viewership by just 8,000. Flashback to the same Monday in May, and that gap was a whopping 94,000 people. 

It appears the light-hearted broadcast is appealing to viewers, with Karl and Ally breathing fresh air into the TV show. 

Earlier this month, Karl got into trouble for joking about Allison smelling like garlic.   

The pair were speaking to Dr Penny Adams about the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting sleep patterns. 

Ratings win: On Monday, Today delivered its closest five-city metro result compared to Sunrise since Lisa Wilkinson was Karl's co-host in 2017

Karl noted that many people were trying herbal medicines to switch off at night - including his co-host.

'Ally has got a liking for garlic which is unfortunate for the entire crew here at Channel Nine,' the 46-year-old hilariously noted.  

'It's a bit woofy this morning!' Karl quipped, before re-iterating: 'It's so woofy, it's not funny!'
