Kanye West has erected a large white wall around the ranch style church he has on his three-acre property in Calabasas Hills, California.

In new images, a pair of structures are seen completely closed in by the high walls in a section of the sprawling property, owned by the rapper and designer, 43, who is married to, Kim Kardashian, 39.

The Grammy-winning performer had previously built a set of dome structures in the same location last year, but Los Angeles County Department of Public Works officials ordered him to tear them down.

Problems arose from the project amid complaints from neighbouring residents who were rankled by the noise and traffic the construction of the domes attracted to the area.

'Cars everywhere, and it was obviously an imposition on everybody on the street with very little notice,' one neighbour of the rapper told KCAL. 

Authorities made the Bound 2 artist take down the domes – which Kanye drew inspiration from, referencing the fictional Star Wars planet Tatooine – in September of 2019, citing a lack of the required permits.

Kanye weighed the possibility of building the structures to help curb the homeless problem in his initial design.

Public works officials told CNN of the structures, 'It's the objective of our building officials to help property owners build in a way that protects public safety and is in compliance with state and county codes.

'This is a standard enforcement action for our office, and property owners are given ample time to comply with the order by either removing the unpermitted construction or submitting plans for approval and securing a building permit(s).'

The father-of-four, who shares North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, one, with wife Kim, eventually built the domes on property he owns in Wyoming with the reality star.

In an interview with Elle, Kim opened up about Kanye's motivation for putting on his Sunday Services, have travelled across the US – and even to Jamaica – in recent years.

'It’s honestly more like a healing experience for my husband,' she said of the music-based performances, which have become hugely popular.

'It’s just music; there’s no sermon. It’s definitely something he believes in — Jesus — and there’s a Christian vibe. But there’s no preaching. It’s just a very spiritual Christian experience.'

Kanye has reportedly been considering starting his own congregation, though it's not known if he'd seek to put on more overtly religious services if he made the jump.

Away from the Calabasas property, Kanye and his family live in a luxury home with their large brood.

Kanye and his family moved into a huge home near the Calabasas property last year, following almost four years of construction, during which they stayed with Kim's mother, Kris Jenner. 

Their estate has been a worthwhile investment, as sources told TMZ in 2018 that after spending $20 million on the changes – including expanding the home and landscaping the property – it was appraised at $60 million.

Among the amenities at the primary home are a music studio and a master bedroom. Other features on the 320-acre property, which was formerly owned by Lisa Marie Presley, include vineyards and multiple swimming pools.  

Kanye flew back to Los Angeles after spending several weeks at his Wyoming ranch and following a short trip to New York.

According to a source who spoke to People, the Runaway rapper 'really missed the kids and flew to see them.'

Although he put his newest album and his presidential campaign on hold, he reportedly plans on resuming the campaign, despite reports that it and his mental health struggles have put his marriage to Kim on shaky ground.

He has faced much scrutiny in recent months, after announcing a presidential run that was mired in controversy as he endured a very public meltdown, which included Twitter rants aimed at his mother-in-law Kris.

However, things appear to have settled among the family, after Kim and their children joined Kanye for a family break, which reportedly helped strengthen the couple's bond amid claims of marital woes.
