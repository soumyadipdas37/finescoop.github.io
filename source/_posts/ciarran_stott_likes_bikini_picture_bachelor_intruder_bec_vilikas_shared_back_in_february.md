He's at it again! Serial womaniser Ciarran Stott now has his eyes on Bachelor intruder Bec Cvilikas. The British lad has liked a bikini picture she shared back in February. 

In the photo, Bec flaunts her pert derriere in a g-string leopard print bikini bottoms paired with a white top as she soaks up the sun.

She looks stunning makeup free and her blonde luscious locks down.

Bec generated plenty of drama among the cast on Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor.

The remaining women admitted they felt threatened by her presence, and Roxi Kenny even insinuated she wasn't there for genuine reasons. 

But, former Survivor star Locky chose to keep Bec at the first post-lockdown rose ceremony.
