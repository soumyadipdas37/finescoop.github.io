According to The Sun, a TV insider said: 'Like the rest of the nation, Piers was in awe of Sir Tom's fundraising. 

'The campaign really took off after Tom appeared on Good Morning Britain, so Piers feels great pride in what Tom achieved.

'In the dark days of lock-down, it was everyday heroes, not celebs, who brought joy to the nation.

'So while it's normally scandalous figures who make the best episodes on his show, Piers knew Tom's extraordinary, inspiring story would be a big draw.'

In April, Piers Morgan donated £10,000 to Captain Tom Moore's 'magnificently inspiring' fundraising campaign for the NHS while he was live on Good Morning Britain.  

The then 99-year-old was walking laps of his garden to raise money for the NHS and eventually raised £32 million.

The GMB presenter said: 'Captain Tom Moore, thank you for serving your country. I'm so glad that we were able, through the brilliant NHS, to serve you back and keep you going.

'Good luck - I want to get you over the line today. Here's what I'm going to do, Tom, I'm going to put £10,000 of my own money into your fundraising today and I hope that encourages everyone watching at home to do the same.' 

Piers called for a knighthood for Captain Tom in April, before the war veteran received the honour from the Queen at Windsor Castle in July.   

The new series of Piers Morgans Life Stories will air tonight with former professional footballer Vinnie Jones as a returning guest.
