It's no secret that footy WAG Rebecca Judd loves Cadbury Caramilk.

And on Tuesday, the 37-year-old incorporated her favourite chocolate into a cupcake recipe while baking delicious treats for her four children.

Rebecca shared a clip of her three-year-old twin sons, Tom and Darcy, playing with the leftover cake mix in the bowl.

'Is there anything better?' she said, as her boys smeared their hands around the inside of the mixing bowl.

Rebecca then told her fans: 'We just made my standard cupcake recipe, but I've added a block of Caramilk chunks to see how it goes.' 

'I do have to taste test it first,' she added.

She has made no secret of her love of Caramilk, and in June excitedly revealed a friend had gifted her 10 blocks of it.

In November last year, she admitted she had been stockpiling the limited-edition chocolate bar, just in case supplies ran out. 

Fortunately for her, Cadbury Australia revealed the much-loved chocolate was 'coming back by popular demand'.
