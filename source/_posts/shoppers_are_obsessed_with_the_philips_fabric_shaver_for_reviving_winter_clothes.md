If you've taken out your winter jumpers and coats this weekend only to find that they're looking a little worse for wear with pills and bobbles, then you need a fabric shaver. 

And if you're not sure which one to pick, it might be worth following the 28,000 Amazon shoppers who have bought, and loved, the £11.42 Philips Fabric Shaver. 

Impressed customers have been sharing their before and after photos of the Phillips Fabric Shaver - and the results are seriously impressive. 

The bestselling Philips GC026/30 Fabric Shaver, which costs £11.42, quickly removes pills and bobbles on fabrics, helping them look like new 

Shaving off the pills, the Philips GC026/20 Fabric Shaver instantly revives garments and leaves them looking good as new. 

The gadget has impressed thousands of shoppers who describe it as 'fabulous' and 'an amazing gadget' that transforms clothes, bedding and throws.

The fabric shaver, which now costs less than £12 in the sale on Amazon, is an efficient way of removing annoying bobbles so your favourite clothes last longer. 

The affordable electric fabric shaver has a large surface with precision blades to quickly remove fuzz, lint, and pilling from almost any fabric. It's incredibly satisfying to use too. 

'Well, wow! It's good, it's very very good!' wrote one delighted shopper. 'I ran it lightly over the wool, backwards forwards, side to side and in circular motions, in next to no time I was done. My cardigan looks great, like new!'

Another customer wrote: 'After reading the many glowing reviews, and seeing the impressive before and after pictures, I knew I'd struck gold. Completely thrilled and over the moon with it. I literally cannot stop debobbling!!'

There are three sizes of holes in the shaving head of the Philips Fabric Shaver to tackle all sizes of bobbles

If you're worried about the shaver damaging delicate or more expensive items then the height adjustable cap should put your mind at rest. You can change the setting to suit the fabric, which helps to ensure delicates don't get damaged.

Plus, it has been designed with three sizes of holes in the mesh head, which is a clever feature shoppers found super efficient at removing different sizes of bobbles - especially the larger piling on blankets and throws.  

With garments feeling brand new after the fabric shaver has done its work, plenty of shoppers have agreed that the Philips Fabric Shaver has saved them a fortune, reviving clothes that were destined for the bin.   

'This product works! I have already saved 4 jumpers since getting it 24 hours ago,' wrote one shopper in their review on Amazon.  

Another added: 'Amazing gadget that will save you a fortune in unnecessary clothing purchases, get one now!'
