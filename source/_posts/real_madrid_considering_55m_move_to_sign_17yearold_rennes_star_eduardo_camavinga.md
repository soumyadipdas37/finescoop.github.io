Real Madrid are reportedly plotting a move for up-and-coming Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga this summer with the prime motivation of ensuring no other top European club buys him. 

Camavinga has broken into the first-team with the Ligue 1 club and has earned plaudits with his performances at the age of 17. 

French champions PSG, who lost their season-opener on Thursday, are also eyeing a deal but Madrid could submit a £55m (€60m) bid for Camavinga, with the intention of loaning him back to Rennes for a season or two, according to Spanish outlet Diario Sport.

The report details that Rennes would be encouraged by a financial incentive to sell the 17-year-old alongside playing a part in his continued development for the next two years. 

The midfielder started 24 Ligue 1 matches last season as he helped his side overachieve and claim a Champions League qualification spot. 

More significantly however, Camavinga was handed his senior France debut last week, when he featured against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. 

That appearance made him the youngest French international in more than 100 years.

'I would not say no to Camavinga,' said PSG boss Thomas Tuchel earlier this week. 

He is one of the best players in Ligue 1 and has a good future.' 

Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane could play a huge role in persuading Camavinga that his long-term future should be at the Bernabeu, as two of Europe's biggest clubs get set to go head-to-head for one of European football's rising talents.
