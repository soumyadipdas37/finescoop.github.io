Luke Hemsworth has candidly revealed that he had to learn to get in touch with his emotions to be a better father.  

The 39-year-old and wife Samantha have been married for 13 years and together share four children: daughters Holly, 11, Ella, 10, and eight-year-old Harper Rose, as well as seven-year-old son Alexandre. 

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph on Sunday, the Westworld actor admitted: 'I have had to learn to be expressive. It was never okay to be emotional as a bloke. I feel like it is changing.

'There is an inherent attitude that men should be men and that we don't feel sad and doubtful and vulnerable and all that stuff.'

He confessed that attitude sometimes made it hard to relate to his young children. 

'I have days where I think my children are aliens, I want nothing to do with them. Part of that is admitting that that is okay as well.

'It doesn't make me love them less but also sometimes I can't help but think, what I am doing is affecting them negatively,' Luke said.

The star who spent almost a decade living in Los Angeles, recently moved to Byron Bay to be closer to his parents, Leonie and Craig, and brothers Liam and Chris.

'It's a better quality of life, for sure,' Luke told Stellar magazine. 'We had to make a decision about the kids, because if we'd stayed in LA and Westworld went into Season Four, then we'd be locked in for another couple of years.'

He continued: 'It's best for the kids. Mum and Dad can walk to the house, Chris is about a mile away, and I think Liam's going to be there soon, too.

'The kids are outside in bare feet, they're on the beach and not watching much TV at all any more.'   

Luke is also the eldest sibling of his famous Hemsworth brothers - Chris, 37, and Liam, 30.

Back in April 2018, Luke spoke candidly to The Daily Telegraph about his personal life differs from his superstar brothers.

'I worry about the loss of anonymity, which is the one thing Chris and Liam would want back,' he told the publication.

Luke is next set to star in the Australian road trip film Bosch & Rockit, about a father and son running from the law.
