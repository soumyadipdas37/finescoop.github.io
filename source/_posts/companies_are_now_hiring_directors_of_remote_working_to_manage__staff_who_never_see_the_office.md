Companies are now seeking specialist bosses to manage the armies of eployees who work solely from home amid the coronavirus lockdown. 

Although working remotely seemed to be a temporary solution during the pandemic, jobs website Adzuna suggests it could be here to stay with vacancies for positions including 'head of remote' and 'director of home working'. 

And this new demand for remote managers is expected to increase as more companies opt for hiring remote staff, according to Adzuna.

Data shows that vacancies for remote roles have risen by 147 per cent since last year, with 47,300 job ads being for a remote position.  

The IT sector is among the first ones  with 15,400 remote jobs on offer at present, and an average salary of £51,300, followed by the customer services sector with adverts for remote workers accounting for 32.7 per cent of roles offered, with an average salary of £20,500, according to the Times. 

With Boris Johnson urging people to work from home when possible, Andrew Hunter, the co-founder of Adzuna, said that 'remote working is 'here to stay'.

He added: 'Remote working is here to stay, but remote job opportunities have a way to go to catch-up.

'Nine out of 10 job openings fail to specify if a role is remote and may be missing out on applications from cautious jobseekers nervous about returning to the office.

'IT is leading the charge, accounting for a third of overall remote job opportunities, helped by a sector full of early-adopters and technical pioneers, but blue-collar job hunters have far fewer remote opportunities to choose from.

'There is an inequality issue here and we must question whether enough is being done to protect lower-skilled, lower-paid workers forced to put themselves at risk to find work.'
