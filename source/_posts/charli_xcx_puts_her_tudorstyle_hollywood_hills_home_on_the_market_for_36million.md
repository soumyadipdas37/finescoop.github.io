Charli XCX is selling her stunning 1920s home in the Hollywood Hills fives years after splashing out on her first LA home.

The British singer has put her Tudor-style abode on the market for $3.6 million after snapping up the charming home for $2.8million in 2015. 

Built in 1927, the house has since been restored and updated with many modern features but retains the Tudor-style details including beams and vast fireplaces.

Located in the city’s Beachwood area, the historic house is part of the gated communities below the Hollywood sign, that started construction in 1923 and was once known as Hollywoodland. 

The three storey abode boasts four bedrooms, four bathrooms and lavish details including floor-to-ceiling diamond-paned windows, hand-carved dark wood doors and tudor-style beams.

Adding to the period vibe are three brick fireplaces dotted around the house, while the stunning master suite includes canted ceilings and a statement chandelier.

The main living room boasts a huge fireplace leading up to the wood panelled, vaulted ceiling. Wood floors add to the cosy vibe while lights floods in through a vast black framed window with views out to the terrace.

The kitchen is decorated in fresh white, with cabinets offset by stone worktops, while all the modcons are included.

The entrance hall has all the period details with a vast wooden staircase taking pride of place. Meanwhile the lower level of the house boasts its own entrance to a movie theater, perfect for hang outs.

Last year Charli gave a tour of her home to Architectural Digest, explaining how she'd redecorated the home to add pops of colour and show off her creative side.

Explaining what attracted her to the house, the singer admitted: 'It’s funny that I moved across the world and still ended up in an archetype of a British house.'

'I liked that this was an old place and immediately loved it. I love the dark wood. I love that it’s a little creepy and weird. It just felt really right for me.'

The singer moved into the house after relocating from London to LA in 2015, inviting three childhood friends from the UK to live with her. 

She told AD that she loved to use the house for work and living, explaining: 'I use my house for everything. We work here and we do shoots.'

'We throw a lot of parties here—well, we used to throw more parties. I just like the house to feel busy; I like that this house has just seen a lot of stories and fun things happen.'

The house is not the only residence Charli is off-loading, as she put her newly-refurbished Victorian terraced house in Chelsea, London on the market for £2.35million last month. 

Cosy: The main living room includes huge comfy couches and a fluffy rug, while diamond windows let in the light

Get to work: Charli used the house for both work and living, with the house also boasting a smart office 

Modern and period: The stunning, one of a kind house has retained much of its original features while Charli has put her own creative twist on the interiors

Creative: Keen art-collector Charli has decorated the house with some of her pieces while books and games are dotted throughout

The property, built in 1891, was recently completely renovated by the Break The Rules songstress, 28 - who maintained many of the house's classic features while adding her own clean and contemporary twist.

Cambridge-born Charli XCX - whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison - is understood to have spent lockdown with boyfriend Huck Kwong in Los Angeles, during which she created 11-song album Guernica.

The couple have dated since 2014, but have been friends with one another since 2012.

She recently revealed she and boyfriend Huck were about to break up because they barely saw each other before the global pandemic. 

But their decision to live together during quarantine helped to save their relationship, and made her realise she can 'trust [Huck] with [her] life.'

Making the most of the LA sunshine: Meanwhile outside, there's more room for socialising on the huge deck, on which sits a hot tub, with views of the lush gardens

Privacy: There's pretty dining areas outside on the deck, with greenery helping to keep the house private, perfect for the celeb owner

Speaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music, she explained: 'You know, we were, I'm not going to say like at the end of the road, but close to it.

'We were living on separate sides of the country even though we were physically far apart, we were emotionally quite distant as well. 

'And this time period, I'm extremely lucky that it has brought us physically close together because now we're living in the same house but also emotionally, and I finally understand that this person is somebody who I can trust with my life and I will have my security and protection at the front point of their heart no matter what.'
