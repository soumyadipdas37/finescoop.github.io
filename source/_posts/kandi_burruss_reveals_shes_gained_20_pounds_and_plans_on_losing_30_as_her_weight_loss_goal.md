Kandi's candid Instagram post comes one day after her RHOA co-star Cynthia Bailey faced cruel criticism after they shared a snap of herself wearing a crop top with matching bottoms.  

The 53-year-old reality star was the subject of scrutiny with users telling her to 'lose weight,' but Bailey quickly corrected the criticism and confirmed that her fiance Mike Hill 'ain't complaining' about her figure.

What started as a positive post about her long braids created by Adorning Impact, quickly took a sour note when users began commenting on her body. 

'Lose Some Weight,' Instagram user @ryee787 wrote about an hour after Bailey posted the snap.

Cynthia quickly commented back: '@tsmikehill ain't complaining.'

Queen: Cynthia Bailey made sure the cruel trolls online knew that their words couldn't hurt her feelings after sharing a photo dressed in a linen crop top with matching slacks on Monday

Another user, @molnar1234, wrote that the model seemed to have 'gained the covid15.'

Bailey took the comment in stride and reassured the online troll that she, in fact, gained more: 'actually the Covid-20.'

Fans of the RHOA star lent their support as they bashed the users for negative commentary.

One follower wrote: 'WTF... so inappropriate!! Get a life.'

Instagram user mstiffiswinning came out to defend Bailey and wrote: '@ryee787 quit hating on another beautiful black woman. That was mean and bitter of your miserable self. She looks great.'

Bailey spoke with Us Weekly last month where she admitted to gaining weight while under quarantine due to the pandemic, but was re-focusing her efforts to shed a few of the pounds before her wedding.

'I actually gained 20 pounds from the quarantine and my wedding dress designers were not happy about that because now I can’t fit [in] my dress,' she said.

Cynthia and Mike, 50, have been engaged for a year and are set to become husband and wife later this year.
