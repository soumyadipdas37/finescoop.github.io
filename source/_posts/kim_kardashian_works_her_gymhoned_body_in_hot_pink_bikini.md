'Happy place', Kim captioned the photo series, which saw her walking along the sand with her gym-honed physique on full display.

The star styled her hair into two long pigtails which cascaded far past her chest, while using a smoky hue of eye shadow and bronze blush to amplify her features.

The first snap caught Kim lounging seductively in her infinity pool with the waves crashing just a stone's throw away.

In another snap, Kim playfully stuck out her tongue towards the camera.

The fourth and final snippet from the slideshow was a brief clip of Kim lounging at the edge of the pool.

As Kim turned her head, she seductively raised her knee out of the water.

Kim was spotted on the beaches of Cabo earlier this month taking these photos, which are said to be for her KWW beauty range.   

The shoot occurred amid a tumultuous time for Kim and her husband Kanye West, who have been embroiled in marital drama since his wild presidential rally in South Carolina.

The couple, who share daughters North, seven, Chicago, two, and sons Saint, four, and Psalm, 14 months, subsequently headed to the Caribbean in a reported bid to save their marriage amid his bipolar struggles.  

Meanwhile, it was recently revealed that Kanye is keen on purchasing another ranch in Wyoming, where he already spends much of his time working. 

The Bound 2 rapper is reportedly interested in purchasing the Double Doc Ranch in Cody, Wyoming after visiting it the other day.

The ranch, which operates as a horse breeding and training facility, is already home to three horses owned by the Kardashian-West family, TMZ reports.

Kanye's wife Kim previously revealed he wants to move to Wyoming but her law studies mean they can't just yet.

Kim must remain a resident of California so she can sit the state bar exam there in 2024. She said at the time: 'I know that my husband wants to move to Wyoming, but I love California.'

'Honestly, the sky, the air, everything is different in Wyoming. I love it. It's a happy place for me, and my sisters, we all want to get a ranch there. We just did a cattle drive down there. It's been amazing.'

However, she is currently based in Los Angeles.
