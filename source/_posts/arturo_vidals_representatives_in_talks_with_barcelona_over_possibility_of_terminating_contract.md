Arturo Vidal's agents have entered talks with Barcelona's board over the possibility of terminating his contract.

Vidal's deal runs until the end of June next year, but he is eager to leave the club. 

As reported by Sky Sport Italia, Inter Milan are leading the race to sign Vidal, with Antonio Conte rating the Chile international highly.

Vidal made 43 appearances last season, scoring eight goals, but he is one of a host of players who could depart as Barcelona look to overhaul their squad.

The 33-year-old has been vocal in his criticism of Barcelona, criticising the club for being too reliant on Lionel Messi and having too many youth products in the first-team. He slammed the club fro having just '13 professional players'.

Vidal told Daniel Habif's YouTube channel: 'Barcelona have to change their way of thinking. Football has moved on a lot and the [whole] DNA [thing] is being left behind because other teams are improving in other aspects: football at the moment is more physical, more dependent on power and speed and the technical side is sometimes less important.

'The last three years are not what a team like Barcelona deserves. The best team in the world cannot have 13 professional players. You cannot always win with DNA.' 

Vidal joined Barcelona from Bayern Munich in 2018 and has played 96 times for the club. 

He won the LaLiga title during his first season, but last season was hugely frustrating for Barcelona as they failed to win a trophy. 

There is much uncertainty at Barcelona at present, with new manager Ronald Koeman overseeing an overhaul of the squad, while the club are also dealing with the high-profile issue of Messi's desire to leave the club.
