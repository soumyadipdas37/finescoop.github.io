Melbourne AFL player Harley Bennell is under investigation for breaching coronavirus rules by going drinking outside the team's hub.

The Demons reported the midfielder's potential breach on Saturday night to the AFL after becoming aware of it.

Melbourne is still investigating but it is believed Bennell hit a pub outside the Twin Waters resort in Maroochydore, where the team is staying.

Bennell, 27, was told to stay outside the hub to avoid any possibility of him infecting other players inside the hotel.

Recruited from Fremantle this offseason, he only played fives games this season and was still in quarantine.

He was left out of the team's 68-49 victory over Essendon on Saturday that kept its finals hopes alive. 

The AFL warned players they could be fined $10,000 and sent home from the postseason if they breached league coronavirus rules.

Richmond players Callum Coleman-Jones and Sydney Stack were last month sent home and suspended for 10 weeks after a fight outside a Gold Coast strip club.

Bennell was a solid staring if unspectacular player for the Gold Coast in 2011-15, but played just just two games in four seasons with Fremantle.

He was expected the get a new contract with Melbourne after his one-year deal expired despite barely playing.

Bennell's career was marred by a series of off-field indiscretions including a disorderly conduct charge for drunkenly arguing with security guard outside a Gold Coast nightclub in 2015.
