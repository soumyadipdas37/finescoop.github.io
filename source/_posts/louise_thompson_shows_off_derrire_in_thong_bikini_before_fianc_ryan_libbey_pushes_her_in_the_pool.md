Louise Thompson took to Instagram to tease her pert behind on Thursday, as she continues to enjoy a sun-drenched vacation abroad.

The reality star, 30, showed off her honed frame in a black thong bikini, posing in sunglasses by the side of a pool.

She also uploaded a video of her fiancé Ryan Libbey filming her in the same pose, before pushing her into the pool with his foot.

This appeared to confirm all is well in their romance, after she shared a cryptic tweet referring to cheating earlier in the day.

The former Made In Chelsea star, who has been engaged to personal trainer Ryan for two years, took to Twitter to share a message with her 520,700 followers reading: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful'.

But things seemed fine between the betrothed, as she scolded Ryan playfully as they laughed about the pool-pushing.

All good: She also shared a snap of Ryan with her brother Sam Thompson a mere few hours before

She joked that she'd just washed her hair too, with her drenched mane sopping wet in the video, her sunglasses floating in the water.

Having shot to fame on MIC in 2011, Louise became part of a central storyline due to her romance with love rat Spencer Matthews, leading to speculation from fans that the tweet could have been about her ex.

The star did not provide any clarity over who she was referencing in her message. MailOnline has contacted Louise's representative for comment.  

In April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.

The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December.

In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'At the beginning it wasn't that easy but we've had to make a really conscious effort to make some changes.

'We are actively working on our relationship now. For the first couple of years in a relationship you're still in that love phase, there are still new things to experience. 

We've been together for four and a half years now and you do go through phases. You have to try a bit harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.

'We are communicating more and having chats about what each other wants, so now we have set some boundaries.'

The pair had booked to marry at London's Kew Gardens in December 2019 but cancelled their plans, with Louise saying: 'It's just the bigger picture for myself and Ryan that we need to get to grips with first.'

Months later, Ryan revealed they had agreed on a venue in Ibiza for their wedding to go ahead in spring 2020 – but now Louise says they're still 'figuring out what it is we want' and their plans have come to a halt.

She said: 'No… actually, we haven't, we are still sort of figuring out what it is we want to do because we're so busy with the business.

'I am someone that really wants to have the best day ever and I want to be in the right space, I am just not sure exactly what I want yet.'
