Carole Baskin went from Tiger King to The Lion King on Monday during Disney Night on Dancing With The Stars.

The 59-year-old big-cat rights activist became the second star to be eliminated after a weak samba with pro partner Pasha Pashkov, 35, to Circle Of Life from Disney's 1994 animated film The Lion King.

Carole and Pasha wore top-notch lion costumes and full hair and makeup to add leonine features, but stiff dancing landed them at the bottom of the leaderboard with just 12 points out of a possible 30 for their routine.

They faced elimination along with Anne Heche, 51, and her 30-year-old pro partner Keo Motsepe who earned 15 points for their quickstep to the song Zero To Hero from the 1999 Disney animated film Hercules.

New judge Derek Hough, 35, who voted to save Carole last week, could not do the same this week and cast his ballot to eliminate her.

He was joined by judge Bruno Tonioli, 64, who lodged the deciding vote sending Carole home.

Carrie Ann Inaba, 52, revealed to new host Tyra Banks, 46, that she also would have voted to eliminate Carole, but her tie-breaking vote wasn't needed.

'My husband will be so happy that I'm coming home,' Carole said after being eliminated.

Carole has been married to Howard Baskin since 2004 and they run the Big Cat Rescue animal sanctuary near Tampa, Florida with her as CEO and him as secretary/treasurer.

The big-cat activist got emotional in a video package showing her preparing for her samba with Pasha.

Carole praised Disney films for featuring animals 'living free' and noted that any wild cat born in a cage can't be released back into the wild because they were raised around people.

'On the sanctuary, we don't breed big cats because we know they don't belong in cages,' she said. 'Were gonna make their lives better than they have ever been before.

She fought back tears while adding, 'Yet at the same time, I know I can't give them the one thing they really, really want. And that is their freedom.'

Their samba routine opened with the familiar Zulu vocals from Circle Of Life and striking African savanna imagery, but the dancing didn't reach the level of their detailed costumes and staging.

'I am stunned. I actually have never, ever seen a samba like this one. I don't know where to begin. But, if you were dancing with the Brooklyn Bridge, you could get more bounce, you know. You just walked through it. Samba needs life, bounce, and energy. You can't just sleepwalk through a samba. I'm sorry, but that's what I feel, my love,' Bruno said before awarding them just three points.

Carrie Ann saluted Carole for the 'love' that she put into the dance, while Derek praised their hair and makeup.
