Victoria's chief health officer has revealed he did not recommend Melbourne's crippling curfew but premier Daniel Andrews imposed it anyway.

Under some of the toughest coronavirus restrictions in the world, five million Melbourne residents are not allowed out of their homes between 9pm and 5am.

Professor Brett Sutton today revealed the curfew was not based on medical advice but was brought in as the government declared a state of disaster on August 2, on the advice of the emergency management commissioner.

Previously a state of emergency was in place which did not give the government as much power to enforce restrictions.

'The curfew came in as part of the state of disaster... it wasn't a state of emergency requirement,' Professor told Melbourne radio station 3AW.

'It wasn't something that I was against from a public health perspective. 

'I was consulted on it but it was a separate decision-making pathway.'

Asked for his view on the curfew, Professor Sutton said: 'I haven't reflected on it, I think it has been useful. If I put my mind to it, probably.' 

Later in the interview, Professor Sutton denied any rumours that he had fallen out with Mr Andrews and said: 'We've worked very well together.'

'I get along pretty well with all sorts hopefully across the political spectrum and across all the various personality types,' he said.

'My gig is to provide straight up robust advice.

'I'm pretty comfortable with giving it, maybe when it's not comfortably received.' 

On Tuesday Victoria reported eight more coronavirus deaths and new cases rose slightly to 55.

Under Mr Andrews' road map to easing restrictions, released on Sunday, lockdown will only end when there are an average of five cases per day, which is not expected in Melbourne until October 26. 

Until then, a curfew will be in place from 9pm to 5am and residents can only leave home for exercise, shopping, school and work, and caregiving. 

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the road map was a 'worst-case scenario' plan and should be sped up.

But Mr Andrews said in a press conference on Tuesday: 'I'd say to the prime minister, the worst-case scenario is being open for three or four weeks and then closed down again. That's the worst-case scenario. Absolutely that's the worst-case scenario.'

He added: 'I will continue to work closely with the prime minister and his team. We're grateful for the partnership that we have, but in my judgment, if I can be so bold as to have a judgment on these things, I think I've got some insight into what's happening here in our state.

'The worst-case scenario is you're open for three or four weeks because you pretend it's over ... and then we're all back locked down again.

'There would be 15 minutes of happiness and then we'd be back in lockdown and arguably facing an even worse situation than we face now.' 

Step one: The first step will come in to place on September 13.

Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. 

Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.

Step four: The move to step four will come when there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on November 23.
