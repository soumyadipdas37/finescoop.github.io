On November 7, 2010, we suggested that policemen AZ12 and AZ14 had deliberately quoted song titles in evidence to the inquest  of Chelsea barrister Mark Saunders. Since then the Independent Police Complaints Commission has found this was not the case. 

We accept neither officer showed disrespect for the deceased, his family or the Court and apologise for any distress caused.
