He split from actress Lily James nine months ago, having previously dated model Daisy Lowe, the daughter of rock star Gavin Rossdale. 

Screen star Matt was also romantically linked to Karen Gillan, his co-star when he was Doctor Who between 2010 and 2013.

He met Lily a year later on the set of the film Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, but they split amid rumours of his close friendship with Claire Foy, who starred opposite him as the Queen in The Crown.

By comparison, Emilia – who was named Esquire magazine’s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015 – has had an uncomplicated love life. 

She recently split from director and writer Charlie McDowell, the son of actor Malcolm McDowell and US actress Mary Steenburgen. 

She previously dated Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the US animated comedy Family Guy.
