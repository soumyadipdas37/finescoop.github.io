If you're looking for a purple toning conditioner that actually works, then you'll want to add Bold Uniq Purple Conditioner to your haircare routine.

The top-rated product has a dedicated fan base on Amazon having amassed more than 24,000 ratings, with over 70 per cent of these shoppers awarding it a full five stars. Reviewers describe the purple conditioner as the perfect solution for cancelling out brassy or yellow hues from their locks in as little as one use.

They say the Bold Uniq Purple Conditioner 'delivers what it promises', that it's 'by far the best purple toner on the market', and it 'works so much faster than any other toners'.

Formulated with violet pigments, this trusty bottle of purple conditioner has earned a cult following for its ability to work miracles on bleached, blonde and grey hair, counteracting the brass and cooling and toning your hair colour.

'This stuff is amazing!' one reviewer wrote. 'I bleached my hair and still had a few orange tones; I put this straight on for 15 minutes, and they were gone!'

'Did exactly what it said on the bottle,' another reviewer added. 'Amazing product. Totally neutralised the brassiness and added shine.' 

Other customers commented that the shampoo is a great way to refresh or enhance your current hair colour without dyeing it. 

One wrote in their review: 'For the first time in my life I decided to use purple shampoo because my blonde turned brassy after last balayage and vacation.

The Bold Uniq Purple Conditioner , which costs £19.95, can be used on its own (once or twice a week), alternating with your regular conditioner

'After reading many reviews, I decided to buy the Bold Uniq. I used it, leaving it on my hair for three minutes, and the effect is exactly as I expected - my blondes have regained their platinum shades, my hair is incredibly soft. Great product, I recommend it!'

Not only does the shampoo dramatically lengthen the time between dye appointments, but it replenishes dry, damaged hair too. It's also vegan-friendly and cruelty and sulfate-free, so there's no need to worry about damaging or stripping your hair of its natural oils.

The Bold Uniq Purple Conditioner, which costs £19.95, can be used on its own (once or twice a week), alternating with your regular conditioner. Just don't leave it on for longer than suggested, or you might find yourself with purple-hued highlights.
