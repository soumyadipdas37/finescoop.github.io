Apple was rumored to announce its Apple Watch Series 6 and a new iPad Air Tuesday, but instead the world received news of the event that could unveil its next-gen iPhone.

The tech giant’s website shared a new post in its upcoming event section that reads, ‘Join us from Apple Park. September 15, 2020, at 10am PDT.’

Although no context was included about the reason for the event, Apple typically reveals the latest smartphone around this time – previous years saw it happen on September 12.

The firm is expected to announced four new iPhones this year that boast new designs and sharper edges around the corners.

Apple was rumored to have something great in-store for the public today and the hashtag 'appleevent' began trending on Twitter early Tuesday morning with thousands anticipating the big reveal. 

Well-known leaker Jon Prosser said Apple was set to announce a new Apple Watch Series 6 and iPad Air Tuesday.

Other clues also revealed the same rumor – some countries had removed the Apple Watch Series 5 from the website or no stock was available for purchase.  

However, Mark Gurman from Bloomberg had previously said not to get too excited and the announcement may just be the date of the firm’s traditional iPhone unveiling event.

Gurman suggests all of the products will be showcased at one event, which has been the way of Apple for many years.
