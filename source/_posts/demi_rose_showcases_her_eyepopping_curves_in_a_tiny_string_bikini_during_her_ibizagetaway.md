Her recent post comes after the model emotionally discussed losing both her parents at the age 24 and how she copes with her ongoing grief.

She appeared on Sky News on Thursday to talk to Kay Burley in a bid to raise mental health awareness on World Suicide Prevention Day.

Demi lost her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, and she went on to suffer another devastating loss as her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.  

Discussing losing both her parents at just 24-years-old, the model said: 'Well, my mother, when I was 17, she had a heart attack which caused a stroke and it left her disabled.

'Then in 2018, my dad passed away from cancer, then my mum, after being sick for so long, she passed away from a stomach infection. So it was really hard.'

When asked how she copes with the grief, Demi said: 'I mean, it was really difficult, I've gone through stages of feeling my worst and now I'm at a place where I feel a lot better. It just takes time really.'  

'I have some amazing friends and I do meditation. I have a lot of faith, so I pray and do sound healing. I love sound healing.'
