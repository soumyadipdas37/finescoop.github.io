Iggy Azalea welcomed baby boy Onyx Carter earlier this year.

And it seems the little one is already quite the traveler, seen flying out of LAX with his rapper mom and a nanny on Sunday.

The Fancy hitmaker's pride and joy looked absolutely adorable while relaxing in a chic Fendi stroller during what was the first look at the little dude's face.

Oh boy! Iggy Azalea and her baby boy Onyx were seen at LAX on Saturday. There, the little one's face was seen for the first time

So sweet: He looked absolutely adorable while hanging out in a Fendi stroller wearing a little bucket hat

Iggy was seen stepping out of a black SUV as she arrived at the airport with her baby boy.

The Australian rapper was dressed comfortably and casually in a pair of cream-colored sweatpants decorated with lovely floral designs.

She also carried along a matching sweatshirt with text on the back, but likely left it off due to the LA heat, and she had a matching T-shirt on with the same design.

The 5ft10in songwriter sported voluminous blonde curls that shone in the sunlight, and she rounded out her ensemble with a pair of simple white sneakers.Â
