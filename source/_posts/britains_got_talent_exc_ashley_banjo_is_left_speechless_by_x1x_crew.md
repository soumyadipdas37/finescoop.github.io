Ashley Banjo was left speechless when dance group X1X crew performed during the third Britain's Got Talent semi-final.

In an exclusive clip from Saturday night's episode, the Diversity star, 31, looked on in amazement as they performed death-defying tricks remotely from India.

The dance troupe, who are from Mumbai, were seen jumping from great heights, doing flips high in the air before landing perfectly on their feet, and doing fun gymnastics routines.

Amanda Holden was also left aghast as the dance crew formed human pyramids of varying sizes as one member jumped on their backs before doing a kick flip.

The impressive jumps led to a synchronised dance number that culminated in several flips into the air and on the tall trampoline they had set up.

But that wasn't all, as one dancer began revving up a motorbike, before another crew member did a flip and landed onto the back of the vehicle with apparent ease.

Wow! Ashley looked in amazement as they performed death-defying tricks remotely from India

Ashley could be heard laughing in amazement over the trick, before he stood up and watched with a delighted smile on his face as another dancer did a flip from the tall trampoline and into the group below. 

X1X were required to perform from India, as travel restrictions and quarantine measures meant they could not make the journey to the UK for the live shows. 

The live shows - which typically air over the course of a week in late May and early June - were postponed in March due to the coronavirus crisis, with only the pre-recorded auditions able to air as planned.

On Thursday, OfCom announced they will not investigate Diversity's Black Lives Matter-inspired routine from Britain's Got Talent on September 5, despite viewer complaints soaring to 24,500 by last count that morning.

The performance has now become the second-most complained about television moment of the decade, but a spokesperson for the government-approved regulatory body has confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken.  

The representative said: 'We carefully considered a large number of complaints about this artistic routine, an area where freedom of expression is particularly important.

Delighted: Amanda Holden was also left amazed by the troupe's performance

'Diversity's performance referred to challenging and potentially controversial subjects, and in our view, its central message was a call for social cohesion and unity. 

'Any depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation – but rather a message that the lives of black people matter.'

Troupe leader Ashley reacted to the news on Instagram as he shared the statement and penned: 'Creativity is always a leap of faith. All I did what was what felt right and I’d do it 100 times over... Sending love to everyone that stood by us'. 

Britain’s Got Talent continues tonight at 20:00 on ITV.
