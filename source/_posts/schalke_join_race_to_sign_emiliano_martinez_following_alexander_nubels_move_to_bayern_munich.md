Schalke have joined the race to sign Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, according to reports.

The 27-year-old has shone for the Gunners in recent months following an injury to Bernd Leno, keeping nine clean sheets in 23 games last season after the Premier League restart.

The Argentine was also in goal on Saturday for Arsenal's Community Shield victory against Liverpool on penalties at Wembley.

But Sky Sports report that Bundesliga outfit Schalke are now interested in signing Martinez having lost the talented Alexander Nubel to Bayern Munich on a free transfer.

However, the report adds the German side are in financial difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic and have already allowed midfielder Weston McKennie to join Juventus.

Reports in Germany have also suggested the Bundesliga outfit are looking to re-sign Martinez's Gunners team-mate Sead Kolasinac on loan with an option to buy. 

The news regarding Martinez however comes after Sportsmail revealed on Saturday that Marcelo Bielsa's Leeds United are also tracking Martinez.

The Leeds boss is a confirmed admirer of his fellow Argentinian who has interest from up to ten clubs.

Arsenal are willing to listen to offers for the 27-year-old and Bielsa is in the market with Leeds willing to offload Kiko Casilla, who has been prone to making errors at Elland Road.

Martinez has two years left on his deal at the Emirates Stadium and has stated in no uncertain terms his desire to see regular first-team action this season. 

The Mirror however claim that Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is now desperate to keep the Argentine following his rich vein of form.
