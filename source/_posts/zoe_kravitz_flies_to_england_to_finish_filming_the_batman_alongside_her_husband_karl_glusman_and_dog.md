In order to finish filming The Batman, Zoë Kravitz brought along her husband, Greyhound star Karl Glusman, and dog Scout to catch a flight to England out of JFK Airport in New York on Monday.

The 31-year-old nepotistically-privileged daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet sipped from a glass bottle while clad in a blue tank top, brown pants, and black boots from The Row.

Zoë and the Bronx-born 32-year-old - who celebrated their first wedding anniversary on June 29 - wore KN-95 masks, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made mandatory for public outings way back on April 15.
