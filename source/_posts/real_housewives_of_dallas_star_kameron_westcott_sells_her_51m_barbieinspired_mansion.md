Real Housewives of Dallas' star Kameron Westcott has sold her stunning $5.1M pink-filled mansion in Dallas' prestigious Highland Park neighborhood. 

While she has worked hard to transform herself into a real-life Barbie over the years, her affinity for the doll clearly transcended to her home's interior, as just about every room had a pop of pink. 

Kameron, who says 'just because I look like Barbie doesn't mean you can play me' in her RHOD season four tagline, has previously shared glimpses of her Louboutin-lined closets and entirely pink office on social media and on her hit reality show.

The 37-year-old Bravo star and her husband, Court Westcott, put their unique 7,409 square foot five-bedroom, six-bathroom and two-half-bathroom home on the market in May.

After more than a decade of living in the home they built as newlyweds, the pair announced they were 'ready for a change,' according to the Westcott's realtor and longtime friend, Kelli Macatee. 

'This has been a treasured home for them for over 10 years, but like all of us, they're ready for a change,' Macatee told Page Six in May, while confirming they still plan on staying in the area. 'Because of that, someone is going to get a fabulous home.' 

'Kameron has built a pink empire in this house that everyone loves to escape into for just a minute to be refreshed from this crazy world,' Macatee told People  

Wow! While she has worked hard to transform herself into a real-life Barbie over the years, her affinity for the doll transcended to the home's interior, as just about every room had a pop of pink

As for the home's inspirations, Kameron wanted to pay homage to her Santa Barbara roots with a 'fresh, airy and seamless flow of indoor and outdoor living in the residence.' 

The reality star's signature shade was heavily incorporated throughout the property, including an office near the entrance painted in pink, a portrait of Marilyn Monroe blowing a bubble in the dining area and vases of bright flowers. 

The pictures also give close-ups of a number of different spots in the home, which are decked out in blush and cotton candy hues, including a neon piece of art, which reads: 'wink' in the kitchen. 

Stunning: In addition to the home's high-end amenities, it is complete with fireplace, pool and a fully finished basement

The realtor noted that is the home 'they brought babies into, the home they built businesses in, the home they built friendships in, the home they lived life in' during an interview with People

'Kameron has built a pink empire in this house that everyone loves to escape into for just a minute to be refreshed from this crazy world,' Macatee told People. 'I know they are excited for what the future holds and will now build memories into the walls and foundation of a new home in the Dallas area.' 

The property, designed by architect Will Snyder and built by George Lewis in 2008, includes an elevator, a movie theater and a wine cellar.

Other custom touches include an expansive white kitchen and a backyard designed for entertaining guests with multiple seating arrangements, overhead fans, a retractable screen, playhouse and a slide. 

Kameron’s former office contains a secret storage closet behind the pink bookshelves, which face her zebra chairs and gold chandelier. 

The couple's realtor previously pointed out her clients, who share their daughter Hilton, 9, and son Cruise, 6, are leaving more than the 'home they custom built.'

'This has been a treasured home for them for over 10 years, but like all of us, they're ready for a change,' Macatee told Page Six in May, while confirming they still plan on staying in the area

'Not just the amazing floor plan and very special features, but the home they brought babies into, the home they built businesses in, the home they built friendships in, the home they lived life in,' she noted to People.

She added: 'This is the start of a new and exciting chapter for the Westcott family. It's particularly fun for me because I grew up with Court and it's so fun to watch his marriage blossom and bloom.'

Macatee also gushed she loves seeing Court get a 'twinkle in his eye when he watches Kam be Kam.'  

The couple's realtor remarked: 'This is the start of a new and exciting chapter for the Westcott family. It's particularly fun for me because I grew up with Court and it's so fun to watch his marriage blossom and bloom'
