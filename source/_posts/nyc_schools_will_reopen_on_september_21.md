New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced schools will reopen for students to return in person on September 21

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced schools will reopen for students to return in person on September 21. 

In what he is calling a 'blended learning' system, students will only come in to school for two or three days per week and rotate in groups to ensure too many are not coming in at once. 

It's unclear how the children will be split. 

While children are not to go in to school in person until September 21, they are to begin remote learning for a three day 'transitional' period will begin on September 16. 

Kids will study remotely on September 16th, 17th and 18th. Then, they will start attending in person classes from September 21.
