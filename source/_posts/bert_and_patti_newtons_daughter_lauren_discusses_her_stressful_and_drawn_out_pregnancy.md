Lauren Newton has discussed the 'long and stressful' complications surrounding the birth of her newborn son, Alby, who was seven weeks premature.

The 40-year-old revealed that early health problems surrounding her pregnancy meant doctors admitted her to the hospital at 22 weeks, where she stayed until her and husband Matt Welsh's sixth child was born.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Lauren explained: 'Getting Alby here was not always a guarantee. I still look at him and want to pinch myself that he is actually here and he is healthy and safe.'

Three weeks ago, the daughter of TV icons Bert and Patti Newton revealed she was leaving the hospital after spending eighty days in hospital.  

Lauren admitted that while her time away from her other children was tough, it was 'what had to be done to keep her safe and to give the baby the best chance of survival.'

She said doctors told her it would be a case of 'when' she would have the baby rather than making her pregnancy to full-term .

Noting that little Alby could be born at any minute, Lauren said she saw each passing week as a 'celebration'.

The doctors advised her they would deliver at 34 weeks, but she suddenly went into labour the week earlier.

'To have such a long drawn out difficult time and then to have him born and be a boy and be healthy and beautiful and to name him Alby after dad, I just think there could not be a more perfect way for Matt and I to complete our family,' she added.

It has been three weeks since Lauren revealed she was going home and leaving Alby in the capable hands of doctors at the hospital.

'So wonderful to be home after 80 nights in hospital,' Lauren wrote in an Instagram snap shared at the time.

'Hard to leave Alby but he is in wonderful hands. Thanks to the special care nursery and his amazing paediatrician. We love you Alby,' she finished.

'It has been a long journey and we are so thrilled to have gorgeous Alby here safely. He is seven weeks early but doing really well,' she added in another Instagram picture.

Alby's early arrival came after Lauren revealed she had been separated from her young children for weeks due to complications with her pregnancy.

In July, she shared a photo to Instagram of her five young children, Sam, 11, Eva, nine, Lola, six, Monty, two, and Perla, 19 months, alongside a heartfelt message.

'Missing my gorgeous babies. It's been five weeks so far of not seeing them while I'm in hospital due to pregnancy complications,' she wrote.

Lauren added that she was relieved to know her five children were in good hands.

'I miss them so much but Matt and mum and dad [Bert and Patti] have done an incredible job,' she said.

Lauren had announced she was pregnant with her sixth child in May by sharing a sweet picture to social media of her youngest daughter holding a sonogram photo.

'Perla is thrilled she is going to be a big sister!' she wrote, along with the hashtag #babynumbersix.
