Cameron Diaz looked effortlessly stylish while running errands around LA on Monday.

The retired actress, 48, went for a classic-cool vibe, donning a simple white tee shirt and lightwash, boot-cut mom jeans during her outing.

Cameron was taking care of business after appearing on the premiere episode of Charlie's Angels co-star and close friend Drew Barrymore's daytime talk show.

Cameron flew under the radar in her All-American look, which she dressed up with a little straw bucket bag, simple white sneakers and a pair of tortoiseshell sunglasses. 

She also had a pair of square reading glasses perched on her head. Keeping safe amid the ongoing pandemic, Diaz had her requisite face gear on, clad in a dark, cloth mask.

The wife of Good Charlotte's Benji Madden kept her eye on her phone as she went from one task to another, making sure she didn't miss any messages about her nearly 10-month-old daughter Raddix.

Cameron was on the go after a pre-taped appearance on buddy Drew Barrymore's new show on Monday.

And while she and fellow castmate Lucy Liu seemed to have a blast during the show, Barrymore revealed how her friends almost missed their invitations onto the show.

There was a bit of TV magic going on during the shoot, making things look like all three were in studio together while actually split between an LA and NY shoot to socially distance per COVID-19 standards. 

Diaz was in LA while the other two were in NYC with a safe six-feet apart. 

And the pandemic wasn't the only hurdle the angelic reunion had to overcome.

Drew's sweet invitation to her friends didn't actually make it to the stars, and instead found its way to someone Barrymore described as a 'young boy.'

Whoops! The girls were delighted to be together, but Drew had to reveal how her original invitation text to Cameron Diaz accidentally got sent to 'a young boy' 

Lots of love: The 50 First Dates actress was full of love when she introduced her pals saying: 'I couldn’t begin this journey without two women who have been a part of my heart for over 20 years

Heaven sent: 'We are friends, we are fellow angels,' she went on about her 2000s era co-stars, seen in 2003's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle above

Return to sender? Before the reunion Drew tried to reach out to her friends, but her sweet text invitation strangely found its way to someone Barrymore described as a 'young boy'

'First I sent Cameron a video and I'm saying "Hey listen... I want to ask you something. Will you come on my show?' 

'...Because I'm so comfortable - I mean we have lived together all over the world -  so of course, to save time I sent her a video while I'm getting dressed.' 

Cameron and Lucy couldn't help but giggle as Drew continued.

'You don't see anything! I'm not that dumb,' she laughed, 'But I'm getting out of the shower and I'm ringing out of my towel.'

Strangely, Drew got zero response, prompting some concern.

'I don't hear back from her for like two days and I'm like "This is weird..."'

Strange... Drew said she was confused after Cameron kept her on read for 'two days,' so she called to check in

Can't help but giggle: Diaz burst into full laughter, as Drew revealed how the message went to someone completely random

After getting a bit 'freaked out' by the situation, Drew decided to call Cameron and see what's up.  

'So I call her and I'm like "What is going on? I'm worried. Is everything okay?"

But Cameron had no clue what Drew was even talking about.

'I'm like, "the video? You didn't get my video?" 

At that point, Diaz burst into full laughter, as Drew revealed how the message went to someone completely random.

'Turns out, a young boy watched the video,' Barrymore said with wide eyes.

'Lucky him!' Lucy chimed in.

Special delivery? 'Turns out, a young boy watched the video,' Barrymore said, prompting Lucy to chime in and say 'Lucky him!'
