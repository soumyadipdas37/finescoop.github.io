Jesy Nelson proudly boasted of her boyfriend Sean Sagar's culinary skills on Monday, as she took to Instagram to share a video of the actor in the kitchen. 

The Little Mix singer, 29, whose new relationship was unveiled last month after weeks of staunch denials, shared a video of the Our Girl star, 30, making her a healthy feast, just days after she discussed gaining weight in lockdown.

Her food post comes weeks after Jesy gave a startling insight into her daily diet as she shared a picture of her dinner - which comprised of a chicken breast and eight baby carrots - alongside three sad face emojis.

Jesy has been candid in the past about how she would starve herself before concerts and shoots. She told The Guardian: 'I'd drink Diet Coke for a solid four days and then, when I felt a bit dizzy, I'd eat a pack of ham because I knew it had no calories...

'Then I'd binge eat, then hate myself.' 

Reflecting on how she saw her eating at the time, she said: 'I could see that I was losing weight and sometimes I’d see a few good comments and that spiralled me to be like: ‘This is how I need to stay'. 

In March, the star told MailOnline she had been thrown off her usual healthy regime by lockdown and had become the 'laziest b***h ever'.
