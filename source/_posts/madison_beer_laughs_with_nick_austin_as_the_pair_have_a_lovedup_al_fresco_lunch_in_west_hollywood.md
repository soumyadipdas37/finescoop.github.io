They've been sparking dating rumors of late and looked to be enjoying each other's company during a leisurely weekday lunch meet.

Purported lovebirds Madison Beer and Nick Austin were seen at the West Hollywood, California eatery Toast on Tuesday, laughing it up with the waitress as they ordered their lunch.

The Baby songstress, 21, and rising TikTok star, 20, appeared to be engaged in a little game of footsie as they sat outside for their meal, before they were seen making their way back to her black Range Rover SUV.

Madison was camera-ready as usual for the sighting, in a tight yellow-green t-shirt that sported the slogan 'Guaranteed safe when taken as directed'.  

The Selfish singer busted out of the cropped tee, which ended just above her navel, allowing her lean midriff to show.

Beer matched the top with a pair of light wash jeans, and white Nike sneakers.

She had her long brown hair in loose pigtail braids, and allowed some tendrils to escape and frame her face nicely.

By way of accessories, the musician wore gold hoop earrings, a matching wristwatch, and some silver bangles on the opposite wrist.

Madison also had on an assortment of rings.

Austin's blond hair shined in the sunshine, and he matched Beer's footwear with white Nike trainers of his own.

The TikTok-er accessorized with a silver teddybear pendant necklace, and protected himself with a standard blue surgical face mask. 

Over the weekend, the alleged couple added further fuel to the fire when it comes to their rumored romance, when Nick treated his 8.9M TikTok followers to a snippet of Madison's new track Baby.

Toward the end of the clip, a hand comes into frame to 'shush' Austin and his pal... and it's unmistakably the manicured and bejeweled hand of Beer.
