The longest running entertainment news magazine in history is back for a record breaking 40th season.

ET host Kevin Frazier, 56, exclusively sat down with DailyMailTV's Thomas Roberts to talk about finally returning to the studio after months of filming from home amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In order to safely work from the CBS lot in Los Angeles, Frazier explained that the show has implemented a hoard of new COVID-19 safety protocols.

'The first thing we did was we got me out of my house because my children were not going to tolerate another week of me shooting there,' Frazier joked.

Like many shows, back in the spring ET transitioned to a film-from-home model and Frazier took on the challenge of hosting from his residence.

Now, the team is back on their iconic set but the television vet says things are very different because the usually bustling space is 'practically empty.'

'We walk straight in, we walk straight to the stage, everybody puts down their PPE and we walk off once we're done reading,' he explained.

The show has set up sanitizing stations on set and all of the crew members are outfitted with both face masks and face shields.

Kevin said that walking on stage for the first time in months was a surreal experience. 'It was very weird,' he reflected. 

'There's no interaction, there's no hanging out - there's nothing like that. And, we are really confined to our offices,' the Emmy winner explained.

During the pandemic, Kevin has been shooting inside his home while his wife, a busy lawyer, and children had to adjust their lives around the cameras.

'We walk straight in, we walk straight to the stage, everybody puts down their PPE and we walk off once we're done reading,' he explained.

The host, who is also the founder of the website HipHopHollywood, recently shared a video of bloopers showing viewers what filming in his house is really like.

Kevin's family constantly walks in and out of his frame while he films - hysterically unperturbed that a television show is happening in their living room and kitchen. 

'I shot all over the house,' he explained. His wife Yazmin was a frequent guest in the background bloopers and Kevin said was she none to pleased to find out that he shared images of their family outtakes on social media.

'You're going to get a cease and desist from that lawyer,' Thomas cracked.

In April, Kevin told DailyMailTV that inviting the cameras into his personal space was a bit of a bizarre experience.

'It's a little crazy. I'm in my office now and this was really a place where I could just shut off and nobody ever saw,' he said at the time. 

'No one ever came in here. It's interesting now that it's been on TV so much. Literally nobody was ever in here.'

Incredible: ET has been delivering the biggest entertainment news stories for four decades and has filmed over 10,000 shows

Lucky for the show, Kevin is a self-described tech junkie embraced that side of things, tapping into his dormant skills as a former news cameraman. 

For four decades, ET has been delivering the biggest entertainment news stories and has filmed over 10,000 shows.

In January, the show was awarded by the Guinness Book of World Records for The Longest Running Entertainment News Magazine in the world. 

Season 40 of ET with Kevin Frazier, Nischelle Turner, Lauren Zima, Matt Cohen and Rachel Smith premieres Monday, September 14.
