'It's a big change. It's part of the story. They were like, "do you want a wig or do you just want to go for it?" I like it.

'Christmas is going to be big for us on screen,' she explained, adding something major happens, but it's kind of this love triangle, who she's going to be with.'

The pair also discussed what it's been like to resume filming following lockdown, explaining that they’re in a filming bubble together.
