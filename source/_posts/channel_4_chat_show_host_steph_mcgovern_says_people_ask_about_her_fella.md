Steph McGovern has revealed how strangers often assume she is dating a man because she has had a baby. 

Speaking with comedian Suzi Ruffell on her Podcast Out, McGovern, 38, who lives with a female partner in Yorkshire, explained that some people think her partner is a man because she's had a baby and keeps details about her partner to herself. 

The broadcaster gave birth to her daughter in November last year and has kept her name a secret. 

The broadcaster, who hosts the lunchtime show Steph's Packed Lunch on Channel 4, from Leeds, said she had never officially come out and was sometimes accosted by people asking her about her 'fella.'

'I had someone coming to me the other day asking "so what does your fella thinks about blablabla..," she told Suzi. 

She said she never had a big coming out moment because she did not like labels.

'I've never officially come out,' she said, adding she had dated both men and women. 

'I didn't do this big thing of "I am gay", like my mate Reg did,' she said. 

She added that while she thought it was a 'big cliche,' she simply 'loved people' and did not feel like putting a name on it.  

'I just kinda go with the flow of things, and I did not really overthought it,' she added.  

She explained that it stemmed from the fact she was trying to live as normal a life as possible outside of her work in TV.

'It's not like I'm ashamed of anything in my life,' she said. 'It's more a case of I'm trying to lead as normal a life as I can.' 

She added her sexuality had never been a problem and that most of the people she worked with knew her partner was a woman. 

Interestingly, the broadcaster said she had been more discriminated for her northern accent than for being gay. 

She said she felt she could never get on TV because of of the Broadcasting House's preference for Received Pronunciation. 

McGovern, who welcomed her first baby with her partner in November last year, has kept the name of the child private. 

Nothing is known of her partner either, apart from the fact she is a woman and is believed to be a TV executive. 

'I just want to do my job and I know that my job comes under a certain scrutiny, and profile,' she said. 

'I just think that the less I talk about my private life, the less I can be asked about it,' she added.
