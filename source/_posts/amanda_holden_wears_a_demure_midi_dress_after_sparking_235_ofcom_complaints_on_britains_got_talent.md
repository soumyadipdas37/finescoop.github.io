Amanda Holden wore a demure midi dress as she left her Heart FM radio show in London on Tuesday after sparking 235 Ofcom complaints over her outfit on Saturday's Britain's Got Talent.

The judge, 49, opted for a long-sleeved bottle green knitted knee-length dress as she made an exit from the Global Studios in Leicester Square.

Amanda accessorised her look with a pair of matching coloured heel boots, a crocodile print handbag and oversized black sunglasses.

The presenter put on a defiant display as she beamed to photographers outside the studio while on her way home. 

It comes after Amanda sparked Ofcom complaints for her plunging navy gown with a daring thigh-high slit on Saturday's fourth semi-final of Britain Got Talent where fans claimed to 'see her nipples'.

The regulator is said to have received 277 complaints with 235 of them about the star's dress, reports the Mirror.

Amanda's racy item of clothing featured a plunging neckline and was boned to accentuate her cleavage.

Details: Amanda accessorised her look with a pair of matching coloured heel boots, a crocodile print handbag and oversized black sunglasses 

It also cinched in to showcase her svelte waist and featured a perilously high thigh slit up the leg of the gown.

During the show, some fans claimed Amanda had suffered a nip slip in the look and they took to Twitter to question if they'd seen more than they'd bargained for during the show. 

One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'

Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'

Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?' 

MailOnline has contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment. 

This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show. 

Amanda's wardrobe has led to some controversial moments in the past after a daring Julien Macdonald gown she wore during the semi-final of BGT three years ago attracted a staggering 663 Ofcom complaints.

Ofcom said that while it recognised the dress 'had potential to offend some viewers during what is a family show' - the outfit 'would not have exceeded most viewers' expectations'.

While in 2016, Ofcom again decided not to investigate the ITV show after outfits worn by Amanda and fellow judge Alesha Dixon sparked 90 complaints from viewers.

Meanwhile Diversity's Black Lives Matter inspired performance during the show's first semi-final attracted 24,500 complaints to Ofcom, who have since announced they will not investigate any further.

ITV has 'stood with Diversity' as they featured adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial dance.

It comes after Amanda revealed that a song on her new album is dedicated to an eight-year-old girl who tragically died from cancer last year.

The Britain's Got Talent judge, 49, is gearing up for the release of her new album Songs From My Heart next month, which is a collection of her favourite musical and film sound tracks.

Talking about one of the songs, When She Loved Me, which is used on Toy Story 2, Amanda emotionally revealed that it is dedicated to Izzie who tragically passed away last year aged eight to cancer.

Posting a picture of herself and Izzie to Instagram on Tuesday, Amanda penned: 'And this is Izzie... who 'When She Loved Me' is dedicated to. 

'She passed last year after a huge fight against cancer aged just 8 years old - copy and paste this link to donate to a run that her Daddy is doing in her name https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/runforizzietyler.'

Amanda also shared a brief video of herself singing the emotional song, written by Randy Newman for Toy Story 2 in 1999.

Also featuring on the album is the song With You from the musical Ghost, based on the hit 1990 film.

Amanda revealed that the emotional song reminds her and husband Chris Hughes of their late son Theo, who was tragically stillborn in 2011.

The presenter revealed in an emotional Instagram post earlier this month that she feels 'every word, every emotion and every breath it takes' to sing it.

Sharing a video of herself talking about the song and album on her Heart FM radio show, Amanda penned: 'I'm so happy and honoured that my @thisisheart family are the first to play my debut single 'With You' ❤️ from my album 'Songs From My Heart' 

'This song means the absolute world to me through the connection that Chris and I have with the meaning of the song, it evokes strong and personal feelings for the both of us. 

''You took my world away, you took my life away', will always remind us how we felt when we lost Theo. So when I sing this song I feel every word, every emotion, every breath it takes me to sing it. 

'I really hope you connect with my version of the song as it was a joy to be able to record it and let you all in a little bit ✨ You can download on the link in my bio now.'

Other songs on the album include I Dreamed a Dream from Les Misérables and Don't Cry for Me Argentina.

Talking about Songs From My Heart in a statement earlier this month, Amanda said: 'People think they know who I am because they see me being loud and outrageous on the television or radio. 

'That is a part of me but really I'm all about my family. This album is all the songs I've loved in my life, sung for the people who mean the most to me. It's a very emotional album that everyone can relate to.'

She added: ' I had a tape recorder as a little girl and would sing into it dreaming of this moment.

'There is a story behind every song on the album, celebrating life, love and loss – the darkest and happiest moments in my life so far. It is literally my heart laid bare.'

Songs From My Heart is set to be released on October 2.
