A paedophile father jailed for taking explicit pictures of young girls including his own daughter and niece claims he only did it to 'increase his sexual performance with his wife'.

The 42-year-old man, who can't be named, faced the Alice Springs Supreme Court in the Northern Territory on Thursday and pleaded guilty to 28 charges related to gross indecency. 

The court heard the man had a collection of more than 2,000 child abuse images of girls aged between one and 16, the NT News reported. 

Among the 'disgraceful and perverted' images were several explicit pictures of his daughter and niece while they were sleeping or otherwise unaware.

The pictures were taken on numerous occasions when the girls were as young as one and as old as seven.

The father said he didn't use the photos for his own sexual gratification but to 'increase his sexual performance with his child's mother'.

Other than his daughter and niece four of the other victims were known to the man, three were under the age of 10 and another was under 16.

The horrific collection also included pictures of random girls at Darwin shopping centres with their families.  

The father said his offending started with images of children in swimsuits before he moved on to explicit material, which included bestiality and sadism. 

He also attributed some of his behaviour to a methamphetamine habit.

Justice Graham Hiley said the man had shown genuine remorse for his actions and that his offending was on the low end of the scale. 

'Your offending is not as serious as we normally see … because your victims did not know what you were doing and did not suffer any emotional harm,' he said.

The 42-year-old father was sentenced to six years in jail with a minimum of four years served before he is eligible for parole.
