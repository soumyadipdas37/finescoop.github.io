The Crown met The Throne as stars of two of the biggest international TV hits enjoyed a night out together in London. 

Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip in The Crown, spent the evening with Emilia Clarke, Princess Daenerys Targaryen in Game Of Thrones, sparking speculation of romance. 

The pair – who appeared together in the 2015 movie Terminator: Genisys – were all smiles as they sauntered through Soho together on Friday night after enjoying dinner at the Russian-inspired Bob Bob Ricard restaurant.

Miss Clarke, 33, wore white flared trousers and brown suede boots, while 37-year-old Smith dressed down in white T-shirt, grey jacket and black trousers. 

He split from actress Lily James nine months ago, having previously dated model Daisy Lowe, the daughter of rock star Gavin Rossdale. 

He was also romantically linked to Karen Gillan, his co-star when he was Doctor Who between 2010 and 2013. 

He met Miss James a year later on the set of the film Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, but they split amid rumours of his close friendship with Claire Foy, who starred opposite him as the Queen in The Crown.

By comparison, Miss Clarke – who was named Esquire magazine’s Sexiest Woman Alive in 2015 – has had an uncomplicated love life. 

She recently split from director and writer Charlie McDowell, the son of actor Malcolm McDowell and US actress Mary Steenburgen. 

She previously dated Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the US animated comedy Family Guy.
