Jessica Hart has announced she is expecting her first child with NASCAR driver boyfriend James Kirkham.

The 34-year old former Victoria's Secret model shared the thrilling news to her Instagram page early Friday morning.

'James and I are officially pregnant,' she wrote, alongside an image of her holding up the results of an at-home pregnancy test.   

'We’re super duper excited!' On Friday, Jessica Hart announced she was pregnant with NASCAR driver boyfriend James Kirkham and said it's a 'blessing'

She continued: 'We’re so super duper excited about this awesome news, especially at this time and amongst the mainly bleak news out there. What a blessing. We’re so unbelievably grateful and happy!

The blonde bombshell who lives in Los Angeles took advantage of the announcement to share her concerns about other mothers less fortunate.  

'It makes me think deeply about all the other mothers to-be out there at the moment that are struggling with access to doctors and healthcare at this time,' she wrote.

She then went on to show her support for the organisation Every Mother Counts, which was founded by supermodel Christy Turlington Burns in 2010, following the release of her documentary film, No Woman, No Cry.

'I’d really love if everyone can JOIN ME in donating... Anything you can give really helps. This beautiful organisation helps pregnant woman in need. I couldn’t imagine going through this without some support,' she wrote. 

Jessica and James were first spotted together on Valentine's Day 2019, when they headed out for dinner in Los Angeles. 

They made their romance official shortly afterwards.

Glorious! 'We’re so super duper excited about this awesome news, especially at this time and amongst the mainly bleak news out there. What a blessing. We’re so unbelievably grateful and happy!' Jessica wrote on Instagram

In August 2019, Jessica revealed she was relocating to LA from New York to live with her 'supportive boyfriend'.

Her last serious relationship before James was with billionaire Stavros Niarchos III. 

James has a young daughter named Wren from a previous relationship.       

While Jess was born in Sydney, she relocated to the US soon after breaking into the industry, and later walked for Victoria's Secret in 2013.

Throughout her career, Jessica has also modelled for the likes of Marc Jacobs, Portmans, Seafolly and Michael Kors.
