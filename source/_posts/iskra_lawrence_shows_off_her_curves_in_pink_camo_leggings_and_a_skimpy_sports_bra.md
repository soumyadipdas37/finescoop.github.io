She became a first-time mother back in April, when she and her partner Philip Payne welcomed the birth of their baby son. 

And since then Iskra Lawrence has been giving updates on life as a mum and her postpartum fitness.

On Sunday the model made the most of the Los Angeles sunshine with an intense hike, wowing in pretty workout clothes.

The blonde looked incredible in her tight camo leggings, matching the pink pair to her low-cut sports bra.

She added a touch of glam with large hoop earrings and kept safe with a face mask as she navigated the steep canyon with a smile on her face.  

The model recently admitted that her exercise regime hasn't been 'consistent' since giving birth four months ago, but said she was 'in awe' that her body has given her the gift of motherhood.

In one of her regular video updates, Iskra shared her three-step workout with her followers.

Dubbing the video to the upbeat Demi Lovato track Sorry Not Sorry, the star said the simple exercises worked for her as she'd found it 'hard' to exercise since giving birth.

Writing a candid caption she added: 'I have NOT been consistent with working out, finding the time - and energy is hard. 

'But when I do, I'm reminded how nourishing moving my body is. And I'm still in awe that it's only been a few months since I pushed an actual baby out.

'Be gentle to yourself and kind to your body. You're doing amazing!!! Also, these moves aren't just for PP they are great for everyBODY.'

It comes after Iskra detailed the 'pressures' of breastfeeding her four-month-old baby son in another candid video. 

Iskra admitted there have been times when she's had a 'screaming, hungry baby' while being a 'sobbing mess' as she opened up on her anxieties about the process via Instagram.

The body confidence advocate displayed the various different positions she uses to feed her son alongside a lengthy caption.

'Let's just get to the point. Breastfeeding is hard af!' she wrote. 'And it's not ok that so much pressure is put on women to be able to do it. Or that you won't have the same connection if you can't breastfeed - that is BS.

'It's not 'breast is best' it's 'fed is best'. As I shared before my milk supply dropped completely and it was awful. A screaming hungry baby and I was a sobbing mess.

'I wish I wouldn't have put so much pressure on myself surrounding breast feeding. I wish I had a formula ready that my baby liked, and not been afraid of using it.

'When I tried supplementing with formula it really was the biggest relief and will happily do it whenever we need to. 

'So this video is me sharing the positions that have worked for us - best latching and most comfortable.'
