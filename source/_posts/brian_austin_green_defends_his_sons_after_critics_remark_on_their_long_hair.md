He is the doting father of sons Kassius, 18, Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four.

And Brian Austin Green defended his three youngest sons after the critics remarked on the long length of their hair on Instagram on Friday. 

Fans began commenting on their hairstyles in a selfie Brian took with the boys, prompting him to reply, 'In my opinion they are beautiful.'

All three of his youngest sons, who he shares with estranged wife Megan Fox, have hair that roughly reaches their shoulders or beyond. 

Some fans seemed to dislike the hair on the kids, with one writing: 'There's something not right when they all look/dress like girls.' 

In a lengthy response, Brian wrote: 'The fact is my boys have and like long hair. In my opinion they are beautiful and will still be and possibly be mistaken for girls if they wore matching shorts and tshirts combos and had short hair.' 

'Some people like boys and men with long hair,' the Beverly Hills 90210 actor added. 'Some people don't. Both opinions are ok.'  

They're beautiful: A day after sharing a selfie with the young boys, fans commented on the length of their hair to which he replied 'In my opinion they are beautiful' 

'I've read some of the comments here,' he started his response. 'I'm not saying anything is right or wrong.' 

Adding: 'I think some people with different opinions are attacked because opinions usually start with the words 'I think' or something similar. When people state opinions as facts is when arguments happen.'

Green also responded to a comment asking why he shaved his son Kassius' head 'without his mother's approval?' 

But that actor insisted 'that's how he wanted it.' 

Opinions not facts: Adding: 'I think some people with different opinions are attacked because opinions usually start with the words 'I think' or something similar. When people state opinions as facts is when arguments happen' 

Co-parenting: Green shares Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four, with estranged wife Megan Fox and his son Kassius, 18 from a previous relationship 

His ex Megan, 34, previously spoke on raising her children gender neutral. 

In 2019 she talked about raising her kids without gender rules. 'Much of my ego has been constructed around this idea that I'm not like most girls,' she said. 

Adding: 'I'm somehow more masculine, tougher, less permeable or feminine.' 

'When I became pregnant with Noah, I could feel, through my mother's intuition I suppose, that he was not subscribing to gender stereotypes, so I decided to provide an environment for him early on that would allow him to discover how he wanted to express himself,' she said.

Moving on: The couple married in 2010 and announced their split earlier this year, with Fox moving on with her co-star rapper Machine Gun Kelly  

She also offered some advice to other moms. 'If a boy loves princesses and a girl loves baseball, that's not indicative of their sexuality,' Fox allowed. 

'It's indicative of their communication and creative expression. We can't limit children by telling them how they should play.' 

And Fox also said to not force gender toys on them. 'Don't insist on buying him a football for Christmas,' she said.  

'It's not our job to shape them into the people we think they should be,' added Fox. 'It's our job to receive, with grace, the lessons they bring us. Children are mirrors that reflect back to us our shadow selves, our shame and our insecurities.

Staying positive: In an Instagram Live video last month, Green appeared somewhat upbeat about his marital woes and didn't rule out the possibility of a reconciliation with Fox 

'It's our job to love and nurture the child as they are so they can thrive as adults.' 

The couple married in 2010 and announced their split earlier this year, with Fox moving on with her co-star rapper Machine Gun Kelly.  

In an Instagram Live video last month, Green appeared somewhat upbeat about his marital woes.  

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he said. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'   

Green continued: 'I'm on my path doing what I feel I need to do to be happy and it's not for a lack of love for the kids or lack of being responsible, it's really important to take care of yourself. t's important for us as parents to take care of ourselves. I wish her all the best and I wish myself the best as well.'
