Police assault claims against Canberra Raiders centre Curtis Scott have been dropped after police bod camera footage showed the star asleep during his arrest.

The 22-year-old was charged with seven offences, including two of assaulting a police officer and one of resisting arrest, following Australia Day celebrations in Sydney.

Officers had claimed the alleged assault took place as they tried to arrest the star, but video footage shown to court shows him 'dreamily' trying to brush off the police and stay asleep.Â 

Police alleged they were alerted when Scott was seen acting erratically on Regent Street at Paddington before finding him asleep near Driver Avenue at Moore Park in the early hours of January 27.

He was accused of assaulting a female constable and male senior constable before being tasered, arrested and taken to Surry Hills Police Station.

In the hours leading up to the incident, Scott posted to social media videos of himself partying with Raiders teammates at The Ivy nightclub in the Sydney CBD.

But in the Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday, prosecutors showed 72 seconds of police bodycam footage showing Scott slumped against a tree when attempts to rouse him failed.

Magistrate Jennifer Giles commented: 'It's drawing a very long frightening bow to argue police can handcuff someone they are trying to wake up while sleeping under a tree.'

Scott has pleaded guilty to two counts of behaving in an offensive manner near a public place

The prosecutor then withdrew the two counts of assaulting a police officer, one of resisting an officer in execution of duty, one of behaving in an offensive manner and one of remaining on Trust lands after being requested to leave.

Scott has pleaded guilty to two counts of behaving in an offensive manner near a public place.

He will return to court on Thursday for sentence and argument over legal costs.
