A doctor has been blasted by viewers after she burst out laughing while speaking about people dying from coronavirus on This Morning.

Dr Nighat Arif, a GP from Buckinghamshire, appeared on the show today to speak to hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield about the importance of having a flu jab during the coronavirus pandemic. 

However, while explaining that the consequences of contracting both Covid-19 and flue could be 'dire', the GP began giggling, before saying that she thought it was 'really cool' to have her temperature checked before she came into the building. 

One user called her behaviour 'inappropriate', while a nurse took to Twitter to insist she was 'surprised' a doctor would think that temperature checks are amusing, and that 'it's funny when she talks about dying'. 

Dr Nighat Arif from, from Buckinghamshire, was blasted by viewers after she burst out laughing while speaking about people dying from coronavirus on This Morning

The doctor appeared on the show today to speak to hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield about the importance of having a flu jab during the coronavirus pandemic

The doctor was asked by host Holly, 39, whether stocks for the jab were running low, to which she replied: 'So every year we have a huge demand.'

'We have an ageing population, but we are seeing more people want it because people are desperately trying not to get coronavirus. 

'If you get coronavirus and flu, the consequences can be dire. Mainly because both of these viruses can affect your lungs.  

'You can get bronchitis and pneumonia so anything that comprises your airway, breathing and circulation. 







One user called her behaviour 'inappropriate', while a nurse took to Twitter to insist she was 'surprised' a doctor would think that temperature checks are amusing, and that 'it's funny when she talks about dying'

Laughing halfway through her sentence, the doctor went on: 'Well, that's not good and essentially you can die. We want to make sure we limit those factors as much as possible.' 

Host Phil maintained a straight face as he probed further: 'I know certainly from our point of view, coming in here in the morning if I get something else and my temperature is up a bit, they won't let me in the building.' 

Giggling once again, the doctor replied: 'Yeah, I know. I had that temperature check when I came into the building. It was really cool actually.' 

Viewers were not impressed with the doctor's manner, and quickly took to Twitter to vent their rage. 

While explaining that the consequences of contracting both Covid-19 and flue could be 'dire', the GP began laughing mid sentence 

The GP also said that she thought it was 'really cool' to have her temperature checked before she came into the building

One said: 'Did that doctor just laugh about having the temperature checked? it means no work, no school, worrying about something more. Is she living in the same country as us? or is she from another planet?' 

'This "doctor" thinks that death is funny as f***!', raged another 

A third wrote: 'As a nurse I'm very surprised that the doctor you have just had on thinks it's funny when she talks about dying and thinks getting her temperature checked is cool. She is not appropriate to be discussing such serious topics.' 

'Doctor laughing while speaking about death,' tweeted a fourth.
