Jamie Vardy made it six goals in five matches for Leicester at West Brom as last season’s Golden Boot winner struck two second-half penalties to make the perfect start to the new season.

After Timothy Castagne had given the Foxes a 56th-minute lead on his debut following his £22million move from Atalanta, Vardy made the result safe from the spot following Kyle Bartley’s foul on him. He then repeated the trick in the 84th minute as West Brom found themselves outclassed in the latter part of the game.

Earlier, Vardy had given Leicester an injury scare when he fell to the ground clutching the back of his right thigh after a poor challenge on Albion goalkeeper Sam Johnstone.

Yet he was fit enough to get off the mark for the new campaign and restore a little calm at Leicester, whose poor form in the second half of last season cost them a Champions League spot, while Ben Chilwell joined Chelsea for £50m between the seasons. 

Despite a bright start, Albion were second best from the half-hour mark, while the visitors were also boosted by James Maddison’s appearance as a 75th-minute substitute, following hip surgery in July.

Never could Albion have imagined that their return to the top flight after a two-year absence would be played before empty stands as the coronavirus pandemic continues to shape football worldwide. 

Manager Slaven Bilic has made it clear that he would like more players after adding three of last season’s loan stars – Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira and Callum Robinson – on permanent deals.

Brendan Rodgers shares Bilic’s wishes and called for more ‘quality’ in his squad before this one. With Jonny Evans suspended and Wes Morgan and Filip Benkovic injured, Rodgers moved holding midfielder Wilfred Ndidi into central defence and gave a debut to £22million signing from Atalanta Timothy Castagne.

Bilic opted for a 3-4-3 formation with no orthodox centre-forward. Albion used Robinson at the point of their attack and allowed Diangana and Pereira to roam behind him.

In the early stages, Leicester were twice nearly caught on the break. Diangana had made a lively start and freed Robinson in the ninth minute for a cut-back that did not find a team-mate. 

Soon afterward, Justin switched off at left-back, allowing Johnstone to find Darnell Furlong with a single pass. Justin hacked Furlong down on the edge of the box but Pereira’s free-kick was deflected wide.

It was not until the half-hour mark that Leicester started to threaten. Harvey Barnes – who had a fine loan spell at The Hawthorns in the first half of the 2018-19 campaign – spun into space and released Ayoze Perez inside the box, only for the Spaniard to take a poor touch.

Then it was Barnes’ turn to waste a good chance when he volleyed straight at Johnstone from eight yards after Dennis Praet twice swapped passes with Perez before crossing. 

Moments later, Johnstone denied Barnes again from inside the box, and showed sharp reflexes once more to keep out Vardy’s angled effort, although the forward was offside. Leicester were starting to hold sway before the break and after it, they picked up where they had left off. 

Barnes was increasingly influential on the left, bursting from deep and creating space for team-mates.

When the goal came, it was Perez and Praet who combined once again. After Albion had made a mess of clearing a corner, the Spaniard found Praet and the midfielder clipped over a delightful ball for his fellow Belgian to power in a header at the far post.

The Foxes thought they had doubled their advantage soon afterwards when Barnes’ deflected volley looped over Johnstone and was turned in by Perez. Yet the goal was chalked off as Vardy was in an offside position when the ball skimmed off his shoulder.

Vardy was not to be denied in the 73rd minute when Bartley bundled him over as he charged into the box anticipating a cross from Barnes. Vardy sent the ball to Johnstone’s right and 10 minutes later, he did precisely the same, with the kick awarded this time for Dara O’Shea’s clumsy tackle on Justin.

It was an impressive recovery from a player whose afternoon looked to be finished when, after a late challenge on Johnstone, he limped away and fell to the ground with his hands over his face. But then again, Vardy has made a career out of confounding expectations.
