She rocked the chic belted yellow dress for a dinner outing with pal Addison Rae on Tuesday night. 

But before her evening out, Kourtney Kardashian did a mini photo shoot from the comfort of her luxurious living room in Calabasas, California.

The 41-year-old put her long, toned legs on display in the slideshow as she posed in front of a large book on a stand, asking her followers the philosophical question: 'Turn the page or close the book.'

Kourtney donned a Jacquemus dress in a sunrise yellow town; the thigh-grazing number featured drawstring accents on the skirt and along her midriff.

The mother of three paired the stylish number with strappy yellow sandals, adding bold lipstick and center parted, pulled back hair.

She posed in front of a large book that sat on a book stand in the corner of her living room, with a pot of green moss beneath it. 

The brunette beauty was seen rocking the gorgeous look with a mini Louis Vuitton handbag as she left Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood on Tuesday night with friend Addison Rae, a Tik Tok star and budding actress.

This is not the first glimpse at her stunning living room; she has previously shared images from the elegant yet comfortable room at her Calabasas mansion on her Instagram page, as well as taking viewers on a detailed tour in an Architectural Digest video for a cover story she did for the magazine in 2016.

In the video, Kourtney and her interior designer Martin Lawrence Bullard spoke about items in her living room, kitchen and foyer.

On her living room, Kourtney said: 'It's really for special occasions. We celebrated Christmas morning and New Year's Eve here. It's really chic but practical.'

The room has a large limestone fireplace with plenty of seating, a large pool table and a Yamaha piano.

Kourtney said of the piano: 'This is my childhood piano, and all the kids are learning to play on it now, just like I did.'

In the clip, her designer said that she has wool sofas with silver-fox throw pillows; her brown leather chairs feature Astrakhan pillows.

Kourtney showed off her museum quality Oscar Niemeyer chair, which was designed in 1971, as well as her vintage lamp- a Von Sculptural Ribbon Lamp from Abate, and vintage 1960's candy box.

She has an Alabaster ring chandelier with Edison light bulbs, an iron based, limestone top consul table, as well as a Damien Hirst diamond dust skull (which she revealed was a gift from ex Scott Disick for 'Christmas a couple of years ago').

The beauty also has a potted plant, constant fresh flowers in her large vases and plenty of books, including a gifted one from Kendall.

The coffee table has a lot of books as well; the curtains are made of wool in a neutral beige tone with a grid-style rug.

There's also a kissing vignette paper weight on my books on a side table, onyx and iron framed sconce, a Ruven Afanador photograph.

In the video, Kourtney pointed out her Assyrian inlaid game boxes that once belonged to her father, the late Robert Kardashian Sr., who passed away in 2003 at the age of 59 from Esophageal cancer.
