A rock musician has been ordered to pay a disabled ex-girlfriend £100 in compensation after he bundled her out of her wheelchair.

Bass player Grant Timperley, 37, initially tried to avoid mother-of-one Natalie Garside when she waved at him after a concert when she went to congratulate him on March 5. 

Timperley's rock band Velvet Scream was playing at the Retro Bar in Manchester City Centre. 

He then shouted: 'Will you just f*** off' at her when she tried to say 'hello' to him in a side room.

During the assault, Timperley manhandled and grabbed 34-year-old Mrs Garside with such force her wheelchair tipped over and she crashed into a wall. 

The victim, who had been at the concert with her husband Richard, 44, hit her head in the impact and was said to be left in agonising pain with double vision. 

Police were called to the concert venue in Manchester after Timperley was asked to leave by staff. 

Timperley, from Altrincham, Trafford, admitted assault at Manchester Magistrates' Court.

Mrs Garside, who had not seen Timperley for more than ten years, later told police: 'I was in agonising pain and felt like my brain had been thrown about and my vision was worse than double vision.'

She added: 'This incident has made me question everything and I'm even starting to not trust my own husband in some ways. 

'I can't get out of my head what Grand did. I felt like my life was a photo book and he's grabbed it and torn it to little pieces.'   

Mrs Garside, who began using a wheelchair following a road accident in 2002, said: 'It made me no longer want to go out alone and it made me feel vulnerable at the possibility of going out in Manchester again. 

Timperley, who also works for an IT company, later admitted attacking Mrs Garside but told police he 'didn't intend to harm her in the way that he did'

'It made me feel afraid as I don't know where he lives and don't know what would happen if I saw him again.'  

Timperley, who also works for an IT company, later admitted attacking Mrs Garside but told police he 'didn't intend to harm her in the way that he did'. 

He had previous convictions of assaulting a paramedic, being drunk and disorderly, battery and criminal damage.

In mitigation defence, lawyer Mr Nnamdi Inegbu said: 'He's fully remorseful and clearly could have dealt with things a bit more diplomatically but it was the shock and anticipation of her coming towards him. 

'He was not really expecting and unfortunately he acted in the manner that he did. He does not want any contact whatsoever with this lady.

'He wants to draw a line under the matter and simply get on with his life.'  

Timperley was ordered to abide by a 8pm to 6am curfew for eight weeks and was also ordered to pay £85 costs.
