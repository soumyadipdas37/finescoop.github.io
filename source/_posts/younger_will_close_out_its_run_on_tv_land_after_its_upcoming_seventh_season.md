Younger is literally not getting any older, with the show to close out its run after the upcoming seventh season.

Series creator Darren Star was promoting his upcoming Netflix comedy Emily in Paris, when he told TV Line that Younger is coming to an end.

'We are unofficially planning [Season 7] as a final season,' Star told the publication, while also offering an update on the production schedule.

Filming on Season 7 was set to begin in New York City when production was shut down due to COVID-19.

The sixth season ended in September 2019, with filming on the seventh season slated to begin, 'in a few weeks.'

Star also added he has plans to integrate the COVID-19 pandemic into this final season, but it won't happen right away.

'A lot of episodes were written (before the pandemic),' Star revealed, adding, 'the action of Younger sort of picks up where the last season left off, which was before the pandemic.'

'But I do think we’re looking forward to incorporating it into the action as the season progresses,' Star revealed.

Star also confirmed news from May that a Younger spin-off focusing on Hilary Duff's Kelsey Peters is currently in development.

The series centers on Sutton Foster's Liza Miller, a 40-something mother, who gets mistaken for someone much younger.

She decides to use this as a springboard to remake both her professional career and her love life as a 26 year old.

She lands a job in her dream in the field she's always dreamed of working, as she tries to work her way up while keeping her age a secret.
