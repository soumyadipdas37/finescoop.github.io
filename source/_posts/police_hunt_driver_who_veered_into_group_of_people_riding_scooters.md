Police are hunting for a driver who veered into a group of people riding scooters in Denver, killing one man and leaving another seriously injured. 

The incident took place at 1:36am at 14th Street and Arapahoe Street in the city's downtown area. 

The four scooter riders were turning left on Arapahoe Street when a silver Chevy Colbalt travelling in the same direction veered into the left lane, police say. 

Two of the riders were hit by the vehicle, throwing one man from the scooter and onto the sidewalk, causing him fatal injury.

The two-door Chevy Colbalt, likely a 2005 to 2010 model, sustained 'heavy front-end damage' during the incident, Lt. Robert Rock of the Denver Police Department's Traffic Investigations Unit said. 

He added that it would likely also have damaged the driver's side view mirror. 

The driver is wanted for vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a crash that resulted in a death.
