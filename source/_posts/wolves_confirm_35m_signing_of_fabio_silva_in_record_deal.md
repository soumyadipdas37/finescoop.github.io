Wolves have completed the signing of Portuguese wonderkid Fabio Silva for a club record fee.

The 18-year-old has arrived from Porto and signed on the dotted line, costing the Midlands club in the region of £35million.

Wolves officially unveiled the starlet on Saturday, via the club's official website and social media channels.

Silva had a £112million buy out clause  in his Porto contract, but the Portuguese giants have been forced to consider substantially lower offers following the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Wolves took delight in introducing the new boy to their supporters, using a promotional video which alluded to the repeated comparisons made between Silva and Portugal legend Cristiano Ronaldo.

Silva became the youngest player to represent Porto when he made his first team debut last year aged 17 years and 22 days.  

Wolves chairman Jeff Shi has revealed the 18-year-old has been watched for some time, and that Wolves feel they could not have identified a better player.

'Our recruitment team have been watching Fabio since he played for Portugal under-16s and they feel he has always been the best number nine coming through his age group anywhere in Europe,' Shi told the club's website.

'Fabio has the potential to be a generational talent and for us to see him develop under Nuno is very exciting. He is the type of player our fans will love
