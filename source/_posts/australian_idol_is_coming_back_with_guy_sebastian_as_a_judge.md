Channel 10 is rumoured to be planning a relaunch of Australian Idol.

After a swathe of classic shows were remade this year, including Farmer Wants a Wife and Big Brother, the network is said to be considering rebooting Idol with inaugural winner Guy Sebastian as its marquee judge.

'They're eager to get him involved - they know the show's success is dependent on a brilliant judging line-up,' an insider told Woman's Day. 

Blast from the past: Rumours are swirling that Channel 10 is looking to bring back Australian Idol with inaugural winner Guy Sebastian (pictured in 2003) as a judge 

'If all goes to plan, the show will be back with Guy,' the source added. 'Getting him back on the show that made him famous would be a dream.'

Seven reportedly had the opportunity to reboot the franchise in February, but did not make an announcement or release a casting call.

Guy is believed to be currently signed to Channel Nine.
