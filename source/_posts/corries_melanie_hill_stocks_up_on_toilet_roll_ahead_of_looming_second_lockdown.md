Melanie Hill was spotted stocking up on loo roll, ahead of the government's looming second national lockdown amid the COVID-19 crisis.

Likely aiming to avoid the scramble for toilet paper that was seen nationwide back in March, the Coronation Street actress, 58, was accompanied by her husband Jimmy Daly as she grabbed herself a huge pack in Manchester on Tuesday.

Her writer and producer husband also had his hands full, carrying a big pack of kitchen rolls as they made their way through MediaCityUK with their purchases.

Melanie, ex-wife of actor Sean Bean, went casual for the outing, donning a dark coat over a patterned top, which she teamed with black jogging bottoms.

Adding a flourish of colour with a pair of bright pink running shoes, the actress wore her fiery red hair in shoulder-length curls.

Donning a pair of tinted spectacles, she walked beside her husband of three years, who wore a black coat with jeans and green Adidas tennis shoes.

Their excursion came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a speech in the House of Commons announcing tightened coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday.

His announcement comes after Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the UK could hit 50,000 cases a day by mid-October and 200 plus daily deaths by November unless Britain changes course. 

Melanie, who plays Cathy Matthews, returned to work on the Corrie set back in June, after production was halted for three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cast and crew over the age of 70, or with an underlying health condition, were kept at home during the early stages of production returning. 

The new safety measures are in accordance with the recently issued TV production guidelines, which have been observed while filming the top ITV soap.

While the new restrictions include 10pm curfews for pubs and restaurants and people being urged to work from home where possible, it appears that filming schedules for shows will currently remain unaffected.
