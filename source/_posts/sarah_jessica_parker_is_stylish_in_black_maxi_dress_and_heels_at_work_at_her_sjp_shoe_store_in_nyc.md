She opened her flagship designer shoe store in Midtown Manhattan in July.

And on Tuesday, Sex And the City star Sarah Jessica Parker was once again seen working at the boutique on New York City's W. 54th Street.

The actress turned shoe designer, who's 55, was dressed all in black for her shift and wore a cloth face mask as she waited for customers.

SJP had on an ankle-length dress with long sleeves and a low-cut v-neckline.

She added a pair of shiny black heels, no doubt from her own SJP Collection.

Her long hair was loose and tumbled in relaxed curls down around her shoulders.

Parker, who launched her footwear brand in 2014, set up shop in what was previously the Manolo Blahnik store which featured in her hit HBO series and where she herself used to go shopping for shoes.

In an interview with Footwear News, published Tuesday, Parker explained she was 'both thrilled and daunted' by the location's history when she opened up.

'I have memories in this building, in this store,' she said. 'I have real, sincere memories of making those purchases, not making purchases, looking at stuff, and then its role in Sex and the City, and the way we got to be in this store.'

Parker starred as Carrie Bradshaw on Sex And The City from 1998 to 2004, and reprised the role in two big screen movies released in 2008 and 2010.

In 2016, she returned to HBO as the lead in the dramedy Divorce which ran for three seasons.

Home: Parker and her family have remained living in the Big Apple during the COVID-19 pandemic. 'We're just trying to keep contributing to the city,' the star told THR.com last week

And while many celebrities left New York City when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Parker and her family - husband Matthew Broderick, son James, 17, and 11-year-old twins Marion and Tabitha - have remained living in the Big Apple. 

'I go to work, I go to the stores. I walk the streets. We go to our local grocery stores. We try to order in from restaurants,' the star told THR.com last week. 'We're just trying to keep contributing to the city.'

She added: 'So many of us have had good fortune here, and we owe it to the city to embed ourselves in its revitalization. We have to find a way to support our businesses so that there is a reason to come home, and that's the only way I can imagine this Phoenix rising from the ashes, is to keep reinvesting. Not just financially, but also emotionally.'
