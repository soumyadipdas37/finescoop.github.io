Elton John and his husband David Furnish are reportedly producing their own line of non-alcoholic apple juice as they become the latest stars to create their own drink. 

The musician, 73, who celebrated 30 years sober in July, is following in the footsteps of Kylie Minogue, who has a range of wine, and David Beckham, who has whisky.

According to The Mirror, Elton and David's venture has already got a star-studded waiting list with Victoria Beckham and Elizabeth Hurley expressing interest.

The publication reports that the couple's 'first vintage' will be called Woodside and is named after their Old Windsor estate with the apples coming from their orchard.

A source said the couple do not have commercial plans for Woodside as of yet but their celebrity pals like Victoria and Elizabeth are eager for a sample.

Elton's luxurious estate is said to span 37 acres which includes eight acres of woodlands and a vegetable patch.

The estate also features several manicured gardens and a £1million tram carriage Elton had shipped from Australia.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Elton John for comment. 

It comes after Elton and Taron Egerton recently reunited for a garden lunch after not seeing each other since January.

The pair became fast friends after Taron, 30, portrayed Elton in Rocketman, a film about his life which won rave reviews.

Elton took to Instagram and shared a snap of the pair standing in front of a garden hedge with Taron holding a Yorkshire Terrier.

Alongside the snap, Elton wrote: 'Lunch in the garden with this lovely man. We haven’t seen each other since the Golden Globes. Love him so much ❤️'.

The actor won Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes for his portrayal of the legendary musician.

Taken by surprise when he won the award, Taron forgot to thank Elton while he was on stage and spoke about the moment on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show.

He explained: 'I do regret that, I left Elton John hanging when I was winning an award for playing Elton John.

'But you know what? You aren't in your right kind of mind in that moment, I also made the great faux pas of forgetting to thank the HFPA [Hollywood Foreign Press Association] who vote on the Golden Globes.

'You're just not thinking straight and I haven't had a lot of practice at winning awards so I didn't nail it.'

Taron stressed that Elton wasn't bothered by the incident, and added that 'the rest of the awards show we were holding hands.'
