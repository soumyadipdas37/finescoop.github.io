Piers Morgan branded Madonna 'embarrassing and pathetic' during a hilarious Good Morning Britain rant on Tuesday.

The broadcaster claimed the pop star is trying to 'act like her boyfriends' following news that she was set to direct her own biopic.

Despite co-host Susanna Reid trying to defend Madonna by insisting she was just 'getting older,' Piers claimed she was still acting like she was '62 going on 20.'

Fuming: Piers Morgan branded Madonna 'embarrassing and pathetic' during a hilarious Good Morning Britain rant on Tuesday following news she would be directing her own biopic

Following news that Madonna would be at the helm of a film documenting her decades in the spotlight, Piers ranted that her music had never reached the peak of her 1980s heyday.

As Susanna reminded him of her hit single Holiday, he said: 'When she did Holiday, she was the best pop star in the world. No question.

'Now it's just pathetic watching Madonna now. Pathetic. Everybody finds her pathetic and now we're having a biopic.'

Rage: Despite co-host Susanna Reid trying to defend Madonna by insisted she was just 'getting older,' Piers claimed she was still acting like she was '62 going on 20'

Susanna questioned why Piers had a problem with Madonna, aside from the fact that she was 'getting older.'

Piers then went on: 'She's 62 now going on 20. The act doesn't work. It's embarrassing.

'She doesn't know how to age gracefully. She's trying to act the age of her boyfriends. I think the latest one's about - what is he, 18? They're always older than her kids, I know that.'

Exciting: It comes just hours after Madonna announced she would be directing her own biopic, and will co-write the motion picture with Academy Award winner Diablo Cody

Madonna is currently in a relationship with dancer Ahlamalik Williams, who aged 27 is 35 years her junior, and is the latest in a long line of younger partners for the popstar.

It comes just hours after Madonna announced she would be directing her own biopic, and will co-write the motion picture with Academy Award winner Diablo Cody.

The movie will take viewers on 'the incredible journey that life has taken me on as an artist, a musician, a dancer - a human being, trying to make her way in this world,' she said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Teaming up: The superstar has hinted about the project in past social media posts which saw her working on a new script

The Grammy-winner said that 'the focus of this film will always be music,' which has 'kept [her] going and ... alive.

'There are so many untold and inspiring stories and who better to tell it than me. It’s essential to share the roller coaster ride of my life with my voice and vision.'

The Material Girl will collaborate with Amy Pascal on the project, as they past worked on the 1992 classic A League of Their Own.

'This movie is an absolute labour of love for me,' Pascal said. 'I have known Madonna since we made A League of Their Own together, and I can’t imagine anything more thrilling than collaborating with her and Diablo on bringing her true-life story to the big screen with' Universal's Donna Langley and the studio.

Langley called the Papa Don't Preach artist 'the ultimate icon, humanitarian, artist and rebel,' adding, 'With her singular gift of creating art that is as accessible as it is boundary-pushing, she has shaped our culture in a way very few others have.'
