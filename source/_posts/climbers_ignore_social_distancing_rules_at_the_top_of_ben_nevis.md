Shocking photographs have captured a long queue of hikers as they ignore social distancing rules to wait for a selfie at the top of Ben Nevis.     

The images were taken by Lisa Smol, 39, as she made her way to the peak of the UK's highest mountain on August 8. 

More than 50 people can be seen queuing in close proximity as they wait to reach the Cairn and Trig point at the summit of Ben Nevis in Lochaber, Scotland. 

The teacher, from the Highlands, said the trail was the 'busiest she has ever seen it' despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 41,366 people in the UK.

Photographs were taken from two sides of the summit, with a queue of hikers seen pressed closely together as they waited to take pictures at the peak.

There appears to be very little social distancing in place with at least 50 people crammed at the top of the 4413ft mountain.

Another image shows the queue snaking its way down the summit as people make their descent from the point. 

Ms Smol shared the images to social media on August 9, claiming it was the busiest she had ever seen the trail.

She wrote: 'A different view yesterday. A queue for that Ben Nevis summit photo.

'Busy times up there but still beautiful. Stay safe.'

Social media users were quick to condemn the hikers for standing too closely together.

Michael Annis said: 'This is insane. Aberdeen closing down, football game cancelled and people do this.'  

'Not much social distancing there and no trace tracking if one of them is ill,' added Jennifer Hall.  

Laura Hay said: 'Oh my god. I go walking in the hills to get away from people.'      

Speaking today, Ms Smol said: 'I had heard from previous hikers it was busy, but I was still shocked to see a queue to reach the Cairn and Trig point.

'I think it was busier than usual due to bad weather earlier in the week, which probably altered many initial midweek hikes and pushed it back to the weekend, plus it was the summer holidays for the whole of the UK.

'Although Ben Nevis gets busy this was extreme. I haven't seen it that busy before. I teach so I always try to make the most of the holidays and weekends.'

Last year, images emerged of a large queue on top of Snowdon and Pen-Y-Fan Mountain in Wales during the Easter holidays.     

 Tragedy also struck on Everest in May last year, where four mountaineers died after an astonishing photo emerged of a queue of climbers waiting to reach the summit

The photos led to calls from The British Mountaineering Council for more investment in busy mountains to deal with overcrowding. 

Tragedy also struck on Everest in May last year, where four mountaineers died after an astonishing photo emerged of a queue of climbers waiting to reach the summit.

An Irish man, a Nepalese guide and two Indian climbers, including a woman, died of exhaustion while descending the world's highest peak.
