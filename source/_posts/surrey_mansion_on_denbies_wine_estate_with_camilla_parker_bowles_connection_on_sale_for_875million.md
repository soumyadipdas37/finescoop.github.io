A sprawling Surrey mansion once owned by Camilla Parker Bowles' grandfather, where she reportedly spent much of her childhood, is on sale for £8.75million.

The Denbies House, near Dorking, is situated on a historic country estate high up in the Surrey Hills - an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - with far-reaching views of the North Downs and the Denbies Wine Estate - England's largest vineyard.

The original Denbies mansion was knocked down and rebuilt by London builder Thomas Cubitt after he purchased it in 1850, before later being demolished again in 1953. The current home, previously used as staff quarters, boasts seven bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool, extensive cellars and a leisure suite as well as four additional properties.

Thomas Cubitt, renowned for creating Belgravia, parts of Bloomsbury and the east front of Buckingham Palace, is believed to have become familiar with the North Downs countryside while building Polesden Lacey, an Edwardian house close to the estate which is now owned and run by the National Trust.

He acquired Denbies 25 years later from Jonathan Tyers - the proprietor of New Spring Gardens, which later became known as Vauxhall Gardens, a popular pleasure garden in Kennington, London - who transformed the original farmhouse and grounds into a weekend retreat.

Cubitt replaced the moderate sized Regency-style house with a large Victorian mansion similar to Osborne House, the home he built on the Isle of Wight together with Prince Albert, used by Queen Victoria as a holiday home. 

He also employed the landscape architect who laid out St James' Park, W.A. Nesfield, to advise him on developing the grounds of the estate.

It is believed Prince Albert visited Denbies in July 1851 and also offered Cubitt advice on overhauling the landscaping while planting several rare conifer trees to mark his visit. Specimens of rare plants and shrubs were added which Cubitt sourced from his friend William Hooker, the then-director of Kew Gardens.

When it became too costly to run, the old mansion was stripped, the furniture sold off and its flooring and doors incorporated into Lord Ashcombe's new house - the current Denbies House. It was later demolished following a fire, though the basement remains today and a lake is situated in its place (pictured)

When Thomas Cubitt died on the estate in 1855, Denbies passed to his eldest son George, a politician, who who continued the development and expansion of the property and local area and became the first Lord Ashcombe after he was elevated to a peerage in 1892. 

He continued to extend the estate, adding a further 2,000 acres of land and employing 400 workers. It remained the seat of the Cubitt family, with Lord Ashcombe's son Henry inheriting the title and extensive estate after the death of his father in 1917.

However, the hefty death duties and pricey upkeep of large estates during the First World War saw large swathes of the estate auctioned off in September 1921. The break up of the estate continued after Henry's death in October 1947 when it was inherited by his fourth son Roland, who became the third Lord Ashcombe - the Duchess of Cornwall's maternal grandfather. 

Roland's daughter Rosalind Cubitt married Major Bruce Shand in 1946, and a young Camilla is said to have spent some of her holidays at Denbies learning to ride.

Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate; staffing became a problem while soaring maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. During the conflict a section of the mansion was requisitioned by the The Home Guard for its headquarters and a training school was based there.

Around this time, Roland Cubitt transformed the building once used as a residence for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house - which is The Denbies House currently on sale.

The old mansion was stripped, the furniture sold off and its flooring and doors incorporated into Lord Ashcombe's new house. It was later demolished following a fire, though the basement remains today. 

The Denbies estate was last sold to its current owner in May 1984. The Denbies Wine Estate was established by Adrian White in 1986, after he initially trialled it as a pig farm, when a neighbour pointed out the bowl shape of the land matched the Champagne country of France.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visited the vineyard in 2011 and bought 30 cases of rosé for the Duke of Edinburgh's 90th birthday celebrations. 

The magnificent Denbies House, which comes with approximately 58 acres of land and is listed with Savills estate agency, boasts a reception hall with a sweeping staircase, a drawing room, dining room, sitting room, family room, study, kitchen and utility rooms.
