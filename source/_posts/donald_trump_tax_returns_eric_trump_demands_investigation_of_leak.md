Eric Trump defended his father Tuesday from a bombshell investigation that charges he engaged in massive tax avoidance – and is demanding a leak investigation over a New York Times expose focused on the IRS.

Trump, who helps run the Trump Organization, said there are 'a ton' of inaccuracies in the story, although he did not identify any. 'My father pays a fortune in taxes.'

He called New York Times journalists who produced the story 'disgusting' and demanded an investigation of the IRS.

'They've been writing that article for three months, and they wanted to drop it the morning before the debate. These are disgusting people,' he said during a morning appearance on Fox & Friends.

'Why is no one talking about the IRS? The IRS - somebody at the IRS leaked the documents. I really believe that this is the IRS scandal of this generation,' he said.

'Now they're targeting my father because he's doing a great job and they don't like him,' he said.

President Trump has attacked the Times report on his tax returns as 'fake' 

Trump was revealed to have paid just $750 in federal individual taxes in 2016 and again in 2017

He put the story, which came out Sunday with another installment Monday night, in the context of other recent bombshells – including one in the Atlantic that quoted sources saying Trump called U.S. troops 'suckers' and 'losers,' and Bob Woodward's book there Trump told the journalist he played down the coronavirus. 

'You better believe that every single day between now and election they're going to have another quote unquote October surprise. I mean first it was the Atlantic Story and then it was the Bob Woodward book and now it's the New York Times nonsense and they try to discredit my father,' he said. 

'We've got a great company .. We've got the best assets in the world,' he said of the real estate, golf and branding empire that emerges in new detail for the first time in the Times report. 

'Any person in the world would envy to be in Donald Trump's shoes. He truly is the American dream ... Guys, they're disgusting but somebody better look into the IRS. 

The Times expose, which reveals Trump paid personal income taxes of just $750 in 2016 and has suffered huge losses in his golf and business empire totaling $421 million, with $300 million coming due in the next four years. It notes that multiple sources have gained access to tax return information, including prosecutors, attorneys, the IRS, and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which has a role in large audits. House Democrats have been trying to get the returns for years without success. 

Eric Trump pointed to the IRS as the source of the information, but the Times did not identify its sources, and others had access to the information

Eric spoke after his brother Donald Trump Jr suggested people were better off looking into Joe Biden's son Hunter's financial dealings.

Downplaying the company's huge reported losses and minimal tax contribution, Trump Jr said: 'It's ridiculous, my father has paid tens of millions of taxes.

'If he does things in certain years where you get depreciation, where you get write-off, where you get historical tax credits like we did when we took on the risk of building the old Post Office in DC, that was literally a government contract.'

The General Services Administration leased the historic building to a consortium headed by DJT Holdings LLC, a holding company that Trump owns through a revocable trust. 

The Old Post Office hotel qualified for a historic-preservation tax break.    

Trump Jr continued: 'We bid against every hotel company in the world, historical tax credits that you use to offset tax payments for taking the risk to build that. That was done under the Obama administration.

'It literally took an act of Congress to get it done. So with that comes historical tax credits. That's the reality. People don't understand what goes into a business.

'It doesn't include property taxes, it doesn't include payroll taxes, it doesn't include real estate taxes, it doesn't include so many of the things he's been paying taxes on for ever as he's also putting thousands and thousands of people to work on an annual basis.'

TRUMP PAID JUST $750 IN TAXES IN BOTH 2016 and 2017.

The newspaper said Trump initially paid $95 million in taxes over the 18 years it studied. But he managed to recover most of that money by claiming — and receiving — a stunning $72.9 million federal tax refund. 

According to the Times, Trump also pocketed $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which are typically based on federal filings.

Trump’s outsize refund became the subject of a now-long-standing Internal Revenue Service audit of his finances. The audit was widely known. Trump has claimed it was the very reason why he cannot release his returns. But the Times report is the first to identify the issue that was mainly in dispute.

As a result of the refund, Trump paid an average $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2000 to 2017, the Times reported. By contrast, the average U.S. taxpayer in the top .001% of earners paid about $25 million annually over the same time-frame.

TRUMP HAS FINANCED AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE WITH THE USE OF BUSINESS EXPENSES

From his homes, his aircraft — and $70,000 on hair styling during his television show “The Apprentice” — Trump has capitalized on cost incurred from his businesses to finance a luxurious lifestyle.

The Times noted that Trump’s homes, planes and golf courses are part of the Trump family business and, as such, Trump classified them as business expenses as well. Because companies can write off business expenses as deductions, all such expenses have helped reduce Trump’s tax liability.

MANY OF HIS BEST-KNOWN BUSINESSES ARE MONEY-LOSERS

The president has frequently pointed to his far-flung hotels, golf courses and resorts as evidence of his success as a developer and businessman. Yet these properties have been been draining money.

The Times reported that Trump has claimed $315 million in losses since 2000 on his golf courses, including the Trump National Doral near Miami, which Trump has portrayed as a crown jewel in his business empire. Likewise, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has lost $55 million, the Times reported.

FOREIGN VISITORS HAVE HELPED SUPPORT TRUMP’S PROPERTIES

Since Trump began his presidential run, lobbyists, foreign governments and politicians have lavished significant sums of money on his properties, a spending spree that raised questions about its propriety and legality.

The Times report illustrates just how much that spending has been: Since 2015, his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has taken in $5 million more a year from a surge in membership. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association spent at least $397,602 in 2017 at Trump’s Washington hotel. Overseas projects have produced millions more for Trump — $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.

TRUMP WILL FACE FINANCIAL PRESSURE AS DEBTS COME DUE

Trump seems sure to face heavy financial pressures from the enormous pile of debt he has absorbed. The Times said the president appears to be responsible for $421 million in loans, most of which will come due within four years. On top of that, a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower in New York will come due in 2022.
