The actor was dressed casually in a t-shirt and shorts and made sure to wear a face mask.

He enjoyed his  refreshments while seated alone at an outdoor table at the cafe and socially distanced from others.

The only exemption would be for someone who was passing through a restricted state and spent less than 24 hours there.
