A playful bear was caught blowing bubbles in the water as it attempted to entertain itself on a hot summers day and cool off in a muddy puddle.  

Kim Williams, 65, had been checking her trail camera in the mountains of south Montana, this summer when she spotted the 300kg black bear lying belly down in the cool water.

The retired postal worker then described how the large mammal submerged its snout beneath the muddy waters a number of times in order to blow the bubbles.

The mammal lies with its belly down as it lifts its head from side-to-side and continues to create the funny effect with its snout.

Following the scenes, Ms Williams said: 'As soon as I spotted it blowing bubbles, I couldn't stop laughing. I've never seen a bear do anything like it.

'It looked like it was playing like a dog might with their water bowl. I found it really funny seeing an animal so big act so playfully.

'It stayed there for five minutes doing this before walking away. I suppose bears have to find different things to keep themselves entertained on a hot summer day.

'I've had a trail camera in the area for a few years now and have regularly seen bears cooling off, but never do anything like this.

'They will come down and lie there as I think the mud helps keep the insects away, and others will just drink the water.

'I had to move the trail camera to a higher position as the bears used to paw at it and sometimes steal it.

'Even now they will climb the tree and mess with it.' 

Following the comical antics, viewers took to social media to share their thoughts on the care-free bear.

One user wrote: 'Funniest thing I've seen all day!'

Anther person said: 'Ugh I wish I could live that life.'

Black bears are solitary creatures that typically live in forests but can also be found in mountains and swamps across North America, Canada and Mexico.

They feature small rounded ears, fur that can vary from blue-gray, blue-black, brown, cinnamon, or even on rare occasions white, and short non-retractable claws which aid them in climbing trees. 

The creatures will spend the winter months dormant in their dens and will feed on the body fat they have built up over the summer and autumn months.
