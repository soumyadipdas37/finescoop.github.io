An Amazon delivery driver was caught on camera brazenly letting himself into a customer's home in order to deliver a package.

Rufaro Chitima, 30, from Dudley, West Midlands, had been at home when the driver opened her front door and left her Amazon parcel inside her property.

The makeup artist and lash technician, who was left 'lost for words', said she later received an email from Amazon which claimed the parcel 'had been handed to the resident'. 

The Amazon delivery driver approaches the front door of the house in Dudley, West Midlands, and pushes down on the door handle

During the CCTV footage, which was filmed on September 3, the delivery driver walks towards Ms Chitima's front door and pushes down the door handle without knocking.

As the door swings open, the Amazon worker bends down and deposits the package inside the hall, leaning over the doorstep to place it on the floor.

He then shuts the door behind him and walks away from the property without a second glance.

A few seconds later, the door opens again as Ms Chitima investigates how the parcel ended up inside her house.

Shortly after the delivery, the shocked makeup artist received an email from Amazon asking her to rate the driver's performance.

The email dated on September 3 read: 'Parcel was handed to resident'.

Ms Chitima later took to social media to complain to Amazon about her delivery in a message which read: 'Lost for words. When did it become acceptable for an Amazon driver to let themselves into your home?'

A member of Amazon's social media team has since replied to the customer's video and asked for further details about the delivery.

In response to Ms Chitima's post on Facebook, Amazon wrote: 'We'd like to have a member of our Transportation team look into this for you. At your earliest convenience, please submit your tracking and order number here.' 

An Amazon spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We have reached out to the customer to offer our support. We have investigated the matter and are taking appropriate action.'
