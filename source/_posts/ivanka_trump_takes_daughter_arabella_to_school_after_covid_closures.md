Ivanka Trump was dressed to impress as she stepped out of her Washington, D.C. home on Thursday morning and took her nine-year-old daughter Arabella to school for the first time since the COVID-19 closures. 

The 38-year-old White House senior adviser looked ready for fall in a $1,295 tan and red wrap coat by Gabriela Hearst, which she wore over a matching turtleneck and red pants.   

Arabella, who made first appearance at one of her grandfather's MAGA rallies on Tuesday night, was dressed in a school uniform: a white blouse with a Peter Pan collar, a navy blue jumper, and black Mary Janes. 

Back to school: Ivanka Trump was seen taking her nine-year-old daughter Arabella to school on Thursday morning 

Both mother and daughter wore fabric face masks that matched their outfits, with Ivanka sporting a leopard print and Arabella opting for a playful blue Star Wars-themed one.

Although most of her face was covered, the little girl looked excited to be heading to school, but she didn't appear to have a backpack with her. She carried a few things in her hands, including what looked like a hot pink water bottle. 

Ivanka, who was headed to Wisconsin and Minnesota with Vice President Mike Pence later in the day, was ready to hit the ground running when she stepped out of the front gate of home in her sky-high tan heels around 8:20 a.m.

Her long blonde hair, which is usually worn straight, was styled in loose waves, and while only half of her face was visible because of her mask, she was sporting smokey eye makeup and perfectly sculpted brows. 

The mother and daughter made their way to the Secret Service SUV that was parked in front of their home, and they they were off for the day.  

Ivanka's younger sons Joseph, six, and Theodore, four, were not with them when they left, and it's unclear if they have returned to their classrooms amid the pandemic or still doing remote learning.  

Early bird: Ivanka's husband, fellow White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was seen leaving their home at 7:40 a.m. on Thursday 

Her husband, fellow White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, got an earlier start on Thursday morning. The 39-year-old was seen leaving their home around 7:40 a.m. wearing a navy suit and matching tie.   

With the presidential election just weeks away, Ivanka has been spending most of her work days traveling to battleground states to stump for her father. 

After dropping off her daughter, she took to Twitter to share how excited she is to be back on the campaign trail. 

'I am thrilled to be back in the great states of Wisconsin and Minnesota today with Vice President @MikePence today as we campaign for 4 more years of Trump / Pence leadership! #MAGA,' she tweeted on Thursday. 

On Tuesday evening, Ivanka and Jared traveled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with their eldest children Arabella and Joseph to attend President Donald Trump's raucous rally.
