An urgent recall has been issued for a plant-based protein powder sold in Woolworths stores across the country.

The Keep it Cleaner chocolate flavoured 375g protein powder has been recalled nationally due to the presence of an undeclared allergen - dairy.

Those with a dairy allergy or intolerance are at risk of suffering a reaction if they consume the product.

'Consumers who have a dairy allergy or intolerance should not consume this product,' Food Standards Australia said. 

The product features the best before date of July 3, 2022. 

Customers are urged to return the protein powder to the place of purchase for a full refund
