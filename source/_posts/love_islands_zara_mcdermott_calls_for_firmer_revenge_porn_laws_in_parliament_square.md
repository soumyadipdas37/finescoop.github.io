Zara McDermott joined domestic abuse charity, Refuge in Parliament Square on Thursday to lobby for changes in rules about revenge porn. 

The Love Island star, 24, has been making a documentary over the past year about her experiences with the horrendous attack and has since made it a passion project to help victims and lobby lawmakers over the crime.  

Refuge is calling for anyone who threatens to share intimate photographs of another person without their consent to face prosecution. A law against disclosing intimate photos came into force in 2015 but the charity wants to see this strengthened.

Zara joined Refuge ambassador and domestic abuse survivor Natasha Saunders and Refuge policy manager Cordelia Tucker O'Sullivan outside Parliament.

She is joining charity officials in calling for an amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill when it returns to the House of Lords in the coming days.

According to Refuge data, one in seven young women have been threatened this way despite the law against revenge porn - often by current or former partners.

The charity says victims face barriers to justice because the act of making these threats is not yet a criminal offence.
