He's the loving father of two teenage sons and Jeff Brazier paid tribute to his youngest boy, Freddie, on Monday, 

Sharing a series of snaps of him surrounded by balloons, including silver '16 balloons', Jeff, 41, wrote a sweet caption to go alongside it.  

He wrote: 'It’s not for parents to define a child’s purpose but if this kid doesn’t help thousands of people somehow I’ll be very surprised.

His boy: Jeff Brazier paid tribute to son Freddie on Instagram on Monday as he turned 16 and praises his 'sense of adventure, energy and enthusiasm and sensitivity around others'

'I’d give anything to have @freddybraz1er’s sense of adventure, energy and enthusiasm to have fun and depth and sensitivity around caring for others.

'Excited for him to get the academic phase done this year so he can unleash his creative gifts on the world.'

He wrote the hashtags: '#parenting #children #teenagers #emotionalintelligence #creativity #adventure #fatherandson #brazierboys.'

Kind words: He accompanied the series of pictures with a sweet post about how much Freddie means to him 

Jeff is also dad to model Bobby, 17, from his relationship with Jade Goody, who sadly passed away in 2009 from cancer. 

Earlier this month, Jeff insisted his marriage to his wife Kate is stronger than ever as the couple celebrated their second wedding anniversary following a turbulent 12-months. 

The presenter paid tribute to Kate on social media as they stepped out for a romantic meal in east London to celebrate the special day, shortly after admitting they had to 'pause and reset' their marriage in 2019.  

Memories: Among the images, were throwback snaps of Freddie with Jeff and his stepmother Kate

Taking to Instagram, Jeff shared a snap of himself and Kate as they dined out at Shoreditch steak restaurant Blacklock alongside a lengthy caption in which he reflected on their ups and downs since exchanging vows. 

He wrote: 'Had such a lovely time celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary yesterday that I forgot to do the Instagram post! 

'We did all the things we loved, Par 3 golf, @fredanddougs, @davidlloyduk to train & sit and read in the spa & then one of our favourite restaurants to finish up.'

He added: 'The key for us reaching 2 years in style? (@katebrazierpr and I are stronger now than we’ve ever been).

'Own our flaws, share them, take responsibility for improving them, invest time into finding things we love to do together & acknowledge that the way you communicate with one another is massive but especially so when one of us is ‘triggered’

'Also recognise that what you brought into the relationship could be the undoing of it unless you’re brave enough to embrace the vulnerability.

'So if like us, you’re in a relationship that’s strong enough to support the growth you’re both going through, you’re always in with a shout.

'Proud of how far we’ve come @katebrazierpr and thank you for a lovely day yesterday.'
