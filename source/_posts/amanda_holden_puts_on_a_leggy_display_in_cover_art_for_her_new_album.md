The TV star has been busy filling in for Simon Cowell as head judge on Britain's Got Talent, yet still found time to squeeze in some much needed relaxation time as she enjoyed a romantic getaway to Cliveden House in Berkshire last weekend.

Mother-of-two Amanda put on a very loved-up display with her husband Chris Hughes during the trip.

Taking to her social media platform, she said: 'Had the best #romantic #weekend with #Chrispy in this historic and infamous place steeeeped in history.

Happy couple: The TV star recently enjoyed a romantic getaway to Cliveden House in Berkshire with husband Chris Hughes 

'Thank you to all the staff for looking after us so well... NOT an #ad ( thanks to John on the door for humouring me by taking this pic early this morning)'. (sic)

Cliveden house is a popular spot for celebs and has hosted an array of famous faces over the years including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charlie Chaplin.

The property, once owned by William Waldorf Astor, was also the hotel where Meghan Markle stayed the night before her wedding to Price Harry in 2018.
