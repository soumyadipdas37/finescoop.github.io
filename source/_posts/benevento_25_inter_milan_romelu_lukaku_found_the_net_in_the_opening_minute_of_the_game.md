Inter Milan enjoyed a high-scoring victory of 5-2 against Benevento in their second game of the 2020-2021 campaign. 

Romelu Lukaku added two goals to his tally, while Benevento - who beat Sampdoria 3-2 in their first game back in the top flight - struggled to keep up their winning ways as they slipped back into their 2017-18 form.  

The hosts did, however, manage to put two past Antonio Conte's men.  







Inter Milan's first goal came in the opening minute of the game as Romelu Lukaku slotted home his first of the game.

Inter's next two goals from Roberto Gagliardin and Achraf Hakimi came in quick succession, with the first coming in the 25th minute and the second in the 28th minute. 

Benevento clawed one back with a right footed shot from Gianluca Caprari that flew into the bottom left corner of the goal.  

Achraf Hakimi scored a right footed shot from the centre of the box to the bottom right corner in the 42nd minute of the game.  

Before Lautaro Martinez punished Benevento in the 71st minute after being assisted by Alexis Sanchez. 

Benevento did, however, finish the game off well with Caprari picking up another goal. Gianluca Lapadula set Caprari up for a right footed shot from the centre of the box to the bottom left corner.
