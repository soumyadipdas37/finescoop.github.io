Australians can more than double their annual leave with a simple holiday hack.

Workers can get up to 48 days off without going over the 20-day limit by strategically booking time away when public holidays meet weekends in 2021.

Holidaymakers can get ten days off between Christmas Day and January 3 while only taking three days of leave between December 29 and 31.

The remaining seven days are either weekends or public holidays.
