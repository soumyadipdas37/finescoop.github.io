Musician Jaden was set to hit the road this summer and tour with Justin Bieber and Kehlani, but plans changes as entertainment and touring industry has shut down amid the ongoing pandemic.

Jaden recently chatted about his current creative direction with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, and how he's been honing his musical craft amid the downtime of the quarantine.

'I just wanted to be able to really listen into different types of style of music, and pull in different inspirations that I could use for my own music, whether that be vocal harmonies, whether that be different types of pedals on guitar, whether that be playing guitar in general, you know?' he said.

He continued:  'Now I’m just, through this quarantine I’m just trying to get better and better and better.

He said he still has work to do 'being able to play guitar,' but he's OK with his progress as a guitar player.

'The fact that I can play a few songs and I can do this, and I can practice singing on guitar, that’s what I really care about,' he said. 'Because now, I can have a personal connection with the instrument, where it helps me to express emotions.' 

The latest: Last month Jaden premiered the music video for his new single Cabin Fever, which depicts a courtship in modern times amid quarantine and social upheaval
