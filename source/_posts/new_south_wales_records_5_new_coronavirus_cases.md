New South Wales has recorded another five new coronavirus cases as fears surround a cluster growing at a Sydney pub.

Two infections have come from those in hotel quarantine while another two are linked to a known cluster.

The other new case recorded on Thursday is still under investigation but has been locally acquired. 

One of the cases had attended the Eastern Suburbs Legion Club in Waverly in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The cluster at the pub has now grown to nine.  

NSW has recorded five new cases of COVID-19 with two in hotel quarantine (two women wear face masks in Circular Quay)

Diners who attended a thai restaurant in Casual in Sydney's south-west have also been urged to get tested immediately. 

'Anyone who attended the Five Stars Thaitanic, Casula on Saturday 12 September from 4.20pm-5.20pm is considered a casual contact and must monitor for symptoms and get tested immediately if they develop,' NSW Health said.

'After testing, they must remain in isolation until a negative test result is received.'

More to come.
