Her former Bachelor in Paradise co-star Jamie Doran bizarrely professed his love for her recently. 

But Helena Sauzier proved she had no interest in the unlucky-in-love 40-year-old as she packed on the PDA with her new boyfriend Tom Slingsby on Sunday. 

The reality star, 25, looked very much smitten with the Australian sailor as they enjoyed a morning coffee date in Sydney.

Helena and Tom couldn't peel their attention away from each other as they embarked on their low-key outing.

The blonde beauty flashed her taut abs in a monochrome sports bra and completed her off-duty sporty look with leggings and trainers.

The lovebirds briefly stopped their stroll to enjoy a kiss before continuing their journey to their local café.

Helena's new romance comes just weeks after her BIP castmate Jamie bizarrely professed his love for her after she was booted off the show.

After saying his goodbyes to the contestants, the 40-year-old fireman said: 'I just want to say that I think over the last 10 years, I've built some walls around myself and I let those walls down.'

'I felt I came on Paradise and I opened myself up and had feelings for Helena that I've actually never felt for anyone ever in my life,' he said at the time.

Sorry Jamie! This comes weeks after Helena confirmed her new romance with sailor Tom Slingsby, by sharing a series of photos to her Instagram account (pictured together)

After debuting her romance with Tom on Instagram three weeks earlier, it is evident Helena does not share mutual feelings with Jamie.

The 35-year-old sailor is the proud recipient of an Order of Australia (OAM), three consecutive world championships in sailing Laser dinghies and a 2012 Olympic Gold Medal under his belt.

Helena rose to fame after she appeared on Matt Agnew's season of The Bachelor.
