Self-proclaimed 'Aussie television super couple' Grant and Chezzi Denyer launched their new podcast IT'S ALL TRUE earlier this week. 

The candid podcast is about their 'drama-filled 10 year marriage' and promises to tell all of their stories 'no matter how god-awful, embarrassing or hilarious'. 

But on Thursday, Chezzi, 40, posted a selfie to Instagram with a caption suggesting the podcast was so honest that it completely changed them as a couple.

'We were all love and smiles before recording today’s IT’S ALL TRUE Podcast... We didn’t walk out looking this way though,' Chezzi wrote on Instagram. 

'More uncomfortable, sometimes funny, home truths shared again. Can’t say too much. You’ll have to wait til Monday to hear our next episode. But brace yourselves.'

While that may sound intense, Chezzi has previously said telling their uncomfortable stories is part of a 'cathartic' process for the couple.

'What we’ve spoken about on this week’s episode and next week’s episode isn’t always easy to discuss.. but it does feel very cathartic being able to speak freely and our hope is that we may help others with our stories!' Chezzi said on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Grant wrote: 'There’s a fair bit of pain you have to relive when talking about these things, and it’s easy for me to feel lots of shame.' 

On Monday's episode, Grant revealed how his life went downhill during an addiction to painkillers.  

The 43-year-old Family Feud host was on a concoction of Endone and morphine while recovering from a broken back injury after a monster truck accident.

The side effects from his drug use were so bad that the star once woke up surrounded by faeces and believed his wife was being raped by an intruder.

Mad sh*t that went on …. when I closed my eyes and couldn't tell the difference between reality and my dream,' he said on his It's All True podcast on Monday. 

'I remember waking up thinking there was a home invasion and I thought that Chezzi was being attacked, being raped in the apartment.

'I'm trying to find these guys who are attacking you and raping you. I'm like, "Where are they? I know they're here! Where are they?"'
