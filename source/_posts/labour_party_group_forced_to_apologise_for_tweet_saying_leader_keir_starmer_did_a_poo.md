A Labour party group has been forced to apologise for an 'unauthorised' childish tweet which said Sir Keir Starmer 'did a poo'.

The post was quickly deleted but not before it was shared and retweeted hundreds of times.

The blunder mocking the opposition leader was made by the Whitstable and Canterbury Labour Party, in Kent.

A Labour party group has been forced to apologise for an 'unauthorised' childish tweet which said Sir Keir Starmer, pictured, 'did a poo'

The post, pictured, was quickly deleted but not before it was shared and retweeted hundreds of times

It was posted on Tuesday to its 2,100 followers before the local party group then put out a grovelling apology.

It read: 'There has tonight been an unauthorised tweet on this account which has been deleted.

'Apologies for this especially as it demonstrated a lack of Labour Socialist values.'

The apology was met with hundreds of hilarious comments mocking the gaffe.

One user wrote: 'The number two is seconded.'

One more wrote: 'Gives a whole new meaning to the term 'The Labour movement'.'

And another stated: 'Well said. Everyone knows that Sir Keir only ever crowns and never fully evacuates.'

Others were confused at why taking a dump was seen as un-Socialist.

Another said: 'Pooing is anti-socialist? Huge if true (like the poo, I hear).'

Other users were keen to admit that as socialists, they themselves had in fact pooed in the past.

One wrote: 'I'm a socialist and I poo all the time.'

Another tweeted: 'I'm as socialist as they come and my turds are frequent and massive.'

Others simply said: 'S*** happens.'

Rosie Duffield, the local MP, caused one of the biggest shocks of the 2017 election when she ousted veteran Tory Sir Julian Brazier to become Canterbury's first ever Labour MP, before then retaining the seat at the next vote two years later. 

The Whitstable and Canterbury Labour Party have been contacted for comment.
