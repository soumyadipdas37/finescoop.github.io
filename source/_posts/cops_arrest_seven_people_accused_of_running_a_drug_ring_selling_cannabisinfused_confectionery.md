An alleged drug ring supplying cannabis-infused confectionary and sweets through an online marketplace has been taken down by NSW police.

Detectives have charged five men and two women over their alleged involvement in supplying drugs - including drug-infused baked goods.

Officers found jelly lollies, chocolate and baked goods, along with cannabis and cannabis oil during a raid of a Sydney home on Sunday.

Superintendent Paul Carrett says online drug supply isn't new but it remains challenging for police and people should be wary.

Cops allegedly seized lollies, chocolate, baked good, cannabis and cannabis oil from the Sydney home after arresting seven people (some of the seized goods pictured)

'The sale of drug-infused goods in what looks like unsuspecting food items poses a significant risk to the community,' he said.

'Not only are these drugs illegal, they are also incredibly dangerous - you simply don't know what you're taking or how it will affect your health.'

Two 28-year-old Taiwanese men have been charged supplying prohibited drugs and dealing with proceeds of crime. One is also accused of possessing prohibited drugs.

A 27-year-old Taiwanese woman was also charged with possessing and supplying a prohibited drug and dealing with the proceeds of crime.

Police will allege the trio were involved in the supply of cannabis-infused baked goods through the website.

A 25-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were later charged with supplying prohibited drugs, dealing with proceeds of crime and participating in a criminal group.

Police allege the pair delivered the cannabis-infused confectionary to users at locations in Sydney's inner-city between July and August 2020.

Detectives have also arrested two French nationals during the ongoing investigation.

The pair, 31 and 30, are accused of supplying and possessing a prohibited drug and participating in a criminal group.

Police allege both also supplied MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy.
