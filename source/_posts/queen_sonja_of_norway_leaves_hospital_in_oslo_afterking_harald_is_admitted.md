The statement said: 'The king is now being examined. Covid-19 is already excluded.' 

King Harald who ascended to the throne after the death of his father King Olav on January 17 1991, was also admitted to hospital earlier this year and underwent two weeks sick leave.

Speaking at the time Crown Prince Haakon, said it was a difficult period for the family and his father was recovering from dizziness but no serious illness was found.

Crown Prince Haakon has stepped in for his father on several previous occasions including, when he became ill in April 2018 with congestion and pain in one foot.

King Harald who is the country's first native-born king since the 14th century, won the nation's hearts when he married a commoner and led the mourning in 2011 for the victims of mass killer Anders Behring Breivik.

He was also praised globally for a 2016 speech showing support for gay rights, saying: 'Norwegians are girls who love girls, boys who love boys, and girls and boys who love each other.'
