She's left her fans and admirers guessing as to whether she is expecting her third child with fiancé Robin Thicke.

And April Love Geary took to Instagram on Tuesday to gush over her beau as she shared a sweet snap of her sitting on the floor amid a display of rose petals. 

The model, 25, looked stunning in a coral mini dress as she declared her love for the 43-year-old singer, before sharing a cryptic snap about the responsibility of birth control.

The image saw April sitting in front of a romantic display which saw red rose petals shaped into a heart and scattered amid pillar candles. 

The beauty simply captioned the snap 'I love you' while tagging the Blurred Lines hitmaker.

It comes after April took to her Instagram stories to share a cryptic post about the responsibility of birth control.

In an apparent address to the ever increasing rumours that she's once again expecting, April re-posted a message which stated that men could impregnate numerous women and therefore should take more responsibility for birth control.

It said: 'One man can impregnate 9 women every day for 9 months. Those are 2,430 pregnancies.

'One woman can only get pregnant once within 9 months, even if she beds 9 men every day within 9 months. That’s only 1 pregnancy.

'So clearly, society is placing the birth control responsibilities on the wrong gender. Science is busy making pills, and hormone-altering devices for the wrong person.'

Robin and April, who have been together since 2015, already share two young children – daughters Mia Love, two, and Lola Alain, one.

Robin, 43, also has a 10-year-old son named Julian, whom he shares with his ex-wife, actress Paula Patton. 

At the beginning of this month, Us Weekly reported that the dynamic duo are now awaiting the arrival of their third little pride and joy.

She previously joked about getting pregnant again, posting a sexy black-and-white photo of Thicke to her Insta Story back in May, writing: 'GET ME PREGNANT AGAIN. jk don't but like omg.'

And while she has yet to confirm the pregnancy speculation, she did take to social media last month to brush off the internet trolls who have criticized her for her figure after she had two children.

'Just letting you know that I'm not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was "so much more attractive" when I was skinnier,' she said.

'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' April added cheekily.
