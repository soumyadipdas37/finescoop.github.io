The Czech Republic on Friday night dramatically claimed they had pulled the plug on Monday's Nations League clash with Scotland in Olomouc due to the coronavirus crisis.

The SFA were still awaiting confirmation from UEFA but it appears they will no longer be travelling for the second part of their opening double-header.

In a blow to plans to plough ahead during a global pandemic, the Czechs laid the blame for the decision directly at the door of the Covid crisis. 

Scotland started off their Nations League campaign with a 1-1 draw against Israel on Friday

In a Tweet on Friday night, the Czech FA said: 'The national team will not play against Scotland on Monday due to representatives decision and the current situation with the Covid-19'. 

The Czechs beat their former compatriots Slovakia 3-1 on Friday night. But the build-up had been marred by positive tests among the squad, with Tomas Soucek and Patrik Schick in quarantine.

SFA insiders were caught unaware on Friday night - and insisted they would have to have the situation confirmed by UEFA before changing plans.

UEFA stated this week that games would go ahead as long as a nation could name 13 players, including one reserve keeper. If they can, it will either be rescheduled or UEFA could even draw lots to decide the outcome. Scotland could also be awarded the tie.
