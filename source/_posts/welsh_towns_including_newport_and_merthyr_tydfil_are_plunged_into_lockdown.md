The areas of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Newport and Blaenau Gwent will be placed under a local lockdown following an increase of coronavirus cases, the Welsh Government has announced.

Health minister Vaughan Gething said there had been a 'worrying and rapid rise' in cases of Covid-19 in the four areas.

Under the measures, which come into force at 6pm on Tuesday, people must not enter or leave the areas without a reasonable excuse.

People are only able to meet outdoors and are unable to meet members of their extended household indoors.

All licensed premises will have to close at 11pm.

Last week, Caerphilly county borough and Rhondda Cynon Taf were also placed under local lockdown.
