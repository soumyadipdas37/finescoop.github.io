It's not every day you get to meet the woman behind one of Australia's most recognisable voices. 

So it's no wonder Today's weatherman Tim Davies was left awe-struck while interviewing Karen Jacobsen, the voice behind Australian 'Siri' on Monday. 

The interview took place in Tim's car as he drove the pair around Karen's hometown of Mackay Queensland. 

In a surreal twist, Karen meanwhile provided Tim with GPS-like driving instructions as she sat in the front passenger's seat.  

'You are not going to believe this! The real Siri, Karen Jacobson, is in the car with me! You have been telling me where to go for a long time,' Tim mused.

When the time came to give directions, Karen effortlessly fell into the soothing voice of Siri while telling Tim: 'Please continue straight ahead.'

Later in the interview, Karen spoke about having to leave her home in New York and return to Queensland due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The Australian-born blonde, who moved to New York 20 years ago, explained: 'We came here early in the piece and changed our flight about four times and here we are.'

Karen, who has a background in singing, is making good use of her time back Down Under by producing her own musical, Mackay to Manhattan - a Musical Memoir. 

The one-woman show tells the story of Karen's real-life journey of moving from Mackay to the Big Apple with dreams of making it big as an singer. 

'I love Mackay so much and I wrote a musical theatre,' she told Tim, adding: 'It's part concert, part motivational, and I'm sharing my story from the piano.'
