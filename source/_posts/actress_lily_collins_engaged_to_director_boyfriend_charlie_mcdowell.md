Lily Collins has announced she's engaged to director Charlie McDowell following a one-year romance.

The actress, 31, took to Instagram on Friday to share the happy news alongside images of the couple kissing and the moment he proposed during a romantic date. 

Les Misérables star Lily, who confirmed her relationship with The One I Love filmmaker, 37, last August, wrote: 'I’ve been waiting my lifetime for you and I can’t wait to spend our lifetime together...'.

The thespian also showed off her unique engagement ring, serving as her new statement piece of jewellery.  

The TV and film star cut a casual figure during the special moment as she opted for comfort in a multi-coloured jumper and wide-leg jeans.

Writer Charlie looked equally low-key in a grey T-shirt, a baseball cap and dark-wash jeans.

Many of their industry friends sent their well wishes on social media, with Ciara penning: 'Soooo happy for you! Love you Li Li boo! What a special day', while Ashley Tisdale, who recently announced she's pregnant, said: 'Congrats!!!!' (sic).

Late last year, the pair took their relationship to the next level as they adopted their rescue dog. 

Lily is the latest in a long line of A-List partners for Charlie, who directed The One I Love and The Discovery. 

The LA-born filmmaker has dated several high-profile actresses, including Emilia Clarke, 33, Hilary Duff, 32, and Rooney Mara, 34.

Charlie was in a relationship with Hilary for three months between September and December 2007.

The director then had a serious romance with Rooney for over six years from 2010, which came to an end in September 2016. 

Charlie and Game Of Thrones star Emilia confirmed they were dating in October 2018, but the relationship fizzled out. 

Lily has also had her fair share of headline-grabbing relationships, including a brief romance with her Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile co-star Zac Efron, 32, in 2012.

The brunette had an on/off romance with British actor Jamie Campbell Bower, 31, for five years after meeting on the set of The Mortal Instruments, but the pair called it quits for good in 2018.

Lily and Charlie both have famous parents in common; Lily's dad is British musician Phil Collins, while Charlie is the son of actor Malcolm McDowell and actress Mary Steenburgen.
