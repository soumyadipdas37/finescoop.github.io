A teenager who was stabbed to death in a 'revenge attack' when two gangs clashed has been remembered as a 'humble' and 'sweet' man who loved basketball.

The brawl between the groups of African youths began at about 5pm at O’Callaghan Park in Zillmere, in Brisbane's northern suburbs, on Sunday.

Girum Mekonnen, 19, died in the melee which left two others clinging to life in hospital.
