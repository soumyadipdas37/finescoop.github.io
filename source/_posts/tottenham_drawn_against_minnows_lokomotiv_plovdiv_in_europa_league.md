Tottenham will face Bulgarian minnows Lokomotiv Plovdiv in their opening fixture of the 2019-20 Europa League campaign. 

The official draw, conducted on Monday, has seen Jose Mourinho's side pitted against the relatively unknown outfit who are currently third in the Bulgarian league.

It is set to be a quite a culture shock for Spurs, who will leave their glamorous 62,000 state-of-the-art north London stadium to play inside Plovdiv's humble 13,000-seater arena.

The match will take place on September 17, with extra time and a penalty shootout if required.

Plovdiv were one of three opponents Mourinho's seeded side could have been drawn against, with the others being Aris from Greece or Laç from Albania.

Steven Gerrard's Rangers have been drawn to face Gibraltar side Lincoln Red Imps, who once stunned bitter rivals Celtic in the early stages of the Champions League.

During the 2016-17 season the Red Imps defeated Celtic 1-0 in Gibraltar to pull off the biggest shock of the early stages, before going on to lose 3-0 in Glasgow.

This time, in the one-off fixture, Rangers have been drawn away and must travel to the site of where their historic rivals were humiliated. 

In another interesting fixture served up by the competition, AC Milan are set to go up against Shamrock Rovers of Ireland. 

Scottish clubs Motherwell and Aberdeen face trips to Coleraine and Viking respectively. 

The draw took place at the House of European Football in Nyon, Switzerland.
