Imogen Anthony was downsizing her wardrobe on Monday, and she certainly dressed up for the occasion. 

The 29-year-old shared a photo to Instagram in which she was wearing a revealing lingerie ensemble. 

The look matched a pair of high-cut satin panties with thigh-high, lace top stockings in white that flaunted her trim pins.

She added a micro crop-top with long sleeves in a shimmering pearl fabric, the short cut showing off her toned stomach. 

Giving the ensemble a cheeky quality, Imogen put her caramel locks in pig tails, and opted for a peach-toned makeup palette with dramatic winged eyeliner.

In the photo, the Instagram model stood in front a rack of her designer clothing and explained she was downsizing and sending garments off to charity shops. 

Old duds: The influencer explained she was downsizing and sending garments off to charity shops. 'Keeping myself busy organising the archives. But the downside to having so many clothes, is having too many f***ing clothes. Let the donations begin' she wrote 

The influencer, who is known for her fashion-forward looks, wrote in the caption: 'Keeping myself busy organising the archives. 

'But the downside to having so many clothes, is having too many f***ing clothes. Let the donations begin.'   

Last month, the beauty got a brand new space-themed tattoo and couldn't help but show it off.

Designer duds! Imogen is known for her fashion-forward looks and love of high-end garments 

Edgy! The model also loves wearing cutting-edge designers and cult brands 

She shared a number of photos as well as a video clip to Instagram, giving fans a close-up view of the ink, and flashing her bottom in the process.   

'It's just a representation of the Universe, Golden Plaque from the Voyager (google search, pretty amazing) nature and animals, mother nature being destroyed, religion, aliens, all that kinda weird stuff,' she said of the new ink. 

'Also about religion shooting down any ideas of other life in the Universe. I'm weird.'
