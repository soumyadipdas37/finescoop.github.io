As she detailed issues with her placenta (similar to problems she faced during her pregnancies with Luna and Miles), she assured her followers not to worry about the baby and 'he's big.' 

'Oops! I'm stupid ... anyway,' she said. 'Its growing beautifully, everything's good. I'm feeling really good, but my placenta's really, really weak and it's causing me to really bleed a lot. Basically it's just pretty high-risk and, you know, it's just this poor thing has been through so much already.'

Hoping to lift her spirits, Chrissy showed off an adorable #bedrest donut arrangement with unicorn sweets made by celebrity favorite, Blinkie's Donuts from her friend Lauren Makk.

She took to Twitter just a few minutes later to joke about the perfect gender reveal.

'no fires and no one shot in the d**k,' she said while quote tweeting a fan.

She was ordered on to bed rest earlier this month while pregnant with her third child. 

Chrissy admitted on Instagram Tuesday evening that she wasn't so sure the parameters surrounding the doctor's orders and is now taking actions 'super seriously.'

She chatted with social media fans about her 'difficult pregnancy' and how she will move forward in the next few months to be 'as healthy as possible' for the sake of her unborn child.

Dressed in one of her signature silk kimonos, the Cravings queen laid back against a pillow while discussing her new pregnancy revelations. 

'I didn't really know that bed rest was, like, in bed,' she admitted. 'I honestly thought bed rest was you have to really really really relax, stay home; I thought it could be couch rest.'

Teigen was first ordered on bed rest earlier this month after fears she couldn't feel her baby moving.

'I really need it and now I'm in trouble,' she said. 'Just letting everyone know that if I have to bail on anything, it's because I'm on super serious bed rest times ... cause ya, trying to be as healthy as possible.'

Chrissy came back to her 31million followers on Wednesday with news that she was on 'day two' of bed rest.

'I got out of bed for five minutes yesterday, and in that five minutes, I still bled everywhere,' Teigen said. 'It's fun.' 

She went on to reveal that the third time around hasn't been as easy as when she was pregnant with Luna or Miles. 

'It's a bit of a difficult pregnancy,' she said. 'I feel good, though I will say I'm probably being punished for talking so much about how great the first two went.

'Now I get it. I get anyone that thinks it's not so awesome, but very happy to be carrying this baby.' 

Chrissy and husband John Legend announced their baby joy last month in his latest music video, Wild. 

They long struggled with infertility issues and had previously used in vitro fertilization treatments to assist in conceiving.
