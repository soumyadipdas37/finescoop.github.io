A daredevil window cleaner in the US filmed himself on a job - nearly 1,000 feet high off the ground. 

He was fixing leaky windows on the One Liberty Place skyscraper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when he took out his phone. 

The video shows incredible views of the city as he jokes: 'Don't fall, don't drop your phone.' 

Footage filmed on July 9, shows the window cleaner wearing a harness and ropes filming his reflection in the window. 

The man looks completely at ease as he leans back on the harness and chair and makes a hand gesture to the camera. 

He pans his phone around to show the city skyline from 1,000 feet in the air  as he says: 'Today's wonderful views. My job.'

Standing at 945 feet tall, One Liberty Place is the second-tallest building in Philadelphia.  

It was first completed in 1987 and was the city's first skyscraper.
