The grieving stepmum of a young father fatally stabbed on the Gold Coast has recalled their heartbreaking final conversation.

Raymond Harris, 27, was stabbed in the torso with what police described as a 'Rambo knife' during an altercation between two groups of men in Surfers Paradise on Wednesday night.

The father-of-four concreter was rushed to hospital where he died a short time later, hours before his eldest son's birthday.

Jye Sebastian Webb-Italia, 18, and Jarod James Miller, 21, have been charged with murder.

Stepmother Katherine Harris was shocked to hear about the death of her husband's son.

The couple last spoke to Raymond a few weeks prior. 

Raymond Harris (pictured), 27, was allegedly stabbed to death during a fight with a number of men that were known to him on Cavill Avenue near Orchid Avenue in Surfers Paradise at 9pm on Wednesday

'He told us he loved us both and we told him we loved him even more,' Ms Harris told NCA Newswire.

'I can't believe he is gone.'

She remembered Raymond as a devoted dad who wanted to spend as much time with his children as possible.

'He said to us a few weeks ago he wanted to be a strong man and be there for his kids,' she said.  

Her husband only recently reconciled with his son after the pair fell out over a work issue. 

'It's hard, because you think they will always be there,' Ms Harris said.

Raymond's shattered friends posted heartbreaking tributes on social media.

'I love you my brother! I miss you so much!! I can't believe I will never see you again you were my only friend and true Brother,'  Bradley O'Neill wrote.

'You will always be in my heart. I will miss all our fun times and things we would get up too.

'When I was depressed you would make sure to come see me and try to always make them better

'I hope your finally at rest brother. I will see you soon brother! I know your always walk with me.'

The mother of his young daughter also paid tribute, saying that she was 'thankful he came back' into his little's girl's life.

'I'll never be able to handle the fact that my little girl will never get to see her daddy again,' she wrote. 

'I'm so thankful that Hannie has you in her life and I'll forever be grateful of the happiness you brung to our daughter and that you loved her endlessly. 

'Rest In Peace Raymond, you'll be missed.'  

Meanwhile, the lawyer of one of the the men accused of murdering father Raymond Harris, 27, has said that his client is 'shocked' by the allegations and has no history of violence.

Jye Sebastian Webb-Italia, 18, and Jarod James Miller, 21, were both charged with one count of murder and three counts of common assault.

Webb-Italia was represented by TWC Lawyer's Rodney Keyte in Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday morning. 

His face-tattooed friend Miller also appeared in court and made a Legal Aid application.   

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Keyte said his client and his family were 'in a world of shock'. 

'He's obviously in shock as is his family. This is something, I'm instructed, that's never happened before,' he said. 

'Jye has obviously taken everything by shock. He's cut off from his family. It's hit him very hard.'  

Mr Keyte said the police allegations against Webb-Italia are 'very murky'.      

'What the police are alleging seems to be very murky,' he said. 

'They're going off CCTV footage and the action what they're describing is a slashing motion.' 

The lawyer confirmed a knife had been found near the scene but said there was no proof that it was the murder weapon.    

'A knife has been found within the vicinity of the deceased, it hasn't been confirmed that it was the murder weapon or even involved in the incident at all,' Mr Keyte said. 

Webb-Italia appeared in court on Thursday morning and his case was adjourned until October 15. 

The 18-year-old's co-accused Miller also appeared in court and will face court via videolink on October 15, unless he gets legal representation before then. 

Miller is a father of a young daughter and has facial tattoos on each side of his face. 

The tattoo on his right cheek says 'Stay true. BR. Laugh with many. Trust none', while the left cheek reads 'Damaged. No regrets'. 

He also has a number of tattoos on his arms and legs, including a number of skulls on his left leg and an anarchy symbol on his left knee.    

Raymond Harris was a concreter and devoted father-of-four who loved his kids

Police cars are seen near Orchard Avenue and Cavill Avenue after a man was fatally stabbed on Wednesday night 

Footage captured on Wednesday night showed the chaos as police cars surrounded the area.  

Pictures from the crime scene show blood stains, litter and clothes on the ground.  

It's understood children witnessed the alleged assault and stabbing.

'It was rather traumatic seeing it unfold...  There was a family with two children under five with their mum and dad,' one man wrote.

Another bystander came across the scene after finishing work.

'When I walked over at the end of my shift he was lying on the floor bleeding out, blood everywhere - the poor guy looked lifeless,' they wrote.

A local expressed concern about the safety of their neighbourhood. 

'I fear for mine and my partners life EVERY TIME we leave the house.... I can't wait to leave,' she wrote.

Two alleged stabbings have occurred around Orchard Avenue (pictured) in Surfers Paradise in the past 24 hours 

Police are still looking for two other men who could possibly assist with inquiries.  

They're fed up with 'young idiots' carrying knives and acting like they're playing were in a video game.

'This is just a group of young idiots,'Detective Superintendent Brendan Smith told reporters

'I can't stress it enough, I could use some more colourful language but it wouldn't hit their air, they're just complete idiots.'

He said it was not a gang-related crime and he urged any one filming the brawl, which could have been dozens of people, to give their footage to police.

Det Supt Smith alleged after Mr Harris was killed, the attackers went to a nearby bar and allegedly assaulted the victim's friends. 

Two other men in their group were also arrested but were later released by police without charge.

Police have vowed to come down hard on anyone caught with knives.

'It's that mindset, they honestly think that it's Grand Theft Auto (where) you get a reset button,' Det Supt Smith said.

'Well it doesn't happen; there's two consequences of this: death or jail.

'There's no other outcome, it's not cool.'

The incident was the second alleged stabbing on the Gold Coast in only 24 hours.

A 17-year-old woman was charged by police over the alleged stabbing of a 30-year-old man around Cavill Mall at around 4am on Wednesday morning.

The man had been walking through the area when a fight allegedly broke out among a group of women.
