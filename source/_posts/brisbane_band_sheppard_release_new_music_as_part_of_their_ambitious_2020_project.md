Brisbane-based band Sheppard embarked on an ambitious 'one single per month for an entire year' project in February. 

And despite having 'some close calls' during the creative challenge, singer Amy Sheppard, 29, says they are confident with the progress of their remaining tracks.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Thursday, Amy explained the band's goal was to gradually release their third album to give each single 'its day in the sun'.

Sheppard, formed in 2009, consists of Jason Bovino, and siblings Amy, Emma and George Sheppard.    

'Today, the way in which listeners consume music is so fast-paced and often album tracks can be overlooked. Our goal is to have every song we write this year to have its ''day in the sun.'' An album is a work of art from start to finish and we would love for our fans to really get a chance to hear each track,' she explained.

Amy said some of the year-long project's tracks have been fresh, while others have 'collected dust' from previous unfinished writing sessions over the years.

 'It was so different to anything we’ve ever released... but we're glad we finally finished and released it': Sheppard's August track, Catalina, was previously shelved for three years as the band didn't know if it fit their sound. Pictured on the set of Sheppard's Catalina music video

In fact, she explains that Sheppard's August release, Catalina, was previously shelved for years.   

'It was definitely an experimental track. We sat on this song for three years, because it was so different to anything we’ve ever released before... we are so glad we chose to finally finish and release it,' Amy said.  

Catalina is also the band's first single Amy has sung lead vocals on since her viral Kiss My Fat A** song and campaign in June 2019.   

'As a band, we've always focused on honouring what's right for a particular song. It's fun to be able to surprise fans with a new lead singer from time to time. Catalina is such a fun track, I feel super confident singing it,' she said.

Last year, while her brother George recovered from vocal surgery, Amy flew to Nashville to work on solo material, and says while the band 'will always be [her] priority, [she] would never say never to a side project down the track'.

'We hope fans enjoy it as much as we do': Sheppard released their eighth track this year on Thursday night - a special Somebody Like You duet with Taiwanese pop star SAMMY

Sheppard released their eighth track this year on Thursday night - a special Somebody Like You duet with Taiwanese pop star SAMMY. 

'When Sammy and her team reached out to collaborate on our song, Somebody Like You, we were so excited. She is a massive star in Taiwan and for her to choose our song to collaborate on was a huge compliment. It was beautiful to hear our song being sung in another language by such a talented artist. We hope fans enjoy it as much as we do,' Amy said.

The singer also promised fans that the wait is 'nearly over' for their third album, and to stay tuned on their social media accounts for more exciting news. 

'A world pandemic has definitely squashed a few of our touring/media opportunities, but we’ve tried to collaborate and get out there as much as we possibly can in the current climate.'
