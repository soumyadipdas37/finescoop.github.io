Cult leader Keith Raniere before he was taken into custody. He is awaiting sentencing on sex trafficking charges among other crimes

NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere's lawyers have claimed in court papers that he didn't need to enslave women to have sex because 'many' were already interested in him. 

Raniere is awaiting sentencing on charges including sex trafficking of children, conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. He ran the NXIVM sex cult, enticing a collection of women including some famous actresses and heiresses, who he branded and manipulated. 

He maintains his innocence and said in his court records last week that he stood by everything he has ever done which he thinks includes helping people achieve 'happiness'.

Among the other comments from his lawyers in their 86-page memorandum is that he did not need to recruit women for sex or to manipulate them because he attracted so many other women on his own. 

'Raniere had been in intimate relationships with six of the eight first-line DOS members, many of them for many years. 

'As his personal history to this point made clear, there were many women who took an interest in Raniere in various ways, including wanting to pursue an intimate relationship. 

'He certainly did not need DOS to have sex partners,' they said, using the alternative name for the cult. 

They also claim that it is not true women were branded against their will and that they 'absolutely' knew they were going to be brandished and wanted to be.  

'He remains proud to have played a role in helping people achieve greater happiness and better lives.

NXIVM cult victims were brandished with this symbol. Raniere said those who got it did so of their own volition 

Among the women involved was actress Allison Mack

'He remains proud to have been permitted to play a part in helping citizens and residents of Mexico strive to bring peace to a country beset by violent gangs, kidnappings and murders, a struggle that continues to the present and that will continue into the future. 

'He also remains proud that he and others helped people with Tourette’s syndrome to be able to minimize or eliminate the symptoms of this difficult condition. 

'Simply put, he remains proud of his life’s work.

'He also remains determined to fight this case, which he views as a terrible injustice and, respectfully, an affront to what should be one of the great systems of Justice to ever exist,' his lawyers wrote. 

Raniere's attorneys are asking that he be sentenced to 15 years behind bars. 

Prosecutors want to see him jailed for life and say that it is worrying he has still not shown any remorse for his actions.
