An American expat living in Australia has shared some of the major differences in takeaway food options between the nations - and the seasoning she has fallen in love with Down Under. 

Lara Fourie, 18, moved to Melbourne three years ago from Houston, Texas, settling in Victoria with her family to attend school, and she soon learned that life is very different.

While Lara said she enjoys the adding of 'o' to the end of words - like 'arvo' - and that she feels 'safer' at her high school without the threat of gun violence, she was still shocked to learn that her food options are extremely different in Melbourne.

Lara detailed these things on her popular TikTok account, which has 92,000 followers.

In America you can visit a 'freestyle soda machine' in the restaurants to mix and match the soft drinks you want, with free refills after you purchase your cup (right)

'KFC is in both America and Australia but surprisingly it's way more popular in Australia. But in America they sell mac and cheese there which is really good,' she said.

In Australia Burger King is called Hungry Jacks and they don't have Chick-fil-A, one of Lara's personal favourites when it comes to takeout food.

At McDonald's restaurants the sizes and proportions of both food and drinks is 'way bigger' than in Australia and Americans have both a 'dollar menu' and sweet tea, which is like iced tea.

Whereas in Australia there are more dessert options in the McCafe, Frozen Coke and they sell a burger called the 'chicken and cheese' (left), which Lara enjoys

In general Lara is thoroughly enjoying 'chicken salt' - a seasoning of spices Aussies put on their hot chips - and Kangaroo meat, something she 'never knew existed' before travelling to the southern hemisphere. 

In separate videos Lara outlined some of the things she wished she'd known before landing in the sunburnt country, like that avocados are very expensive and plenty of men enjoy having long locks.  

Magpies are the most dangerous animal

 What's something you wish you knew about Australia before coming to the country?

Now share your opinion

In spring the dreaded male magpie is known for 'swooping' on innocent Australians.

Late August to late October is mating season for the breed and they experience a huge increase in the hormone testosterone that encourages them to protect their young.  

'In Australia we have these hellbound creatures called magpies, and there has always been an ongoing joke that the animals here will attack you but these will literally swoop down from trees and peck at your head,' Lara said in a video.

With the country now entering the spring season, Lara is terrified of coming across them while she lives in the country.

Men have long hair

Australian men prefer to grow their hair to shoulder length, Lara has noticed since moving to Melbourne.

'One thing I first noticed is that a lot of the guys have long hair. In America you don't see that,' the 18-year-old said.

'You very rarely see a guy with hair past his chin but it's very common here.' 

While there are no statistics for how many men choose to grow their hair in Australia, surfers can be known to sport 'man buns'.

There are different phrases used for common things

Lara said that in America an ice block is called a 'popsicle', whereas some Australians refer to them as 'icy poles'.  

'In America we say swimsuits whereas they say cossies, togs or bathers. And we have four square whereas in Australia it's called hand ball,' she said.

Before she moved Lara had never heard or used the word 'bogan' before; something that was embarrassing to note when it came up in conversation.

'The equivalent in America would probably be a redneck,' she said.

Also, in the United States students get into college with a GPA whereas in Australia it's called an ATAR. 

'Everyone in your state is ranked against each other and that's how you get into university,' she said.

Avocados are really expensive

While the food options - like takeaway sushi - were remarkably 'better' Down Under, Lara acknowledged that groceries were extremely expensive.

'Avocados are cheaper in the States, like in Texas they are 60c, whereas in Australia they can be $2 or $3 each,' she said. 

Eating out for most is a 'special treat' because of how much money can be spent on a single outing.

Netball is a sport       

Lara didn't know netball even 'existed' before she moved to Australia. 

'It's a sport they play here in Australia and it's kind of like basketball... although I don't really know the rules,' she said.

While she did say it was made for women, mixed netball teams are extremely popular in the country, particularly as an extra-curricular activity at university.
