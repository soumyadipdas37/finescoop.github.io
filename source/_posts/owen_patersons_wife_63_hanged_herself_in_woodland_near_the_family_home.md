Tory MP Owen Paterson's wife took her own life by hanging after Googling suicide methods three times, a coroner ruled today. 

Aintree racecourse chairman Rose Paterson, 63, was found dead in woodland near her family home in Ellesmere, near Wrexham, in the early hours of June 24. 

Her husband told an inquest by video link in Shrewsbury that when he was shown her body around 6am it was 'evident' she had taken her own life.

He said in a statement after today's verdict: 'The Coroner’s verdict confirming that my wife Rose committed suicide by hanging is absolutely tragic for me, our family and all who knew her.

'We were married for 40 very happy years. Rose will be remembered as a devoted, loving wife, mother and grandmother, as well as a most successful professional in her varied careers in the arts, charity and racing. We are still a long way from beginning to come to terms with her death.'

The inquest previously heard how Mr Paterson reported his wife missing at around 8pm on June 23 after she had not been seen since 10pm the previous night. 

She was found dead in the early hours of June 24 - her husband's birthday.  

Mrs Paterson died by hanging, her inquest heard today 

Mrs Paterson had Googled suicide methods three times, her son Felix told the inquest.  

Pathologist Dr Joanne Stafford confirmed she died from hanging.

Speaking today, Mr Paterson thanked the coroner and West Mercia Police for their 'sensitive' handling on the tragedy. 

He added: 'I am now horribly aware that 18 people commit suicide every day in the UK and I intend to become more involved in suicide-prevention strategies.

'If I can help to prevent just one family going through the extreme anguish that our family is currently suffering, I will have done something really worthwhile.

'I ask everybody to respect our privacy at this desperately sad time.'

The coroner gave a verdict of suicide by hanging.
