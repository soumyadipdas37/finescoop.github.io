Leicester City have made an improved offer of around £36million for St Etienne centre-back Wesley Fofana.

Fofana has been Leicester's prime target throughout the summer but St Etienne have been reluctant to part with the highly-rated 19-year-old. 

As a result Leicester have run a parallel bid for Burnley's James Tarkowski though saw an offer of £30m for him rejected last week.

Leicester are also still interested in Burnley's James Tarkowski, but had a £30m bid rejected

They had indicated they were willing to increase their bid for Tarkowski this week but not before having another go for Fofana, who has already told St Etienne he wishes to join Leicester.

The French side, coached by former Leicester boss Claude Puel, have now asked agents to find a suitable replacement as they consider agreeing to let 6ft 3ins Fofana leave. They have already discussed Bafode Diakite at Toulouse.

Tarkowski has returned to training at Burnley with the Turf Moor club believing their asking price won't be met for the 27-year-old.

Leicester, meanwhile, are in talks with Lyon over the sale of forward Islam Slimani.

The Algerian has 12 months left on contract and Lyon are trying to sign him for free.
