The Black Eyed Peas made their MTV VMAs debut by closing out this year's show with a new single and a blast from the past.

And it was a memorable and electrifying return for will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo, who took to the stage with glowing crotches and newest member J. Rey Soul taking over vocals for Fergie.

The hitmakers came into the night with two nominations of their own: Best Collaboration for their song Ritmo (Bad Boys for Life) featuring J Balvin and Best Latin for the track Mamacita with Ozuna and J. Rey Soul.

They're back! Black Eyed Peas closed out the 2020 MTV VMAs on Sunday with J. Rey Soul taking over vocals for Fergie

Fantastic four: The group seen with Fergie back in November 2010

The group kicked-off the performance with a rendition of Vida Loca off their latest studio album, Translation, with special guests Tyga and a sky-sized projection of Nicky Jam. 

By the time will.i.am kicked into the first verse, all eyes were focused on the group's three leading men and their crotches, that lit up like glow sticks.

Shaking and grinding to the pulsating beat, will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo wore matching white outfits with denim jean jackets.

Lighting things up: will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo kicked-off the performance with glowing crotches during their rendition of the new single, Vida Loca

Causing a stir: Their crotches lit up by the time will.i.am kicked into the first verse

Group effort: Tyga joined the group to drop some lyrics on Vida Loca

J. Rey Soul got into the mix and joined the guys center stage to belt out the chorus, dressed in blue denim Daisy Dukes with a white fishnet shirt over a black bra and white heels. 

'It's mi vida loca (it's mi vida loca) -- So cállate tu boca (yeah, cállate tu boca), the band sang in tandem with J.Rey belting out the higher notes and harmony.

'I already told ya, I told ya, I'm livin' -- La vida loca (la vida loca).'

After trading lead vocals in the closing moments of Vida Loca, the group then transitioned into an encore performance of their massive 2009 hit, I Got A Feeling.

New album: Vida Loca is off the Black Eyed Peas' new studio album, Translation, which dropped June 19

TCoordinated: he three leading men all wore white ensembles with denim jackets

Never one to shy away from making a profound statement, will.i.am finished up the short set with a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who passed away on Friday, by saying: 'Wakanda Forever', which was quickly followed-up with 'Black Lives Matter.'

J. Rey, who gained recognition by appearing in season one of The Voice of the Philippines in 2013, joined the Black Eyed Peas in February 2018. 

She replaced longtime member, Fergie, who had stepped back from the group to devote more time to her son Axl, now seven, whom she shares with ex-husband Josh Duhamel. 

Translation dropped on June 19 and is the band's eighth studio album. It also features the singles No Mañana, Ritmo (Bad Boys for Life) and Mamacita.

Blast from the past: The group also did an encore performance of their massive 2009 hit I Got A Feeling with J. Rey decked out in her Daisy Dukes and fishnet shirt
