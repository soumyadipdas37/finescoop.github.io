The endless, gushing comments on Nadia Bartel's thoughtfully curated Instagram account would have you believe she's the most beautiful and successful woman to have ever walked the face of the earth.

But it turns out the 35-year-old ex-wife of Geelong legend Jimmy Bartel is decidedly less popular on Twitter, where she is routinely trolled by AFL supporters.

Every time a glowing puff piece about Nadia is published in the Melbourne press, footy fans flock to Twitter to ironically call her 'stunning and brave'.

'So stunning. So brave': Nadia Bartel is being brutally trolled by AFL fans for her 'courage' after splitting from husband Jimmy - as Twitter users mock her cheerleaders in the Melbourne press

The 'stunning and brave' tweets are mostly from Victorians making fun of Nadia and her cheerleaders at the Herald Sun newspaper. 

The meme routinely surfaces on Twitter whenever a certain gossip columnist, who is friends with Nadia, writes a flattering article about how brilliant and 'dignified' she is.

Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting Nadia has anything to do with the gushing praise, however, and it's understood the public commentary about her is beyond her control.

'She is brave and soon will have a statue outside the MCG for her bravery. Well deserved for everything she has done for you, me, the nation and the world. Well done Nadia Bartel you are an inspiration to us all,' one troll tweeted.

Mockery: The meme routinely surfaces on Twitter whenever a certain gossip columnist, who is friends with Nadia, writes a flattering article about how brilliant and 'dignified' she is

Similar posts include: 'She is so, so, so brave', 'Stunning and brave, congratulations', 'Brave. And Stunning', and 'Photos of what "brave" Nadia Bartel wore to Juddchella.'

The joke derives from an episode of South Park in which everybody in the town agrees that Caitlyn Jenner is 'stunning and brave' because they're afraid they will be labelled transphobic otherwise.

The phrase has since become a popular meme used when someone is being conspicuously over the top in their praise for another person - with the implication being that the praise isn't deserved.

Excited AFL fans often brace themselves for a deluge of 'stunning and brave' comments whenever the Herald Sun tweets out an article about Nadia.

'Here for the "brave" comments! Not disappointed!' one Twitter user wrote recently. Another added: 'Came for the stunning and brave comments. Laughing.'

The paper published a story on Saturday downplaying Nadia's new relationship with personal trainer Nathan Brodie - and it was soon met with an avalanche of trolling.

One reader tweeted in response: 'Nadia Bartel bravely jogged with a man who sadly isn't a new suitor but just an exercise buddy - sad for her. Braver than I ever imagined So brave and who she runs with so important it's behind a paywall.'
