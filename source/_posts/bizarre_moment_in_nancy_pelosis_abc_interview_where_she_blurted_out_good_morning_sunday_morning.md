Viewers to ABC's Sunday morning political program, This Week, were left confused for a brief moment during an interview in which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to lose her train of thought only to suddenly blurt out a phrase at random. 

Host George Stephanopoulos had asked the speaker about possibility of a second attempt at impeaching Trump in the coming months, but instead of responding to the anchor's question, Pelosi said: 'Good morning, Sunday morning.'

Stephanopoulos initially seemed to smirk during the bizarre response, before his look turned to one of confusion as the interview continued.

The utterance appeared to make no sense whatsoever and soon got people on Twitter wondering what was going on

It didn't take long before Twitter users began talking about the incident online and shared both their concern and amusement over Pelosi's bizarre outburst. 

'This is so uncomfortable to watch....And confusing. It’s like something is malfunctioning,' wrote the daughter of late Senator and former presidential candidate, John McCain, Meghan McCain.

'When you accidentally hit the reset button,' joked another user.

One person on social media urged viewers to watch the clip twice, first watching Pelosi and then during a second viewing specifically watching Stephanopoulos's reaction.

'Watch this once while looking at Pelosi the entire time. Then watch a second time and look at Stephanopoulos's face when she answers,' they suggested.

Others took to Twitter to joke about what they had just witnessed on the Sunday morning show

Another Twitter user believed Pelosi's comments were a weak attempt to change the subject.

'I think she tried to do the 'pivot and change the subject', but she doesn't have the dexterity she did when she was younger. And yet, he got the message. What's MORE telling was his reaction, er... non-reaction like she didn't say anything unusual at all.'

'This clip is like somebody hit the reset button on Pelosi in the middle of an interview,' mused one in a response online.

Others were more understanding and put it down to a 'crossed line' between ABC and another network.

'Seems like a mic issue where someone from another show, probably CBS Sunday Morning, that she was also going to be appearing on was patched into her earpiece and she said "Good morning." Not sure why this is a thing,' tweeted another. 

John Dennis whose Twitter account describes him as a 'Republican Pelosi opponent' attempted to hint at a possible more sinister reason, but then failed to explain.

Some decided to see the funny side of the overall incident which lasted for just a few seconds

John Dennis whose Twitter account describes him as a 'Republican Pelosi opponent' attempted to hint at a possible more sinister reason, but then failed to explain.

'I’ve been a Pelosi opponent for over 10 years. I’ve never seen her behave like this. Would love to speculate, but won’t indulge,' he tweeted.   

'She must be speaking in code to her assistant to have a bottle of vodka ready when the cameras are off,' joked another. 

During the interview, Pelosi refused to rule out pushing forward a privileged impeachment resolution that would have the effect of eating up Senate floor time in the hope of potentially stalling a Supreme Court nomination. 

'We have our options. We have arrows in our quiver that I'm not about to discuss right now but the fact is we have a big challenge in our country,' she told ABC's 'This Week' when asked about the prospect.

'This president has threatened to not even accept the results of the election," Pelosi continued. "Our main goal would be to protect the integrity of the election as we protect the people from the coronavirus." 

Host George Stephanopoulos had asked the speaker about impeaching either Trump or Attorney General Bill Barr as part of a strategy to slow the nomination, with Senate Democrats holding little leverage to act on their own, and President Donald Trump saying he will nominate a successor to Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week following Ginsburg's death Friday.

Pelosi said the vacancy would galvanize supporters, and told Americans: 'You can vote, you can get out the vote.'

She repeated her veiled threat when Stephanopoulos asked her: 'But to be clear, you’re not taking any arrows out of your quiver, you’re not ruling anything out?'

 'We have a responsibility, we take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.

'We have a responsibility to meet the needs of the American people. When we weigh the equities, protecting our democracy requires us to use every arrow in our quiver,' Pelosi said.

Her remarks came just days after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed on Friday to call a vote for whomever Trump nominated as her replacement. 

The next day, protesters gathered outside McConnell's home to demand he stop pushing forward with a new SCOTUS pick.

Fulfilling the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Ginsburg's death before the fall election is as much about McConnell's goal of securing a conservative majority on the court for decades to come as it is about confirming Trump's upcoming nominee.

There's no guarantee the Kentucky Republican will succeed, but he is about to move ahead with a jarring and politically risky strategy to try to bend his majority in the Senate. If it works, he will have ushered three justices to the court in four years, a historic feat. 

She appeared less inclined to hint at her options when asked about another potential Democratic pressure point: threatening to expand the size of the court should they capture the Senate in November and Republicans push through a conservative successor to Ginsburg.

'Well let’s just win the election. Let’s hope that the president will see the light,' Pelosi said.

Pelosi began her remarks stressing the coronavirus and saying Trump planned to use the vacancy to undo the Affordable Care Act – as both parties use the vacancy to try to fire up their supporters.

'She would want us to keep our eye on the ball of the 200,000 people who, probably this weekend would sadly reach that number,' she said of Ginsburg and the growing coronavirus death count. 

'The president is rushing to make some kind of a decision because November 10 is when the oral arguments begin on the Affordable Care Act,’ she said.

‘He doesn’t want to crush the virus, he wants to crush the Affordable Care Act.'

According to a Congressional Research Service report from January 2020 amid Trump's impeachment, after the House transmits an impeachment message and managers, 'The time agreed upon in modern trials has been within a day or two of receipt of the House message.'

'Impeachment Rule III provides that after the articles are presented by the House managers, the Senate will proceed to consider the articles at 1 o’clock the next day (unless the next day is a Sunday), or sooner if ordered by the Senate,' it notes.
