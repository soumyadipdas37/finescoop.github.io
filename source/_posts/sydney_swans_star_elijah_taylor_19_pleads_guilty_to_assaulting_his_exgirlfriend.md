Sydney Swans rookie Elijah Taylor, 19, has plead guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend after she shared photos of her bruised face.

Taylor pleaded guilty to a single charge of aggravated unlawful assault causing bodily harm on Wednesday in Perth Magistrate's Court's family violence court.

He attacked his then-girlfriend Lekahni Pearce on September 13 at a hotel in Perth's CBD.

Taylor, who has since been stood down from the Swans, will be sentenced on December 2.

Ms Pearce had previously claimed on social media that Taylor attacked her. He was arrested in Langford, in Perth's southeast earlier this month.

He was questioned for over five hours in Cannington Police Station before leaving with a blanket covering his face. 

'The Sydney Swans are aware of allegations made on social media regarding first year player Elijah Taylor,' a Sydney Swans statement read.

'The allegations are very serious and are being treated as such.

'The club had notified the AFL and is not in a position to comment further at this time.'

The AFL integrity unit is handling the investigation over the alleged incident.

'The allegations are extremely serious,' an AFL statement reads.

'The AFL has been in contact with local law enforcement and will continue to provide support and assistance for all.'

Taylor's manager Tom Seccull issued a statement saying the club is aware of the allegations.

'However, given the seriousness and sensitivity for those involved, we're not in a position to comment further at this stage,' he said.

The former couple made headlines last month after Taylor snuck Pearce into the Swans' AFL quarantine hub at Perth's Joondalup Resort. 

His senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce in the hotel and raised the alarm, with Taylor suspended for the remainder of the 2020 season.

The 18-year-old had reportedly crossed a golf course to be reunited with her then boyfriend.

Ms Pearce told Channel 7 she didn't see any security guards while sneaking into the hub.  

'I just walked through, went to his room. That's how easy it was. I didn't jump any fences,' she said.  

Ms Pearce had just completed her own mandatory self-quarantine period after flying in from Sydney.

Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal, while his club was fined a total of $50,000 - with $25,000 suspended.

The teenager had been staying with family in WA following the suspension for his breach.

Taylor, who is the nephew of former AFL star turned Channel Seven commentator Brian Taylor, has played four games for the Swans since being drafted from Western Australia.

He made his AFL debut in the Swans' loss again the Gold Coast Suns at the SCG.
