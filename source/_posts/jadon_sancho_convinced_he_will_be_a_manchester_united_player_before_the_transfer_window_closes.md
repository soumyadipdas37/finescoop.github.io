Jadon Sancho is adamant that he will sign for Manchester United before the transfer window closes on October 5.

The 20-year-old winger has called on his advisors to 'pull out all the stops' in order to finalise a deal with the Red Devils.

Borussia Dortmund are also willing to allow Sancho to join United, despite publicly insisting that he would not be leaving the club during the 2020-21 campaign.

Sancho has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but sources close to Dortmund have confirmed that the England winger is working on solidifying terms with the Premier League club.

According to The Sun they said: 'He [Sancho] wants this deal done.

'He's told his agent and various advisors to do all they can to make it happen.

'They are pushing for him.'

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is said to be confident in attaining Sancho's signature, but negotiations are still underway.

The two parties are believed to have held discussions with intermediaries on Tuesday but United are still refusing to meet Dortmund's demand for £108m.

A source close to Dortmund said: 'There's a bit of a stand off going on... it's a case of who blinks first.

'Will United up the offer or will Dortmund accept a lower bid?

'The Red Devils are considering making a final bid for the young star on Wednesday in the hope of forcing the deal across the line.

United could move for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele if they abandon attempts for Sancho

Sancho enjoyed another electric season for the German outfit in 2019-20, scoring 20 goals and providing 18 assists to confirm his name as one of the most talented stars in world football.

United are said to be lining up replacements in case they fail to land him, with Solskjaer desperate to secure a new winger. 

The Red Devils could move for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele if they abandon attempts to sign Sancho. 

United sources confirmed that the 23-year-old Frenchman has been discussed although any move is likely to be on loan.
