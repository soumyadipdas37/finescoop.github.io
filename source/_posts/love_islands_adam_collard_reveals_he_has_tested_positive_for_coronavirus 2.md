Adam Collard has revealed he has tested positive for coronavirus. 

The Love Island star, 24, took to Instagram on Tuesday to tell fans of his diagnosis as well as describing his symptoms, which he said were like a 'bad hangover'.

Adam added he is now in isolation after contracting the virus following a holiday to Greece with his friend. 

Isolation: Adam Collard has revealed he has tested positive for coronavirus

Adam posted on his stories: 'A hell of a lot of people DM'ing me asking what this is like and where it's from etc.

'First point, my best mate and me shared a bed/ flight for 4 days together in Greece and he's tested negative and I'm positive. So it could be from anywhere.

'Done 50+ tests in gym and all negative.

'Secondly, it obviously can be caught by anyone since I'd like to think I'm fitter and healthier than the average joe. No exceptions. 

'Third: How bad is it people keep messaging? 

'For me, it's actually ok, manageable. Best way to describe it is like a bad hangover with a mega dry throat. Annoying more than anything and it comes in waves.

Like other coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold and that triggered SARS, COVID-19 is a respiratory illness.  

Although having a runny nose doesn't rule out coronavirus, it doesn't thus far appear to be a primary symptom. 

Most people only become mildly ill, but the infection can turn serious and even deadly, especially for those who are older or have underlying health conditions.  

In these cases, patients develop pneumonia, which can cause: 

Avoid people with these symptoms. If you develop them, call your health care provider before going to the hospital or doctor, so they and you can prepare to minimize possible exposure if they suspect you have coronavirus. 

'Wanted to do work and a bit of easy training yesterday but today feeling a bit fuzzy in the old head. 

'Hope that answers a few'.     

Adam then shared a video of himself lying on the kitchen floor.

The television personality said: 'So I've laid in bed, I've laid on the sofa. Now I'm lying on the kitchen floor. 

'Just mixing up the environment you know.'

Despite feeling under the weather, Adam shared a string of shirtless snaps as he worked out in his garage.

The Geordie hunk owns his own gym and credited being at his peak of physical fitness to helping him overcome the virus.   

Adam joins the growing list of celebrities who have tested positive for the virus. 

Last month, Denise Van Outen revealed she had contracted Covid-19, with Dynamo, Tom Hanks, Pink and Idris Elba also testing positive. 

Symptoms include a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. 

It comes as Boris Johnson on Tuesday warned there is going to be 'more of this wretched Covid still to come' as he convened his Cabinet and told ministers 'bit by bit' the UK is 'getting back on its feet'.

The Prime Minister told his top team that 'we know there will be more outbreaks' but he is 'absolutely confident' the Government will be able to deal with them.

He also claimed that 'huge numbers' of people are now returning to offices and 'quite right too' amid fears that Professor Chris Whitty could quit over the Government's push to persuade workers to ditch working from home.

The Prime Minister said: 'People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right too. 

'And though of course we know that there is still going to be more of this disease, this wretched Covid still to come, and although we know there will be more outbreaks, we are also absolutely confident that we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks and bit by bit this incredible country is getting back on its feet and recovering from this crisis.'
