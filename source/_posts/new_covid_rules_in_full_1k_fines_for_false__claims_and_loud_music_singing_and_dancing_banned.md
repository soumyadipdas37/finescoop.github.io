Pubs and other venues in England are banned from playing loud music or allowing singing or dancing under sweeping new coronavirus legislation quietly introduced today.

People who refuse to self-isolate can also be fined up to £10,000 if they consistently refuse to stay at home under sweeping new powers put in place by ministers.

And Boris Johnson's administration has also introduced a £1,000 fine for those who  maliciously force people into isolation by falsely telling authorities that they could have come into contact with the virus.

This means that people taking a dark revenge on an ex-partner or a terrible boss by forcing them to stay at home face being hit in the wallet if discovered.

There are also fines for people who try to go into work when they should be in isolation and who fail to tell their employer about their situation. 

But the laws also say you are allowed to break self-isolation, with reasons that are acceptable including taking a pet to the vet. 

The wide-ranging laws and the list of punishments were revealed in legal documents and came into force on Monday.

The wide-ranging laws and the list of punishments were revealed in legal documents and came into force on Monday.

Now, by law, people in England must self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus, or are contacted by the test and trace service, or face fines starting from £1,000, rising to £10,000 for repeat offenders.

Those who test positive must do so for 10 days after displaying symptoms, or from their test date if they are asymptomatic, while members of their household must isolate for 14 days.

Meanwhile it emerged that separate laws, which also came into force on Monday, ban pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes from playing music which exceeds 85 decibels, although live performances are exempt.

The same rules also say that pub landlords or those who run other venues like hotel bars, restaurants and members clubs, must take 'all reasonable measures' to stop singing on the premises by customers in groups of more than six, and dancing.

Wedding ceremonies and receptions are exempt from the rule.

The self-isolation rules show there is a £4,000 first-time fine for those who are 'reckless' by coming into contact with others when they know they should be self-isolating.

For example, going into an office or crowded place when you know this could put people at risk after being told to self-isolate.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We know that the vast majority of people want to do the right thing.

'What we are setting out is that those who recklessly take risks with the health of their friends, families and communities should expect this to be taken seriously.'

Staff also face a £50 fine for failing to tell their employer they have to self-isolate.

The rules also prohibit an employer from allowing staff to attend any place of work, or anywhere connected to their work, while they are having to self-isolate.

Employers must not knowingly allow people to go into work if they know they have to self-isolate.

Police will be carrying out spot checks in 'high incidence areas' and on 'high-risk groups' based on 'local intelligence', the Department of Health and Social Care said.

Those on low incomes who cannot work from home, and have lost income as a result, will also be eligible for a new £500 test and trace support payment, the department added.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman added: 'We have set out details of the new rules on self-isolation just over a week ago now, in order to give people advance notice of what the system would be.

'Obviously we have subsequently been finalising the regulations and making sure that we have got all the steps that we need in place for contact tracing to be effective and to ensure that the self-isolation rules can be properly followed.'
