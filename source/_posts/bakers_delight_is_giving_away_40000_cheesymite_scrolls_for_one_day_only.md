Bakers Delight is set to give away free Cheesymite Scrolls for one day only.

To celebrate its 40th birthday, the iconic bakery chain will hand out 40,000 of its most-loved signature pastries to customers across Australia.

Layered with cheese and Vegemite spread, the scrolls have garnered a cult following over the past four decades with roughly 100million sold to date - that's an average of 30 per hour.

To bag a free pastry, simply head to any Bakers Delight store on Tuesday, September 29 and mention the birthday offer.

And for Victorians living under the strict coronavirus restrictions, scrolls will be gifted to lucky customers as a random 'act of delight' throughout the day. 

The offer is limited to one Cheesymite scroll per person, while stocks last.

Since Roger and Leslie Gillespie opened the first store in Hawthorn, Victoria with their friend Gary Stephenson in 1980, Bakers Delight has woven itself into the fabric of Australian society. 

Now ubiquitous on city streets and in shopping malls nationwide, the bakery started with humble creations including a white block loaf, cheese and bacon rolls and sweet finger buns.

The quintessentially Australian Cheesymite Scroll followed in 1994, when a hungry baker invented it during breakfast in a store kitchen.

By then, the brand had expanded nationally to open stores in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. 

More daring creations followed, with 'BBQ Bonanza Pizzas' and 'Jam Bunlets' appearing on shelves in the early 2000s.

Still owned by the Gillespie family, Bakers Delight is now Australia's most successful bakery franchise with over 700 locations across the country as well as New Zealand, Canada and the US.
