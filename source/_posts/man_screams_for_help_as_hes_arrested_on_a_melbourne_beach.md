A man thrown to the ground and arrested on a packed Melbourne beach yelled for help as onlookers berated police and called coronavirus 'fake'.

The long-haired man was filmed being held on the ground by police at Elwood Beach, between St Kilda and Brighton, on Saturday.

He was one of several arrested at the beach that day, as protesters descended on the area after being kicked out of Brighton.

Witnesses claimed the man was arrested after officers saw him 'sitting on a bench minding his own business' and was not involved in the protest.

Photos show two public order response officers grappling with the man before forcing him to the ground and slapping handcuffs on him.

'I'm within 5km of my house, I've been brutally arrested,' he bellowed to the dozens of onlookers, many of whom were filming the scene.

'I'm more than happy to give you my driver's licence, why the violence?'

As more police began to arrive, he addressed a sergeant directly, claiming: 'I've been brutally attacked by this man here, who doesn't have his name on his badge.

'Everyone here is a witness, I've done nothing wrong, nothing wrong at all.'

The man appeared to have been arrested for not giving police his details, but he insisted he had offered to give them his driver's licence.

He said he had simply asked why he needed to give them that information, and was then thrown to the ground 'by a pile of guys with guns'.

'Is this Australia? You will answer to the lord Jesus for what you're doing,' he yelled.

Onlookers taunted police as 'brainwashed' and 'hope you are proud of yourselves'.

About a dozen officers formed a ring around the arrest, which appeared to be a standard heavy-handed tactic of police arrests that day.

Angry bystanders criticised the huge number of cops for 'one guy who did nothing wrong'.

'Why don't you go get the real crimes? The virus is fake,' one woman shouted.

The man was then marched off in handcuffs shouting 'liberty and freedom is gone'.

As the man was being arrested, a woman could be seen in the background also being handcuffed on the sand by half a dozen cops.

Other photos showed a young woman, who was wearing a mask, being arrested on the sand by two officers - while no less than 15 cops surrounded them.

The photos have outraged Australians who saw the massive police presence as an overreaction aimed to instill compliance through fear.

Melbourne's first step out of lockdown allows people to visit one friend or family member outside of their home for socialising or exercise.

The slight relaxation of lockdown combined with the 26C temperature led stir-crazy Melburnians to flock to the cities few beaches.

But police stalked the sand in large groups, accosting anyone who showed the faintest hint of breaking the rules or being too far from home.

Not far away, there were dozens of arrests as hundreds of protesters took to the streets and parks to oppose the continued lockdown.

In video captured of the event, protesters can be heard yelling 'disgraceful', 'I've done nothing wrong', 'no violence' and 'peaceful' as officers stand nearby.

A man can be seen being arrested as he questions: 'Officers, why are you doing this. I've never done anything wrong in my life.

'Please, this is enough. It's only  going to get worse. Who is going to fight for you.' 

Victoria diagnosed just 14 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, its fewest in months, but Melbourne is still stuck in one of the world's strictest lockdowns.

Premier Daniel Andrews' much-maligned roadmap out of lockdown mandates some form of stay-at-home orders until the state has zero cases.

Meanwhile, NSW has not added any significant restrictions in months since new local cases peaked at about 25 a day, and only recorded one on Sunday.
