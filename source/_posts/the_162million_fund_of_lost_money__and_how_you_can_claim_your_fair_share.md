More than 900,000 people are owed thousands of dollars in a trove of unclaimed cash.

The forgotten $162million is held by the Queensland Public Trustee and is owed to state residents by businesses, agencies, individuals and deceased estates. 

A public trustee spokeswoman said anyone who didn't claim money from a real estate, solicitor or from a loved one who died could be a beneficiary.

'If you've ever changed your name or address, didn't claim money from a real estate, solicitor firm ... there's a chance you may have unclaimed money owing to you, ' she told The Courier Mail.  

The top ten largest sums come from seven deceased estates, a trust fund and an investment group, with the highest figure $419,870.

An estimated 232,000 people are owed more than $100, with about $10million belonging to people who live in Brisbane with postcodes between 4000 and 4029. 

One person is entitled to $213,709 by Brisbane City Council, while another individual is owed $195,682 by Sunshine Coast regional council. 

Queensland Public Trustee receives about $18million in unclaimed cash each year.

The spokeswoman said the trustee paid $4.6million across almost 3,000 claims in the 2019/20 financial year.

'Many people are both surprised and delighted to find there is money owing to them, so we encourage you to search online and check to see if we can reunite you with some long forgotten funds,' the spokeswoman said.

Potential beneficiaries are encouraged go to the Trustee's website and search the database.

'If you find money you think is owing to you, download the claim form and follow the lodgement steps required.'
