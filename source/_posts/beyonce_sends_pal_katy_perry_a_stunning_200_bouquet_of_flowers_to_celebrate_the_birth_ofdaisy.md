Posting to Instagram, the pop star only had on a nude breast pumping harness and a pair of grey high-waisted underwear as she posed in her bathroom mirror, five days after giving birth.    

'Hair and makeup by: @exhaustion,' captioned Perry jokingly, while also tagging the makers of her harness and underwear. 

The Teenage Dream singer's hair was styled into a messy low ponytail as she prepared to pump for her newborn daughter Daisy Dove,

Katy's skin looked enviably clear and the tired singer stood with one arm out to her side as she confidently displayed her post-baby body. 

Perry has a lengthy history and obvious love for the VMAs, being that she hosted the annual award show in 2017.

The Grammy Award nominee shares her first child with fiancé Orlando, 43. Bloom also has a nine-year-old son Flynn with ex Miranda Kerr, 37.

Katy and Orlando, who first started dating in 2016, got engaged on Valentine's Day in 2019. 

Daisies hold a special significance for the couple. Orlando proposed with an ornate daisy engagement ring on Valentine's Day 2019.

In a further hint to the newborn's name ahead of the birth Katy also recently released song Daisies in May with lyrics about the strength of the human spirit as it overcomes adversity

A day after giving birth, Katy celebrated the release of her fifth studio album Smile, which hit shelves and music streaming platforms on Friday.
