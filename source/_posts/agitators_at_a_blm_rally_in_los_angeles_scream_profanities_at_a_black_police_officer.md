A black police officer at a Black Lives Matter rally maintained his composure as demonstrators hurled profanities and taunts at the cop.

Videos circulating around social media shows a group of masked agitators shouting at the officer, who manages to keep a straight face as the abuse is screamed at him.

The demonstrators had taken to the LAPD precinct for their protest, with several seen pulling at the fence used to protect the building.

At various points in the clip, the group can be heard calling the officer a 'b***h,' as they rag on him for being a 'n***a' in the police force. 

One of the people screaming at the officer even mimics shooting a gun with his fingers as they continue shouting at the cop. 

While all of this is happening, the officer continues to look on into the distance.

Protesters march in downtown Los Angeles during a demonstration held to demand justice for the death of Breonna Taylor after the results of a grand jury indictment of former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison 

Protestors took to the street to express their sadness and disappointment over the handling of the Breonna Taylor case. 

On Wednesday, Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron announced that two white Louisville policemen who fired into Taylor's apartment in March will not be prosecuted for her death because their use of force was justified. 

A third officer was charged with wanton endangerment, the lowest-grade felony in Kentucky.
