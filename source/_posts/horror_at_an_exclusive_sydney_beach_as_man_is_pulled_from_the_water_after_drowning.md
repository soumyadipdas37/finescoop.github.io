An elderly man is feared to have drowned after he was pulled unconscious from the water at a popular beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

Emergency crews were called to Redleaf Beach in Double Bay shortly before 1pm following reports a man aged in his 60s was found unconscious in the water.

Five ambulance crews and a rescue chopper were called to the scene to treat the swimmer and commenced CPR.

A NSW Ambulance spokesman told Daily Mail Australia said the man was in a critical condition at the scene and has not yet been transported to hospital.

'It appears the patient has suffered a medical episiode in the water,' the spokesman said.

No other information on the man's condition is currently available. 

More to come.
