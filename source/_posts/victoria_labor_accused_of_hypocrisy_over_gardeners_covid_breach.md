A gardener has been photographed mowing the lawn outside a Labor MP's office in Melbourne - despite Premier Daniel Andrews forbidding similar work across the state due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The photo was snapped outside Labor MP Chris Brayne's office in McCrae, south-east of Melbourne, on Sunday afternoon.

Under current state restrictions, only council gardeners are permitted to work during the pandemic - sole trader gardeners are not allowed to operate.

The person who hired the gardener is unknown after both the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council and Victorian government refuted their involvement.

A government spokesperson confirmed Mr Brayne did not contract the gardener last weekend.

'Neither the Member for Nepean nor the Department of Parliamentary Services is responsible for maintenance outside the electorate office, and neither has contracted any work,' the spokesperson said.    

Edward O'Donohue, the Liberal MP for the Eastern Victoria Region, believes the episode highlights the confusion surrounding measures imposed by the premier.

'The fact that it is even controversial for an independent lawnmower to be cutting the grass in front of a Labor MP's office just further demonstrates the confusion and inconsistency about the Andrews Government's punitive lockdown measures,' he told the Herald Sun.

Jim Penman, the founder of Jim's Mowing, went a step further, stating the photo is an obvious example of 'political hypocrisy.'

'Council workers are doing the same job, and in groups, yet individual franchisees are being prevented from earning a living,' he said.

'This just highlights politics over health and that these things don't matter when it comes to privilege.

'It's outrageous that sole gardeners who have no contact with anyone when doing their jobs are being prevented from working.'

Under Melbourne's controversial lockdown rules, residents caught breaking the chief health officer's guidelines can be slugged with a $1652 fine.

In addition, people leaving their homes for work under Stage Four lockdown restrictions are required to show a permit if they are pulled over by police.
