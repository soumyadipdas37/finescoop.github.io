Emma Stone and her fiance Dave McCary are reportedly now man and wife.

The 21-year-old actress and the 35-year-old Saturday Night Live segment director wed recently, according to a Wednesday report from PageSix.

This comes after the power couple were seen wearing matching wedding bands on their rings fingers earlier this month.

They announced their engagement last December in a sweet social media post, as Stone showed off her stunning diamond and pearl ring.

The duo were set to wed in March but had to postpone the ceremony due to COVID-19.

But in May, Stone had swapped out her engagement ring for a simple gold band, leading to speculation that she and McCary had secretly tied the knot.

The couple's sighting two weeks ago offers even more evidence the pair may have privately exchanged vows, as they were both seen with bands on their ring fingers.

Stone was also seen dressed in baggy overalls, as rumors swirl that the Easy A star is pregnant.
