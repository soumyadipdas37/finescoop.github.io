Business owners have slammed Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for extending the COVID-19 lockdown, claiming the move will completely destroy the retail industry.

Premier Andrews announced the state's strict lockdown would be extended by two weeks, with the earliest possible lessening of restrictions to come on September 13.

But for hospitality and retail businesses the lessening of restrictions do not start until 'step three', which the government is hoping will be reached by October 26.

At this step groups of up to 10 will be able to dine out together, retail stores will re-open and there will be no limits on how many people from each household can do any essential shopping.

But business owners on Chapel Street - one of Melbourne's most famous shopping and retail strips - claim the roadmap out of COVID-19 is too little too late for already struggling business owners.

'Some of our businesses haven't made revenue since the first lockdown,' Chrissie Maus, general manager of Chapel Street, said.

'They have been on borrowed time. It's black and white now, the cure is much worse than the cold. 

'I'm now most concerned about the long term damage to our business owners mental health and our communities well-being.'

Ms Maus said she believes that nursing homes and the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, need to be protected.

'We definitely should be putting an iron-clad protective shield around our elderly and nursing homes, and doing everything we can to protect our health care workers, but we need to sandbag high-risk areas and get everything else open.,' she said.

'Unemployment is soaring and our businesses are living in a sense of hopelessness.

'We are exhausted and need more fiscal support and not this savage plan. Every day we remain shut, the economic recovery compounds and it's snowballing fast now.'

As he outlined his roadmap out of lockdown on Sunday, Mr Andrews said a raft of measures were being considered to help retail and hospitality businesses.

Chrissie Maus, general manager of Chapel Street - one of Melbourne's busiest retail precincts - said the 'cure is worse than the cough'

Mr Andrews promised that plans were in place to help business strips who have suffered under the COVID-19 lockdown (Pictured is a deserted Toorak Road on Sunday)

One of them is to move more diners at cafes and restaurants outside the venue, by adding more tables to the footpath area. 

'We will have more support to businesses, we will have more to say on that soon,' Mr Andrews said.

'We are looking at all about was that we have had some consultations with industry and they would prefer to have everybody back inside. That is not possible in the first instance.

'We may move a significant amount of activity outside the venue (eventually) but it will still be able to happen. And I think we can make that work.'

Chapel Street precinct's chairperson Justin O'Donnell said the experience had been 'painful' for business owners because of its length. 

'This long, slow and painful pathway shows the approach to business lockdowns has been utterly colour blind from Daniel Andrews,' Mr O'Donnell said. 

'We want business open sooner rather than later. It is clear the Victorian government has not had their best interests at heart.'
