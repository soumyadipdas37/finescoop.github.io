Viral video on TikTok shows crowds of tourists packed into a Universal Orlando theme park amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The short clip, which was reportedly filmed at Universal's Island of Adventure, has already been viewed more than 100,000 times since it was uploaded by user  @damarri_eddie on Saturday. 

It's unclear when the footage was recorded, but the hordes of visitors are all seen wearing face masks as they make their way through what appears to be The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. 

The tourists are in direct violation of a guideline put forward by Universal Orlando, which demands that they practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet between their travel party and others'. 

Universal Orlando was forced to shutter back in mid-March, following the coronavirus outbreak. However, the parks partially reopened in early June with strict new safety protocols in place.

A warning posted on the Universal Orlando website states: 'Exposure to COVID-19 is an inherent risk in any public location where people are present, [and] we cannot guarantee you will not be exposed during your visit.'

However, additional information states that theme park officials are 'continuing to work closely with local health officials and their own [contracted] health and safety experts' in order to comply with CDC guidelines'. 

Temperature checks and mask-wearing are both mandatory, and they claim that they are 'limiting capacity and following social distancing guidelines throughout all attractions, restaurants and shops'.

The Universal Orlando website does not state how many visitors are allowed inside each of their theme parks at any given time. 

They also do not disclose how employees will keep tourists from clustering together in certain areas. 

DailyMail.com has reached out for comment.

It comes as Florida reported more than 1,800 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 648,000. 

More than 11,800 Floridians have died from the virus. 

The TikTok footage alarmed many users, who left comments  such as 'I Caught coronavirus just watching this' and 'This is why the pandemic is never gonna go away'. 

However, others argued that people should not remain shuttered inside until a vaccine is available. 

'You wanna live in fear - go hide away in your house and stay there. Let the rest of us live though!' one remarked.
