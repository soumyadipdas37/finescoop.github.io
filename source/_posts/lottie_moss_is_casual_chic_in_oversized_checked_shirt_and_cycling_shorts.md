She's been enjoying some rare extended time in London this year after the pandemic put a stop to her globetrotting.

And Lottie Moss treated herself to a pampering day at her favourite London salon on Tuesday.

The model dressed in head to toe PrettyLittleThing for her outing, looking effortlessly cool in a pink checked oversized shirt.

The blonde showed off her legs by teaming her statement shirt with black cycling shorts.

She added a simple white vest under the shirt and completed her look with pristine white sneakers and a PLT Face Mask for her entry into the salon. 

Lottie spent 3 hours in Blush and Blow in Parsons Green, getting a full on beauty treatment at the plush blow dry and beauty bar on New Kings Road. 

She emerged with flawlessly blow-dried locks, adding her face mask as she headed to her next stop of the day.

Lottie had been isolating in the Cotswolds with her family during the lockdown after being unable to fly home to LA but is now staying in London.  

It's been a rollercoaster time for the model, who shared a couple of pictures of herself crying after watching a 'lame' film last week, as she urged her followers to remember that 'everything isn't always perfect.' 

Enjoying a little 'me-time', the evening seemed to be a pleasant one as she indulged in a relaxing face mask while at home, writing 'self-care' over the snap. 

Then sobbing, she wrote': I shouldn't watch sad films.'

She then cried harder and penned: 'It's OK to not be OK sometimes. It's OK to cry at lame films and it's OK to be a bit lost in life.

'Everyone's lives look so amazing on Instagram and I'm here to remind you that everything isn't always perfect.'

Recently, Lottie fuelled dating speculation when she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during a recent holiday. 

Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April. 

It came after Lottie was linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury.
