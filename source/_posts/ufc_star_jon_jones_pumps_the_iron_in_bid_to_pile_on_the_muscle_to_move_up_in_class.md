UFC star Jon Jones has been putting in the hard yards to make the step up from light heavyweight to heavyweight. 

The 33-year-old explained the reasons behind the decision to vacate the UFC light heavyweight title just last week.

And now he has uploaded a clip from his weights session over the weekend onto social media.

Alongside the gruelling gym workout in a bid to build up muscle, Jones wrote: 'Slowly but surely.'

He had confirmed earlier this month that he was giving up his belt following talks with UFC president Dana White.

Jones, nicknamed 'Bones', has been linked with a match-up against heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic following the call to move up weight class.

Jones said he relinquished his belt as his 'heavyweight goals were going to take some time'

Miocic recently overcame Daniel Cormier while Jones has won 26 out of 28 fights.

On relinquishing the 205lbs crown, Jones wrote on Twitter: 'I vacated the light-heavyweight championship because I knew my heavyweight goals were going to take some time.

'I wasn't going to play games with the contenders and make people fight interim championship belts. There's little rest on the throne.'
