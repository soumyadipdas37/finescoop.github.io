The full list of nominations for this year's Inside Soap awards has been revealed - and there's even a new category.  

Despite being hit by filming restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the UK's soaps have still managed to entertain viewers across the country. 

And now the public have the chance to vote for their favourite show, villain and performance in a range of categories at the awards scheduled for November 16.

Nominations are here! Coronation Street's Geoff Metcalfe, played by Ian Bartholomew, has been included in the best actor and villain categories of this year's Inside Soap Awards

With no fewer than 13 trophies up for grabs the Inside Soap Awards will honour the best performances across all soaps, medical and daytime dramas. 

Chosen by the public, the awards will be determined by fans' votes over the next five weeks, before culminating in a virtual ceremony streamed online.

Another category which will undoubtedly see hot competition is the best show-stopper.

Sinead Osbourne's death in Coronation Street is up against events such as the 35th anniversary river disaster in EastEnders and the tunnel collapse in Hollyoaks. 

Emotional: Back in October fans were left in tears after watching Sinead Osbourne's death in Coronation Street. The moment has been nominated in the best show-stopper category (pictured are Katie McGlynn and Rob Mallard)

Soap fans were left sobbing after Sinead, played by Katie McGlynn, finally lost her battle with cancer in heartbreaking scenes last October.

Corrie aired a special hour-long episode which featured Sinead's final moments with her loved-ones, which left  some viewers struggling to watch the emotional show.

And Coronation Street could also be in for a chance at a gong with Ian Bartholomew being nominated in two categories - best actor and best villain - for his role as Geoff Metcalfe in the show.

Fans were euphoric last Wednesday as Geoff's vile abuse of his wife Yasmeen was finally revealed and his son Tim disowned him.

New category: Shaking things up for this year's virtual ceremony, there will be a new gong for the best feel-good moment. Among the nominations is EastEnders' Walford celebrates Pride

Shelley King, who plays Yasmeen, is also nominated at the virtual awards in the category of best actress. 

'Soaps have been a real source of comfort to people when the rest of the world has seemed strange and scary this year,' said Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap magazine. 

'To have our favourite characters in our living room gave us a sense of normality, so we thought it was vital we recognised the huge role soaps have played in our lives by continuing our popular awards through a virtual ceremony.

Story: Shelley King has been nominated in the best actress category for her performance as Yasmeen Metcalfe. Fans were forced to endure Geoff's horrific abuse of his wife Yasmeen for weeks, before she finally fought back and attacked him with a wine bottle (pictured)

In the running: Ian Bartholomew also features in the best actor category. Viewers were left euphoric on Wednesday when his abuse of his wife Yasmeen was finally revealed

Best newcomer? Clay Milner Russell has been nominated for his role as Bobby Beale, in hit soap EastEnders

'It's also important to remember soaps aren't all shock twists and big explosions of drama,' added Murphy. 

'They're life-affirming, and often remind us that there's always hope, so we wanted to introduce the 'Feel-good moment' accolade to find out what gave the public a rosy glow in these rather uncomfortable times.'

Voting is via the form in the magazine or at the website with the polls opening from midday on Tuesday 15 September.
