She let her lengthy brunette hair rock its natural wave, which created an overall voluminous look for the actress.

Vitolo, whose family runs and owns the famous restaurant Emilio's Ballato in NYC, looked undeniably suave with his perfectly slicked hair and stylish peacoat.

He also had on blue v-neck t-shirt and some dark wash denim jeans, which created a stylish, yet casual silhouette.

Following in Katie's footsteps, Emilio made sure to wear a face mask for their romantic outing.

His mask often slipped off his nose as he spoke to Katie and during one pit stop, Vitolo completely removed his mask from his face. 

He graciously carted Holmes around the city in his bright red Pontiac, even briefly swinging by her Soho apartment.

Katie and Emilio were first linked on Tuesday, September 1, while on an apparent date at Mediterranean restaurant Antique Garage in Soho.

Katie has been uncharacteristically public regarding her budding relationship with Emilio Jr. as she often seen hanging out with him at his father's popular restaurant Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan. 

A source close to the situation recently dished to People that Katie is beyond 'smitten' with her toyboy and that she 'keeps texting him all day long and he loves it.'

The source added: 'He can't get enough of her attention.'

DailyMail.com confirmed exclusively on September 10 that Vitolo broke up with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text message when the photos of him locking lips with Katie went public.

The bombshell break up forced the 24-year-old handbag designer to grapple with the end of an engagement amid COVID-19 and move back to her parents' home. 

It was also uncovered that Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019, and that the actress appears unbothered by the chef's engagement drama.

Katie and Emilio first met when a mutual friend introduced them, and their passions have only intensified since she returned home to New York City following time quarantining with her family in Ohio. 

An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.

The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with the playboy actor, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.

The acting couple were first linked in 2013 hand-in-hand through Malibu, but they kept their relationship private throughout the years, but split after going public last year at the Met Gala.

Holmes was famously married to Tom Cruise, 58, from 2006 until their dramatic divorce in 2012, and they share daughter Suri, 14, born in 2006.
