Former Fox Sports star Neroli Meadows has landed a job with Star Sports India covering the Indian Premier League cricket. 

The 34-year-old will fly to Dubai, where she will stay for the next two months.  

'A little scared to leave the country, but so excited to be back working and especially on such a major tournament,' the presenter told The Sunday Telegraph.

The brunette sports reporter did say she was a little 'nervous' about the new gig.

Neroli previously covered the US Super Bowl in America, as part of her coverage with ESPN Australia in February. 

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Neroli will need to quarantine for a week on the way over and a fortnight when she returns to Australia.

Neroli was let go from Fox Sports back in October after almost a decade with the network. 

The Herald Sun reported it as a cost-cutting drive within the network, where she hosted AFL shows On The Mark and AFL Tonight. 

Meadows took to Twitter to break her silence following the news, offering an honest and dignified response.

She wrote: 'After ten years in two cities, my time at Fox has come to an end. I have had an incredible time with many sensational people. 

'Doing boundary for both AFL and cricket this past year and hosting international cricket has been a dream come true, 20 years in the making.'  

Following the shocking announcement her fellow anchors and media personalities praised the presenter, calling her 'best in the business'. 

Fellow sports reporter Erin Molan tweeted offered her support. 

'She is an absolute gun. One of the best in the business. I have no doubt she will be picked up ASAP,' she wrote.
