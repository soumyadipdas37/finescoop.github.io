Ant McPartlin looked in good spirits as he was seen the day before ex-wife Lisa Armstrong left his belongings out on the street. 

The Britain's Got Talent host, 44, didn't seem at all put out by the gesture as he joined girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett, 43 for a dog walk in London on Saturday.

Laughing and joking with his other half, it appeared his acrimonious relationship with his ex-wife was the furthest thing from his mind. 

Who had the last laugh? Ant McPartlin looked in good spirits as he was seen the day before ex-wife Lisa Armstrong left his belongings out on the street

Ant was seen striding past with his dog Hurley - who splits time between the star and Lisa after a lengthy custody battle took place amid their divorce settlement. 

Throwing his head back and laughing, the presenter seemed to be having the time of his life as he chatted with Anne-Marie, who was walking their two Maltipoo puppies. 

Anne-Marie - who met Ant whilst working as his personal assistant - looked effortlessly stylish for the stroll as she teamed a pink ditsy print skirt with a black jumper.

Charitable: A day after Ant was spotted on his dog walk, Lisa said a final goodbye to her ex-husband as she left out his unwanted possessions in the street for her neighbours to take

A day after Ant was spotted on his dog walk, Lisa said a final goodbye to her ex-husband as she left out his unwanted possessions in the street for her neighbours to take.

No doubt the items were no longer wanted by the TV presenter so Lisa made sure they went to a good home instead.

The make-up artist, 43, placed the goods in boxes marked 'help yourself' and put them outside her west London property as she prepares to move out of the marital home she formerly shared with her ex.

The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway.

There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games.

No longer needed was Piers Morgan’s book The Insider and Lisa threw in her own Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales from the Dance Floor - she is Strictly's head make-up artist

Lisa, who received £31 million in her divorce settlement from Ant, was also throwing out a bowl used by labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book.

A source told The Sun that Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.'

They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks.

'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.”

Another source said: 'Some of it is Ant’s, some of it is Lisa’s and some of it they bought together.' 

On Tuesday, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.

He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book.

Piers told co-host Susanna Reid and the audience: 'Ant McPartlin’s ex Lisa Armstrong – who is a wonderful makeup artist, she does my makeup on Life Stories.

Still going strong: The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie

Tense: Anne-Marie and Ant's relationship came under scrutiny when they first stated dating as Lisa accused the PA of 'breaking the girl code' by dating him and not telling her 

'And I thought we were friends. I really did. I was quite friendly with Ant. Apparently this is stuff that Ant himself didn’t want back.

'These are the unwanted items that neither of them ever wanted to see again. There were things you’d expect, like Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales From the Dancefloor. Wholly understandable.

'His Newcastle shirt. I wouldn’t want to keep them either. A Team Ant foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. Again, why would you want that?

'So you have all these things – and in the middle of it, you have a copy of my book, The Insider.'

New woman: During his divorce hearing, Ant had to technically admit adultery with Anne-Marie as their relationship officially began while he and Lisa were still married

Wedding bells? As Ant's divorce was finalised in April 2020, he is now free to marry Anne-Marie if he wishes to

Later on in the show, Piers said Lisa had contacted him to apologise.

She told him: '"Oh my god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t even there. I haven’t even see that book. Are you mad at me?"’ Yes – I am mad at you. No, I just want my book back!' 

Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green.

Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.

A source previously told The Sun: 'Ant's been desperate to start the next chapter of his life and at least now he and Anne-Marie can plan for the future. It won't be long before they're married'

Cosy: The couple seemed in good spirits as they headed out on their daily dog walk 

The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie.

However last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news. 

Meanwhile, Lisa has named her new cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant.
