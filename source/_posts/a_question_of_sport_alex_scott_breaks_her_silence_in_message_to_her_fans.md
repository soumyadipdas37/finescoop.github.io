Alex Scott broke her silence on Instagram on Friday to thank her fans after Gary Lineker prematurely congratulated her on her A Question Of Sport hosting role. 

She wrote: 'The love & support shown to me yesterday has me smiling through the weekend #thankyou I am going to #keeponkeepingon like always!

'The only thing that is signed sealed delivered that I am buzzing about right now though is....@Aubameyang7 @Arsenal #COYG.' 

'Thanks for the love and support': Alex Scott thanked fans on Instagram on Friday after Gary Lineker prematurely congratulated her on getting the A Question Of Sport hosting role

Keeping fit: She went for a run in the sunshine that day after receiving both supportive and abusive messages on Twitter following rumours she will take over from Sue Barker

Her words came after BBC pundit Gary, 59, was accused of race-baiting when he tweeted a rumour as fact and urged people not to have a problem with the appointment.

He wrote on Thursday: 'Congratulations and good luck to @AlexScott on being the new host for Question Of Sport. 

'Smart, knowledgeable and perfectly qualified for the role. Oh... and if you have a problem with Alex getting the job, you might just be part of the problem.' 

'Thank you': Alex shared a sweet message following the rumours of her possible appointment on the much love sporting show 

Afterwards, lots of people tweeted their support towards Alex, who is of Irish and Jamaican descent, getting the job, but others sent vile abuse. 

One wrote: 'Wow, I see you got the job Sue Barker has done so well for so many years. It's obviously because of your presenting skills. Nothing else. Nothing PC. Nothing about having token black people on the BBC. You must be very proud.'

Another wrote: 'She will fail...black and no charm.'

Changes: Sue, 64, has been axed from the BBC show, alongside team captains Matt Dawson (left) and Phil Tufnell (right) and Alex has been widely tipped to replace her



Congratulations and good luck: Gary was accused of 'race-baiting' after he prematurely confirmed the news on Twitter and called out anyone who had a problem with the decision 

A third added: 'What's the obsession with her she's absolute dug meat...just because she's a black woman #positivediscrimination'

The BBC was forced to deny claims she had got the role as 64-year-old Sue Barker's replacement, saying that nothing had been decided just yet.  

A BBC Spokesperson told MailOnline: 'This is all speculation, and no conversations have been made about the future line-up.'

Sweaty: While on her run, Alex whipped off her top to show her sports bra and leggings

Fit: She was giving it her all on her fast-paced sprint in a north London park 

No diva: She kept a low profile as she put herself through her paces 

Lovely: Alex was deep in concentration when she ran with her phone in hand and has been keeping positive despite the furore surrounding her possible new job

Ex England defender and former Strictly contestant Alex, 35, has been rumoured to become 64-year-old Sue's replacement after she was axed as host after 24 years, alongside team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell. 

Gary's latest post comes days after he appeared to shrug off the new BBC director-general's warning to staff to cut out political tweeting as it is revealed he will not be bound by the new impartiality rules.

The outspoken Match of the Day presenter suggested he was relaxed by Tim Davie's anti-bias drive, which called upon staff to rein in their social media.

He replied 'nah' in response to suggestions he should be 'terrified' of the clampdown.







Racism: While lots of people have been supportive about the thought of Alex hosting AQOS, others have sent vile abuse  

As a freelance presenter Lineker has space to voice his opinions and has not been hamstrung by the BBC's code of impartiality which restricts full-time employees. 

A BBC spokesman said: '[Lineker] is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and, as such, any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality.'  

The Match Of The Day host has signed a new five-year contract with the broadcaster, with a 23% pay cut – from £1.75 million to around £1.35 million. 

The wording of Gary's tweet about her appointment also seemed to ire the masses when he was accused of 'race-baiting people for an argument'.

They wrote: 'Lineker is real race baiter - seems he loves to stir things - I like Alex Scott - but Lineker should just get on with his other job as housing Officer ( to anyone but British) #DefundTheBBC.'

'What a smug, arrogant man you are! What was the point of that last comment? no need! You’re just baiting people for an argument.

'If she’s the right person for the job then good for her, no need to bring colour into it. You're part of the problem!' 

'Your last comment of your tweet is part of the problem stop starting a stupid debate!!'   











Tone deaf: Gary was accused of 'baiting people for an argument' with his latest post 

Meanwhile, a source claimed that rumours Alex would be given the new job had 'nothing to do with gender, nor is it a case of the BBC trying to be woke'. 

An insider told The Sun that Alex was 'lined up' as Sue's replacement because she has lots of sporting knowledge and experience.

They said: 'Like Sue, she's a former sportswoman and she also has five years of broadcasting under her belt. 

Confirmed: Alex's star has risen all the more since she competed on Strictly in 2019

'This has nothing to do with gender, nor is it a case of the BBC trying to be woke. 

The source also explained how Alex had impressed BBC bosses when she appeared on the show in the past. 

The BBC has failed to reach its 2020 target for Black, Asian and minority ethic (BAME) leaders, they admitted on Tuesday.

In a briefing to outline their annual report, new director-general Tim Davie told journalists that the organisation needs to 'do better on diversity'.

The BBC launched a report in 2018, which committed to a 15% BAME leadership target by 2020. 

They pledged to appoint at least two BAME members on every senior leadership group by the end of 2020.   





Celebrity reactions: TV star Richard Osman and Piers Morgan also waded into the debate about Alex's rumoured appointment following Gary's tweet 

Alex has guest-starred on A Question Of Sport twice, with one occasion being aired in November 2016.

During the episode she appeared alongside Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell, England cricketer Mark Wood and Scottish rugby star Stuart Hogg. 

During her athletic career, Alex has represented Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics and was awarded an MBE in 2016 as well as scoring 12 goals for England. 

After retiring from football in 2017 she went on to be the first female pundit on Sky Sport's Super Sunday show. 

Alex has plenty of presenting experience as she has also co-presented CBBC's Match of the Day Kickabout and BBC One's The Women's Football Show. 

On screen: Alex previously appeared on A Question Of Sport in 2016 alongside Scottish rugby star Stuart Hogg (pictured during the show)

Last year, she appeared on Strictly Come Dancing and was partnered with professional dancer Neil Jones.   

It comes after Sue, who will stay on as the corporation's face of Wimbledon, told of her sadness at having to leave the show after 24 years.

She said that the BBC had to remove her from A Question Of Sport as she would never have left her dream job voluntarily. 

She told Sportsmail on Sunday: 'I love the show so much they would have to remove me, it would have been tough for me to walk away.

'I've absolutely loved my 24 years fronting A Question Of Sport, it's been my dream job,' she said.

'But I understand the BBC want to take the show in a new direction and I'm sad to say goodbye.'

Career: Alex has previously played for England and Arsenal before becoming a successful TV presenter (pictured in 2017) 

Family: Alex, pictured with her mother, Carol in March 2019, is of Irish and Jamaican descent 

Barker will continue with presenting duties for the next two summers at Wimbledon, having signed a three-year deal last year. 

Sportsmail understands she signed a new three-year contract last year to carry her through until at least 2022, something that will come as a relief to many viewers. 

Sue, Matt and Phil are yet to comment on Alex's new role. MailOnline has contacted their representatives for comment.  

The decision to axe Miss Barker sparked fury from critics who accused the BBC of ageism, including former BBC radio and TV presenter Wendy Austin who tweeted: 'No ageism/sexism in the BBC then... 











Something to say: Shortly after Gary's tweet, fans took to Twitter in their droves to express their views, which were a mixed bag

Ex-newsreader Jennie Bond told GMB: 'Sue will be hurting this morning. You can't do anything about your age and there is a pressure on television, particularly for women, to look younger.' 

On Monday, sources disclosed to Sportsmail that Alex is well-liked by the broadcaster and in the mix to replace Barker as presenter. 

Ex-Tottenham and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas was also said to be in the running to become one of the new team captains, with the BBC keen to diversify. 

Shortly after the announcement, fans took to Twitter to express their views. 

They wrote: 'A tired old show - which has had multiple team captains and previous presenters - deciding to freshening things up is hardly earth shattering.' 

'I hope the ratings plummet! , which they will as hoards switch off the BBC. this is purely a decision taken to appease the racial slant. Sue Barker will always be the face of QoS.' 

'All the very best to Alex Scott. Always need to liven things up a bit. Alex always comes across very well.' 

'At times people are thrust into a position as a token gesture. But in the case of Alex Scott it's thoroughly warrented. She's one of the best right now.' 

End of an era: It was revealed this week that Sue had been  axed as host of the show after 24 years. She will still be continue with presenting duties for the next two summers at Wimbledon

By Amie Gordon for MailOnline 

She unlaced her football boots and swapped the pitch for the ballroom, and now Alex Scott could add another string to her bow as rumours abound that she is to take the helm at a Question of Sport.

After days of fevered speculation, the 35-year-old England player-turned-pundit has been tipped as Sue Barker's successor on the long-running BBC sports show.

Former Strictly contestant Scott, who once revealed she faced threats of rape and acid attacks, could take over next year after Barker, 64, was axed after 24 years, alongside team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell.

From the pitch to the ballroom: Alex played for England and Arsenal before becoming a successful TV presenter (left in 2017). Right, on Strictly last year 

The move would be Scott's biggest presenting gig to date, having forged a successful career as a pundit on Sky Sports and the BBC.

The former Arsenal right-back, who was brought up on a council estate in Poplar, east London by her single mother, was taken on by the London club aged just eight.

She worked in the Arsenal laundry room as a teenager to make extra cash, before going on to Captain the women's team and lead them to FA Cup victory.

Alex and Neil were eliminated on week 11 of Strictly, and the footballer's stint on the show saw her dance alongside Kevin Clifton for two weeks after her dance partner had to pull out temporarily because of an injury

She said it 'blows my mind' when young girls hail her as an inspiration.

Speaking last year, she said she didn't have any female footballers to look up to when she was a child, and instead idolised her mother Carol McKee and Arsenal legend Ian Wright.

Scott founded an academy for young female footballers, finished her career as the second most capped England player with 140 appearances and was awarded an MBE in 2017.

But it hasn't all been plain sailing. After covering the men's World Cup in Russia for the BBC in 2018, Scott has been dogged by abuse online and turned to alcohol and underwent therapy in a bid to cope with the trolling.

But the retired Lioness will defy the critics if she takes up the post next year.

In an interview with the Guardian in 2018, Scott, who was born to parents of Jamaican and Irish descent, detailed the abuse she was subjected to.

She said: 'The comments were like: 'I know where you live. I'm going to come and throw acid in your face. I'm going to rape you.''

While she says she's learned to ignore the comments, she says seeing how 'it upsets my mum is hard.'

In 2008, Scott moved to US side Boston Breakers for two years before returning to Arsenal, leading her team to an FA Cup victory as Captain.

In 2011 she founded the Alex Scott Academy for female footballers aged 16-19.

She played her last game in 2018, and finished her career as the second most capped England player with 140 appearances, playing in three World Cups.

Touching on the growing popularity in women's football, she told The Sun on Sunday, 'I love the fact girls have more visibility now. Not just across sport, in all industries.'

Speaking to Hello! magazine alongside her Strictly partner last year, Alex told the magazine she was single and happy as she denied rumours she and her partner Neil Jones had struck up a romance.

She added: 'I'm single but it's not like I need to find someone. I like things to happen organically and if someone comes into my life and we get on, then great. It's not like I need to go searching for it.'

She said she and Neil shared a 'connection' but Scott confirmed she, 'came out of a long-term relationship' just before she went on Strictly.

The duo were eliminated on week 11 of Strictly.

Scott captioned this snap: 'Yes I did work in the Arsenal laundry aged 16/17 to earn some extra cash, and I got to have a photo with my fave [Ian Wright..But I still pinch myself as I fast forward to the now..I managed to go on to captain Arsenal and make a career for myself along the way. #dreambig' [sic]

After rising to the top of her game in football, Scott went on to become the first female pundit for men's Premier League games on Sky Sports.

In 2018, she travelled to Russia alongside Rio Ferdinand to meet Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin.

The pair and a host of other 'world football legends' – including Peter Schmeichel and Lothar Matthaus - enjoyed tea and cake with the Russian president before gifting him a football shirt emblazoned with his name.

Speaking in 2019, she made clear her ambition to appear on prime time TV when she said she would more than happily 'put my name in the hat' should Gary Lineker decide he's 'had enough' of fronting Match of the Day.

But Scott said her presence on screen in a traditionally male-dominated profession triggered horrendous abuse which began while she was still playing.

The star was close to her late grandmother, who she 'listened to for hours about her childhood in Jamaica'

In conversation with Watford captain Troy Deeney as part of the Heads Up campaign focusing on mental health, the star revealed the extent to which the online 'trolling' affected her.

'When I retired, getting trolled, I found that I was turning to drink to try and hide everything, hide what I was feeling,' she said.

'I didn't tell anyone, I didn't tell my mum because I didn't want her to worry or put that stress on her. I was just that person (who thought) 'I can look after myself, I can deal with stuff' but obviously sometimes that's the wrong way.

'I got to a dark place and it was over Christmas, that's when I was like 'I can't carry on like this, it's not me, I need to seek help' and that led me into therapy.

'I want to take that stigma away from it. Now when I talk about mental health, straight away I'm smiling because I know what it's done for me to leave that place. I'm content.

'I'm happy, and I've used the tools that I've learned to be in that place.'

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror last year, she said: 'I had all of it — for being a woman on TV, for being a woman of ­colour on TV, that I'm ticking a box, death threats.

'I had the lot. But I'm still standing. All the time I thought, 'No, I'm good at my job'. That's why I did my degree, so no one can ever say I'm just there because I'm a tick in a box.'

Speaking after her stint on Strictly, Scott revealed she was undergoing therapy to cope with the abuse, telling the Sun: 'I would say I'm still on a journey. I'm still in therapy so I'm still learning how to communicate with my emotions more.'
