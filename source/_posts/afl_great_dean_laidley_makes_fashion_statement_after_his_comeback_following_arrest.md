Former AFL premiership player and coach Dean Laidley made a bold fashion statement in a court appearance on Tuesday.

The 53-year-old appeared via video link at a hearing at Melbourne Magistrates Court, having completed a program at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility.

At Tuesday's appearance, Laidley donned long, bright orange acrylic fingernails and sipped from a mug bearing the words 'Don't Worry Be Happy', the Herald Sun reported. 

At the time of his arrest on May 2, Laidley was illicitly photographed in custody while wearing a dress, with a long blonde wig and makeup.

Laidley is accused of trying to contact an estranged girlfriend more than 100 times in calls and texts between April 4 and May 2.

The former North Melbourne coach's lawyer said Laidley had completed his treatment program at the clinic, and would continue treatment as an outpatient. 

Laidley, who began his AFL playing career with West Coast and was part of North Melbourne's 1996 premiership team, was charged with a series of offences in May including stalking and committing an indictable offence while on bail.

Police allege they found 0.43 grams of methamphetamine hidden in his bra. 

He was on police bail at the time after being charged on summons with ice possession. 

The former West Coast Eagles star was also charged with a persistent breach of a family violence order, using a carriage service to menace and four other intervention order breaches.     

Laidley spent over a month in a Geelong rehabilitation clinic after his arrest and was then moved to a transitional housing facility.

Victoria's corruption watchdog, the independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, launched an investigation into the leaking of the photos.      

Police Commissioner Shane Patton warned the leak was 'unacceptable'. 

'I am appalled an employee of Victoria Police has taken these photographs.

'It is appalling conduct and there is no place for it in our ­organisation,' he said.  

Around 100 police employees have reportedly come forward about receiving the photos and the officers in question could face dismissal and criminal charges.

Laidley will return to court to face the charges on Dec. 14. 

Laidley grew up in Balga in Perth's north and played senior football for the West Perth Football Club.

He made his debut for the West Coast Eagles in 1987, where he played 52 games before being traded to the North Melbourne ahead of the 1993 season.  

He won a premiership with the Kangaroos in 1996 and was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame in 2019. 

His willingness to commit to contested balls earned him the nickname of 'The Junkyard Dog'.

His coaching career includes seven seasons with the Kangaroos between 2003 and 2009.

Laidley also spent time with Port Adelaide, St Kilda and Carlton.  

He and his family were attacked by bouncers at the Bounty night club in Bali after his daughter's wedding in 2011.

His son received a broken jaw while Laidley required stitches after being hit in the head with a bottle. 

Laidley began coaching Maribyrnong Park in the Essendon Districts Football League in 2019.
