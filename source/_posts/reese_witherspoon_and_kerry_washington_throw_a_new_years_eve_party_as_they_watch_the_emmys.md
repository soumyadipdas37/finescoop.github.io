While there was no one in attendance at the Emmys on Sunday night, several of the nominees watched the telecast together, including Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washignton.

Witherspoon, 44, and Washington, 43, who both starred in and executive produced the hit Hulu series Little Fires Everywhere, watched the show together at their own little party on Sunday night.

Host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged that the co-stars were watching the show together, when they admitted that they were actually holding a New Year's Eve party early.

Party: While there was no one in attendance at the Emmys on Sunday night, several of the nominees watched the telecast together, including Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washignton

Kimmel noticed that they were all wearing Happy New Year hats and novelty glasses, and asked why they were wearing those. 

'Oh, we're having a New Year's Eve party,' Washington admitted, and when Kimmel asked why they were doing that.

'Well, because we're ready for this year to be over,' Witherspoon said, while raising a glass of champagne.

When Kimmel asked if they can just do that, just end the year like that, Witherspoon offered why they could.

'Well yeah, we're Emmy-nominated television producers,' Witherspoon added, referring to their nomination for Little Fires Everywhere. 

Washington then proceeded to count down to the 'new year,' 'though Kimmel said it wasn't midnight, though Witherspoon countered,'nobody knows what day it is.'

Year end: When Kimmel asked if they can just do that, just end the year like that, Witherspoon offered why they could

When they counted down to zero they all wished each other a Happy New Year... in mid-September.

While they celebrated, both Witherspoon and Washington wished they could 'kiss each other' right now, as they stayed socially distant at different tables.

Kimmel joked that he wished he could kiss them too, Washington said immediately, 'No we don't want that, thank you' as Witherspoon cracked up laughing.

Witherspoon also took to Instagram on Sunday, to reveal that she hosted the Emmys/New Year's party at her home, with a snap of her in her little black dress.

'Shortest #Emmys commute yet! Bringing the festivities to my lawn and excited to celebrate the incredible cast and crews of @themorningshow @biglittlelies and @littlefireshulu tonight!' Witherspoon said, while tagging her production company Hello Sunshine and the Television Academy.

She also shared some behind-the-scenes snaps of her Emmy prep, revealing her dress was by Louis Vuitton.

This year's Emmys ceremony was quite unique, with only a handful of presenters actually present at Staples Center with host Jimmy Kimmel.

It was previously reported that people in full hazmat suits will be going to the homes of the winners to deliver their Emmy awards in person while they deliver their speech live through video conferencing.

The telecast was also unique in that some of the presenters were everyday Americans and essential workers who have been on the front lines since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
