Barcelona have made an £18million bid for Ajax full back Sergino Dest which could end Max Aarons' hopes of a dream move to the Nou Camp.

The LaLiga side looked to be losing the race for Dest to Bayern Munich but have made a fresh approach, after their attempts to sign Aarons on loan were rejected by Norwich last week.

The Canaries are holding out for a £20m bid for their star right back and were not prepared to entertain Barca's offer of a loan without an obligation to buy

If the offer for Dest is accepted it would end Max Aarons' hopes of a dream move to the club

Spanish outlet SPORT claimed the Catalans were preparing to make a fresh offer for Aarons after agreeing a five-year contract with the defender but Ronaldo Koeman has turned his attentions back to Dest. 

The American international is also wanted by Bayern after impressing in the Eredivisie last season.

The 19-year-old made five assists in 20 appearances and looks to have a bright future.

Aarons is still a player Koeman likes after watching him in action against Everton last season.  

The 20-year-old played in all 36 Premier League games for Norwich last season and covered more distance than Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold.

His passing accuracy in the final third was one of the highest among the league's full backs despite his side finishing the season bottom of the table.

The defender has played in both of Norwich's Championship fixtures this season which have included a draw against Preston and a victory over Huddersfield.

Aarons has also been linked with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen but it is understood his preference is to complete a move to the Nou Camp.
