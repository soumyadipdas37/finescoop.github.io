1. WE’RE ONE BIG FAMIGLIA 

We love our family kitchen – it’s not at all smart, but it’s big. Anne-Marie is Italian and her parents Massimo and Rina, who have been in the UK for 30-odd years, live with us. We have every meal together and really enjoy each other’s company.

This picture of us all was taken on holiday in Italy. Also there are my grown-up children, Tom, 26, who works in finance and Libby, 23, who runs my weight-loss and fitness website, inspired by my losing four stone – as a resolute foodie I’m really proud of that.

2. CHILLED OUT!

This is my Union Jack drinks fridge, which belongs only to me. It has only my drinks in it – diet fizzy drinks, beer and white wine. It used to be the only fridge I had when we had a little house. Now we’ve moved somewhere bigger, we’ve got a bigger fridge to go with it. But this one’s still dear to me, I had it before I met my wife, and I want to keep it. The freezer section is only for ice cubes, by the way!

3. OLD ROMANTIC

This plate reminds me of wonderful visits to Portofino, northern Italy. Anne-Marie and I had been dating for about three months when we first went, and we went back on our honeymoon in 2018. 

It’s tiny, but beautiful and expensive. I proposed in London though – I managed to book a floor of an office block with a balcony overlooking St Paul’s. I had a musician and a private chef waiting for us there.

4. LIKE FATHER... 

I was hoping our boy Sid, who’s one, would inherit the characteristics of his mum’s side, but although he is very fortunate to have their looks, he is certainly a Wallace. He’s loud, gets angry, wants constant attention, and loves his food. He’ll finish his dinner and then sit with me or his grandpa – the only ones who indulge his greed – and have a go at our food. He looks like a little rugby player to me, which is fine as I’m a huge rugby fan. 

5. FROM HUMBLE ROOTS

My friend, the chef Monica Galetti, gave me this knife. I’ve worked with her on MasterChef: The Professionals for over ten years now. Having left school at 14, I’m grateful for the way my career has gone. My mother was a computer operator when computers were the size of a room and my father was an electrician, and I had a happy childhood in Peckham until they broke up. 

Then I left school, got a job in a dry-cleaners and lived in the flat upstairs, surviving on fish and chips and kebabs. Getting a job selling fruit and veg in Covent Garden saved the day. I had my own business at 24, then TV beckoned.

6. MY TWO BEST FRIENDS

We have two rescue French bulldogs from the Dogs Trust: Bella (in the basket) and Wally. Every morning when Sid comes down to the kitchen he gets into the dog basket and plays with them. They are just beautiful, happy members of the family who have always been so good with him since he was a baby. When he was very little we’d put him down on a rug to roll about on the floor and they’d come and sit either side of the rug and guard him. If he cried in another room, Wally would run in to let us know.
