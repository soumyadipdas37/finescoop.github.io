She has turned her stripes as a world famous fashion model.

And Arizona Muse used the red carpet as her runway on Saturday evening, as she arrived at the Marx premiere during the 77th Venice Film Festival.

The British-American star, 31, looked breathtaking in a stunning red gown, which boasted a deeply plunging neckline complete with ruffled detailing.

Lady in red! Arizona Muse used the red carpet as her runway on Saturday evening, as she arrived at the Marx premiere during the 77th Venice Film Festival

Arizona's gown was cinched around her svelte waist and featured a full skirt which cascaded down to the carpet, as she strutted her way into the event.

The Vogue Cover girl added sparkle to her look with a dazzling diamond necklace and a pair of simple hoop earrings.

She let her natural beauty shine through as she sported a natural pallet of make-up, while wearing her highlighted locks in a loose bouncy style.

Arizona welcomed her first child Nikko, 10, with fashion stylist and former flame Manuel Quintana when she was 20.

Speaking to Town and Country magazine, the beauty reflected on being a young parent.

She said: 'I don’t know what it’s like to be a 20-year-old who didn’t have a child. I loved having Nikko.

'He was like a doll. I was a child myself and it was an "ignorance is bliss" situation.'

Arizona candidly admitted her reasoning for marriage being particularly meaningful to her, given that Nikko 'doesn't have a relationship' with her ex-fiancé Manuel.

She said: 'It meant a lot to me to get married. Especially because I already had a child who doesn’t have a relationship with his dad.'

Touching on how she burnt herself out by working and parenting in the early days, she told: 'By the time Nikko was three, I was totally exhausted.'

Arizona battled on because she feared that if she took time off her career would disappear - which caused her massive amounts of stress that she 'was under, every single day, for years'.

She added: 'I probably needed to take some time off, but I was stuck in this fear cycle.

Arizona announced the arrival of her baby daughter by sharing an adorable snap of her laying alongside the newborn in November 2018.
