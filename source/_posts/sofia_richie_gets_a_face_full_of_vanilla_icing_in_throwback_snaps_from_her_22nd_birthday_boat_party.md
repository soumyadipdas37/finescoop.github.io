Sofia Richie is already reminiscing about her 22nd birthday soiree which as just last month.

The young model looked like she had a blast during her b-day boat ride in some new snaps from the celebration which were shared to Instagram on Monday.

Despite the fact that smart phones can take high quality photos, the beauty embraced a retro technique and actually used a camera with film.

'@amberasaly came back with the film so brace yourself for more pics,' the beauty captioned her most recent Instagram post. 

Sofia shared three new shots from her August girl's trip to Cabo San Lucas for her birthday. 

The first snap sees the model and her equally photogenic gal pals lounging in a cluster on the back of a boat.

The six bikini clad beauties struck a pose for the camera while soaking up some sun and sipping glasses of rose.

Too cute! In one snap, Sofia smiled broadly with her face covered in vanilla frosting from her birthday cake

Sofia stunned in a green checkered bikini that highlighted her petite frame.

In the next image, Sofia was presented with a small iced birthday cake topped with pink French macarons. 

Her name was written in pink on the side of the confection but, likely due to the August heat, it was a little worse for the wear with the 'S' sliding off.

The final photo sees the daughter of Lionel Richie with a face full of vanilla icing and a huge ear-to-ear grin.

Looking good: In previous snaps from the day, Sofia flaunted her curves in the skimpy bikini, showing off a pair of high-rise bottoms that hugged her tiny hips and exposed a hint of her backside

Sofia, who turned 22 on August 24th, celebrated another year around the sun with her family and friends during a lavish Mexican getaway.

In previous snaps from the day, Sofia flaunted her curves in the skimpy bikini, showing off a pair of high-rise bottoms that hugged her tiny hips and exposed a hint of her backside.  

She captioned her earlier post, 'Yesterday was a girls dream' and garnered many likes and comments from her close friends.

The cover girl has become incredibly close with the KarJenner clan, even inviting Kylie Jenner's best friend Stassie and former assistant Victoria on her tropical birthday getaway.

The relationship between Sofia and Scott started to go south after Scott was spotted at a rehab back in May. He has since been spending a lot of time with ex Kourtney Kardashian and their three children, even vacationing in Colorado with the family.

When she returned home from Mexico, Richie sparked relationship rumors with her longtime friend Jaden Smith. 

She's been friends with the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett for years and the pair were rumored to have dated when they were kids - nearly eight years ago.

They looked awfully cozy together over Labor Day weekend when they reunited for a fun day at the beach in Los Angeles on Saturday.

And, later the pair ventured up to the swanky Japanese restaurant Nobu in Malibu for a double date with their friend Moisés Arias and his girlfriend. 

The two spent 'all day and night,' together a source told E! on Sunday. 'They spent the afternoon playing on the beach together with friends.'

Adding: 'But Sofia and Jaden only had eyes for each other. They swam in the water together and wrapped their arms around each other. They held hands as they went in and out of the water and then they pulled each other in for a hug.'
