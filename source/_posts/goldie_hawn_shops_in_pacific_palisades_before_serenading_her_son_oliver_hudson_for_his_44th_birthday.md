Oscar winner Goldie Hawn and a gal pal shopped together at clothing boutique Vince inside the Palisades Village strip mall in Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades neighborhood on Monday.

The 74-year-old grandmother-of-six made sure to protect herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a black cloth mask, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for all public outings on June 18.

As of Monday, there have been over 248K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,030 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

Goldie was still wearing the black tank top, matching fanny pack, and purple leggings when she wished her eldest Oliver Hudson a happy 44th birthday by serenading him with Simon Ravenhall's 1939 song You Are My Sunshine.

Hawn - who boasts 4.2M social media followers - got emotional and teared up as she finished the verse, gushing: 'I love you, Oliver. Happy birthday baby!'

The Splitting Up Together actor and sister Kate Hudson are from the Washington, D.C.-born blonde's six-year marriage to second husband Bill Hudson, which ended bitterly in 1982.

Oliver has three children - son Wilder, 13; son Bodhi, 10; and daughter Rio, 7 - from his 14-year marriage to Erinn Bartlett.
