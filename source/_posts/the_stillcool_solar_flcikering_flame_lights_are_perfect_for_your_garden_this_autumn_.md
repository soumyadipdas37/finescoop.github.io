Solar lights are one way to instantly transform an outdoor space. Cheap, low-maintenance but highly effective, you just charge them up in the sun to create a stunning light display in the evening.

The StillCool Solar Flickering Dancing Flame Lights are the ultimate cosy lighting for autumn. Not only are they perfect for creating a warming ambience in your garden, but they won't affect your electricity bills either. 

Highly-rated and well-priced at only £30.99 for a pack of four, they are currently Amazon's Choice for 'Flame Solar Lights Outdoors'. 

The StillCool Solar Flickering Dancing Flame Lights are perfect for creating 'a really nice homey atmosphere in the garden'

Candles are perfect for creating a cosy atmosphere, particularly in autumn, but they aren't the most practical when kept outside.

If you're looking to recreate that warm, flickering glow, then the StillCool Solar Flickering Dancing Flame Lights are the next best thing. Safe and realistic, the lights are a huge hit with shoppers. In fact, the lights have awarded a near-perfect average score of 4.6 out of 5.  

To use, charge the solar lights in direct sunlight (it should take up to eight hours) then the solar panel will convert the sunlight into electrical energy, ready for 10 hours of battery charge. 

As the sunlight isn't as strong in the autumn, you should get at least five hours in autumn and winter after fully charged. While shoppers say these give a 'warm, cosy light', they aren't super bright, so if you're looking for powerful lights, then you may need electric ones. 

'These are really beautiful in the garden at night. The amount of light they put out is minimal, but as a decorative light, they are perfect. The flicker effect is very good & they are much bigger than I expected.' 

With no cords or wiring needed, you can place the StillCool Solar Lights wherever you like. Use them the line your pathway, place them at the entrance to your garden or put them in the flower beds to give a lovely glow at night. 

'Fantastic value for money' wrote one delighted shopper 'The warm candle-like glow and imagery they give out are second to none! They’re extremely realistic and give an excellent ambience to our rockery and water feature that they surround. I would 100% recommend these fantastic lights.'

Just charge the lights up in direct sunlight, so when night falls they'll illuminate the garden with a lovely glowing, flicking light 

Another agreed, writing: 'These lights are amazing. My husband was unsure on solar lights to begin with, but he absolutely loves these lights. We have had lots of compliments from our neighbours about them. They are beautiful when they come on and look like candles burning away with the flicker.' 

With 79 per cent of shoppers awarding the lights a full five-star rating, the review section is full of praise for the StillCool Solar Flickering Dancing Flame Lights. With easy installation, the pack of four lights are a quick, simple yet effective way of illuminating your outdoor space. 

'Great addition to our stay at home life this year' wrote one enthused shopper 'gives a lovely glow at nightfall to the garden.' 

Another raved: 'They look fantastic at night' wrote another shopper 'They flicker very convincingly and look far more substantial than the usual filling station offerings. They're not cheap, but they're worth the money.'
