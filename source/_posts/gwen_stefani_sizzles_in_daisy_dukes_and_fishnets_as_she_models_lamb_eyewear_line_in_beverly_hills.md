Gwen Stefani is a busy woman, recently nabbing her first CMT Music Award nomination, while preparing for her return to The Voice.

And the three-time Grammy winner is also maintaining her fashion and lifestyle brand LAMB, which she launched in 2003.

She sizzled in Daisy Dukes and fishnets Saturday, as she modeled some pieces from her LAMB eyewear line, during an on-location photo shoot in Beverly Hills.

The 50-year-old paired the barely-there cut-off denim shorts with a white tank top, exposing a black lace bra underneath.

She complemented the look with a green flannel shirt wrapped around her waist and a pair of white patent leather cowboy boot stilettos, featuring fringe in the back.

Gwen modeled several styles from her eyewear line, including some chunky readers and a pair of reflective gold-framed aviators.

She was also decked out in gold bling, including some necklaces that read 'Stefani' and 'Shelton,' in tribute to her relationship with Blake Shelton, 44.

The couple performed their duet Happy Anywhere at the Academy of Country Music Awards earlier this month, their first performance together at the awards show.

They sang in front of a green screen, which placed them at the Bluebird Cafe, one of three locations in Nashville where celebs made appearances for the event.

Meanwhile, their collab Nobody But You recently earned Stefani her first CMT Music Award nomination, as they're up for Collaborative Video of the Year. 

She's preparing to join Shelton, as she makes her return next month for season 19 of The Voice, where they first met on the judges panel back in 2014, before they began dating in November of 2019. 

The No Doubt frontwoman recently said of their quarantine in a promo video: 'It's been pretty magical for Blake and I and the kids because we don't ever have that much solid time together. We did do a lot of fun stuff. We did a lot of cooking.'

It comes after a source told Us Weekly something to the contrary: 'They feel suffocated and stressed. They’re both stretched to the limit.'

The couple previously made a huge investment in their future, dropping $13.2million on a mansion in Encino, in an off-market deal. 

The insider continued: 'Friends say this move has turned into a nightmare. This is the toughest period they’ve had so far without a doubt.'  

'They know how to compromise,' they said, adding that Stefani and Shelton have always found a way to 'work through any tension and look at the bigger picture.'
