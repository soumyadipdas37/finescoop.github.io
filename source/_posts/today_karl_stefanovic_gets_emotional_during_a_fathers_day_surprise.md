Karl Stefanovic received an early Father's Day present from his four-month-old daughter, Harper May, live on the Today show on Friday.

In the closing moments of the program, co-host Allison Langdon revealed she had arranged a surprise for Karl, 46, and newsreader Alex Cullen.

'I've actually got a bit of an early present for you both. Have a look,' Allison, 41, said.

Footage then played of Harper cooing in his mother Jasmine Yarbrough's arms.

Jasmine, a 36-year-old former model turned shoe designer, could be heard saying in the background: 'Happy Father's Day, daddy.'

'That's so cute,' a delighted Karl said in the studio. 'She's a beauty, isn't she?'

He also couldn't resist making a joke about the 'revealing bra' his wife was wearing in the video, which was recorded in the couple's Sydney home.

Alex's wife, Bonnie Campbell, also recorded a video tribute with their 18-month-old twin daughters, Evie and Audrey.

Sitting on the couch with their two children, Bonnie said: 'Audrey loves you, Evie loves you, and thank you for all the work you do for us.

'We love you so much. Thanks for all the nappy changes! Thanks for you amazing emu impersonation. We can't wait to see you soon. Happy Father's Day.'
