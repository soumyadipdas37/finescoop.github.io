The topic was raised when Ellen and her guest discussed her numerous grandchildren.

'Khloé and Tristan are hanging out a lot, so maybe more [grandchildren] with them?' suggested the talk show host. 

'You never know around here. Like I said, I never count anybody out for the count,' came the reality TV star's diplomatic reply.

However her daughter and her NBA star baby daddy have been nesting according to People, with the exes recently seen looking at properties in Los Angeles together. 

'Despite Khloé trying to keep their relationship more private, she is very much with Tristan,' said the magazine's sources. 

Khloé weathered Tristan's first cheating scandal in 2018, two days before she gave birth to the couple's daughter True.

Dailymail.com published images of Tristan getting close to a woman at New York nightclub as well as old surveillance footage of him and two women at a lounge in Washington DC.

The duo worked on their relationship and didn't break up until February 2019, when Tristan was caught kissing Kylie Jenner's former BFF Jordyn Woods at his home after a party.

She and her family shocked fans around the world when they revealed they're cancelling Keeping Up With The Kardashians after an impressive 14-year run.

And Kris Jenner has admitted the famous clan's decision to axe the E! show was 'kind of sudden' but gushed about having the 'best home moves in the world' as she appeared on Wednesday's edition of The Ellen DeGeneres show.

The businesswoman, 64, also shut down claims she'll be appearing on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as a regular castmember following the end of KUWTK as she admitted she's 'doesn't have enough time' to juggle another TV series.

Matriarch Kris has starred on the iconic programme since its inception in 2007 alongside her former spouse Caitlyn Jenner and her children Kourtney, 41, Kim, 39, Khloe, 36, Rob, 33, Kendall, 24, and Kylie, 23.

Shedding light on how the reality stars settled on surprise choice, the entrepreneur told host Ellen, 62: 'It was kind of sudden.

'We were talking about signing with our network for another couple of years, but we all came to the decision as a group, it just all came to us after 20 seasons and 14 years. 

'It's so weird to think that when we started the show, there was barely Twitter and no other social media sites, no grandchildren, people weren't married or divorced. It's amazing to think that I have the best home movies in the world.'

Admitting Khloe was 'pretty torn up' about their verdict, Kris added: 'The most emotional is Khloe, we all got emotional when we had to break it to the crew. We've been with the same crew since the start, they are now like extended family to us.

'Khloe was the saddest, she stayed with the crew for hours reminiscing about old times. This chapter has been so amazing, we're so blessed to have this experience.'

Elsewhere in the interview, the socialite broke her silence on rumours she could be set to switch lanes and join RHOBH.

'I would do it once in a while to be with my friend Kyle Richards': The socialite broke her silence on rumours she could be set to switch lanes and join RHOBH (pictured with Kyle in 2019)

She explained: 'I would do it once in a while to be with my friend Kyle Richards, but as far as me doing a show like that regularly, I just don't have enough time. They do not need a Kris Jenner on that show, they're doing just fine.' 

Presenter Ellen made a comeback to screens earlier this month after allegations of mistreatment and misconduct behind the scenes at her shows emerged. 

Throwing her support behind her longtime friend, Kris said: 'We've seen a storm or two in our day, we've been through a lot of crazy stuff, but the storm does past. 

'Hopefully we all come away with a lesson. I just love you so much, such a dear and wonderful friend, I'm so proud of you. You do things and give things to people that people don't even give about.' 

The season premiere for the show scored a 1.9 Nielsen household rating, the same number as last year, according to Variety.

The View was comfortably the winner on Monday night with a 2.7 rating. In the key demographic of those aged 25-54 however, The Ellen DeGeneres Show gained from a 0.9 from a 0.8 in 2019.
