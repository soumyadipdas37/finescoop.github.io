Coleen Rooney fuelled up on coffee as she headed out in Cheshire on Tuesday.

The WAG, 34, cut a casual figure in a grey hoodie and sports leggings as she did some last minute preparations ahead of taking her boys to school on Wednesday.

Coleen was every inch the proud mum as she took to Instagram to share a photo of Kai, 10, Klay, seven, and Kit, four, posing in their uniforms before doing the school run.

Coleen accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Good luck to my boys going back to school today. Love you all so much, be yourselves and keep smiling'. 

Before sending her three of her four boys back to school- the Liverpudlian beauty, who is also mum to Cass, two, appeared in high spirits as she stepped out in Cheshire clutching a diary. 

She paired her casual outfit with grey trainers and wore her hair in a high bun.

The mother-of-four appeared distracted as she gazed down at her phone while heading back to her car.   

Her outing comes after she reportedly declared she 'won't be bullied' by Rebekah Vardy, 38, when their libel case goes to court.  

Rebekah is said to have signed legal papers in a bid to get Coleen to head to court 'immediately' amid their ongoing WAG war.

But a source told The Sun last weekend 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'

Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'. 

It was reported that Rebekah has filed the papers under the impression that Coleen is 'dragging her heels' following her bombshell accusations she has been selling stories about her to The Sun. 

According to reports, the session, which will be held later this year, will determine whether the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy was 'libelled' when Coleen accused her Instagram account of leaking stories to the press. 

A source told the publication: 'Things have been rumbling on for ages, and costs ­spiralling too.

'This will mean that a judge can actually get to the crux of the case — and make those involved put up or shut up. It should mean things can finally get moving and dealt with quickly.

'This is a shot across the bows. It effectively says, "Come on, stop mucking about, let’s get on with this".'

MailOnline reached out to Rebekah and Coleen's representatives for comment at the time of publication. 

The two are currently engaged in an ongoing feud which began when Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies.
