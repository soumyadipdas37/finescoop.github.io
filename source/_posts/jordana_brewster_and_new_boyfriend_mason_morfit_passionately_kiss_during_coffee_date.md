She recently went public with her new businessman boyfriend Mason Morfit, months after announcing her amicable split from her husband of 13 years.

And Jordana Brewster was spotted putting on a decidedly passionate display with her beau on Thursday, as they enjoyed a coffee date in Brentwood, California.

The 40-year-old actress locked lips with Mason as the pair packed on the steamy PDA while sitting together on the terrace of popular Caffe Luxxe.

Donning sunglasses and a black leather jacket, the screen star wrapped her arms around Mason's shoulders as she pulled him in for the prolonged smooch.

According to an eyewitness, the pair cared very little about onlookers as they kissed in between enjoying their coffee.

The lovebirds then carried some food to go from the Farmshop to Jordana's SUV, where they are said to have continued kissing before driving off.

The Fast And The Furious star Jordana announced her 'amicable' split from her husband of 13 years, Andrew Form, earlier this year. 

A source close to the couple told People magazine at the time: 'They have the utmost respect for each other. 

'They remain committed to lovingly co-parent their two children as a team.' 

The pair, who are parents to sons Julian, six, and Rowan, four, first met on the set of the horror movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, which he produced and she starred in.

On their one-year anniversary, he proposed with a 3.2-carat engagement ring and they wed in a private ceremony after a six-month engagement.

Just after filing for divorce, Jordana was seen passionately kissing her new CEO beau, Mason, 44, on a romantic stroll in Malibu. 

Earlier this week, the actress posted their first official couple photo, with the two walking hand and hand from the ocean. 

She captioned the comment with a red heart, as she looked over at her handsome man in the snap.
