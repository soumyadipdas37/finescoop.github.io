Gareth Southgate has handed debut call-ups to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Harvey Barnes and Bukayo Saka for the forthcoming England triple-header.

The trio have been promoted into the senior squad for the first time following excellent performances for their clubs post-lockdown.

As revealed by Sportsmail this morning, Southgate has named an extended 30 man squad for the games against Wales, Belgium and Denmark amid fatigue concerns for a number of players.

Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been called-up for England for the very first time

Arsenal youngster Bukayo Saka and Leicester's Harvey Barnes are also handed debut call-ups 

England manager Gareth Southgate has named his squad for three international fixtures

Harry Maguire has been called up to the squad despite his forthcoming retrial after being found guilty on three operate counts following an incident involving police on the Greek island of Mykonos.

In contrast, Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden have been dropped following their Iceland team hotel shame.

Greenwood, 18, and Foden, 20, were dropped for the away clash at Denmark last month after sneaking girls into the team hotel in Iceland, breaking strict covid-bubble protocols in the process.

The pair have now been dropped from Southgate's latest squad for the games this month

But Harry Maguire has been recalled after being found guilty on three operate counts following an incident involving police on the Greek island of Mykonos in August

Goalkeepers: Dean Henderson, Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope

Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Conor Coady, Eric Dier, Joe Gomez, Michael Keane, Harry Maguire, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Tyrone Mings, Bukayo Saka, Kieran Trippier, Kyle Walker

Midfielders: Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount, Kalvin Phillips, Declan Rice, James Ward-Prowse, Harry Winks

Forwards: Tammy Abraham, Harvey Barnes, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jack Grealish, Danny Ings, Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Raheem Sterling 

Meanwhile, there's also a return for Ben Chilwell and Jordan Henderson, who missed September's matches due to injury.  

Other notable inclusions are Gunners defender Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Wolves skipper Conor Coady, Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish, who all retain their places following their first call-ups in September. 

Calvert-Lewin has been picked this month after five games in his first three Premier League matches, as well as a hat-trick in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.  

On picking the Premier League's joint-top scorer Calvert-Lewin, Southgate said: 'He's been in the pathway through the U21s, had a good season last season.

'A lot of Dominic's game I've liked for a long time, what he's adding now is the goals that haven't always been there and in the last 18 months or so he has really improved in that area.

'He's been a big part of Everton's starting the season as well as they have and I'm very pleased to be able to call him up for the first time.'

Calvert-Lewin, 23, admitted it was a 'dream come true' to be called-up to the senior England squad, saying: 'I'm a very, very proud man to get this first England call.

'I phoned my mum and my dad, and my mum burst into tears.

Calvert-Lewin has scored eight goals in all competitions already this season for Everton

'It's something we've spoken about since I was a young boy. To get here now and get the call-up is a dream come true. I'm very happy.'

England have three matches in this international break, starting with a friendly against Wales at Wembley on October 8.  

Southgate's side then face Belgium on October 11 and Denmark on October 14 at Wembley in the UEFA Nations League.
