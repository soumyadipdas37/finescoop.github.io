A football coach's daughter has triggered a heart stopping moment for WAGS and their families after changing the channel in the dying stages of a vital match.

Geelong Cats legend Corey Enright's daughter Luna was videoed pulling the plug on a TV in an adorable moment during their crunch match against the Sydney Swans on Sunday.

The one-year-old was watching the last game of the season with other families in the AFL's Gold Coast hub on Sunday, with her dad's old team needing a win to book in a top-four spot in the finals. 

The Cats had fought back from a 17-point deficit to claim the lead in the final stages, leaving the diehard supporters on the edge of their seats.

That was when young Luna decided to change the channel.

When the Swans fought back with a late charge and kicked a crucial goal in the final two minutes, they were within range of stealing victory and breaking Cats hearts.

With only 19 seconds remaining in the final quarter and the Swans behind by six points with the ball in hand, Luna wandered over to the TV set.

She fumbled with the TV box and changed the channel, sending the crowd into hysterics.

Her mother Renee rushed over to change the channel back, before accidentally putting on a rugby league match.

Despite Luna's bungle, the crowd were elated when the Cats hung on for the win. Pictured: Geelong development coach Corey Enright with his wife Renee and children Luna, Tex and Boh

The families endured an agonising wait, with WAGS and children screaming as Mrs Enright scrolled through the TV channels.

After she finally found the broadcast, the final score lit up on the scream, sending a deafening roar through the hub.

Footage of the dramatic moment was posted on AFL's Instagram page, with commentators loving Luna's cute display.

'Absolutely brilliant!' one comment reads.

'This is so good!' another post reads.
