A third walker has been trampled to death by a herd of cows this month in Yorkshire and Northumberland - amid a spate of recent stampedes that has prompted the National Farmers' Union to issue a warning to others.

An unnamed man in his 50s was pronounced dead after he was chased down by cows while out walking with a woman in a field in Netherton, West Yorkshire, just before 1pm on Tuesday.

The woman, also aged in her 50s, was airlifted to hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

It has prompted the National Farmers' Union (NFU) to warn of the dangers of walking too closely to a herd of cattle. 

Three walkers have been killed by stampeding cows in Northumberland and Yorkshire in just three weeks 

Earlier this month Dave Clark, deputy head of Richmond School in North Yorkshire, died while walking his dog in a field in Richmond on September 21.

And Malcom Flynn, 72, from Carlisle, was killed on September 11 when cows charged him near Thirlwall Castle in Northumberland.

Stuart Roberts, the deputy chairman of the NFU, told The Times cows could be threatened by the presence of dogs.

'If your dog is being threatened by cows, let it go,' he said. 'Cattle will chase dogs instead of you. Generally, dogs will outrun cattle.'

He also asked walkers to slowly move away from the animals, rather than launching into a sprint if under threat. 

Out of 43 incidents of cattle injuring people between 2018 and last year a dog was involved in 18 of the cases, according to an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.

The NFU has called for an amendment to the Highways Act 1980 to allow farmers to divert public rights of way where animals are present. 

A spokesman said: 'Walking in the countryside is a pleasure enjoyed by millions of people every year without mishap and it is with sadness that we have learnt of the recent incident in which a member of the public lost their life while out walking.'

Following Mr Clark's death on September 21 tributes were led by headteacher Jenna Potter, who said in a statement: 'Dave Clark was the "heart and soul" of Richmond School.

'He was an enormous character, a brilliant school leader and simply a lovely man who enriched the life of everyone he came into contact with, just by being himself and doing what he did every day.

'Dave was always the person we looked to to deal with difficult issues and he was a master at that. 

'He never let students get away with being anything other than their very best, never giving up on them, even when at times it felt as though they wanted to give up on themselves. 

'All of this, Dave did with a smile and a level of kindness and care that is seldom seen.

'Outside school, Dave was a keen sportsman. He had grown to love the Dales and would often be seen cycling, walking and spending time on the moor during the beating season. 

'Our students and their parents have been lucky to have known and been helped by him. We have been privileged as a staff to have worked with him and will continue working in the same way in his memory.

'Above all, Dave was a family man. Our thoughts are with Dave's wife, his children and wider family at this difficult time.'  

According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Clark was educated at Jordanhill College in Glasgow and was a keen cyclist, swimmer and rugby coach 

One parent said all four of his children had known Mr Clark over the years and spoke very highly of him.

Another said: 'He was really popular, one of the good guys. It's just incredibly sad. 

'He'd been there forever - even when pupils had left he remembered their names and would ask how they were doing.'

His local cycling club paid tribute to him on Facebook, saying: 'It is with immense sadness that we learned today that one of the club's most respected and long standing members, David Clark passed away due to a tragic accident. 

'David was walking with his dogs on the outskirts of the town, off the town's Hurgill Road, on Monday evening when the incident happened. 

'Our thoughts are with David's family and friends who must be devastated and within the club there is deep sadness and shock.'

According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Clark was educated at Jordanhill College in Glasgow and was a keen cyclist, swimmer and rugby coach.
