Lukasz's father Paul Kłosowski, 46, (pictured) pleaded guilty to two counts of murder 

A father has pleaded guilty to murdering his son and the teenager's girlfriend while they visited him on his rural property. 

Pawel Klosowski, 46, of Mount McIntyre in South Australia, appeared in Mt Gambier Magistrates Court on Monday where he admitted to killing his son Lukasz Klosowski and his girlfriend Chelsea Ireland, both aged 19.

Police were called to his property on August 23 after reports of a shooting and arrested Klosowski without incident.

His two younger step children reportedly witnessed the grim double-shooting. 

Speaking to reporters at the scene, Detective Inspector Campbell Hill described the deaths as a 'shocking incident to occur in the southeast'.

'It's a tragic event and the impacts of this will not only be felt for the particular families involved, and the associates and the relatives, but also for the southeastern community,' Inspector Hill said at the time.

Klosowski's early guilty plea could entitle him to a discount of up to 40 per cent on any non-parole period.

His case was not expected back in court until December but was reviewed late on Monday afternoon, the final day he could enter an early guilty plea.

Ms Ireland's family revealed she was passionate about the environment and determined to 'change the world' after learning of her death.

They remembered the mechanical engineering student as someone who left a lasting impression on everyone she met.

'Chelsea was compassionate, strong, selfless and fearless and continues to make us proud every day,' her father Greg Ireland said.

'We haven't just lost a daughter, we've lost a best friend. Our hearts will forever remain broken.'

Debra Ireland said her daughter was passionate about environmental care and making changes to save the planet.

'She was going to change the world,' Mrs Ireland said.

'She not only talked about it, she lived it.'

The family said Chelsea and Lukasz were great mates and had 'just bonded'.

Her devastated parents previously recalled the final moment they shared with their daughter - the morning before the tragedy. 

'I went in and kissed her goodbye and said…''be careful on that road'' and she said ''what do you think Lukasz is going to do? He's not stupid'',' Mrs Ireland told The Advertiser.

Mr Ireland also gave his daughter a hug and said he loved her. 

'From an early age, I've always said to the girls ''dads always need hugs'' so I go up, give them a hug and tell them I love them… so I did that with Chelsea,' he said. 

Chelsea's 21-year-old sister Maddie sent her a message about a double rainbow the day before her death, which she will forever remember as their final conversation. 

Mrs Ireland said her daughter had only met the accused killer four times - twice when he took the couple for dinner in Adelaide, and twice in Mount Gambier, near his property.

'I just keep wishing I could have said to her don't go but she was 19, she had travelled Europe on her own. She was street-smart, independent, strong-willed – there was no way I could have held her home, but I just wish I could have,' the mother-of-two said.

Kłosowski had barely seen his son since his relationship with Lukasz's mother Magdalena broke down in 2005.

Photos of Lukasz about that time show him with his mother, and another clutching a decoration reading 'Sto Lat (Happy Birthday) Lukasz'.

Family friends said Magdalena limited contact between her ex-husband and her son, and later started dating a woman she is still in a relationship with.

Kłosowski and Lukasz only occasionally crossed paths until recent years when he tried to mend fences after marrying his wife Monica.

However, Kłosowski noted his son's absence from numerous family photos with his three stepchildren and called him 'stubborn'. 

Two of his stepchildren, all aged under 14, witnessed the shooting, Mount Gambier Magistrates' Court heard on August 24.

The Ireland family are still in shock and told the publication they never thought 'tragedies you see in the paper' would happen to them. 

Despite her violent death, the family remembered Chelsea's sense of adventure and kind heart.

Chelsea and Lukasz dated for several years and had travelled the world together, exploring his Polish heritage.

They attended different Adelaide high schools - Lukasz at Christian Brothers College and Chelsea at St Mary's College.

Lukasz was studying journalism at the University of South Australia while working at KFC.

His girlfriend was enrolled in mechanical engineering at Adelaide University and working at Baker's Delight.

In an assessment for Adelaide University, the student shared an experience she had visiting an indigenous community on the outskirts of The Great Victoria Desert.

She said it empowered her to want to improve the quality of life for those living in remote communities.

Klosowski has been remanded in custody to appear in the Supreme Court in Mt Gambier in November for arraignment and sentencing submissions. 

When she was just 15 years old, Chelsea watched a YouTube video that inspired her to donate her waist-length brown locks to cancer patients
