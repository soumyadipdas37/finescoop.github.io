Louise Redknapp has admitted she was threatened with a ban from her son's football matches for shouting.

The singer, 45, is mother to Charles, 16, and Beau, 11, and told how her antics at her younger son's matches almost got her in trouble with referees.

Speaking to The Telegraph magazine, she said: 'Beau's signed to Chelsea's under-12s team and parents aren't supposed to shout during their matches.

'Sometimes I do and get told I won't be allowed to go if I do it again.'

Louise shares her sons with her ex Jamie Redknapp who she divorced in 2017 after 19 years of marriage. 

Earlier this month, Louise shared a snap of herself alongside her sons after spending the summer with them in Ibiza.

She wrote: 'So grateful for the Summer Holiday I had with my boys and amazing friends.'

Now back home from Spain, Louise shared a Boomerang clip of three suitcases as she joked about putting the washing on now she was back in her house.

The star has had plenty of home time as she had to quarantine for two weeks with her sons after returning.  

Louise's holiday comes hot on the heels of the news that her ex-husband Jamie has moved on with a new love, Swedish model Frida Andersson-Lourie.

The former footballer, 47, was photographed heading on a dog walk with the mother-of-four, 37, near his home in Surrey last week in pictures obtained by The Sun.

It is thought to be Jamie's first confirmed relationship since his split from Louise.

A source told the publication: 'Jamie feels ready to move on from his marriage to Louise and is happy to be doing it with someone who has kids too and is financially secure.

'It's early days for Jamie and Frida, but they have grown close and are really enjoying spending time together when they can.'

Frida is currently signed to Mrs Robinson Management, an agency for older models, and has previously appeared in content for designer brands such as Escada.

The beauty currently lives with her four children in a lavish mansion in West London after divorcing 58-year-old American hedge fund tycoon Jonathan Lourie.
