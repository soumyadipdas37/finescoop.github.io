Kylie Jenner kept a very low profile in her first sighting since the shock cancellation of her family's reality show. 

The youngest member of the Kardashian/Jenner clan seemed to be feeling camera shy as she covered her face while attending a TIK TOK party at 40 Love in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 

The lip kit mogul, 23, also changed up her style for the party, sheathing her famous curves in a baggy top and jeans.

Hiding her ample assets and tiny waist, the mother-of-one slipped into a khaki slogan T-shirt that she teamed with bleached bootleg jeans.

Injecting some glamour with her accessories, Kylie toted a cream Dior saddle bag and sported a myriad of silver bangles and rings. 

She completed the look with a nude coloured face mask and sported a glossy chestnut wig that cascaded past her shoulders.

Stepping out: This marked Kylie's first sighting since the shock news Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be coming to an end next year. She is yet to comment publicly on the matter

Kylie's outing came after it was revealed that Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be coming to an end next year.

The series, which made the family household names, will conclude with its 20th season after 14 years on the air. 

Kim Kardashian was the first member of the family to break the news, with a statement on Instagram, with the rest of her sisters following suit.

The shocking announcement did not give a specific reason for pulling the plug of the reality show, but the Kardashian clan did take the time to thank their devout following for their support over the years. 

Speculation has been rife over the reason for the shock cancellation, with the reports circulating it was due to the show's dwindling ratings but also as the family have been hit by personal struggles.

Kim's husband Kanye West, 43, suffered a very public breakdown and Kim reportedly refused to reference Kanye's episode on the show.

Kourtney also decided to take a step back to focus on motherhood.

Kylie - who had her own spin-off show off the back of the series - has yet to acknowledge the news on social media. 

Instead, the reality star spent the night on a fun family get-together as she tried to take a family photo with her squirmy two-year-old daughter Stormi and her ex Travis Scott, 28. 

'pics with 2 year olds,' captioned Kylie, who had on a stunning all black ensemble as Travis smiled next to her. 

Later, they joined her mother Kris Jenner, 64, for a movie in an IMAX theater that they appeared to have rented to themselves.
