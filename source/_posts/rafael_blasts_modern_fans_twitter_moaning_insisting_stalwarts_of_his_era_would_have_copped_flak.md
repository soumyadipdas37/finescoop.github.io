Rafael da Silva has encouraged Manchester United fans to be patient with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s approach as he criticises their social media interjections. 

The former United full-back believes fans are too quick to write off players who aren’t an instant success and claims that historic club players such as Wesley Brown, John O’Shea, Darren Fletcher would have been branded as 'f***ing s***' by the modern day supporter. 

As United enter into the final week of the transfer window and the demand for new signings heightens, Rafael begs fans to 'relax and trust' the club and their current players as there is too much 'negativity' around 'good players' online.  

Rafael has encouraged Man United fans to be patient with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s approach

He told The Athletic: 'If you see some players who played very well for Manchester United, these days if they played in this team … I speak about Wesley Brown, John O’Shea, Darren Fletcher … I speak about many of us, players who are good Manchester United players historically. But these days, everyone would have said, “F***ing s**t, why is this guy playing for United?”

‘Fucking hell, guys, these players are there for a reason, give them some trust and confidence. I am not saying everything is right at United. Many things went wrong and they did wrong but not everything is s**t.

Rafael claims that modern day fans would even called club legend John O’Shea 'f***ing s**t'

The former United full-back also said fans would have also criticised the likes of Wes Brown

‘You see Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Even Fred. Fred is not a flop. He is a good player and sometimes he is not even playing. 

'You say you want more midfielders? F****ing hell, Fred is not even playing sometimes. 

'You say he is a bad player? He is not a bad player. We need a left-back now. Let’s get a good one. Alex Telles is a very good player and I know him.

‘But these days, Twitter. People are there, like a computer, saying, “Delete the club” or “S**t coach, s**t player”. 

'Sometimes you cannot go to Twitter to see if a player is good or not. There are too many negative things. We do need to relax and trust people, just that little bit more.’

Rafael joined United in 2008 along with twin brother Fabio and spent seven years at Old Trafford before signing for Lyon in 2015. 

He says that fans should have 'confidence' in players such as Fred because he is 'good player'

Rafael hopes his plea for social media positivity will help players like himself thrive at United

During that time he established himself as a fan favourite among the Manchester United supporters.

Rafael was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award in his debut season and became one of the first names on the team sheet under Sir Alex Ferguson. 

Rafael might not have been one the best United players of all time, but he had the respect of the fans after helping the Red Devils pick up three Premier League titles during his time at the club.

He hopes his plea for more social media positivity will help players like himself thrive during their time at Manchester United.
