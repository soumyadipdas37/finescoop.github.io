Australian shoppers can save more than $40 by buying eight Aldi cleaning products instead of similar items from rival supermarkets.

In an advertisement in the latest store catalogue, the German-owned retail giant compared the prices of its own-brand laundry, kitchen and bathroom cleaners to names like Vanish, Pine Cleen and Omo. 

Eight items cost $27.52 at Aldi while similar products cost $67.70 in other stores, amounting to impressive savings of $40.18 - or 59 percent - every time you shop.

The comparison was based on prices available at 10 outlets from two major supermarket chains in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia on August 26, 2020, according to the fine print.
