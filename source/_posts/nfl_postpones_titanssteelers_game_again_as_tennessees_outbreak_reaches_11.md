The NFL is further postponing the Titans' upcoming game against the Pittsburgh Steelers after another Tennessee player and team employee tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the club's total to 11 infections.  

The league announced Wednesday that, due to the Titans' outbreak, the Week 4 matchup would be postponed until Monday or Tuesday of next week. On Thursday the NFL adopted a more cautious approach. 

'The decision to postpone the game was made to ensure the health and safety of players, coaches and game day personnel,' read the league's statement on Thursday. 'The Titans facility will remain closed and the team will continue to have no in-person activities until further notice.'

The NFL is expected to announce a make-up date in the coming days. 

On Tuesday, the Titans placed three players on the reserve/COVID-19 list, including key players defensive captain and lineman DaQuan Jones and long snapper Beau Brinkley. Outside linebacker Kamalei Correa became the fourth on that list Wednesday.  

The NFL had played three weeks without a COVID-19 outbreak, but both the Titans and Minnesota Vikings had to shutter their practice facilities this week after Tennessee's situation was revealed. The two teams played in Minneapolis on Sunday. 

The Vikings released a statement saying they had not received any positive results from their testing after Sunday's game and they followed NFL protocol by closing their facility immediately. The Minnesota complex is scheduled to re-open Thursday.
