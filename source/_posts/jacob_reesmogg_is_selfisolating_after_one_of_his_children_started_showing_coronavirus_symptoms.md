Jacob Rees-Mogg is self-isolating after one of his six children started showing coronavirus symptoms.

The Leader of the House of Commons is remaining at home while waiting for the results of a Covid-19 test.

One of his children - Peter, 12, Mary, 11, Thomas, ten, Anselm, eight, Alfred, four and Sixtus, three - started exhibiting coronavirus symptoms. 

His eldest five children had their first day back at £18,000-a-year school Hill House in London last week. 

Deputy chief whip Stuart Andrew stood in for Rees-Mogg at business questions on Thursday. 

Rees-Mogg took to Twitter to explain his absence, writing: 'Many thanks to Stuart Andrew for standing in for me at Business Questions.

'One of my children was tested for COVID-19 last weekend after displaying symptoms. 

'In accordance with government guidance, the household has been in self-isolation while we await the test result.' 

Mr Andrew told the Commons: 'A member of the Leader of the House's household is awaiting a Covid test result after having been symptomatic. 

'The leader is therefore self-isolating along with his family.' 

Rees-Mogg's brood attend Hill House - Prince Charles's alma mater - where fees range from £14,400 for infants to £18,000 for sixth formers. 

Rees-Mogg shared a family photograph of his five eldest children in uniform on the morning of their first day back at school last week.
