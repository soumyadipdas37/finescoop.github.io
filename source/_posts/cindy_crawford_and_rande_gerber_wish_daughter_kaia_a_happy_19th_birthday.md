Model Kaia Gerber turned 19-years-old on Thursday.

Her doting parents, supermodel Cindy Crawford and business mogul Rande Gerber, each took to social media with sweet tributes to their 'not so little' girl. 

Kaia, meanwhile, is rumored to be beginning a budding romance with 23-year-old Australian actor Jacob Elordi. 

Celebration! Model Kaia Gerber turned 19-years-old on Thursday and her doting parents, Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber, each took to social media with sweet tributes to their 'not so little' girl

Cindy gushed in a sweet Instagram post: 'Happy birthday to my not so little princess! Wishing you health and happiness and the confidence to be the highest version of yourself.'

'So proud of the woman you are becoming,' she penned in the caption.

The affectionate post included two throwback photos of a young Kaia - already looking like a little model.

The first sees the the future catwalker all smiles at one of her birthday parties, dressed in a pink princess down and a gold crown, from when she looked to be around four or five years old.

In her Instagram Story, Cindy posted an even younger birthday photo of Kaia - possibly her first - wearing a fuzzy pink party hat.

Cindy, who looks like she's barely aged a bit, smiled sweetly next to her baby in the vintage party shot.

Rande, meanwhile, shared a snap of his only daughter from when she was 14. The photogenic beauty smiled brightly at the camera, makeup free, in a black bikini top.

'Happy Birthday my little angel. I thought I was in trouble when I took this 5 years ago but your beauty on the inside has proven to be even bigger than your smile. I love you forever,' he wrote in the caption.

Along with Kaia, Rande and Cindy are also parents to older son Presley, 21. 

The top model may be entering into the final year of her teens with a new man on her slim arm.

She and Euphoria hunk Jacob Elordi were enjoyed a late dinner at the celeb-beloved Nobu Malibu on Tuesday. 

After dinner, he, Kaia and her sweet little pooch hopped into his Range Rover and drove off.

While the pair definitely seemed close, there didn't appear to be anything romantic between the two but something may be on the horizon. 

Jacob has kept quite quiet about his love life, but seems to meet his ladies on set.

He previously dated Kissing Booth co-star Joey King but had most recently been linked to his Euphoria co-star Zendaya, 24.

The Aussie actor and former Disney Channel star sparked romance rumors earlier this year after being spotted in NYC and Jacob's native Australia together, but have since been quarantining on separate continents.

A source told E! News in an article Wednesday that Kaia and Jacob have been friends for some time.

'Jacob definitely has interest in dating Kaia, but there is nothing serious going on there,' the insider said. 'They have many mutual friends and have hung out many times in the past. They both have very chill personalities and similar interests. Jacob makes Kaia laugh and her family adores him'.

Kaia has been keeping it friendly but they do flirt with each other, the source said, while adding, 'She has told friends she is single and is only having fun and hanging out with people'.
