Stephen King's iconic 1978 novel The Stand comes to life in the first trailer for the highly-anticipated CBS All Access limited series, which was first showcased during the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards.

The trailer (via CBS All Access YouTube) offers a first look at this star-studded cast, including Whoopi Goldberg playing Mother Abagail, James Marsden as Stu Redman and Alexander Skarsgard portraying Randall Flagg.

The beloved novel was originally adapted into a four-episode mini-series by CBS in 1994, starring Gary Sinise as Stu Redman, Ruby Dee as Mother Abigail and Jamey Sheridan as Randall Flagg.

The trailer begins with a young woman named Frannie Goldsmith (Odessa Young) walking through a cornfield, when she comes to a mysterious circular clearing, where she meets Abagail.

'My name is Abigail Freemantle. You come see me at Hemingfoot Home,' Mother Abigail tells the awestruck young woman.

The rest of the 30-second teaser is comprised of brief shots of several main characters, who are dealing with the aftermath of an influenza pandemic that kills nearly the entire world's population.
