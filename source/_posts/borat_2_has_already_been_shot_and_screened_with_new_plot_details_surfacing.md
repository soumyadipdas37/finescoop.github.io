After Sacha Baron Cohen was spotted filming something as his famous Borat character last month in Long Beach, speculation surfaced about a sequel, which has now been confirmed.

Borat 2 has already been filmed and screened for 'a select few industry types,' according to a new report from Collider. 

Cohen, 48, had previously revealed in 2007 that he was planning to retire both his Borat and Ali G characters, though it seems he had a change of heart.

The sequel reportedly follows Cohen's Borat, who, after the release of the 2006 Borat film, thinks he's a huge movie star.

He tries hiding from the public, interviewing people while taking on different alter-egos along the way.

One source described the meta sequel as, 'Cohen playing Borat playing Cohen.'

There is no indication who financed the sequel, and if it has been set up at a studio at this time, though the report hints that a streaming service may be behind the project.

20th Century Fox distributed the first film, entitled Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, though the studio is now owned by Disney, which has had little to no interest in R-rated movies in the past.

The original film was a surprise box office hit, earning $128.5 million domestic and $262.5 million worldwide, from just an $18 million budget.

Borat also earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for Cohen and co-writers Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, Dan Mazer and Todd Philipps. 

The Borat character debuted on Cohen's hit TV series Da Ali G show, along with Bruno, a character who also got his own movie in 2009. 

Borat followed Cohen's title character, a TV journalist from Kazakhstan who is sent to America with a documentary crew and producer Azamat (Ken Davitan).

Once in America, though, Borat becomes obsessed with finding and marrying Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. 

Rumors of a sequel first surfaced last month, when a TikTok user spotted Cohen in his traditional grey Borat suit driving a beat-up old yellow truck, with a truck ahead of him filming in Long Beach, California.

There is no indication if Ken Davitan is back as Azamat, or if director Larry Charles is returning for the sequel.
