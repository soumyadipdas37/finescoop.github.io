A cancer sufferer has been overwhelmed with offers from kind neighbours after losing his last $50.

Sam had been attending a treatment clinic in Balmain, in Sydney's inner west, on Monday when he lost his cash and Medicare card. 

He made a desperate plea to the Balmain Living group on Facebook and offered 'whatever favour' in return for the money.   

Recent cancer sufferer Sam (pictured) made a heartbreaking plea to a Facebook group after losing his last $50 note while attending a treatment clinic in Sydney's inner west 

Sam said he dropped his money and Medicare card somewhere near Woolworths in Balmain (pictured above). He later found the card but his cash had gone missing 

'I had been getting blood tests due to my recent battle with cancer in Balmain today,

'And dropped my money clip with my Medicare card and my last $50 near Woolworths or Taste Baguette,' Sam's post read. 

'After 30 minutes of searching I found my card in the gutter on Beatie Street but not the clip and the money.'  

The cancer sufferer also provided the heartbreaking explanation behind why he needed the cash. 

'If anyone found it, or knows who did, can you please let me know as I need medication with that money. 

'I will do you whatever favour you want if you can return. And you will get really good karma,' he wrote. 

There was an outpouring of support from residents who offered to donate money for the medication.   

'Sorry to hear this. If you don't find it, happy to pitch in $10. Take care. 

Generous community members quickly offered to donate the $50 back to Sam and he said he was overwhelmed (pictured above) and couldn't stop crying from the generous act 

'Let us know how you go and if no lucky by tonight, send me your account details,' one thoughtful commenter wrote. 

Several other users added they would be 'happy to chip in'.   

Sam quickly confirmed the money in his account had already reached $50 thanks to the generous donations.   

'Thanks so much for the offers but I can't take money off anyone else now, it wouldn't be right. 

'But thank you so much, it's been amazing, the generosity has overwhelmed me in the best way.  

'I can't stop crying. Thank you all. What an amazing community,' he wrote. 

Other users also commended their 'wonderful community' and wished Sam 'all the best for a full recovery'.   

'Thank you, I'm overwhelmed and crying from everyone's generosity,' he said. 

The cancer sufferer refused to accept offers of any extra money or help (Australian $50 note pictured above)
