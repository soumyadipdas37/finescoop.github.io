Manchester City announced the return of Lucy Bronze as the three-time Women's Champions League winner pens a two-year deal. 

Bronze has established herself as England's best player and was poached from City by Lyon in 2017, where she went on to win a glut of trophies. 

But after her contract in France expired Bronze has returned to Manchester to further strengthen City in their bid to win the Women's Super League title for the first time since 2016. 

Lucy Bronze has elected to re-join Manchester City after the defender chose to leave Lyon

'I'm really happy to be back here at City – I always had it in my mind that I would return one day, and it just feels like the perfect time and opportunity right now,' Bronze, 28, said. 

'I really enjoyed my time in France, but there were so many things that I missed and it's great to be back.

'I feel like I'm returning as a better leader and person, who is capable of bringing similar success to the table here in England – both domestically with City and internationally too.

 Bronze lifts the trophy in her final game for Lyon as they beat Wolfsburg in Women's Champions League final held in San Sebastian, Spain, last month

'Having already experienced everything that City have to offer as a Club, it was a no-brainer for me when the offer came in and there isn't another team in England that I would have looked at.

'There's nowhere I'd rather be right now than with Manchester City and I'm really excited to see what the future holds with the exciting squad we have here.'  

Bronze's arrival means they have 10 recognised England internationals to call upon for the WSL season.

As well as Bronze, head coach Gareth Taylor has Steph Houghton, Ellie Roebuck, Jill Scott, Demi Stokes, Esme Morgan, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway, Chloe Kelly and Ellen White in his squad. 

Taylor described Bronze's return as 'incredibly exciting' for the club and believes her 'unrivalled talent' can give City an edge over rivals Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. 

England international Bronze has 'unrivalled talent', according to City boss Gareth Taylor 

'We're absolutely thrilled to see Lucy return to Manchester City and I'm sure I speak on behalf of everyone when I say that we're delighted to have her back at the Club,' he said.

'She is an unrivalled talent and her endless individual and team awards only scratch the surface of what a superb player she is, not only at Club level, but also internationally with England.

'She joins us off the back of a hugely successful few years in France and being able to add a player of her quality to our already ambitious squad is incredibly exciting.'
