A mother who swung a sledge hammer at police while her son stabbed a detective to death at their home will be released on parole. 

Fiona Barbieri and her son Mitchell admitted killing 45-year-old Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson during a violent confrontation at Oakville, in Sydney's north-west, on December 6, 2012.

Police were called to their home after Mr Barbieri fired his crossbow at an electrician, before the pair locked themselves inside with a cache of weapons including swords, a gas bottle flamethrower and Molotov cocktails. 

Det Insp Anderson was stabbed several times by Mr Barbieri with a hunting knife when he entered the property during the siege.

Ms Barbieri, who was then 47, came out of the house swinging a sledgehammer and bit another policeman on the arm.

Witnesses during Ms Barbieri's sentencing said they heard her scream after Det Insp Anderson was injured 'it's his own f**king fault, he f**king deserved it' and 'let the dog c**t die, he deserves to f**king die'.

The judge in sentencing said Ms Barbieri had paranoid and psychotic delusions, and Mr Barbieri had been suffering transferred delusional disorder at the time. 

Ms Barbieri was sentenced to 10 years behind bars, including nine years for the manslaughter of Det Insp Anderson, with a non-parole period of six years and six months, which expired in June.

Mr Barbieri was given 35 years, with a non-parole period of 26 years.

The State Parole Authority on Tuesday ordered Fiona Barbieri be released from jail no later than September 15 after evidence from a forensic psychiatrist.

The Police Association of NSW says it is 'shocked and appalled' by the decision and Fiona Barbieri should remain behind bars until her maximum sentence expires in December 2022.

'The killing of Bryson Anderson was a horrific criminal act and has left a lifelong scar on his family and everyone who knew Bryson,' association president Tony King said in a statement.

'This decision is deplorable. It does nothing to take into account the ongoing impact on Bryson Anderson's family who lost a loving husband and father, and instead is an insult to his memory.'

In a report to the SPA, Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network psychiatrist Gordon Elliott submitted Ms Barbieri's mental health had significantly stabilised, leaving her a low risk to community safety.

The SPA ordered an additional psychiatric assessment in May last year to gauge her mental health, including her compliance with treatment and medication.

Dr Elliott noted Ms Barbieri had been 'scrupulously compliant' with medication and treatment, with no concerns or incidents reported throughout her seven years and six months in custody.

He reported the inmate 'does not have any symptoms of psychosis or of any other mental health problems' and concluded she 'represents a low risk for violent offending and offending generally'.

At a parole review hearing on Tuesday, the SPA considered evidence from medical experts, advice from Community Corrections and submissions from the victim's family and the Corrective Services commissioner.

The SPA extended its sympathy for the immeasurable loss of Det Insp Anderson, acknowledging the pain and suffering of the Anderson family and his police colleagues, adding no sentence would compensate for the loss of his life.

However, it considered it paramount for community safety that Ms Barbieri be released before her full sentence expired in order to ensure a lengthy period of reintegration under strict supervision and subject to conditions.

Ms Barbieri's lawyer Stephen Alexander read a statement from his client at the hearing.

'Ms Barbieri apologises to the family and friends of the late Inspector Anderson and to the Commissioner and to NSW Police and is sorry for their loss,' he said, as reported by SMH.

Ms Barbieri is subject to 18 strict bail conditions on her release including no taking drugs, contacting her son or visiting four government areas in the Hawkesbury region where the murder took place.
