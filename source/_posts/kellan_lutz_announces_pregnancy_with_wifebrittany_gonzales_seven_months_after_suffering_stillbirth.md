Kellan Lutz shared some devastating news earlier this year, when his and wife Brittany Gonzales' first pregnancy ended with a stillbirth.

But the North Dakota-born actor and his wife have kept their spirits high, as they continued to work on starting a family.

He stepped out Monday with his glowing bride, before they took to Instagram Live to reveal they're pregnant once again, while debuting her growing baby bump.

Brittany added: 'It was a surprise. You know, obviously it was a surprise losing our daughter at the beginning of the year. That was tough, and still is. There still are hard moments. 

'We definitely went through a lot, and I still would like to share my journey in some way that I can in the future. Here we are with another little promise!'

The couple announced their first pregnancy last November, two years after revealing they'd tied the knot.

Brittany wrote in part: 'I don’t know why it happened the way it did, but part of me finds so much peace knowing you never experienced pain or heartache and never will.
