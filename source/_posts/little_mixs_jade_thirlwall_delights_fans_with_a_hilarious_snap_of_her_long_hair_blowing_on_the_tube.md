Challenge: The singer, 27, asked her fans to come up with some entertaining caption options for the image

Jade was pictured calmly looking down at her phone while her stunning wavy locks had other ideas and blew towards an open window in the carriage.

Sharing the entertaining image with her 6.7m followers, Jade invited her fans to think of something funny and wrote: 'Caption this. Best one gets f**k all.'

The replies soon flooded in with several people making references to Little Mix's recently announced sixth-studio album Confetti as well as social distancing rules.

One person wrote 'when your hair do all the social distancing for you' and another added 'new social distancing precautions trialled on London Underground'.

It comes after Little Mix delighted their fans by revealing they have big plans for the next few months and 2021.

Last Friday the girls - Jade, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson - announced their arena tour for Confetti, which is due for release on 6th November.

The tour will include hits such as Holiday and Break Up Song, alongside some of their greatest hits such as Woman Like Me, Black Magic and Shout Out To My Ex. 

For the event Little Mix have chosen to partner with both Black Minds Matter UK and Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy, with a £1 of the ticketing fees (per ticket) being split between the two groups.

The Confetti tour will kick off in Dublin on Wednesday 28 April 2021 and then head to Belfast, Liverpool and Sheffield. Other locations include Newcastle, Cardiff, Leeds, London, Nottingham and Birmingham.
