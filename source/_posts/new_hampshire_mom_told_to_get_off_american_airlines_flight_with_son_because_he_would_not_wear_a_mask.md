A mother from New Hampshire is vowing to never fly American Airlines again after being forced off a flight after her crying two-year-old son refused to put on a face mask.

Rachel Davis was flying from Charlotte, North Carolina to Manchester, New Hampshire when she was approached by a flight attendant who demanded the toddler, called Lyon, put on a face mask or get off the plane.

The pair had not yet sat down in their seats but Davis explained that despite attempting to put a mask on her on her little boy, he was not cooperating and his being tired after a week of traveling was making things all the more difficult. 

Rachel Davis was flying from Charlotte, North Carolina to Manchester, New Hampshire with her two-year-old son, Lyon but they were kicked off because he refused to wear a face mask

'I tried repeatedly, begged him, bribed him, pleaded with him, did everything I could while he was screaming and crying as I tried to hold him and put the mask on, feeling my absolute lowest of lows as a mother,' Davis wrote in an Instagram post. 

'I told the flight attendant this is our fourth American Airlines flight this week, and he has never been asked to wear a mask. She informed me he (my overtired two year old son) would need to comply with their company policy or we would be asked to leave the aircraft,' she wrote.

'I continued trying to get him to wear the mask, bawling my eyes out and hyperventilating behind my own suffocating mask,' Davis explained in the posting which has received almost 200,000 likes.   

But the crew would not take no for an answer and ultimately the captain had the final say deciding that she and her son would have to get off the plane. 

Video footage showed Davis and her son in the gate area pleading with staff to let them back

'Rather than get themselves any bad press by escorting a crying mom and two year old off the plane, they forced everyone to deplane, and wouldn’t let us back on the flight home. Apparently before we got off the plane everyone who left before us lit up the crew in the gate area,' David wrote.

'The Captain walking right by me as I screamed my head off in my absolute worst moment.

'Desperate to get home after the worst week. He would have been asleep before we even pushed back if they had just been humans,' she noted.   

'This is the world we live in?' Davis' post ends. 

Davis could be seen in tears as American Airlines staff members were unable to provide a solution. She ended up having to be rebooked on a later flight 

Rachel Davis, pictured together with her son, Lyon, had taken three other AA flights that week and had not been asked to wear face masks on any of the other journeys

Video footage shot by a fellow passenger shows Davis yelling at a member of American Airlines staff as she despairs with the situation.

'What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do?' she can be heard asking. 'You don't know? Because there is nothing to be done - he is two years old for God's sake!'

'He is two-years-old. He doesn't get it. We have been on four American Airlines flights and not one of them have asked him to wear a mask.' 

American Airlines says it requires all persons two years and older to wear an appropriate face covering throughout the entirety of their journey

American Airlines has released a statement over the incident in which it explained its mask policy.

'To ensure the safety of our customers and team, American Airlines requires all persons 2 years and older to wear an appropriate face covering throughout the entirety of their journey. Policies are enforced and approved face coverings are made available at key points throughout the customer journey. We've reached out to the family to learn more about their recent travel experience and to address their concerns.' 

Guidance from the CDC advises children aged two and older to wear a mask in public years of age and older should wear a mask in public and when around other people they don’t live with.
