A musician at a prestigious drama college raped a woman after a night out, a court heard.

Benjamin Williams-Stacey, 25, is accused of raping the young woman after she passed out at a student party.

He allegedly 'took advantage' after she fell asleep on his sofa at his student home, Cardiff Crown Court heard. 

Williams-Stacey is studying at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama - the former college of stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, Rob Brydon and Ruth Jones. 

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said the young woman had drunk seven to eight pints of lager throughout the night, had been among those smoking cannabis in the garden and described herself as being 'extremely drunk'.

Mr Griffiths said she came from the garden and lay on the sofa to fall asleep.

But the court heard she woke when a man moved her legs apart, pushed her underwear to one side and raped her.

Mr Griffiths said: 'The episode lasted for five minutes and the male did not say anything.'

Describing the alleged incident in her video interview, the complainant said she 'just lay still' during the incident.

When asked the reason why she didn't say anything during the incident, she said: 'I was scared, I just wanted it to be over.'

Williams-Stacey was arrested and positive DNA test match was made.

In his police interview Williams-Stacey said he was seven or eight out of ten in terms of intoxication at the start of the night.

After smoking cannabis in the garden at his home he described himself being ten out of ten in intoxication and 'in the worst state he had ever been in'.

He said he remembered being alone with the complainant when she was asleep on the couch in the living room. But he could not remember any more.

The music student, from Roath, attended lectures in the morning but was made aware of the allegation and was subsequently arrested when he returned home.

Williams-Stacey denies rape and the trial continues.
