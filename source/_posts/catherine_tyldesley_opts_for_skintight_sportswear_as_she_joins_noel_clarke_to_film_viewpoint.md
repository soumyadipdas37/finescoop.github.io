Alexandra showcased a more quirky ensemble as she sported a denim flared jumpsuit with a brown velvet blazer and 70s-inspired blue leather ankle boots. 

A couple of nights before, Catherine appeared to be in the midst of an emotional scene as she wore a downcast expression whilst filming in front of a candle-lit vigil with Dominic Allburn and their co-stars.

The series is headed up by Fleabag director Harry Bradbeer, and sees DC Martin King (played by Noel) set up his observation post in the home of single mother and secret voyeur, Zoe Sterling, played by Alexandra.

Back to work: The crew all donned protective face masks to prepare the cast for filming

Setting the bar: Viewpoint was one of the first TV dramas to begin filming after the TV industry was brought to a halt by the COVID-19 pandemic
