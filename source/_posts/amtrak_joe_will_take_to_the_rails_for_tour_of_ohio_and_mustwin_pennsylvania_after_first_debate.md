Democratic nominee Joe Biden will embark on a seven-stop train tour through the swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania Wednesday on the heels of the first presidential debate.  

Biden and his wife Jill will kick off the tour Wednesday morning in Cleveland, the debate locale, and make a mid-day stop in Alliance, Ohio before choo choo-ing through Western Pennsylvania. 

The ex-vice president will hold a handful of train station events and end the day doing a 'drive-in' event that is invite-only, as the Biden campaign refuses to flout coronavirus restrictions like President Donald Trump, who's restarted holding large rallies. 

Democrat Joe Biden will take the train through Ohio and Pennsylvania Wednesday on the heels of the first presidential debate against President Donald Trump 

Biden has been known for years as 'Amtrak Joe' in part because he commuted to Washington, D.C. every day from Wilmington, Delaware on Amtrak. Here's Biden while serving in the U.S. Senate in 1988 

Joe Biden took an Amtrak train out of Wilmington immediately after announcing his first of three presidential bids in June 1987. He's photographed with (from left) Hunter, Jill, Ashley and Beau 

Joe Biden is photographed on January 17, 2009, when he and President-elect Barack Obama traveled on Amtrak from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. 

In 2008, Joe Biden is photographed mingling with passengers on the Amtrak Acela when he was running for vice president of the United States 

For years, Biden's nickname has been 'Amtrak Joe,' and the Amtrak station in his adopted hometown of Wilmington, Delaware has been named after him. 

After his first wife and baby daughter died after he was elected to the U.S. Senate at the age of 29, Biden decided to commute to Washington, D.C. daily via Amtrak, as a single parent to sons Beau and Hunter. 

For Biden that was a daily three-hour trip. 

During this summer's Democratic National Convention, the Biden campaign played up the former vice president's working class roots by having Amtrak employees discuss how down-to-earth the longtime train-rider is. 

And on the campaign trail, Biden shared many times how he and former President Barack Obama took Amtrak between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. in 2009 three days before the president-elect was sworn in.  

He also kicked off his first run for president, back in 1987, riding an Amtrak.  

The Biden campaign did not respond to DailyMail.com's query on whether the Democratic nominee would technically be taking an 'Amtrak' train for his voyage Wednesday - though he's stopping at a number of stations the passenger service utilizes.  

In Pennsylvania, Biden's first stop will be in Pittsburgh, a solidly Democratic city. 

From there, the train travels through both Westmoreland and then Cambria counties, which have seen major Republican gains since the ex-vice president was first on the ticket with President Barack Obama in 2008. 

Westmoreland has been the more traditionally Republican of the two - despite the western side of the country housing Pittsburgh suburbs. 

In 2008, GOP nominee, Sen. John McCain, received 58 per cent of the Westmoreland County vote, to Obama-Biden's 41 per cent. 

Four years later, Romney pulled 61.3 per cent of that county's vote to Obama's 37.6 per cent. 

And then, in 2016, Westmoreland County went for Trump 64.1 per cent to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's 32.7 per cent.     

Biden will make stops in Greensburg, Westmoreland County's county seat, New Alexandria and then take the train into Latobe, Pennsylvania - the home of Arnold Palmer and Mr. Rogers - where the president held a packed rally earlier this month at the regional airport.  

The Democratic nominee then concludes the day in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the largest city in Cambria County. 

For years, Johnstown was associated with its powerful Democratic congressman, the late Rep. Jack Murtha. 

And in 2008, while Murtha was still alive, Cambria County went to the Obama-Biden ticket 50 per cent to 48 per cent. 

Four years later, there was a 10-point swing in the country with Romney getting 58 per cent of the vote and Obama earning 40.2 per cent.   

And Trump nearly got the county to swing another full 10 points in Republicans' direction. 

In 2016 he won Cambria Country with 67.3 per cent of the vote, compared to the 29.6 per cent won by Clinton.  

The latest polling shows Biden - a native of Scranton, located in the eastern part of the state - ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania. 

The Real Clear Politics polling average has the Democrat 5.7 points ahead of the Republican incumbent.    

If Biden expects to win the state, he'll need to beat back some of the GOP gains in Western Pennsylvania over the past 12 years.
