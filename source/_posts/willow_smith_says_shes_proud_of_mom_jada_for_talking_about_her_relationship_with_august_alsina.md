Jada Pinkett Smith made waves this summer when she opened up about having a romantic relationship with rapper August Alsina while married to Will Smith.

And on the actress' latest episode of Red Table Talk, her daughter Willow, 19, expressed her admiration for Jada's decision to publicly talk about the affair, with Will sitting by her side.

'I want to put it on the table. I'm so proud of you. To be able to see you and Dad do that, for me, that was like, "OK, that's the real deal. That's real love."' Willow said.

'OK, that's the real deal. That's real love.' Willow Smith said she was proud of mom Jada for opening up about her relationship with August Alsina and her marriage to Will Smith

'Like, when you can be like, "I'm with you. I'm going to stand by you and I'm going to hold your hand"... that's really important,' the singer said.

During the episode, Jada, 49, described the moment she broke her silence about the romance as 'a full blast of, like, flaws, and feeling and just the total breakdown of any mask.'

Jada addressed her relationship with 28-year-old August after he claimed during an interview with Angela Yee that he had an affair with the Girls Trip star after getting the 'blessing' of her husband Will.

Soon after Jada and Will appeared on an episode of Red Table Talk to admit Jada had been in a relationship with August despite originally denying the rumors, but they both maintained that Will never gave August his blessing, because he was actually separated from Jada at the time.

August responded again to say he doesn’t 'have an issue' with Jada or Will, as he still sees them as 'family'. 

Speaking to Vulture, he said: 'I don’t have an issue with anybody. I love everybody. I love all of them. They've been my family, and there's a lot of history there.

'They're beautiful people. They're beautiful spirits. They really are. There's no bad blood with anybody. They [the Smiths] got [the Angela Yee interview] way before the world ever saw it. It came from a loving place. There's no bad love with anybody. I got love for everybody on this planet.'

August's claims forced Jada and Will to admit they had endured a brief split in their 23-year marriage, which they discussed on Jada's Facebook Watch show. 

Speaking to Jada, Will said on the show: 'I was done with you. We decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I'll try to figure out myself happy. I really felt like we could be over.'

And Jada added: 'We were over.'

The actress admitted she 'got into a different kind of entanglement' with August, but maintained that Will, 51, never gave the rapper his 'blessing' for the romance to take place. 

Jada said: 'It was a relationship. I was in a lot of pain, I was very broken. In the process of that relationship, I definitely realized that you can't find happiness outside of yourself. 

Jada said: 'It was a relationship. I was in a lot of pain, I was very broken. In the process of that relationship, I definitely realized that you can't find happiness outside of yourself.'

'Luckily enough, you and I were also going through a process in a much different matter. I would definitely say we did everything that we could to get away from each other, only to realize that that wasn't possible. 

'I just wanted to feel good. It had been so long since I felt good. It was really a joy to help heal somebody.'

When Will and Jada began communicating again, Jada claimed August ended their relationship.
