The Graham Norton Show has confirmed it will return next month after undergoing a Covid-friendly shake-up. 

The BBC chat show will see the eponymous host and several of his famous guests back at the BBC Television Centre in West London, and the return of a live audience. 

However, some celebrity guests will connect remotely via video call, and for those in the studio, the famous sofa will be replaced by individual chairs positioned at a distance.

The new series will feature a smaller audience in order to allow social distancing, but they will be able to have a go on the Big Red Chair, which is also returning.  

The last series of the chat show aired amid the coronavirus lockdown, with episodes being reduced to 30 minutes and screened earlier in the evening. 

The programme was presented by Graham from his own home chatting to guests via video link.

The BBC said at the time that it was determined to continue airing the show in a bid to keep Britons entertained amid the health crisis.

Speaking in March, Tony Hall, the former director general, explained: 'The BBC is determined to do all it can to raise a smile and keep the country entertained during these testing times. 

'We have lots of great shows already recorded, but we have also found ways to keep many other shows going so that the familiar faces people love will still be in their living rooms in the weeks and months ahead.' 

The Graham Norton Show returns on Friday October 2 at 10.45pm on BBC One
