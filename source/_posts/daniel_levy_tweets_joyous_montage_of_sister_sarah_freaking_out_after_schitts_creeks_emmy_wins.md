This year's Emmys made history for several reasons, not the least of which was Schitt's Creek sweeping all the major comedy categories for which it was nominated.

And the morning after Sunday's virtual festivities, actor, writer, producer and director Daniel Levy tweeted a positively joyous video of his sister Sarah reacting to the Emmy Awards telecast, during which she yelped with glee after each of the series' unprecedented wins.

In the video, 34-year-old Sarah is seen at home in front of the television, leaping, kneeling and doing hot feet for joy, repeatedly yelling 'oh my god' happily.

With each win for the Pop TV show, which included all four top comedy acting trophies for her dad and brother, as well as Catherine O'Hara and Annie Murphy, Sarah grows more and more excited, also turning to react in front of her laptop.

At the end of the clip, which was filmed by her fiance Graham Outerbridge, Sarah can be heard saying 'I literally only have "Oh my god" in my vocabulary!' 

Dan captioned the video, 'Last night happened so that this montage of my sister's reactions could exist. Love you, @sarahlevy_. Wish you could have been there with us...but this is almost better? Thanks for capturing it @outerbridge_g.'

By sweeping the acting categories as well as Outstanding Writing, Directing and Series, Schitt's Creek made history on Sunday night as the most awarded comedy ever in a single year.

The Canadian sitcom, about a family of out-of-touch rich folk who end up waylaid in a podunk country town, also picked up statuettes for Outstanding Casting as well as Costumes.

Creek was very much a family affair, as the show not only featured Dan and his comic veteran actor father Eugene, but also included sister Sarah as series repeat Twyla Sands throughout the show's run.

The irreverent show steadily gained in popularity thanks to word-of-mouth and a growing fanbase throughout its six-season run, helped in no small part by its inclusion on the Netflix slate starting in Season 3.

The show ended this April with a surprisingly heartfelt conclusion.

That series finale episode in particular, titled Happy Ending, earned three of the Emmys on Sunday night, for writing, directing and costumes.
