Elle Fanning revealed she was 'made fun of' as a schoolgirl for her 'crazy outfits' and 'eccentric' style 'but I didn't care.'

The 22-year-old has established a reputation as both an acclaimed actress and a fashion plate amid her rise to stardom.

Covering the 15th anniversary issue of C magazine she dished about her childhood dress sense: 'When I was young, I was allowed to be eccentric.'

The sister of Dakota Fanning shared: 'My mom would let me put on crazy outfits and go to school. I think I had an appetite for it more than Dakota did.'

Elle dished: 'There are things that I would wear, and she would say: "That looks insane." Kids definitely made fun of me, but I didn’t care.'

As for her current style: 'I’m not usually the T-shirt and jeans type of girl. But I have a Gucci sweater that I can wear over it and Chanel loafers, so that’s OK.'

Her clothing hit the headlines last year when she fainted at Cannes and revealed it was because of her 'time of the month' along with how tight her Prada dress was.

She can also be seen in a string of extravagant ensembles on her new darkly comic Hulu show The Great which she leads as Russian Empress Catherine II.

The series was created by Tony McNamara, co-writer of the similarly acid-tongued historical comedy The Favourite, who thought of Elle in the part.

She was similarly enthusiastic about his work saying when she read the script: 'I just found it bonkers and incredible. It was so special. Tony’s writing is so against sappy or cliche. He’s very dry. We’ll have this romantic scene and snot will be coming out of Catherine’s nose. It’s with a bit of a wink.'

Elle has also said she would love to do a project with The Favourite director Yorgos Lanthimos as well as with the Safdie brothers of Uncut Gems fame.

Season one of The Great follows Catherine's marriage to Tsar Peter III (Nicholas Hoult) leading up to her coup against him.

After his forced abdication Peter III was packed off to Ropsha where he was eventually apparently assassinated.

His death was officially attributed to 'hemorrhoidal colic,' which historian Simon Sebag Montefiore wrote became 'a humorous euphemism for political murder.'

She and Dakota are starring in an upcoming movie called The Nightingale in which they will play estranged sisters navigating the dangers of life in Vichy France.

Although it was originally slated for release this year the coronavirus pandemic has caused it to be bumped to December 2021.

The director is French film star Melanie Laurent, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie Inglourious Basterds also about the Nazi occupation of her country.

This is also not the first time Elle has worked with her sister - she made her film debut as a younger version of Dakota's character in the 2001 drama I Am Sam.
