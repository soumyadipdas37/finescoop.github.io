Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand is delighted by the possibility of the club signing Donny van de Beek after welcoming the Ajax star ahead of his £40million move to Old Trafford. 

Ferdinand tweeted his excitement ahead of the 23-year-old's impending switch, and his former Red Devils team-mate Edwin van der Sar - now CEO of the Dutch outfit - suggested the deal was close to completion after responding with a sad emoji.

Ferdinand tweeted: 'Good Evening @Donny_beek6', and included an emoji of a pair of eyes after news the midfielder was edging closer to completing his deal.

And former United goalkeeper Van der Sar responded to the speculation by hinting at his despair with the Eredivisie side set to lose another key star, as he replied to the post with a crying face.

Van der Sar and Ferdinand played together under Sir Alex Ferguson for six years in a hugely successful spell - winning four Premier League titles.

Van de Beek was due to link up with the Holland national team this week ahead of Nations League games against Poland and Italy, but has delayed his arrival in order to complete his United medical.

He is set to receive a significant upgrade on his current £30,000-a-week wages as he prepares to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men for the 2020-21 season.

His father has also added fuel to speculation the deal is nearing completion.

'This is a dream come true. It's the perfect moment for him to make this step to such a beautiful club,' he said. 'Many clubs were interested, but Donny took this decision himself.'

Tottenham reportedly made a last-ditch attempt to sign Van de Beek, but he was eager to join United after being convinced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

The player was in high demand this summer after an impressive season with the Dutch giants - scoring 14 goals from midfield and providing seven assists.
