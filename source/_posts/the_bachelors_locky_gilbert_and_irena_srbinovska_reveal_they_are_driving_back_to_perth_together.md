The cat was finally out of the bag on Thursday night when Locky Gilbert picked Irena Srbinovska as his winner on The Bachelor.

And the happy couple has now revealed they are planning to enjoy a road-trip in New South Wales before making the long drive back to Perth to move in together.

'We just want to be together,' 30-year-old Locky gushingly told The Wash before Irena added their plans for the foreseeable future involved them being 'on the road'.

'Obviously, we've got out future plans, but right now we just want some alone time,' Locky told the publication. 

The pair will most likely have to apply for an exemption to enter Western Australia due to the State's strict COVID-19 border restrictions.

They will then have to quarantine for two weeks at home before being able to travel freely within the State.

On Friday night, Irena explained that they are planning to live together in the same city.

'The plan is that I'm moving over to Perth,' a smiling Irena revealed on The Project. 

During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella Varelis and Irena that he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.

After an emotional break-up with Bella, Locky composed himself and then professed his love for Irena, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.

In a new interview with Who magazine, the happy couple revealed the codenames they used to communicate with each other while the show was airing.

'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky admitted, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.

'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.

'Douglas is Locky's middle name so that's where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.
