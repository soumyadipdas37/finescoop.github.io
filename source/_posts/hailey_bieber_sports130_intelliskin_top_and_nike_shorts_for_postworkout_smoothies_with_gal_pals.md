The Biebers are gearing up to celebrate their official second wedding anniversary on September 30 following an informal picnic on September 13 to celebrate the day they got their marriage license in New York.

The Christian couple - who met at the 26-year-old pop star's 2009 concert meet-and-greet - are now moving into the $25.8M seven-bedroom Beverly Park mansion they bought in August.

Last Friday, Justin debuted the wholesome music video for his new song Holy featuring Chance The Rapper, which references his whirlwind romance with Hailey.Â

'Running to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy,' Bieber sang.

'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.'

In the Colin Tilley-directed video - which has amassed 27M views on YouTube - the Canadian crooner and Ryan Destiny play a couple that lose their home and are offered a warm meal by a soldier (Wilmer Valderrama).
