An elderly woman has been critically injured after she was mowed over by a driver on a Revel scooter in Manhattan on Tuesday morning. 

The driver - an unidentified male - did not leave the scene after hitting the 82-year-old woman in Columbus Circle, CBS New York reports. No charges have been filed against the man, so far.

According to food truck worker Khaled Osman, who witnessed the incident, the scene was nothing short of sad.

'The guy who hurt her was a gentleman. He was standing there, you know, feeling sorry and at the same time he's helpless. And I know it was a big shock for him, too,' Osman explained. 

Osman added that several bystanders tried to help the woman but were nervous to touch her.   

The NYPD shared that the incident happened at around 7.30am, adding that the driver had been driving south on Broadway at 60th Street when he hit the woman at the intersection.

Police have not yet charged the man in connection to the incident 

It is currently unknown who had the right away at the time.  

The NYPD released video showing moments after the crash, with the scooter sitting out in the street. 

Revel had to temporarily shut down over the summer, after three people died. 

Several people involved in crashes, including CBS2 reporter Nina Kapur, had not been wearing helmets. Revel introduced new safety protocols, including require users to take a selfie with their helmets on.

Revel released a statement saying that they were investigating the incident.   

'We are aware of reports of an accident this morning in New York City. An investigation is underway, and we're actively working alongside local officials to confirm the circumstances of the incident,' the spokesperson said.
