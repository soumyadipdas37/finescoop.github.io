Rolf Harris, 90, pictured for the first time since his lockdown birthday

Paedophile Rolf Harris has been seen in public for the first time since he turned 90 during the coronavirus lockdown.

The disgraced entertainer was spotted taking his dog for a walk in Bray in Berkshire.

Harris was seen carrying a wooden walking stick with him as he took his dog for a stroll.

Wearing a blue shirt, green vest, beige trousers and sandals for his outing, Harris looked a frail figure.

The 90-year-old lives with his wife Alwen Hughes at their home in Berkshire where he has been placed under 'house arrest' by his family following a 'disastrous incident'.

Last year, Harris entered the grounds of  Oldfield Primary School and waved at pupils.

Richard Jarrett, head of Oldfield Primary School, said Harris had no access to the pupils and ordered him off the grounds before informing the police.

But neighbours at the time defended him, saying: 'He's an asset to the area, he's been a tremendous supporter of any charity we've been part of.'

Another said the incident had an adverse effect on his health, saying: 'It's badly affected him; he's in poor health and has declined rapidly. He doesn't come out any more and when he does it's only ever with his carer.'

Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults at Southwark Crown Court in June 2014, and was sentenced to six years behind bars.

The assaults include one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend of over 16 years.

Some of the offences had been carried out while his daughter was in the same room. He admitted having a relationship with the woman, but said it only started when she reached 18. 

However, he was released from HMP Stafford on parole in May 2017 after serving just three years of his sentence. 

During his time behind bars he was hospitalised after his diabetes spiralled out of control. 

Of the 12 convictions, one was overturned on appeal in November 2017, and a jury chose not to convict him in two additional cases in the same year.
