The Wanted singer Max George has reportedly signed up to Strictly Come Dancing and 'joins' stars Bill Bailey and Caroline Quentin for the upcoming series in October. 

The hit BBC One dance show is said to be thrilled to have a 'hunk' as part of the line-up and hopes that Max, 31, will 'bring in a younger audience to the show'. 

It comes after Max's former bandmate Jay McGuiness, 30, danced his way to the top in 2015 and won the contest with his professional partner Aliona Vilani.

A source told The Sun: 'It’s great for the show to have a hunk already secured to take part and given his time singing they’re hoping he has good dancing feet.' 

The All Time Low hitmaker will also have the support of his girlfriend Stacey Giggs, 41, who is the ex-wife of the former Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs.  

Earlier this year, Max's former fianceé Michelle Keegan, 33, is said to have ruled out taking part in the show.

MailOnline has contacted Max's representatives for comment.  

It comes after the BBC is said to be 'delighted' over signing the Have I Got News For You star Bill Bailey, 55, and Men Behaving Badly actress Caroline Quentin, 60.

The professional dancers were spotted arriving at the hotel where they will reportedly isolate for a fortnight to learn group routines earlier this week amid the Covid-19 crisis.

A source told The Sun: 'The BBC are delighted with the double signing. Caroline is looking forward to the challenge and wants to get properly stuck in.

'And it’s a hard time for live performers so it seemed a good chance for Bill to commit to the show.'

A Strictly Come Dancing representative told MailOnline: 'We don’t comment on speculation. The line up will be announced in due course.'   

According to the publication, Caroline has wanted to be part of Strictly for years but always had other work commitments.

Whereas in 2018 Bill revealed that he has been asked to do the dancing series several times but was put off by the 'judgemental' nature of the show.

He said on The Graham Norton show: 'I've been asked a couple of times. I like the idea of the dancing but it is so judgemental, which isn't for me. 

'I'd like to learn to dance without the critique. It's pretty harsh and withering.'

The newspaper reports that Bill has now changed his mind due to several of his work commitments being cancelled amid the Covid-19 crisis.   

Famous roles: Caroline has established a successful career from the likes of TV shows Men Behaving Badly (pictured with co-star Martin Clunes) and Jonathan Creek 

Fame: Bill is best known for the shows Have I Got News For You, QI and Never Mind The Buzzcocks

Fans have been awaiting the return of Strictly Come Dancing amid uncertainty of its future due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier this week, the professional dancers were spotted arriving at the hotel where they will reportedly isolate for a fortnight to learn group routines amid pandemic. 

As the professional dancers arrived at their secret hotel, BBC director of content Charlotte Moore spoke at the Edinburgh TV Festival.

She confirmed that Strictly was 'absolutely coming back' and the celebrity line-up will be be confirmed at the end of the month. 

Charlotte added that it will be a 'special series' this year with a shorter run, and that due to the current circumstances 'the dances will have real poignancy.'

Strictly Come Dancing told MailOnline: 'As we continue to follow the latest guidance from Public Health England and industry guidelines, we are considering isolating the dancers and key production members to enable our much-loved group numbers to continue. 

'We're incredibly proud of our professional dancers for their dedication to the show and their commitment to showcasing their love of dance to the nation.

'The safety of our cast and crew is of the utmost importance to us and further updates will be made in due course.' 

This year's Strictly is set to start in October instead of the usual start in early September and will be several weeks shorter than normal. 

Distanced: The judge will make remote appearances from his home for the Sunday night results shows at the beginning of this series, due to travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19

Earlier this month it was reported that show executives are 'devising 100 different formats' to align with current guidelines as filming prepares to take place in Elstree Studios for a start date of October 24.

The restrictions include putting a limit on the amount of people allowed on set, as well as excluding 'chemistry circles' in auditions, which sees contestants alternate in 'sexy' dances with professionals so producers can decide 'who look good together'.

A BBC source told The Sun: 'Preparing for this year's show is a huge headache. The goalposts keep moving, so the big decisions are being left to the last minute so we're as up to date as possible.  

'But any concrete things we can decide on now, we are doing. Making one hit series is hard enough. As things stand, we are having to plan for hundreds. 

'The slightest change to the rules could have a massive impact on how the show is filmed. Many [celebs] are weighing up their options, so Strictly still doesn't have a full line-up.' 

He'll be back! Bosses also confirmed that they hope Bruno can return to the Strictly studio for the end of the series in December

The insider claimed the competition will be held in a near-empty, no-audience studio with a scaled-back crew consisting of only 25 per cent of the usual team for the first time in the show's 16-year history.

Another aspect of the series that is believed to have changed is the partnering process, which could be decided on height alone as opposed to the celebs performing salsa dances in a circle with all ballroom experts. 

It's also been reported that BBC bosses have scrapped plans for celebrities and professional dancers to isolate together. 

In a last minute change of plan, the couples will instead be in a 'bubble' system and there will be regular testing ahead of the live shows, The Sun reports.

However, the dancers are still said to be isolating together this month so that they can pre-record group routines. 

A TV source told the publication: 'The idea of holing sexy dancers up with celebrities made it impossible to sign anybody up.'  

It comes after judge Bruno Tonioli, 64, has confirmed he won't be appearing on the judging panel this series. 

Bosses confirmed that the judge will make remote appearances from his home for the Sunday night results shows at the beginning of this series, as he is unable to travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

But fans need not fear as bosses vowed they hope to have Bruno back in the studio towards the end of the series, alongside judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Shirley Ballas.

Executive producer Sarah James said: 'I'm overjoyed that we've found a way for Bruno to be part of this year's Strictly. 

Back and forth: It was previously reported that Bruno wouldn't be able to travel to the UK due to his work commitments on US series Dancing with the Stars  

'His passion and enthusiasm are such a big part of the show, I'm thrilled we can continue to deliver that to audiences this year.'

Bruno added: 'I absolutely adore being part of Strictly and can't wait to see what incredible dancing this year has in store! 

'Lockdown has resulted in me being in LA for the foreseeable, but I'm excited to be involved as much as I possibly can. There was no cha-cha-chance I'd miss out!' 

It was previously reported that Bruno could make a comeback to Strictly later this year after being unable to appear due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The judge usually jets between London and Los Angeles to sit on the panel for both the long-running UK show as well as its US counterpart Dancing With The Stars.

But due to the global coronavirus pandemic impacting travel restrictions it was reported that the Italian choreographer had favoured the US version when forced to pick just one of the shows. 

Sources added that bosses were hopeful that Bruno could make an in-person appearance for the grand final in December. 

A source told The Daily Star: 'Travel restrictions in place because of coronavirus meant he couldn't fly back and forth to do both shows this year, so he picked Dancing With The Stars. 

'But Strictly's producers were still keen for him to make an appearance if it was possible.' 

The source added: 'Dancing With The Stars usually ends a few weeks before Strictly's final. So the plan is for Bruno to jet back to the UK as soon as he's finished with his ­commitments in the US.  

Plans: Earlier this month it was reported that executives are 'devising 100 different formats' to align with guidelines as filming prepares to take place in Elstree for a start date of October 24

MailOnline contacted Bruno's representatives for comment at the time.

The news also came after fellow Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood, who has appeared on the show alongside Bruno since 2004, said he was confident the choreographer would make a 'triumphant return' in 2021.

He said: 'They might throw guest judges in for fun. Then when everything's back to normal, Bruno can make his triumphant return!'

In recent weeks, various big-name stars have been mentioned as a possible replacement for Bruno including Cheryl.

But Craig said he doubted whether the pop star would appear on the upcoming series, saying: 'Lovely girl, but I don't think it will happen.' 

It comes after Strictly Come Dancing bosses denied celebrities such as Michelle Keegan and Jessie J declined to be on the show this year because of the 'low' £60,000 appearance fee. 

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline on Wednesday, a Strictly source has contested reports that several celebrities had turned them down and said only those who have signed onto the show were offered a fee.

The source explained: 'Everyone we have offered a fee to this year have been confirmed as part of the line up, so nobody has declined appearing in the show after we've begun negotiations.'
