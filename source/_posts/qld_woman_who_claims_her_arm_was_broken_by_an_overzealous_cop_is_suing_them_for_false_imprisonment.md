A young woman who accused a police officer of breaking her arm during a routine arrest is suing for damages.

Madison Holt, 22, claims she was dragged from a home in Taranganba, west of Rockhampton in Queensland, to be questioned over a stolen cell phone in February 2019.

She claimed she was being restrained by detective Alex Nesic Detective Sergeant Craig Strohfeldt when Nesic allegedly punched the top of her left arm. 

She alleged she heard a 'loud cracking noise' and began yelling that her arm was broken.

In a claim filed in Brisbane District Court, Ms Holt alleged police used unreasonable force during the arrest because they didn't have reasonable grounds to suspect she had broken the law, the Courier Mail reported.

Ms Holt is seeking an unspecified amount in compensation for losing her liberty between 4pm and 4.10pm on the day of the incident, claiming she suffered pain, mental distress and anguish. 

She claims the two detectives were 'overzealous, intrusive, unwarranted and manifestly excessive'.

Ms Holt has previously claimed she yelled 'I'm not resisting' three times during the arrest. 

She claims she was 'grabbed roughly' by the officers and forced to bend over some railings as one of the detectives held her arms behind her back.

She alleges the detective then punched her in the arm.

Ms Holt claims she then heard a loud crack and began yelling that her arm was broken.

'(He) was saying 'f***, f***, f***,'' and yelled at Detective (name withheld) 'stop, I've broken her arm'.

She was rushed to Rockhampton Hospital and treated for a fractured arm.

Ms Holt was not been charged for any crimes. 

She had called for the two detectives to face charges for the arrest but following an internal investigation by the Queensland Police Service it was decided neither would face charges.
