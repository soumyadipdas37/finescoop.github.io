She's long been known for her eye-catching style choices.

And Helena Bonham Carter was once again displaying her kooky fashion sense as she headed out for a stroll in north London.

The Crown star, 54, opted for a velvet trench coat and a mixed-print scarf as she grappled with her glasses during the outing.

Helena showed off her funky style choices by opting for a loose black velvet trench coat, teamed with a matching dress and chunky boots.

The actress finished her outfit with a colourful scarf that boasted a mixture of prints as she chatted to a male pal.

During the walk Helen struggled with adjusting her glasses as she chatted to a male pal.

In recent months Helena has been in a relationship with boyfriend Rye Dag Holmboe 32, and she said in late 2019 that their romance has been 'a bit of unexpected magic in my life.'

Helena shares son Billy, 16, and 12-year-old daughter Nell with her ex Tim Burton, 62.

The Cinderella star had a famously unconventional 13-year relationship with director Tim, which ended in 2014.

On finally moving on from Tim, the Enid star – who previously dated Irish actor Kenneth Branagh between 1994 and 1999 – admitted she grew tired of 'grieving' their relationship, and now leads a 'happy' life with her new boyfriend.

Speaking to Harper's Bazaar UK, the thespian shared: 'You break up, you grieve, you get bored of grieving. And then you finally move on.

'I'm very happy with someone else. It's been a bit of unexpected magic in my life.'
