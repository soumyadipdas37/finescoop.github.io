Nicky Whelan is known for her sensational bikini body.

And on Monday, the former Neighbours actress proudly flaunted her trim and toned figure as she vacationed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with her actress pal Kate Neilson. 

The 39-year-old showcased her slender frame in an orange halterneck bikini top that clashed with her blue bottoms.

She accessorised her look with a pair of oversized orange sunglasses and styled her blonde pixie cut swept to the side.

Nicky adjusted her bottoms as she prepared to lounge on the day bed and work on her tan alongside friend Kate, who wore a multi-coloured bikini. 

After their sun bathing session, Nicky happily captured a photo of bikini-clad Kate before going on a walk.

After lapping up the sun and the sea breeze, Nicky and Katie headed back to their seaside hotel.

Holiday: It seemed like the friends had the beach all to themselves as the beach appeared to barely any other visitors

They sat at a table under the shade by the beach and enjoyed an animated conversation with drinks.

Nicky's relaxing day by the beach comes after recently set hearts racing with a raunchy bikini photo on Friday from her Mexico holiday. 

Last week, she stripped down to a skimpy orange two-piece that showcased her gym-honed physique as she made her way down to the beach.

'The lovely private beach at Hotelito Mio,' she captioned the post.

The blonde bombshell isn't shy about showing off her amazing physique, as she regularly takes to Instagram to flaunt her frame in bikinis or activewear.

In November last year, she spoke about her diet and exercise regime to Muscle and Fitness while training for the action series Matador.

'As for diet, I eat small meals all day. I start every day with a green shake in my blender, then follow that with coffee'.

The Left Behind star explained she 'changes up her training' but likes to keep a 'healthy, happy mind'.
