She's the fashion blogger and tanning mogul known for her blonde hair and golden skin.

But Elle Ferguson may be unrecognisable to even her most loyal Instagram followers following a dramatic hair makeover,

As part of a promotional event to celebrate the classic sitcom Friends arriving on streaming service Binge, the 32-year-old attempted to recreate Jennifer Aniston's iconic '90s hairdo.

Before and after: Fashion blogger Elle Ferguson dyed her hair brunette for a promotional event this week 

Elle dubbed her take on the hairstyle the 'RachElle' - a reference to Aniston's character Rachel Green and her own name.

Created by celebrity hairdresser Travis Balcke, the RachElle is a modern take on the classic hairstyle that features a fuller brunette colour, is slightly longer in length and achieves more refined and polished layering.

With over 680,000 Instagram followers, Elle has fast become a top fashion and lifestyle influencer in recent years.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia earlier thos year, the founder of Elle Effect revealed the one beauty product she simply can't go without while in isolation.

'A tan is a non-negotiable for me. I feel better mentally and physically when I have a tan,' she said.

Elle admitted that while she's enjoying 'not having to wear makeup every day', she's been using the time to try out new looks.

'I am literally trying every product I have in my makeup and skincare drawer. It's so much fun as I never usually have this time to play.

'I'm really enjoying all the makeup and hair tutorials – either creating my own or doing other people's,' she said.

Elle, who is engaged to former AFL player Joel Patfull, also revealed exercise has been keeping the couple sane while in isolation.

'I am very blessed to live with a professional athlete, so Joel and I invested in a treadmill when the lockdown began and it's been keeping us both sane,' she said.

'We have been setting ourselves challenges everyday. It's hard but it's so rewarding, particularly as I've really only just started running recently.'
