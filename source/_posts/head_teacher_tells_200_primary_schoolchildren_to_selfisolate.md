Around 200 students at a primary school in Somerset have been told to self-isolate after three members of staff tested positive for Covid-19. 

Head teacher Marie Berry asked students 'in a number of classes' to remain at home from today after meeting with Public Health England to discuss the confirmed cases.

Bournville Primary School in Weston-super-Mare sent a text to parents of children in the affected year groups last night, asking those in years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 to self-isolate.

Alongside the 200 students being asked to remain home, around 30 employees at the school have also been asked to stay away from work. 

The school will remain open for the further 300 pupils who are enrolled, and deep cleaning has been undertaken to ensure there is no risk of surface transmission.

In a statement, Ms Berry said: 'We are working alongside Public Health England and North Somerset Council to ensure the continued safety and wellbeing of our pupils and staff.

'In line with government guideline we have taken all the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

'We are confident that we have tracked all those who have been in contact with the positive cases and have followed all recommendations from Public Health England.

'We thank the whole community of Bournville for their ongoing support doing this difficult time.'

She added in a notice on the school's website that parents would receive a 'detailed letter' today explaining when the isolation period should stop.  

There are currently 1,076 confirmed cases of coronavirus in North Somerset, where a further seven infections were reported yesterday. 

Matt Lenny, director of public health at North Somerset Council said: 'The school has acted promptly and efficiently in order to ensure that the onward spread of infection is controlled. 

'We have been working closely to ensure that effective infection control measures are in place.

'The school are doing all they can to keep parents and pupils updated at this difficult time.

'As the number of cases across the country is rising we all need to play our part to halt the spread of the virus.

'Everyone, regardless of their age or state of health, must continue to practise good hand hygiene, wear a face mask when needed, maintain social distancing of two metres wherever possible and self-isolate and book a test if they experience any of the symptoms of the virus.

'Anyone who has symptoms but is struggling to access a test should self isolate at home until they are able to do so.'
