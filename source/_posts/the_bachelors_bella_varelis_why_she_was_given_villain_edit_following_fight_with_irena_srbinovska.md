Her soured friendship with Irena Srbinovska is at the point of no return.

And The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has now revealed that producers gave her the unfavourable villain edit because they were desperate for Locky Gilbert's winner Irena to look good.

Speaking on the Shameless podcast, the 25-year-old explained: 'They're not going to make the person he ended up with look bad. I guess I had to cop the brunt of that'.

'I have to cop the brunt': The Bachelor's Bella Varelis [pictured] has now revealed that producers gave her the unfavourable villain edit because they were desperate for Locky Gilbert's winner Irena Srbinovska to look good

Bella's comments on the negative editing she received came after she explained that there was a lot that viewers didn't see during her fight with former friend, Irena.

'People on social media tell me, "you can't blame the edit, those things came out of your mouth!"

'Well, no. What you're not seeing are the questions that I was asked to give those answers. They're cutting out the questions to make it look like I'm saying those things on my own accord.

'They're cutting out the taunts and probing, the emotional reactions from other people as well, so you're [viewers] not seeing the whole story. You're seeing about five per cent of what's happening at that moment.'

Revealing that she wasn't usually one to 'pop off', Bella explained that the showdown with Irena began after she approached her about things that Izzy Sharman-Firth and Steph Harper had heard her saying.

'I was confronting her about some things I've heard, and she was denying them. Steph and Izzy actually heard her denying and came and sat down, and they were like, "hang on a second! Let's just rehash because now you're going to make Bella question our integrity."

Bella went on to say that she felt her 'smoke bubbling' at the time, and when Irena asked if their friendship was over, she said yes and walked off.

'Even in the moment, I was like f***, I shouldn't have done that!' Bella reflected.

Viewers watched Bella turn on Irena mid-season, after the women and Locky were forced to return to their homes during the coronavirus pandemic for three months.

Upon their return to the mansion, Bella branded Irena a 'manipulative little b***h' and claimed she was exaggerating her relationship with Locky.

Happily ever after: After telling both women he loved them, Locky chose Irena has his winner. The pair are still smitten and currently on a romantic road-trip before moving in together in Perth
