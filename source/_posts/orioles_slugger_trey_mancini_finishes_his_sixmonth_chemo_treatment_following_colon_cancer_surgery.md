Mancini said he was left 'speechless'  upon receiving a personalized, framed team picture

To mark the occasion, the Orioles gave Mancini a signed team picture feature his teammates wearing '#F16HT' t-shirts, which is a reference to his uniform number.

'I don't know what to say,' Mancini said in a video on the team's social media channels. 'I'm speechless now. This is one of the coolest things I've ever gotten, and I'm always going to cherish this.'

Mancini's tumor was discovered following a routine preseason physical, which revealed low iron levels in his blood. Ultimately a malignant tumor was detected.

Both Mancini and the team believe he can return to play next season.

Mancini, 28, batted .291 with 35 home runs and 97 RBIs last season while playing the outfield, at first base and as a designated hitter. He also had a career-best .364 on-base percentage.

He was one of few bright spots for the rebuilding Orioles last season. In addition to playing in 154 games and leading the team in homers and RBIs, Mancini played the role of clubhouse leader on a team filled with youthful players.

Though Baltimore has lost more than 100 games in each of the last two years, Mancini has been a standout offensively. In 2018, his second full season, he hit 24 home runs over 156 games.

Mancini made $575,500 last year. After reaching career highs in homers and RBIs, he was given a raise to $4.75 million in 2020.
