Kerry Katona hit the gym in Spain just days after her boyfriend, Ryan Mahoney, popped the question in a romantic proposal. 

The Atomic Kitten star, 39, looked incredible as she worked hard on her pre-wedding figure before cosying up to her beau in sweet snaps. 

The idyllic moments come after her hunky boyfriend proposed on Wednesday, during the family holiday in Granada - before which he made the sweet gesture first asked her kids for their mum's hand in marriage.

For Kerry, 39, this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay. 

 Earlier in the week, OK! Online shared pictures showing personal trainer Ryan on one knee as he surprised Kerry during her early 40th birthday celebrations in Spain. 

A source told the publication: 'Ryan is really close to all of Kerry's kids so he made sure he involved them before asking for Kerry's hand in marriage. He got Kerry a massive two carat diamond ring and showed it to the girls first and they all loved it.'  

Since then, Kerry took to Instagram to confirm the news as she shared sweet snaps with her family with the caption: 'Well what a bloody amazing 40th I’ve had.... honestly couldn’t of spent it any better with the people I love the most'.

Alongside a diamond ring Emoji, she then bashfully rounded out the post by writing: 'and with a massive twist too..... here we go again!'

Ensuring she is in perfect shape for the wedding, Kerry was seen getting to work on her wedding body as she got to work on her figure in the gym. 

Donning a red sports bra and shorts, she was showing her fitness prowess by performing sit ups and lifting a hefty weight in the gym. 

She then glammed up for a family day out, where she enjoyed a fruity cocktail and locked lips with the hunk during the outing.

Kerry shares children Molly, 18, and Lilly-Sue, 17, with Westlife star ex-husband Brian.  The singer also has Heidi, 13, and Maxwell, 12, with ex-husband Mark and Dylan-Jorge, six, with late ex-husband George. 

Back in June, Kerry praised Ryan for being 'the most normal relationship she's ever had and revealed she wanted him to propose. 

Speaking to New! Magazine, the ex Atomic Kitten star gushed about her love for Ryan saying: 'I can't see my life with anyone else, I trust him implicitly. He's dedicated, determined and loyal and he's been an incredible father figure to my kids.

She added, at the time: 'I've been looking at Cartier rings and I've even called up enquiring about one.'
