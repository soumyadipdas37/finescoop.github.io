Locky Gilbert seemed to miss the whole point of The Bachelor, breaking down in uncontrollable tears during the show's finale and claiming he couldn't choose between finalists Irena Srbinovska and Bella Veralis.

The 31-year-old Bachelor was openly conflicted throughout most of the finale, telling both women he was in love with them.

'They don't deserve it. They don't... Like... They don't deserve to get their heart broken. They're so beautiful,' he sobbed.

'Oh my God, just thinking about it. I don't wanna break anyone's heart. I love them both. How am I meant to do it? Like, you don't break up with someone that you love.' 

But fans weren't forthcoming in offering sympathy, brandishing his tears as insincere and pointing out that he knew he'd have to pick a winner.

Others labelled his tears as 'fake', after giving false hope to both Bella and Irena in the lead up to the show's climatic final rose ceremony.  

'Has Locky been studying at the Bella school of fake crying and dramatic monologues?' tweeted one viewer.

He later broke down again after telling Bella he hadn't chosen her, leaving the 25-year-old furious.

'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she fumed, before storming off.

An emotional Locky then told Irena, 31, that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, and added: 'I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole, whole package.'
