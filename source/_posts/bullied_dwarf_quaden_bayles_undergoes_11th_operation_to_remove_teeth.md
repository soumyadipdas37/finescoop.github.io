Quaden Bayles - the nine-year-old boy with dwarfism who made headlines around the world after revealing his battle with bullying - has undergone his 11th operation in just nine years. 

Quaden won hearts across Australia and overseas in February when his mother Yarraka filmed him saying he wanted to die after kids picked on him at school. 

He was admitted to Queensland Children’s Hospital on Monday to remove eight of his teeth because his mouth is overcrowded. 

Ms Bayles took to Facebook and shared an X-ray of Quaden's mouth to let his followers know about the surgery.

'Quaden just went under anaesthetic, needing 8 more teeth out, 7 years after he had 7 teeth out due to overcrowding as you can see from his most recent X-ray,' she wrote.

'We all know he’s got a big mouth but just not big enough for all these teeth trying to come through bless him.'  

On Tuesday, Ms Bayles shared an adorable photo of Quaden with his feet up and looking relaxed as he recovers from surgery.  

'Recovering like a champ and ready to go home today YAY!'

Ms Bayles also uncovered photos from Quaden's first surgery when he was just three years old and had to have seven teeth removed.

Quaden's story went viral in February after his mother filmed him crying and saying he wanted to end his life after being severely bullied by his classmates.

The brave boy received messages of support from celebrities and normal people from all over the world.

In the heartbreaking footage, Quaden - who has the most common type of dwarfism called achondroplasia -  is seen sobbing into the camera and saying he is suicidal from being relentlessly bullied. 

He told his mother: 'Give me a rope, I want to kill myself.' 

'I just want to stab myself in the heart... I want someone to kill me.' 

Quaden also scratched at his neck and said: 'I want to die... I want to scratch myself'.

Ms Bayles shared the video publicly on Facebook in a bid to raise awareness about the impact of bullying.
