Amy Childs has defended her decision to show one child on screen, but not the other. 

The TOWIE star, 30, shares daughter Polly, three, with her builder ex Bradley Wright, and son Ritchie Jr, two, with businessman ex Ritchie. 

Speaking to The Sun about their parenting styles, she explained that she and Ritchie's father made the decision to keep their child out of the public eye, which is why he hasn't been featured on social media or television.

Shockingly, Amy revealed she had been accused of not loving her son as much due to the decision. 

She explained: 'He is a beautiful little boy, he is like a mini-me and of course I love him every bit as much as Polly. Polly has a different dad and I made different decision with Polly and it is that simple.

'It was a hard decision because I don't want Ritchie or Polly to grow up and say why did you do that with me and not my brother and sister.

'All the constant messages questioning my love for Ritchie does get me down though because I love my children exactly the same.'

Outrageous: Shockingly, Amy revealed she had been accused of not loving her son as much due to the decision to keep him out of the limelight - which she made with Ritchie's dad 

Amy has protected Ritchie's privacy so fiercely that his name was not even revealed until March this year, when she accidentally let it slip in an interview.  

Meanwhile, although Amy has insisted she would never pressure Polly to follow in her footsteps with a career in reality television, she mused, 'I think she is made for TV'.

 Amy shot to fame on TOWIE in 2010 and returned for it's tenth anniversary special in a bid to get her 'confidence back.'

Making a comeback: Amy previously revealed she was excited to be making the comeback after taking time to focus on her family

Amy previously revealed she was excited to be making the comeback after taking time to focus on her family.

She said: 'I felt like I really needed this to get my confidence back. I was focusing on my kids and my business and I needed this to focus on myself again, so that definitely means seeing me more on TV.'  

After some of the original stars failed to appear on the reunion, Amy criticised Mark Wright for snubbing the special, saying the cast should remember 'where we have come from'.
