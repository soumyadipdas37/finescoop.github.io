She never puts a foot wrong with her daily fashion choices and has a work wardrobe that is the envy of many.  

And Ashley Roberts rocked another flawless ensemble as she left the Global Radio studios in central London after recording her Heart FM show on Friday.

The former Pussycat Dolls singer, 38, cut a chic figure in a striped top and a black satin slip dress as she strutted out carrying a bouquet of flowers.

Stylish: Ashley Roberts rocked another flawless ensemble as she left the Global Radio studios in central London after recording her Heart FM show on Friday 

She wore a knitted ivory top that featured scalloped black lines and embroidery detailing.

Ashley accessorised with a quilted Louis Vuitton mini bag and kept comfortable in white trainers.

The radio host wore a pair of black cat-eye shades as she strolled out of the studios with her beautiful bunch of blooms.

She styled her bangs in a middle parting which framed her face and showcased bronzed make-up look.

The blonde beauty was all smiles as she clutched the stunning bunch of fuchsia flowers, but it is unclear whether they were gifted by a secret admirer or simply a friend.  

Ashley has been single since ever since her split from Strictly Come Dancing professional, Giovanni Pernice.

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. 

She reflected on her breakup from the Italian dancer, 29, in an interview with Fabulous magazine last month. She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. 

'It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'
