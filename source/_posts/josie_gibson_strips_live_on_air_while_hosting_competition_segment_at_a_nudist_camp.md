Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby watched open-mouthed as Josie Gibson stripped live on air while hosting a competition segment from a nudist camp on Monday. 

The This Morning presenters were stunned when Josie, 35, surprised them by standing in front of an outdoor pool in Liverpool surrounded by naked men and women. 

Phillip, 56, burst out laughing as the former Big Brother winner proceeded to interview naturist Alan, who narrowly avoided accidentally flashing his manhood.

Josie slipped in plenty of innuendos as she interviewed Alan, who was protecting his modesty behind a fence, with viewers picking up on her funny puns.

One fan wrote: 'How many times can Josie say member at a naturist resort?', while another added: 'Turn on This Morning and Josie is at a old people’s nudest place in Liverpool?????'. 

'A third chimed: 'Josie asking a naked representative of a nudist community if they’ve seen a “rise in new members” I am HOWLING'.

After the interview, Josie decided to end the competition segment dramatically, by stripping off and diving in a pool. 

Stunned as to what he had just watched, Phil said: 'I don't really know what to say. That took me a bit by surprise.'

To which Holly, 39, replied: 'Isn't it a bit chilly for naturism today?'.  







'I'm howling': Viewers took to Twitter to say they found the whole exchange hilarious 

Winners: Phillip took a friendly jibe at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award

Elsewhere in the show,  Phillip  took a friendly jibe at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award.

The chat show took home the gong for Best Daytime Show with Alison Hammond presenting the award to the pair on during the programme.

With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!' after his win.  

Alison made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She said: 'This Morning has won a TV Choice Award for Best Daytime TV show everyone. It’s in the oven.  

'Because of Covid, there’s no award show or anything. This is the fifth one we’ve won now. We’ve beat GMB, Piers Morgan, Loose Women, The Chase.

Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers.'
