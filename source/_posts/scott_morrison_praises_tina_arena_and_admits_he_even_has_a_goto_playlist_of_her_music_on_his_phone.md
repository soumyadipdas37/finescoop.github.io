Prime Minister Scott Morrison previously described his love for Tina Arena's music as 'bordering on unhealthy.'

And it seems little has changed, as Mr Morrison, 52, has once again publicly praised the iconic songstress, 52, in a radio interview with Melbourne's GOLD104.3 on Thursday.  

'I'm a huge Tina Arena fan,' cooed the Prime Minister when asked whether he had a song request for the station.

'She's my favourite Melburnian and she's an amazing Australian artist. Overload, one of her recent albums, I've always enjoyed, but play me anything from Tina Arena and I'm happy,' he added.

When quizzed on whether Tina is is 'go-to artist', the politician admitted: 'I've got my Tina Arena playlist, all my favourites are on there.' 

Mr Morrison went on to praise Tina for 'always reaching out to people and trying to encourage them' during Victoria's strict COVID-19 lockdown.'

'She's an amazing Australian,' he gushed.  

In 2018 he rhapsodised about the songwriter to Perth radio station 98Five FM, admitting: 'My interest is unhealthy, bordering on unhealthy, but she's great.'

A year later, Mr Morrison gave Tina a plum $32,000-a-year taxpayer role sitting on the Australia Council Board - Australia's arts funding and advisory body.   

Tina was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in 2016 for her significant service in the music industry.

Dividing her time between Australia and France, she was also given a Knighthood of the French National Order in 2011.
