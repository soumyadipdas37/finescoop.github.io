Alessandra Ambrosio put her supermodel physique on full display, as she posed up a storm in a black push-up bra and a $450 pair of Burberry underwear on Tuesday. 

As the 39-year-old former Victoria's Secret Angel showcased her ample cleavage in a bustier, she leaned back on a cement wall with her chocolate mane cascading past her shoulders.  

While seductively smoldering at the camera, she slightly cocked her eyebrows and pursed her plump pout.  

 You are constantly creating who you are ✨

In the majority of snaps, photographed by Greg Swales, Ambrosio posed with her mouth slightly agape and flashing plenty of her sun-kissed skin.  

At one point, the Brazilian-born beauty stretched out on the floor with her toes pointed toward the ceiling.

'You are constantly creating who you are,' the mother-of-two captioned the sultry slideshow of herself. 

The stunner sounded like she had a blast during the shoot, as her photographer joked the images were a 'break' from her 'stretching/dancing' on set. 

In response to the pictures Swales uploaded of her on his personal Instagram account, Ambrosio commented she was 'loving our pics' with a red heart emoji. 

Swales replied that she was a 'dream' to work with and a 'heavenly angel.'

 Shifting into the vibration of love. ¿¿¿¿¿¿

Just two days earlier, she gave her 10.2 million followers a first look at additional images from her stunning photo shoot for the October edition of Elle Russia. 

Inside the high fashion magazine's glossy pages, Ambrosio can be seen sharing the spotlight with her 12-year-old daughter Anja and eight-year-old son Noah, who she shares with ex Jamie Mazur. 

On the cover, she can be standing against a wooden wall as she has her right arm around her little boy.

In another shot, the proud mom can be seen standing on one foot with her right arm reaching above her head, while standing between her two children. 

Meanwhile, Anja opted to pose stretching out on floor in front of her mom, as her brother did a semi-split.
