She split from her third fiancé Lucas Zwirner last month following a nearly two-year romance.

And Sienna Miller appeared to put her break-up behind her as she enjoyed a shopping trip in London's Notting Hill district on Wednesday.

The actress, 38, who had been living with art gallery heir Lucas, 29, in New York City, looked effortlessly chic while she ditched her engagement ring during the outing.

Exuding her signature style, the screen star teamed an edgy leather jacket with a grey T-shirt and burgundy culottes.

The Girl actress opted for comfort when it came to her footwear choice as she strolled along the streets of the English capital in a pair of £135 suede leather sandals by Birkenstock. 

Adding more colour to her appearance, Sienna carried her essentials in a bright yellow handbag, and accessorised with square-framed shades. 

Her blonde tresses were worn in a loosely-tousled fashion, while she proved safety comes first by sporting a protective face mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Sienna and her ex Lucas, the son of art dealer David Zwirner, got engaged back in January after a year of dating, but Page Six recently revealed they ended their relationship.

The report claims that it was the thespian who broke it off with the editor, though no reason for the separation was given. 

Representatives for both Miller and Zwirner did not respond to requests for comment from MailOnline at the time. 

Sienna was previously engaged to actors Jude Law, 47, in 2004 and Tom Sturridge, 34, the father of her daughter Marlowe, eight, in 2012.

In a 2017 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Sienna spoke about maintaining a friendship with her ex, saying of Tom, who is now reportedly dating actress Maya Hawke: 'We still love each other.' 

'I think in a break-up somebody has to be a little bit cruel in order for it to be traditional, but it's not been acrimonious in a way where you would choose to not be around that person.'  

'We don't live together, as has been reported recently, but we do half the time,' she added. 'Everybody will stay over or we'll all go on holiday and that's because we genuinely want to be around each other.'

'It's great for our daughter that she has two parents who love each other and are friends. He's definitely my best friend in the entire world.'

 The blonde has thrown herself into work as she and Michelle Dockery lead the cast of the new Netflix series Anatomy Of A Scandal.

According to Deadline, the TV and film stars will be joined by Rupert Friend on the series which is based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Sarah Vaughan.

The 2017 book focuses on high-profile Westminster politician James Whitehouse (Rupert) whose marriage begins to unravel when he is accused of rape.

His wife Sophie (Sienna) is convinced that he is innocent and will do whatever it takes to protect her family in the wake of the scandal.

Meanwhile, criminal barrister Kate (Michelle) is equally convinced that James is guilty and is determined to see he pays for his crimes. 

The show is from Big Little Lies creator David E. Kelley and former House of Cards showrunner Melissa James Gibson.
