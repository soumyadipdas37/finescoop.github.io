Britain's Indian summer heatwave is set to come to an end this week as the threat of a new lockdown looms over the UK - with temperatures set to plummet from tomorrow after heavy rain sweeps in from the north. 

Those in southern England will continue to bask in glorious 77F (25C) temperatures following a misty start today, before 'wintry' Arctic conditions are expected to sweep across the nation alongside potential 65mph winds by Thursday.

Cloudy conditions and washouts will cause temperatures to drop in the North West of England and parts of Scotland tomorrow, with a 'marked change' in weather expected throughout the rest of the week. 

In London, the mercury is set to fall from 75F (24C) on Tuesday to 59F (15C) on Thursday as forecasters warn there are 'big changes' incoming as the UK leaves summer behind following the Autumn Equinox tomorrow.

The gloomy weather comes as Boris Johnson looks set to make an announcement on any new Covid-19 restrictions tomorrow, as pressure builds for the Prime Minister to plunge Britain into a second lockdown. 

Sir Patrick Vallance today warned the UK faces 50,000 new daily cases of coronavirus by the middle of October and more than 200 deaths everyday by November if the disease is not brought under control. 

The Chief Scientific Adviser gave the warning as Professor Chris Whitty warned the UK has 'in a bad sense literally turned a corner' with rising rates of infection and that the nation needs to view the fight against the disease as a 'six month problem' before science eventually can 'ride to our rescue'.

Ahead of the sudden change in weather, Britons took to social media to warn 'a hardcore winter lockdown will be much worse than the last' - as people will have less opportunity to head outside.

One Twitter user said: 'People won’t stay at home without an extension of the furlough scheme and bad weather will restrict opportunities to get outside and exercise causing a deterioration in mental health. 

'We need an alternative.'

Another said: 'Lockdown Number 2 incoming. But with people in a much worse frame of mind and the weather being much s*****r.'

A third user added: 'The "advantage" of the lockdown was that it was spring/summer and lovely weather.

'Six months indoors during the winter isn't appealing for many! More people will just say "f*** this".'

Forecasters have warned amber weather alerts could be in place this week as what could be the first named storm of the season pushes heavy rain and winds of up to 65mph across the UK.  

The change in weather, which comes after the Autumn Equinox, could see washouts hit the North West from Tuesday and the south from Wednesday. In western parts of the UK, Storm Aiden will bring 65mph gusts.

Polar air is also expected to follow, with temperatures plummeting to 59F (15C) on Thursday and just 57F (13C) on Friday, which will also see parts of the north hit with temperatures between 51 and 53F (10C and 11C)

A Met Office spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Today will be warm in the sunshine with low 20C being reached quite widely. The highest temperatures will be in the southern UK where around 23 - 24C will be seen here, 25C may also be possible in isolated spots.

'Tomorrow will be another warm day across the bulk of the UK with temperatures widely 16 - 18C in Scotland, 20-23C in England and Wales, and locally 25-26C in parts of South East. 

'Temperatures will be lower in the North West with some cloud and rain bringing temperatures down although it will still be mid to high teens.

'There will be a marked change in temperatures as we go through the rest of the week with many seeing a 4 - 5C temperature drop as we see a change to cooler and more unsettled conditions.'

Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box told the Daily Star: 'Unsettled weather is possibly on the cards towards the end of September.

'While it is still early, a number of these cyclones in the Atlantic could have some influence on our weather as we head towards the final part of September.'

Meteorologist Susan Powell told the Mirror there are 'big changes to come in our weather in the next five days.'

'That will still be with us for Monday and Tuesday, [but] areas of low pressure will take over from the Atlantic, eventually dragging in Arctic air.'  

The sudden turn in the weather comes after more than 100,000 sunseekers rushed to Brighton on Sunday as temperatures across the UK rose higher than 73F in the Algarve, nudging 80F (26C).

Daytrippers clogged up coastal routes including the A23 to Brighton, A31 to Dorset and A30 to Cornwall on Sunday as Spain's Subtropical Storm Alpha pushed warm air towards the UK.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Deputy Chief Constable of Lancashire Constabulary Terry Woods said: 'Going to Blackpool, if you're not from Blackpool, this weekend and mingling in any large crowds, that is not looking after my family and it wouldn't be looking after your family. 

 'What we need to do is focus in on protecting yourself and your family. Make sensible decisions to protect yourselves, going to Blackpool in mass numbers is quite the opposite of protecting yourselves.'
