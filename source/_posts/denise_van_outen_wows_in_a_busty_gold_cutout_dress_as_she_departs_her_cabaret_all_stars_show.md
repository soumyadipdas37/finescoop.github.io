She has been channelling her inner Hollywood diva at the Cabaret All Stars show at Proud Embankment. 

And Denise Van Outen made sure she maintained the glamour off stage as she exited the venue in a gold cut-out dress on Saturday evening. 

The West End star, 46, showcased her ample cleavage and leggy frame as she sauntered back to her car following her night on stage.

She enhanced her natural beauty with a dewy makeup look and classic red lip. 

Before exiting the show, Denise posed up a storm with her co-stars Jessica and Isabella, who turned heads in their vintage-inspired, racy outfits. 

Denise recently returned to host her Cabaret show after it had to be postponed due to coronavirus. 

And it seems as though her talents have caught the attention of ITV bosses, as she has reportedly signed up to take part in the next series of Dancing On Ice.
