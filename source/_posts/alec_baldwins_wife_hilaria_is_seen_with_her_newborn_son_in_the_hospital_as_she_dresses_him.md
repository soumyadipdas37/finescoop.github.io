Hilaria Baldwin welcomed her fifth child, a son, with husband Alec Baldwin this week.

And on Thursday morning the 36-year-old yoga instructor was seen dressing her little boy, whose name has not yet been shared, for their trip home to meet his four siblings.

The Spanish-born beauty and the 62-year-old Hunt For Red October actor already have daughter Carmen, seven, and sons Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two. 

Ready to go! Hilaria Baldwin welcomed her fifth child, a son, with husband Alec Baldwin this week. And on Thursday morning the 36-year-old yoga instructor was seen dressing her little boy, whose name has not yet been shared, for their trip home to meet his four siblings

The child is seen in a blue and white striped snap-up onesie with a pink and white cotton cap on as he lays on a hospital bed with white sheets and a blanket.

Hilaria is dressed for comfort in a black sweatoutfit as her dark hair is pulled back in a clip and she has no makeup on. The Extra correspondent wears a simple wedding band on her ring finger. 

Alec, who got a tattoo of a foot on his arm that he flashed earlier in the day, is not seen.

'He is perfect': On Wednesday she announced the arrival of a baby boy via social media, sharing a sweet snap of her family's latest addition 

Hilaria explained she had to change the infant's clothing because he had an accident early on.

Alec showed off a footprint of his youngest child ink stamped on his arm 

'He peed on his first going home outfit,' she said in her caption. 'So we changed.' 

The star explained on Instagram Stories that her children already met the newborn on Facetime.

Son Romeo asked where the baby was, Carmen is 'obsessed' with the child and was talking possible names for her youngest brother.

Earlier on Wednesday, Hilaria, 36, had announced the arrival of baby number five for the couple via social media. 

Alec is also a father to daughter Ireland, 24, whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Basinger. 

'We had a baby last night. He is perfect and we couldn’t be happier. Stay tuned for a name,' Hilaria wrote alongside a snap showing her holding the newborn as she sat in her hospital bed with Alec by her side. 

Second wife: Alec and Hilaria, pictured in April 2019, wed in 2012. The actor was previously wed to Hollywood star Kim Basinger from 1993 to 2002

Their brood: The Spanish-born beauty and the 62-year-old Hunt For Red October actor already have daughter Carmen, seven, and sons Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two

This comes after Hilaria had a false labor alarm in late August.

She posted a selfie to her Instagram Story and explained: 'I've had a million kids but drove 3 hours to the dr today because I thought maybe I was in labor. You'd think I'd know by now.'

Hilaria went on: 'With living so far from the hospital due to COVID, I'm trying to anticipate labor even sooner.'

Baby news: The couple announced they were expecting again in April. In 2019, Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to their family in a quest for a second daughter; seen with three of their kids in 2018

She added: 'Literally was there for 10 min and had to drive 3 hours back home because I was not in labor. I'm wiped.'

She added the graphics 'Road Trip' and 'Baby On Board'.

In 2019, Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to her family, both of which she candidly documented on social media in an attempt to normalize them for other women.  

She and her Blue Jasmine actor husband wanted another daughter to their family after welcoming three boys and have publicly said they will continue trying until that happens.
