He's the Australian actor who has been based in New York for years with his family.  

And on Friday, Hugh Jackman was spotted wearing a face mask as he enjoyed a walk in the city, where he's been in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

The 51-year-old cut a casual figure in a black T-shirt from the Laughing Man Coffee Company, which is an ethical coffee shop chain that he co-founded.

Inspired by a poverty-stricken coffee farmer he met in Ethiopia, Hugh donates all of his profits from the coffee shop to support 'educational programs, community development and social entrepreneurs around the world'. 

During his walk on Friday, the Wolverine star teamed his T-shirt with navy blue chinos, blue shoes and had a sweatshirt wrapped around his waist.

The Greatest Showman star also held a protein shaker in one hand and what appeared to be keys. 

Lastly, he had his hair swept in a side-part for an effortless look.

Hugh was previously spotted going for a walk with his actress-wife Deborra-Lee Furness, 64, and their two dogs, Dali and Allegra, on Thursday.   

The couple and their children Ava, 14, and Oscar, 20, recently returned to New York from their stunning holiday home in the Hamptons. 

In July, Hugh revealed he was homesick for Australia after a lengthy lockdown in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Deborra-lee and the couple's children, Oscar and Ava, had initially been in Melbourne when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March.

But they returned to the U.S. just four days later in order to keep the family together.

Later this month, Hugh will virtually attend The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

He is one of five nominees up for an Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Limited TV series or Movie for his role as Frank Tassone in Bad Education. 

'I'm humbled by the nominations for both me and the film and excited to be named with such a talented group of actors,' Hugh said in a statement at the time. 

Due to the global health crisis, the Emmy Awards will be a bit different this year. 

Jimmy Kimmel will host the show from a stage inside California's Staples Center, which will have no red carpet or audience, Variety reported last month.
