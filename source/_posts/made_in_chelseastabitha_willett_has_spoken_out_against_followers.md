Honest: The former reality star later posted to her Instagram Stories to reveal that she had received 'quite a few DMs' questioning if she was 'pregnant' 

Captioning the snap, Tabitha, who promotes body confidence on social media, penned: 'The dreamiest little staycation this weekend.' 

However the former reality star later posted to her Instagram Stories to reveal that she had received 'quite a few DMs' questioning if she was 'pregnant'. 

Alongside the original picture, she wrote: 'I've had quite a few DMs asking if I was pregnant from my latest post, all from people I have never met.

Chic: Tabitha was originally set to exchange vows with Fraser at Fulham's Hurlingham Club in July

'I just thought I would say - no I'm not. I can't wait for that time to come but it's so personal and not something you should ask anyone until they feel comfortable to announce themselves.'

She continued: 'I speak really openly about my body and in particular how my tummy isn't flat anymore and I LOVE it and actually think it looks normal and feminine. 

'This is real and that's the reason I haven't photoshopped out the shadow and I think I still look nice even with the tummy. Let's be nice to one another.'  

Change of plans: The MIC star planned to exchange vows at the Fulham's Hurlingham Club in July with her beau but they will now get married at a register office for a smaller affair

It comes as Tabitha was originally set to exchange vows with Fraser at Fulham's Hurlingham Club in July in front of a host of celebrity guests until the pandemic forced the couple to cancel their plans. 

The pair now plan to tie the knot at an intimate ceremony as soon as September with the setback meaning their toddler daughter will be able to walk with her down the aisle.

Speaking to HELLO! magazine, she said: 'We have a couple of options that we could pull off, even within two weeks notice - well, 29 days, because that's how long you need to legally leave it after you give your notice - but we're waiting for the current laws to change.' 

Fraser proposed during a trip to Miami in November 2019, with a three-carat diamond engagement ring designed by Eden Rocks, the company run by MIC pal Spencer who is also expected to attend the wedding. 

Made In Chelsea co-stars and new parents, Hugo Taylor and Millie Mackintosh are also expected to attend the intimate wedding ceremony.
