Jadon Sancho will not leave Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United before the transfer window closes next week, club captain Marco Reus has revealed.

The England winger has been Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No 1 target for months but United have been unwilling to match the Bundesliga side's Â£108million valuation.

And despite Ed Woodward preparing a late bid worth up to Â£90m for Sancho, Reus expects the 20-year-old to remain in Germany for at least another season.Â 

Jadon Sancho won't leave Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United, claims Marco Reus

Dortmund captain Reus says Sancho will spend at least another year with the Bundesliga side

"He is an essential player for us." ðŸ–¤ðŸ’›Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus has told Sky Germany that Jadon Sancho is staying at the club...

Asked about Sancho staying at Dortmund rather than returning to England, Reus told Sky Germany: 'For us players that was great news.

'We all were happy that he will be with us for one more year because he delivers assists and goals, so we get points.'

Sportsmail understands that United have not yet given up hope of agreeing a deal with Dortmund and are readying a final attempt to bring him to Manchester.

The Red Devils will offer the Bundesliga club Â£65m up-front, with a further Â£25m in add-ons, potentially making the deal worth Â£90m depending on Sancho's success.

Should that bid fail, United will turn to other options. Watford's Ismaila Sarr, Napoli forwardÂ Arkadiusz Milik and Juventus winger Douglas Costa are among those to have been linked with a switch to Old Trafford.

Reus expects Sancho to leave Dortmund at the end of this season, particularly if he continues to develop his game at the same rate.Â 

'If he gets as big as (Lionel) Messi or Ronaldo, we will see,' the Germany midfielder added.

'He needs time, experience and it will be important how he manages the times when things don't go so well. But he has the confidence and the quality.'Â 

United have endured a frustrating transfer window so far, only signing Holland midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax in a Â£40m deal.Â
