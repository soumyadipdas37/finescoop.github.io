Joe Hildebrand bid farewell to Studio 10 viewers last week after seven years as a panellist on the Channel 10 morning show.

And on Wednesday, the 44-year-old journalist discussed the real reason he quit the program in his column for New Corp.

Joe dispelled rumours he was 'forced out' by the network because he was 'too right-wing or too left-wing or too unpredictable'.

He said the reality of his departure was far more mundane.

'The boring truth is the network just needed to cut costs and I quit rather than take on a lesser role,' he explained.

'But nobody would want to watch that, so tell the world I went out in a blaze of glory,' he jokingly added.

Joe's column comes after Channel 10 aired a promo for Studio 10 on Monday night that featured him, despite the fact he's no longer on the panel.

He was shown in the promo alongside fellow panellist Kerri-Anne Kennerley and newsreader Natarsha Belling, who have also been sacked. 

He tweeted a photo of the ad and wrote: 'Not sure they ran the right promo tonight! Best of luck though gang!'

On Thursday, Joe broke down in tears live on air as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to leave after seven years. 

'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.

'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role. We talked about it openly and warmly about what that might look like.'

Speaking of his bosses' reaction when he told them he was leaving Studio 10, Joe said: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them!'

'I have given it a huge amount of thought': On Thursday, Joe broke down in tears live on air as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to leave after seven years. He said: '[I want to] give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around'

'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of,' he added.

'[I want to] give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around.'

Taking over Joe's role as co-host alongside Sarah Harris is Dancing with the Stars judge Tristan MacManus, who began on Monday.
