Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases.



Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.

There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30.  

Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital. 

The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.

The French government recently announced that it would be pumping €100billion (£91billion) into the economy as part of a recovery plan. 

Politician Macron hopes that this will help the French economy to get moving again by 2022. 

Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6. 

Alicia's appearance came after she admitted she feels 'very lucky' she never developed an eating disorder when she trained in ballet during her younger years.

In a new interview, the screen star, who mastered the performance dance from the tender age of nine, reflected on the pressures of the art form as she insisted: 'Looking at your body in a mirror seven hours a day is not healthy.'

The Swedish beauty credited her stage actress mother Maria for helping her to navigate the demands she faced while growing up as a ballerina.

In October's edition of ELLE magazine, Alicia said: 'Being in a leotard looking at your body in a mirror seven hours a day, six days a week and having people talk about your body in front of you and in front of other girls and boys, growing up with that is not healthy. 

'I was very lucky to go through ballet school without having an eating disorder. I don't know how, I think it was my mum who talked about it to me every day.'

The Tomb Raider star trained in ballet at the Svenska Balettskolan i Göteborg  (Swedish National Ballet School) in Gothenburg from 1998 until 2004.

At 15, the skilled star relocated from the country's second-largest city to train at the its upper school in Stockholm, where she lived alone in a small flat. 

The media personality previously detailed her time at the educational facility in an interview with the Telegraph.

The actress told the publication back in 2015: 'They have a boarding school now but they didn’t have back then.

'I lived in a tiny flat. It was like half a room with a tiny kitchenette. I even had a minibar because it didn’t have a fridge. It was in an old house, beautiful, with wooden floors, but it was basically a big closet.

‘Now when I see 15-year-olds I think, ''how did I do it?'' But it was worse for my mum. I felt horrible leaving her.'

 The Anna Karenina star was also instructed at the American Academy of Ballet in New York for one summer.
