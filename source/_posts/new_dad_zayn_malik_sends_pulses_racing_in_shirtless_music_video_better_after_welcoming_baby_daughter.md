Zayn Malik has released his new music video Better on YouTube on Friday, after a two-year music hiatus.

It's been a huge week for the singer, 27, who announced on Wednesday he had welcomed his first child, a baby girl, with girlfriend Gigi Hadid, 25.

And Zayn didn't disappoint fans as he appeared on camera shirtless in his racy music video.

The video started with Zayn showing off his tattooed physique as he lay asleep on the sofa, with his shirt and suit blazer placed on the cushions. 

As he walked around the house with glass doors, a man with binoculars peered in. 

The former 1D, who sported red hair, later put on his suit to sit on the edge of the sofa and sing the love ballad.

It comes just two days after the former One Direction star announced the birth of his daughter in a touching social media post, calling their precious gift 'healthy and beautiful.'

'Our baby girl is here, healthy & beautiful' the Pillowtalk singer wrote along with a black and white photo of his heavily tattooed hand holding on to his and the 25-year-old supermodel's pride and joy.

'To try put into words how i am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The love i feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, & thankful for the life we will have together x'

Shortly after Gigi shared her own message, writing: 'Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she's already changed our world. So in love.'

Excitement has been building for Zayn's new release after the ex One Direction star posted a 14 second clip of the music video earlier this week, which comes two years after his second solo album 'Icarus Falls'.

Revealing the title of the new song, 'Better' in a tweet to his 29.4million followers, Zayn gave a sneak-peek at the racy video which offered a glimpse of the star shirtless. 

Zayn has been teasing his return to music for a number of weeks, posting an Instagram snap at the beginning of September with the caption 'Got some stuff to show ya soon!'

Zayn's 2018 album Icarus Falls received good reviews but peaked at just 61 on the US Billboard 200 and 77 on the UK Albums Chart. 

The singer has been open about his struggles with anxiety which has led to him rarely performing live during his solo career.

During a 2017 interview with Vogue, the star admitted: 'I always feel like I'm trying to work through whatever certain issues are around certain subjects.' 

The news Gigi and Zayn were expecting first emerged in April after a 'family source' spilled the beans about the IMG beauty and her on/off boyfriend of five years.

Parental pride! 'Our baby girl is here, healthy & beautiful' the Pillowtalk singer wrote along with a black and white photo of his heavily tattooed hand holding on to his pride and joy 

Shortly after she confirmed the news herself. 

Gigi said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. 

'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.' 

Gigi hinted that her child was on the way at the end of August when she shared a stunning photo of herself at 33-weeks.
