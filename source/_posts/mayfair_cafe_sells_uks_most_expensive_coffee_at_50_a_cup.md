Caffeine lovers with deep pockets are being invited to buy the UK's most expensive coffee at £50 for a cup of filter brew. 

Queens of Mayfair, on Queen Street, Mayfair, has just 15 servings available of the Ethiopian 'Cup of Excellence', which is made from rare beans that recently sold for £2,000 per kilogram at auction.

The coffee shop, found in London's poshest district, is selling the drink on a first come, first served basis - with the £50 price tag getting customers either one large or two small cups for sharing.

The cafe's roaster, Difference Coffee - which processes and supplies the beans, was one of only two British buyers, with just eight businesses being invited to the auction in June this year.

With an industry grading of 94 out of 95 and having won this year's 'Cup of Excellence' contest - a competition between suppliers from across the world, the steep cost is perhaps of little surprise.

Grounded by hand, the beans are then brewed in a special v60 filter - which allows the coffee to flow through extremely slowly thanks to the fine paper used. 

The finished product is enjoyed in a crystal wine glass and the flavour is said to develop and intensify as the coffee cools.

It's said to boast a light, fruity and floral flavour and guests will be served by Queens' head barista, Sabrina Pastano, who is an authorised Speciality Coffee Association trainer.

Thanks to a Fairtrade deal, the Ethiopian farmers of the coffee will get the full auction price for their beans.

 Co owner of Queens of Mayfair, Victoria Sheppard said: 'We pride ourselves on the finest produce throughout our menu at Queens of Mayfair, to have such a rare and highly sought after coffee to offer true connoisseur highlights the standards we are aiming for.'

Owner of Difference Coffee, Queens roasters, Amir Gehl added: 'We are extremely excited to continue our collaboration with Queens of Mayfair in terms of pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of quality and by showcasing one of the worlds best certified coffees. 

'Not only is it an incredible and rare commodity it is also making a difference to the farmers in Ethiopia.' 

Queens is open from breakfast through to after-work drinks before turning into a private dining and events space in the evening. 

Morning meals include smoked salmon, various egg dishes, pastries, cakes and homemade pancakes. At lunch, salads, soups and sandwiches fill the menu, while there's also a grab and go section available.

The evenings at Queens offer cocktails, English wine and champagne along with gourmet sausage rolls and sharing platters.
