Jack O'Connell is expected to miss the rest of the season as he requires a knee operation. 

The Sheffield United defender was left out of the Blades' Yorkshire Derby with Leeds United on Sunday and manager Chris Wilder revealed the centre-back will be out for an extended period. 

O'Connell has suffered with the knee issue for around a year and the 26-year-old missed a cluster of matches in Sheffield United's promotion campaign and just after the coronavirus hiatus earlier this year with the injury.

The 26-year-old played in United's first two Premier League matches of the season

Speaking before the Bramall Lane encounter, Wilder said: 'It's really bad news from our point of view. Jack's possibly going to be out for the rest of the season. 

'He needs an operation on a knee he injured last year. He's tried to come back, we've had it scanned and he was a big part of the back three who did outstandingly well last season. 

'We've got to adjust pretty quickly but it's just more bad news for Jack really because he established himself well in the Premier League last year. 

'He had a fabulous season and for him to be out for the rest of the season is a huge blow for him and us.'

Chris Wilder confirmed the devastating blow just before the Blades' match with Leeds United

O'Connell played 33 times in the Premier League last term as Sheffield United finished ninth

The 26-year-old played 33 times for the Blades as they stunned the Premier League to finish in ninth place after 12 years away from the top-flight. 

The injury has come at a bad time for Wilder's side as John Egan missed the Leeds match due to a suspension in their defeat to Aston Villa last Monday. 

Chris Basham, Jack Robinson and debutant Ethan Ampadu started the Leeds match in a back three, with the latter making his first Premier League start following his loan move from Chelsea earlier this year. 

The Blades also have Phil Jagielka , Kean Bryan and Kyron Gordon at the club as centre-half options.
