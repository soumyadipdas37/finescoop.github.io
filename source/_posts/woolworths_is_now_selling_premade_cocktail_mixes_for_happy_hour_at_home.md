According to the product description, the product was crafted to 'keep life simple' as the cocktails can be made quickly by combining the mixer with a spirit of choice over ice.

Each 750mL bottle makes ten cocktails and is perfect for small groups of people or for social occasions.

The Box Mixers bottles are exclusively sold at Woolworths supermarkets. 

Each non-alcoholic mixer is gluten-free, low in sugar and Australian made using natural flavours and ingredients

As each mixer is made with 75 per cent natural Australian ingredients, there is a lack of added preservatives and flavours, so customers can drink the product without feeling guilty or conscious of the sugar contents.

The cosmopolitan mixer is made with water, cranberry juice concentrate, glucose syrup, lime juice, food acids and natural flavours and colours, while the espresso martini mixer is made using coffee, water, glucose syrup, vegetable gum and natural flavours.

Both the mojito and margarita mixers are made using lime juice, water, lemon juice, foods acids, glucose syrup and natural flavours.
