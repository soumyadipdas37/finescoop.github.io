They recently made an uncharacteristically low-key arrival in the Italian city.

But Hailey Bieber sure made up for things as she put on a very glamorous display while stepping out with pal Kendall Jenner during Milan Fashion Week on Saturday.

The model wife of Justin Bieber, 23, stunned in a tailored monochrome blazer while fellow model Kendall, 24, looked chic in a brown maxi dress.

Hailey gave a glimpse of her toned midriff as she wore a tiny black bralette beneath the jacket, pairing her look with simple black leggings.

The beauty added towering, pointed heels to her look, while she carried her essentials in a mini Yves Saint Laurent handbag.

Hailey, who clutched a cup of coffee, kept her head down while she walked, while a majority of her face was concealed by dark sunglasses and a black face mask.

Looking good: Fellow model Kendall, 24, looked chic in a brown maxi dress which she teamed with chunky black boots.

Kendall meanwhile kept her look a tad more simple, with a plain, long-sleeved dress, which she teamed with chunky black boots.

She tucked a tiny black handbag in the crook of her arm, and like her friend, covered up with a face mask. 

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in the BOSS show on Friday.

Kendall's outing comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian. 

'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. 

In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  

'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked. 

'Absolutely,' Kylie replied back.

Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image 

Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. 

The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair color. 

Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling.
