During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella Varelis and Irena that he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.

After an emotional break-up with Bella, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena , telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.

'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the nurse.  

'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'

 So happy! During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky professed his love for Irena, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her

In a new interview with Who magazine, the happy couple revealed the codenames they used to communicate with each other while the show was airing.   

'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky admitted, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.

'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.  

'Douglas is Locky's middle name so that's where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.

Love: 'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the nurse
