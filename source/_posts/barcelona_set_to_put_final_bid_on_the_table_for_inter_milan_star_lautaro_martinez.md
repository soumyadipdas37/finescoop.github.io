Barcelona are planning to make a final offer for Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez.

Recently-appointed Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has informed Luis Suarez that he isn't in his plans, with Juventus looking to sign the Uruguayan.

As reported by goal, Martinez is at the top of Barcelona's wishlist as they look to bring in a new striker, despite links with Lyon's Memphis Depay.

Martinez has demonstrated his credentials for Inter, having scored 30 goals in 84 appearances since joining from Racing Club in 2018.

Crucially, Martinez is ten years younger than Suarez, with Barcelona looking to rebuild their squad.

Suarez is in talks with Barcelona over the termination of his contract, which expires next year.

Martinez could end up replacing Luis Suarez, who is eager to secure a move to Juventus

New Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman is tasked with trying to reshape the club's squad 

As reported by Marca, the striker has reportedly agreed a £9million-a-year salary with Juventus.

According to ESPN, Suarez is training away from the main group at Barcelona alongside Arturo Vidal until his future is sorted. 

Barcelona have already brought in Miralem Pjanic, as well as having previously secured deals for Pedri and Francisco Trincao.

There is still much more work to do, however, as Koeman seeks to get Barcelona to bounce back following a hugely frustrating campaign.

Barcelona have also been linked with a move for Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, who Koeman knows well from his time in charge of the Dutch national team.
