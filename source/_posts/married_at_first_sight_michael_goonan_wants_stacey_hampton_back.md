Former Married At First Sight couple Stacey Hampton and Michael Goonan recently rekindled their friendship.

But it appears the 28-year-old businessman hasn't quite got over his ex-'wife', as a source tells Daily Mail Australia he is secretly hoping they will reconcile.

'They're good friends now, but Michael wants her back,' the source said on Monday. 

Claims Michael Goonan 'wants his ex girlfriend Stacey Hampton back' after her plans to relocate to Melbourne to 'start a family' with her new man were revealed. (Pictured together)

'Michael doesn't approve of her new relationship and is doing everything he can to try and get Stacey to visit him in the Gold Coast,' they added.

It comes just days after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Stacey was planning to relocate from Adelaide to Melbourne to pursue her new romance.

'Stacey's head over heels for her new man, and I have never seen her happier,' a source close to the mother of two said last week. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Monday, a source close to the couple has claimed Michael is hoping to reignite his romance with the 27-year-old blonde bombshell

'She's already started to pack her bags and she's ready to get on the first flight out once border restrictions are lifted,' they added.

Last week, Stacey and Michael proved they had put their differences aside by catching up for lunch in Adelaide.

Their friendly reunion came after Michael had made a public appeal on Instagram for her to give him another chance - as mates.

'Michael doesn't approve of her new relationship and is doing everything he can to try and get Stacey to visit him in the Gold Coast,' the source added

Earlier this month, he shared a throwback photo of the former couple in happier times and wrote: 'So publicly Stacey. Wanna be my friend again?'

The millionaire's plea to Stacey came after his break up with fellow Married At First Sight star KC Osborne in July.

KC blamed their break-up on Michael's unwillingness to change his 'playboy' ways. 

Reminiscing:  Last Friday, Michael and Stacey first hinted that they've rekindled their friendship when Michael shared a video of the former couple in happier times
