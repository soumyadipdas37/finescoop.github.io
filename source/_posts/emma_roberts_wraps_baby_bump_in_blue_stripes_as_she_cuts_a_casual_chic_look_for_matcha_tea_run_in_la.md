Since Belletrist was started by Roberts as a book club with pal Karah Preiss (who also serves as executive producer), they shouldn't have any trouble coming up with more content.

Roberts told British Vogue last month: 'I always love the feeling of starting a new book that you’ve been excited to read. Especially lately, just diving into a new book and really getting to spend the day or the night reading has been such a luxury. 

'It gets me so excited, because then I keep thinking of all the friends I’m going to get a copy for, if they’re going to like it, and what we’re going to talk about. I just think a good book is just the best conversation starter.' 

She also stars in the upcoming holiday romantic comedy Holidate, which premieres October 28 on Netflix.
