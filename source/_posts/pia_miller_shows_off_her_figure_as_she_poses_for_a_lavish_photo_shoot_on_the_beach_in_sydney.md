Former Home and Away actress Pia Miller looked glamorous as she posed for a lavish photo shoot on Sydney's Palm Beach on Wednesday.

The brunette beauty, 36, flaunted her incredible physique in a series of outfits as she posed up a storm on the shore.

During the photo shoot, Pia showed off her tiny waist in a dark brown dress while she wore a necklace from jewellery brand Paspaley.

Her long hair was styled straight and she appeared to be wearing a neutral palette of makeup for the shoot.

The actress had all eyes on her as she posed for a series of photos on the sand, while holding onto her long dress.

After posing for several photographs, Pia changed into a glamorous beige coloured flowy dress.

The photo shoot comes after Pia reunited with her multi-millionaire agent boyfriend Patrick Whitesell, 55.

The former Home and Away actress spent a week with her beau, before Patrick flew back to the US on a private jet, last week.

Pia was first linked to the Hollywood power agent in August last year, following her split with her longtime fiancé, Tyson Mullane, 32, in April.

The couple made their public debut at a Halloween party in Los Angeles in October, amid reports they'd started dating back in May. 

She made their relationship Instagram official on Christmas Eve, sharing a loved-up photo with him outside of the Louvre in Paris, and captioning it 'P²'.

The couple made their red carpet debut when they attended the Oscars together in February this year in Los Angeles.
