The Bachelorette's Carlin Sterritt was spotted with self-described 'wellness expert' Andi Lew in Bondi Beach on Friday, following his split from Angie Kent.

And Daily Mail Australia can reveal that Andi, 46, is a longtime anti-vaccination activist who refuses to get her 10-year-old son, Beaudy, vaccinated.

She was featured in a Nine News segment in 2014 about parents in wealthy Melbourne suburbs like South Yarra choosing not to immunise their children.

Medical experts recommend annual vaccination for children aged six months or older to reduce their chances of becoming ill with influenza.

'If vaccinations work, then why are you so worried about whether I vaccinate my child or not?' Andi said in the news segment.

After her media appearance, she posted three photos and one short video of the segment to Instagram.

'I am not anti or for. I'm pro-choice. I think people must be educating themselves on the effectiveness and safety around conventional vaccines and making an informed choice to boost their child's immune system safely,' she captioned one of the posts.

Many anti-vaccination campaigners are beginning to use the term 'pro choice' - which is most commonly associated with abortion rights - instead of 'anti-vaxxer' in order to make their views seem more socially acceptable.

'We don't put anyone at risk. If vaccines work and your kid is immunised, why should you care if we don't?' she wrote alongside another post. 

In May this year, Andi posted a photo of herself with her son alongside a caption that falsely compared getting vaccinated to 'ingesting toxins'. 

'How is mandating toxicity "health"? My son has never had a toxin ingested or injected in his ten and a half years and he's never been sick,' she wrote.

'His pure body and my choice, right? He told me when he becomes a world leader, he will make healthy eating and chiropractic care mandatory.'

Infants and children younger than five years of age are at high risk of getting severe influenza infections that require hospitalisation, according to NSW Health. 

About 10 per cent of hospitalised infants and children need care in an intensive care unit, and some - even previously healthy children - will die.

Influenza vaccination is provided for free under the National Immunisation Program for all children aged six months to five years.

Dangerous views: Andi believes vaccinations are akin to 'ingesting toxins' - but medical experts highly recommend immunisation to avoid hospitalisation and even death

Andi went on a lunch date with former Bachelorette star Carlin at a café in Sydney's Bondi Beach on Friday.

The sighting came after Carlin confirmed in July that he had split from Angie Kent, whom he'd met on last year's season of The Bachelorette.

While Carlin is single, Andi insisted their meet-up was only for creative purposes. 

'Carlin was helping me shoot something actually. And I'm very grateful, he's so creative,' she said on her Instagram Story.
