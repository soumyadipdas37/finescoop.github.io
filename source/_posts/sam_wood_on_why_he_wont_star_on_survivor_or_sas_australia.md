Former Bachelor Sam Wood has created a lucrative fitness empire with wife Snezana Markoski, since meeting her on the 2015 season of the dating franchise.

But in an interview with Daily Mail Australia this month, Sam insisted he and his incredibly toned partner are not the 'ultimate fit couple'. 

When asked how dedicated Snezana is when it comes to diet and exercise, the 40-year-old personal trainer described her routine as 'very normal'.

'That's a nice compliment (the ultimate fit couple) but Snez is very normal,' Sam said.

'Snez would do three hard workouts a week with dumbbells or bodyweight from my 28 by Sam Wood program, one yoga session and just lots of walking with the kids.' 

The couple, who have been surviving lockdown in Melbourne with their young family, always have plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and produce on hand.

Snezana, 38, and Sam share daughters Willow, two, and Charlie, one. Sam is also a stepfather to Snezana's daughter Eve, 15, from a previous relationship.  

'We always have fresh fruit and vegetables, but spending a little time on your Sunday to make healthy snacks like protein balls or a zucchini slice, can be a lifesaver,' Sam advised. 

'The freezer is also your friend; if you're trying to avoid multiple supermarket trips, then don't be afraid to cook recipes in bulk, and stash some meals in containers in the freezer.' 

While Sam often enjoys a run in the fresh air, he also incorporates some key exercises that can be done at home into his regime.

'Nothing beats going for a run for your fitness and mental wellbeing, but if you are looking for a good at home option to get that heart rate up, try burpees, squat jumps, kick sits, ladder climbers and skipping,' Sam recommended.

'Complete each exercise for 40 seconds with a 20 second rest period, and four rounds for a 20-minute killer circuit.'   

And while one might assume Sam would be open to appearing on a fitness-based reality show such as Australian Survivor or SAS Australia, he says it's not this 'thing'.

'Those shows are fantastic but it's not really my thing. I move to feel good and be a good role model for my kids. When I get asked what I'm training for, I guess my answer is life,' Sam explained.
