Turkey has accused Greece of 'piracy' and attempting to 'arm' the island at the centre of their row energy resources in the Mediterranean.

Tensions between the two countries have escalated with both sides staging military drills in the area.

Kastellorizo is the island furthest removed from Greece and is 1.2 miles off the Turkish coast. 

Greece argues that waters surrounding the rocky island are under their sovereignty and oppose any Turkish exploration nearby.

Images published last week show Greek soldiers arriving on the island - known as Kastellorizo in Greece and Meis in Turkey - much to Ankara's frustration.  

'Greece's attempt to arm the island of Meis is an example of a new piracy,' said Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party.

'It's stupidity to direct weapons toward Turkish shores,' Celik wrote on Twitter, adding: 'Greece will learn we will have a strong answer to every step it takes.'

The Turkish foreign ministry on Sunday pointed out that the island was 'under a demilitarised status established with the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty'.

'Such provocative actions will prove useless for Greece,' the Turkish ministry said.

As the political pressure mounts, 'we're keeping an eye out, but we're staying calm and not changing anything about our everyday life',  the island's deputy mayor Stavros Amygdalos said.

On August 10, Turkish navy ships escorted an exploration vessel, the Oruc Reis, into the waters south of Kastellorizo.

Four days before, Greece had signed an agreement with Egypt on the two countries' respective maritime economic zones, which the parliament in Athens waved through on Thursday.

But its claim that the waters around the island are under Greek sovereignty had Ankara seeing red, after recent discoveries of large gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fumed that acknowledging Greek jurisdiction in the region would mean 'imprisoning Turkey within its coastline'.

And a Greek and a Turkish warship were involved in a mild collision on August 14 during a standoff in the eastern Mediterranean, in what a Greek defence source called an accident but Ankara described as a provocation.  

The Greek frigate manoeuvred to avoid a head-on collision and in the process its bow touched the rear of the Turkish frigate, a defence source said, calling it a 'mini collision.'

'It was an accident,' the source said, adding the Limnos was not damaged.

 It subsequently took part in a joint military exercise with France off Crete on Thursday morning, the person said.

Greece has issued no official comment on the two neighbours' latest dispute.

Relations between the two neighbours have been souring for months.

In February Turkey encouraged migrants to flee to Europe by opening its border with Greece. 

It also converted some Byzantine churches into mosques this year.

Tensions are also growing between Turkey and France, another NATO ally, which has opted to throw its full weight of support behind Greece.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that Paris had adopted a 'red-line policy' for Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean, though he also called for dialogue.

'When we talk about sovereignty in the Mediterranean, I must be consistent in actions and words... the Turks only consider and respect that,' Macron said.

But Ankara said Turkey would not be pushed around by Macron.

'Those, who think to have drawn red lines against the righteous cause of Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean, will only face Turkey's firm stance,' Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement late on Sunday.

He called for 'those, who are in delusion of grandeur, to face reality,' adding: 'The era of defining imperialist conceptions by drawing lines on maps is long gone.'
