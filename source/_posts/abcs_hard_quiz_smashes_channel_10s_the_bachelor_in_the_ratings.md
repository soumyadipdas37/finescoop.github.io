Despite The Bachelor's poor ratings, the episode was still the No. 1 show of the night among viewers under 50.

The much-anticipated finale of The Bachelor on Thursday night will see Locky Gilbert choose between Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis. 

He recently shit down rumours that he's no longer dating the winner, telling New Idea he was '110,000 per cent in love' with his chosen contestant.

'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to reveal his girlfriend.

'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.' 

According to betting odds, Irena is predicted to win, although there's still a chance that Bella could leave with Locky in an upset.
