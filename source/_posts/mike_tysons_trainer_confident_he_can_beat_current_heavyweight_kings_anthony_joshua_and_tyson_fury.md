Mike Tyson's trainer is confident that the 54-year-old can become a world champion again, as the boxing icon prepares to make his comeback to the sport.

Iron Mike is in training for his boxing return, when he takes on Roy Jones Jr in an exhibition bout on November 28. Tyson retired in 2005 but has looked in sensational shape in training.

The 54-year-old has been working out for six or seven hours a day, with video footage of the former champion in training showing he is still a man to be feared among heavyweights.

The 54-year-old has looked sensational as he prepares to face Roy Jones Jr in November

One clip showed Tyson almost knocking out his trainer, Rafael Cordeiro, while hitting the pads during a session. 

Cordeiro revealed he has been left stunned by Tyson's work in camp, despite his age, and feels that the former world champion could still challenge current heavyweight kings Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury.

'I believe Mike can do it. If he put his mind, he wanna fight for the belt one day, why not? Who says it's impossible to do?' Cordeiro told TMZ.

'He's fighting every single day in the gym and I believe the best is still to come.

'Why not? If one day he wants to prove, he put his techniques to the test, why not [fight for] for the belt? He is improving every day. He does not look like a 54-year-old fighter.'

Tyson is set to face former world champion Jones Jr in November, but the 51-year-old is wary that he could be the next of many victims to fall to Iron Mike.

'He's still Mike Tyson, he's still one of the strongest, most explosive people who ever touched a boxing ring,' Jones Jr told Sky Sports. 

'If anything, I made a mistake going in with him. He's the bigger guy, he's the explosive guy.

'When it comes time to fight, we're going to fight. If it comes down to bite, we're going to bite. Whatever has to happen, is going to happen, that's just what it is.'
