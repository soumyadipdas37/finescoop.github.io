She returned to her reality TV roots for MTV's reboot last year of The Hills: New Beginnings.

But with filming for a second season on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, Whitney Port has been spending more time with her family.

The 35-year-old was seen out and about Monday morning in LA with husband Tim Rosenman and their three-year-old son Sonny.

The trio put on a very laid back show in their casual clothing.

Whitney was dressed in a long and baggy pale green sweatshirt which she paired with loose-fitting black and white horizontally-striped pants. 

Hubby Tim wore a pale blue sweatshirt and calf-length baggy beige shorts, and covered up with a dark green cloth face mask in accordance with California's coronavirus regulations.

Sonny had on a long-sleeve top and trousers and held onto both his parents' hands as they walked along.

Port met Rosenman when he served as a producer on another of her reality shows The City and the two tied the knot in 2015. 

The reality TV star has candidly shared with her social media followers that she's conflicted about whether to have a second child. 

'I know deep down I would like to have another baby. I want Sonny to have another sibling. I feel it would complete our family,' she said on a recent episode of her podcast With Whit. 

However, she admitted: 'I really don't feel in a mentally stable place to get pregnant right now.'

She added that due to all the restrictions and rules in place due to COVID-19, 'the thought of having a baby right now, terrifies me'.
