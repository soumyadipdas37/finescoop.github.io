DeIe Alli has not been included in the squad to face Lokomotiv Plovdiv as he faces the prospect of leaving Tottenham.

Alli is one of eight players to have remained in London ahead of the Europa League tie in Bulgaria, as significant doubts emerge over his future.

Sportsmail reported this week how Tottenham had considered using Alli as a potential sweetener in their move to bring Gareth Bale back to Tottenham.

Alli was discussed as being part of a swap deal which could see Gareth Bale join Spurs

That scenario is looking unlikely, however the prospect of Alli leaving Spurs before the October 5 transfer deadline is starting to look a realistic possibility - his exclusion from the travelling party on Wednesday is another indicator that his future, at least this season, may remain elsewhere.

While Alli’s talent is undoubted, there is a mutual feeling from all parties the midfielder could benefit from a move away to reinvigorate his career - particularly if it becomes clear Alli won’t be playing regularly this season.

With Bale’s planned arrival, competition for places in attacking midfield positions will become fiercer in the coming weeks.

If the 24-year-old is made available, then there will be no shortage of takers domestically and in Europe.

But there is likely to be a reluctance to sell Alli on a permanent basis from within the club given the depreciated market caused by Covid - particularly for a player who not long ago was valued in the region of £100million.

Tottenham would also prefer to loan Alli to an overseas club so not to strengthen a domestic rival.

Paris Saint Germain have monitored Alli for a number of years, while Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte is known to be a long-term admirer.

Alli, by his own admission, has not lived up to the sky-high standards he has set himself after bursting onto the scene in sensational fashion five years ago.

Having become an integral part of Gareth Southgate’s team at World Cup 2018, during which England euphorically made it to the semi-finals, Alli has lost his place in the national squad.

A string of unfortunate injuries has played a key role in the midfielder losing his place in the England set-up.

But with the European Championships just nine months away, Alli knows he needs to playing regularly to have any chance of breaking back into Southgate’s squad. 

Alli started Sunday’s 1-0 opening day loss to Everton - but was substituted at half-time sparking suggestions of a row between the Mourinho and the midfielder.

But the Tottenham boss is adamant there has been no bust-up, saying: ‘Dele is a very polite guy, very calm. He’s a bit introspective, when you think a lot about things.

‘The way he reacted was Dele. It was quiet, sad, but in the end, after the game, he was just one of many. And I never saw from him in here with myself, with the other players, everybody at the club, I never saw a strong reaction. A good boy. A really good boy.'
