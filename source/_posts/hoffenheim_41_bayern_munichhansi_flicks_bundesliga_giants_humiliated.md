Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich suffered a devastating defeat to Hoffenheim on Sunday to end their 32-match unbeaten run in all competitions stretching back to last year.

Bayern, winners of the Super Cup against Sevilla after extra time on Thursday, had not lost since December 2019, and had gone 21 consecutive Bundesliga matches without defeat, winning their last 15. 

However, Bayern struggled without star players Robert Lewandowski and Leon Goretzka starting from the off, seeing Hansi Flick lose 4-1 in his 39th competitive game in charge of the club.

The result comes just three days before Bayern face Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup Final, but all is to play for as Lucien Favre's men also suffered a shock 2-0 defeat Augsburg on Saturday. 

The European champions conceded two goals in eight minutes as their usually solid defence collapsed under Hoffenheim pressure. 

Hoffenheim took the lead just 15 minutes into the game through a stunning set piece.

It was Ermin Bicakcic who found space in the very crowded 6-yard box to header home Hoffenheim's corner.

The German underdogs didn't stop there as they punished another defensive error from Bayern just moments later.

After just 24 minutes Hoffenheim secured a two-goal advantage with Mu'nas Dabbur's superb chip over Manuel Neuer.

There was, however, a quick VAR check for offside but the goal was given.

Bayern did manage to pull one back just before the halfway mark after a passage of sharp passing opened up the opportunity for Leroy Sane to find Joshua Kimmich.

Sane provided a deep cross, which saw the ball end up with Kimmich – who curled it into the top right corner.

Nevertheless, Hoffenheim put the icing on the cake late on, with super-sub Ihlas Bebou ploughing down the right hand-side and laying off Andrej Kramaric. 

The 29-year-old took a touch before guiding the ball into to the corner to put another one past deflated Manuel Neuer. 

Kramaric went on to bring his Bundesliga tally up to five goals already this season - after only two games - by scoring Hoffenheim's final goal from the penalty spot.
