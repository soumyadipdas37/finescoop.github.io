Laundry baskets can be big, bulky and awkward to store even when they're empty. So if you struggle to find space in your home for your plastic laundry basket, Amazon shoppers have discovered the perfect solution, and it's bound to become a staple in your day-to-day life.

The ingenious Addis Collapsible Laundry Basket folds down so it's just over three inches high when not in use, making it easier to stow away and carry. It's an essential household item.

Better yet, you don't have to spend a huge sum of money to score the space-saving laundry basket. In fact, it's on sale now with 25 per cent off on Amazon, costing just £14.99.

Now £14.99, the Addis Collapsible Laundry Basket folds down, so it's just over three inches high when not in use

The stylish striped basket has a generous capacity of 45 litres, making it the perfect size for everyday family use. 

Pop this collapsible laundry basket up and then after your clothes are clean, folded, and put away, collapse it down and store under the sink, in a utility room or even on top of the washing machine itself.

If you haven't invested in one yet, the laundry basket has over 900 reviews on Amazon, landing itself a top spot in the Laundry Baskets category. Shoppers say its 'a great invention' and love how it easily collapses 'to hang or slot in a suitable gap after use.'

'What a great product!' one shopper wrote. 'So pleased with my new washing basket! Put a hook on the back of the utility door so can easily store it.

'We haven't had a washing basket for years as they are too big and bulky to store, so when I saw this it was the perfect solution!'.

 Shoppers say its 'a great invention' and love how it easily collapses 'to hang or slot in a suitable gap after use.'

'What is there not to love about this little gem,' said another. 'No more bulky laundry baskets too large to hideaway. 

'This is excellent quality and folds away flat. I have recommended to all my friends. I only wish it was I that had invented it.'

A third shopper added: 'This has made my life so much easier. Whoever thought of this is a bloody genius!! Would recommend to anyone.'

Another favourite is the Beldray Oval Collapsible Laundry Basket (£16.99), which isn't perforated, so it's leakproof and can be used as cooler for beverages at your next party. 

More than 1,600 reviewers have given this laundry basket an average five star rating thanks to its lightweight and convenient fold-down design.
