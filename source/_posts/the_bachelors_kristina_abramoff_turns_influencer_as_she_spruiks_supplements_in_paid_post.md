In a number of photos, the brunette stunner held up a packet of iThrive Nutrition 'Chill Out' supplements, which claim to help with anxiety and stress. 

She disclosed that the post was a 'paid partnership with iThrive' and added in her caption: 'These are my absolutely favourite. The whole range is amazing!' 

The ad comes despite sources claiming that no Bachelor contestants are allowed to share sponsored posts until exactly three months after the season finale airs, as per their contracts.

Earlier this month, the beauty offered proof she has completed her Bachelor's degree amid claims she was a paid actress who only went on the show for fame. 

Sharing a video to her YouTube account, the brunette answered several burning questions during a 12-minute Q&A session about her experience on the reality series. 

'No, I don't have a degree. Absolutely do not have a degree. I just made this up,' she sarcastically told the camera, as she held up her certificate.
