Barcelona will reportedly have to pay £12million (€14million) in order to cancel Luis Suarez's contract.

According to goal, Barcelona will have to pay a significant fee if they are to get Suarez off their books.

Suarez scored 21 goals in 36 games for Barcelona last season but at the age of 33 is very much in the latter stages of his career. He earns around £400,000-a-week.

The Uruguayan has less than a year remaining on his current contract at the Nou Camp.

Koeman is attempting to reshape Barcelona's squad off the back of a season without a trophy which led to the dismissal of his predecessor Quique Setien.

Barcelona's 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League prompted the club's desire for a significant overhaul.

In addition to the Suarez situation, Barcelona are still attempting to address Lionel Messi's future, with the Argentina star eager to leave the club.
