She is a model and body confidence advocate with legions of loyal fans.

And, Iskra Lawrence, 30, exuded happiness as she displayed her post-baby body in a plunging bikini during her birthday getaway to Miraval Austin Resort & Spa, in Austin, Texas at the weekend.

Whilst sitting on a woven hammock in her mishmashed swimwear set, the social media star tilted her head for the eye-popping snaps, which she shared to Instagram on Tuesday.

In addition to her hammock shots, Iskra struck the 'giraffe pose' while standing with the resort's swimming pools in view.

She captioned the series of shots: 'moments from my birthday weekend getaway with my king @philipapayne @miravalresorts. And yes this is the @aerie I mix n match all the time.' 

The happy photographs come after Iskra left almost nothing to the imagination when sharing several nude snaps of herself in the shower on Monday.

Iskra, who turned 30 on Friday, tagged her boyfriend Philip Payne in the jaw-dropping photos, suggesting he took them for her.

Iskra became a first-time mother back in April, when she and Philip welcomed the birth of their baby son.

The model recently admitted that her exercise regime hasn't been 'consistent' since giving birth but said she was 'in awe' that her body has given her the gift of motherhood.

It comes after Iskra detailed the 'pressures' of breastfeeding her baby son in another candid video.

Iskra admitted there have been times when she's had a 'screaming, hungry baby' while being a 'sobbing mess' as she opened up on her anxieties about the process via Instagram.

The body confidence advocate displayed the various different positions she uses to feed her son alongside a lengthy caption.

'Let's just get to the point. Breastfeeding is hard af!' she wrote. 'And it's not ok that so much pressure is put on women to be able to do it. Or that you won't have the same connection if you can't breastfeed - that is BS.

'It's not 'breast is best' it's 'fed is best'. As I shared before my milk supply dropped completely and it was awful. A screaming hungry baby and I was a sobbing mess.

'I wish I wouldn't have put so much pressure on myself surrounding breast feeding. I wish I had a formula ready that my baby liked, and not been afraid of using it.

'When I tried supplementing with formula it really was the biggest relief and will happily do it whenever we need to.

'So this video is me sharing the positions that have worked for us - best latching and most comfortable.'
