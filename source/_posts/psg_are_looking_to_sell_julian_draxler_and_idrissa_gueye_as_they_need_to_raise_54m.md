Paris Saint Germain are looking to offload Julian Draxler and Idrissa Gueye this summer. 

The Ligue 1 club are reportedly looking to raise up to £54million in player sales to offset the financial ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to L'Equipe, PSG are preparing for the £89.1m revenue loss they will experience next season as the 2020-2021 campaign remains behind closed doors.

By balancing their books, PSG will still be able to table offers for their top transfer targets. 

Should PSG sell Draxler and Gueye, they will be able to afford the likes of Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey.  

As it stands, Manchester United have been linked with a move to bring Gueye back to the Premier League.

Reports in France suggest the former Aston Villa and Everton defensive midfielder could be on his way out of Paris Saint-Germain after just one season at the Ligue 1 giants.

The 30-year-old signed for Aston Villa from Lille for £9m back in the summer of 2015 before moving on to Everton a year later. After impressing in 108 appearances for the Toffees over the course of three seasons he signed for PSG for £30m last July.

However, PSG sporting director Leonardo is now keen to get Gueye off their books this summer.

Subsequently, United are said to be interesting in submitting an offer for the Senegal international but according to Le10Sports the Red Devils will face competition from fellow admirers Wolves.

While Draxler is said to be less inclined to leave the French capital as he wishes to see out the remaining year remaining on his contract at the Parc des Princes, despite being told he will not be involved in Thomas Tuchel’s plans.
