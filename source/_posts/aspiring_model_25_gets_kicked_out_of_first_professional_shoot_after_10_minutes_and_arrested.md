An aspiring model was arrested by police after she was kicked out of her first professional shoot after ten minutes for drinking half a bottle to calm her nerves. 

Amy Enright, 25, was given vouchers to take part in a modelling shoot at a Manchester photography studio, but became so 'overwhelmed' that she drank vodka in the dressing room whilst getting ready.

Police were called to the unnamed studio at Stevenson Square, in Manchester's trendy Northern Quarter, on August 5.

Amy Enright, 25, was arrested at an unnamed studio in Manchester's Northern Quarter just after 10am on August 5 after drinking half a bottle of vodka to calm her nerves

Enright was asked to leave after 10 minutes because she was so intoxicated that the stylist was unable to do her hair and makeup, Manchester magistrates court heard

After arriving at the studio at 10.20am, Enright was so intoxicated that the stylist was unable to do her hair and makeup, Manchester magistrates court heard.

She was asked to leave after just ten minutes because she was slurring her words and struggling to sit upright for photos.

Officers asked Enright for details, including her phone number, but she could barely string a sentence together and gave letters instead of numbers. 

Enright later claimed she 'rarely leaves home' due to an anxiety condition and had drunk half a bottle of vodka since breakfast.

An unnamed child she was looking after was taken to relatives.

Enright, who lives with her parents in Sale near Altrincham, sobbed in court and admitted to being drunk in charge of a child. 

The 25-year-old was fined £120 and ordered to pay £119 in costs and surcharges.

The aspiring model, who is currently on furlough from an undisclosed part time job, regularly posts selfies on Facebook and has 1,300 followers on her Instagram page.

Prosecutor Peter Conoray said: 'When she arrived at 10.20am she initially appeared to be okay and did not smell of alcohol or appear intoxicated at all. But from the point that she sat down to get prepared for the shoot, she was asking to go in and out of the private changing room.'

Enright claimed she 'rarely leaves home' due to an anxiety condition and panic attacks, and had drunk half a bottle of vodka since breakfast

Mr Conoray added that after being asked to leave, Enright returned a couple of minutes later because she had forgotten some of her belongings.

He said: 'Workers contacted the police as they were concerned for the welfare of the child.

'Police attended and saw the defendant and straight away on the first indication could see she was very unsteady and seemed to be confused as to why the police wanted to speak.

'They asked where she had been and the defendant confirmed she had been at a photoshoot and pointed in the complete opposite direction to where the studio was. Her speech was very slurred and she was struggling to string a complete sentence together.'

Enright first told officers her last drink was at 1am but then said around 6 or 7am when she was asked again. Officers found half a bottle of vodka when searching her bag.  

In mitigation defence lawyer Karl Benson said: 'The defendant rarely leaves her house and has recently separated from her partner. She was given a voucher for a photo studio to have some photos taken but she didn't feel she would be able to leave the house to go to the place and unfortunately drank before. She went to the appointment and was taken by her mother who took her in the car.'

Mr Benson added that the 'defendant is not an alcoholic and does not drink every day', arguing that drinking on this occasion was because she did not 'feel capable or going out' to the studio.

He said: 'She's very introverted and has no friends and doesn't go out and she made a mistake by having alcohol.

'She feels so much shame and she can't express she's so remorseful for that. She has been having dreams in regards to her biggest concern which is the reporting of this matter and it being out there and local people would look at her and that has caused her some distress.'

Mr Benson said that Enright has social anxiety disorder, extreme anxiety and panic attacks, describing her as a 'very vulnerable young lady' who is eager to get help. 

JP Larry Collier told Enright: 'This was a relatively serious offence. The police described you as being very unsteady on your feet and confused and smelling of alcohol which indicated to us that you were drunk.

'I'm not going to go into a lecture but you do have a duty of care when you are with a child and you have failed in that duty.'
