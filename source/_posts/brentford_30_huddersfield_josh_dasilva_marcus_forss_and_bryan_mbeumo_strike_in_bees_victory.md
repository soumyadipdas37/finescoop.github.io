Brentford's BMW has been consigned to the scrapheap but Thomas Frank’s side are back up and running after the acceleration and drive of defender Rico Henry set them on the road for an opening victory at pastures new.

As their first Championship game away from Griffin Park veered towards frustration, Henry’s tireless run and precise pull-back allowed Josh Dasilva to break the deadlock against Huddersfield. Then, late on, Marcus Forss’ close-range finish and a rocket from Bryan Mbeumo helped Brentford christen their shining new home in style.

It means Huddersfield’s own new era under Carlos Corberan begins with three defeats. So much for the former Leeds coach sprinkling their Yorkshire rivals with some Bielsa stardust. Their wait for a first point and goal of the campaign goes on. But cutting edge eluded Brentford, too, until Henry exchanged passes with Sergi Canos and set off down the left.

Frank’s side seemed to be missing Ollie Watkins and the absent Said Benrahma, with Mbeumo and new striker Ivan Toney both guilty of spurning opportunities. The visitors, meanwhile, lost defenders Christopher Schindler and Harry Toffolo to first-half injuries but stayed on terms until Dasilva fired home from the edge of the box. That goal opened Brentford’s account here and came courtesy of helping hands - first from Henry and then from a slight deflection which deceived goalkeeper Ben Hamer.Huddersfield pushed for an equaliser – Juninho Bacuna‘s header struck a post – before Forss profited from Mbeumo’s neat feet inside the area.

The French winger then added cherry to cake, firing beyond Hamer from 18 yards.
