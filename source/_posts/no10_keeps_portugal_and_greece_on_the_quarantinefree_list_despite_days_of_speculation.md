The Government has decided to keep Portugal and Greece on the quarantine-free list, despite days of speculation over soaring cases sparking holidaymakers to make a scramble home tonight. 

Following a week of speculation, the Transport Minister tweeted today: 'We continue to keep the Travel Corridor list under constant review & won't hesitate to remove countries if needed. 

'However, there are no English additions or removals today. 

'Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can & do change at very short notice.'

There has been widespread speculation this week that Portugal could be added to the UK's quarantine list - but today Grant Shapps has announced there will be no changes 

Sources told MailOnline that although Portugal was above the 'trigger' threshold for cases per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, that appeared to be because they were carrying out more tests.

'The rate of positives per test has actually gone down,' one senior source said. 

More to follow. 



The rate of coronavirus cases per 100,000 of population in Greece over the past seven days is just 14 - well short of the government's quarantine threshold of 20
