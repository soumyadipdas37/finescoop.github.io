Her love life became the focus of heightened speculation over the weekend, when she was spotted enjoying a night out with The Crown's Matt Smith in London.

But Emilia Clarke only had eyes for another on Monday, when she took her beloved pet pooch for a stroll in the park as they made the most of the late summer sunshine.

The Game of Thrones star, 33, looked casually cool for the London outing, donning a pink hoodie, which she teamed with black leggings and white running shoes.
