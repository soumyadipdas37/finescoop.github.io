She is known for flaunting her amazing physique on social media. 

But, on Friday Vanessa Sierra, 25, poked fun at herself sharing a hilarious 'Instagram versus reality' post to Instagram. 

The Love Island star flaunted her taught torso in a sultry photograph before sharing a hilarious picture of what she looks like in 'reality'.

She wore her long locks loose and had a full face of make-up  including a smokey eye and a pink pout.

'Instagram VS reality which one do u prefer?' She captioned the pictures.  

The post comes after Vanessa's Instagram account was disabled last month after she re-posted a video that got taken down from the social media platform.  

'I've been cancelled from Instagram. I actually know what I did wrong, I shouldn't have done it,' she said in a YouTube video at the time.

I just re-posted it 'cause I thought it was nothing. Yeah, it showed my butt in it, but it wasn't sexual.'  

She has since created a new account which has already gained 84,800 followers.    

'My main acc got disabled at 850k. Follow me here until I (hopefully) get it back,' she has written in the bio.
