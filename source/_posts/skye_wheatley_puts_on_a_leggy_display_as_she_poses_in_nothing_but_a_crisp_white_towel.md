She's no stranger to flaunting her sensational curves on social media. 

But on Sunday, Skye Wheatley decided to cover up in her latest Instagram post. 

The 26-year-old stunner looked serene as she posed in a crisp white towel in a minimalist bathroom, decked out in gold fittings.

The former Big Brother babe looked relaxed as she seductively posed against a bathroom cabinet. 

Skye looked radiant as she sported a face full of makeup which consisted of foundation, lipgloss and dark eye colouring.  

She kept her hair simple for the impromptu photo shoot, tying it back in an always-chic bun.

Alongside a photo collage of the pair together, she wrote: 'Happy Father's Day to my best friend full of gas (been coping [sic] about 3-4 farts in the space of an hour from this guy). 

'And to most adoring, loving and caring father. Watching you be the best daddaaa to forest warms my heart.

'Thanks for making an effort to put the washing machine on even though you've stained all my whites with a direct hit of softener, cleaning the kitchen when I'm too exhausted and making sure Forest is never in a wet nappy.

'I love you stinky man. Time to get mine and Forest's name tattooed on that sexy dad bod,' she concluded.   

The blonde beauty went on to insist the comments were just 'banter' and fans should not be upset by them. 

The influencer welcomed her first child Forest with boyfriend Lachlan in December 2018.
