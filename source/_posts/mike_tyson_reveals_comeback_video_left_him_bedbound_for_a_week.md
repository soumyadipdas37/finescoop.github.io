Boxing legend Mike Tyson has revealed the incredible exhaustion he suffered in the wake of his stunning comeback video earlier this year.

Iron Mike rocked the world of boxing during lockdown by announcing that he would return to the ring at the age of 54 for a bout against Roy Jones Jr on November 28.

At the time, he posted a clip on social media of himself in incredible shape, working out on the pads before turning to the camera and claiming 'I'm back'.

Tyson was speaking to Joe Rogan for a podcast episode when he made the startling revelation

While the clip was incredibly impressive, Tyson has now revealed that the exertion left him bed-bound for a week in the aftermath.

Speaking to Joe Rogan on his podcast, Tyson explained: 'Getting in shape and getting conditioned are two different animals. They don't even belong in the same division of working out. Getting in shape is getting able to fit in your clothes.

'Being in condition is being able to come outside of your soul. You can't do that automatically. The emotional state to prepare for that is mind-boggling.Â 

The incredible boxing video took its toll on the 54-year-old boxing legend, he has admitted

'Let me tell you something about the first training video, I did that video and I was in bed for a week. That was 30 seconds, and I was in bed for a week. That was not funny because it made me realise that this is big boy s***.'

Tyson has not fought professionally since 2005, when he lost out to Kevin McBride in his final bout.

Tyson's opponent for November's fight, Jones Jr, meanwhile, has only been inactive since 2018, where he won via unanimous decision against Scott Sigmon.
