West Ham and Newcastle United have approached Bologna for Japan International Takehiro Tomiyasu. 

The Magpies are interested in signing the right-back as a potential replacement for DeAndre Yedlin, who could leave United this summer, while David Moyes is looking to sure up his defensive options for next season.

The Ligue 1 club are reportedly looking to raise up to £54million in player sales to offset the financial ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic.

Chelsea have signed young goalkeeping sensation Teddy Sharman-Lowe from Burton Albion on a permanent deal.

It has also been revealed that the 17-year-old will spend next season on loan with the League One outfit to help further his development as part of the switch.

Bayer Leverkusen have expressed surprise interest in signing Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin, according to reports.

The 25-year-old has also been the subject of a £30million bid from Paris Saint-Germain, and Arsenal are understood to recognise that any substantial fee will allow them to reinvest.

Newcastle are reportedly considering loan moves for Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah and Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster this summer. 

Steve Bruce has lost Dwight Gayle to a knee injury until at least December and only Andy Carroll has featured in recent warm-up matches for Newcastle. 

Barcelona are 'ramping up their pursuit' of Lyon attacker Memphis Depay as a replacement for Luis Suarez.

With the Uraguayan set to leave the Nou Camp, Ronald Koeman is very keen on bringing a new striker into the club.

Barcelona are reportedly considering a move for ex-player Thiago Alcantara this summer, but new boss Ronald Koeman prefers a pursuit of Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum. 

Bayern Munich playmaker Thiago, who is currently on international duty with Spain, has just a year left on his contract and has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League, with Liverpool and Manchester United interested. 

Juventus could turn back the clock as Andrea Pirlo is reportedly interested in bringing Alvaro Morata back to the club.

The new Juventus boss is very keen on signing a striker during the summer transfer window and has been heavily linked with Barcelona star Luis Suarez. 

Christian Eriksen has sensationally been placed on the transfer list by Inter Milan just a matter of months after his move to Italy. For an offer of around £35million, the Serie A giants would be willing to allow the playmaker to leave.

The preferred 3-5-2 formation of Antonio Conte has often forced Eriksen to settle for a spot on the sidelines, and the enigmatic Italian coach is certain he can lead the club back to glory should they grant him his wishes this summer.

Newcastle United’s £20mIllion offer for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has been accepted, Sportsmail understands.

Jamie Carragher says that if Manchester United don't sign Jadon Sancho this summer they risk losing him to Liverpool next year.

Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi will reportedly be offered a new contract at Stamford Bridge this summer, before heading out on loan with a number of Premier League clubs interested in the Belgian. 

Batshuayi was handed chances in the first-team last season under Frank Lampard, but after Timo Werner joined during this window, the 26-year-old is now further down the pecking order up front and is effectively fourth-choice behind Werner, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud.
