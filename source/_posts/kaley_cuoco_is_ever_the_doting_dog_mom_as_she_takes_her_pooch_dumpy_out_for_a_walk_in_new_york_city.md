She's finally been able to complete production on her followup to The Big Bang Theory.

And Kaley Cuoco was spotted being ever the doting dog mom in New York City on Tuesday, while out for a walk with her adopted senior pooch Dumpy.

The actress, 34, was dressed down in athletic wear for the outing, with her blond hair pulled back in a messy ponytail.

She wore a black sleeveless Gold Sheep top, paired with matching Alo bicycle shorts.

On her feet, the 8 Simple Rules star wore what appeared to be white slippers.

As with all other projects, production was stalled on the show in the spring as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.   

And just the night before her dog walk sighting, Cuoco was seen on the set of the new series, shooting exteriors in downtown Manhattan.

The new dramatic thriller will follow the titular flight attendant (Cuoco) as she wakes up hungover in a hotel room in Dubai, with a dead body lying next to her – and no recollection of the night before.
