Richard Madden was seen in London with his actor pal Froy Gutierrez, after returning to the UK from LA where the pair allegedly spent lockdown together.

The Bodyguard star, 34, and the Teen Wolf actor, 22, chatted amicably as they took out the bins before they got into the car for a drive on Thursday.

Keeping safe amid the coronavirus pandemic, Richard wore a black face mask that also helped him keep a low profile as they left their accommodation.

Last month Richard spent time at a country estate in Scotland, where he caught up with fellow acting friends Lily James, Dominic Cooper and Gemma Chan during a rural group holiday.

It was believed that Richard stayed in the Blair Atholl area of Scotland, a village in Perthshire known for its rustic stone buildings and scenic landscape.  

The quartet shared an array of photos via Instagram from the trip but it was unclear if Froy was also with them, as some fans claimed he was seen in London at the time.

It was reported earlier this year that Richard was spending isolation in a lavish £20,000 a month LA property with Froy.

Richard was believed to be living in fellow Emilia Clarke's two-bedroom home after moving out of the house he shared with Brandon Flynn last year. 

He was first photographed with the Teen Wolf star, who is from Texas, in February. 

Richard previously lived with 13 Reasons Why actor Brandon, 26, until they had a falling out in November last year.  

According to The Sun, Richard and Froy were holed up in the luxury LA pad during the coronavirus pandemic.

Amicable: Richard and Froy seemed to be in good spirits as they went on their drive

Brandon and Richard allegedly drifted apart after Brandon asked bosses at fashion brand Versace not to invite Richard to an event they were throwing at the end of last year, reports the website. 

A source told the publication: 'Richard and Brandon bonded over being up-and-coming actors in the industry and decided to share a place while both working in LA. 

'But they have fallen out in the past few months and have cut ties with each other.

'Brandon has made it clear he doesn’t want to see Richard because he asked the team at Versace not to invite him to a party they are having at the beginning of December.' 

The news of the pair moving out came after Richard dodged a question about his relationship with Brandon after it was implied they were more than just friends.  

During an interview with the New York Times to promote his role in Rocketman, Richard said: 'I just keep my personal life personal. I've never talked about my relationships.'
