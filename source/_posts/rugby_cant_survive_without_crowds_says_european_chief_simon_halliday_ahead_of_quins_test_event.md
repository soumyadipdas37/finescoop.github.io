European Rugby chief Simon Halliday has warned that the sport cannot continue without crowds — and he wants fans to return for this month’s quarter-final at Sandy Park.

Clubs are losing millions of pounds per week and Covid-19 could have an even greater impact on the community game. 

Saturday's Premiership fixture between Harlequins and Bath is being used as a trial event, which Halliday hopes could pave the way for crowds at the Champions Cup.

European Rugby chief Simon Halliday claims rugby simply cannot continue without fans

‘We massively respect the protocols in place but I believe people in positions of authority in the sporting world have got to keep asking the question,’ said Halliday. 

‘The game simply cannot continue if we don’t get crowds back in. That is clear. From a European club perspective, clubs generate a serious amount of revenue from these matches.

‘I don’t want to think about the potential impact of no crowds in the Six Nations. That revenue filters down to the grassroots games — that’s what’s at stake.

‘Harlequins have been asked to do a trial. If we get a great outcome from that, why would you not try to get some kind of crowd into the Exeter v Northampton quarter-final? 

‘Can we get fans in at two weeks’ notice? I should hope so. I’m sure we could respond quickly so it’s important to keep it on the agenda. It’s critical.’

Halliday has ruled out Twickenham as a venue for this year’s Champions Cup final

Marseille have already pulled out of hosting this year’s Champions Cup final. An alternative venue is yet to be selected, with the host stadium dependent on which teams make the final. 

However, Halliday has ruled out Twickenham, leaving Ashton Gate and the Ricoh Arena as the leading contenders if an English club progresses.

‘In every country, there are stadiums we’ve earmarked,’ said Halliday. ‘It depends on the participants. We’ve got the Kingspan or the Aviva in Ireland. In England it definitely won’t be Twickenham but we’re considering Ashton Gate or the Ricoh.’
