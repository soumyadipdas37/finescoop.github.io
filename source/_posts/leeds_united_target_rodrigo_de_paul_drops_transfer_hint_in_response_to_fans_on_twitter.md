Rodrigo De Paul dropped a Twitter hint that his long-anticipated transfer to Leeds United is moving closer - before deleting the message.

The Argentina attacking midfielder, who plays in Italy for Udinese, has been linked with a switch to Elland Road for some time.

Newly-promoted Leeds played superbly against reigning champions Liverpool in their Premier League opener on Saturday but Marcelo Bielsa is still looking to strengthen his squad.

The Argentine appeared to confirm on Twitter that talks are ongoing over his move to Leeds

And having already signed the forward Rodrigo from Valencia, Bielsa is now keen on signing his 26-year-old namesake before the window closes.

It seems De Paul is keen to move to Yorkshire as well, replying to a Twitter post by Leeds fanzine The Square Ball.

They wrote 'Apparently he's keen on the move but it now rests with the clubs' to which De Paul replied 'Yes' with a fingers crossed emoji.

De Paul later deleted the tweet but not before causing a stir among The Square Ball's followers.

Udinese want £37million for De Paul, which is higher than the Premier League club's valuation but negotiations are ongoing it would seem.

Aside from the forward Rodrigo, Leeds have also signed the Germany international centre-back Robin Koch from Freiburg and made permanent the loans of Helder Costa and Illan Meslier.

Jack Harrison has also signed for a third season on loan from Manchester City.
