Katie Piper has made her first appearance as a presenter on Songs Of Praise where she spoke to a farmer whose wife took her own life after a battle with mental health. 

The TV personality, 36, spoke to semi-retired farmer David Brooke, who ran a farm for more than 25 years in Carmarthenshire, Wales, before his wife Cathy died in 2015.  

Katie revealed how she felt a 'sense of healing through God' as she learned about the scheme that David volunteers with which helps to support farmers during difficulty.

The mother-of-two was seen walking through a farm in wellies as she learned of the importance of the helpline for famers in the programme which aired on Sunday. 

Katie said: 'At this time of year the pressure for a good harvest for some farmers can make or break them.

'And when they fear that they can't get through - this is when they need someone to turn to.'

The philanthropist spoke to The Venerable Eileen Davis who started the Tir Dewi scheme in West Wales to help farmers 'facing times of crisis'. 

Welcoming Katie into the church, she explained: 'Agriculture today is one of the industries today that sees the greatest number of unfortunately suicides because of the fact of rural isolation.' 

Katie later met with David who she described 'knows the pressures only too well' of managing a farm and a large family. 

Speaking to Katie, the father-of-four said: 'Cath wasn't very happy and my work was very demanding. We had been short of money a bit and it had been quite tough to raise a large family.'

'She just seemed to spiral down and down and I don't seem to know what actually caused it.' 

He added: 'She rallied and she seemed fine and then gradually I think life got too much for her again.' 

Speaking about the scheme, he said: 'When Cath died I thought I would like to do something to help.

'Men are very reluctant to talk about their feelings and farmers are not very good at communicating either.' 

Earlier this month Katie told the BBC how she was 'thrilled to be joining the Songs Of Praise team'.  

Songs of Praise producer Matthew Napier said: 'When we first filmed with Katie we heard her eloquently express her faith and the important role it played at a difficult time of her life.'

Katie is mother to daughter Belle, six, and Penelope, two, who she shares with her husband Richard Sutton after the couple married in 2015. 

She suffered life-altering burns after being doused in sulphuric acid by Stefan Sylvestre in a horrific acid attack in 2008, which was orchestrated by her jealous ex-boyfriend David Lynch.

She endured significant damage to her face including her eye which forced her to have a skin graft last month to have her lid replaced after struggling to open it.
