If you are unable to send snaps in Snapchat - you are not alone.

The social media platform appears to be down for users in the US and parts of Europe, with many reporting issues with sending pr receiving snaps.

The outage seems to have started around 11:30am ET and quickly spike to more than 47,000 reports on DownDetector.com.

All parts of the US are experiencing problems, while over in Europe the  UK and parts of The Netherlands are shown in red on DownDetector's map.



Snapchat quickly acknowledged the issues on Twitter sharing: ' We're aware some Snapchatters are having trouble using the app. We are looking into it and working on a fix!' 

Thousands flocked to DownDetector, which monitors issues that may arise with online platforms and services, to share the problems they are experiencing using the app. 

The majority of complaints were aimed at sending snaps, but others are also unable to receive them.

DownDetector's map shows major cities in the US are mostly affected, including New York City on the east, Minneapolis to the North, Dallas in the south and San Francisco to the West.

Users on the other side of the Atlantic are also experiencing problems with Snapchat.

The map shows London, The Netherlands,  parts of Norway and Sweden area shown in red- meaning they are effected.

Just when one social media platform goes down, another one is flooded with users seeing if anyone else has been hit or it may be an issue with their own Wifi or smartphone.

However, some users are criticizing those claiming Snapchat is down, as it is 9/11 in America.

Others shared their frustration of waiting to send a snap with memes.

The last time Snapchat experienced an outage was in April, which effect tens of thousands of users in the US and parts of Europe.

Snapchat and other social media apps became essentials this year, as much of the world spent months in some kind of coronavirus lockdown.

The firm reported a ‘all-time high’ surge in activity over the past month, noting that time spent on video and voice calling via that app was up more than 50 percent in late March compared to February.
