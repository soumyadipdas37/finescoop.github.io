Police say Fredrick Elrezz became physically aggressive towards two NSW Corrective Services officers, about 9.30am last Thursday, before biting one on the hand and spitting on the other.

The 32-year-old has been charged with three new offences including assaulting a law enforcement officer and inflicting actual bodily harm.

Elrezz was last week accused of assaulting three policemen on York Street on Wednesday after he was said to have harassed a food delivery driver.

The Lakemba man's lawyer, Oussama Elfawal, last Friday told magistrate Robert Williams at Central Local Court his client was having a 'difficult time' in custody.

'He has been subject to violence from the guards because of the allegations made against him,' Mr Elfawal told the court.

Elrezz was taken to hospital for assessment after the slashing incident, while authorities also seized several items from a York Street hostel.

A 40-year-old senior constable was treated for a laceration to his head and a cut to his left shoulder, while two other officers were also taken to hospital.

Elrezz was charged with a string of offences including inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, assaulting police and resisting arrest.

The 32-year-old faced magistrate Michael Crompton on Wednesday via video link at Bankstown Local Court, where did not apply for bail and it was formally refused.

He will next face court at the Sydney Downing Centre Local Court on October 21.
