He's been living with his Love Island girlfriend Molly-Mae Hague ever since they left the Mallorcan villa last year.

But Tommy Fury enjoyed a brief break away from his partner as he tucked into some ice cream alongside his father John in Hale Cheshire on Sunday afternoon.

The boxer, 21, cut a casual figure as he sported a form-fitting black T-shirt, teamed with a pair of white shorts. 

Just the two of us: Tommy Fury enjoyed a brief break away from his partner Molly-Mae Hague as he tucked into some ice cream alongside his father John in Hale Cheshire on Sunday 

Opting for a sporty display when it came to his footwear, the sportsman rounded things off with box-fresh trainers and a plain watch.

Boxing cornerman John, 56, looked equally low-key in a grey top, blue shorts and a dark baseball cap.

Earlier this week, his love Molly-Mae, also 21, revealed she's been forced to avoid her Twitter account after getting trolled over her £8,000 social media giveaway.

The reality star took to Instagram to share she was giving away a massive haul of goods – including Louis Vuitton bags – as she celebrates garnering 1million YouTube subscribers.

However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.

As the complaints ramped up on the micro-blogging site, the influencer clapped back, wryly tweeting: '£10 to any boy that’s not tweeted ‘£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae’s giveaway’..... terms and conditions apply x.' 

However, on Saturday, Molly-Mae admitted she'd all but given up on the platform, in a video shared with her fans on her Instagram Stories.

She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always.

Clapping back: As the complaints about her giveaway clogging up Instagram feeds, the reality star and influencer clapped back with a wry tweet

'I'm one of those people that do tend to read things and I do tend to let it get to me.

'But I just made this giveaway for something for us all to enjoy together, a way that we can celebrate having a million subscribers together and also a way for me to give back was the main thing.

'I wouldn't have any of this stuff without you guys, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I do.

'Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.'
