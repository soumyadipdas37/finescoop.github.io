It's been four years since surfing legend Mick Fanning suffered a terrifying encounter with a great white shark. 

And while the 39-year-old has worked hard to deal with the mental anguish that came after the incident, his mates haven't made the healing process easy.  

Speaking to The Kyle And Jackie O show on Thursday, Mick admitted his surfing buddies sometimes prank him by pretending there's a shark in the water

'I freak out': Surfer Mick Fanning, 39, has admitted his friends sometimes mock him at the beach by splashing behind him and shouting, 'Shark! Shark!' - even though he's battling PTSD after his 2015 shark attack  

'It still took me about a year or so to get through my PTSD. Even still, I'm very wary of what's in the ocean. People splash behind me, I freak out. My mate do it to me all the time,' he explained.  

Shocked, Kyle Sandilands queried: 'Does anyone ever yell 'Shark! Shark!' when you're out there? And do you think, 'Listen, don't do that'? 

'Yeah there's a few here that do that,' Mick replied dryly. 

'I had to go through and deal with things in my own personal life': Earlier in the interview, Mick spoke about the long healing process following the shark attack, admitting it took him 'a year or so' to get through his post-traumatic stress disorder

'[After the shark attack] I had to go through and deal with things in my own personal life to make sure I was in a spot where I was comfortable with going surfing again,' he explained.    

It comes after Mick explained to The Australian why he still 'freaks' out whenever somebody splashes behind him in the water.

'I mean, it's like I'm in the actual position I was in, it's a reality dream,' the three-times world champion said.

'You sort of learn your body can do so many things to make things real and not real and I just had to learn, 'OK, that moment's been done. It's not real. These dreams are just coming back'.'

'I thought I was going to die': He managed to survive by kicking and punching the beast in the nose

'I thought I was going to die. I guess everyone watching on from the beach that day, and on the live broadcast all over the world, thought the exact same thing,' he told  Stellar in April 2019. 

Meanwhile, Mick is hot on the promotions trail for his new National Geographic documentary Save This Shark on September 15. 

The two-part series follows Mick as he conquers his fear of the animal by exploring  shark conservation and new technologies helping humans and sharks safely co-exist. 

'It was a really personal journey for me to be able to reconnect with sharks in this way,' Mick said in a statement.
