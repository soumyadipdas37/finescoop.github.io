DailyMail.com also revealed that Vitolo broke it off with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text when handsy photos of him and Holmes were first published, leaving the handbag designer shocked and forcing her to move back home.

The two were introduced by mutual friends and their fling has intensified since the actress returned to NYC this summer after quarantining with her family in Ohio, according to a source close to the actress.

The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with Foxx, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.

The insider said: 'Maybe she's just enjoying this fling because she's had such a hard six years with Jamie.'
