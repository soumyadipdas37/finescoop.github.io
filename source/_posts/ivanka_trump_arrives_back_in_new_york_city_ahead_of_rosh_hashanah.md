Ivanka Trump was pictured arriving at her Manhattan apartment last night, marking the first time that she has been photographed in New York City since the pandemic hit the US earlier this year.

The 38-year-old cut a casual figure as she made the short walk from her SUV to the front door on Thursday evening, dressed down in dark skinny jeans and a light gray sweatshirt — and she was spotted again Friday morning as she dropped her son Joseph off at his grandparents' home.

While Jared is still in Washington, D.C. and kids Arabella and Theodore have not yet been spotted in New York, Ivanka's arrival comes in time for the start of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sundown tonight.

Going in: The 38-year-old cut a casual figure as she made the short walk from her SUV to the front door on Thursday evening, arriving a day before the start of Rosh Hashanah 

Carrying her things: She brought along a small suitcase and a Dior dress bag, which others carried inside for her. Ivanka just toted her purse, from which papers and a charger stuck out

Outfit: She was dressed down in dark skinny jeans and a light gray sweatshirt and accessorized with a pair of plain black flats, a simple white bag, and a printed pink face mask

Ivanka was somewhat low-profile — or as low-profiled as a person can be in a convoy of three Secret Service vehicles with seven Secret Service agents — as she walked into her Park Avenue home at sundown on Thursday evening.

Along with her unfussy outfit, the First Daughter accessorized with a pair of plain black flats, a simple white bag, and a printed pink face mask.

She wore her hair down and straight as she briskly walked from her car to the building.

She brought along a small suitcase and a Dior dress bag, which others carried inside for her.

On Friday morning, she was photographed yet again, this time leaving the apartment to take six-year-old Joseph to his grandparents' home. 

Ivanka donned the same jeans, shoes, and bag for the errand, but switched up her top, ditching the gray sweater for a short-sleeve black mock-turtleneck.

Mask swap: The White House advisor wore her hair down and minimal makeup on her face again, and traded in yesterday's pink mask for a plain black one

Kid clothes: She was pictured getting out of her SUV with Joseph, who himself was dressed casually in a blue sweater, gray sweats, sneakers, and a colorful mask

Keeping him occupied: The little boy carried was appeared to be a small bag of snacks and a bright pink toy microphone

Family: Jared Kushner was pictured at the family's Kalorama home this morning, and the whereabouts of the couple's other two children are unknown

The White House advisor wore her hair down and minimal makeup on her face again, and traded in yesterday's pink mask for a plain black one.

She also accessorized with a blue watch and held a newspaper in her hand.

The little boy carried was appeared to be a small bag of snacks and a bright pink toy microphone as he headed in to see his grandparents.

Meanwhile, dad Jared Kushner was pictured at the family's Kalorama home this morning, and the whereabouts of the couple's other two children are unknown.

However, they may all come together by tonight for the start of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, which begins at sundown and will herald in the new year of 5781. 

Ivanka has not been photographed in New York City since the beginning of the pandemic in the US, though she did stay at the family's New Jersey home for Passover in April.

Pitstop: Ivanka surprised volunteers at the Latinos for Trump headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday 

Outfit: She wore a $1,250 dress by Colombian fashion designer Johanna Ortiz 

Busy bee: After she left Arizona, she flew to Austin, Texas, for another event 

Her trip to New York comes at the end of a week of traveling while campaigning for her father.

On Wednesday, she surprised volunteers at the Latinos for Trump headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, wearing a $1,250 dress by Colombian fashion designer Johanna Ortiz and a tie-dye pastel face mask.

She walked around the headquarters with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, waving and speaking to volunteers — and at one point, she gave the woman she was talking to a fist bump. 

After her visit, she sat down with Gov. Ducey and others to participate in a roundtable discussion about America's working families.  

Ivanka's trip to Arizona marked the first time the first daughter has visited the state since her father was elected, but that wasn't her only visit for the day.

After she left Arizona, she flew to Austin, Texas, where she participated in a fundraising event for her father's campaign.

Into it: Ivanka Trump learned how to roll out dough for Cuban bread while visiting La Segunda Bakery in Tampa, Florida, on Thursday 

Outfit of the day: The 38-year-old donned a light blue and white patterned dress with billowy sleeves and a matching Lele Sadoughi pinstriped face mask adorned with pearls

Next stop: Ivanka later joined former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at Columbia Restaurant for a 'fireside chat' about small businesses

All smiles: The White House senior adviser flashed the peace sign before sitting down 

On Thursday, she flew to Tampa, Florida, where she visited La Segunda Bakery in Ybor City and tried her hand at making Cuban bread with baker Anthony Ali.

She wore a light blue and white patterned dress with billowy sleeves and a matching Lele Sadoughi pinstriped face mask adorned with pearls.     

Jennifer Holton, a reporter for FOX13 News, tweeted that Ivanka had 'ordered three loaves of Cuban bread and guava pastries from La Segunda to bring back home to DC tonight.'

Ivanka remained perfectly coiffed after her bread-making lesson, with not one blonde hair out of place when she headed to her next stop: Columbia Restaurant.

President Donald Trump's eldest daughter joined former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at the establishment, which is the oldest restaurant in the state.

They sat down with other local leaders for an intimate 'fireside chat.'

Ivanka removed her mask for the conversation and sat slightly less than six feet apart from Bondi as they discussed the effect of COVID-19 on small businesses, among other things.
