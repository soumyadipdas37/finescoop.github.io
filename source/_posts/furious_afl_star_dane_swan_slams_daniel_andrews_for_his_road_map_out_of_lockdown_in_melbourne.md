AFL legend Dane Swan has taken aim at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews after he extended Melbourne's stage four lockdown by two weeks. 

Mr Andrews on Sunday unveiled his much-anticipated four-step roadmap to ease the nation's toughest coronavirus restrictions.

Under the plan, Melbourne's stage four restrictions will remain in place for another two weeks, though from September 14 the nightly curfew will start an hour later at 9pm and run until 5am.

Swan took to Twitter to air his frustrations at the embattled premier, who has come under fire for his handling of Victoria's second COVID-19 wave. 

'This motherf**ker is really wearing on my patience,' the former Collingwood star tweeted during Mr Andrews' lengthy press conference on Sunday afternoon.

'Gonna be a LOT of fines coming the government's way the next couple months. The rule breaking is gonna get a lot worse whether anyone likes it or not.

'You reckon @DanielAndrewsMP is checking his mentions today? Be a brave boy cause I'd imagine not a head a superlatives coming his way and would of all been avoided if he had of not bungled hotel quarantine. Ahh well.'

Mr Andrews faced a parliamentary inquiry last month into Melbourne's bungled hotel quarantine, where security guards were contracted and subsequently spread the virus back into the community ahead of the state's second wave.

Under the Andrews Government's roadmap plan, people living alone will be able to nominate a friend or family member who can visit them.

Two hours of daily exercise will be allowed, including 'social interactions' such as having a picnic at a local park or reading a book at the beach.

The curfew won't be lifted until October 26, with people able to leave their homes for non-essential reasons.

The lockdown will only lift on that date if the average number of new cases falls below five and there are fewer than five unknown source cases.

Up to five visitors from a nominated household and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people will also be allowed.

'We can't run out of lockdown. We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown to find that COVID normal,' Mr Andrews said on Sunday.

'I want a Christmas that is as close to normal as possible and this is the only way, these steps are the only way that we will get to that point.'

The premier said the nominated 14-day average of five cases provided a 97 per cent chance of avoiding having to go back into lockdown.

Victoria's average daily number of cases during the previous 14 days was about 100.

'If you open up at that level you are not open for long,' he said.

The last step will come into effect from November 23, if Victoria goes 14 days with no new cases, allowing public gatherings of up to 50 people and 20 home visitors at a time.

All remaining restrictions will be removed when Victoria goes 28 days with no new cases, although masks will likely remain compulsory for some time. 

Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra was among a chorus of critics who said the plan did not do enough to protect struggling businesses.

'We were hoping for a road to recovery. Today we have been delivered a road to nowhere,' he said.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison took a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Andrews for extending Melbourne's  lockdown, claiming better health care trumps tough restrictions. 

'The continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting mental health,' a statement from Mr Morrison, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Health Minister Greg Hunt read.

Mr Morrison said it is of 'critical importance' that Victoria's contact tracing is strengthened to the 'highest level possible'. 

'In NSW, this has enabled the Berejiklian Government to respond to multiple outbreaks while permitting businesses and people to carry out their daily lives in a CovidSafe way,' the statement read. 

'Restrictions are not substitutes for strengthening health systems to cope with the virus, especially when community outbreak is brought under control.' 

'The most effective means of reducing community transmission must be an effective testing, tracing and quarantine system, bolstered by enhanced local health capacity and physical distancing.

'These are essential prerequisites to reduce the spread, save lives and manage economic and job impacts.'
