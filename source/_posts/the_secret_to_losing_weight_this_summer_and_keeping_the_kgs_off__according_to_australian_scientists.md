Australia's national science agency says those wanting to shed a few kilos for summer - and keep them off - should prepare well and start as they intend to finish.

An analysis of the CSIRO's widely acclaimed 12-week high-protein, low-GI eating plan formulated by the nation's top scientists, found that a strong start in the first three weeks of a diet is the best way to ensure greater long-term weight loss.

The study of more than 22,000 CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet members showed those who started strongest were able to lose one kilo or more per week for the first three weeks, and achieve three-and-a-half times greater total weight loss than those who had a slower start.

CSIRO research scientist Gilly Hendrie said people who lost the most weight in the first three weeks and kept the weight off spent two days preparing and used the online planning and self-monitoring tools 50 per cent more than others.

'Allow two days to organise yourself before you start a weight loss program, including purchasing food and getting familiar with meal plans,' she said.

The most successful weight loss occurred when people studied their meal plans, used the food tracker, looked up foods every day and weighed in regularly.Â 

'It's been a challenging time for Australians recently, with diet and wellbeing understandably taking a back seat for some people,' Dr Hendrie said.

An analysis of the CSIRO's widely acclaimed 12-week high-protein, low-GI eating plan formulated by the nation's top scientists, found that a strong start in the first three weeks of a diet is the best way to ensure greater long-term weight loss.

'With this in mind, we are pleased to have the evidence that shows, with the right framework, tactics and attitude, people can set themselves up for effective weight loss.'

The CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet has now introduced the Interactive 'Start Strong Guide', with step-by-step instructions for getting off to the best possible start.

'At a time when we are using digital platforms more than ever, the CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet provides a strong framework to support this early and sustained weight loss - whilst also fitting into the habits of our new normal,' Dr Hendrie said.

It has also introduced the protein balance plus program which focuses on high-protein, low-GI meals - the most effective way to lose fat and keep weight off long-term.
