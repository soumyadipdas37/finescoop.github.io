Costa Coffee has added a new 'Mini' size to its menu, which will be available from Thursday from just £1.66.

While the existing cup sizes, Primo, Medio and Massimo, will remain the same, the coffee chain are ditching the Italian names in favour of English titles, 'Small, Medium and Large' across all of their UK stores.

The new menu for autumn will also feature brand new food products - including  a hoisin duck wrap and a creamy mushroom risotto, as well as a new set of 'value bundles' and meal deals. 

The new, smaller 8oz serve joins the existing cup family, and with the coffee chain knocking 25p off the price for those who bring a reusable cup, the total cost could be as little as £1.41.

Costa have also slashed their popular meal deal to its cheapest ever price. The chain's new deal allows customers to grab a small coffee or cold beverage and a savoury item for £4, anytime between 11am – 3pm every day. 

This includes Vegan Ham & CheeZe Toastie, the best-selling Ham and Cheese Toastie, the classic Egg Sandwich and the Tomato and Basil Soup.

Costa has also introduced a brand new £5 premium meal deal, which includes any drink and other options, such as the new hoisin duck wrap and the creamy mushroom risotto. 

Fans of sweet treats will also be excited to see that Costa's Honeycomb Range has been extended for autumn - including the delectable Honeycomb Latte Macchiato and Honeycomb Cappuccino.

The existing cup sizes, Primo, Medio and Massimo, will remain the same, but Costa are ditching the Italian names for the English titles, 'Small, Medium and Large' in all UK stores. The cups are pictured in order of size

New menu items for autumn also include a caramel bramley apple tart, and a chocolate torte - a sweet chocolate pastry case filled with chocolate ganache. 

And those prone to a nostalgic classic will be thrilled to see the Rolo® muffin still on the counter following its hugely popular launch early this year.

Customers who want a protein kick can pick up a Carb Killa® salted caramel chocolate chip™ bar, while the Jammy Flapjackm which is vegan and gluten free, is also on the menu.
