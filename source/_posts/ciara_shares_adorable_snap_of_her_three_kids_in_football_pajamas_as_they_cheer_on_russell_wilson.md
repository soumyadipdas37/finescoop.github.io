With the return of the NFL, Sundays are all about football in the Russell family. 

On Monday, 34-year-old Ciara shared a sweet snap of her three children from the weekend as the family cheered on Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, 31, from the comfort of their own home.

In the Instagram photo the adorable kids are wearing matching football pajamas as they cuddled on the couch.

Proving it is never too soon to start thinking about football, Ciara dressed their two-month-old son Win in the same outfit as his elder siblings. 

Future Zahir, six, Ciara's son from ex, rapper Future, was seen cradling the newborn like a protective older brother as he held the little guy in his arms.

Daughter Sienna, three, the firstborn child of Russell and Ciara, sat next to them on the couch as she playfully touched her hair.

She captioned the image, 'Football is Family. Proud of you #3, #GoHawks'.

All three children grinned sweetly for the camera as they rooted for their Super Bowl winning dad as he led his team to victory against the New England Patriots. 

Football Sundays are sacred for the family as Ciara and the kids cheer on Russell in every single game fully decked out in Seahawks gear. 

Last week the hitmaker shared an adorable photo of the couple's newborn son, Win, in a full football outfit with face-paint and all, as he 'watched' his first game. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, even family members of teammates are often barred from fully attending NFL games as the organization is prioritizing the health of their players, and doing their part to slow the spread of the virus.

Shedding: Ciara is aiming to shed the 48 pounds gained during her pregnancy to try and get back to her pre-baby weight

After giving birth months ago, the Goodies singer has been back on her fitness game as she tries to shed her baby weight. 

She has vowed to shed 48 pounds as quickly as possible, working out with a trainer multiple times a week. 

The couple first announced their pregnancy in January a few months ahead of lockdown. 

Ciara recounted the stress she felt after finding out that Russell was not allowed to be present for her first ultrasound due to Covid restrictions. 

'We FaceTimed in the car and I was in the doctor's office, that was, like, a really significant moment, I think, in all of this that really marked the time of where I am in my life as a pregnant woman' she said.

On top of that, she experienced the looming fear that her partner of four years would not be allowed in delivery room with her, though thankfully it worked out.   

Speaking to People after giving birth Ciara shared, 'It's been a blessing being able to be with my family more than normal. We have faith that we're going to figure it all out' despite the crazy times.    

The family have settled into their waterfront house in Bellevue, Washington just a short drive away from the Seahawks practice facility. 

Ciara and Russell wed in 2016 after dating for two years, after getting together post their respective breakups in 2014.  

Russell was previously married to Ashton Meem and Ciara was engaged to rapper Future with whom they share son Future Zahir. The couple made their first public appearance out together at the White House state dinner in 2015.
