Britain's 'biggest brood' has welcomed a 27th child into their family after seventh child Millie gave birth to a baby girl.  

Millie Radford, 18, the seventh eldest daughter of Sue and Noel Radford, has given birth to a baby girl named Ophelia. 

The happy news was announced on Instagram Saturday when Millie shared a picture of her baby's feet as she lay on a peach blanket, accompanied by the caption: 'The biggest chapter of our lives has begun.' 

Millie has been sharing her pregnancy journey with her 81,000 followers on Instagram. 

According to the hospital tag wrapped around the infant's leg, baby Ophelia was born last night at '19:05hrs.'

At the end of August, Millie shared a picture of herself sitting with her bump, a baby seat and a towel with the name 'Ophelia' emblazoned on it

Millie said that coronavirus lockdown impacted her experience of pregnancy

In a separate post on the Radford family's Instagram page, the family said: 'Welcome to the family beautiful Ophelia [...] i can't even put into words how incredibly proud I am of @millieradford you did AMAZING bringing this beautiful blessing into the world. We love you both so much [...].' 

The post was accompanied with a picture of grandma Sue holding Ophelia while she grips on tightly to her thumb with her tiny hand. 

At the end of August, Millie shared a picture of herself sitting with her bump, a baby seat and a towel with the name 'Ophelia' emblazoned on it. 

The post was accompanied with the caption: '7 weeks until we get to meet Baby I can't wait to meet you.'

Grandma-to-be Sue replied to the post saying: 'Counting down the weeks till we get to hold you Ophelia we love you so much already.'   

Sue caused Millie to burst out in tears when she treated her to a brand new pram and other baby items, the Mirror reports. 

Millie said coronavirus lockdown has impacted her experience of pregnancy.

'I'm gutted I haven't had the chance to enjoy this pregnancy like I wanted to because of lockdown,' she said in an Instagram post. 

'No baby shopping, no listening to baby's heartbeat, no sharing this experience with my friends or family.'  

Millie previously said her baby was conceived during a six-month relationship with a boy around her own age.

They are no longer together but her former partner has vowed to be a part of his baby's life.

She adds the couple didn't use contraception but she wasn't worried about STI's as she 'trusted him' and had 'known him for years.'

Millie told The Sun: 'We didn't use protection. I knew there was a risk of pregnancy but I didn't think it'd be so easy.

'And I didn't worry about STIs, as I trusted him. I'd known him for years.'

And after the test which revealed she was two-to-three weeks pregnant in early January, Millie revealed how her 'fear' quickly turned to 'excitement' - despite being apprehensive about telling her parents.

But she said Sue, 45, and Noel, 49, who run a bakery business, were 'excited' with the new arrival which will make them grandparents to five.  

As for their own brood - Sue and Noel's most recent child is Heidi, who was born in April this year, with the others being Chris, 30, Sophie, 26, Chloe, 24, Jack, 22, Daniel, 21, Luke, 19, Millie, 18, Katie, 17, James, 16, Ellie, 14, Aimee, 13, Josh, 12, Max, 11, Tillie, nine, Oscar, eight, Casper, seven, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, Archie 2 and Bonnie, 1. 

The couple met for the first time when Sue was seven, before going on to have their first child when Sue was 14 and Noel was 19.

They got married in 1993 when Sue turned 18, and went on to have nine children before Noel had a vasectomy - which he later had reversed.

Sadly Alfie, the couple's 17th child, was still born on July 6th 2014.
