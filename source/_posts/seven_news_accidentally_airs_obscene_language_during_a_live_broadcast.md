Everyone knows mistakes can happen when it comes to live TV.

And on Seven News this week, eagle-eyed fans couldn't help but notice a massive blunder in the background of a broadcast, featuring reporter Samantha Brett.

Viewers took to Reddit to point out that the network accidentally aired obscene language in the cross from Woolworths, as one person joked that the cameraman was 'having a bit of a giggle.' 

When you see it! Seven News accidentally aired obscene language during a live broadcast this week (pictured)… so how long did it take YOU to notice?

Behind Samantha was a 'butcher' sign, that was obscured by a pole. 

It appeared that the blonde journalist was standing in front of a sign that read 'b***her.'

'Camera person havin' a bit of a giggle aye,' one user wrote on Reddit.

Another added: 'There is no way the camera operator accidentally did this.'

Another remarked: 'Took a second to spot it: 'B***her.' 

A user had originally shared a screen grab from the cross and said it was the 'best planned camera angle from 7 News.' 

In May, Amber Laidler got the fright of her life during a live broadcast for Seven News Sydney when a car drove past and honked its horn.

Amber, who is married to AFL star Jeremy Laidler, 30, laughed off the blooper and shared footage to Instagram of the moment she got scared on camera.

'That scared the s**t out of me,' Amber said in the video, while standing by a busy road in Sydney's Mosman. 

Poking fun at herself, she wrote in the caption: 'Today we learnt I don't scare easily... and I'm prepared to use a hand mic as a weapon.'

Amber added the hashtags #NewsBloopers and #Honk.

Erin Holland, who was crowned Miss World Australia in 2013, commented below the clip: 'This is gold.'  

Amber has made a name for herself as a reporter at Seven News after stepping away from the beauty pageant circuit.

She had won Miss World Australia in 2011, before going on to study journalism.
