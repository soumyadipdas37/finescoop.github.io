The Gold Coast is in the running to host AFL's night of nights.

A venue for this year's Brownlow Medal is due to be announced in the coming days after the Gabba in Brisbane won the rights to host this year's grand final on October 24.

It's understood the Brownlows could be held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre.

AFL boss Gil McLachlan said the Brownlows would be a 'hybrid event', including virtual appearances by players.

More to come.
