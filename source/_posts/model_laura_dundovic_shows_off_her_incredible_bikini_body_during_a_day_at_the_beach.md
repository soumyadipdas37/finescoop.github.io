Laura Dundovic showed off her incredible bikini body during a day at Sydney's Balmoral Beach on Tuesday. 

Dressed in a tiny white G-string bikini, the former Miss Universe Australia, 32, certainly turned heads as she soaked up the sun with her lookalike mother Shirley  

The model's bikini consisted of a skimpy bandeau top secured with thin straps across the back and perilously skimpy G- bottoms.

The former Miss Universe Australia made the most of the warm weather, basking in the sunshine and enjoying a leisurely conversation with her mother.  

Her long blonde hair was tied up in a high ponytail on top of her head, and she wore narrow black sunglasses.

After a quick dip, the star was seen drying off with a black-and-white printed beach towel.

Lying alongside her mother on the sand, Laura used a baseball cap to shield her face from the sun as she flipped through her phone.

When it was time to leave, Laura pulled on a short white jumpsuit over her bikini.

Meanwhile, Shirley opted for white shorts and a white linen shirt, and carried a monogram Louis Vuitton handbag on one shoulder. 

In an interview with 9Honey in December, Laura said she has a healthy attitude towards exercise.

'Because I always enjoyed sport and I see exercise as something exciting, it keeps me motivated,' she explained. 

'If I am exhausted and don't feel like training I don't push myself but if I do want to push myself, I'll do a double session, but I try not to be too regimented.' 

She added: 'Go to the gym every day if you like but if your head isn't in a good space, don't push yourself. Sometimes I'll train hard for three months but then I might take three months off.'
