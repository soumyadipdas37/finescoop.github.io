In the absence of any Ryder Cup this week, the three Englishmen left in the US Open had to settle for glamour match-ups in the final round on Saturday that would have represented a good rehearsal.

Paul Casey got to walk the fairways with world No 1 Dustin Johnson.

Lee Westwood’s playing partner was Tony Finau, while Matt Wallace had Rickie Fowler for company.

The Brits in the US Open faced matches that would have helped their Ryder Cup preparations

Dustin Johnson was the opponent of Paul Casey, with the world No 1 coming in as favourite 

What they had to play for, though, was a world away from the tension of the biennial dust-up.

For Johnson and Casey, what a contrast to the excitement they felt going into the final round of the last major, the USPGA Championship, where the pair ended up tied second.

Johnson came into this event as the hot favourite but there was always the worry he would run out of steam after a 2-1-2-1 run in his last four events and so it proved.

Credit Johnson, who showed plenty of professionalism and pride and to finish with a 70. So did Casey, who had a roller- coaster week, opening with rounds of 76-70 and then two nines of 39-30 on Saturday, before finishing with a 73.

Lee Westwood impressed, with the 47-year-old performing once again in his suited major 

One up to America, if you like.

What a fine week Westwood enjoyed in his first tournament in the US since March.

The US Open was always the major that most suited his magnificent long game.

He might have been frustrated with his second round 76 but a second successive 72 on Saturday gave him a top-20 finish, which was highly creditable given he is now 47. Finau, however, pipped him by one.

As for Wallace, it was in New York last year that he delivered his finest major display to date, finishing third in the USPGA at Bethpage. He will be disappointed with a last round 77 to finish outside the top 40, although he did beat Fowler by two shots.
