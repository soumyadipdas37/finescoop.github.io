Arsenal's new signing Willian contributed three assists within the first 57 minutes of his debut for the Gunners.

The Brazilian frontman became head coach Mikel Arteta's first signing of the summer, penning a three-year deal at the Emirates after leaving Stamford Bridge at the end of his contract.

The 32-year-old set up Alexandre Lacazette, Gabriel and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang during their opening game of the 2020-2021 season against Fulham.

Fans instantly took to social media to praise Mikel Arteta's first signing of the summer

Fans were quick to take to social media to share their thoughts on the Arsenal's new signing. 

One Chelsea fan wrote: 'After years of wanting Willian to leave he then gets a hat trick of assists on his Arsenal debut as well as successfully beating the first man on the corner.' 

While an Arsenal fan praised Arsene Wenger for the club's signing, Tweeting: 'You're telling me Arsene Wenger signed Edu, so he could go on to be the man in charge of transfers so he could sign Willian for free and get three assists on his debut? Big Weng has done it again.'   







Arsenal were initially criticised for snapping Willian up on a free and giving him a three-year contract worth £220,000 a week.

But Arteta insisted that the former Chelsea player could make a long-term contribution at Arsenal.

Having contributed to Arsenal's success on the opening day of the Premier League, fans now recognise the role that Willian could play at Arsenal.   





One fan praise the forward, saying: 'Willian has already matched Mesut Ozil's tally of two assists for each of the last two seasons.'

While another fan commented: 'Mad how Willian on a free has already got 15 % of Pepe's GA last season in just one game ..football eh.' 

One Twitter even called for Willian to win the Ballon d'Or.   

Willian previously said he had set his sights on winning the Premier League title and European trophies with Arsenal after manager Arteta convinced him to sign. 

The Brazilian said: 'I decided [to join] because Arsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world. They have a new project with Mikel Arteta.

'I think this club deserve to shine again and I want to be a part of this project — to be a part of the Arsenal family is amazing. I'm very happy to do that.

'I come to try to win trophies, because this club deserve to win again, and I think you have to do the best as possible to win every game.'
