Bristol City were barely given a chance to get into the game as Aston Villa cruised past them in the EFL Cup third round on Thursday night.

Anwar El Ghazi opened the scoring after just 11 minutes, and three minutes later the lead was doubled thanks to Bertrand Traore. 

Ollie Watkins put the game to bed with around 15 minutes to go on what was a very comfortable evening for Dean Smith's men.
