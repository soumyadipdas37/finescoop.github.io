Brody Jenner has been romantically linked to celebrity stylist Briana Jungwirth, 28, since May.

But the 37-year-old reality star was spotted enjoying a cozy lunch date with a gorgeous brunette woman at Howdy's in Malibu on Tuesday afternoon. 

Adhering to COVID-19 regulations, the pair dined on the restaurant's patio.

The couple were last spotted out publicly on August 8, so some drama may have gone down between the pair that was never publicized.

Briana happens to share a four-year-old son named Freddie with former One Direction member, Louis Tomlinson, 28.

In June, it was reported Brody introduced Briana to his estranged wife Kaitlynn Carter after a month of dating – and the pair are said to have hit it off. 

He was keen to seek his former flame's approval and the two women got on like a house on fire, TMZ reports, with Kaitlynn feeling he's found a 'good match' in Briana.

'Brody and Kaitlynn are still very close, they are co-parenting dogs after all, and BJ really wanted Kaitlynn's approval on his new GF, which he got,' the website states.

'Briana seemed cool with meeting a slice of Brody's past, and she totally understood the dog situation and the fact Brody and Kaitlynn will remain in the same circles.'

Briana and Kaitlynn are said to have 'got along' and even discussed the former's young son Freddie, who Brody is believed to have met. 

A source told TMZ that Kaitlynn feels her former husband has found a 'good match', adding: 'Kaitlynn felt Briana was very kind and with Brody for all the right reasons.'

'Brody wanted to introduce Briana to Kaitlynn so she'd be comfortable with a situation that is anything but standard for exes,' TMZ's source added.

Brody and Kaitlynn married in an intimate ceremony in Bali in 2018, but parted ways in 2019 after five years together.   

The couple's split was confirmed when Kaitlynn was pictured in an intimate clinch with singer Miley Cyrus, 27, while on holiday in Lake Como, Italy, last August.

Their surprise relationship also marked the end of Miley's 20-month marriage to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, 30.
