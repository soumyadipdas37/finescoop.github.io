A toddler has died from horrific injuries after being attacked by dogs who tore off his genitals while his parents were celebrating his birthday.

Two-year-old Yegor died without regaining consciousness after a desperate 10-day fight for his life in a Ukrainian hospital.

The child's heart stopped beating one day after doctors reported a slight improvement in his condition. 

He had been on a ventilator and kidney dialysis and his condition remained critical during the 10 agonising days.

Yegor, two, in hospital where he died after an agonising 10-day fight for his life following an attack by dogs who ripped off his genitals 

The tragedy unfolded in the small town of Selydove, eastern Ukraine, on September 18 – as the family were celebrating the boy's second birthday.

Reports say the toddler walked outside unnoticed while his parents were sitting at a table with their guests.

It is understood that Yegor was wandering around the courtyard when two German Shepherd guard dogs broke out of their enclosure and attacked him.

Noticing the child's absence, the parents went to search for him.

Charity volunteer Aleksandra Timoshchenkova, who helped the family to collect money for Yegor's treatment said: 'The boy was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood.

'The dogs were still tearing him apart.'

According to reports, the dogs managed to break out of their enclosure because Yegor's father had failed to close its door properly.

Yegor was transported by a military helicopter to the city of Dnipro to receive the medical care he needed

Medics attend to Yegor, spending five hours restoring his damaged blood vessels, bladder and intestines. They also removed tissues 'that had been chewed by the dogs'

During the attack, they ripped off the boy's genitals, anus and tore the femoral artery on his left leg, say local media.

Because of the severity of his injuries, Yegor was transported by a military helicopter to the city of Dnipro to receive the medical care he needed.

The boy was admitted to Dnipro Regional Children's Hospital where four crews of surgeons started battling for his life.

It took medics five hours to restore his damaged blood vessels, bladder and intestines. They also removed tissues 'that had been chewed by the dogs'.

Natalia Dementyeva, the head of the hospital commented: 'The boy suffered extremely severe injuries known as dirty wounds.'

Police launched a criminal case for failure to fulfil parental duties resulted in severe consequences against Yegor's mother and father.

The parents face up to three years in prison if found guilty.

The investigation continues.
