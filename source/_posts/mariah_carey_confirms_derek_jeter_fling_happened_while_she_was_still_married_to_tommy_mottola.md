Mariah Carey confirms in her upcoming memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey that her fling with Derek Jeter actually happened while she was married.

While the fling between Carey, 50, and Jeter, 46, was rumored for years, the diva confirmed in her memoir that it happened at the end of her marriage to Sony Music president Tommy Mottola, who she was married to from 1993 to 1998. 

Carey also confirmed in a Vulture profile that two songs from her 1997 album Butterfly were about her fling with Jeter, The Roof and My All.

Fling: While the fling between Carey, 50, and Jeter, 46, was rumored for years, the diva confirmed in her memoir that it happened at the end of her marriage to Sony Music president Tommy Mottola, who she was married to from 1993 to 1998

The songstress revealed in her memoir that she met Jeter at a dinner party, and she started secretly 'text-flirting' with the New York Yankees legend.

Many fans had speculated previously that The Roof song was about her first secret meeting with Jeter, on the rooftop of his New York City apartment building.

She reveals new details as well, such as that she wore a 'buttery leather Chanel skirt' and that they sipped on Moet before they shared a secret kiss in the rain.

'Of course I do! I can never forget that moment,' Carey said in an excerpt of the memoir, which will  be published on September 29.

'I mean, it’s not like it was some intensely deep, intellectually stimulating — again, it was a great moment, and it happened in a divine way because it helped me get past living there, in Sing Sing, under those rules and regulations,' she added.

She called the house she shared with Mottola Sing Sing, a reference to a the prison of the same name an hour north of New York City.

Carey also revealed that the lyric, 'I'd risk my life to feeeeyall / Your body next to mine' in the second song about Jeter, My All, it referred to the singer literally risking her life to spend a secret night in Puerto Rico with Jeter.  

She added that, during her time with Mottola, she felt his security team was reporting her every move to her husband, describing him as an 'oppressive humidity' that she could never escape from.

When she was discussing her time with Mottola in a Zoom call for the Vulture piece, she broke down in tears, adding, 'It ignites the triangle in my stomach.'

Carey also hinted that after their marriage ended, she suspected he tried to sabotage her career, referencing  2017 Desus & Mero interview with Murder Inc. CEO Irv Gotti, who confirmed Mottola boosted a Jennifer Lopez and Ja Rule duet to 'mess' with her.

The singer admitted, though, that he might take issue with her portrayal, while insisting she could have painted him in a much worse light.

'I could have gone harder. And I didn’t. I give him credit where credit is due,' she added.
