Electric scooter owners are offering online guides showing users how to override the devices’ speed-limiting software to reach up to 40mph.

A Mail on Sunday investigation has unearthed dozens of shocking video tutorials encouraging riders to manipulate the battery-powered vehicles and break the law. 

In one clip, a British rider promises viewers that their scooter will ‘go like a rocket’. ‘I don’t think you would feel safe going any faster but it’s so much fun,’ he adds.

Rental e-scooters were made legal on some roads in Britain this summer with their speed capped at 15.5mph.

Electric scooter owners are offering online guides showing users how to override the devices’ speed-limiting software to reach up to 40mph. An e-scooter user is seen riding through the pedestrianised town centre of Middlesbrough 

But our investigation has revealed how, with just a few taps of the device, owners can easily hack into the software and increase the top speed of some of the most popular scooters sold in the UK.

One British e-scooter owner, Dave Samuel, released a video showing viewers how to ‘unlock’ the Inokim OXO Electric Scooter, a popular model on sale in the UK for £1,300.

‘I’m making this video on how to derestrict the scooter from its factory setting of 15mph to full blown 40mph,’ he says, before giving detailed, step-by-step instructions about how to remove the limiter.

In a separate video, another Briton, Duncan Smith, reveals how to ‘hack’ the top speeds for the Xiaomi M365 scooter, another popular model available for £469 in Halfords.

‘By unlocking the scooter, by which I mean the speed limit that’s on it, you can go a little bit faster. I say a little bit faster but I mean this scooter will go like a rocket,’ he says.

In the clip, which sees Smith whizzing along public pavements – which is illegal – and weaving between young children, he explains how users can remove the software that limits the speed to 15mph and reach top speeds of 22mph. 

‘In my opinion, this is the hack that makes buying the Xiaomi Pro an absolute no-brainer compared to other more expensive e-scooters. Once you release the speed limiter on this thing it feels like a proper little rocket. I don’t even think you would feel safe going any faster but it’s so much fun.’ 

In a third video, a user explains how a Kaabo Electric Scooter, which sell in the UK for about £500, can be hacked so it reaches speeds of 25mph. In the comments sections of the video, one person wrote: ‘Just hacked my scooter! It really worked! I’m going rocket speed now.’

Last night, campaigners warned that the ‘hacks’ would lead to even more accidents and injuries on the roads.

Luke Griggs, Deputy Chief Executive of brain injury association Headway, said: ‘It is extremely concerning to see online tutorials explaining how to remove the speed limiters on e-scooters. The production of such videos is irresponsible and is likely to lead to severe injuries and possibly fatalities. Tragically, it is not just the riders that will be placed in danger, it is innocent members of the public.

‘We are already seeing repeated reports of e-scooters being ridden on pavements at excessive speeds, with the most vulnerable in society being placed in harm’s way.’

Last night, Mr Smith said: ‘There are speed limits in public, so anything over 15mph would be for private use on private land. If you choose to break the law and go dangerously fast in public that is not my doing.’
