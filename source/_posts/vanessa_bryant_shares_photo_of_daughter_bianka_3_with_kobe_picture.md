Vanessa Bryant shared a heartbreaking picture to Instagram on Friday showing her three-year-old daughter Bianka.

The toddler was holding a framed photograph of her 'DaDa' Kobe Bryant who died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California in January.

The former basketball star perished with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna along with all seven other people who were in the aircraft at the time.

Mourning: Vanessa Bryant shared a heartbreaking Instagram picture on Friday showing her three-year-old daughter Bianka holding a photo of her late 'DaDa' Kobe Bryant

Along with Bianka, Vanessa and Kobe's surviving daughters are 17-year-old Natalia and one-year-old Capri. 

Vanessa's latest post came three days after she posted a meme saying: 'We are often let down by the most trusted people and loved by the most unexpected ones.'

She uploaded the meme one day after Univision aired an explosive clip with her mother Sofia Laine about their relationship.

Sofia claimed that Vanessa told her, '"I need you to get out of this house,"' and also alleged that her daughter 'told me that she wanted her car and she wants it now.'

Happier times: Kobe perished in a helicopter crash this January with his daughter Gianna and seven others; father and daughter are pictured together at a Lakers game last year 

In response Vanessa denied kicking Sofia out of the house and marveled at her 'audacity' in making the allegations in the wake of the loss.

Vanessa gave the program a statement alleging that her mother 'has removed all her diamond jewelry, emptied the apartment I provided, and put away the furniture to make it look like she doesn't have my support.'

She argued that she was still mourning her husband and daughter while Sofia was 'shedding tears for a car and a house that were not in her name.'

Vanessa asserted: 'My husband and I have supported her financially for the past 20 years, and continue to do so, in addition to her monthly alimony.' 

Grief: This week Vanessa, pictured at Kobe and Gianna's memorial, had to defend herself from her mother Sofia Laine's explosive Univision interview about their relationship 

Sofia divorced Vanessa's stepfather Stephen Laine in 2003 after a 13-year marriage amid allegations of his infidelity, which he denied.

Further she accused her mother of having 'not been physically present or emotionally supportive' in the months since the family tragedy.

Vanessa, who had four daughters with Kobe, added: 'Now I see what is most important to my mother and it's more than painful. I hope that everything that is coming out about our personal relationship ends here.'

Sofia and Kobe had been close during his life, a bond that some speculate was especially important to him due to his strained relations with his own parents.

Allegations: Sofia claimed that Vanessa 'told me: "I need you to get out of this house,"' and also alleged that her daughter 'told me that she wanted her car and she wants it now' 

Stephen Laine made a public statement on Sofia when Vanessa and Kobe nearly broke up in 2011 owing to infidelity.

'Her mother taught her well to wait for the 10-year mark,' alleged Stephen of Vanessa, who married Kobe in 2001.

'In California, it's considered a long term marriage and then she gets paid for life or until she remarries… just like her mother is doing to me. I have to pay her mom $1,800 every month and clearly, they don't need it.'

Vanessa is also suing the LA County Sheriff's department over graphic photos allegedly taken by deputies at the scene of the crash that killed Kobe and Gianna.
