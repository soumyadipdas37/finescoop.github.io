Filming for the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! usually takes place in South Africa in early January, but that's all set to change in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

It appears the hit reality series will be filmed in Murwillumbah, in northern New South Wales, at a campsite normally used for the UK series.

According to TV Tonight, with production unable to travel overseas due to coronavirus travel restrictions, the 2021 series will be filmed in Australia.

The campsite is less than an hour from the Gold Coast, off Dungay Creek Road, north of Murwillumbah.

The UK version of the show, which has been filmed in Australia for almost two decades, has also been forced to reconsider its location due to the pandemic.

Back in May, ViacomCBS executive Beverley McGarvey confirmed the show would 'definitely be back next year' and that a potential change of format was on the cards.

At the time, Ms McGarvey explained I'm A Celebrity... could 'absolutely' be filmed Down Under.  

'The jungle is kind of a character in the show, but we just don't know if that's possible or realistic, so we're just looking at a range of options,' she told news.com.au

I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is just one of the many television shows to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier this month, seven dancers from The Masked Singer tested positive for coronavirus and the show's stars - including judges Dannii Minogue and Jackie 'O' Henderson - were ordered to self-isolate.

The COVID-19 bombshell came on the night of the show's grand final being filmed. 

The show's set is in Melbourne, which is at the centre of Australia's coronavirus second wave.
