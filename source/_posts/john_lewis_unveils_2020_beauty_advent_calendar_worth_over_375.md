Beauty advent calendars have grown in popularity in recent years with many brands now offering swoon-worthy Christmas countdowns.

And today John Lewis has released details of its eagerly awaited beauty advent calendar for 2020 - and it doesn't disappoint.

Launching October 6, this year's calendar retails for £150 and contains over £375 worth of the most sought-after products from John Lewis' beauty department.

Whether you want to treat a loved one or simply spoil yourself, John Lewis' beauty advent calendar for 2020 doesn't disappoint 

The retailer's offering is certainly generous, as this year's beauty advent calendar includes 25 premium must-haves, including eight full-sized products from the nation's favourite beauty brands and three fragrances. It's a great opportunity to discover new products and indulge in iconic classics.

Last year's advent from John Lewis was a sell-out, and since 2020's offering is bursting with big names it's sure to sell out swiftly too. If you're a My John Lewis member, you can be the first to shop the calendar on October 1 before it goes on general sale on October 6.

So we recommend signing up ASAP because who doesn't love a chic beauty advent calendar full of skincare and makeup must-haves?

Sustainability has been front of mind when designing this year's calendar, and the carefully curated selection is housed in a fully recyclable box with reversible drawers for those that want reuse and fill up next year.

While we don't want to spoil all the surprises, there a few favourites hiding inside that we couldn't help but share. Keep an eye out for bestsellers from Sunday Riley, Shiseido, Charlotte Tilbury, Disciple, Slip, Elemis and Nars, to name but a few.

For those who want a sneak peek inside, here's a full list.

The John Lewis advent calendar, £150, will be available from October 6. Sign up for a My John Lewis membership for priority access October 1 via the John Lewis app across the My John Lewis Virtual Beauty Weekend.
