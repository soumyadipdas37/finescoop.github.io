The creators of Spitting Image have been blasted for giving Jewish billionaire Mark Zuckerberg's puppet a hooked nose.

The Facebook founder, 36, is set to feature in a revived version of the cult show on Britbox on October 3.

Mr Zuckerberg was given a 'gratuitously large, hooked nose and ghoulish appearance', according to the Campaign Against Antisemitism.

Spitting Image exaggerates the characteristics of royals and celebrities to make a mockery of the establishment. 

But campaigners said choosing to highlight Mr Zuckerberg's nose rather than his 'multiple eyebags' and 'saggy chin' was a classic sign of antisemitism.

One took to Twitter to say: 'Exaggerating physical features is Spitting Image's shtick.

'And yet Mark Zuckerberg has incredible multiple eye bags and a sagging chin that aren't caricatured.

'But the hooked nose he doesn't have, is, almost like their caricaturists don't know how to portray Jews without one.' 

Spitting Image was a hit satirical TV show in the 1980s that showed wax puppets of famous faces with exaggerated features mocking contemporary issues.

A spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemism said: 'Spitting Image should explain why a Jewish personality has been caricatured to appear with a gratuitously large, hooked nose and ghoulish appearance.

'When in real life Mark Zuckerberg is not associated with either of those physical features.

'Satire is integral to comedy and a vital part of our public conversation, but it should be based in reality and not on lazy and offensive stereotypes.'

Another campaigner took to Twitter to compare the caricature with Nazi propaganda used to 'stir up hatred against Jews' in the 1930s and 1940s.

Adam Creme wrote: 'A photo of Mark Zuckerberg and his Spitting Image puppet.

'The portrayal of exaggerated hooked noses was a key tactic of Nazi propaganda to stir up hatred against Jews.'

Others chose to make light of it, with one saying: 'The only controversial thing about the Mark Zuckerberg Spitting Image puppet is that it looks more like Chris Martin than Mark Zuckerberg.' 

On Friday, September 11, it was confirmed a new series featuring 100 new puppets will debut next month.

Spitting Image has been approached for comment.
