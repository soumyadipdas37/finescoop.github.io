A man has been arrested after allegedly firing a crossbow in an Aldi supermarket near Brisbane. 

Queensland Police said the man opened fire in the Aldi at Booval in Ipswich at about 4.45pm on Tuesday before shoppers took him down.

'He started firing and I believe members of the public have tackled that person but I can't confirm that at this stage,' Inspector Scott Calcutt told the Courier-Mail.

A woman was treated injuries to her hand and stomach and was taken to Queensland Children's Hospital in a stable condition.
