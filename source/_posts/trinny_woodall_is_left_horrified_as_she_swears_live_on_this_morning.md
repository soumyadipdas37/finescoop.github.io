Trinny Woodall enjoyed a glamourous lunch with a pal at her beloved Scott's Restaurant in Mayfair on Monday afternoon.  

The What Not To Wear star, 56, sported a bold pink coat and chic trousers for the lunch, where she appeared to defy social distancing by cuddling her friend.   

Her lunch came just hours before she tickled This Morning fans on Tuesday when she accidentally swore by saying 'bloody' while speaking to Phillip Schofield.

Trinny looked sensational in  her bold pink coat which she paired with cream trousers complete with a complementary pink stripe down the leg.

She wore her hair in bouncy lengths and donned dazzling make-up. 

Sitting at the table she usually shares with her partner Charles Saatchi, Trinny chatted animatedly and hugged her pal during the lunch. 

The following day, while appearing on the magazine show, Phillip, 58, queried: 'Are you going to say anything?', before an affronted Trinny responded: 'I will, I couldn’t bloody well hear you', before clapping her hand to her mouth.

Trinny appeared horrified when she suffered the gaffe as she looked in shock, however her co-stars seemed to find the situation amusing.

Trinny's first snap showed her looking composed as she she worked out how to use her technology during the first week of the nationwide lockdown.

However just weeks later she seemed to have lost her cool, as she shared a hilarious snap of herself appearing to scream.

The TV presenter joked that a month into later she was enjoying her food, as she shared a shot of herself tucking into her dinner. 

Three months into lockdown, Trinny admitted she was among many other women who were desperate to have their beauty regime resumed.
