Radio host Monty Dimond was left distraught during an emotional conversation about her late mother for R U OK? Day on Thursday.

The 39-year-old radio host was asked how she was feeling by her colleague, Yumi Stynes, during their radio show, 3pm PickUp. 

Yumi, 45, suggested that instead of asking people, 'Are you okay?', a way of getting a more honest answer is by asking, 'How is the state of your heart in this breath?'

'The state of my heart, in all honesty, today and has been for some time, is equal split of joy and complete heartbreak,' said Monty, before breaking down in tears.

'Because, I'm growing a baby that I'm so excited about... but I don't have my mum here to do it with me. 

'And I'm scared, and I don't know how to do this life without my mum, but I'm doing it.

'So my heart is full, because I feel so much stronger than I ever knew I was, but I don't want to do it without her, so my heart's hurting. But it's equal split, so it's okay.' 

Her raw confession left her co-host audibly sobbing, with Yumi clearly moved by her colleague's candour.

'My worst nightmare has happened, of losing my mum, literally nursing my mum to her death, and I thought, "I can't breathe without my mum,"' added Monty.

She described the loss of someone you love as 'torturous', but insisted the human spirit was 'so much stronger' than most people realised.

Monty revealed her beloved mum had died in an emotionally charged Instagram post in November last year.  

'On Wednesday morning my soul mate/mum closed her eyes for the last time,' she wrote at the time.

'I feel so lucky that such a kick a**e, strong, hilarious, cheeky and unbelievably loyal woman was by my side for 38 years. I so badly want another 338 with her though. 

'I am feeling so numb one minute to crippled with unbearable disbelief and pain the next. 

'I'm not sure how to live my life without my mum by my side but I promised her I will give it all that I've got.'
