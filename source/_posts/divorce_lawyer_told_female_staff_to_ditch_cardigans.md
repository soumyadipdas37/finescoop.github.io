A leading divorce lawyer told female staff to ditch cardigans in a 1,000-word dress code email. 

Ayesha Vardag, who runs law firm Vardags in London's Old Bailey, wrote staff a lengthy email titled 'Attire and image — dress code and beyond'. 

In the email, the 'diva of divorce' reminded staff they needed to be 'looking fabulous at all times' according to Legal Cheek. 

Ayesha Vardag wrote staff a lengthy 1,000-word dress code email advising women to dress 'formal' but said they could also be 'discreetly sexy' 

She advised women to dress 'formal' but said they could also be 'discreetly sexy and colourful and flamboyant' and should aim for a 'Chanel/Dior/Armani look'.

Ms Vardag also noted they shouldn't wear anything 'homespun or homely' adding that 'cardigans are almost never ok'.  

According to the email, sent in July 2019, she said that women must wear 'elegant' shoes but doesn't say they need to be high-heeled. 

She added: 'I feel high heels have been disenfranchising and disabling women for decades.'

There are also rules laid out for men, who are told to go for a 'Savile Row look' but stresses that woolly jumpers 'are a no-no'.

This is also the case for 'super-tight trousers or pointy toes' which are 'sternly frowned upon'.  

They are also advised to wear 'classic' shoes that are 'black' because, as the old adage goes, 'never wear brown in town'.

Ms Vardag concluded the email with wisdom on health and fitness adding, 'eat well, move a lot, watch what you drink, get outside as much as you can, and glow.'

Stephen Bence, Vardags director of strategy, said that staff have 'a full understanding of the standards' but that an occasional reminder is needed. 

He added that they hold themselves to the highest possible professional standards' including their dress code which employees 'consent upon' when they join.
