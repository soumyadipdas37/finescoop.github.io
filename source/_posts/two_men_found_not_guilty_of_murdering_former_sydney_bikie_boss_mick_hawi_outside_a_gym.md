Two men have been acquitted of the execution-style murder of former Sydney bikie boss Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi .

Yusuf Guney Nazlioglu, 39, was accused of being the shooter while Jamal Eljaidi, 32, was said to be the getaway driver.

But a NSW Supreme Court jury on Thursday found them both not guilty of murder.

Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, who became Comancheros national president aged just 22 before relinquishing the role in 2009, was shot dead in his black Mercedes parked outside a Fitness First gym in Rockdale on February 15, 2018

Mr Hawi was executed in his black Mercedes outside a Fitness First gym in Rockdale on February 15, 2018.

The jury saw CCTV of the masked gunman, dressed in black from head to toe, leave the murder scene in a car driven by another man.

More to come.Â
