AJ Beatty told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: 'Every single person at Central knew "Juice". He had the ability to take over an entire room of people with his positive energy. 

'One of the few people in life that you will meet that there’s nothing to say bad about. He was one heck of a kid. Kind, intelligent, funny. He was electric.

'Did so much for the Central community. It was truly amazing. Such an awesome person all around.'

Central Catholic assistant football coach Dave Fleming added Jamain was 'the best soul I've ever coached'. 

Jamain was a defensive lineman for the Central Catholic High School Vikings, winning two WPIAL championships and a state championship in 2015. 

He went on to continue his football career at California University of Pennsylvania, where he played 32 games for the football team from 2017-19, and majored in Business Administration.

Central Catholic High School, where Stephens graduated in 2017, added 3,355lb Jamain remained supportive of the school after leaving for Cal U.

The school said: 'Jamain was an avid Central Catholic supporter, and could often be found cheering on the Vikings and sending videos and messages of support and encouragement to his younger Viking brothers.'

His father, 46, played five seasons in the NFL in the mid-90s and Jamain also leaves behind his mother, Kelly Allen, and two siblings.

A GoFundMe fundraiser has raised more than $10,000 to contribute towards Jamain's funeral costs.
