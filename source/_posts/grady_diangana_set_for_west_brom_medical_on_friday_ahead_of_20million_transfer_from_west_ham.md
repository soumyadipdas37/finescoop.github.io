Grady Diangana is due for a West Brom medical on Friday after agreeing personal terms with the Premier League new boys.

Diangana is poised to rejoin West Brom permanently on a five-year deal after the two clubs agreed a deal worth in the region of £20m including add-ons.

West Brom have moved quickly after finalising a deal with West Ham on Wednesday.

Though Fulham boss Scott Parker is a big fan of Diangana and could yet launch a late attempt to hijack the deal and scupper his proposed return to the Hawthorns.

Diangana made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more to play a key role for former Hammers manager Slaven Bilic's side as they won promotion back to the Premier League.

West Ham have been considering their options since Diangana's return ahead of the new season.

They initially hoped to offload one of their bigger earning stars such as Jack Wilshere, Felipe Anderson or Manuel Lanzini in order to raise funds for their own transfer business.

But having been unable to they are now open to cashing in on Diangana while they are keen on bringing in Said Benrahma from Brentford.

The England youth international made his senior West Ham debut in September 2018, scoring twice in an 8-0 League Cup win against Macclesfield, and has featured a total of 21 times for the club after coming through their academy.
