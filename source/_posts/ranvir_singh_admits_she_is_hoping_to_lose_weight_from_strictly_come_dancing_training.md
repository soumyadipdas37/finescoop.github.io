Ranvir Singh has admitted that she is hoping to lose weight from Strictly Come Dancing training after putting on a stone in lockdown.

The Good Morning Britain star, 43, is one of the 2020 celebrities taking to the dance floor in a bid to scoop the coveted Glitterball Trophy. 

Talking about the upcoming series, Ranvir admitted that she is hoping gruelling training will help 'shed the pounds' and make her 'braver'. 

Candid: Ranvir Singh has admitted that she is hoping to lose weight from Strictly Come Dancing training after putting on a stone in lockdown (pictured earlier this month) 

She told Women's Own magazine: 'We don't all have the body confidence of Richard Arnold. The wardrobe department will have their hands full in more than one way. 

'I put on a stone in lockdown so if the training helps shed the pounds maybe I'll become braver as it goes on.'

Ranvir jokingly added: 'I'll be glad to get out of my Uggs and puffa jackets! I just hope I can remember to walk in heels, never mind dance in them.'

It comes after the presenter said that the Strictly contestants have not started training yet despite the new series starting in a few weeks, and moreover, the celebrities have not even met their training partners yet.

The 43-year-old was quizzed by her fellow hosts ahead of her appearance on the BBC One show which begins on October 24 with a one-off launch show on 12.  

2013 Strictly contestant Susanna Reid was shocked and said that usually by this point in the year, contestants are normally in the thick of training.

She said on Wednesday's Good Morning Britain: 'In a normal season, you would now be up to your eyeballs in training, in sequins, in glitter.' 

Ranvir replied: 'It's all happening a bit later. We can't - we've not met our partner yet.'

Training: Talking about the upcoming series, Ranvir admitted that she is hoping gruelling training will help 'shed the pounds' and make her 'braver' (pictured in March) 

She added: 'I am eating fewer Pringles if that counts towards training, but that's as far as it got.'

Piers Morgan asked Ranvir if she would like to be partnered up with anyone in particular and she said having a laugh was key. 

She said: 'Anyone who's got a sense of humour. The thing is, it's to do with the height. So I've got to figure out who the short one is.' 

Ranvir recently confirmed she had split from her husband, Ranjeet Singh Dehal, a few years ago. The pair share a son called Tushaan, eight. 

'We haven't even met out partners': Ranvir shocked Susanna Reid on GMB on Wednesday when she revealed the Strictly contestants haven't begun training yet 

Meanwhile, it was recently reported that Strictly will operate with a socially-distanced live studio audience when the series kicks off. 

The BBC One show confirmed it will return with an eighteenth consecutive series in September, and has since outlined the safety measures put in place to ensure it continues to be aired in front of its traditional live studio audience.  

Producers have revealed that family bubbles of four will be allowed to watch the show while it is filmed at Hertfordshire's Elstree Studios, while face masks and social distancing will be compulsory for all members of the public. 

She can't believe it: 2013 Strictly contestant Susanna said that normally at this point, contestants would be 'up to their eyes in sequins'

A step back in time: Susanna was paired with professional dancer Kevin Clifton when she appeared on the show in 2013 - she finished as a runner-up on the eleventh series 

Alleviating logistical concerns regarding the production of the show, a tweet posted on Monday read: 'To make the most if limited space we’ll have in the studio this year because of our social distancing measures, for the first time ever tickets will be allocated to groups of four, allowing you to come along as a family bubble / household group.

'We’ll be able to seat family groups of up to four people from the same household / social bubble at cabaret tables and in balcony seating. Cabaret tables and balcony seats will be allocated randomly, in advance of your arrival at the studio.' 

While the show attempts to move on following the coronavirus pandemic, it's understood that its annual Blackpool special - a favourite among fans - will not go ahead for the first time in its history.
