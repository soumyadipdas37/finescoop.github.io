She's courted controversy in recent years thanks to her risqué live show looks.

And Amanda Holden certainly didn't seem ready to ditch her revealing ensembles as she made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday.

The presenter, 49, slipped into a plunging gold metallic dress as she took her place on the socially-distanced judging panel, following by Alesha Dixon who opted for a bold multicoloured ensemble.

Wow! Amanda Holden certainly didn't seem ready to ditch her revealing ensembles as she made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday

Never shy of flaunting her incredible physique, Amanda looked incredible in her plunging gold gown with leaf-inspired detailing.

The dress also boasted a plunging front and tasselled sleeves and was certainly hard to miss as she took her place on the judging panel.

Meanwhile Alesha was a vision of colour in a gorgeous strapless tie-dye gown with a rainbow print.

The singer pulled her brunette tresses into corn rows as she strutted her way onto the stage.

This year marks the first time in BGT history that the semi-finals have been pre-recorded, and has also seen changes to the way acts will advance to the final.

Each semi-final will see eight acts take to the stage to win over the judges, with some performing via. Zoom due to travel and social distancing concerns. 

At the end of the show the judges l will choose one act to advance to the live final in October, and then viewers will get to choose the second act by voting.

This means that five of the 10 finalists will not be revealed until the series finale.

It's also been all-change on the judging panel, with Amanda, Alesha, David Walliams and Ashley Banjo each being seated on separate desks two metres apart. 

Due to Simon Cowell's absence Amanda has been promoted to head judge, and she was quick to joke she'll be backing 'musical theatre all the way.' 

Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. 

The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.  

Britain's Got Talent airs on Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.
