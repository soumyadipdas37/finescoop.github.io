Life returned to normal on Thursday as Felicity Jones returned to work just weeks after welcoming her first child.  

The actress, 36, was on set in Twickenham, south west London as she filmed scenes for her latest movie, forthcoming romantic drama The Last Letter from Your Lover.

The British star looked focused as the pair faced one another across a small table outside a local cafe during what appeared to be a heated exchange. 

In accordance with current health and safety guidelines, Felicity wore a protective face covering as she mingled with crew members while relaxing between scenes.

Set in 2003, The Last Letter from Your Lover follows Ellie, a London based journalist, as she discovers a handful of archived letters detailing a passionate love affair between two star-crossed lovers in the 1960s - prompting her to uncover their identities and find out what became of their story.   

Actors Shailene Woodley, Joe Alwyn and Callum Turner will also feature in the film, which will be distributed by Netflix, Studio Canal and SVENSK with an expected 2021 release date.

Over the past several months, the British actress hadn't been seen out and about, likely because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Felicity and Charles are known to be a fiercely private couple, who rarely publicly share details about their home life.

Felicity first confirmed her pregnancy news after debuting her baby bump at The Aeronauts premiere in New York City in December, 17 months after tying the knot with director Charles Guard.

A representative first confirmed that she was expecting to The Hollywood Reporter, after she debuted her bump at The Aeronauts premiere.
