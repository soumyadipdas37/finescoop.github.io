Bella Varelis' dad Steve delivered one of the most brutal hometown interrogations of The Bachelor's history on Wednesday's episode.  

And despite the shocking scenes which left red-faced Locky Gilbert stumbling over his words, the attention of viewers was diverted to Bella's very youthful-looking stepdad, Dean.

Fans could resist fawning over the 25-year-old's stepdad who they dubbed 'younger' and 'hotter' than the show's lead Locky.

While Steve did most of the brutal questioning, Dean, who is married to Bella's mother Kim, kept his cool as he sat at the dinner table.

Despite his quiet demeanour, viewers immediately noticed his presence with one jokingly tweeting: 'Is Bella's stepdad legally allowed to drink wine at the dinner table?'

Others added: 'Bella's stepdad looks younger than Locky' and 'Sorry did they just say that was Bella's STEPDAD???? Sis hes younger than locky.'

Another noted: 'The most attractive man to appear on the Bachelor is Bella's Stepdad #TheBachelorAU.'

Someone else hilariously pointed out the difference between Bella's father and stepdad, tweeting: 'Bella's stepdad is a f***ing dreamboat?! Wtf - no wonder Bella's real Dad is salty af at life #TheBachelorAU.'

Another echoed: 'No wonder Bella's dad is a salty b******... look at who his wife remarried! The stepdad is the age of Bella! #TheBachelorAU

Others praised Bella's mother for her other half, with one added: Um...Can we talk about Bella's stepdad? Talk about an upgrade. #TheBachelorAU.'

Despite Dean's newfound heartthrob status, he is very much private on social media. However, pictures prove that he is very much the family man and entirely devoted to Bella's glamorous mother, Kim.

Meanwhile, while Dean set pulses racing, Bella's dad Steve won no fans during the episode.   

Despite admitting he was nervous about meeting Bella's dad, the 31-year-old Bachelor immediately got him offside after he was busted kissing his daughter.

Things only went from bad to worse when the overprotective father pulled Locky aside for a one-on-one conversation.

 'I'm the good old-fashioned Greek overprotective father. It only takes this much for you to be my best friend,' he began in a monologue to Locky.

 'You will have to prove yourself this much if you want to be in my daughter's life. So, I hope you've been respectful to my daughter.

 'It's definitely gonna take a bit more work than cooking me one meal to make me trust you. And when it concerns my daughter, all bets are off.

 'I've got you at a bit of a disadvantage because, I mean, I was an avid Survivor fan, so I know a lot about you. I was a fan. Now I'm not.'
