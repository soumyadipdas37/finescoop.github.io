Top Republican election lawyer Ben Ginsberg - known for his prominent role in the 2000 Florida recount - wrote in The Washington Post that after four decades of looking for it, his party has found insufficient evidence of 'fraudulent double voting.' 

'These are painful conclusions for me to reach,' Ginsberg wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday, pointing to the 38 years he spent in the 'GOP's legal trenches.' 

Ginsberg wrote that each presidential election day since 1984, he and other Republican lawyers would be staffing precincts looking for signs of fraud. 

Top Republican lawyer Ben Ginsberg (photographed in 2012) wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post Tuesday saying that after spending nearly four decades looking for 'fraudulent double voting' his party has found little evidence it exists 

Ginsberg also writes that mail-in voting and absentee voting are essentially the same thing, despite President Donald Trump trying to differentiate between the two - so he can resist Democratic efforts for more mail-in voting, while also voting in Florida absentee 

Trump told a crowd in Wilmington that they should vote by mail and then also show up to the polls on election day. He's also warned Americans about 'tremendous fraud.' Ginsberg said it's like a 'firefighter who deliberately sets fires to look like a hero putting them out' 

Those lawyers would be a polling places and vote tabulation centers. 

And they'd look closely, too, at how mail-in and absentee ballots were handled. 

Ginsberg pointed to a number of President Donald Trump's recent statements, including how the president called mail-in voting 'very dangerous,' that there is 'tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality.' And his boast that, 'the only way we can lose... is if cheating goes on.'  

'The lack of evidence renders these claims unsustainable,' Ginsberg then wrote. 

'The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there’s no proof of widespread fraud,' he continued. 'At most, there are isolated incidents - by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not rigged.'

Ginsberg also pointed out that absentee and mail-in ballots are essentially the same thing.  

'Different states use different labels for the same process,' the Republican lawyer wrote. 

Trump has tried to differentiate between the two methods, as Democrats have pushed for widespread mail-in voting so Americans don't have to physically go to polling places on election day due to the pandemic. 

He's resisted those calls - in late March admitting, 'you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again' - while still requesting an absentee ballot from Florida so he can cast his 2020 vote without having to travel to his newly adopted home state on election day.  

'The president's words make his and the Republican Party’s rhetoric look less like [a] sincere concern - and more like transactional hypocrisy designed to provide an electoral advantage,' Ginsberg wrote. 

Ginsberg was also referencing Republicans' push for security measures like voter ID laws as a way to ensure that there's no fraud. Democrats have argued that this further burdens voters - including younger voters and voters of color, who often favor the Democratic Party.        

And Trump sowed greater confusion last week when he told a crowd of supporters in Wilmington, North Carolina that they should mail in their ballots and also show up to the polls. The White House tried to clean up Trump's comments, only to have the president repeat the idea several more times. 

'The president's rhetoric has put my party in the position of a firefighter who deliberately sets fires to look like a hero putting them out,' Ginsberg said. 

Ginsberg said that Republicans should reconsider backing measures that make it harder to vote. 

'Republicans need to take a hard look before advocating laws that actually do limit the franchise of otherwise qualified voters,' he argued. 'Calling elections "fraudulent" and results "rigged" with almost nonexistent evidence is antithetical to being the "rule of law" party.'
