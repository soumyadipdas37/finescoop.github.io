She's tipped to become one of Locky GIlbert's top two contestants in The Bachelor's upcoming finale episode. 

But Bella Varelis, 25, focussed her attention on a very different reality TV hunk  asshe stepped out with Gogglebox star Jad Nehmetallah in Sydney earlier this month. 

The marketing blushed and giggled like a schoolgirl as she and the 34-year-old Adonis left a cafe in Burwood with fellow Bachelor intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25. 

Look away now, Locky! Bella Varelis, 25, giggled like a schoolgirl as she stepped out with Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah, 34, in Sydney earlier this month

 Holding a take-away meal in one hand, Bella appeared unable to tear her gaze away from Jadas they enjoyed a lively conversation.  

Meanwhile, Jad appeared similarly delighted to be in the company of the stunning women. 

Looking casual yet stylish, Bella sported a white knitted jumper and blue high-waisted jeans.

Close: At one stage, Bella and Jad exchanged a warm hug 

Glowing: Holding a take-away meal in one hand, Bella looked like she was having the time of her life as she chatted away to the Gogglebox star 

She allowed her chocolate-brown tresses to fall neatly by her shoulders, and completed her ensemble with a black cross-body handbag. 

Bec, who is currently living with Bella in Sydney, dressed in a remarkably similar outfit to her famous housemate - also donning a slouchy white jumper and high-waisted blue jeans. 

In another sign of their unbreakable bond, Bec even wore her black cross-body handbag over the same shoulder as Bec. 

Will she approve? At one stage, the threesome were also joined by Bella's grandmother, who appeared keen to get to know handsome Jad

The pair reportedly spent hours browsing through trendy fashion store together, before dropping by a liquor store on the way home.  

Locky's frontrunner: Bella is rumoured to make it to the final two, while Bec is said to be eliminated prior to the finale 

The sighting comes amid reports that Bella and Jad have grown extremely close in recent months. 

The pair reportedly have a number of mutual friends, and have previously spent time together at events around Sydney.

While the meeting seemed innocent enough, Jad has been caught 'liking' a number of Bella's raunchy pictures on Instagram.

Bella remains one of the front-runners on The Bachelor, with online betting agency Sportsbet tipping her for second place, behind Irena Srbinovska. 

She had been an early favourite to win Locky's heart, but quickly fell behind nurse Irena, 31, as the season progressed.

In recent episodes, the former friends have clashed in the mansion as the competition for Locky's affection heats up.
