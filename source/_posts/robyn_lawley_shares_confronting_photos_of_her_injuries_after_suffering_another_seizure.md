Australian model Robyn Lawley has revealed that she suffered another seizure recently. 

On Wednesday, the 31-year-old shared a number of confronting photos on Instagram of her horrific injuries that she sustained during the incident. 

The mother-of-one then shared a rather inspiring and supportive message to fans, saying: 'Fellow sufferers you are not alone.'

'Sometimes social media can feel so intimidating, sometimes I can't stand it and other time I love when people can show their true selves,' Robyn's post began.  

'Even if it's as uncomfortable as this photo (fellow sufferers you are not alone).'

Robyn then said that she has started working on a new project about 'bodies' that has 'helped her heal tremendously.'

She added that in the images, she had a 'lovely satan eye.'  

In September 2018, Robyn spoke to Harper's Bazaar Australia about how she was embracing her scars, after suffering a seizure that June that caused her to fall two metres down a staircase in her New York home.

She landed on hard tiles on her face, resulting in a large abrasions to her forehead, lip and chin which required extensive stitches.

'My lip was so big I could barely talk, and I had so much pain, having lost my tooth, I couldn't eat or sleep,' said Robyn, who has lupus and APS (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome), an autoimmune disorder.

'I thought I didn't like my scars, but now I dig them,' the mum-of-one told the magazine. 'I think a chick with a scar is a bad**s. Scars are cool. They tell a story.'  

Robyn became the first plus-size model to appear in Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue in 2015 and she said in 2018 that she's determined to keep working while flaunting her 'Harry Potter scar' on her forehead.

The mark, according to the model, resembles the one the fictional wizard bears on his forehead in J.K. Rowling's novels.

'I can't get rid of it because it's a lightning bolt,' Robyn told Megyn Kelly on the US Today show in August that year.

'I'm too much of a fan to get rid of it and it's too much of a weird spot to have it happen.

'My nickname before the fall was actually Wizard already, so I had to keep it.'
