Tim and Anna announced their baby news back in April, and revealed they would be welcoming a daughter at a gender reveal party in June.

At the start of the year, Anna told The Daily Telegraph that the couple were hoping to have more than one child.

'It has always been on our mind but we are getting older, not that we are old but we want to have hopefully more than one kid,' she said.

'It is something we are both very keen on.'
