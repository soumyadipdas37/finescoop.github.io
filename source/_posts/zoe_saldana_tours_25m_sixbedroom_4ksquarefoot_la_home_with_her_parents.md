Avengers: Endgame action star Zoe Saldana attended an open house with her parents Aridio and Asalia where they toured a $2.5M house in Los Angeles on Thursday.

The half-Dominican, half-Puerto Rican 42-year-old wore a striped black midi-skirt with a white long-sleeve top, tan sandals, and a brown face mask to protect herself and others from the coronavirus.

Zoe took a look inside the 4K-square-foot property on West 6th Street located not far from the popular outdoor shopping mall, The Grove.

It's unclear if Saldana - who loves the Malibu lifestyle - was interested in living there herself or if she was just there for her folks.

The two-story home features six bedrooms and five bathrooms, which could easily fit the Quibi Princess Bride guest star and her family-of-five.

There's a beautiful breakfast nook featuring a small office space and shelves leading directly to the kitchen.

A halo light hangs above the living room surrounded by windows and dark hardwood floors.

A year ago, Saldana collaborated on the Italian 41-year-old's directorial debut, Keyhole Garden, about love and immigration on America's Southern border.

The Missing Link actress' real estate sighting came just ahead of the Adidas x Zoe Saldana collection of shirts, jackets, and shoes launching at Kohl's 500 stores and online next Wednesday.
