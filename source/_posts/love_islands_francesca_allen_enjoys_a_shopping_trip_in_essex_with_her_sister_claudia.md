She's rose to prominence on the reality series Love Island.

And Francesca Allen was every inch the doting aunt as she enjoyed a shopping trip in Essex with her sister Claudia and her baby nephew Tony on Wednesday.

Francesca opted for a laid-back look of a pretty yellow cardigan with floral embroidery teamed with light-washed jeans.

The reality star kept her raven tresses styled into loose waves as she strolled along with her sister, and completed her look with trainers and a pale blue handbag.

Little Tony looked utterly adorable in a blue babygro as Francesca carried him during the stroll, while Claudia pushed along the pram.

The Love Island beauty has recently returned from an enviable European break to St Tropez and Spain. 

She had been making the most of the eased lockdown restrictions during her recent breaks as she partied alongside pals and relaxed on the beaches. 

Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London last month.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday.

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner. 

In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is in a long-term relationship with Dan Edgar, 30.
