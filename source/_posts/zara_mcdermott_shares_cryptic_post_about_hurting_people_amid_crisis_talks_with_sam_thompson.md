Adding a sad face emoji, Zara's second post then stated: 'We have all hurt someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. We have all loved someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. 

'It is an intrinsic human trait, and a deep responsibility, I think, to be an organ and a blade. But, learning to forgive ourselves and others because we have not chosen wisely is what makes us most human. 

'We make horrible mistakes, it's how we learn. We breathe love, it's how we learn, and it is inevitable.'
