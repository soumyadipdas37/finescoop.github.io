Justin Bieber teased a 'new era' of his musical career as he announced his track Holy will come out this Friday. 

The Canadian pop star, 26, put on a rugged display in what looked like a still for the Chance The Rapper collaboration's music video, seen caked in dirt while clad in dingy overalls.

Justin appeared like he'd cleaned up his act later on, looking fresh while heading out for a jog around his Beverly Hills neighborhood on Tuesday morning.

New stuff: Justin Bieber teased the release of his song Holy with what appeared to be a music video still for the collaboration with Chance The Rapper 

Excited: Justin seemed to be in a good mood after the Tuesday teaser, looking fresh while heading out for a jog around his Beverly Hills neighborhood 

Bieber took to Instagram Tuesday morning to tease Holy and reveal the single's beautiful cover art, which showed a lone traveler walking down a dirt road. 

'New era. New single. It’s begins. #HOLY this Friday ft. @chancetherapper,' Justin captioned the post, adding his website just in case people forgot where to find him.

The song's titled seemed to suggest Bieber's plans to produce more faith-driven music. 

Justin - who just celebrated two-years of marriage to wife Hailey - also shared a shot from what appeared to be the track's music video, looking grimy as dirt and oil stains covered his face and his clothes.

It looked like Bieber was going for a working man's aesthetic, donning overalls and a white waffle weave thermal while slinging a well-worn utility bag over one shoulder.

On Monday he shared a behind-the-scenes snap wearing the same outfit while hanging out with WAP director Colin Tilley, all but promising fans the video will be a visual feast.

Bieber was back to his sporty but on-trend style while seen near his Beverly Hills home that same day.

Ready to run, he donned a pair of grey sweat-shorts with a white tee and blue and white Nikes. 

JB topped things off with a pale turquoise beanie and carried around some H2O to keep hydrated during the jog.

Justin has had a fairly busy quarantine. He didn't let lock down keep him from making new music, teaming up with Ariana Grande for the song Stuck With U in May.

And Bieber poked fun at his wilder days while starring in the music video for Drake and DJ Khaled's track POPSTAR, which came out earlier this monthv.

The devoutly Christian star reflected on how fame changed him in a recent Instagram caption, telling fans how his journey from small town boy to superstar affected him. 

'I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada,' he explained. 'I didn’t have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music. But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in.'

'My values slowly started to change. Ego and power started to takeover and my relationships suffered because of it. I truly desire healthy relationships. I want to be motivated by truth and love. I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them!'

'I want to walk in the plans God has for me and not try and do it on my own! I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad! I’m grateful that I can walk with Jesus as he leads the way.'

Holy is set for release Friday, September 18th.
