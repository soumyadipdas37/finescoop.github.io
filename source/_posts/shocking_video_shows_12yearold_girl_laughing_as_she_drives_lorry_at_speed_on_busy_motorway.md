This is the shocking moment a 'twelve-year-old' girl driving a lorry along a busy stretch of motorway.

The youngster was filmed steering the huge truck along the M1 near Dungannon, Northern Ireland. 

Footage of the moment appeared on social media on September 13, where it has been widely condemned.

As the clip begins, the lorry is filmed cruising down the motorway behind several other vehicles.

The camera pans to reveal a young girl sat at the wheel of the lorry using both hands to steer.

In the back of the cab is another child along with an adult man who watches over the girl driving.

The youngster appears calm and collected at the wheel as she speeds along the motorway. 

Footage of the moment appeared on social media on September 13, as the youngster drives along a motorway with cars up ahead 

At one point, the man moves out of the frame which distracts the young driver, who takes her eyes off the road to look at him.  

The jaw-dropping scene has left social media users shocked.

Sean Kearney wrote: 'What's wrong with this irresponsible man's head?'

Nigel Stroud added: 'Just wow! Cab full and no seat belts is bad enough but in the pilot seat too. She looks about 12 ffs.'

The shocking footage of the child is believed to have been taken near the same stretch of road where a young boy was also filmed driving a truck

Ann Gordon added: 'Oh my god what an idiot.'

And Tom Jacklin said: 'Absolute idiot. Not only the fact his underage daughter is driving, he has another child on the bed with no belt. Great parenting skills there buddy.'

It is the second time an underage driver appears to have been filmed driving a lorry in the same area. 

The shocking footage is believed to have been taken near the same stretch of road where another child was also filmed driving a truck.

A 37-year-old man was released after a video appearing to show a young boy driving a lorry on the M1 eastbound near Dungannon was shared online.
