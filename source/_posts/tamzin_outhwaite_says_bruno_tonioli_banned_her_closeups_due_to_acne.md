Tamzin Outhwaite has claimed that Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli refused to let her star in close-ups for an advert in her 20s, as she was struggling with acne.

The actress, 49, spoke candidly about her skin battles during an appearance on Celebrity Skin Talk with Scott McGlynn, and specifically her experience working with Bruno on an ad for Freixenet sparkling wine.

Tamzin explained that Bruno - who choreographed the advert - asked her to sit out on appearing in a close-up scene as her acne had 'come up really bad,' admitting the exchange left her feeling 'mortified.'

She said: 'There have been times in my life where I've had such bad acne that it's affected my work. 

'When I was in my early 20s, I was doing a champagne commercial as a champagne bubble. I had a little blonde wig.

'It was Don Johnson playing the piano. We were the champagne bubbles on the piano keys. We were in gold all-in-ones.

'Bruno was our choreographer, we were filming in Barcelona. One morning my acne came up very bad around my jaw line, it was raised and it couldn't be covered.

'I remember Bruno said, ''I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to sit you out for this close up shot''. It was because of my acne. 

'I was mortified. I do remember feeling mortified that something so physical on my face was stopping me doing what I loved.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Bruno Tonioli for comment.

Tamzin first rose to prominence when she joined the cast of EastEnders as fiery Mel Owen in 1998, after training at the legendary Sylvia Young Theatre School.

Meanwhile Bruno had long been known for his work as a choreographer before joining the Strictly judging panel in 2004, and is the mind behind some of the UK's most iconic advertisements. 

It comes after BBC announced that Bruno would not be appearing on the Strictly panel this series, due to travel restrictions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The star, who lives in Los Angeles and is a judge on Strictly's US counterpart Dancing With The Stars, will make several appearances throughout the series on the results show to offer his viewers on the celebrity couples' performances.
