A territorial magpie left puncture wounds in a four-year-old girl's face during an attack in Western Australia.

Evie Markey had blood pouring down her face after being set upon by the aggressive bird on Mandurah's western foreshore, 70km south of Perth.

Her mother Chantal Markey was putting her baby into a pram when the bird launched at her terrified daughter.

She said she first realised something was wrong when she heard her nine-year-old son Zac screaming out Evie's name.

When she turned around the bird was dive bombing the child.

Ms Markey said it was fortunate her daughter's injuries were only superficial.

'My first thought was "thank god it didn't get her eyes", because it was so close and she was bleeding a fair bit,' she told the Mandurah Mail.

'I just couldn't believe how aggressive this particular magpie was - it was lashing at her with its claws.'

The mother-of-four has warned parents to keep an eye out for aggressive magpies.

She witnessed the same bird attack another four people over the course of her time in the park.

One of its victims was a toddler.

'You could see the nest hanging over the car park and it was just going backwards and forwards getting people,' she said.

The mother-of-four wants the Mandurah City Council to install a sign warning locals about the magpie. 

Magpie swooping season came early this year due to the unseasonably warm weather.

At least 280 attacks have been reported across Australia since mid June, according to the Magpie Alert website. 

One of the more recent incidents involved a young boy who went viral after an aggressive magpie was filmed swooping him on Shellharbour Road in Wollongong.

His father Wayne Sherwood filmed the incident and posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Australia is beautiful but our native birds are killers. They'll eat your kids alive. Beware.'

Magpies swoop to protect their territory while chicks are nesting nearby.
