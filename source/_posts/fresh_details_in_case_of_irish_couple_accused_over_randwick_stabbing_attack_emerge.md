New details have emerged of an alleged stabbing attack on an Irishman who was found on the floor of a unit block with horrific injuries. 

Oliver Solan, 30, was allegedly dragged across a floor and dumped in a hallway with a punctured spleen and severed ear on Saturday night, a court heard on Wednesday.

Katie Murtagh, 26, and her 23-year-old boyfriend Patrick Earle have both been charged over the alleged attack along with two other men.

CCTV footage was released of a John Dunlea as police wanted to speak with regarding the alleged attack

Waverley Local Court heard that Earle and Murtagh has met Solan at the Coogee Pavilion, inviting him to their Young St unit where they allegedly took cocaine and drank alcohol, The Daily Telegraph reported.

An argument led to a fight between Solan and Earle, who suffered a dislocated shoulder. He then allegedly texted fellow Irish national John Dunlea, 27, on WhatsApp asking for 'muscle', the court heard.  

When Dunlea and two other men - Patrick Farrell and Christopher Morrison - arrived a short time later Murtagh allegedly let them into the unit block.

Solan was allegedly stabbed multiple times in the body and face before the three men ran from the scene, the court heard.

Police allege Earle dragged Solan's bleeding body into the hallway before fleeing with Murtagh.

Solan suffered a disfigured ear and a ruptured spleen - which was removed during surgery - and remains in a serious by stable condition. 

The court heard that at least one bladed weapon was used during the alleged attack. 

Dunlea handed himself in to Maroubra Police Station on Tuesday after officers made a public appeal for information on his whereabouts.
