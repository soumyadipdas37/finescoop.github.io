Bachelor finalist Bella Varelis has penned a heartfelt message to Locky Gilbert ahead of Thursday night's gripping season finale. 

The message was released on The Bachelor's official Instagram account. 

'Never in a million years did I think I would be stepping out of the limo that first night and meeting someone who I'd connect with on so many levels,' she wrote.

Bella said after a 'long' and 'incredible' journey, she can see herself with him, which she called 'simultaneously exciting and petrifying.'     

'After a very long, incredible journey and seeing Locky with my loved ones, I have a full heart and I can definitely picture my life with him.'

She finished by saying that Bachelor has been a 'wild ride' and she is 'grateful' for what she has learnt along the way. 

Romance: 'After a very long, incredible journey and seeing Locky with my loved ones, I have a full heart and I can definitely picture my life with him.'

'Regardless of the outcome, this has been one heck of a wild ride and I'm so grateful for the beautiful people I've met along the way and everything I've learnt about myself.'  

Fans are still guessing who will win Locky's heart. The two finalists are Bella and 31-year-old nurse, Irena Srbinovska. 

Paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro at the weekend. 

Love rival: Bella will go up against Irena 

One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.

The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away.  

While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.  

Competition for his heart? According to Sportsbet, Irena has the shortest odds paying $1.30. While Bella is paying out at $2.95. Here: Bella and Locky

Nathan, however, has repeatedly said the pair are just friends having known each other for a number of years. 

According to the latest Sportsbet odds ahead of the finale, Irena is paying out $1.30. While Bella is paying out at $2.95.       

The Bachelor season finale airs on Channel Ten, Thursday, 7.30pm
