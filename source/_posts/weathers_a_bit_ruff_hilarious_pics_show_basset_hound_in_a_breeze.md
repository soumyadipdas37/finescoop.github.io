This is the hilarious moment a wind-loving basset hound did his best impression of Dumbo with his ears flapping in the wind. 

Dewi the dog was out walking with owners in Aberystwyth, Wales, when a strong gust of wind turned the pooch into a famous pachyderm. 

The two-and-a-half-year-old hound loves sniffing the strong winds at the beach in the coastal town to get an overload of smells in the air.

Dewi the dog was out walking with owners in Aberystwyth, Wales, when a strong gust of wind turned the pooch into a famous pachyderm

But owner Kristy Blackwell, 27, was stunned when she noticed her faithful pup appeared to be doing his best impression of the iconic cartoon elephant. 

Charity worker Kristy said Dewi struck the bizarre pose on Upper Borth Beach as he tried to get over a groyne, a small wall built to slow erosion. 

She said: 'We noticed Dewi wasn't with us and when we turned around he was stuck on one of the groynes and couldn't get over it. 

'It was really windy and he really likes the wind because he likes to sniff it - he always sticks his head up when it's windy to get all the smells. 

'As he did this his ears and chops started to blow in the wind - they were rippling all over the place like a tube man we just burst out laughing and ran to try and take a picture before we carried him over.

'Kristy, and her partner William Bonner, share Dewi and Morris, a miniature dachshund.

She said: 'If you look up the definition of a basset it will say that they are clowns - this is very true of Dewi. 

'He makes me laugh every day without fail. He is cheeky, sassy and moody but also full of joy. 

'He's very lazy in the house but absolutely full of beans outside, especially if he catches a scent. 

'He likes to do what he wants to do and if he wants fuss from us or our other dog Morris, he will moan at you until you touch him.

Kristy said on social media Dewi definitely gets more attention than Morris. She said: 'But they both get equal attention from people in real life 

'He's really cuddly and makes a good substitute for a radiator. He also likes to emotionally blackmail you - if you don't give him fuss or take away a toy etc he will purposely go and sit on the opposite end of the sofa and stare at you and huff and puff like a child having a tantrum.'

'Morris and Dewi are best bros and protective of each other. They play fight every day and Dewi often lets Morris win. 

'Whenever Dewi drinks water he drops half on the floor and lots of it stays on his chops - Morris then sucks the water off of his chops rather than going to get his own fresh water. 

'Morris and Dewi are best bros and protective of each other. They play fight every day and Dewi often lets Morris win,' she said

'Dewi's favourite snack is ice and anytime we get the ice cube tray out is the there like a shot. 

'He hates the blender and will howl until it stops. He also doesn't like scary music and will howl so we can't watch any horror films or tense thrillers. He loves socks and can fit several in his mouth. 

'He has a very loud, deep howl which can scare people - but he just wants to play.'
