She is believed to have given birth to her third child in May.

And on Tuesday, Lara Worthington (nee Bingle) showed off her incredible post-baby body as she enjoyed a pilates class.

The glamorous former model, 33, shared a series of photos to Instagram, flaunting her figure in a tight black bodysuit as she completed her workout.

In one picture, Lara posed for the camera while holding a black gym ball in her hand.

The beauty stretched her toned physique in another and squatted as she posed for a third photo.

'One week into three weeks working with @fluidformpilates ... stay tuned,' the model captioned the post.

Lara lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Sam, who is best known for playing Jake Sully in the Avatar film series.

The couple secretly welcomed their third child earlier this year, a baby boy whose name they haven't disclosed.

Lara and Sam, who also share their two sons Rocket, four, and Racer, two, are yet to reveal when exactly the baby was born.

Lara had confirmed her pregnancy in November after months of speculation, telling Vogue Australia: 'I'm having a boy, early next year. It's my third boy and we're all very excited and very happy.

'I think any addition brings joy and happiness to the family, but more so when you can share it with the other boys. It's such a boy's club in my house!'

Lara and Sam began dating in 2013 and married in secret a year later.
