An Australian UFC fighter has taken a drastic step to stay fit during Victoria's coronavirus lockdown.

Jake Matthews, 26, enlisted in the Army and is now a fully-fledged Private after completing five weeks of basic training at the Kapooka Army Recruit Training Centre near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales.

He is set to take on his childhood hero, UFC legend Diego Sanchez, this weekend on Fight Island in Abu Dhabi in the biggest match of his career.

The welterweight told Sporting News the 16-hour days of non-stop training, with no phone or contact with the outside world, was just what he needed ahead of Sunday's massive fight.  

'Getting screamed at at 5:45 in the morning to get out of bed. Everything you think typical of army life is. Make your bed, brush your teeth, shave, then first class by 6:30 in the morning,' he said.

'Then it's theory, weapons, combat stuff, a few PTs here and there. From six in the morning till 10 at night they own ya, then you lay in bed and sleep.' 

But with 20 professional mixed martial arts bouts already under his belt and the years of brutal training that goes along with it, Matthews said he's used to the regimental and physical side of combat.

The Celtic Kid is coming off a five wins from his past six matches and says it will be difficult to juggle life in the military as well as his fighting career.

But the committed family man, who just had a daughter last year, is determined to make it work. 

'When my daughter was born something just clicked and I decided to go and enlist,' he told 7News.

'I think it's a bit of a protective instinct that came over me.' 

'It's something I've always wanted to do... I'll be looking for any deployments I can get.'

Upon his return from Fight Island, the Brazilian Jujitsu Black belt will go into self isolation for two weeks and then head back to base for another week of 'more advanced' weapons training.
