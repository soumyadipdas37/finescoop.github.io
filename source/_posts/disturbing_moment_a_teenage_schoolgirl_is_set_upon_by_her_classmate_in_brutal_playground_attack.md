The sickening video was taken at Tannum Sands State High School in Central Queensland and has been shared widely online.

She continues hitting the girl as she is on the floor before the victim manages to get up and attempt to defend herself.

But she is once again pushed to the ground as the attacker continues to punch her and kick her in the back.

The video was posted to Facebook by the victim's mother with the caption: 'Yet again my daughter has been bullied at school'.

'How many more f**king times does this have to happen.'

She continued: 'I am tired of dealing with this shit. It's time everyone knows what I am dealing with.'

The video has been shared widely on social media with many people shaming the video and calling the behaviour 'appalling'.

A spokesperson for the Department of Education told the Courier Mail the students had been dealt with by the school.

'The students in the video have been dealt with in line with the school's Responsible Behaviour Plan. No further details can be provided due to student privacy issues,' the spokesperson said.
