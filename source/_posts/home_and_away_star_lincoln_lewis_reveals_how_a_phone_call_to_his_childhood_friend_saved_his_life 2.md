Former Home And Away star Lincoln Lewis, 32, pulled himself out of the depths of depression by overhauling his diet and exercise regimen last year. 

And now, the actor has bravely spoken abut the darkest moments of his mental health battle, admitting that it was a phone call to his childhood friend that saved his life.  

Speaking to 9Honey on Tuesday, the House Husbands explained how he hit a 'low point' late last year, months after he was unwittingly involved in a catfishing scam that led to a woman's suicide.

Lincoln found himself spiralling into bad habits after learning that Melbourne woman Lydia Abdelmalek had stalked seven people for four years using fake profiles of the actor. 

'I was not eating right, physically my motivation was down, and work wasn't going well,' he told the publication.  

The blond recalled calling his childhood friend when his depression began to get the better of him.

'I said to [my friend], I don't really want to speak hypotheticals or whatever, but I said there was just one day where I woke up and was just done,' he explained. 

'I said to him, 'Mate, I don't care what we have to talk about. Just please talk to me.' And he just started talking,' Lincoln recalled. 

The star said the phone call reminded him of the importance of close, genuine friendships.  

Transformation: Not long after the phone call, Lincoln was approached by Men's Health to undergo a fitness transformation and to show off his results in a glossy editorial feature
