Controversial celebrity chef Pete Evans has sold his Sydney home for a whopping $3.5 million. 

The anti-vaxxer, 47, listed his Malabar mansion for sale in August, just months after selling his former home across the street.

According to Realestate.com.au, the five bedroom property sold at auction on Saturday for $166,000 above the reserve of $3.366.

The publication reports that the auction was opened at $3 million and there were three to five parties bidding on it. 

Property records show that Pete bought the property in 2014 for $1.27 million, before building a new house on the land.

The house, which Pete and his wife Nicola only finished building 18 months ago, boasts an open plan living area, three bathrooms and a double garage.

Chef's dream: Unsurprisingly, the property features an exquisitely designed kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances and a luxurious Caesarstone benchtop

Pete is reported to be selling up his Sydney properties amid his move to Byron Bay, where he is planning to open his Evolve Health Labs clinic. 

According to the company's Instagram account, the clinic will offer 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work' and 'cryotherapy'.

Pete owns a farm just a short drive from Byron Bay, and has been self-isolating on the property with his family for much of the COVID-19 pandemic.
