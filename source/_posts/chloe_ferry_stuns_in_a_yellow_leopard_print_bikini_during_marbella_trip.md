Chloe's thong bottoms were cut high on her waist to highlight her pert posterior, while she opted to go barefoot to walk to her sun lounger.

Chloe completed her look by shielding her eyes with a pair of chic shades, and she looked relaxed as she soaked up the sun.

Back in May, Chloe cried 'tears of happiness' as she thanked her followers for their support during her weight loss journey in an emotional Instagram clip. 

Despite her transformation, the beautician recently admitted she still doesn't 'feel great' about her figure.

Chloe said the trolls have got 'inside my head' after being inundated with cruel taunts calling her 'fat and ugly every day'. 

The reality star's girly getaway comes after she ignored speculation she had faked a trip to Ibiza and had instead secretly joined her ex boyfriend Sam Gowland, 25, in Dubai.

It had recently been reported that the star had back together with her co-star ex - despite being in the throes of filming Celebs Go Dating. 

A source told The Sun the former-couple were said to be 'reconnecting'; but fans also connected the dots.

An insider said: 'Chloe's taking it really slowly and she's keen to keep it quiet as her friends will all be furious after all the drama. It's a chance for them to reconnect.'

MailOnline contacted Chloe and Sam's representatives for comment at the time.  

The present season of Celebs Go Dating signed Chloe up amid what appeared to be the complete end to her and Sam's romance.

The couple - who have been on/off for years and had a turbulent relationship since first getting together in 2017 - were believed to split for good in February.

This is thought to be what prompted her to sign up for the virtual version of the celebrity dating show.
