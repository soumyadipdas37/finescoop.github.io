Nina Dobrev is clearly smitten with new boyfriend Shaun White.

But that didn't stop the Vampire Diaries star from poking fun at her Olympian beau as she celebrated his 34th birthday on Thursday.

Dobrev, 31, shared a very candid snapshot of the pair together along with a jokey caption dedicated to 'the most untalented, humorless, least althletic [sic], least coordinated, least gifted and least favorite person.'

'Happy birthday @shaunwhite,' she went on, continuing the gag by telling the world record holder: 'Hang in there. one day you will accomplish something. #dontgiveup.'

The artsy photo, which looked like it was shot on film, showed the couple in a silly moment. Shaun hid one eye behind a water bottle while Nina stuck her tongue out.

Later she shared a quick snapshot to her Instagram Story that had just a quick 'HBD' up top.

It's clear that the pair are enjoying their time together.

Not hiding their love: Late last month the two piled on the PDA during a vacation to Tulum, Mexico with friends

Throughout the trip Nina and Shaun were seen shamelessly kissing, flirting and cuddling for all to see.

Over the weekend Dobrev said 'Adios' to their fabulous time in Mexico, posting a cheeky selfie along with the caption: ''All good things must come to an end. time to go home...'

Nina and Shaun were first seen together in late March. They went Instagram official with their relationship in late May.

Insiders say that White is totally different from Dobrev's past boyfriends, who have included her Vampire Diaries co-star Ian Somerhalder, actors Austin Stowell, Glen Powell and most recently filmmaker Grant Mellon.

'Shaun is a departure from previous guys Nina has been with,' a source told E! News in March. 'Her friends are pleasantly surprised.'

But it seems like the snowboarder is the perfect fit for the adventurous actress, who talked to Cosmopolitan about her ideal man back in 2013, not long after her split from Somerhalder.

'You either have chemistry or you don't, but a lot of what attracts me is a guy's mind and humor and talent,' she said.
