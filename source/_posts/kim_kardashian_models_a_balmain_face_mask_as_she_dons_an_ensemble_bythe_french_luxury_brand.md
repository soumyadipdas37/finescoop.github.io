Kim Kardashian has been doing her best to hold her family together amid husband Kanye West's ongoing mental health struggles and frequent Twitter firestorms.

But the 39-year-old KKW Beauty took her mind off the chaos by slipping into a head-to-toe Balmain ensemble personally sent to her by the French luxury brand's creative director Olivier Rousteing. 

'Balmain Barbie,' wrote Kardashian as she modeled the high fashion fit for her 185million Instagram followers on Tuesday.

Make it fashion: One item that really excited the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was the Balmain face mask

Before trying the outfit on for size, Kim gave her fans a closer look at the various pieces she was generously gifted.

'Oh my God! Look at this Balmain. Look at this turtleneck with the gloves and the biker shorts and the bag...' she narrated, while panning her camera over the luxury goods.

One item that really excited the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was the unique Balmain face mask.

'And, you guys, there is a mask! It is so cute,' she exclaimed. She closed out her video by thanking Olivier for the 'amazing' gift.

Vintage: Kim explained that the pattern featured on all of the pieces is a vintage 'B' pattern that was created by the brand's founder Pierre Balmain 'years ago'

Moments later, Kim returned to Instagram donning the fashion-forward get-up, which she revealed was from the brand's newest collection. 

She explained that the pattern featured on all of the pieces is a vintage 'B' pattern that was created by the brand's founder Pierre Balmain 'years ago.'

Then, panning her camera down, Kim showed how each clothing item flatteringly clung to her curves.  

Her lengthy brunette hair was styled into a mod half up, half down 'do that was curled at the ends.

To match her dramatic outfit, Kardashian sported a full-face of makeup, which included a sexy cateye flick, a full brow, plenty of bronzer, and her signature nude lip shade.

The Balmain ensemble included the brand's iconic pointed shoulders and skintight long sleeves.

The arm length gloves amped up the glamour, as did the gold hardware on the outfit's coordinating handbag. 

In an Instagram Story video, Kim eagerly placed the Balmain face mask over her made-up face and flashed a peace sign at the camera.

Shortly after sharing the various photos and videos to her Instagram, some of Kim's closest friends and family took to the comment section to gush over her look.

'Come on Barbie let’s go party,' wrote older sister Kourtney, 41, in reference to Kim's 'Balmain Barbie' caption.

The reality star's high fashion display came just days after a source claimed to Us Weekly that she is 'deeply disappointed and sad' about husband Kanye's ongoing mental health struggles.

Kim is reportedly worried about the 'vicious cycle' her husband is experiencing, after a series of bizarre Twitter rants and posting a video of him appearing to urinate on one of his Grammys statues.  

They went on to say how Kim knows it is difficult for Kanye 'being isolated and alone'.

'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn't healthy for Kanye ... She doesn't care about the tweets, that is Kanye being Kanye. The mood swings and the manic episodes that are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'

Another insider, who spoke to Us Weekly last Wednesday, said that Kim is  'continuing to support' Kanye.

'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he is bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help,' the source explained. 

Kim is well aware that Kanye often struggles with his mental heath, so the KKW Beauty CEO wants him to know that she is doing her best to empathize.

'She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.'

Despite offering support privately, Kardashian has not publicly commented on her husband's latest antics. 

Kim and Kanye, who wed in 2014, share four children, daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, five, and Psalm, one.
