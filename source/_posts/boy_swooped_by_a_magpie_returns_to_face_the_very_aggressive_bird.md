A boy who was attacked by an aggressive magpie has bravely returned to face the angry bird with his father. 

Max Sherwood, 10, and his dad Wayne were riding their bike and scooter near their Shellharbour residence on the NSW south coast recently when they were set upon by the magpie. 

An initial Instagram video, which has since gone viral, captured a terrified Max screaming as he was riding his scooter down the hill while the irate magpie continually swooped at his back and head.

Just hours after his first encounter with the irritated bird, Max bravely elected to face his fears with the help of his dad. 

The pair filmed themselves starting back up at the top of the hill before riding past the magpie on their bikes. 

'I hear it,' Max can be heard saying seconds before the bird swoops down and hits his dad's back. 

Seconds later, the pair are seen laughing as the magpie swoops into view behind them, hitting Wayne multiple times before again taking aim at Max. 

Max can then be seen smiling and laughing as they triumphantly ride away from the bird.  

Speaking to Sunrise on Wednesday morning, Max revealed his father first ventured down the hill and was promptly swooped on by the territorial bird.  

It was then left to the youngster to face his fears. 

'Just when I start going down, the magpie started swooping me and I was just screaming as loud as I can,' the 10-year-old said.

The initial footage was shared by Brown Cardigan on Instagram and quickly garnered more than 500,000 views.

'This video perfectly sums up Australia at this time of year it's f**ked,' one man commented.

'Wow this opens some old scars,' another person said. 

The Australian Magpie is one of the world's most complex songbirds

It can be found across Australia and lives near trees and open areas 

The magpie is black and white and feeds on insects and larvae 

Magpies will often perform a loud flute-like song in pairs or groups

The birds are known to become aggressive during their breeding season and attack humans or animals near their nests 

Magpies swoop to protect their territory while chicks are nesting nearby.

The swooping season began earlier this year due to breeding beginning ahead of schedule due to a mild winter.

Some have observed the birds may be more aggressive as they feel particularly threatened by people wearing face masks.

Birdlife Australia's national public affairs manager, Sean Dooley, said the birds would not be able to recognise people they had previously identified as a friend or threat. 

'A magpie may know you and know that you're okay, but when you're wearing a mask they may not be able to recognise you,' Mr Dooley told 3AW last month.

Mr Dooley claimed magpies could recognise and remember up to 100 individual people through facial recognition.

He explained magpies would not be able to tell people apart and could swoop any mask-wearing person that they associated with bad experiences.

'If they're seeing more than 100 people a day and they can't work out who is who they will just start to target those types of people.

'It might be the colour of the mask that makes them go for you,' Mr Dooley explained. 

Magpies will most often swoop when they feel threatened and want to protect the young in their nest.

'It's usually a six-week period and they don't all do it at exactly the same time, so any particular pair might swoop for six weeks between September and November,' Dr Kelly said explained.

At least 625 magpie attacks (swooping magpie pictured) have been recorded since June

Dr Kelly warned if had you encountered an aggressive magpie in a particular spot it would most likely return to the same location this year.

'They always go back to the same site so if you had a swooping pair last year you can bet your bottom dollar they're going to be back again this year,' she said. 

Australians are advised to avoid eye contact and detour around magpie territories whenever possible.

'If you're riding a bike have a flag on top, they'll usually go for the tallest point, you can also have an umbrella if you really need to,' Dr Kelly said.

As magpies are native to Australia, those affected by the swooping are forbidden from taking any preventative action which may harm the birds or disturb their nests. 

 *If you are swooped while riding, get off of your bike as many injuries are caused in falls during an attack.

*Keep an ear open for their distinctive warble

* Stay still and calm to provoke a further attack.

*Wear sunglasses and large wide-brimmed hat to protect your head and eyes.

*Face the magpie as they tend to attack from behind. Keep facing the bird as you walk out of their territory to avoid be swooped as soon as you look away.
