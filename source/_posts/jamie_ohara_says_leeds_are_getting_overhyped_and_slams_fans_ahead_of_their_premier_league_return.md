On talkSport, former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford and O’Hara were discussing where Leeds will finish this season with the former saying he fancies his side to finish inside the top-half.  

O'Hara replied: 'Top half? I'll start this off and I think they are getting way over-hyped. Way over-hyped with everything that's going on with Leeds right now.

'This is your first season back in the Premier League and I'm hearing people talking they are going to be top six. People are talking Champions League.
