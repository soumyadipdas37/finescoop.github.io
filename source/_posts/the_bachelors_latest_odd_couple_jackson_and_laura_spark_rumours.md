She failed to find love with Locky Gilbert on The Bachelor, but could Laura Calleri have a new admirer? 

Posting to Instagram on Wednesday, the 24-year-old shared a photo of herself wearing a Louis Vuitton face mask. 

The reality star, who has previously described herself as a 'snob,' explained that it was a gift from Bachelor in Paradise star Jackson Garlick.

Jackson, who rose to fame on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette last year, has a laid-back disposition seemingly at odds with Laura's high-maintenance personality.

If the easygoing pie maker is dating the designer-loving brunette, then it would hard to imagine a more unlikely reality TV couple.

'@Jacksongarlick you know the way to a gals heart,' Laura captioned the post.

During her brief stint on the Channel 10 dating show, Laura made no secret of her love for Louis Vuitton. 

As she arrived on the red carpet, the Perth-based beauty left Locky speechless when she asked him if he'd lavish her with luxury goods.

After stepping out of the car, she introduced herself and said: 'When we're together, how much will you spend on my birthday present?'

Locky explained: 'I'm not massive on spending a heap of money on something. I like more doing a gesture or going and doing something like out in nature.'

'Why? What's the craziest gift you've been given?' he asked.

Laura then revealed that she had previously received a Louis Vuitton purse as a birthday gift, leaving the suitor shocked.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
