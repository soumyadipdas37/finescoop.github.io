Facebook is testing a new feature that allows users to share Instagram Stories directly to their Facebook Stories.

For now it's being limited to a small number of users who, according to The Verge, will receive a pop-up window explaining that 'Now your followers can choose to view your Instagram Story from Facebook.'

Only Facebook followers who also follow you on Instagram will be able to see your Instagram Stories.

Users' Stories will be color-coded by profile picture, so viewers know where they came from - Facebook Stories have blue circles, while Instagram Stories carry that app's pink-and-orange border.

Facebook is testing a new feature that allows users to share Instagram Stories directly to their Facebook Stories. Users must have their accounts linked and opt in to the experience

Regular Instagram posts can already be automatically posted to a user's Facebook feed and the company has been encouraging users to cross-post Stories for some time, as well.

The new option was first reported by Twitter user @ec_wife on Friday.

A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the plan in a tweet to industry insider Matt Navarra.

'We're testing a new feature that gives people the option to view Stories from Instagram on Facebook, making it easier to view moments from people you care about, regardless of what app you're using.'

Users must have their accounts linked to share Instagram Stories on Facebook and need to opt in to the experience.

Facebook friends who do not follow you on Instagram will not see your story.

'This feature respects all privacy settings, and people on Instagram can choose to not have their story visible on Facebook,' the rep said.

Users can tell whether they're looking at someone's Facebook or Instagram story based on what color border is on the profile photo: Facebook Stories have blue circles, while Instagram's have that app's pink/orange border.

The company said it will be listening to user feedback about the limited test before rolling the feature out on a larger scale.  

Stories are a huge asset for Instagram, with half of the site's one billion users regularly interacting with Instagram Stories.   

In June, Instagram began testing a new layout that put Stories front and center on the home screen. 

According to reports, the social media site was working on a 'See All Stories' button which would allow users to view all short-term posts at once in a grid format.  

The new sharing option is just latest move in the company's plan to integrate its platforms and dominate the social-media space. 

Last year Mark Zuckerberg confirmed plans to unify Facebook's and Instagram's messaging infrastructure with WhatsApp, which Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014.

Facebook began merging Facebook Messenger and Instagram in August.

That same month, Instagram introduced Reels, a challenger to TikTok that allows users to make 15-second videos incorporating music, filters and effects.
