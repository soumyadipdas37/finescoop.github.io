Grammy winner Justin Bieber just couldn't wait to sink his teeth into a slice of pizza and decided to eat it while strolling on a street in Beverly Hills on Thursday.

Obviously then the 26-year-old pop star was unable to protect himself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a mask, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for all public outings on June 18.

As of Thursday, there have been over 256K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,305 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

Justin sported in his signature 'slob-rity' athleisure attire including a long sleeve black shirt, matching joggers, unlaced sneakers, and an olive-green Nike beanie.

Earlier that day, Bieber was seen outside the $25.8M Beverly Park Mansion he bought in August alongside a security guard.

The Canadian crooner flashed double peace signs before jumping inside one of the many black SUVs parked nearby.

Justin's street sighting came hours before he'll officially debut the music video 'movie' for his new song Holy featuring Chance The Rapper, which premieres at midnight.
