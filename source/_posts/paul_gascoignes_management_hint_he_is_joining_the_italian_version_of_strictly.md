Plans: Earlier this year, Gascoigne revealed he had been offered a spot on the Italian dance show and was deciding whether to take it (2019 show still) 

While his agent, Katie Davies, told the publication: 'It is a very long show in Italy. It runs for about four hours. So we will have to look at how we would do it. We don’t know if it would be for a full stint, or a shorter format.'

MailOnline has contacted Gascoigne's representatives for comment.

It's been an exciting year for the sporting star and earlier this month he was reportedly left 'over the moon' after learning he's set to become a grandfather for the first time.

The former England star learnt that his stepson Mason, 30, is expecting his first child with partner Jaimee Wyatt after his stepdaughter Bianca shared the news with fans on Instagram.

Surprise! It's been an exciting year for the sporting star and earlier this month he was reportedly left 'over the moon' after learning he's set to become a grandfather for the first time (stepchildren Mason, 30, left, and Bianca, 33, right, pictured)  

Paul is stepdad to Mason and Bianca, and also shares son Regan, 24, with his ex-wife Sheryl.

Bianca let slip the news when she shared a snap with her brother, writing: 'I'm gonna be an Auntie! My brother Mase is having a baby!!' 

A source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Gazza is over the moon. It’s just the bit of good news he needs. He can’t wait to be a grandad.'

Parents! Mason's partner Jaimee Wyatt revealed their impending arrival on Facebook, gushing they 'couldn't be any happier'

According to the publication, Mason's partner Jaimee shared the news with fans on Instagram, writing: 'Couldn't be any more happier. We are having a healthy beautiful baby.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Paul Gascoigne for further comment at the time. 

It came after Paul was left devastated when thieves broke into his flat and stole £140,000 worth of jewellery, after Piers Morgan shared a snap of him at a recording of his ITV series Life Stories.  

Among the items stolen were treasures belonging to his late father, which the sporting star told the Sunday People 'meant so much to him.'   

The raiders' haul included a £2,000 gold cigar cutter and watch both owned by his late father John, according to the Mirror.  

They also took a £40,000 gold diamond-encrusted watch bought with his first pay cheque from Tottenham and a Championship medal from Glasgow Rangers.

Gascoigne went to London to support lifelong friend Vinnie Jones, 55, while he filmed his Life Stories chat. 

Piers told the Sunday People he was 'sorry to hear' about the burglary and said the least he can do is 'buy him some new steaks.'
