Customers are rushing to Aldi Australia to get their hands on a tasty product that has launched in stores.

The supermarket chain is now selling packs of miniature churros for customers to enjoy at home.

Each 170-gram packet is priced at only $3.99 and the crispy churros themselves are filled with delicious chocolate.

The pastry product is bound to please both children and adults alike, and the small portion size provides guilt-free eating.

The product was spotted by a Melbourne mum who shared the news to the Aldi Mums Facebook group – which has more than 142,000 members.

'Um, okay!' mum Danni said and posted a photo of the Urban Eats Mini Churros packets.

The social media post excited other customers online who were eager to try the new tiny churros themselves.

'What! I was there today and did not see these! I'll be back on the weekend,' one woman said.

'Good price too - will check them out,' another said, and a third joked: 'Better book in more gym sessions!'

This isn't the first time the product has been released in stores, as some customers said they bought multiple packets of the miniature churros last year.  

Aldi sells an abundance of additional products customers have previously gone crazy for.

The $3.50 Mediterranean Delite garlic dip has been used to add flavour to roast vegetables, while the Choceur Liviano Hazelnut Creme bars is said to be a 'dupe' of Kinder Bueno chocolate bars.
