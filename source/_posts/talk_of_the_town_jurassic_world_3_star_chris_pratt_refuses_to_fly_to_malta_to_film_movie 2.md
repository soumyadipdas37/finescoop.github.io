I'm afraid I have some disappointing news for movie fans longing for a blockbuster to lure them back to cinemas.

Filming of the £180million Jurassic World: Dominion, starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt has been hit by more delays.

I hear that Chris, 41, is so worried about a coronavirus outbreak in Malta, where some of the scenes of the sixth instalment in the franchise are being shot, that he is refusing to fly out there and is telling others on the film that it's not safe.

On-set sources say that the Hollywood heart-throb is 'petrified' of picking up Covid-19 so is 'leading the charge' not to join the crew in Malta until it is safer.

Filming began in February at Pinewood Studios but was halted as the pandemic took hold. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the boss of a theme park of cloned dinosaurs that is plunged into chaos when they escape. Chris Pratt plays a dinosaur expert charged with saving the day

One says: 'There have been some cases of Covid among the behind-the-camera staff following an outbreak in Malta.

'Chris thinks the sensible thing is to not get on the plane to go there.'

Filming began in February at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire but was halted just two weeks later as the pandemic took hold.

Bryce plays the boss of a theme park of cloned dinosaurs that is plunged into chaos when they escape.

Chris plays a dinosaur expert charged with saving the day.

Kate Middleton's designer: I thought OBE note was tax demand

Most people are cock-a-hoop when they are nominated for an honour. But one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designers, Amanda Wakeley (pictured: receiving an OBE from Prince Charles in 2010), has revealed that she was terrified to open the letter confirming she would receive an OBE – because she thought it was a tax demand

Most people are cock-a-hoop when they are nominated for an honour. 

But one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designers, Amanda Wakeley, has revealed that she was terrified to open the letter confirming she would receive an OBE – because she thought it was a tax demand.

Amanda says: 'Getting the letter was very funny, as a brown envelope arrived at the business. It was just before Christmas and our accountant gave it to me. 

'I thought, 'Oh God, here we go, it's a tax demand which I really don't need.'

'I tore it open and I couldn't believe what I was reading.'
