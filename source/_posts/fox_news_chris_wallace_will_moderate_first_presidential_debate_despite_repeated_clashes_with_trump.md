Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will moderate the first debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, it was announced Wednesday - despite a history of public clashes with the president.

Each of the debates will be moderated by a single reporter, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced – the second will be moderated by NBC News White House Correspondent Kristen Welker and the third by senior executive producer and political editor at C-SPAN Steve Scully.

Fox News host Chris Wallace will moderate the first presidential debate

None of the three journalists were listed as Trump’s desired reporters to moderate the debates, which his attorney Rudy Giuliani released earlier this month.

Although a Fox News personality did make it into the lineup, Wallace is one of the only Democratic hosts on the right-leaning news network.

The sole vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and California Senator Kamala Harris, which will take place between the first and second presidential debate, will be moderated by USA Today’s Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page.
