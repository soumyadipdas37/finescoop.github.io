Olivia Attwood appeared to be in good spirits as she toasted her TOWIE exit with a few drinks during a cocktail class.

The former Love Islander, 29, looked sensational as she tried her hand at mixing a few drinks while cutting a casual figure in a fluffy purple jumper and ripped jeans.

Her appearance comes after Olivia revealed she had decided to leave Essex and join her fiancé Bradley Dack in Manchester on Wednesday's episode of TOWIE.

The TV star appeared to be concentrating hard as she learned how to make the perfect cocktail while filming Olivia Meets Her Match for ITVBE 

Making sure to look her best, Olivia added a few designer touches to her laid-back outfit by donning a Chanel necklace and bright pink handbag by the designer.

Olivia shocked her TOWIE castmates during Wednesday night's episode by finally making the decision to leave Essex and 'prioritise' being with Bradley. 

During the show the blonde beauty explained how she was feeling conflicted about spending so much time away from her beau and being with the girls in Essex.

Revealing her decision at the end of the show, Olivia said: 'I've got everything I've ever wanted waiting in Manchester, a whole life I'm missing out on. 

'These last few weeks saying i feel conflicted and feel I've come to realisation i need to be up there a bit more permanently. It's the right thing to do, it's just sad isn't it.'

Olivia's revelation left Nicole Bass and Clelia Theodorou in shock with the former Love Islander having to tell them to not cry and struggling not to give them a hug, which she couldn't do due to social distancing rules.

Nicole could be seen getting emotion as she said: 'It's so hard. I'm happy for your future but I'm gonna miss you so much.'

Before walking away, Olivia said: 'The last year has been amazing, so many highs and some of the best times of life. Some people are going to miss me, and some not so much. 

'But I know who I am and I've got pals for life. So girls, there's no time like the present. I'm gonna leave now before any more drama starts.'   

The beauty had spoken about her tricky decision of whether to stay with her pals or move to be with her beau during the show.

At one point she explained how she didn't 'want to be that girl who drops my whole life for a boy, well my fiancé now.'

And while sitting around the pool with the girls, Olivia explained that things with Brad were 'really good' with them wanting to move house and plan their wedding.

However she added: 'We need to prioritise our time, I can't choose house while I'm down in Essex all the time running around sometimes behaving like a bit of an idiot... 

'I've got my fiancé in Manchester and should be by his side really, not drinking in pub gardens arguing with little girls.

'It's a real dilemma in my mind, I ned to work out what my priorities are and if they're in the right place... I need to think, I feel like I'm here there and everywhere and right now nobody's winning.'

Reaction: TOWIE has received 176 Ofcom complaints after Sunday's episode which included a heated row between Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 25, and 19-year-old Chloe Brockett (pictured)

Accusations: Several fans took to Twitter to say they were feeling 'uncomfortable' during the scene and accused Olivia (pictured) of bullying her younger castmate

Olivia's comment of 'drinking in pub gardens arguing with little girls' was in reference to her recent argument with Chloe Brockett.  

On Sunday's show the two beauties ended up arguing when they waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex, Jack McDermott. 

When Chloe asked Olivia why she called her a 'poisonous little creature', the former Love Island star replied: 'I thought you was vile and poisonous. You went at Clelia last year like a Jack Russell. 

'I do feel a bit sorry for you, you haven't got any friends your own age, you're hanging around girls a lot older than you and you're angry. I don't know why you're so angry but you are.

Having their say: The row first occurred when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex boyfriend, Jack McDermott

'The thing is I thought the other day "maybe was what I said a little bit too harsh" but the way you've conducted yourself, I'm bang on.'

Chloe told her: 'All I'm saying is, when you called me a 'poisonous little creature', you don't know me'.

TOWIE has since received 176 Ofcom complaints after viewers said they were left feeling 'uncomfortable' during the episode. 

Olivia Attwood, alongside castmates Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 25, were all accused of bullying 19-year-old Chloe.
