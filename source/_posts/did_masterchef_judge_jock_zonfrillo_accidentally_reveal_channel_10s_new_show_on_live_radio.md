Jock Zonfrillo may have accidentally revealed that Celebrity MasterChef is returning to Australian screens after more than 10 years. 

The 44-year-old was speaking about Junior MasterChef on Fifi, Fev and Byron on Friday when he made the apparent slip up on live radio. 

Radio host Brendan Fevola asked Jock: 'Byron's a great cook and he wants to know if there's going to be a senior MasterChef?'

'You can apply for the Celebrity MasterChef!' Jock replied.

'He won't get in that one!' Brendan said, joking that Byron isn't famous enough.   

'You heard it here first, Fi and Fev, Jock just said I was a celebrity. So cop that!' Byron said.  

Remember this? Olympic swimmer Eamonn Sullivan (pictured) won Celebrity MasterChef in 2009, but the spin-off was not renewed for a second season 

Celebrity MasterChef Australia previously aired for one season in 2009, recruiting names such as Rachael Finch, Michelle Bridges and George Negus. 

Olympic swimmer Eamonn Sullivan won the series, which drew more than one million viewers each episode - but it was not brought back for a second season. 

Meanwhile, the MasterChef franchise in the UK has aired a celebrity spin-off every year from 2006 to 2020.

This year's season of MasterChef, known as 'Back to Win', owed much of its success to featuring high-achieving contestants from previous seasons.  

Celebrity MasterChef could also capitalise on familiar faces by bringing personalities from other Channel 10 shows like The Bachelor, Survivor, and Neighbours.

In the meantime, the third season of Junior MasterChef will air later this year.
