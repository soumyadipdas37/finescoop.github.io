Dr Alex George has returned to Instagram after taking a two-week break from social media following the tragic death of his younger brother Llyr. 

Taking to the site on Monday to share a snap of himself smiling, the Love Island star, 30, announced he was back after 'taking some reflective time offline'. 

His 20-year-old brother, Llŷr George, tragically passed away in July following a battle with mental health. 

Moving forward: Dr Alex George has returned to Instagram after taking a two week break from social media following the tragic death of his younger brother Llyr

In the emotional caption he penned: 'Hi everyone - I am back. Taking some reflective time offline these last few weeks was really important for me. 

'I have been spending time with my family and friends, living in the present and trying to focus on the things that matter most. Working in A&E has also been a helpful focus, the love and support from my friends and colleagues has meant the world to me and I am thankful to them all.'

Signing off he said: 'I'm sure there will be ups and downs to come but I am glad to be back on here - this community we have built together means a lot to me and I am grateful for you all. Let's do this.'

Immeasurable loss: Dr Alex's 20-year-old brother, Llŷr George, tragically passed away in July following a battle with mental health

Last month Dr Alex explained his decision to take break as he thanked fans for their support since Llyr's death. 

The A&E doctor shared a candid snap of himself on the beach as he explained his reasons for deciding to leave social media. 

He penned: 'I have decided to take a few weeks off social media. With everything that's happened it's important for my mental health that I take some time offline. 

'I am focusing on my family and friends as well as looking after myself. 

 

Time for reflection: Last month Dr Alex explained his decision to take break as he thanked fans for their support since Llyr's death

'I'm also going to spend some time thinking and working on a few projects that are close to my heart. 

'Without doubt A&E will continue to keep me busy too. Thank you for your support and see you all in a few weeks. Stay safe and be kind to yourselves.

Fans poured in with their messages of support and encouraged the Love Islander to look after himself. 

Shocking: Dr Alex was recently left shocked when a follower took issue with him for being on social media so shortly after Llyr passed away following a battle with mental health

It came after the NHS doctor admitted he was 'hanging on by a thread' after a troll criticised him for being on social media in the wake of his brother's death.  

Last month Alex took a screen grab of the exchange, in which the person responded to his seaside picture with the comment: 'your brother is dead get off social media.'

Sharing his anguish at the response, Alex penned: 'Imagining being this person. I'm holding by a thread and you get people like this.'

Response: In his Instagram story, the medic explained to his fans why he was on social media, as he thanked them for support during this tough time

In his next Instagram story, the medic explained to his fans why he was on social media, as he thanked them for support during this tough time.  

He wrote: 'I am honest and open with you all. The good, the bad and the ugly. There is so much that isn't shared online of course. So many of you are so kind and message me each day with well wishes.'

He concluded: 'I often post to let you know I am still going strong x.'

The doctor also recently shared a Just Giving page that he set up in memory of his late brother, which he posted on his Instagram story in hopes that his followers could donate.

Just an hour after mentioning the fundraiser to raise money for mental health charities, Alex thanked his fans for their immediate contributions: 'Wow, you guys are being so generous. Let's do this!' 

Alex confirmed that his brother's funeral took place at the beginning of August. Llŷrwas just weeks away from getting into medical school and following in Alex's footsteps.
