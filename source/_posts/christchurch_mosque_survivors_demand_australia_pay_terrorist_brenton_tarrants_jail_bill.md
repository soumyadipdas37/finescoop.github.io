Survivors of the Christchurch mosque attack have demanded Australia pay for Brenton Tarrant's jail bill.

The terrorist was jailed for life without parole after he murdered 51 people and injured dozens more in a massacre at the Al-Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre on March 15, 2019.

Now, victims of the brutal attack want Australia to pick up the bill for incarcerating the 29-year-old in Auckland's Paremoremo Prison, which comes at a price of NZ$4,930 (AUD$4,512) per day.

John Milne's 14-year-old son Sayyad was killed by Tarrant in the racially motivated attack and he believes New Zealanders should not be charged for his actions.

'I think Australia needs to pay the total cost for what we've spent already, they need to pay that plus ongoing. They need to cough up big time,' he told RNZ.

'There's a big bill out there for this now, he's Australian, not a Kiwi, we shouldn't have to pay for any of it.'

Tarrant grew up in the northern New South Wales town of Grafton before moving to New Zealand in 2017 and settling in the South Island town of Dunedin.

The first two years of his sentence alone will cost $NZ3.59 million ($A3.33 million), with the entirety of his time in jail set to cost tens of millions of dollars.

Abdul Aziz chased Tarrant out of Linwood Islamic Centre following the attack and said the money being spent on his imprisonment could be much better spent. 

'We can do a lot better things than spending it on that coward,' he said. 

New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters wants Tarrant to serve his sentence in Australia and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was open to the idea. 

'I know all Australians and New Zealanders want to see this character locked up to never see the light of day again - I agree with that,' he told Sunrise.

'Whether he is held in New Zealand or Australia, we're open to that discussion.' 

There would need to be some changes to legal arrangements between Australia and New Zealand for the transfer to happen because the two countries do not have a prisoner transfer agreement.

Such an agreement would allow New Zealanders jailed in Australia to also be sent home. 

Another option would be for Canberra and Wellington to reach a one-off agreement just for Tarrant.

In either case, Tarrant would have to serve the same sentence of life without parole unless New Zealand consented to a discount which is extremely unlikely, ANU legal expert professor Don Rothwell told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Morrison said he and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern would work through the issues involved.

'It has a lot of implications, these sorts of decisions. The Prime Minister of New Zealand and I will talk about those issues,' Mr Morrison said. 

'Mostly, we're concerned about what the views of the families would be, of those affected, and we want to do the right thing by them.'

'There has been no request made for that (transfer), I should stress.'

Tarrant's sentence is the harshest penalty ever doled out by a New Zealand court and guarantees he will die behind bars regardless of which country he is in. 

On Thursday, Prime Minister Ardern said Tarrant's crime was one that the country 'has never seen the likes of before and this is a sentence we've never seen before'.

'It gave me relief, to know that person will never see the light of day,' she said. 'The trauma of March 15 is not easily healed, but today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist behind it. 

'His deserves to be a lifetime of complete and utter silence.'
