Tame Impala have announced they've had to postpone their Australian and New Zealand tour for the third time because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement to the media on Tuesday, the Australian band revealed their upcoming shows had now been rescheduled for the end of 2021.

The original concert dates were scheduled for April this year, before being pushed back to December 2020.

Now they are being pushed back by an entire year, with the new dates scheduled for December 2021.

'The shows, originally planned to be held in April of this year and rescheduled to December, remain unable to go ahead due to the constantly changing nature of the pandemic, and associated Government directives in Australia and New Zealand,' they said in a statement.

The tour will begin in Auckland on December 5, before moving onto Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, and then finishing up in Perth on December 18.

Described as 'one of Australia's greatest musical exports', the band released their latest album, The Slow Rush, earlier in the year.

The Perth-based band is fronted by multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker, who writes, records, performs, and produces all of the music.

They released their debut album in 2010, and soon found global success, landing a Grammy nomination in 2012.
