Actress Arizona Muse hit the beach on Sunday with her husband in Venice.

The British-American star, 31, had wowed at the 77th Venice Film Festival the night before in a stunning red ballgown.

But it was a different look entirely the next day as she hit the beach with Boniface Verney-Carron, whom she married in 2017.

Arizona, 31, slipped into a caramel string bikini and flaunted her porcelain complexion as she strutted along the shore.

She wore her chestnut mane around her shoulders, wet from the ocean.

She took a dip with her husband, with the two packing on the PDA in the water.

Boniface wore olive and cream patterned swimming shorts.

Arizona welcomed her first child Nikko, 10, with fashion stylist and former flame Manuel Quintana when she was 20.

The couple eventually split, and she married Boniface three years ago, welcoming a daughter with him at the end of 2018.

The couple were enjoying a day to themselves, however, having been promoting Arizona's new film, Marx. 

Speaking to Town and Country magazine recently, the beauty reflected on being a young parent.

She said: 'I don’t know what it’s like to be a 20-year-old who didn’t have a child. I loved having Nikko.

'He was like a doll. I was a child myself and it was an "ignorance is bliss" situation.'

Arizona candidly admitted her reasoning for marriage being particularly meaningful to her, given that Nikko 'doesn't have a relationship' with her ex-fiancé Manuel.

She said: 'It meant a lot to me to get married. Especially because I already had a child who doesn’t have a relationship with his dad.'

News: Arizona announced the arrival of her baby daughter by sharing an adorable snap of her laying alongside the newborn in November 2018

Touching on how she burnt herself out by working and parenting in the early days, she told: 'By the time Nikko was three, I was totally exhausted.'

Arizona battled on because she feared that if she took time off her career would disappear - which caused her massive amounts of stress that she 'was under, every single day, for years'.

She added: 'I probably needed to take some time off, but I was stuck in this fear cycle.
