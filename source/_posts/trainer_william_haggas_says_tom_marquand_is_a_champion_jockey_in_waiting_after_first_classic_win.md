Trainer William Haggas believes Tom Marquand is a champion jockey in waiting after the 23-year-old took another huge career step with his first Classic win on Galileo Chrome in the Pertemps St Leger.

Marquand’s success at Doncaster on Saturday topped a campaign which started when he won Group One races on Haggas-trained Addeybb in March and April in Australia.

Haggas, who uses Marquand more than any other rider, said: ‘He is talented and very enthusiastic. He is top class and will be the champion one day.

‘The wins in Australia were big for all of us, including Tom. His career has gone on from there.’

Stamina won Galileo Chrome the St Leger as he edged clear in the final strides after a battle with runner-up Berkshire Rocco.
