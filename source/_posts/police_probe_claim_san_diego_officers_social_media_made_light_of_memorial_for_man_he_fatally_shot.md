A police officer allegedly posted an image on social media making light of a man who he fatally shot's memorial.

San Diego police officer Jonathon Lucas and his partner Tevar Zaki shot Leonardo Hurtado Ibarra, 25, after he allegedly pulled a gun on them in downtown San Diego on June 27.

Ibarra underwent emergency surgery at UC San Diego Medical Center but died from his injuries on June 29.

After the shooting, Lucas was placed on administrative leave while police investigated, but he allegedly posted images on Instagram of Ibarra's makeshift memorial with laughing face emojis on Thursday.

San Diego police spokesman Lieutenant Shawn Takeuchi said police Chief David Nisleit immediately ordered an internal investigation into the matter.

Screenshots of the posts show pictures of the 'Justice 4 Leo' memorial with crying-from-laughing emojis on top and the word '#eastside' written. 

San Diego police are investigating whether Lucas posted the picture. 

United Against Police Terror San Diego said the post was sent to them by an anonymous source, who claimed the pictures were posted by Lucas.

San Diego police spokesman Lieutenant Shawn Takeuchi told the San Diego Tribune: 'We hold all officers to a high standard, including conduct that is done off duty or on personal social media accounts.'

Ibarra's shooting sparked outrage across San Diego at the time, with protesters taking to the streets to express their anger at police brutality on June 28.

He was spotted walking down a sidewalk on the 1200 block of Sixth Avenue just after 5.45pm on June 27. 

Lucas and Zaki, who have been with the force for four years, believed he matched the description of a man involved in a June 21 robbery because of his face tattoos, so they tried to approach him.

He dropped his shopping bags and ran away, the San Diego Police Department said. 

While Ibarra ran, he reached into his waistband, pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the officers, police said.

Bodycam footage released by San Diego police a day after the shooting shows an officer approach Ibarra and say: 'Hey man we need to talk to you for a second. Stop, stop.'

A car alarm rings as the officers approach Ibarra's slumped body on the sidewalk. 

The officers said they gave him first aid while officers waited for paramedics to arrive. 

Police said they found a loaded revolver wrapped in a bandana under Ibarra's body when he was handcuffed.

Gabriela Gudino, Ibarra’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of two of his children, said police shot Ibarra 11 times. San Diego police said the number is still being investigated.

The protests came after wider protests in the city (pictured on June 4) over the killing of George Floyd

She told NBC7: 'It was excessive force. That was just too many times. Nobody deserves that.

'I get it, one, two – but 11 times? I think that’s not right. Even if he pulled out a gun, there are other ways to try to stop him.'

San Diego Police are continuing to investigate the social media posts and shooting.

Ibarra leaves behind a 3-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 6 and 8. A fundraiser for his family has raised nearly $7,000.
