Zara Tindall looked the picture of a proud equestrian today as she beamed horseback during the Burnham Market International Horse Trials in Norfolk.

The Queen's eldest granddaughter, 39, sported a double breasted navy tailcoat with white jodhpurs and black boots which she paired with a black top hat as she sat horseback on Gelding Class Affair. 

The royal, who won a Silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics, was competing in the dressage test and was clearly in her element during the competition.

Zara, a mother-of-two, looked cheerful as she rode the horse, while later striking a stern look of concentration on her face 

Sticking to a regal look, the daughter of Princess Anne wore minimal make-up, and tied her long blonde hair up under her helmet and hat.

The former Equestrian World Champion looked at home atop her horse, a Grade 1 Irish Gelding who she first rode in 2017.

While Zara competed this morning, her score and position in the tournament is yet to be revealed.

It comes as Zara and her former Rugby pro husband Mike Tindall both tested negative for Covid-19.

The couple, who have spent lockdown at their home on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate, were filmed taking the tests at the stables on their farm in Gloucestershire. 

Both were relieved the tests came back negative, and the Tindalls are believed to have since travelled to Balmoral to see the Queen.

Zara and Mike took the BioSure tests in their role as ambassadors for Manchester-based cyber technology company VST Enterprises.

They then uploaded their results onto their VHealth Passport - which has been developed to help get sports fans back into major events and stadiums - where they appeared within seconds.

Zara winced as the pin-prick test was administered, which detects coronavirus antibodies and was performed under Covid-19 safe practice by Latus Health Care. 

The couple are taking part in a pilot scheme called FANS ARE BACK, which is being put to the government to get football, snooker, rugby, golf and equestrian sports fans back into stadiums and major sporting events next month.
