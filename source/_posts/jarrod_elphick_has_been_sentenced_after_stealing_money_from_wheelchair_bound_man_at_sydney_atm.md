Jarrod Elphick, 20, was sentenced on Thursday after he snatched $100 out of the hand of Julian Stewart as he withdrew his disability pension

The man who shocked Australia after he robbed a vulnerable wheelchair-bound pensioner at a Sydney ATM has escaped a jail term.

Jarrod Elphick, 20, was sentenced on Thursday to an 18-month Community Correction Order involving 150 hours of community service after he snatched $100 out of the hand of Julian Stewart as he withdrew his disability pension. 

Footage of the unbelievable incident went viral in May after the CCTV footage was released by police. 

Mr Stewart has revealed he now lives in fear and is not surprised Elphick has been arrested again for a separate offence involving his own mother.

'I don't go to an ATM by myself anymore. I always make sure there is someone with me, I can't bear to have it happen again,' he said.

'I don't carry money anymore.

'Every time that I go to an ATM now, I still am frightened. Although I've managed to be very positive about the whole thing it did have a very large impact on my life.

'As far as I look at it, I made the mistake. I went in there when they were sitting there.'

Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal Elphick was re-arrested following an incident involving his mother almost three weeks ago.

While on bail for the offence involving Mr Stewart, Elphick fled his home after a row with his mum about what time he would be served dinner.

Court documents reveal he repeatedly banged his head against the wall, creating a small hole in the plaster and yelled 'incoherently' towards his mother.

Elphick then headbutted the corner of the hallway in the kitchen twice which caused damage in two separate areas.

Forty-five minutes later police intercepted Elphick half a kilometre from the home, arresting him for breaching bail conditions which had prohibited him from leaving home without his mum. 

He was taken to Liverpool Police Station where police were unable interview him due to 'erratic' behaviour.

Elphick faced Magistrate Thomas at Liverpool Local Court on Thursday for sentencing after pleading guilty to 'destroy or damage property' following the incident on August 25, as well as the 'steal from person' charge relating to the ATM robbery.

He was sentenced to an 18-month Community Correction Order and required to perform 150 hours of community service work for the theft charge.

He was also convicted for the 'destroy or damage property' charge but no further penalty was imposed.

A Final Apprehended Violence Order was also made prohibiting him from going within 100 meters of where his mother lives or works for a period of two years. He is also prohibited from assaulting or threatening her.

The cowardly act hasn't stopped Julian Stewart from turning the experience into a positive one.

He believes there was a reason for him being born with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy – in that he has a great gift and purpose in life.

'A lot of disabled people think that way and we don't want people to feel pity on us. We want to be part of society, and a productive part of society and give people a lot of great and positive messages,' Mr Stewart said.

After receiving thousands of dollars in donations he has started the Julian Stewart Foundation and also launched a podcast.

'Right now I'm working with down syndrome people, taking them out during the day.'

'I do a live podcast, about three days a week where we talk about making people's lives better.

'It's just been awesome, the sorts of things I've been able to do since all of this happened.

'There was a lot of very kind people that donated money to me, but I didn't want to take the money for myself. I've been able to use some of that money to help disabled people, which is a very special thing,' Mr Stewart told Daily Mail Australia on Saturday morning.

As for Elphick's 150 hours of community service – Mr Stewart hopes it would have to do with helping disabled people.

'People with a disability like me need extra protection, so I need the law to protect me.

'In saying all of that, I do know that the person who committed this crime is a very young person and I don't necessarily believe that putting them behind bars is the right thing.'

He has previously offered to talk to his perpetrators and would even extend his hand out to forgive Elphick but doesn't believe he has shown any remorse.

'I offered to come and talk with him. I do agree that young people make mistakes. I hope that he can turn his life around.

'It's only made me a better person. It's only made me a better and stronger person. It's allowed me to meet and show a lot of people just how a bad situation can become a very good one.'
