The Premier League has announced 10 positive coronavirusÂ test results were recorded in the latest round of testing ahead of the 2020-21 season.

The announcement is the first time the number of positive tests has reached double figures this season, although the names of the players and staff involved have not been revealed.

A Premier League statement said: 'The Premier League can today confirm that between Monday 21 September and Sunday 27 September, 1,595 players and club staff were tested for COVID-19.

The total count of positive COVID-19 tests in the Premier League has jumped from three to ten

'Of these, there were 10 new positive tests. Players or Club staff who have tested positive will self-isolate for a period of 10 days.

'The Premier League is providing this aggregated information for the purposes of competition integrity and transparency.'

The international break scheduled to accommodate Nations League fixtures on the weekend of October 10 means that any affected players are likely to miss only one league match.

Players involved in those internationals and the busy forthcoming Carabao Cup schedule will also have to sit out those games.

Three people tested positive in the previous week, when 1,574 tests took place.
