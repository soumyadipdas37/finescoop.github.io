It's been a little over four years since Match of the Day viewers were treated to seeing Gary Lineker present the show in nothing but his underwear, but could it happen again next year?

Back in 2015, the former Leicester striker claimed he would present MOTD 'in just his undies' if Leicester won the league.Â 

Against the odds, the Foxes did exactly that six months later, and Lineker kept his promise.Â Â

Gary Lineker has joked that he may have to 'wash his pants' with Leicester currently flying high

Lineker presented the first Match of the Day of the 2016 season as promised in his underwear

And now Lineker has hinted he might have to do it again, with his beloved team looking good.Â 

'So, Leicester are top of the league. Better wash my pants,' he joked as he signed off on Sunday's Match of the Day programme.Â 

Leicester are in good shape as they are top of the league, but admittedly we are only two games into the season.Â

Leicester are currently top of the league, but we're only two games into the new season

They earned a 3-0 win over newly promoted West Bromwich Albion on the first day of the season.

Then, they followed that up on Sunday with a 4-2 victory against Burnley, coming from behind at the King Power Stadium.Â Â 

With the current might of Manchester City and Liverpool, it seems unlikely Leicester will be able to repeat their feat this season, however the odds were severely against them in the 2015-16 season as well.Â 

They face City in the league next, in what will be their toughest fixture in this early part of the season. They will also play a resurgent Arsenal in the EFL Cup on Wednesday.
