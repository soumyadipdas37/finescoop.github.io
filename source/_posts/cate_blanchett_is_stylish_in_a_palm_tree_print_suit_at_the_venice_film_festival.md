She's been showing off her style credentials at the Venice Film Festival in Italy.

And Cate Blanchett continued to impress as she donned a palm tree print suit as she arrived at the Hotel Excelsior on Monday. 

The actress, 51, looked sensational in the relaxed ensemble as she paused to have her temperature checked by a security guard outside the building.

Cate's two-piece suit boasted wide-leg bottoms and a more structured jacket with a pyjama style collar and three red buttons down the front.

She paired the statement outfit with some cream platform shoes and a chic pair of large sunglasses.

Making sure to stay safe during the current coronavirus pandemic, the star also donned a mask and opted for a pale pink one to complement her outfit.

The blonde beauty wore her locks straight her day at the Venice Film Festival and appeared to be in good spirits as she waved to fans watching on.

Australian beauty Cate is heading the jury at the Venice Film Festival during a historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.

'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she told the AFP in regards to her thoughts on the matter.

'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.'

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'

Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.

Since arriving at this year's festival, where attendees have been seen sporting face masks due to the pandemic, Cate has rocked a range of stylish ensembles.

On Sunday night she donned another suit while walking the red carpet ahead of a screening of film Khorshid.

Cate looked sensational in a crisp white shirt which boasted large cuffs and an open-collar.

She tucked the shirt into matching white slacks and added an eye-catching black and gold sparkling tuxedo jacket with velvet lapels for extra style.
