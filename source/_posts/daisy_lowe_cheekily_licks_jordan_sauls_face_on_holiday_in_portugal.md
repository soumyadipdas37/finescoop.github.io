She dated three men while in lockdown but Daisy Lowe seems to be smitten with her handsome new property developer boyfriend, Jordan Saul

The model went Instagram public with Jordan on Wednesday, sharing three snaps of them on holiday together in Ericeira in Portugal. 

Daisy, 31, looked incredible wearing a black bikini from Les Girls Les Boys as she cosied up to her man, with her licking his face and him gently biting his cheek.

Ericeira is a seaside community on the western coast of Portugal and is considered to be the surfing capital of Europe.

The new couple were first pictured together on a boozy day out in a north London park in mid-July and then went on a date to the zoo together.

Jordan is an animal-obsessed, adventure-loving guy, whose Instagram handle is @jordanjaysaul - he works as a new home consultant for an estate agent.

Daisy, daughter of Bush rocker Gavin Rossdale and Pearl Lowe, seemed enamoured with Jordan, just a month after she was linked to musician Christian Langdon.  

Christian is also the ex-husband of Cat Pierce from The Pierces. The rocker was a member of Arckid in the 1990s and early 2000s. 

He also goes by the nickname 'Leggy Langdon', thanks to his statuesque frame. 

Daisy's spokesperson previously told MailOnline that her relationship with Christian was platonic after she was spotted with a ring on her engagement finger.

Before that, Daisy had been dating singer Jack Peñate, 35, for six months, but they split in March, with Daisy saying she 'couldn't see a future' with him

The beauty had found romance with Jack after splitting from Cameron McMeikan, 24. 

Daisy and Cameron dated for almost a year before reportedly ending their romance over their six-year age gap.  

Getting on well: In July, Jordan shared a video of his recent trip to the zoo with Daisy on Tuesday, where the model can be seen feeding some deer
