Irena Srbinovska has been the favourite to win Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor since the very first episode.

And it appears the 31-year-old nurse is showing all the signs of being the right match for the former Australian Survivor star.

According to dating guru Sharon Draper, Irena and Locky are 'very compatible' and at the same stage in life - the perfect combination for a long-lasting relationship. 

Sorry, Bella! A dating expert has revealed why The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (right) has found his perfect match in Irena Srbinovska (left)

'They have good energy, seem very compatible and also hold shared core values for what is important in life,' explained Ms Draper, eharmony's resident dating expert.

Irena has remained cool-headed despite the drama in the mansion, an attribute that has undoubtedly given her an advantage in the race to win Locky's heart.

'Irena doesn't seem to be one to get too involved in any drama or attention seeking activity,' Ms Draper observed.

Match: 'They have good energy, seem very compatible and also hold shared core values for what is important in life,' explained Sharon Draper, eharmony's resident dating expert

'She trusts her bond with Locky and focuses on her own experiences with him. They had chemistry from day dot, which hasn't shown any signs of dying down either.'

It comes after Locky denied rumours he's no longer dating his winner.

The adventure tour guide - who will decide between Irena and Bella Varelis during Thursday night's finale - told TV Week on Monday he was '110,000 per cent in love' with his chosen contestant.

Trust: 'She trusts her bond with Locky and focuses on her own experiences with him. They had chemistry from day dot, which hasn't shown any signs of dying down either,' she continued

'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to reveal his girlfriend later this week. 'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.'

Directly addressing speculation he split from his winner during COVID-19 lockdown, he added: 'I'm so happy and all I want to do is tell people how great she is.'

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10

Numbers game: Irena (right) is the favourite to win Locky's heart on The Bachelor, with odds of $1.30 as of Monday morning. By contrast, marketing consultant Bella (left) is sitting at $3.25
