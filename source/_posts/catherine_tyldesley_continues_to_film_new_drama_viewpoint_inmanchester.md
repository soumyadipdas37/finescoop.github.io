She has joined a star-studded cast to shoot the upcoming series.

And Catherine Tyldesley made sure she wrapped up warm as she filmed for new ITV police drama Viewpoint in Manchester on Wednesday.

The former Coronation Street star, 37, wore a thick grey padded long-length padded jacket and shearling-lined ankle boots to shoot scenes.

Yet despite looking low-key for her outerwear, Catherine wore a glamorous ensemble underneath for filming.

The soap star showcased her toned figure in a brown leather-look midi skirt with a lighter coloured shirt tucked in.  

Catherine styled her brunette locks into a curly blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up for filming. 

The star appeared to get stuck into shooting as she was later seen putting on an animated display inside a restaurant for one scene.

Catherine was also joined by Alexandra Roach, who will be taking on one of the lead roles as Zoe Sterling, and Dominic Allburn.  

Viewpoint, one of the ITV's first post-lockdown series, recently saw production suspended after a positive coronavirus test on set. 

But things were swiftly back to normal thanks to the safety protocols in place with the stars back on set and filming this week.

Viewpoint, which is headed up by Fleabag director Harry Bradbeer, follows a tense police surveillance investigation into a close Manchester community.

Noel Clarke will take on the role of surveillance detective, DC Martin King, as he investigates missing primary school teacher, Gemma Hillman, played by Amy Wren. 

This is just one of the new TV projects Catherine has been involved with since quitting her role of Eva Price on Coronation Street in 2018.

Catherine's outing comes after she furiously took to Instagram on Monday to call out a social media troll who cruelly claimed she has 'big fat legs'. 

Referencing her strict workout schedule, the actress proved she's proud of how far she's come from being a size 22 teen as she hit back with: 'I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.'

The Strictly Come Dancing star addressed the naysayer directly as she said: 'It's not often your Auntie Cath gets trolled, I'm very lucky like that. I've got lots of wonderful, positive people in my life.

'You do get the occasional twonk, so to the guy yesterday who said I had 'big fat legs', babes, I've been training these legs for seven years. This s**t don't wobble, and I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.

'So things just got really awkward, really fast, didn't they? God bless ya, darling. Find the light, come on.'
