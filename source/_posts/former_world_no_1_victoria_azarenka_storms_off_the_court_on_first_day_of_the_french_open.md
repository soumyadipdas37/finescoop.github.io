Former world No.1 Victoria Azarenka stormed off the court at the French Open after venting her frustration at being left to freeze on the sidelines. 

Just 24 minutes into the tournament at Roland Garros, Azarenka and her opponent Danka Kovinic were forced to take shelter under umbrellas as a mist of rain, strong winds and cold temperatures disrupted their game. 

Azarenka, who began the game wearing a coat, was left sitting in 'freezing' temperatures as officials decided how to proceed amid such conditions.

'You guys are joking right? You don’t see what is happening? What are we doing here?', she said to tournament official Claire Wood.

Wood tried to reassure Azarenka, saying she understood how bad the conditions were but had hoped to get the match back under way.

Azarenka was quick to respond, saying: 'You do know but you guys are not playing so you have no idea about how the conditions are.

'I’m down to play whatever, you know I am not complaining here but you know this is getting a little bit ridiculous. 

Wood, who was waiting for further instruction from the tournament referee, asked Azarenka to wait on court to see if the rain would pass. 

However, the two-time Australian Open champion had little patience and refused to sit in such conditions. 

She said: 'I’m not sitting here because I’m going to get frozen. 

'No, I’m not waiting here a couple of minutes because I’m cold. It’s eight degrees... I live in Florida, I’m used to hot weather.' 

Continuing to highlight her frustrations, Azarenka asked Kovinic if she was happy to sit on the court as they await further instruction. Her opponent replied 'no'. 

As a result, both players walked off the court before they were technically allowed to do so.
