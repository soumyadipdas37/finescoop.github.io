Charlotte Hawkins has discussed her GMB co-host and friend Kate Garraway's heartache over her husband Derek Draper's COVID battle. 

The breakfast show host, 45, detailed Kate's anguish and explained: 'It's been horrific for her and her family. She's been going through such a tough time and she's continuing to go through a tough time.'

Former Blair lobbyist Derek, 53, who shares daughter Darcey, 14, and son Billy, 11, with Kate, has been in hospital since March slowly recovering from his battle with COVID-19 and earlier this month Kate was able to visit him for the first time.

She said: 'It's been horrific for her and her family. She's been going through such a tough time and she's continuing to go through a tough time. We don't know what's around the corner. Everybody at GMB is there for her in whatever way she needs...

'It's really hard all I want to do is hug her. I wanted to show her that I was thinking of her so I sent a rose called Growing Hope...

'She loves her garden and hopefully planting it will grow some hope gfor them. It's been a heartbreaking situation for her. I keep everything crossed that Derek is going to be OK.

Kate has been candid about her heartbreaking struggle while her co-stars have been vocal in their ongoing support for her plight. 

Earlier this month, she confirmed that she is taking a week off from Good Morning Britain to help Billy, get ready for secondary school while taking care of Derek as he continues his recovery from the deadly virus. 

Explaining that she would be taking some time off, Kate said: 'I'm actually not here next week, I'm taking a bit of time off to help Billy get sorted for secondary school and Darcey as well get ready for school. And also Derek, look after things on that.

Showing her appreciation, she added: 'I just want to say thank you to all of you for absolutely being brilliant since I've come back through challenging times. Everyone here, you, Ben, everyone on screen and off screen you've been amazing.' 

'Everyone talks about ITV and TV being a brutal business and it's not, it's a proper family you've all been amazing. Thank you so much.'

Kate's co-host, who was making his presenting debut on the show, replied: 'You know that we love you and we've all got your back on this show.
