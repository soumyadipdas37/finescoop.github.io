Lovingly crafted it may be, but this birthday cake was hard to swallow for its mortified recipient.

Samantha Stone's mum gave her a sponge replicating the crash site where she wrote off her new Mini days before her 21st.

Alex, 41, invited the whole family round for a surprise party, where she brought out the cake revealing the embarrassing mishap.

Samantha, a special effects make-up student, said: 'I was so upset about losing my car so she said she would make me a special cake.

'The lights went out and in front of everyone she brought it out while everyone was singing happy birthday. 

'I was like ''Oh my god'' then I just burst into laughter. She's such a comedian.

'The worst part is my grandad who bought me the car knew nothing about it. He was just happy that I was ok.' 

Samantha, of Nottingham, bruised her knee in the crash when the car skidded off the road and hit a tree.

She added: 'I didn't realise what it was at first but as soon as I realised what she had done I nearly died.

'My grandad was right next to me but had no idea the car he brought me was ruined.

'He just put his head in his hands and asked me what it was about, so I had to explain to him that I crashed it.'

Samantha said will never be able to forget it as her crafty mum made sure to take pictures of her cutting the cake - which is a mirror image of the crashed car picture Samantha sent to her mum when she crashed it.

Samantha, said: 'It was really funny and it brought everything into perspective, I was really upset about the car but we've all had a laugh about it and it's a birthday cake I will never forget.'
