She's been living it up with the likes of singer Mary J. Blige and radio personality Angie Martinez for her milestone birthday.

Showing off her toned midsection and killer curves, the screen star took a walk on the wild side in the barely-there one-piece, which featured cut-out detailing throughout.

Back in July, Taraji revealed she'll give her fans more Empire content by signing on to an untitled spin-off featuring her famous character Cookie Lyon.

The project is part of a two-year first-look deal she signed with 20th Century Fox Television, which will give the network the first pick at any projects she develops.

Sources familiar with her new stint said it could bring closure to Empire, which ended for good two episodes shy of its intended series finale after production was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

When co-creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong announced that the show would not receive its intended series finale, they seemingly left open the possibility of a spin-off to help conclude the story.

The new show will follow Cookie as she relocates to Los Angeles, and may feature appearances by some of her children.

'I believe that normalizing stories around stigmatizing matters will make them more palatable for audiences to embrace,' the thespian said in a statement about her first-look deal.

'Art can change perception and I plan to develop projects that can help further the conversation. I also aim to help cultivate and establish new young talent and their stories because they are our future and deserve a voice and a platform to be heard.'
