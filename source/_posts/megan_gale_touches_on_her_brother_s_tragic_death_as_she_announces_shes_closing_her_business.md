Megan Gale has announced she is closing down her children's skincare business, The Mindful Life.

The 45-year-old model shared an emotional video to Instagram on Monday in which she revealed that her brother Jason's tragic death in July had made her 'reassess' her life and priorities.

'There's nothing like the death of someone extremely close to you to make you stop and take stock and make you reassess what you're doing with your own life and underline the complete importance of how precious life is,' Megan said. 

'Life is precious': On Monday, a heartbroken Megan Gale touched on her brother Jason's death as she announced she was closing her children's skincare business

Megan said she was devastated to be closing her business selling natural skincare products for children, but she knew it was the right thing to do.

She said she 'fought' hard to keep her business going after being let down by third parties, but admitted it had become 'soul destroying'.

'For me it's been particularly challenging doing a business myself... In short, I trusted the wrong people and with some pretty major elements of the business. What I lost was the most valuable commodity - time,' she said.

She explained that she'd tried to save the business by asking advisers for help, but then found out her brother had died, which completely changed her perspective. 

'Nothing else mattered except family, that's when I pressed pause, went to Perth and in quarantine,' Megan said.

'That's when I had a lot of time. There's nothing like the death of someone extremely close to you to make you stop and take stock and make you reassess what you're doing with your own life.'

Following Jason's death, she came to realise 'the complete importance of how precious life is and how little time we really do have here and how we don't know how long we have here'.

She added: 'As I sat in quarantine, I realised I don't have to keep fighting to rebuild this business, what I should be fighting for is rebuilding myself... Ultimately, day to day, it was becoming less and less harmonious for me.'

After winding down her business, Megan now gets to spend more time with her children, River, six, and Rosie, two, and her fiancé, retired AFL star Shaun Hampson.

She added that 'The Mindful Life 2.0' could always come back in future.

Earlier this month, Megan broke her silence on her brother Jason's death, which occurred in July.

With tough border restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Melbourne-based model revealed on Instagram that she knew she 'would regret not going' to his funeral in Perth.

Jason Gale, 49, was last seen at a petrol station on July 14 in Western Australia, and was found dead a week later in bushland next to his 1999 Honda CR-V SUV.

Megan flew from Melbourne to Perth, where she completed two weeks of hotel quarantine, and travelled to Fremantle Cemetery for his cremation service.

In her video, Megan said she'd 'weighed up' whether to stay in Melbourne and seek the comfort of her immediate family, or fly to Perth and play her part in sending her brother off.

'I had to weigh that up. Part of me wanted to stay in Melbourne and be with my kids and my man at that time when I needed comfort more than any other time in my life,' she said.

'But I also wanted to be in Perth to support my mum, my brother and the rest of my family, and play a part in sending my brother off and putting him to rest.'

Megan also revealed her concerns about her attendance drawing 'more media attention' to her brother's death. 

Tragic: Jason Gale, 49, was last seen at a petrol station on July 14 in Western Australia, and was found dead a week later in bushland next to his 1999 Honda CR-V SUV

Jason was last seen on July 14 buying petrol and water at the Popanyinning General Store, 160km south-east from his Perth home.

Following a desperate week-long search by family, friends and police, he was found dead next to his car. The death was not considered suspicious.

Jason, an industrial mechanic, was known for 'going bush' but his friend Belinda Murray said he had never disappeared before.

Ms Murray said Jason 'really struggled' after watching a man die in a tragic 2018 incident at a wastewater plant south of Perth.

Daily Mail Australia understands Jason was one of a group of colleagues who were there with the victim when he was struck and killed by a pipe.
