The Block Australia was forced to suspend filming in March due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

And now it has been revealed that production was thrown into chaos after a contestant displayed symptoms of the deadly respiratory illness.

An on-set insider told New Idea magazine that the show's producers were forced to confine one of the contestants to their room after they reported having 'a sore throat and general signs of unwellness.'

Tools down! On Monday, a report in New Idea magazine suggested that production of The Block has been  thrown into chaos after an unnamed contestant of the hit renovation show displayed symptoms of coronavirus (Pictured is father/daughter duo Harry and Tash from the current season) 

They also added the crew was shocked at seeing the person who lives a 'very healthy lifestyle' become ill 'so quickly'.

Filming of The Block was halted for five weeks in March and resumed in early May.

A spokesperson from Channel Nine confirmed the incident to Daily Mail Australia on Monday, explaining a contestant had been unwell in March. 

'During filming a contestant woke with a mild sore throat. As a precaution they isolated in their room and monitored their symptoms,' they said.

'In March with only one symptom and not being a close contact to a confirmed case, they did not qualify for a coronavirus test,' they added. 

'Their mild symptoms went away shortly after first presenting. After some rest the contest resumed their daily duties.'

Precautions: Filming of The Block was halted for five weeks in March and resumed in early May. At the time that filming resumed, foreman Keith Schleiger told A Current Affair that several precautions had been put in place to ensure the safety of the cast and crew (Pictured is host Scott Cam having his temperature taken on set) 

This season is being filmed in Brighton, Melbourne.

At the time that filming resumed, foreman Keith Schleiger told A Current Affair that several precautions had been put in place to ensure the safety of the cast and crew.

'We are policing the 1.5-metre rule. It's very important on The Block that we have sufficient room between each person,' he said.

Shut down! The Block is not the first program shot in Melbourne to have a brush with the disease after The Masked Singer was forced to shut down earlier this month after seven dancers test positive for COVID-19 (Pictured is the Wizard, host Osher Günsberg and the Cactus from the current season of The Masked Singer) 

On-site safety measures include limiting how many people can gather in rooms and hallways, disinfecting surfaces, regular temperature checks, and making sure all the cast and crew have had the flu vaccine.

Producers have also increased the availability of hand sanitiser and face masks.

Twist: Meanwhile, on this year's season of The Block, contestants were given homes ranging from the 1910s to 1950s and briefed to restore them to their former glory (Pictured host Shelley Craft dressed as Sandy from Grease in a promo) 

Meanwhile, in a twist on this year's season of The Block, contestants were given homes ranging from the 1910s to 1950s and briefed to restore them to their former glory.

However, the judges have been left underwhelmed with the rooms being produced on the show 'looking bland and generic' and not in keeping with the spirit of the briefing.

During Sunday night's episode, judge Shaynna Blaze voiced her disappointment upon discovering that Sarah and George had gone with 'curved skirting' and not kept with the 'sharp lines' in other rooms.

'Everything in the rest of this house is sharp lines. They have decided to create their own version of the 1940s and not look at the beauty in that hallway. I'm actually now getting upset,' she said.

Jimmy and Tam's 1950's guest bedroom ended up being the winning room.

Jimmy and Tam not only scored the highest with 25-and-a-half points but were also awarded the $10,000 cash prize and state-of-the-art appliances for their kitchen.

The Block continues Monday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine.
