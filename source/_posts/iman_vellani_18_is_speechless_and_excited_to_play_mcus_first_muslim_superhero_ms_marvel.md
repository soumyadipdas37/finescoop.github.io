Created in 2014, Kamala develops 'Inhuman' genes in the aftermatch of the 'Inhumanity' storyline and assumes the mantle of Ms. Marvel from her idol Carol Danvers after Danvers becomes Captain Marvel.

Hugo Award-winning writer G. Willow Wilson - who penned the relaunched Ms. Marvel comics - tweeted of Vellani: 'She is the real deal.'

The president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, reportedly plans on using Iman in both the series and future Marvel films which might mean fans get to see Oscar winner Brie Larson play Captain Marvel in her show.
