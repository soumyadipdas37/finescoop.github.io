Fans returned to a competitive league match for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic on Saturday as Carlisle United fans were allowed to attend their League Two match against Southend United. 

Earlier this week, the English Football League (EFL) picked nine matches over the course of the weekend to allow 1,000 fans in as part of the UK's 'return of fans' pilot programme, including Norwich City and Middlesbrough in the Championship.

While Luton Town, who play Derby County on Saturday, pulled out of the initiative due to a lack of preparation time, Carlisle fans were able to watch their team live for the first time since the global pandemic halted the 2019-20 campaign in March. 

1,000 fans were allowed to attend Carlisle vs Southend United on Saturday afternoon 

The development is part of the 'return to fans' pilot programme following the COVID-19 crisis

Areas were marked out where fans could sit at Brunton Park while face coverings had to be worn while entering the ground, but not in the stadium seats or in the terraces. 

Stewards also monitored where fans were placed as both the seated and terraced areas at Carlisle were open to supporters. 

And the Cumbrians were given a treat by their team as two goals in three minutes from Omari Patrick and Joshua Kayode gave Carlisle a strong first-half lead. 

The nine EFL clubs were chosen as they were able to provide ways they could implement social distancing at the grounds.

Carlisle hosted supporters for the early kick-off with eight more EFL matches welcoming fans

EFL chairman Rick Parry said: 'It's encouraging that we are in a position to move forward with the next phase of the pilot programme and give a small number of our clubs the opportunity to welcome back up to a 1,000 fans this week.

'The health and well-being of supporters and their wider communities remains the priority, but social distancing can be applied safely. 

'By extending across more EFL clubs we hope to further demonstrate that the measures developed can allow fans to return in greater numbers from as early as next month.' 

The UK Government are currently intending to allow more fans to attend matches across the entire English football pyramid from October 1.

The number of permitted fans could rise to 2,500 as clubs are set to receive a financial boost after months of empty seats and unused turnstiles. 

There are currently no plans to run test events in Premier League matches as England's top-flight enters its second weekend of the 2020-21 season. 

However, there are fears that this development could be delayed until November after Boris Johnson's 'rule of six' limitation that was implemented this week.

The Prime Minister ruled that social gatherings of more than six people are banned following a rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.  

Two first-half goals meant it was a happy return to the stadium for the Cumbrians on Saturday
