Dominic Raab's bodyguard sparked a police scramble at Heathrow airport after leaving his loaded, semi-automatic Glock 19 pistol on the seat of a plane.

The alarm was raised by a cleaner after she found the unattended weapon in its holster on board the United Airlines jet from Washington DC before officers descended on the scene. 

But they were eventually stood down after realising the gun belonged to a protection officer assigned to the Foreign Secretary who had been in the US to discuss the issues of Brexit and Northern Ireland with political leaders.

The Metropolitan Police have since confirmed that the security officer has been suspended from operational firearms duties pending an investigation.

The United Airlines flight landed at Heathrow's Terminal 2 shortly before 6.30am earlier today.  

'The protection officer began sorting out passports and preparing to escort Mr Raab off the flight,' a source told The Sun.

'For whatever reason, he took off his holster with the loaded Glock pistol inside and laid it on the seat.

'The officer then went off with the Foreign Secretary, leaving the gun behind. The cleaners came on and one of them found the gun in its holster.

'She was understandably shocked and called for help and police were called.'

MailOnline has contacted the Foreign Office for comment.

Earlier this year, one of David Cameron's bodyguards left his Glock pistol in a toilet while on a British Airways flight from New York to London.
