Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has returned to Portsmouth from exercises after seven of its crew tested positive for Covid-19.

The 65,000-tonne, £3.1 billion vessel had been set to leave the city on Monday, but her sailing was pushed back after the outbreak.

Around 100 further members of crew were isolating onboard because they had been in contact with positive cases. 

On Sunday, crowds gathered to watch the impressive carrier as it returned to the naval city.

It was picking up supplies ahead of sailing for further exercises to prepare it for Carrier Strike Group readiness ahead of its first operational deployment next year. 

It was the second time the carrier has had to postpone its sailing after two crew members tested positive for Covid-19 in April.
