The TV series The Durrells – starring Keeley Hawes as Louisa Durrell – was one of ITV’s biggest hits in recent years, telling the story of the writer Gerald Durrell’s family and their four years in Greece.

One of the biggest stars of the show is the island of Corfu. With its sparkling cobalt-blue sea and beautiful mountainous interior, it is easy to see why the famous naturalist and author instantly fell in love with the sun-drenched Greek isle when his family moved there in 1935.

Now you can put yourselves in the shoes of the author – and the show’s cast – on our exclusive Corfu trip with the naturalist, author and broadcaster Lee Durrell. 

Durrells’ delights: Corfu Town on the delightful island of Corfu, with its sparkling cobalt-blue sea and beautiful mountainous interior

During this magical holiday, you will visit memorable filming locations from the TV series and many of the places that Lee’s late husband Gerald immortalised in his wonderful memoir My Family And Other Animals.

Enjoy expertly guided excursions to some of the young Gerry’s haunts – including Mouse Island and the Lake of Lilies – and visit the charming home of his literary elder brother, Lawrence. 

You’ll enjoy a lunch at the renowned Taverna Foros (which has been featured by TV chef Rick Stein), plus you will take a boat trip to Corfu’s intriguing neighbour Albania.

Pontikonisi – or Mouse Island - which is one of the Durrells’ favourite places

Lee Durrell, the naturalist, broadcaster and writer 

Naturalist, broadcaster and writer Lee Durrell is the honorary director of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, which aims to save endangered species from extinction. 

The author of three books, including A Practical Guide For The Amateur Naturalist, Lee co-presented several TV series with Gerald and advised on The Durrells – an adaptation of her husband’s trilogy of books about his childhood, including My Family And Other Animals. 

Your special guest will be Lee Durrell, who will share family stories as she introduces you to the Durrells’ favourite spots. Lee says: ‘The magic of Gerald Durrell’s childhood can still be experienced. 

'It will be a privilege to watch as the sun, sea and flower-filled olive groves that so beguiled the young Gerry once again weave their spell.’

REASONS TO BOOK

Meet Lee Durrell: The naturalist will give her personal insights into the life of her late husband and their work together. As well as retracing the young Gerry’s footsteps, Lee will give two exclusive talks reflecting on his lifelong love of Corfu and his legacy.

Visit the Durrells’ favourite places: Anyone who enjoyed reading My Family And Other Animals as a child will have dreamt of spending an afternoon on Pontikonisi, or Mouse Island. Gerald and his sister Margo – played by Milo Parker and Daisy Waterstone in the ITV drama – spent many happy hours on this tiny islet, which is a short scenic boat ride from Corfu Town. 

Another highlight will be a trip to Kalami Bay accompanied by Lee. Poet and author Lawrence Durrell lived here with his wife Nancy in the White House, an elegant villa on a beach where the couple loved to swim.

You will also see the location of the original Strawberry Pink Villa where Gerald Durrell’s family lived and their picnicking spot, Lake Antiniotissa, called the Lake of Lilies by Gerald after the dainty sand lilies there.

Your four-star hotel: You will be staying at the stylish Divani Corfu Palace, with superb sea views, sitting on a peninsula overlooking a lagoon. Your guided walking tour of Corfu Town’s cobbled streets will take in elegant Spianada Square and the iconic 16th Century St Spyridon Church. 

Another must is the Achilleion Palace and museum, a 100-year-old villa filled with statues and other mementoes of its former royal owners: Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.

A taste of Albania: Only a sliver of sea separates Corfu from the Albanian coast, where you will enjoy a private guided tour of archaeological site Butrint – the atmospheric ruins of an ancient Greek and Roman city.
