He has been busy paving his new life as a single father after splitting from wife of 10-years Megan Fox, 34, in May.

And Brian Austin Green was spotted knocking some things off his to-do list at Malibu Country Mart in Malibu on Wednesday afternoon. 

The 47-year-old 90210 alum put his arm tattoos on display in a marled grey tee by weekend wear brand Sol Angeles.

He also had on a pair of cozy drawstring joggers and his favorite checkered Vans sneakers.

Green carried all of his essentials in a black backpack with purple detailing and he kept a camo print face covering around his neck.

His hair looked noticeably undone and he wore a pair of black sunglasses over his eyes as he made his way through the parking lot. 

After taking care of his errands, Brian treated his three sons, Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four, to a 'Beach Day' in Malibu.

The Desperate Housewives star uploaded a shirtless self-portrait to his Instagram page that gave his 471,000 followers a view of the beach and his sons playing in the water.

The boys looked to be having a blast as Brian soaked up the sun in the sand.

Green shares his three sons with ex wife Megan Fox, whom he originally married in 2010.   

Back in May, Green confirmed his split from Fox during an episode of his podcast ...With Brian Austin Green. During his confession, he maintained that infidelity did not play a role in their separation and that he will alway have love for Megan.

'I will always love her. And I know she will always love me and I know as far as a family what we have built is really cool and really special.'

Shortly after going public with their split, Megan began enjoying some rather cozy hangouts with rapper and new beau Machine Gun Kelly, 30.

Megan and Machine Gun Kelly, born Colson Baker, first met on the set of their upcoming thriller film Midnight In The Switchgrass and reportedly had an instant connection. 

The film, which was forced to halt production in March due to COVID-19, resumed filming in July in Puerto Rico.

But, according to TMZ, the Randall Emmett directed film recently had its production schedule thwarted after two people on set tested positive for the corona virus.

Emmett is reportedly planning on resuming filming in Santa Barbara sometime in the next few weeks, the outlet revealed.

Green also has a son Kassius, 18, that he shared with ex-fiancee Vanessa Marcil. 

And Marcil recently voiced her support for Megan as she recalled the 'complete devastation' Green put her through in their ongoing 13-year court battle.

In a series of posts shared to her Instagram Story, the 51-year-old wrote that she 'actually has respect' for Fox for 'living her life for herself' and moving on with Kelly. 

She added: 'Megan finally living her life for herself is in itself a gift to her children.'

Since splitting from Megan in May, Brian has attempted to explore his own romantic options by heading out on dates with the likes of former 'child bride' Courtney Stodden and Australian model Tina Louise.
