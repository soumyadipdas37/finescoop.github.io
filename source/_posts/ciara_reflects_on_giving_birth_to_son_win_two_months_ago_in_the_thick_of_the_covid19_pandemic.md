Ciara welcomed her son Win Harrison two months ago when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing.

And this week the 34-year-old singer told Tamron Hall on The Motherhood Juggle, that she focused on 'the positive moments' during her pregnancy. 

'I think my biggest mission or focal point was to try my best to always find the silver lining through it all,' she told Hall.

She added: 'I think you have to take a step back and think about, the reality is it's a blessing and a gift to be able to give birth, so if you think about that, that kind of supersedes everything.' 

The performer, who also shares her three-year-old daughter Sienna with husband Russell Wilson and son Future, six, with ex Future, also navigated her pregnancy by attempting to learn how the pandemic could affect her children.

'I was always looking for articles that would talk about infants when they're born, and there wasn't a lot of articles about that,' she noted, before saying she will be 'one of those moms that are in the experimental phase of it all, too, to see what happens.'

After becoming a mom-of-three, Ciara described raising multiple young children as a 'balancing act.'

'I will say, there's a saying it takes a village,' Ciara said, while urging other parents to enlist help, 'whether it's your mom, whether it's your sister.' 

She continued: 'I encourage people to also have that person help, if possible.'

'I will say, there's a saying it takes a village,' Ciara said, while urging other parents to enlist help from family 

'I had a nurse helping me with Future when he was younger and I did not let her do anything,' she recalled, after her eldest was born. 'But help is okay.' 

She and Wilson first announced their pregnancy in January, just a few months ahead of lockdown. 

Speaking to People after giving birth Ciara previously shared, 'It's been a blessing being able to be with my family more than normal. We have faith that we're going to figure it all out' despite the crazy times.'
