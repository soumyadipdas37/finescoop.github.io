Andros Townsend revealed that he was confident that Crystal Palace could catch Manchester United cold at Old Trafford.

United had a delayed start to the new campaign following their involvement in Europe at the end of last season and they were far from at their best on Saturday, with Palace securing a 3-1 victory.

Townsend found the net in the seventh minute to put Palace ahead, with Wilfried Zaha scoring a brace, which ensured a frustrating time for United, despite debutant Donny van de Beek's goal.

It has been a superb start to the Premier League campaign for Palace, with this victory following on from their success against Southampton last weekend. 

Asked whether he is surprised by Palace's start to the season, Townsend told Sky Sports: 'No we know we have a good enough squad. We added one or two young players and are fully confident. 

Townsend played a significant part as Palace continued their encouraging start to the season

'With United having their first game here we thought we could catch them cold. Once we get ahead we're a well drilled team and knew we had enough to stay in front. Mentally we knew we had an advantage. 

'We knew if we started fast we might catch them cold and then it was a point of seeing out the game plan.'

It was a particularly special occasion for Zaha, who endured a hugely frustrating spell at United between 2013 and 2015.

Townsend was full of praise for team-mate Wilfried Zaha, describing his display as 'incredible'

Townsend was full of praise for what he described as an 'incredible' performance from Zaha. 

Townsend said: 'Wilf Zaha was incredible. He's shown that in the last six or seven years. It was a real captain's performance and hope he can carry that on for a while yet.'

Next up for Palace is a home game against Everton, who have also started the season very well.
