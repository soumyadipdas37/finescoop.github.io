A homeless man has been left devastated after all of his possessions were thrown in a bin by council workers.

Dave Randall has been sleeping rough under a bridge near Chevron Island, an affluent suburb in the Gold Coast. 

About three weeks ago the struggling resident returned to the spot find all of his belongings, including blankets and spare clothes, had been tossed out. 

His friend Anthony Grech took to Facebook to call out the City of Gold Coast council for discarding Mr Randall's items.

'They've come here and picked all his stuff up, everything he owns and they've thrown it away into the bin, just like that,' Mr Grech said in the video.

'I think that's disgusting.

'The council knew he was sleeping here – everyone knew he was under here. We've been trying to get him off the streets and get him a place.

'The council can't be just throwing, like, all his belongings away in the bin. It's not right…it really upsets me.'

Mr Randall, who has been homeless for five years, has spent the past few weeks trying to source new blankets and clothes.  

Mr Grech has spent the past 18 months trying to help Mr Randall turn his life around.

He said throwing out his items was making it more difficult.

He said rangers were moving the homeless on to other areas rather than helping them.

'There's a lot more we can do to actually help these people get off the streets.' 

A council spokeswoman told the Gold Coast Bulletin cleaners removed the items, which were left unattended in a public area, as they thought they had been discarded. 

'We are working closely with the Queensland Government, through the Department of Housing and Public Works (DHPW) and as well as local specialist homelessness services in relation to this individual’s situation,' she said.

'The causes and impacts of homelessness are complex and require a co-ordinated response by a range of relevant government departments, community organisations and local businesses.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the City of Gold Coast council for further comment.
