Gary Neville has fumed after Crystal Palace were awarded a penalty for handball, which was then re-taken after David De Gea was seen to be off his line.

The incident happened in the second-half as Crystal Palace were 1-0 up as Jordan Ayew kicked the ball off the arm of Victor Lindelof.

The incident was investigated by VAR who decided to award the penalty.

Referee Martin Atkinson gave a penalty for a handball on Victor Lindelof after a VAR review

Gary Neville criticed the decision saying the defender could not have done anything 

Jordan Ayew's tame penalty was saved but David De Gea was deemed to have been off his line

Former United player Gary Neville was amazed at the decision to investigate the a possible handball and to award the penalty.

He said:  'Ayew scoops it up against Lindelof's arm - I'll be absolutely amazed, I'd be devastated if I had a penalty given against me for that.

'His arm's moved with his running action. I thought that Leeds one last week at Anfield was nonsense and I think this one is equally so. 

'Absolutely no chance is that a penalty, never in a million years. Not a chance he's not got a clue that has happened so quick running back defending one-on-one. In the swing of the game Crystal Palace deserve to be 2-0 but the way it's happening is the problem. Roy Hodgson would think it's nonsense at all.'

Jordan Ayew stepped up to take the penalty but his weak shot was comfortably saved by De Gea.

Though half a minute after the penalty was missed, the referee stopped play to re-award the penalty after De Gea was inches off his line.  

Wilfried Zaha stepped up on the second effort and converted to then put Palace 2-0 in front

Gary Neville called the penalty decision 'nonsense' and the decision to retake it a 'disgrace'

Neville said: 'That's an absolute disgrace he was what two inches off the line. We're talking millimetres that is unbelievable. I understand if they gain a yard or two yards.'

'Crystal Palace have been far better and Manchester United have been nowhere near their sharpness. But their has been a element of good luck, the penalty was not a penalty and the re-take was nonsense, but Man United have been well short.

Wilfried Zaha stepped up instead of Ayew and smashed the ball home to make it 2-0.

Donny van de Beek got his first goal for the club to make it 2-1 before Zaha added a third.
