She was due to co-host E!'s Live From The Red Carpet Emmys pre-show on Sunday.

But instead, Vivica A. Fox had to withdraw from her hosting duties after testing positive for COVID-19.

Replacement host Brad Goreski read out a statement from the 56-year-old actress, in which she explained: 'Unfortunately, I have tested positive for the coronavirus. So, in an abundance of caution I am isolating myself at home.'

'During these unprecedented times, it's more important than ever that we follow all safety and health rules and guidelines to protect ourselves and each other,' Fox added  

Fox's scheduled co-host Giuliani Rancic also announced she'd be watching from home after also testing positive for COVID-19.

She shared that her husband Bill Rancic and their son also had the virus but are 'doing well.'

In a video shown during the E! pre-show, Rancic said: 'As part of E! and NBCUniversal's very strict testing guidelines especially before an event like this, I did find out I tested positive for COVID-19. Now as much as I didn't want to hear that, I'm very thankful that I heard it before I traveled and possibly could've exposed other people.'

This year's Emmys honoring the best in television promise to be radically different as producers scrambled to create Hollywood's first major pandemic-era awards show.

The coronavirus has turned Tinseltown upside down, bringing productions to a halt even as stay-at-home orders around the world send binge-watching through the roof.

Late night funnyman Jimmy Kimmel hosts the 72nd Emmys live on Sunday from an empty theater in Los Angeles with winners beaming in from the safety of their homes due to Covid-19.

Adding to the unpredictability on a night of firsts, 130-odd nominees who were sent cameras to hook up in their own living rooms have been encouraged to get creative with their speeches.

There will be no red carpet and no star-studded audience. A-listers are invited to trade gowns and tuxedos for pajamas.

Dutch courage: ABC's late night host Jimmy Kimmel serves as emcee of the Emmys that promise to be radically different from any other major awards show in Hollywood history

'Ratings have been flagging for award shows for years... This is, if nothing else, an opportunity to mix things up, to do an award ceremony in a way unlike any other that's been done,' said IndieWire TV awards editor Libby Hill.

'Even if Sunday night is a complete disaster, it's at least going to be an interesting disaster. And that's really all you ask for in 2020.'

Capturing this year's somewhat anarchic zeitgeist, Watchmen leads the charge with a whopping 26 nominations, primarily in the limited series categories.

The eerily prescient comic book adaptation that debuted last October confronts historic US racism, police violence and even mask-wearing. It also wowed critics and audiences alike.

Watchmen speaks so specifically in so many unprecedented ways to the moment in which we're living right now,' said Hill.

'I think people will probably get pretty tired of hearing Watchmen's name getting called... it's as much of a lock as we have right now.'

With HBO's record-breaking Emmys juggernaut Game of Thrones having finally mounted a dragon and soared off to Westeros, the awards in the drama series categories promise to be more fiercely contested this year.

'It's a relief for HBO that they have Succession hitting at the right time,' said Deadline awards columnist Pete Hammond.

The critically adored show about a powerful family's back-stabbing battle for control of a dynastic media empire won a writing Emmy in its first season, and has amassed 18 nominations this time.

But it is tied with Ozark, a dark money-laundering tale set in the American heartland from Netflix, which despite landing a record 160 nominations this year is still desperate to win its first major series Emmy.

Lurking in the background are British royals saga The Crown and Star Wars tale The Mandalorian, which boasts lavish Thrones-esque production values and has already scooped five Emmys in technical categories this week for newcomer Disney+.

Comedy this year appears to be a toss-up between previous serial winner The Marvelous Mrs Maisel- Amazon's quirky tale of a 1950s housewife who becomes a standup comic - and Schitt's Creek.

The latter, a Canadian comedy about a privileged family forced to live in a rundown motel, failed to earn a single nomination in its first four years, but became a sleeper hit after airing on Netflix and signed off with a heartwarming final season.

Aside from the awards themselves, the night will honor the career achievement of Tyler Perry.

The African-American entertainment mogul has championed greater diversity in Hollywood, and this year paid funeral costs for black victims of police violence including George Floyd.
