Britney Spears recently endorsed the #FreeBritney movement, a fan-generated effort to loosen the reigns on the pop star's 12-year conservatorship.

And Spears, 38, continued to pave her path to personal autonomy on Thursday when she took to Instagram to speak candidly about the toxic beauty standards in Hollywood. 

'For the first time in my life I'm going without lots and lots of makeup !!!!!! These clips show a closer look at my face …. which is very scary for me ... you can actually see my freckles !!!!' began the Pretty Girls singer in her post's caption.

Spears, who first entered the spotlight at just 10-years-old, admitted that 'growing up in Hollywood can be hard' because the industry is 'all about looks.'

'And the press can be pretty mean ….. “why does she look so old” ... “why does she look so young” ... “why is she too big” ... “why is she too skinny” ?!?!!!!,' Britney listed.  

'As Selena Gomez says ….. the world can be a nasty place ... kill them with kindness ... GOD BLESS YOU ALL ❤️❤️❤️ !!!! And with all that love right back to ya !!!! Ps …. just another touch of ROSE,' concluded the songstress.

Gomez took to Spears' comment section to voice her admiration for the star and to marvel at her natural beauty.

'You’ve always been beautiful and a huge inspiration to me ✨You’re rare beauty!!!,' wrote the 28-year-old Wizards Of Waverly Place star, who recently launched her own beauty line Rare Beauty at Sephora.

In the montage of clips, Britney stood before her camera as she messed with her hair and tilted her head.

Her lengthy golden tresses were styled into her go-to half up, half down hairdo and her bangs softly framed her face. 

The Lucky songstress drew attention to her hypnotic brown eyes by lightly lining them with a bit of dark brown liner.

Like she mentioned in her caption, Britney's freckles were on fully display and she appeared to be rocking a natural flush. 

Spears had on a floral off-the-shoulder crop top and she had a chain choker with a stone pendant fastened around her neck.

Two hours later, the If U Seek Amy singer changed out of her floral top and reappeared on Instagram in a white peasant blouse and her go-to khaki shorts.

'Just shot this one today !!! No, this is not apart of the rose project .... but yes I had another great hair day!!!!' wrote the star, who also showed off sparkling belly button ring.

Spears' attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her conservatorship case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', reported TMZ on Thursday.  

'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father [Jamie Spears, 68] to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote. 

According to the outlet, Britney said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye. Britney shares sons Sean Preston, 14 and Jayden James, 13 with ex Kevin Federline.

The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans.

Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Womanizer crooner to be released from her conservatorship.

'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf.

Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception,has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate.

That line seemed to be in direct response to an interview that Britney's dad gave last month in an effort to curtail the movement.

'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told PageSix.

Adding: 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'
