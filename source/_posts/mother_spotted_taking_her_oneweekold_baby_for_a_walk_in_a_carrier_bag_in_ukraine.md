A mother who put her newborn baby into a bag and took him for a walk has been fined by police in Ukraine.

The unnamed woman, 29, was spotted by shocked passers-by in the capital city of Kiev on Wednesday.

She was walking along the street and 'singing a lullaby to her bag', passers-by said.

An unnamed woman who put her newborn baby into a bag and took him for a walk (left and right) has been fined by police in Ukraine.

A witness said to local media: 'The woman behaved weird and I started watching her. Then I heard a baby crying. The next moment, I realised the cry was coming from her bag.

'I approached her and asked if I could look in the bag. She said "no" and hurried away. I reported the woman to the police.'

The video filmed by an onlooker shows officers stopping the mother then pulling the baby out of her bag.

The mother can be heard saying to cops: 'Leave him [the baby] alone. He is alive. He is fine.'

However, some witnesses whose voices are heard in the background expressed concerns about the child's well-being.

One woman said: 'He could suffocate in the bag.'

While another woman commented: 'The child is wrapped in a winter jacket. He is all wet.'

According to reports, the temperature was 30С (86 F) at the time of the incident.

The officers reportedly put the baby in the back seat of their car and called an ambulance.

The child was taken to hospital and is now under constant medical care, according to local media.

Police officer Maksim Kravchuk said: 'We looked into the woman's bag and saw the newborn inside.

'We put the child into our car while we were waiting for an ambulance.

'The mother behaved aggressively toward us.'

Explaining her actions to the police officers, the mother said 'she put the baby into her bag because she did not have a pram'.

The woman, who has six children, also said 'she recently came to Kyiv from the city of Odessa hoping to find a job'.

She faces a fine for not fulfilling parental duties, police said.
