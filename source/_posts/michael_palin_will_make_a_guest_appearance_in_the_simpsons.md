Michael Palin has revealed he is set to make a guest appearance in The Simpsons. 

The Monty Python icon, 77, announced the exciting casting news during The One Show on Tuesday, where he also reflected on his career as a whole.

When asked if rumours were true that he was set to join the Simpsons family in Springfield, he said: 'Yes, I've recorded my contribution. I play a museum curator, he's a wacky character.'

In July, producer and writer Matt Selman revealed at the virtural San Diego Comic Con that Michael would be part of the show.

He gushed: Sir Michael Palin from Monty Python will be appearing on The Simpsons. Which is pretty exciting for me.

'I love them all, sorry everyone else, I think he’s my favourite.'

Michael joins a long line of famous faces to make a guest appearance on the iconic cartoon series, as stars like Gordon Ramsay, Paul McCartney, Danny DeVito, and Mark Hamill has also taken part.

The iconic series has won 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award.

Since ending his Monty Python days, Michael has gone on to carve an illustrious career for himself in travelogues, with a new series set to begin on BBC 2 on Sunday.

Of his time travelling, he said of eating an array of foreign food: 'Well I believe you have to eat the food your offered, there's no point taking your local supermarket food with you, because it's a way of creating a bridge with people, is accepting hospitality, but when I had some camel liver in Algeria, it was a bit old. 

It was old before I ate it, it was about two years after its sell-by date. I was extremely ill all day and yet we had to go out and we had to interview a guerrilla leader out in the middle of the desert, so I would ask him a couple of questions, go outside, throw up, come back in again, and say Ermm, so…'
