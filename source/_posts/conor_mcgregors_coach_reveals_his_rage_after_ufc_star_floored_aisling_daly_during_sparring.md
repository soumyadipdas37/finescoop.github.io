UFC superstar Conor McGregor and coach John Kavanagh have formed one of the most formidable partnerships in the sport's history.

But years before McGregor started winning titles, he was humbled by his coach during one of their very first training sessions.

Speaking to the Irish Independent, Kavanagh relayed his rage when McGregor dropped now-retired Irish women's strawweight Aisling Daly during a sparring session back in 2007.

Kavanagh said: 'It sounds worse than it was. He wasn't hitting her in the head or anything, but just happened to throw a body shot that hit her in the sweet spot, the solar plexus, and put her down.

'I got a little emotional because Ais had been with me a long time and the other guys would look after her.

'But this new guy had come in and put her down, and my protective nature kicked in.

'I was still fighting at that stage, or hadn't stopped that long, so I put the gloves on - actually, he has corrected me on that and says it was bare knuckles.

'But I held him down and beat the s**t out of him, without putting too fine a point on it.

'I kept hitting him in the body until he couldn't breathe and then I looked at him: 'What's it going to be? We can train or we can fight?' And he was OK from the next day.'

The pair have since gone on to become one of the most successful fighter-coach partnerships in mixed-martial arts.

McGregor returned to the Octagon in January, easily beating Donald Cerrone via TKO as he returned to winning ways following a defeat to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018.

The Irishman retired from the sport back in June, though he has retired twice before, leading many to believe his decision would not be permanent.

Dana White has confirmed McGregor won't fight in 2020, though McGregor has hinted that he may be ready for a comeback against rival Nate Diaz.
