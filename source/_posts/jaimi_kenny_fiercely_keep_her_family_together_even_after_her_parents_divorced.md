Lisa Curry and her ex-husband Grant Kenny put on a united front as they bid farewell to their eldest daughter Jaimi at her funeral on Saturday, following her tragic death aged 33. 

And new reports claim Jaimi was largely to thank for keeping her tight-knit family together, even until the end.  

'She was so fiercely protective of her parents and sister and brother,' a friend told Woman's Day magazine of Jamie, who died last Monday after battling an eating disorder and alcoholism for years.

'She believed in family first and even after her parents split, she loved everyone coming together for Christmas and special family occasions - she was a one-in-a million, with a smile like sunshine that will now light up the heavens,' they added. 

Jaimi is survived by her younger siblings, brother Jett Kenny and sister Morgan Gruell.  

Following the separation of her parents in 2009, Jaimi made great efforts to maintain a strong relationship with Grant's new partner Fifi Box and their first daughter Trixie.

Grant dated radio star Fifi for several months in 2012, but had broken up by the time she welcomed daughter Beatrix 'Trixie' Belle via IVF the following year. 

Fifi did not acknowledge Grant was Trixie's father until 2016, when she shared a photo to Instagram of the retired athlete attending their child's third birthday party. 

Despite the unusual circumstances, Jaimi kept a close friendship with Fifi, and would even babysit her much younger half-sister Trixie on occasion while single mum Fifi was at work.

Prior to her death, Jaimi had expressed her desire to one day have a family of her own, and absolutely doted on the children in her family. 

'Jaimi absolutely adored children and was especially close to Trixie,' a family friend told Sunshine Coast Daily. The children gave her 'a whole new lease on life'. 

Jaimi was also fiercely protective of her mother in the face of criticism.

In 2014, Jaimi blasted false and hurtful reports that Lisa was planning to have children out of 'revenge' because her ex-husband had just become a father again.

At the time, Lisa was dating a man two decades her junior, Joel Walkenhorst, and there were rumours the couple wanted to have children.

Much of the commentary on social media was negative, and it was suggested by some that Lisa's desire to have a baby at 51 was about 'getting back' at ex-husband Grant, after he welcomed Trixie with Fifi Box in 2013.  

As reported by New Idea, Jaimi stepped up to defend her mother at the time.

She wrote on Instagram: 'Mum wanting a child had nothing to do with Fifi... Mum had talked with us about her thoughts on going through IVF before Trixie was conceived.

'You never know the conversations we have had as a family, or the timing of these. It's upsetting to read such nasty things being said about our mother, without people knowing her personally.'  

Jaimi Kenny died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital in Queensland on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father.

Dozens of devastated family and friends gathered for the funeral on the Sunshine Coast on Saturday afternoon, after the tight-knit clan spent almost a week grieving the loss of the 'bright, bubbly' Jaimi. 

Those in attendance congregated out the front of the church, tearfully exchanging hugs before Jaimi's immediate family followed them out of the service. 

Lisa could be seen bursting into tears as her husband Mark Tabone, family members and friends, all tried to comfort her.

 Jett, Morgan and their devastated parents embraced as Jaimi's white coffin, covered in pink and orange dahlias and baby's breath, was placed in the back of the hearse and carried away.

The heart-wrenching final goodbye was made all the more difficult with only 100 family and friends allowed to attend under Queensland coronavirus restrictions.
