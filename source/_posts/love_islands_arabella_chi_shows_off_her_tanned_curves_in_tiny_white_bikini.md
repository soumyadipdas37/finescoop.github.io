She's been making the most of the last few weeks of summer by jetting to Ibiza.

And in between partying and tanning, Love Island beauty Arabella Chi has been working hard, posing for a new sizzling shoot in collaboration with boohooMAN.

In a series of sunset shots shared on her Instagram on Sunday, the reality star wowed in a tiny white bikini.

Arabella, 29, flaunted her golden tan in her barely-there white bikini which she pulled up at the sides to highlight her curves.

She added a nude pleather jacket over the top, while pouting and posing in the evening sunshine. 

'You gave me the look and made me lost in your eyes ✨ @boohoomanofficial' Arabella captioned the snaps.

The media personality been on cloud nine ever since embarking on a new relationship with musician Josh Newsham last month.

Arabella recently moved in with fellow Love Island star Harley Brash, 21, following her split from Wes Nelson.

The pair had been dating for nine months but were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their split.

The hunk left the home he shared with Arabella so they didn't have to isolate together under lockdown rules. He is now living with his friend and former Love Island 2018 co-star, Josh Denzel.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'It's all over. They started to grow apart. They want to remain civil with each other and hope to remain friends.'

The news likely came as a shock to their fans, as just a week before they called it quits, they revealed that they were enjoying their time in lockdown together.

Speaking to OK! Online, Wes said: 'It's been alright. It's hard to get out at the moment, isn't it? We're just trying to do our piece of exercise a day.'

Last week Arabella set tongues-wagging when she packed on the PDA with a new mystery new man in Ibiza.

The star enjoyed a sun-soaked beach day with her new love on Thursday, just weeks after going public with Josh and four months after splitting from Wes.
