She's expecting her first child with her fiancé Reece Hawkins. 

And on Wednesday, London Goheen showed off a glimpse of her baby bump as she posed up in a singlet and a tiny pair of booty shorts. 

The 22-year-old American model shared a mirror selfie on Instagram as she said goodnight to her 524,000 followers.

'Night night y'all,' London captioned the image. 

In the image, which was taken in the bathroom, London wears a blue singlet and shorts, what appeared to be a pyjama set from the brand, Fashion Nova. 

She stuns with her long dark hair out and over her shoulders, while showing off a deep golden tan.

It comes after she was slammed for charging her followers to see photos of her baby bump on OnlyFans.

London, who boasts 524,000 Instagram followers, copped backlash after revealing she was going to be charging fans $14.99 per month on the subscription service. 

OnlyFans is a subscription-based adult website where content can range from something as innocent as a suggestive selfie, all the way to hardcore pornography.

'She's literally charging people for her OnlyFans to view pics of her bump? What the f**k,' one follower commented on London's pregnancy announcement on Instagram.

Another wrote: 'Wow sis is really charging $9.99 per month to see her pregnancy photos lol.'

One fan said that while she's happy for influencer Reece, 25, and London, they just can't comprehend coughing up the cash for the images.

'Congratulations. I would love to keep track of everything for your pregnancy. Just like with your relationship to watch you guys grow together... But I don't want to pay for an OnlyFans...'

However, another follower said that posting to OnlyFans is a good idea, saying it's 'so much safer and more secure!!'

'I have 100 per cent control on my profile': In a statement to Daily Mail Australia earlier this month, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia earlier this month, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans.

'I have chosen to show detailed parts of my pregnancy on that platform because I've had to experience harassment and bullying for the last two years over my relationship with Reece,' she explained.

'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on.

'I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not. If people don't like the idea of it or disagree with my decision then they don't have to be involved...

'We're just doing this to ensure a HAPPY POSITIVE FRUITFUL PREGNANCY.'

Earlier this month, Reece and London announced that they're expecting their first child together, just weeks after getting engaged.

Reece shares two children with ex Tammy Hembrow, son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four.
