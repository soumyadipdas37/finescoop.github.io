A second police officer who was shot whilst on duty in the Compton area of Los Angeles earlier this month has been released from hospital less than two weeks after the brutal and unprovoked shooting.

Claudia Apolinar, 31, was shot multiple times at close range during a drive-by attack which was caught on video on September 12th.

The deputies had been sitting in their patrol car outside a transit center in Compton when a gunman walked up to their vehicle and opened fire. 

Claudia Apolinar, 31, before being released from hospital on Monday is pictured writing out answers to President Trump because she cannot speak. She was shot in the head, as was her 24-year-old partner. LA Sheriff's Department shared these photos over the weekend, obscuring her face

The LA County Sherriffs tweeted the great news that both deputies had been released 

The LA County deputy was discharged just four days after her 24-year-old male partner was released from St. Francis Medical Center.

Both deputies had only joined the department some 14 months ago. 

'Great news,' the LA County Sheriffs Department tweeted.

'Both of our Deputies from the #ComptonAmbush have been discharged from the hospital and are resting. They both have a long road to recover and #LASD appreciates your continued prayers and all the support. #LASDStrong.'  

Apolinar was shot multiple times in the torso and in the head. The sheriff's department said she was grateful to hear from Trump. She was discharged from hospital on Monday

Apolinar, a mother to a six-year-old boy, was shot in the jaw during the shooting but incredibly was able to make a tourniquet for her partner and radio for help.        

Her partner, who was shot in the head during the attack, has not been identified.

In a Facebook post on Saturday, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shared photos of Apolinar  in her hospital bed as one of her co-workers held up the phone to her so that President Trump could wish her a speedy recovery.    

Apolinar with her husband and Sergeant Frederickson (left) and in bed, writing out replies for Frederickson to relay to President Trump because she cannot speak 

She is unable to speak so responded by writing down replies for him to relay to the president.

The post read: 'A week ago today, a callous and heartless criminal attempted to murder two of the heroes that work hard everyday to keep you safe. 

'The outpouring of love and support from our Department, L.A. County Sheriff, the community, and indeed from around the world, has been overwhelming, but also very much appreciated!

'This week #potus45 @realdonaldtrump called both of our deputies to check on their spirits, wish them a speedy recovery and remind them that the #american people are behind them and that the coward that harmed them will be brought to #justice!!

'Here, you can see @lasdtransit Sergeant Frederickson with our #heroine and her husband when the President called her in the ICU. Due to her injuries, Sergeant Frederickson relayed her written responses to #presidenttrump. 

The pair were shot when a gunman (left opening fire and right fleeing the scene) opened fire into a patrol car in Compton  on Saturday night. Both deputies were struck in the head by gunshots, but miraculously they are expected to survive

Along with the male deputy, 31-year-old deputy Claudia Apolinar was injured in the ambush.  Despite taking multiple bullets – one to the face and several to her upper torso – Apolinar managed to get her partner to safety, apply a tourniquet and radio for help

Authorities said that the deputies, who both graduated from the police academy 14 months ago, each sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Apolinar is pictured during her graduation 

'Both of the deputies and their families were very appreciative of the call!'

Trump previously said the shooter should face a 'fast trial death penalty' if either of the deputies died.  

It's unclear what the gunman's motive for attacking the pair was beyond the fact that they are police. The shooter has been described as a black male aged between 28 and 30. 

Police have not yet identified a suspect in the case however a reward that leads to the capture of the person responsible that had initially been set at $100,000 has now risen to $500,000 thanks to contributions from a number of sources. 

The Compton shooting sparked nationwide controversy as bystanders were filmed mocking the bloodied officers at the scene and protesting outside the hospital where they were taken for treatment.

The videos of protesters enraged many critics who said the shooting was the result of anti-police sentiment fueled by a turbulent summer of demonstrations against police brutality.

Trump has taken a firm law and order stance.
