Retail and hospitality businesses face a 'bloodbath' of failures as landlords prepare to call in unpaid rent from lockdown. 

The Government's ban on evictions ends on October 1, meaning legal action can then be taken to evict tenants from thousands of shops, restaurants, bars and pubs.

Businesses already owe £3.5billion of unpaid rent and service charges before the September quarter is taken into account. 

Trade body UK Hospitality has called on the Government to extend rent relief until the end of March 2021. 

Describing the prospect as a 'bloodbath', UK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said: 'Later this month, many businesses will not be able to pay rent that is due. Thousands of sites and the jobs they support will be lost.'
