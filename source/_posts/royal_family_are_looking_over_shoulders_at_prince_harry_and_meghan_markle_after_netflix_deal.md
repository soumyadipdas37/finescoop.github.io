The monarchy has been 'left looking over its shoulder' at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle following their Netflix megadeal, a royal expert has claimed.

The Duke, 35, and the Duchess of Sussex, 39, who recently bought a $14million mansion in Santa Barbara, have signed a new deal with the streaming service which could be worth as much as $150million, and say they want to provide 'hope and inspiration' with their upcoming projects.

Prince Harry and Meghan failed to tell the Queen, 94, about their Netflix deal before announcing it to the world, with aides telling her about the couple's new venture - which involves a yet-to-be-named production company set on making documentaries, feature films and children's programming.

Writing in Town and Country, royal expert Victoria Murphy said the monarchy had been left 'looking over its shoulder', saying: 'Family members will be hoping that Harry and Meghan stick to the pledge that they made to “uphold the values of Her Majesty” in “everything they do.” 

The monarchy has been 'left looking over its shoulder' at Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 39, following their Netflix megadeal, a royal expert has claimed.

'Because, while they have no way of controlling the Sussexes, the actions of this couple will inevitably still reflect on the institution.'

She went on to say that while Prince Harry and Meghan may not have to engage or answer to critics, the monarchy 'does not have the same freedom.' 

Earlier this week, a royal source claimed the couple had failed to tell the Queen about their Netflix deal,  before announcing it to the world. 

A source told The Sun: 'Harry did not inform the Queen about the Netflix deal.' 

Writing in Town and Country, Victoria Murphy said members of the royal family 'will be hoping that Harry and Meghan stick to the pledge that they made to “uphold the values of Her Majesty” in “everything they do"' (pictured, the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton at the Commonwealth Service in March 2020)

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have never produced a TV show, will make documentaries, films, scripted and kids’ programmes in the new partnership.

'Her Majesty is all too aware of the pitfalls of when senior royals embark on lucrative projects - Prince Edwards’ production flop and some of the deals Sarah Ferguson has signed over the years to name a few,' the source told Fabulous.

'Her view is simple, the Royals are not for sale and danger surrounds high profile roles outside of the institution itself.'

They added, however, that the Queen, 'knowing her grandson Harry as she does', will appreciate that the duke and duchess can not be talked out of their plans. 

Harry and Meghan said last week they had founded a production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programmes.

Her comments come after it emerged the Duke and Duchess had signed a deal with Netflix said to be worth $150 million without informing the Queen 

They vowed to make 'impactful content that unlocks action' and name-checked Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos and spoke of the firm's 'unprecedented reach'.

They are expected to make content which includes work on 'mental health', an animated series about women, a nature documentary and shows on community service.

However, royal officials 'will examine Harry and Meghan's Netflix deal' after they agreed to approval of any new commercial ventures when they quit public life, according to a source.

A palace insider claimed that despite ditching official duties any profit-oriented plans would be 'subject to discussion'.

The source told the Mirror: 'Harry and Meghan did leave as working members of the family with everyone's best wishes and it is sincerely hoped they find the happiness that appeared to be lacking in their lives.

The royal expert commented that while The Firm has 'no way of controlling the Sussexes' their actions still 'reflect on the institution'

'However, it goes without saying any deals they are making will be scrutinised by the royal household.

'Under the terms of their deal to forgo their royal duties, they agreed any commercial deals would be subject to discussion.'

Harry and Meghan got the green light to broker commercial deals in January - but the moneymaking projects will be scrutinised by the Queen after a year.

The historic agreement ruled the couple will drop their HRH titles, pay back £2.4million of taxpayer cash and no longer receive public funds.

In exchange, they were allowed to quit frontline duties and given licence to expand their brand. 

The Queen released a statement at the time outlining how their new roles with the addition that they would 'continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty' in future work. 

The statement read: 'With The Queen’s blessing, the Sussexes will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.'
