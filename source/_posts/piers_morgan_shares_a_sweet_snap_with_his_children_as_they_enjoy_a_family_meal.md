Piers Morgan enjoyed a meal with his children on the weekend after his daughter Elise had her first week back at school since lockdown. 

Taking to Instagram on Sunday, the 55-year-old broadcaster shared a sweet snap with sons Stanley, 23, and Albert, 19, and eight-year-old Elise after dining at Cambio de Tercio in Kensington, London. 

Not seen in the snap were Piers' eldest son Spencer, 27, and wife Celia Walden, 44, who may have been taking the photo for the group.

Piers looked every inch the proud father in the snap as he beamed broadly while posing alongside his three youngest children. 

He captioned the image: 'Another fabulous meal at Cambio de Tercio. Thanks to Abel & his wonderful staff. 

'The food, wine & ambience are always great, but the service was off the charts tonight. You won’t get better treated anywhere in London.' 

Doting dad: Although Piers did not mention whether they were out celebrating any particular occasion, the week had marked daughter Elise's return to school

Although Piers did not mention whether they were out celebrating any particular occasion, the week had marked daughter Elise's return to school. 

Piers announced the news with Good Morning Britain viewers on Wednesday's show as he took a call from Elise live on air as he wished her good luck with the return. 

As the programme returned from an advert break, Piers was seen chatting on his mobile phone, where he revealed he was catching up with his daughter.

He told the camera: 'Just speaking to my daughter live on air, wishing her good luck for her first day back at school, and all her friends.

While his co-host Susanna Reid chimed in: 'Good luck Elise!'

Confirming that Piers was indeed on a real phone call, Susanna explained: 'He genuinely is talking to his daughter by the way.'
