Things got very awkward on Wednesday's episode of The Only Way Is Essex after Fran Parman decided to 'break the ice' with ex James 'Diags' Bennewith.

The two reality stars, both aged 29, called time on their romance in 2017 when they had an acrimonious split after she initially joined TOWIE as his housemate.

After being encouraged by her friends to talk to him, Fran headed over to Diags who was enjoying a socially-distanced drink with Amber Turner and Dan Edgar.   

Welcoming herself over with 'hi guys', Diags was left speechless to which she quipped: 'You all look like you've seen a ghost!'

To which the trio explained it was a 'surprise', Fran added: 'How are you? I just thought I'd come on over and say hello and see how is everything.'

Asked why she was at the bar, Fran said: 'I'm here with the girls so thought I would break the ice and say hello to everyone.'

'I've been great, yeah, come to see the girls and that, they said you were here when we walked in and I thought, "You know what, I'm going to break the ice." We haven't spoken for a year so I just thought I would come over.'

Sophie has dated the hunk for six months according to The Sun but the post was the first time they have gone public with their relationship.  

The couple met in February while they were volunteering in Uganda for a charity which helps children.

Diags split with Fran back in 2017 when they had an acrimonious split after she initially joined TOWIE as his housemate.  

She had starred on The Only Way Is Essex for seven series and was known for her relationship with Diags. They had dated for three years, before confirming their split in September 2017.

Sources claimed at the time that Fran 'felt lost' in the wake of their break up and was left upset after being sent messages alleging Diags had brought girls back to the apartment she had shared with him.

Insiders revealed at the time: 'They don't talk at all now that they've split... she is utterly heartbroken it's come from him and can't stop crying. 

'She never had any idea he was 'that' guy. They were best friends and best friends don't do that to each other.'
