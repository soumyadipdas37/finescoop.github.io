He returned home to his wife Jesinta Franklin and daughter Tullulah in Sydney after his AFL team Sydney Swans played their final game for the season last week.

But on Thursday, Lance 'Buddy' Franklin looked less than pleased to be on rubbish duty as he hauled a large bin outside his Rose Bay home.

The 33-year-old sports star showed off his tattooed arms in a beige coloured T-shirt as he took his rubbish bins out.

Buddy completed his casual ensemble with black shorts and a pair of beige sandals.

The sports star recently returned back home from Queensland after his team Sydney Swans were ruled out for the remainder of the AFL season.

However, Buddy didn't play a match in 2020 due to being sidelined after sustaining a hamstring injury.

Last month, it was revealed the Sydney Swans were temporarily relocating to Cairns over fears of the spread of coronavirus in New South Wales and Victoria.

Jesinta stayed behind in New South Wales for work commitments.

On September 6th, the mother-of-one was forced to celebrate Father's Day weekend without her husband, who was locked down at an AFL hub in Queensland.

She posted an Instagram photo of her Sydney Swans star husband pushing Tullulah's pram, alongside a bittersweet Father's Day tribute. 

Jesinta captioned the image: 'Happy 1st Father's Day @buddy_franklin23 . So sad we can't be with you today, we are sending lots of virtual cuddles via FaceTime.

'Big love to all the other families who can't be together today x,' she added.
