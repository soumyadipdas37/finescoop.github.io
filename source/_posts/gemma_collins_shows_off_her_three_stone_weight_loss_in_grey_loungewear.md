She has shed three stone so far this year thanks to controversial Skinny Jabs.

And Gemma Collins showed off the results of her recent weight loss with a stylish snap that she shared via Instagram on Friday.

The Diva Forever star, 39, looked sensational as she relaxed in grey velvet loungewear that she had designed for her bespoke clothing range. 

Wow! Gemma Collins showed off her three stone weight loss in chic grey loungewear as she promoted her new clothing range via Instagram on Friday

Posing on a plush sofa with a rose in her mouth, she shot a seductive look to the camera as she showed off the comfortable ensemble.

 Her golden locks were styled into loose waves that cascaded over her shoulder, and she wore a glamorous palette of make-up for the home photoshoot.

Gemma took the opportunity to promote her new range, as she wrote in the caption: 'I AM .... MY OWN WORK of ART.

'the countdown begins my beautiful luxury lounge wear designed by moi will be available from next week.'

Weight loss journey: Gemma has shed three stone so far this year thanks to controversial Skinny Jabs, and said she would 'recommend' it to others (pictured in July 2019)

Talking to PlayOJO bingo on Wednesday, Gemma said: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it. 

'It is a full programme, you get nutrition advice, nice recipes and guidance and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to lose weight.'

The television personality has previously come under fire for promoting the jab, which 'regulate the glucose level in your blood, allowing your body to use your stored fat for energy'.

 Trim: 'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective', Gemma said (pictured on Monday)

This means that you can safely consume small portions without experiencing the undesired effects of starvation mode.

Gemma continued: 'My advice to anyone looking to start a weight loss journey would be adopt the right mindset. 

'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective.'

Earlier this month, Gemma furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat'. 

Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body.

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand. So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' 

Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.
