Chelsea's new record signing Kai Havertz says the opportunity to work with Frank Lampard had a 'big impact' in his decision to move to Stamford Bridge. 

The 21-year-old finally completed a sensational £89m move to the Blues on Friday, in a fee which includes add-ons, after months of speculation about a transfer from Bayer Leverkusen. 

Havertz becomes the club's sixth major signing of an incredible transfer window, taking their total spending to an enormous £230m, and the man himself spoke glowingly about his new manager - both as a player and as a coach.

'Of course he had a big impact on my decision because I loved him as a player and watched him very often, and I think I can learn from him now he is a manager as well,' Havertz told the official club website. 

'I think he is a very humble person and a great guy and I can't wait to play with him and learn from him.

'He was very offensive like me and he loves to score goals, and I love to score goals as well so I think he will help me a lot in my position. Also maybe on the things that I can improve and I can't wait to work with him.'

The 21-year-old German has signed a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge to work with Lampard

Havertz's move makes the 21-year-old the joint most expensive player ever signed by a British club, along with Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United in 2016. 

The Premier League transfer record is £145m, which Liverpool received from Barcelona for Philippe Coutinho. 

Havertz, who is in the current squad with the German national team, will also join up with compatriots Antonio Rudiger and fellow summer signing Timo Werner in west London.

'I think it is very exciting because Chelsea has very young players and I know some of the players like Timo [Werner] and Toni [Rudiger],' Havertz added.

'I have played with them in the national team and they are good friends of mine and so I think this is very good for me.

'Also that Chelsea have very young players and English players and that is very nice and a big project. Hopefully we can have many successes.'
