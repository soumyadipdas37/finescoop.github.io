Nine newsreader Peter Overton received an Order of Australia medal on Wednesday.

And his wife Jessica Rowe shared a sweet photo of the couple after the ceremony to Instagram and said she's 'so proud' of her husband.

'My heart is full today! I'm so proud of my darling Petee. Today he received his AM for significant service to broadcast media and to the community,' she wrote.

Jessica, 50, added: 'He does so much, for so many, but he's so humble about what he does. I however will shout about his achievements from the rooftops!'

In the photo, the proud media personality couldn't wipe the smile off her face as she stood alongside Peter, who wore his medal.

Jessica's post comes after she shared photos to Instagram that showed her getting a mammogram on Tuesday.

She explained that it was her first time getting the test as she encouraged women to continue to get their health check ups throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

'Today I had my first ever mammogram!' Jessica wrote.

'Not enough of us are doing our regular health checks especially during this COVID times. We must!'

As an ambassador for the Sydney Breast Cancer Foundation, Jessica added that she is passionate about 'preventing breast cancer and supporting women, men and their families'.

Accompanying the powerful message were two pictures of the mum-of-two in a blue medical robe undergoing the mammogram.

One image showed Jessica's back as the radiographer attended to her while another image featured a side view of the x-ray in process.
