Learning to throw a boomerang is no laughing matter – just ask model Lara Stone and her boyfriend.

The couple appeared surprised to discover that the toy did exactly what it was supposed to when it came flying back towards them as they larked about in a London park.

Learning to throw a boomerang is no laughing matter – just ask model Lara Stone and her boyfriend

Dutch star Stone, 36, and her new love David Grievson, a property developer, were forced to take swift evasive action when it swooped towards their heads on its return journey.

The pair ducked into a crouch and covered their heads, hoping that the boomerang missed them – and their pet dog.

Dressed in a pair of on-trend polka dot trousers and Birkenstock sandals, a clearly-relieved Lara then burst into gales of laughter when she realised they had avoided an embarrassing accident. 

The fun-loving couple fell in love after meeting through the dating app Tinder in January 2018, more than two years after Stone split from her former husband, David Walliams.  

She began dating the Britain’s Got Talent judge in September 2009 and announced their engagement just four months later. 

They married at Claridge’s hotel in London in May 2010 with a no-expense-spared wedding and a star-studded guest list.

Three years later, Lara gave birth to the couple’s son, Arthur. 

But following a trial separation, Walliams filed for divorce, citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’, in September 2015.
