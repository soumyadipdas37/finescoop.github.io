Jackie 'O' Henderson recently moved into her new $11million property in Woollahra, Sydney, known as Cooper Park House. 

And on Thursday, the 45-year-old gave fans a peek inside the property as she unpacked with her nine-year-old daughter, Kitty. 

Posting to Instagram, the radio host shared a boomerang featuring herself and her daughter posing with several boxes from homeware store, Peter's of Kensington.

'Making our new house a home,' she captioned the boomerang. 

In the clip, Jackie and her daughter looked excited as they raised their arms in the air and swayed back and forth. 

Jackie looked chic in a long-sleeved black shirt, and she wore her blonde locks loose with minimal makeup. 

Meanwhile, Kitty looked over the moon in what appeared to be a patterned white T-shirt.
