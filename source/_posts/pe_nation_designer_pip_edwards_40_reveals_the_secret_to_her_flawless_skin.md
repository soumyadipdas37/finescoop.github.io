P.E Nation founder Pip Edwards is Sydney's streetwear queen. 

And now the 40-year-old has revealed the secret to her youthful glow, while enjoying a pampering session at her Bondi home. 

Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, the beauty pictured herself in an Estee Lauder sheet mask standing in front of a mirror.

Pip certainly looked in rejuvenation mode with her cropped blonde tresses wet from a shower while she was wrapped in a white robe.  

'Self care, YEAH....Mid-week Repair, Restore, Rejuvenate. Yes yes yes,' she captioned the photo, clearly excited for a beauty treatment.     

The beauty session comes after Pip debuted a fresh new haircut while attending a Pilates class in her signature activewear.

The businesswoman swapped out her shoulder length bob for a much shorter style.          

In the image, Pip stood on tip toes in a pair of orange exercise leggings and a black crop top from her own line, which revealed her super toned torso. 

The mother-of-one was smiling as she tipped her head to the side.

The blonde, who is currently dating former cricket captain Michael Clarke, captioned the post: 'Happy'. 

Pip also shared a series of images of her strenuous fluidform Pilates workout to her Instagram Story. 

In one image, Pip was balancing on her forearms and her feet were in straps on a reformer machine.

Another image showed Pip hanging upside down with both feet in the air while she gripped the bar above her. 

Last week Pip also turned heads by wearing a pair of nude-coloured leggings that made her appear naked at first glance.

Instagram fans did a double take as she uploaded a photo of herself modelling the optical illusion tights inside her Pilates studio.

Posing next to a reformer machine, a pouty-looking Pip wrote in the caption: 'Hands down my most favourite place to be ... the Pilates studio.'
