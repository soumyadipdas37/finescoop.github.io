Will Smith and Janet Hubert laughed together in a new on-set picture from the Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air 30th anniversary reunion.

The sweet snapshot seemed to signal the end of their feud, which has lasted since Janet was fired from the sitcom in 1993 and replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid.

HBO Max which carries the reunion said Will, 51, and Janet, 64, will be seen having an 'emotional reunion and a candid conversation,' Entertainment Weekly reports.

Will posted the picture of himself and Janet to Instagram while promoting the upcoming reunion special this week.

Alfonso Ribeiro, Tatyana Ali, Karyn Parsons, Joseph Marcell, Daphne Maxwell Reid and DJ Jazzy Jeff joined him in one picture.

The other showed him in what appeared to be a private screening room having his one-on-one confab with Janet, who played his character's Aunt Viv.

In his Instagram caption Will also wrote 'RIP James,' in reference to the show's main cast member James Avery who died in 2013 of open heart surgery complications.

His chat with Janet comes after she posted to her Instagram fan page urging Will to discuss their problems with her face to face.

'So September comes after August it's the 30th anniversary a Fresh Prince. And they want to start a war. Well here is my challenge - we can either keep this war going for another 30 years but I'm not going to, or you can sit down with me and talk to me and not about me Mr. Smith then let's do it,' wrote Janet.

'Can you only sit and talk about your strange unsavory problems in front of the world?' she said, apparently having a dig at Will's recent Red Table Talk with his wife Jada Pinkett Smith about her affair with R&B singer August Alsina. 

''Accept my challenge or shut up! Either you're telling the truth and the BLACK MEN of the cast are telling the truth or I'm telling the truth. And only YOU and I... and quite a few others, know the truth let's do this do YOU have the courage? #seeyouinseptember,' Janet concluded.

Will apparently accepted her challenge as the pair sat down for the reunion taping this Wednesday, 30 years to the day since the show premiered.

Janet has publicly held Will responsible for firing, calling him an 'egomaniac' during a 2011 interview where she said a reunion was off the table.

'There will never be a reunion...as I will never do anything with an a**hole like Will Smith,' she declared to TMZ, adding that 'This constant reunion thing will never ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn't know the word.'

Five years later she said on YouTube that while on the show she approached Will to help her and their co-stars negotiate a wage hike 'like they did on Friends.'

She claimed that Will rebuffed her efforts, alleging that he told her: 'My deal is my deal and y'all's deal is y'all's deal.'

'I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be The Aunt Viv Of Bel-Air Show because I know she is going to dog me in the press,' Will said on the radio in Atlanta the year she left the series.

'She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to nothing. She’s mad now but she’s been mad all along,' he insisted.

'She said once: "I’ve been in the business for 10 years and this snotty-nosed punk comes along and gets a show." No matter what, to her I’m just the AntiChrist.'

Four years ago Janet appeared on The Real and discussed the aftermath of her departure from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.

'Janet Hubert was never difficult on that set. Janet Hubert was so professional it wasn’t even funny. I think Will simply needed to win and I think sometimes when you get caught up in a lie – and those things never happened,' Janet insisted.

'She never left the set. I never left the set. We got along great. I think he was young and he was inexperienced and I think he simply had to win.'

Referring to Will's then-manager James Lassiter she said: 'I spoke to JL when my dad died and my brother died and I begged them, I said: "I have a family. I need you to tell the world that this stuff didn’t happen." And I was waiting in my heart thinking: "Somebody will come to me one day and help me," but they didn’t.'
