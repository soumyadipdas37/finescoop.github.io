Michael suffered a near-fatal brain injury back in December 2013 when he fell and hit his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in the French Alps.

Schumacher was placed in a medically-induced coma which he is now out of, but following the skiing accident seven years ago, his condition has been kept a closely guarded secret from those outside his Lake Geneva mansion.

Schumacher won 72 of his record 91 victories for Ferrari but was unable to be there to celebrate his former team's landmark race at Mugello.

The 21-year-old said it was an 'honour' to drive the iconic car around the old-school circuit

It is the second time Mick has driven his father's F2004 after he took it for a spin at the 2019 German Grand Prix to mark 15 years since Michael's iconic World title.

After coming back into the pits, Mick said: 'This was always a dream for me to drive this car.

'I drove the car at Hockenheim last year but to drive it at Mugello in non-rainy conditions has been an absolute honour.'

The sound of the V10 engine pleased many watching fans as they reminisced over the dominant car.

One fan, with Twitter username @RyanKeirWalker said 'That noise is incredible, need to bring it back' while @landomaxcharles said 'just leaving this playing in the background forever because it's literal heaven to the ears'.
