The Bachelor Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert has admitted to finding true love with his 'winning lady' this season.

And now secret Pinterest boards, created by Locky's two rumoured finalists, appear to hint at future wedding plans.

It seems that the former Australian Survivor star, 30, may be looking to propose or say 'I do' soon to his chosen ladylove if the surfaced accounts are anything to go by.

Pinterest is an image-sharing social media service designed to enable users to discover and save inspiration on digital pinboards.

Daily Mail Australia can reveal that both rumoured finalists Isabella 'Bella' Varelis, 25, and Irena Srbinovska, 31, have wedding boards on Pinterest. 

However, while one board hasn't been updated for nine months (before meeting Locky), another has 65 pins and was last updated in the past seven days.

Something to tell us? While Irena's Pinterest profile shares the same username as her Instagram, there wasn't a identifiable profile photo to confirm the board was hers

 While Irena has a wedding board on Pinterest, it hasn't been updated since last year - long before her red carpet debut with Locky was filmed for the series.

A source close to Irena told Daily Mail Australia that it was likely an account set up to help plan a ceremony or shower for a friend. 

However, Bella's Pinterest profile, which shares a photo that was previously shared to her Instagram in 2019, has been regularly updated throughout her Bachelor journey.

Her 'One Day' board features an assortment of engagement rings, outdoor wedding inspiration, backless bridal gowns and various wedding checklists. 

Bella has a total of 65 pins on her ever-growing wedding-inspo board and it was last updated in the past week.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska for comment. 

Confirmed: Bella's Pinterest profile shares the same Instagram username and uses a photo that was previously uploaded to her Instagram in 2019

Ready for the aisle? While doing early pre-promotional press for the reality TV dating series, Locky claimed he had found 'The One' and was beyond happy with his lady love

While doing early pre-promotional press for the reality TV dating series, Locky claimed he had found 'The One' and was beyond happy with his lady love.

In an interview with KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show in August, Locky admitted to bedding his winning contestant on the night of the finale.    

At the time, radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson mentioned to Locky that Bella was the bookies' favourite to win his heart on the show.

But he deflected this by saying: 'I was paying a favourite for Survivor on Sportsbet, and I clearly didn't win. They don't know what they're talking about.'

Victorian nurse Irena is currently the hot contender on the betting apps. 

The Bachelor continues on Wednesday from 7:30pm on Channel 10
