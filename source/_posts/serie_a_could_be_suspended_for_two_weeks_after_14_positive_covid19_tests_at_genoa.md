Serie A could be suspended for two weeks after 14 team members and staff tested positive for coronavirus at Genoa. 

Genoa were thrashed 6-0 by Napoli on Sunday but, according to La Repubblica,  Gennaro Gattuso's team will now have to all isolate until they have returned negative tests.

Genoa are scheduled to play Torino on Saturday while Napoli face Juventus.

With the international break on the horizon, a two-week pause on Italy's elite league would only disrupt the round of matches that are scheduled for this weekend.
