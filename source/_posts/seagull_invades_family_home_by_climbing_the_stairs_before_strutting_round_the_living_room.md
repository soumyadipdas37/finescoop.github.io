A brazen seagull spotted his opportunity when the backdoor of a house in Devon was left wide open.

 The bird broke into the family house in Newton Abbot, Devon when Beanie Rice, 14, accidentally left the backdoor of her home open.

A comical video shows the cheeky seagull going all the way up the stairs, leaving panicked family members scrambling to open a window.

The cheeky intruder scoffed some cat food in the kitchen but when Beanie tried to shoo the pesky bird, it went further in their home

Footage shows the gull boldly making its way up the stairs, surprised unsuspecting family members in the living room at the top.

Beanie screams a warning saying: 'The seagull's coming up the stairs!' as it flaps its wings to get to the top.

They recoil as the large bird invades the room and hops on top of the coffee table as panicked family members scrambled to open a window.

Luckily there was no damage caused to people or property and the seagull eventually left through an open window. 

Beanie said: 'I was quite shocked and confused, but it was also quite funny because it's not something you see every day.

'It got in from the back door because we had left some cat biscuits there, and then it wandered along the hallway.

'We were able to get it out through the window.'

The sneaky seagull, who the family have called Gregory Peck, was after a bite to eat and scoffed some cat food in the kitchen.
