James Middleton shared a photo of his stunning French fiancée Alizée Thevenet walking the dogs in nothing more than a pair of boots and a bikini. 

Taken from behind, the snap shows Alizée striding through a field somewhere in England in her string-tied swimwear and £115 black Hunter boots, with three of the couple's dogs running ahead. 

James, 33, posted the snap on Instagram this afternoon with the caption: 'When you think it’s nearly autumn but September throws you a heatwave.'

Followers were quick to comment on Alizée's 'amazing' outfit, with one saying: 'Love the beach look with the Hunter wellies. She is so cool.'

Another posted: 'I love this so much! Even here in Scotland it’s the same.'

It is not known where the photo was taken but the couple were recently seen house-hunting in Chelsea after spending lockdown at the Middletons' family home in Berkshire. 

James recently revealed they have been forced to postpone their wedding twice this year due to Covid-19. 

The original date was set for May before being pushed back to later in the summer. It is thought the nuptials are now planned for next year. 

James' sisters Pippa Middleton, her husband James Matthews, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will all attend. 

Despite the disappointing turn of events, it is clear James and Alizée are feeling loved-up as they look ahead to exchanging vows.

Earlier this month James gushed over his wife in a touching Instagram post.

Posting a series of holiday pictures from a couple's getaway in Sicily, he wrote: 'It’s a year since I asked Alizée to marry me… what a year it’s been! Two homes, lockdown, two attempts at a wedding, a litter of puppies, launching of new company @ella.co, a beard shave, and much more.'

He continued: 'The best part is that I get to share it with you Alizée and I can’t wait to take on whatever the future holds for us.'

The entrepreneur added: 'We managed to escape to Italy for a quick dip in the the sea, lots of wine and pasta and now ready to face the world again.'

Calling the yacht holiday an 'unforgettable experience', James also shared a number of snaps from the luxurious trip.

In the photographs, the couple could be seen relaxing on the deck of a lavish yacht, while James and Alizée also got behind the wheel of the boat.

The Duchess of Cambridge's brother announced his engagement to his French partner last October after he is believed to have proposed while in the Lake District. 

The couple spent lockdown at the Middletons' family home in Berkshire.
