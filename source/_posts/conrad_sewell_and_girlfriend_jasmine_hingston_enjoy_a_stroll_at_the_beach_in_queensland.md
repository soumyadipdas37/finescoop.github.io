He confirmed his relationship with new girlfriend Jasmine Hingston in March last year, and recently called her 'the one.'

And on Wednesday, Australian singer Conrad Sewell stepped out with his new squeeze Jasmine, who is a Brisbane-based makeup artist. 

Conrad, 32, showed off his buff physique and countless arm tattoos as he and Jasmine enjoyed a stroll at the idyllic Currumbin Beach in Queensland.

The hit maker, who is known for songs including Healing Hands and Start Again, cut a casual figure in a black Nike singlet.  

He teamed the look with black shorts, a cap, long white socks and white trainers.

Brunette beauty Jasmine meanwhile wore her activewear which included black leggings, a pink singlet and a khaki jumper tied around her waist.

She went makeup free and tied her short locks up and off her face. 

The pair appeared relaxed on the outing and appeared to have enjoyed a coffee run. 

At one point, Jasmine placed a loving arm on Conrad as they walked around the promenade. 

Conrad has previously described Jasmine as 'The One.'

'When it is right, it is easy,' he said.

'We have a very real relationship. It is hard being away from each other a lot, but we are working on that, we are making plans. I am all in,' Conrad revealed. 

The Healing Hands singer added that he's known Jasmine since he was a teenager.

Conrad first revealed his new love in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March last year.

While at a Sony Foundation event in Sydney, he said: 'I've got a new girl I've been hanging out with who's Australian.' 

The Brisbane-born pop star, who previously enjoyed a romance with Alli Simpson for just over a year, confirmed his mystery love was 'not a celebrity'.

'I've learnt from my mistakes,' he said with a laugh before adding: 'I don't want to date anyone in the public eye.'

Conrad and Alli first met in Australia at the 2015 ARIA Awards ceremony, but met up again at Coachella in April 2017 before dating shortly after.

However the high-profile pair's romance was short-lived with Alli confirming their split in June 2018.
