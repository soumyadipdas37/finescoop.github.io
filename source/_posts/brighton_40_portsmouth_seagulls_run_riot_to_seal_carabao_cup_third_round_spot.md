It was a comfortable night at the office for Graham Potter's side as they overcame Portsmouth 4-0 on Thursday in the Carabao Cup second round.

Alexis Mac Allister gave Brighton the lead in the 38th minute before Alireza Jahanbakhsh doubled that advantage inside 10 minutes of the second half.

Then Brighton strolled to victory as Bernardo and Viktor Gyokeres both added goals of their own at the Amex Stadium to seal their progression to the third round.
