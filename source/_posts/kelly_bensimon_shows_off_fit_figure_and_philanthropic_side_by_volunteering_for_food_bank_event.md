From model and socialite to magazine editor, author and reality star: Kelly Bensimon has worn many hats during her career.

Come Thursday, amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Bensimon showed off her philanthropic side when she helped hand out food to those in need in the wake of massive unemployment and homelessness.

And being an avid exercise queen, The Real Housewives Of New York City was still able to hit the streets of New York City afterwards and go for a run.

The Illinois native, 52, volunteered for a pop-up food pantry event hosted by Food Bank For New York City at Barclays Center in the borough of Brooklyn.

Dressed in a black 'I am for NYC' t-shirt and black jogging shorts, Bensimon was among the volunteers who distributed things like boxed meal and fresh produce, free of charge.   

In a show of just how much events like these are needed, people were lined up along barriers that were set up outside a number of storefronts that were used as storage spaces.
