Customers across Australia are rushing to get their hands on a new $49 kid's storage unit from Kmart that's half the price of other brands.

Mum Camilla raved about the product on social media and said the product is the budget equivalent of IKEA's Trofast storage unit.

'Loving our new toy storage solution thanks to Kmart! We were about to spend double the price for the same product at IKEA! Glad we waited,' Camilla said and shared an image to a popular Facebook group.

Camilla purchased three of the storage units to sit beside one another and each product has three deep tubs for storing toys.

'This configuration is three separate units side-by-side and screwed into the wall studs,' she said.

'The equivalent Trofast unit from IKEA is $84, and the dimensions are almost identical.

'Regarding the quality, the difference is minimal but like all things, you get what you pay for. They are very sturdy.'

The product is available at Kmart store locations but is currently sold out online, so shoppers should act quickly if they wish to purchase the product.

Mum Camilla first raved about the product on Facebook and said the product is the budget equivalent of IKEA's Trofast storage unit, which is priced at $84

'Loving our new toy storage solution thanks to Kmart! We were about to spend double the price for the same product at IKEA! Glad we waited,' Camilla said on Facebook

The online post quickly received more than 1,500 'likes' from other shoppers who were amazed with the budget buy.

'How good do these look!' one woman said.

'I'm so getting myself some of these,' another said.

A third added: 'My son's room is full of IKEA! Kmart why do you do this to me? Damn Kmart could of saved me so much!'

Others praised the simple but stylish design and said they'll definitely be heading to Kmart soon to purchase the product themselves before it sells out.
