President Donald Trump dared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to impeach him a second time after she refused to take that maneuver off the table to stall a Supreme Court vote. 

'I'm the only guy in the world that could be impeached for filling a seat,' Trump complained at his Toledo, Ohio rally Monday night, noting that he was 'constitutionally obligated' to nominate a new justice. 'Go ahead, I want them to do that.'       

Trump and Senate Republicans want to push through a GOP-approved Supreme Court pick to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the November election, when the White House and the Senate could change hands.

President Donald Trump complained Monday night at a rally at the Toledo Express Airport that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldn't take impeaching him again off the table. She suggested she could do it to stall him getting a replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsburg through 

'I'm the only guy in the world that could be impeached for filling a seat,' Trump told a crowd of supporters in Ohio Monday night. They chanted 'fill the seat' several times, to which the president promised he would 

Democrats are arguing that it's too close to the election, pointing to how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow Democratic President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland to get a vote because it was an election year. 

Garland was chosen by Obama in March 2016 a month after the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.  

During back-to-back campaign events Monday night in Ohio, Trump told crowds his pick would indeed be a woman and that he would announce her name on Friday or Saturday. 

At the Toledo Express Airport, Trump was met several times with 'fill the seat!' chants. 

On Sunday, Pelosi had refused to take a second impeachment off the table, saying that 'protecting our democracy requires us to use every arrow in the quiver.' 

On Monday night, Trump suggested Republicans would take back the House, which polling indicates will not happen. 

'We're going to take back the House, we're going to get rid of this "crazy" Nancy Pelosi,' Trump said. 'People are so tired of her.' 

He complained that he was originally impeached over a 'perfect phone call' with the Ukrainian president - a call a whistleblower reported amounted to a 'quid pro quo,' with Trump trying to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Hunter and Joe Biden, now officially his Democratic political rival. 

'Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I'm constitutionally oblicated to do to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States,' Trump said. 

As chants broke out asking Trump to 'fill the seat' the president responded, 'We will. We will.' 

'If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach you,' Trump said, continuing to knock Pelosi. 

He then turned his attention to Biden, who Trump called a 'stone cold loser' at one point. 

Trump blasted Biden for not providing a list of potential SCOTUS picks, suggesting it's because the Democrat would 'pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals.'  

'He knows they're too extreme to withstand any kind of public review,' Trump charged. 'So he doesn't want to show you who is judges are.'

'You would be unelectable,' Trump continued. 'Hopefully,' he's going to be unelectable anyway,' the president added.    

Trump recently expanded on his 2016 Supreme Court list including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley. 

 At the rally, the president echoed tweets he had put out earlier. 

'Crazy Nancy Pelosi wants to Impeach me if I fulfill my Constitutional Obligation to put forth a Nominee for the vacated seat on the United States Supreme Court. This would be a FIRST, even crazier than being Impeached for making a PERFECT phone call to Ukrainian Pres,' Trump tweeted Monday morning.
