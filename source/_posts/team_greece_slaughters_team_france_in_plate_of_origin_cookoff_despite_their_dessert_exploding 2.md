On Monday night's episode of Plate Of Origin, there was an explosive start to the cook off - literally. 

Team Greece - cousins Dezi, 42, and Penny, 33 - found themselves suffering a dramatic hiccup when the dough for their loukoumades exploded. 

The pair were making a loukoumades, fig and ice cream dessert when Dezi urgently called Penny over to the fridge.   

Oh dear: On Monday night's episode of Plate Of Origin, Team Greece - cousins Dezi, 42, and Penny, 33, (both pictured) - found themselves suffering a dramatic hiccup when the dough for their loukoumades exploded

'Penny! You better come over here. Don't freak out you gotta come over here!' she cried out. 

When Penny arrived at the fridge, she gasped as she saw a bowl of dough that had expanded and burst all over the fridge.   

'Oh my god! It's exploded! It's exploded! My god it's exploded!' she cried out in panic. 

Whoops: The pair were making a loukoumades, fig and ice cream dessert when Dezi urgently called Penny over to the fridge

There she blows: 'Oh my god it's everywhere, there is dough dripping off, like, literally strands dripping off the shelf,' Dezi said

Rush job: The only choice for the pair of cooks was to start over and Penny quickly got to work on a new batter

'It's like a volcano has erupted in the fridge,' she added.  

'Oh my god, it's everywhere, there is dough dripping off, like, literally strands dripping off the shelf,' Dezi said. 

The only choice for the pair of cooks was to start over and Penny quickly got to work on a new batter.  

'I've seen you make a cake - a whole cake - for a birthday party in under 45 minutes, you can do this!' Dezi encouraged her. 

Winners: The pair not only managed to complete and plate their dessert, they left Team France, entrepreneurs Austine, 28, and Leo, 32, (pictured) quaking in their wake

Looking good: The Greek team crushed them with 49 out of 60 with their main of octopus with garlic mash and loukoumades dessert

She added with a laugh: 'We wouldn't be Greek without the drama'.
