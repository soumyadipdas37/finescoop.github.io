Jennifer Garner has been enjoying some quality family time at home during the summer quarantine with her kids.

But the Golden Globe winner is a mom-on-the-go once again, as kids get back to virtual learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

She cut a casual mom look Monday in a white t-shirt and jeans, as she hand-delivered some flowers to a friend's office in her upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The 48-year-old showed her support for the LA Fire Department amid the wildfires blazing down the West Coast, as she sported an 'LAFD Strong' t-shirt.

She wore the top partially tucked into some distressed faded jeans, with a pair of white sneakers, while carrying a taupe leather tote bag over her shoulder.

Garner completed the look with a pair of chunky round tortoiseshell sunglasses, a nautical striped face mask, a navy blue Apple Watch and a gold bangle. 

She recently squashed a pregnancy rumor before it had the chance to catch on, after posting a video in overalls from her family's farm in Oklahoma.

One of her 9.7million Instagram followers asked a bold question in the comment section: 'Are you pregnant?'

The Alias star responded: 'I am 48, have three healthy kids, and am not—and never will be—pregnant. We can lay that pupper to rest. Have a gained the Covid 19? Possibly. But that is another story.'

Garner posted a tribute to educators last week on Instagram, writing: 'Thank you for the gifts and lessons of this summer. God bless teachers, faculty and administrators as they guide us through this big question mark of a school year. 

'Bless the parents trying to make it all work. And the children who are learning to make the best of things in ways we couldn’t have predicted. Help us remember we hold each other in our hands. And please God, preserve our collective sense of humor. Amen.'
