Large parts of Australia are set for a wet and windy weekend - with a weather system bringing torrential rain, hail and destructive winds making its way across the country.

Severe thunderstorms will develop over central areas of the country on Saturday - including South Australia and western New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. 

Rain is forecast in mainland capital cities, while supercells are possible in southwest Queensland where severe winds and even tornadoes could form.

Severe weather warnings are in place for South Australia, southeast parts of the Northern Territory, southwestern Queensland and northwest parts of Victoria (pictured: students stand in the rain in Melbourne in June)

The red areas on the map above indicate areas of high wind with tornadoes possible in southeast Queensland on the weekend 

South Australia will receive the heaviest rainfalls courtesy of a low pressure system, particularly in the eastern parts of the state on Saturday afternoon.  

Severe weather warnings are in place for South Australia, southeast parts of the Northern Territory, southwest Queensland and northwest parts of Victoria. 

Western areas of New South Wales are also urged to stay alert for severe thunderstorms. 

The east coast of the country will also experience rain throughout the weekend directed by a high pressure system further north. 

Some areas of the country are forecast to receive a drenching and could see more than their average Spring rainfall in two days.  

'There is a large low pressure system that is dragging a lot of pressure from the north to the south,' Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Grace Legge told Daily Mail Australia.

'We will see steady rainfall over the next 24 to 48 hours. But embedded in that, we will also seeing thunderstorms which will bring quite significant rainfall in a very short period of time which could lead to flash flooding.' 

Over 50mm of rain is expected in parts of inland Australia, where the average annual rainfall is normally about 200mm.     

Sydney is in for a wet weekend with showers expected on Saturday (pictured) and Sunday 

This could cause roads to be cut off making some communities inaccessible.  

In Queensland most of the wild weather will be in the west, however, the east coast is set to see some rain.  

'We have a warning for parts of southwest Queensland in place on Friday and there is a chance we might get thunderstorms that bring large to giant hail,' Ms Legge said. 

Temperatures will hover around average with a highs of 25C in Brisbane. 

South Australia and the Northern Territory will see strong winds with some gusts over 100km/h and thunderstorms. 

Temperatures will be in the low 20s in South Australia and rising towards the low 30s further north.    

Regional Victorians in the northeast of the state are being warned to stay indoors on Saturday with 10-20mm of rain expected fall. 

The State Emergency Service is advising residents who may travel or camp over the weekend to monitor conditions.

'We encourage people to avoid setting up camp under trees or on low-lying areas alongside creeks or rivers,' Commander David Tucek said.

There are severe thunderstorm warnings in place for the southwest of Queensland

There are is also a thunderstorm warnings in place for the northwest of Victoria

He said residents should clean their gutters, downpipes and drains to prevent blockages and clear loose items from backyards.  

Temperatures will remain moderate throughout the state.  

The build up of moisture is also set to wreak havoc on the western half of NSW tomorrow with severe thunderstorms.

The rest of the state is also set for a wet weekend with cooler temperatures especially in Sydney which will see highs of 21C. 

Overnight temperatures are also set to be chilly in Canberra, Sydney Perth and Hobart which are expected to approach 10C. 

Perth will also see some rain and a cooler weekend with high of just 19C.  

On Saturday, regional Victorians in the northeast of the state are being warned to stay indoors with 10-20mm of rain expected fall (pictured: rain disrupts commuters in Geelong)

The east coasts capital cities are likely to avoid the worst of the wild weather. 

'The more significant rainfall probably won't make it to the east coast capitals like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne,' Ms Legge said.

'But on Sunday we will see that rainfall heads to the coast, but it will have lost a lot of its power by then.

'However, Canberra could see about 10mm of rain.'

Although low pressure systems usually mean a cold snap, on this occasion, it might actually get warmer. 

'It will actually increase the temperature, It's a very warm air mass and a lot of the areas will probably experience quite muggy, humid temperatures,' Ms Legge said.   

The system is expected to ease late on Sunday before it then moves offshore.
