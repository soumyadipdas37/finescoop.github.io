Irina Shayk and art dealer Vito Schnabel first sparked relationship rumors when they were seen together in late March.

And it seems like the pair have continued to spend quarantine getting to know each other, seen meeting up at an NYC park on Sunday.

The Russian model, 34, looked radiant in a silky, white dress as she played with daughter Lea while Schnabel - an ex of Amber Heard and Heidi Klum - looked on.

Fast as he can: Vito looked like he may have jogged to the park, seen with running shoes, headphones and a scarf around his neck 

Irina was all smiles as she lead her three-year-old to the park wearing a sexy summer dress, which featured delicate illustrations and the phrase 'No more violence' emblazoned upon it.

The brunette beauty - who shares Lea with ex Bradley Cooper - had her hair pulled into a low bun while keeping her face at a makeup-minimal glow.

Once they arrived at the park, Irina ditched her shoes and went barefoot. Shortly after they settled down, pal Vito arrived.

It looked like he might have jogged over, seen donning headphones, a scarf, and running shoes with his casual look.

More than friends? 'Irina has known Vito for years and they've always been friends. They used to double date when Vito was with Heidi and Irina was with Bradley,' an E! News insider explained. The pair are seen April 1 st 2020 above

While it's unclear if they're an item, the pair are definitely close according to an E! News source from April.

'Irina has known Vito for years and they've always been friends. They used to double date when Vito was with Heidi and Irina was with Bradley,' they explained.

Quarantine left the pair plenty of free time to spend together, according to the insider who added: 'Now, they are both single and quarantined in New York.'

'Vito is a big flirt and Irina is his type,' they went on. 'She likes the attention. They are neighbors and are spending a lot of time together. When Irina's daughter is with Bradley [Cooper], she has downtime and she likes the company. It's easy for right now to see Vito and go over to his place. They've been spending all day together and the evenings as well. She likes connecting with someone she is comfortable with.'

Irina and Bradley began dating in 2015 but split in June 2019.

The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their very busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.  

'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she’s back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March.

'He’s been making an effort to take projects that aren’t too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he’s very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he’d carry her everywhere.' 

'He’s totally devoted to Lea, it’s really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.

Right now, Bradley is in California, where he has been shooting a new and yet-to-be titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.
