Jacinda Ardern has made a special visit to a small New Zealand community devastated by the White Island volcano disaster.

A total of 21 people, including 14 Australians, were killed when the volcano erupted on the island on December 9 last year.

Many were holidaymakers on a cruise visiting the iconic attraction with their families, before their lives were ripped apart in a matter of minutes.

On Wednesday morning the New Zealand Prime Minister made her first visit since the disaster to Whakatane, the seaside town just 50km away from the island.

Ms Ardern met for morning tea with a series of workers who were first at the scene and who witnessed the horror unfold.

These included Ngati Awa, the local Maori community, as well as helicopter pilots, coast guard, St John's ambulance workers and staff at the Whakatane Hospital.

But despite the heartache felt across the community, Ms Ardern said she received letters from many who still thought of Whakatane fondly.

'In the aftermath of Whakaari I received a lot of letters from those who had lost loved ones, particularly those who were overseas. Many of those came from our Australian friends,' she said. 

'I was deeply moved by those letters.

'In a circumstance where it would be completely understandable to feel such pain and grief when you think of New Zealand and when you think of Whakatane, yet the opposite was true.

'Those letters often detail the close connection that they feel here to this place, and to all of you.

'And in some cases they even said that if they were to lose a loved one anywhere, this is the place that they would want to be safe and held and cared for.

'That in my mind has happened as a result of the way you responded.' 

Tamsin Davies, the clinical lead at Whakatane Hospital's emergency department, held back tears as she remembered the traumatic days that followed the eruption.

She said dozens of victims presenting with horrific burns and internal injuries remained 'incredibly' etched on her memory.

'You wouldn't be human if it wasn't,' Dr Davies said.

'It's not just us as the hospital staff that it will have a lasting effect on, I think it's the country.

'I have incredible pride in our team, and how everyone helped each other and helped all of the casualties that we had.'

Dave van Dyke, a registered nurse and Whakatane Hospital coordinator, said the town would always remember the Australian medics who flew to NZ for support.

Ms Ardern (pictured, with locals) said it was heartwarming to see how the community came together in the wake of the volcano eruption

'We had a number of nurses that came across after the event and they were a vital part of our support, and part of our recovering the days after the event as well. For that we're extremely grateful,' he said.

A number of inquiries - including a multi-million dollar WorkSafe probe - have been launched into the disaster.

There were 47 people on the island when its volcano erupted, with those lucky enough to make it out alive carrying painful scars and lifelong disfiguring. 

Trips out to the island once brought in more than $4million a year but it is now deserted, with the layers of ash a reminder of the disaster.

The eruption trapped tourists on the island, many unable to outrun the plumes of acidic gas and ash that surrounded them.

Some saw their entire families wiped out, others suffered excruciating burns to nearly all of their bodies and many have undergone dozens of surgeries or been placed into long comas.

Among the list of victims was Melbourne father Paul Browitt and his 21-year-old daughter Krystal. 

His 23-year-old daughter Stephanie received third degree burns to 70 per cent of her body and lost a number of her fingers. 

She was one of the few survivors who was airlifted off the island by a rescue helicopter. 

24 Australians were among 47 tourists on New Zealand's White Island when it erupted.
