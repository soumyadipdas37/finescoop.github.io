Six months on from announcing she would return as a muse for Dave E Kelley, Nicole Kidman teased fans with a behind the scenes glimpse of their new project.

The Australian actress, 53, issued a sneak peek of 'what doing press looks like these days' ahead of the release of HBO series The Undoing on October 25.

The star, who announced that she would collaborate with the screenwriter in March, was pictured looking back at the camera as she face-timed on Wednesday.

While the series was originally scheduled to debut in May, its date was pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nicole will star alongside Hugh Grant, Edgar Ramirez, Noah Jupe and Donald Sutherland in the drama adapted from Jean Hanff Korelitz's bestselling novel, You Should Have Known.

'Getting closer and closer to sharing @UndoingHBO with you,' she captioned her post on Instagram.

'Here's a little behind-the-scenes at what doing press looks like these days xxx.'

Nicole's post was accompanied by a comment by The Undoing HBO's official Instagram account, which stated 'all will be revealed ...' in time.

Multiple trailers of the taut and suspenseful six-episode series have been released the past six weeks.

The latest, uploaded on Monday, shows a softer side to Nicole, who will play Grace Fraser - an Upper East Sider whose life as a therapist in New York is upended in the psychological drama.

She is playing the wife of Hugh Grant's character Jonathan, who is an oncologist and devoted father to their son.

The series follows the life their characters always wanted, which comes crashing down following a violent death and chain of revelations.

Nicole shared a glimpse of how the duo were working together on set earlier this month by uploading a picture wishing the actor happy birthday as they crossed a bridge they were filming on.

She was pictured wearing a green dress while Hugh sported a dark blue button shirt and jeans.

Nicole is coming off staring in Bombshell and The Goldfinch, and playing Celeste Wright in HBO drama Big Little Lies.

The series explores the complex and disturbing marriage between Celeste and Perry Wright - played by Alexander Skarsgård.

In an emotional interview this month, Keith Urban opened up about what it was like watching his wife on Big Little Lies.

The country music star admitted it was 'very heavy' to see his wife portray domestic violence scenes, and had to remind himself Nicole was 'just acting'.

'My soul is just alerted to this fear. [I have to tell myself] "It's okay, mate, It's okay. She's just acting. Just calm down, she's just acting",' the 52-year-old said. 

'It's hard to tell your soul that she's an actor and she's acting.

'It was very heavy to watch, because she's so bloody good [at acting].'
