A life-sized cake of actor Colin Firth has been created to celebrate the anniversary of Pride and Prejudice.  

The six foot-tall cake of Mr Darcy has been created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the BBC mini-series.

It was unveiled at the National Trust property Lyme Park, in Cheshire, which was used as the character's home of Pemberley in the adaptation.

Cake artist Michelle Wibowo, who created the sponge Mr Darcy, said she 'couldn't be happier' with the results.

'What better reason than the 25th anniversary of the series of Pride And Prejudice to create a birthday cake to celebrate,' she said.

Ms Wibowo worked on the life-sized cake for more than 200 hours. 

She started by sketching a model based on the 1995 TV adaptation, which will be re-broadcast as part of Jane Austen season on TV station Drama.

The cake itself contains 20kg of flour, 20kg of butter and 45kg of sugar.

'I've created cakes of everyone from the Queen to Beyonce, but Mr Darcy officially tops the list as the most delicious model I've ever made,' Ms Wibowo said.

'I hope his legions of fans will approve!'

Jane Austen season on Drama will air on Sundays, September 6-20.
