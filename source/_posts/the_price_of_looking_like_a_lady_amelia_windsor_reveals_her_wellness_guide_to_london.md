Lady Amelia Windsor has revealed her wellness guide to London - including a 'scary and painful' laser hair removal and a lavish £250 facial.

The 24-year-old model, who is 39th in line to the throne, made the revelations in society bible Tatler, where she holds the title of contributing editor. 

Lady Amelia, who has been crowned the most beautiful member of the royal family in the past, suggested readers splash the cash at clinics across London featuring organic serums and sustainable products.

From her £2,500 Mrs Smooth hair removal routine to a bespoke 'Body Balancer' treatment at a membership gym and spa, Lady Amelia has given a glimpse into everything it takes to perfect the royal look.

'Body balancer treatment' - £130 per month

The royal, who is based in Notting Hill but lived in Cambridgeshire with her family during the pandemic, revealed she is a member of Bodyism, a holistic wellness company.

The brand has bases in Westbourne Grove, London and Heckfield Place in Hampshire as well as an international base within a luxury membership gym on Saadiyat Island.

Writing in Tatler, Lady Amelia said she is partial to one of the company's 'famous Signature classes' which is described online as 'carefully designed to strengthen and tone your whole body through a dynamic fusion of interval training, pilates and yoga, meditation and stretching.'

Among the London hotspots recommended by the royal, who is 39th in line to the throne, is membership spa and gym Bodyism 

Meanwhile she said she likes to follow up a work out with the Body Balancer treatment, where she 'slips inside a cosy padded sleeping bag for 45 minutes as it tightens and loosens around your body to increase circulation and reduce fluid retention.'

She notes she leaves 'feeling toned and alleviated of tension in the body' allowing 'a calmer mind' and also said it 'much improves' her sleep quality.' 

£250 organic facial

Lady Amelia gushed over Joanne Evan's Holland Park clinic Skin Matters, which she said 'feels more like a beautifully decorated home.'

As well as hosting events and workshops during normal times, the royal revealed she likes to retreat down the winding staircase to the 'cosy treatment rooms' which come complete with a 'fluffy duvet' for 'maximum indulgence.'

Meanwhile Lady Amelia also recommended clinic Skin Matters in Holland Park, where treatments cost upwards of £170 

Lady Amelia insisted that Joanne knows how to keep skin glowing with a range of organic and sustainable skin care products. 

Facials online range in price from £170 to £480, with the advanced vitamin facial seeing soundwaves massaged over your face and neck to 'penetrate the most active ingredients of vitamins 4,000 times deeper into your skin.'    

£2,500 Mrs Smooth laser hair removal

Despite calling the process 'painful' and 'rather scary', Lady Amelia also revealed another crucial part of her beauty regime is laser hair removal.

She said she 'relied upon' Santi, a small 'peaceful' beauty clinic in the centre of South Kensington, for the procedure and called  Tariq and his team 'like a family'.

Another clinic mentioned on the royal's wellness guide to the capital was Santi, where she said the manager Tariq and his team were 'like a family'

Prices range from £65 for a single treatment on the nipple, up to £2500 for a full 'Mrs Smooth' package, which promises to rid the entire body from hair in just six treatments.

Meanwhile men looking at the same treatment could expect to pay £3,000 at the beauty clinic. 

£65 pampering manicure  

Lady Amelia also revealed she relies upon the local nail salon Portobello Girl for manicures and pedicures, with a combination of both treatments costing £65. 

She said the plant filled salon is one of her favourites in the area while praising the owner Aya for making visitors feel 'instantly at home.'  

The royal revealed the treatments always left her with a smile on her face.
