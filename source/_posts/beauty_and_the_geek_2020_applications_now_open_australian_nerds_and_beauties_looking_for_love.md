Applications are now open for Australian nerds and 'beauties' looking for love on the next season of Beauty and The Geek.

The revived dating series is making a comeback in 2021 - and will appear on screens nationwide after being axed by Channel Seven in 2014.

It will be hosted by former Bachelorette turned Love Island presenter Sophie Monk, who has had her fair share of unlucky-in-love moments in the public eye.

The post read: 'Casting: Beauty and The Geek ... Tag your beautiful or unlucky in love smarty pants friends - we want to hear from you all.'

The rebooted series will be part of Nine's prime-time schedule next year, alongside Celebrity Apprentice Australia. 

Casting for the upcoming season extended to the company's website, calling for all 'big-hearted beauties' and 'geeky guys' to come forward. 

Contestants will be required to compete in 'primarily academic subjects' and vie for popularity in the 'social realm' as part of the show. 

Winners of the challenges then go onto select two teams to compete against each other in an elimination quiz, with the losers being sent home.

'The last teams standing battle it out for the cash prize and the coveted title of Beauty and the Geek champions 2021,' the company's casting call read.

Beauties and geeks are also required to be single and between the ages of 18 and 35 years.

In a statement on September 16, Nine said the 'big-hearted program' would 'showcase the power of love on the inside as a fresh group of beauties and geeks from all over the country test their brains and their charisma'.

'The new Beauty and the Geek promises to deliver laughs, tears and everything in between as two groups of people from completely different worlds are set to collide,' Nine's statement read.

'From the producers of ratings phenomenon Married at First Sight, Beauty and the Geek finds a new home on Nine with a rejuvenated and reimagined format as it explores the old saying that you can't always judge a book by its cover.' 

The initial series, which ran for six seasons from 2009, was cancelled after ratings flopped.
