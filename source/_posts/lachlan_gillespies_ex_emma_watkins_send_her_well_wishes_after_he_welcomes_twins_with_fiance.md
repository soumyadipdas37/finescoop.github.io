The 'Purple Wiggle' Lachlan 'Lachy' Gillespie and his ballet dancer fiancée Dana Stephensen welcomed twin daughters on Friday.

Fans were left in complete shock when The Wiggles performer unveiled the new arrivals on Friday evening on Instagram, as Dana's pregnancy had never been revealed publicly. 

And following the joyous news, the couple have been inundated with well wishes from a number of Australian celebrities, including Lucy Durak, Melissa Doyle and even Lachy's ex-girlfriend Emma Watkins.

In an Instagram post, the 34-year-old shared a photo of his newborn daughters - Lulu and Lottie - resting with their mother Dana, 34, as he looked on lovingly. 

He wrote in the caption: 'Oh Lulu and Lottie, your mummy and daddy love you with all we have - you are both so beautiful - and I would love to sing to you both forever'. 

Neither Lachlan nor Dana gave any hint that they were expecting, and their social media accounts do not show many recent photos.  

Lachy wrote in the caption: 'Oh Lulu and Lottie, your mummy and daddy love you with all we have - you are both so beautiful - and I would love to sing to you both forever'

The couple announced their engagement in April in a sweet Instagram post, with Lachy writing: 'On Thursday night, Dana asked me to marry her at home under a fairy light sky and a very excited little boy in a beautiful bow tie.' 

In the photo, Lachlan was pictured cuddling up to Dana and Dana's son Jasper, four, inside a bedroom festooned with fairy lights. 

The couple, who went public with their relationship in October, beamed with joy as they cuddled up for the milestone photo.

Dana and Lachlan are living together as they self-isolate amid the COVID-19 pandemic.    

Lachlan separated from his Wiggles bandmate Emma Watkins (a.k.a. The Yellow Wiggle) in August 2018, after two years of marriage. 

He confirmed his romance with Dana in October 2019 when he shared a selfie of the pair to Instagram. 

On New Year's Day, Lachlan revealed that he'd met Dana's son Jasper, four, who she shares with her photographer ex-husband, Michael Kai.

Meanwhile, Lachlan and his ex-wife Emma continue to be on good terms, despite their very public divorce. 

Speaking to Who in August last year Emma said: 'We are the best of friends and we were always meant to be. We were close before we started dating and now we've come full circle!' 

Meanwhile, Emma is dating The Wiggles' musician Oliver Brian, 32.
