A Woolworths employee has revealed she was abused at work over the supermarket's decision to end the hugely popular Disney+ Ooshie promotion early.

Woolworths confirmed on Monday the supermarket chain would run out of the mini figurines by this weekend due to 'extraordinary demand'. 

The employee took to Twitter on Tuesday night to shed light on how Woolworths staff members has been mistreated by customers because of the promotion.    

'Only three hours into my shift and I've copped more abuse than I have over the past three years because of these Ooshies,' she wrote.    

A Woolworths employee has revealed she was abused by customers at work after the supermarket ended its Disney+ Ooshies (pictured) collectables promotion early 

Woolworths (pictured) planned to run the Disney figurine promotion until October 20 but revealed stocks would run out this weekend due to 'extraordinary demand'

Customers receive one of the Ooshies for every $30 spent in store. There are 36 Disney+ Ooshies, with the popular promotion combining the worlds of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.  

Other customers have also shared their observations of crazed shoppers verbally abusing Woolworths staff members.    

'Poor girl that works at my local Woolies was in tears after copping a verbal beating from some knob because they were out of Ooshies,' one user wrote. 

'Every time I've gone to Woolworths, there's some Ooshie related fight going on.

'“What do you mean the Ooshies are out of stock? I bought so much groceries because my kids want Ooshies! Unbelievable!",' another commenter said.      

Woolworths has urged customers to treat supermarket staff with respect.    

'The safety of our team members is our top priority and we will not accept customer abuse in any circumstance.

'Our team members are doing the very best they can to look after our customers, so please support them, and each other,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.   

Woolworths employees and shoppers (pictured in a Woolworths store) took to social media to share instances where staff had been mistreated over the Ooshie collectables 

The supermarket giant also said the incidents were isolated and did not appear to be widespread across stores.   

'We've found the vast majority of customers have been respectful towards our team members and we thank them for their patience,' the spokesperson said. 

The Disney collectables were initially supposed to be available until October 20. 

Woolworths also told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday the promotion had to end early because the Ooshies were 'extraordinarily popular with customers'.    

'These collectibles take more than 12 months to plan and the quantity produced is based on our experience of running many collectible campaigns that we've previously offered. 

'To our customers, we thank you for your excitement and engagement with the Disney+ Ooshies and apologise for any frustration or disappointment caused by running out of stock,' the spokesperson said. 

The Ooshie collection was launched in Victoria last week after a delayed start due to Stage Four lockdown. 

Woolworths said that staff abuse over Ooshies (collection pictured) was not happening at all stores and there had only been 'isolated cases' at some supermarkets
