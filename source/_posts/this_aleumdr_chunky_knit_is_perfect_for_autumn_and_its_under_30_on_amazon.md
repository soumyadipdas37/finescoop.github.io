One reviewer wrote: 'This jumper is lovely, I'm a size 14 and ordered the XL as I like a looser fit and it was perfect. I was worried it would swamp me but it didn't.

'I actually love it,' wrote one happy shopper 'I bought it mainly for warmth and comfort but this looks incredibly flattering on.

'The arms are long enough, it covers my bum which is what I wanted but it hugs the figure nicely. I'll buy this in another colour now also because it's so nice on.'
