Rebel Wilson has given fans a look at her office. 

The 40-year-old proved she was a woman of style when she took to Instagram on Sunday to showcase the fancy set-up. 

The Pitch Perfect star showcased a white-panelled room which she decorated with a wooden desk along with a white office chair.

A small decorative table sat behind her with decorative drawings along with a black block which had '#Pitch' written on it.

It comes as Rebel revelled in her incredible year of health and fitness, losing at least 18kg over the past 12 months. 

On Friday, the Australian actress drew attention to her shrinking frame in a chic ensemble, in photos shared to Instagram.

The beauty revealed a glimpse of cleavage and her tinier waist in a white top and black pants, as she posed on a couch with an adorable pooch in Los Angeles. 

Rebel added a chic red cardigan and white loafers to the look, and swept her blonde locks into a sleek high ponytail.

She appeared to have worn minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine through.

'I made a new friend today x thanks Aunty Hilary,' Rebel captioned a sweet photo shared to her official page, of the dog resting its paw on her leg.

The Pitch Perfect star also shared a near-identical photo with the pooch to her Instagram Stories.
