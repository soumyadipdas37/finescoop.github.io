Paul Merson has slammed Kai Havertz for an 'uninterested' Premier League debut last week and called for the German to improve his attitude.

The German attacking midfielder joined the Blues this summer from Bayer Leverkusen in a £89million move and made his debut in the west Londoners' 3-1 win over Brighton last Monday.

Havertz did not get on the scoresheet before being taken off with ten minutes to play and Merson claimed the 21-year-old did not look up for his Premier League debut. 

Kai Havertz had an 'uninterested' debut for Chelsea in their win over Brighton says Paul Merson

The ex-Arsenal man said the 21-year-old German did not play well nor look interested

The former Arsenal midfielder told the Daily Star: 'Kai Havertz has got a lot do. He didn't play well.

'He didn't even look interested at times. When he came off, he didn't really seem to care. It was strange.'

Havertz is part of Frank Lamapard's £200million overhaul of the Chelsea squad this summer which has seen fellow German Timo Werner arrive at the club for £47.5million from RB Leipzig. 

Having defeated Brighton in their opening game of the season, the Blues side travel to Premier League champions Liverpool on Sunday in a match which could determine how successful the summer spending has been.

Former Chelsea defender Frank LeBoeuf believes that Lampard should not play Havertz if he is not physically ready to play.

The German joined on September 4, just eight days before the start of the Premier League in a period which was affected by the international break. 

LeBeouf told ESPN: 'I think Frank Lampard should line up the players who are ready, who are ready to compete.

'If Havertz is not ready, if he's physically not ready, he shouldn't play... Chelsea have to show that they can fight with Liverpool.'
