The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert shocked Australia on Thursday when he told both his finalists he'd fallen in love with them - only to dump Bella Varelis and pursue a relationship with Irena Srbinovska.

But it turns out there may have been more to the story.

Some pretty wild rumours about the season finale surfaced overnight - and if they're true, Locky has a lot of explaining to do.

The Bachelor's final blindside: Locky Gilbert (right) reportedly texted Bella Varelis (left) the night before the finale assuring her she'd be the winner', only to dump her for Irena Srbinovska

As reported by gossip website The Wash, the former Survivor star's 'last blindside' was even more brutal and confusing than what was shown on TV.

While viewers saw Locky, 31, tell Bella, 25, he was falling in love with her during their helicopter date, things reportedly didn't end there.

He allegedly texted the marketing consultant before filming the last episode to 'reassure her' she would be his winner - making his eventual decision all the more hurtful and bewildering for her.

Rumours: As reported by gossip website The Wash , the former Survivor star's 'last blindside' was even more brutal and confusing than what was shown on TV

The website quoted an anonymous source, who had been 'present for the majority of filming', as saying: 'Locky gave her a lot of reassurance that it was going to be her at the end.

'He even texted her saying he couldn't wait to make her happy for the rest of her life and talked about engagement rings. It has been heart shattering for her. Bella really thought this was going to be her happily ever after.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment. 

During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both women he was falling in love with - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day her saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock.'

As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.'

She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'

After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena, telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her.

'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the 31-year-old nurse.

'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'

Locky teased another blindside when he admitted to Irena that he'd had his doubts about their relationship.

'However, my biggest fear is that you're not going to be able to put yourself first, or tell me no. And in my partner, I want drive and ambition,' he said. 

'And I think you've got that in spades,' he added, much to Irena's relief.

'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true. 

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

'I love you too!' she replied, as swelling music and a sweeping camera shot marked the dramatic end of Locky's journey to find love.

The couple are still happily together two months after filming the finale, and Irena has packed up her life in Melbourne to live with Locky in Perth.
