Rebecca Gormley has put on a smouldering display in her latest lingerie shoot after defending herself over claims she was 'blackfishing' by wearing braids.

The Love Island star, 20, showcased her sizzling figure in the triangle-style bra with pretty lace detailing, which she teamed with a pair of equally skimpy bottoms.

Rebecca's barely-there underwear highlighted her ample assets and toned abs as she posed up a storm for the new shoot.

She proudly showcased her new hairstyle in a picture with her boyfriend Biggs Chris, however she was quickly accused of cultural appropriation.

Fans were left unimpressed that she was sporting a hairstyle typically worn by black women, and took to the comments section to express their disapproval.

Having her say: Rebecca defended herself after she was criticised for styling her hair in braids, which some of her followers claimed was 'black fishing'

Blackfishing is a term used when someone adopts makeup or hair stylings to appear like they have black heritage.

One person wrote underneath a picture of her sporting the braids: 'Hunny cultural appropriation looks so good on you must be why you continue to do it #pleasestop.'

While another said: 'Girl you can't wear that hairstyle...'

Another said: 'I'd rethink the hair.'

However some of her followers supported her decision, with one writing: 'I don't understand the hate. If she appreciates the beauty of your culture and supports it, why are y'all so mad?' 

After noticing the comments and receiving some private messages about her style choice, Rebecca took to her Stories to defend the choice.

She said: 'So I've been going through my requests and I've got loads of awful messages which I don't think is fair at all. 

'I've had messages saying I'm being disrespectful to people's culture because of my hair but I wear braids all the time, just because I've got a few more braids downs meant I'm being disrespectful.'





Unimpressed: Fans were left unimpressed that she was sporting a hairstyle typically worn by black women, and took to the comments section to express their disapproval

'I don't want to hurt anyone I'm just being myself, I'm doing me. I'm literally just doing me. I had to get someone else to do it, because I can't do it as good as this. Have you seen it they're unreal.

'Also thank you to everyone who has been sending me lovely messages and being so kind, I really appreciate it and I love you all.'

Her beau Biggs then chimed in, and said: 'Just a quick one guys, I'm sorry, basically my point is if a young white boy came to me and said Biggs I like your hair and I want that. I should be happy because I've got something he wants. He's appreciating the culture. I'd be worried if he said urgh I don't want that. It's 2020, it's different.'

Support: However some of her followers supported her decision, with one writing: 'I don't understand the hate. If she appreciates the beauty of your culture and supports it, why are y'all so mad?'

Confused: After noticing the comments and receiving some private messages about her style choice, Rebecca took to her Stories to defend the choice

Rebecca said: 'I think it's nice if you want to embrace other's culture.'

It comes a couple of weeks after Rebecca was accused of cultural appropriation when she took part in a Native American themed photo shoot.

She posted a series of photos on her Instagram showing her in the costume and posing alongside a horse.

In the pictures, Rebecca sported a fringe coat, headdress with feathers, traditional Native American jewellery and holding a long totem pole.

Discussing the shoot, Rebecca added: 'Coming to the photo shoot that I did with the horse, I apologise if anyone felt any upset or hurt, I didn't want to hurt with anyone, it was just generally a photo shoot. I do modelling that's what I do, I didn't mean to intentionally hurt anyone.'
