Nick Kyrgios wasted no time at all in taking to social media to make his opinion known following Novak Djokovic's horror show at the US Open.

Djokovic shocked the tennis world after a moment of madness saw him swipe at a ball in anger and hit a line-judge directly in the throat.

Djokovic, the overwhelming favourite to win the slam at Flushing Meadows, has been automatically disqualified as a result.

It comes as the latest in a long string of controversies from Djokovic, and Kyrgios couldn't help but be critical of the Serbian once again.

Creating a poll via Twitter, Kyrgios wrote: 'Swap me for jokers incident. ‘Accidentally hitting the ball kid in the throat’ how many years would I be banned for?' 

He then gave fans the option to vote between three options of five years, ten years or a 20 year ban.

The Australian made a major hint at favouritism within the sport, while he is often portrayed as the bad boy of tennis for much less severe incidents.

The Serbian star trudged off, exiting the US Open despite being the overwhelming favourite 

A majority percentage of fans voted for '20 years' on Kyrgios's poll, seemingly agreeing with the 25-year-old that tennis governing bodies come down much harder when he is in the spotlight.

Djokovic, 33, had already been showing signs of frustration at the resistance being put up by Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta when he was broken for 5-6 in the opening set.

After Djokovic saw red and struck the line-judge, referee Soeren Friemel was summoned onto court inside the deserted Arthur Ashe Stadium by umpire Aurelie Tourte. Djokovic was then told, after plenty of debate, that there was no option and he had to go.

Djokovic could then be heard pleading for leniency, protesting: 'She doesn’t have to go to the hospital for this.

'You’re going to choose a default in this situation? My career, Grand Slam, centre stage?'

In recent months Kyrgios has been more outspoken than ever before, appearing to be a voice of reason amid the madness of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Tweeting a video of players from the Adria Tour event partying in a nightclub, Kyrgios said the decision to play amid the pandemic made his previous indiscretions pale by comparison 

Kyrgios had warned about the,'MQA dangers of the virus and the need to keep adhering to social distancing, before publicly slamming Djokovic after the world No.1 made the poor judgement of arranging his 'Adria Tour.' 

Several personnel ended up contracting coronavirus, including Djokovic himself who later tested positive.

Alongside a video of some of the players partying in a nightclub, Kyrgios had wrote on Twitter: 'Prayers up to all the players that have contracted Covid-19. Don't @ me for anything I've done that has been 'irresponsible' or classified as 'stupidity' - this takes the cake.'

Later, after Croatian player Borna Coric announced he'd tested positive, Kyrgios wrote: 'Boneheaded decision to go ahead with the 'exhibition'. Speedy recovery fellas, but that's what happens when you disregard all protocols. This IS NOT A JOKE.'
