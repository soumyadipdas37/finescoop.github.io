Heston Blumenthal has delighted foodies by introducing a new gin to his Waitrose range, which he suggests serving with olive oil.

The Lazy Sunshine Gin costs £25 for a 70cl bottle and will be available in Waitrose from September 4.

The spirit, inspired by the London-born chef's fondness of the south of France, is infused with Mediterranean sweet basil, rosemary, thyme and lavender botanicals, served the 'lazy' way with tonic and ice.

But if you want to serve it in the style of Heston, the chef suggests adding a Nocellara Olive and a drizzle of No.1 Chianti Olive Oil. 

Heston Blumenthal has delighted foodies by introducing a new gin to the his Waitrose range and it has an unusual serving suggestion - olive oil. The Lazy Sunshine Gin costs £25 for a 70cl bottle and will be available in Waitrose from September 

Heston, 54, said: 'Open this bottle and what do you smell? Basil, rosemary, thyme, lavender and Juniper. 

'For me, those aromas are Provence in a glass – the place that first inspired me to be a chef. And how will I be drinking it in the lazy sunshine? With the addition of a little olive oil to give it body and intensity.'

The 54-year-old two-Michelin star chef is renowned for creating outlandish and unusual dishes

John Vine, Waitrose spirits buyer added: 'This gin is exceptional - delicious and aromatic on its own, but also amazing with a drizzle of good quality olive oil over the top is a perfect match. 

'On the nose, the fragrant juniper comes through and balances perfectly with the subtle notes of lavender. When you taste the gin, the fresh juniper and savoury herbal notes blend together beautifully. 

'The finish is dry like a classic gin but with floral and herbal notes. The olive oil brings out all of these flavours, making it a show-stopping cocktail to have as an aperitif, while enjoying the late summer sunshine in the garden.'









Fans have already shared their excitement about the new product, taking to Twitter and Instagram to say they will rush out to buy some.
