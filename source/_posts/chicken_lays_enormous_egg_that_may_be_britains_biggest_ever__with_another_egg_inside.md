A chicken has laid an enormous egg that could be Britain's biggest ever - and even had another egg inside.

Debbie James, from Bridgend, South Wales, bought chickens during lockdown and one had laid a huge egg.

The nine-month-old chicken, named Jax, tends to lay larger eggs than the rest but they think this one may be the largest in the UK.   

Debbie James, from Bridgend, South Wales, bought chickens during lockdown and one had laid a huge egg almost four inches tall 

The egg measured over eight inches in circumference and was almost four inches tall. 

When the egg was cracked open there was even another one inside, making it extra special. 

Jax eats a lot of vegetables and loves cabbage, as well as eating her normal food.

The previous biggest in the UK was believed to be nearly eight inches in circumference and weighed 200 grams.   

Ms James used the egg to make custard and meringue as she wanted to do 'something special' with it.

Although she said it 'tasted just the same as normal' it still felt special due to the large size of the egg.
