Car makers across the UK and the EU are urging politicians to secure a Brexit trade deal to avoid 'catastrophic' losses. 

Tariffs would threaten the production of 3m EU- and UK-built cars and vans over the next five years. 

This would mean losses of up to £84billion for the European automotive sector, and threaten thousands of jobs. 

Warning: Tariffs would threaten the production of 3m EU- and UK-built cars and vans over the next five years

Speaking for the whole industry, Mike Hawes, of the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'These figures paint a bleak picture of the devastation that would follow a No Deal. 

'The shock of tariffs and other trade barriers would compound the damage already dealt by a global pandemic and recession, putting businesses at risk.'
