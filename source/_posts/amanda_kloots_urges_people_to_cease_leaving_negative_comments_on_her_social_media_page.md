'I say no to that and I turned off the commenting thing,' said Kloots, who is mother to son Elvis Eduardo, one, with the late Tony-nominee.

While she didn't get specific about what the negative was about - her last post featured her and Elvis wearing blue caps - the Ohio-born star told her followers that no matter who they support politically, they should get out and vote this November.

'I support voting, I want everyone to go vote I want you to vote however you want to vote, just go vote,' she said.

Kloots said that the color of her hat in no way pointed toward any political direction (as President Donald Trump's campaigns have been synonymous with a red ball cap reading 'Make America Great Again').
