A fox has been found drowned in a lake after it got its head stuck in a crisp packet and fell in a lake.

Grisly pictures of the wild animal lying on its side in the water have been shared online as a warning against littering.

The body  was discovered at a lake in Apex Leisure and Wildlife Park in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. 

The lake is often visited by fishermen and children visiting ducks.

The shocking pictures of the fox were taken at a lake in Apex Leisure and Wildlife Park, Somerset, on Thursday

Sharing the images on Facebook, Somerset Against Animal Persecution wrote: 'Please put your litter in the bin.

This poor fox got his head stuck in a crisp packet and fell into the water at the Apex.'

The photos angered many social media users.

Cheryl Hingley wrote: 'This is so sad and so unnecessary what an awful death for this poor animal. I'm so sorry poor fox.'

Carolyn Leigh added: 'This angers me so much and foxes are excellent swimmers too. So sad and unnecessary.'

And Helen Brumby said: 'So much rubbish everywhere! Such terrible consequences.'

Speaking today, a spokeswoman for Somerset Against Animal Persecution who found the fox said: 'My dog sniffed it out and I burst into tears when I saw it, I was so upset.

Environmental campaigners shared the shocking pictures online as a warning to the public not to litter

'I'm a conservation psychologist and I watched David Attenborough's Extinction documentary the other day and it just made me really depressed. 

'There is a lot of litter at the Apex because it's so popular

'You see all these photos of turtles and seagulls caught in plastic, but you don't really expect to see it in your local area.

'The consequences of littering for wildlife are huge, absolutely massive.'
