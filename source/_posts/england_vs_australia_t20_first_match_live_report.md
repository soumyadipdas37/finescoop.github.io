England will be left less than satisfied with their T20 innings as they allowed Australia to claw back their way back into a match which threatened to be running away from them.

The hosts started brilliantly through Jos Buttler who opened with 44 runs from just 29 deliveries. However, England began to wobble in the middle part of the innings as Australia's bowling attack dug deep.

Dawid Malan was the backbone for England's innings with a devastating knock of 66 but Australia will feel that they can surpass the 162-7 they reduced England to come the end of 20 overs.
