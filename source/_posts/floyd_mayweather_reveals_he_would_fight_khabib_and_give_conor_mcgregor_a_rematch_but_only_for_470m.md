Floyd Mayweather has revealed he would be open to fighting Conor McGregor or Khabib Nurmagomedov, but only for an eye-watering $600million (£470m).

The retired boxing legend has no intentions of returning to the ring to take on today's elite fighters like Terence Crawford or Canelo Alvarez - even if he was given a $150m (£115m) pay day - but would lace up the gloves again for a money-spinning crossover fight.

Ever since Mayweather's 10th-round stoppage victory over UFC star McGregor back in 2017, there has been much talk of a rematch or a possible bout with another MMA fighter.

UFC champion Khabib has been heavily mentioned and reportedly turned down a $100m (£78m) offer to face Mayweather in Saudi Arabia back in August.

Mayweather, however, has admitted he is keen to fight either Khabib or McGregor in the near future.

Speaking on ‘Club Shay Shay’ podcast, Mayweather said: ‘Conor McGregor can’t punch. He can’t punch. I was having fun. I was like, "Ah this dude's punches are so soft", it’s cool. I didn’t take no punches, I still got my faculties.

'$150m (£115m)? to fight any boxer? It's not enough, absolutely not. My health is more important.

Retired boxing legend said he would fight UFC's Khabib Nurmagomedov for $300m (£235m)

‘Why would I go out there and fight these young fighters – these young lions – and risk my health? But as far as me going out there competing against guys like Conor McGregor, or someone who is really inexperienced, oh absolutely.'

Asked specifically if he would fight Khabib, the 43-year-old added: 'Oh absolutely. Those are $300m (£235m) fights. You have to make it make sense, real sense. 

'I still have to have my faculties and be able to have my senses and hang out with my kids and still make smart investments. All those types of things are very important and play a major, major part in my life. 

'Some people are saying: "Oh you need to fight this guy, you need to fight this guy". Listen, it's called eras for a reason, I had my time, I had my era, it's these young guys' era now. 

Mayweather said he would not be risking his health by fighting a McGregor or a Khabib

The 43-year-old said that McGregor 'couldn't punch' and that his shots were 'soft' 

UFC champ Khabib reportedly rejected $100m (£78m)  to face Mayweather in Saudi Arabia

'But it's OK for me to fight a Khabib or a McGregor, with those two fights alone I can pick up $600m so that don't hurt. A fight that just entertains. That's all entertaining.' 

Mayweather also said that he and UFC president Dana White will be doing some 'big business' together at the end of this year or next year, which will only fuel speculation of a possible fight with either McGregor or Khabib. 

Retired UFC star McGregor is set to step back into the boxing ring again against Mayweather's former foe Manny Pacquiao in the Middle East next year.

Both McGregor and Pacquiao have a gentlemen's agreement to face each other but some of the finer details still need to be ironed out before the fight can be confirmed.
