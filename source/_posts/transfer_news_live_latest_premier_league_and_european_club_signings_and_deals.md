The transfer window has well and truly burst into life, with deals coming thick and fast as clubs look to bolster their squads ahead of the new season - which is just over a week away. 

Clubs have until October 5 to wrap up their business but complications caused by the worldwide chaos mean they'll be keen to get their signings in sooner rather than later.

There are plenty of big deals yet to be sealed with Manchester United fans hoping to see Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek arrive at Old Trafford soon, while Lionel Messi's possible move to Man City looks to go to the wire.   

Sportsmail's OLI GAMP will provide live updates of the latest signings, loans and negotiations from Premier League and European clubs during the day.

Hello and welcome to another exciting day in the transfer window. 

Things are really hotting up now with major deals being announced every day. Yesterday Arsenal finally confirmed defender Gabriel Magalhaes after a transfer saga that was dragging on all summer, while Barcelona's clearout began with midfielder Ivan Rakitic leaving for former club Sevilla. 

There is also the small matter of Lionel Messi's future to deal with as his representatives start crunch talks with the Spanish giants over a mega move this summer. It promises to be an eventful day in store.
