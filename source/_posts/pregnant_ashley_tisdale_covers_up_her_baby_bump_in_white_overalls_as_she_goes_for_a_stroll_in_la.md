Pregnant Ashley Tisdale stepped out on Sunday with her husband of six years, musician Chris French, for a caffeine fix and a light stroll. 

The High School Musical star, 35, who just announced her pregnancy about a week ago, seemed to be savoring her weekend as she and Chris, 38, enjoyed a family outing. 

Concealing her baby bump in a pair of white overalls, the actress put on a stylish display for their lowkey day.

 The mom-to-be had her two dogs, Sushi and Ziggy, in tow as she walked out with an iced beverage from the Coffee Bean. 

The blonde rocked a pair of black Chanel dad sandals, that coordinated with her black t-shirt under the overalls. 

She hid her short blonde locks under a grey beanie, accessorizing her look with round sunglasses and a green bandana tied around her neck. 

Taking her grey face mask off to take a sip of her beverage, the actress made sure nobody was around as she guided her two small pups.

Chris played up the edge with his look, wearing a ripped black t-shirt and a pair of black sweat shorts that were embroidered with a skull and crossbones. 

He kept his dark locks gelled and rocked a pair of rayban sunglasses, as he stepped out with white sneakers and a face mask on their neighborhood stroll. 

The pair traded off taking ownership over their pooches, as they chatted and relished in each other's company. 

Later in the day Ashley posted a photo of herself from bed as she said it was 'time to relax.'

The Frenshe founder recently took to her wellness blog to discuss her first trimester of pregnancy, after announcing her baby news in a post titled 'Surprise, I’m Pregnant!' 

'It hasn’t been an easy first trimester, but everyone is different and I know there are people who’ve had it way worse' she said. 

'I definitely fall somewhere in the middle where I didn’t just have nausea, but threw up a couple of times and felt like I’ve had stomach flu for three months' she continued.

 The Suite Life actress also shared that she felt pressure after getting married to have children, adding that she was not in the right headspace at the time. 

 'To be honest, it just felt invasive' she shared. 'I wasn’t ready for that step yet and I wanted to be selfish and have Chris all to myself for a while.'

Last week, Ashley continued to get candid about her life on her blog as she talked about having her breast implants removed. 

 The actress wrote that she had been suffering some health problems and decided to get an explant surgery after reading about it online.

'I just knew that taking them out was already going to relieve some of the symptoms I was struggling with' she shared. 

Discussing her journey of living with her body after surgery, Ashley revealed a level of self-love she had not previously had. 

'Seeing my body in a way I hadn’t seen it in a while and fully loving the way I looked is a feeling I’ll never forget' she wrote. 

She also credits her husband Chris with helping to make her feel beautiful in her own skin.

'My husband always helps me look at the positive and says that those scars represent my journey and what got me to where I am right now...I embrace those imperfections, and I embrace that I’m not perfect and that I’m beautiful just as I am' she wrote. 

The couple first met in 2012 through mutual friends after it was revealed that Ashley, who also sings, had a thing for 'rocker types'. Talking to On Air With Ryan Seacrest in 2013, she revealed it was love at first sight. 

'I was like, OK, this is the guy, and he knew the same thing. It doesn't get any better. I just can't explain it,' she gushed. 

Ashley's most recent film Phineas and Ferb The Movie is currently streaming on Disney+. The actress reprised her role as Candace in the animated film version of the television show, for the first time in five years.
