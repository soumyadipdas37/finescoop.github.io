Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has dismissed the idea of defending their Premier League title - insisting his side will 'attack it with all we have'.

The Reds cruised to their first league crown in 30 years last season in a near-faultless season that saw them triumph by an 18-point margin over closest rivals Manchester City, but the German's squad will have to push the reset button as they prepare to become the fourth side to retain the trophy.

The champions, who play Leeds United at Anfield in their season opener on Saturday, will face renewed pressure from Chelsea, who have invested heavily in the market, while Manchester City are always a threat, but Klopp said his side would be aggressive in their quest for more success. 

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insists his players will 'attack' and not defend the league title 

'Somebody told me we have to defend the title and I don't understand that,' he said in his pre-match press conference. 'Maybe I'm not smart enough but if theres a title out there we showed last year that we were able to go for it. 

'We did it the year before also. That doesn't mean we will this year, because we don't take things for granted. But the titles out there - we attack them. We are all in the same position, zeo games, zero points - let's go for it. 

'That's how I understand it and that's how I always understood it, so why should we change it now just because we won [the title]?'

The Reds were runaway winners as they cruised to the league crown with an 18-point margin

Klopp said his players would 'go again with all we have' as they prepare for another campaign

Klopp made the comparison to Liverpool's Champions League knockout defeat to Atletico Madrid last season and how the team bounced back from that disappointment to win the league.  

'We went out of the Champions League last year because we faced a really good opponent and we were unlucky in the game,' he added.

It was not about performance, it was not about desire, it was about football because it can happen - especially against these strong opponents, so we will go again.'

There will be a handful of changes this season as football continues to adapt to the ongoing coronavirus situation, but Liverpool will not longer benefit from using five substitutions as the Premier League voted to revert back to three. 

He is concerned about player welfare after the Premier League reverted to three substitutions

Klopp feels the change will give his side a 'difficult' challenge this season and believes it could put players at greater risk of injury. 

'The biggest challenge is about pressing a normal season into a shorter period,' he continued. 'It's a proper challenge, Especially with the three [subs].

'This is only about player welfare by the way. I'm not sure why we have to discuss this. It will be difficult.

'I thought from a common sense point of view, of course it would be clear we will have 20 [in the matchday squad] and five [subs]. It's about players' welfare and highest quality in games for all teams.

'Now it is 18 [in the matchday squad] and three [subs can come on], so you have to rotate more, you need numbers and fit players. That is the job we have to do. We have make the decisions.'
