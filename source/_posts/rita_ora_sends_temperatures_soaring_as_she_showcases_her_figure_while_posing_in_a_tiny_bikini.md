She is back in the UK after spending much of the summer soaking up the sun in Greece and Ibiza.

And Rita Ora was feeling nostalgic as she shared a video of herself striking a series of poses while on a yacht during her trip. 

The singer, 29, looked incredible in the clip as she displayed her jaw-dropping figure in a tiny orange and black bikini.

Showcasing her washboard abs and sun-kissed glow, the hitmaker fixed the camera with a sultry stare.

Rita let her honey blonde locks fall loose while she completed her look with several gold necklaces.

The How To Be Lonely singer captioned the video: 'Summers basically over anyways here’s a memory I found ☺️'. 

Rita had set pulses racing when she first slipped into the tiger print string bikini for an array of scantily-clad snaps last month.

She captioned the montage: 'Little diary of my day yesterday. Tag your best friend that takes photos when they think you’re asleep lol.' 

Before Greece, Rita had a holiday in Ibiza with her friends and new beau Romain Gavras. 

The singer has been inducing envy with her picturesque bikini snaps shared from the Ultima Corfu villa. 

Her  clifftop holiday home in Corfu is certainly fit for a superstar, boasting seven suites, a two-level infinity pool and its own 78ft private yacht.

Despite jetting to Greece, Rita still faces 14 days of quarantine when she returns to the UK after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Rita and her Greek-French director beau Romain, 39, were first seen together in July after a night of partying.

Speaking to The Sun, friends insisted Rita was involved with the filmmaker after she was seen enjoying a boozy evening out with business tycoon Faton Gashi.

A source said: 'Rita was hitting the town with friends including Faton. But she's in a serious thing with Romain and properly loved up. It's the first time she's been serious with someone in ages.'

Rita's previous boyfriends include Calvin Harris, Andrew Garfield, Rob Kardashian, musician Andrew Watt and Ricky Hil - the son of fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger.

The media personality has spent lockdown working on new music while also enjoying time with her friends in the countryside.
