The mayor of Rochester, New York, has requested a federal investigation into the death of Daniel Prude, a black man who was suffocated by police officers in the street back in March. 

Mayor Lovely Warren disclosed her request for a federal probe on Monday and ordered Rochester Police Chief La'Ron Singletary to step down immediately, according to News8.  

The announcements came after Rochester endured more than a week of protests over the death of 41-year-old Prude, who died several days after being restrained by police March 23. 

This is a developing story.
