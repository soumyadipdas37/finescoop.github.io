Rachel Riley got caught in a sudden downpour as she left the Countdown studios in Manchester after filming on Wednesday. 

The presenter, 34, looked every inch the doting mum as she carried her daughter Maven, nine months, in a leopard print sling. 

Rachel was joined by her husband Pasha Kovalev, 40, who carried two large suitcases as they left the ITV studios.

Rachel cut a stylish figure in black jeans and a neon pink cardigan. 

She opted for comfort on her feet with white trainers and wore her blonde in a sleek straight do. 

The television presenter certainly had her hands full as she carried baby Maven in the sling while pushing a pram and small suitcase.

The family outing comes as Rachel revealed her hopes for baby daughter Maven, nine months, to be bilingual as husband Pasha Kovalev only talks to her 'solely in Russian'.

The Countdown star appeared Good Morning Britain recently where she sweetly spoke about her family.

Discussing baby daughter Maven, she said: 'She's got teeth, she's biting us, she's all about chat chat chat!

'Pasha is speaking to her solely in Russian and I'm speaking to her in English so we're hoping she'll be bilingual.' 

Rachel sweetly added: 'She's so mobile, she's crawling and can walk with one hand now.'  

The maths whizz also shared that she will be teaching her daughter mathematics but joked: 'At the moment, she can bash cups together!'

Rachel also shared details of the regulations on set for Countdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.  

She said: 'We were quite lucky, but we lost our audience which is a shame as they come time and time again, we're like a little family.

'The person who comes and takes the letters from me is in full hazmat gear and has a spatula!' 

Rachel, Pasha and Maven have spent lockdown with her Russian mother-in-law Galina, whose month-long visit to the UK was extended amid the pandemic.   

The couple, who became first-time parents to Maven in December and met on Strictly Come Dancing, have enjoyed extended time off at home amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.
