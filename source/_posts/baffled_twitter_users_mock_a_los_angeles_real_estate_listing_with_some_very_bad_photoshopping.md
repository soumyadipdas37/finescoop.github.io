A Los Angeles real estate listing is going viral thanks to some truly terrible Photoshopping.

The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom home in the neighborhood of Atwater Village seems like a great rental — so it's unclear why the agent who listed it got carried away in a photo-editing app.

Images show a flower pot, stools, and a sofa that quite clearly don't belong, and appear to have been inexpertly copied and pasted into the photos for reasons unknown.

Where'd that couch come from? A Los Angeles real estate listing is going viral thanks to some truly terrible Photoshopping

So strange! A photo in the kitchen shows a flower pot awkwardly edited onto the kitchen island, as well as two three-legged stools edited onto one side

Take two! The flower pot makes an appearance in another photo

The photos for 4020 Brunswick Ave. are mostly normal, showing the outside of the home, the kitchen, the bathroom, and the two bedrooms.

But three of the photos are inexplicably edited — and badly.

The first shows a flower pot awkwardly edited onto the kitchen island, as well as two three-legged stools edited onto one side.

The editing is so messy that a jagged line of background is visible around the legs of the stools.

Looks OK! The rest of the photos in the listing are totally normal

'Eat at the island looking into kitchen,' reads the caption, providing no explanation for the bizarre photo editing. 

Another angle of the kitchen also has the flower pot — edited onto a different part of the island — but no stools.

Meanwhile, a photo of one the bedrooms shows an almost entirely empty room, save for a gray loveseat that has been hastily edited in.

The sofa, too, has jagged lines where the copy-and-paste process was done in a hurry.

While the details for the listing include quite a bit of information about the home and the surrounding area, the person who shared it — whose name is listed it Brad Balduff — did not provide any explanation about the Photoshopping.

The listing appears to have flown under the radar until Twitter user Caitie Delaney shared screengrabs on the social media platform.

Funny: Her tweet has been liked over 50,000 times, with commenters chiming in with their own retorts and edits

'Losing my f***ing mind at these apartment listing photos,' she wrote.

Her tweet has been liked over 50,000 times, with commenters chiming in with their own retorts and edits. 

'This is the greatest thing I've ever seen,' wrote one.

'That couch is gonna scuttle away like a land crab,' wrote another. 

'So we going to just ignore the fact that the couch is clearly a vampire? I’ll assume it’s named Nosofaratu...' wrote one, noting the fact that the edited-in couch has no reflection in the mirror behind it.  

Another joked that the pictures have 'strong Blues Clues vibes.'
