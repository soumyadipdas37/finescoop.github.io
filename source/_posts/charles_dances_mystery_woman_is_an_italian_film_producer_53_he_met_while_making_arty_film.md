He's not lost the matinee idol looks which propelled him to stardom in The Jewel In The Crown 36 years ago.

Fit and trim at 73 thanks to an exercise regime which includes regular outdoor dips at a Hampstead lido, Charles Dance told an interviewer: ‘I feel 35. I probably act 25.’

Certainly, after a long marriage to sculptress Joanna Haythorn which ended in 2004, he has embarked on an eventful latelife bachelorhood.

Sweet: Charles Dance, 73, shared a sweet kiss with a younger female companion, as he enjoyed a day at the beach in Venice on Thursday

Impressive: The Game Of Thrones star showcased his impressive shirtless physique as he enjoyed a day at the beach

There have been a string of lovers all at least two decades his junior – and he was canoodling with a new one in Venice this week.

The bikini-clad blonde is believed to be Alessandra Masi, 53, an Italian film producer. They met in 2018 when he acted in art movie The Book Of Vision, which opened at the Venice film festival on Thursday. Miss Masi was the unit production manager and the film was principally shot in Italy.

Perhaps significantly, she has been hired to work on his next film The Inn At The Edge of the World, an adaptation of the Alice Thomas Ellis book about an unrelated group who answer an advert and go to a remote Scottish island to escape Christmas.

Dance will direct as well as star in that film, alongside Joanna Lumley and Freddie Fox.

Gorgeous: Charles proudly displayed his youthful physique as he went shirtless for a swim in the ocean with his female companion

Lovely: He was soon joined by his female companion, who opted for a pale pink bikini with a black stripe

A friend of his confirmed that he had recently mentioned a ‘new Italian girlfriend’, although there was no response from his agents yesterday.

Miss Masi, who comes from Bologna, has a degree in film from Bologna University and has been working in the movies for nearly three decades.

In an interview last year Dance – who plays Lord Mountbatten in The Crown – said the end of his marriage had been a matter of great sadness. ‘I regret that the marriage ended; it was largely my fault. But sensibly, we’re now the best of friends,’ he said.

Relaxed: The pair certainly seemed to be enjoying the warm Italian sunshine as they soaked up the September weather

Cosy: The pair moved in for a sweet kiss as they enjoyed the cool water in each other's arms

He told another interviewer that he had not been ‘the greatest husband in the world’ to Jo, whom he met when he was 19.

Before their split was announced he was linked to actress Emilia Fox. Then came a relationship with actress Sophia Myles, 33 years his junior; they dated from 2003 to 2005.

Next he dated model Shambhala Marthe, 26 years his junior, whom he met in a fruit and veg market. She was succeeded in his affections by painter Eleanor Boorman, by whom he had a daughter, Rose, when he was 65.

Miss Boorman is 25 years his junior and they split in 2012 soon after the baby arrived.

He told an interviewer in 2019 that he likes ‘beautiful women’ and added: ‘I like independence, I like strong women, women who survive and thrive in what is still a male-dominated world in most professions. I think that description fits my ex-wife and my former fiancee, Eleanor.’

Screen star: Charles starred as Tywin Lannister in the first four series of Game of Thrones, before his character was killed off

Former flames: He was married to Joanna Haythorn from 1970 to 2004, and they have two grown-up children

Exes: He then dated actress Sophia Myles, then in her 20s, who has starred in films including Thunderbirds, but they split in 2005

History: Charles was also linked to French-born ex-Gucci model Shambhala Marthe, and then dated artist Eleanor Boorman for four years

Over: Despite welcoming baby daughter Rose together in 2012 and even getting engaged, the couple split months later

Divisive: Following Game of Thrones' disappointing final season, Charles revealed last month that he hopes bosses may remake its concluding run

Controversial: He weighed in on his former series in an interview with PopCulture.com , admitting he hadn't heard of the petition launched by upset fans, but said he 'would sign it'

Romantic: Charles moved in for a kiss with his younger female companion as they enjoyed a swim together in the ocean 

What's going on? Charles is in Italy for the rescheduled Venice Film Festival, and to promote his role in the film The Book of Vision
