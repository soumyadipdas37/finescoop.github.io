 China has called on importers to shun frozen food from countries suffering from severe coronavirus outbreaks after several cases of imported seafood products testing positive for the virus.

'Customs and local governments have repeatedly detected the coronavirus in imported cold chain food, proving it risks contamination,' the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau said on Monday in a statement issued to import companies.

The bureau urged them to closely monitor the overseas pandemic situation and 'proactively avoid importing cold chain food from areas heavily hit by the coronavirus' and make alternative plans for imports.

China had reported no local infections of the coronavirus for more than a month but recently detected it on the packaging of imported aquatic products in Jilin province and Qingdao city.

Last week, Qingdao, a major port city in east China, scrambled to quarantine over 300 residents after two handlers working for a seafood importer tested positive for the coronavirus, sparking fears of a looming new COVID-19 outbreak in the country.  

China has stepped up checks on frozen food imports, despite the World Health Organization had said it saw no evidence of COVID-19 being spread by food or packaging. 

It has previously banned imports of products including frozen meat, Ecuadorian shrimps and Brazilian chicken wings following positive tests.

Fears have arisen that contaminated food shipments could cause new outbreaks in the country as officials have warned the public about the infection risks from imported meat and seafood. The file photo shows people shopping at a wet market in Hong Kong on September 26

Fears have also arisen that contaminated food shipments could cause new outbreaks in the country as officials have warned the public about the infection risks from imported meat and seafood. 

As of September 7, China had suspended imports from dozens of food companies across at least 19 countries and regions where workers have been infected with the contagion, according to state media. 

The first cluster of COVID-19 cases was linked to the Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan.

Initial studies suggested the virus originated in animal products on sale at the  sprawling food market. 

Heavy traces of the virus were found in the meat and seafood sections of a market in the capital Beijing that was the site of an outbreak in June. 

Li Fengqin, who heads a microbiology lab at the China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment told reporters in June the possibility of contaminated frozen food causing new infections could not be ruled out.
