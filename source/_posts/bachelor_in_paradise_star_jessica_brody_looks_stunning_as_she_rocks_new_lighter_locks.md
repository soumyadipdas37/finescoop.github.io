She's the Bachelor In Paradise star known for her stunning physique and breathtaking beauty.

And on Wednesday, Jessica Brody, 30, decided to switch things up and unveil her latest look on Instagram.

In her post, the reality TV star looked completely unrecognisable as she swapped her brunette tresses for what appeared to be a long blonde wig. 

Blonde ambition! On Wednesday, Bachelor In Paradise star Jessica Brody looked stunning as she rocked her new lighter locks in a beige bucket hat 

 

The stunner showed off her figure in a cream coloured crop top and jeans and accessorised with a beige bucket hat.  

Jess looked glamorous with a full coverage foundation, a smokey eye and defined brows to complement her new look. 

'On my way to the bottle store for the 7th time this week pretending I don’t know the brunette girl with all the tattoos who came in yesterday,' she wrote under the post.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Jessica for comment.

Jess' transformation comes just days after she flaunted her incredible figure in a racy Instagram post.

The blonde bombshell wowed in nothing more than a skimpy white lace lingerie set as she posed for a series of provocative images.

'If you can guess that amount of my most recent heating bill (two months) I will pin your comment. Honestly going to have to start wearing clothes because I’m gonna go broke,' she captioned the first image.

She later added: 'I’ll diversify my content soon, I promise.' 

Jess enjoyed a short-lived fling with Ciarran Stott, 26, on this year's season of Bachelor In Paradise, but their relationship quickly soured.

'As soon as Kiki [Morris] walked in, Ciarran wanted nothing to do with me. And now I feel like I've lost my chance at something real in Paradise,' she said on the show.
