Ronald Koeman expects 17-year-old starlet Ansu Fati to play an important role in Barcelona's first team this season.

The teenager has already established himself as a star, becoming the youngest ever Champions League goalscorer and the youngest ever Barcelona goalscorer.

However, the new Catalans boss has called for 'calm' over the youngsters development as he insists the striker still needs to improve aspects of his game despite being set for a star studded career.

Having helped Barcelona put their torturous summer behind them by providing two goals in 18 minutes in their 4-0 thrashing of Villarreal, Koeman spoke fondly of Fati in the post-match conference. 

'Ansu is a young player, and we are still seeking consistency in his performances,' the Dutch manager said. 

'He has a great future and I am happy with his performance against Villarreal.

'His progress has been enormous, and we have benefited from that. He keeps proving his worth and we are confident he will keeping developing.'

Fati will take Barcelona's number 22 shirt this season and look to help the club bring the La Liga crown back to Catalunya once again.

Following Diego Costa and Luis Suarez's exit to Atletico Madrid, Fati will be handed more regular first-team opportunities under Koeman this year.

The youngster is likely to rotate with Ousmane Dembele as he looks to develop a partnership with Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann.

Barcelona have previously been criticised for their reluctance to give the youngster generation a chance but Fati is one of a select few to handed an opportunity. 

The youngster is, however, yet to sign a first-team deal with the club. 

As it stands, the 17-year-old is contracted with the Catalans until June 30, 2022 and has a release clause worth £153million.

That clause will be increased to £363m when he signs a professional contract with the club.  

Koeman’s side now face back to back La Liga games ahead of the October international break with a midweek trip to Celta Vigo and a home game against Sevilla.
