She teamed this with skinny jeans which displayed her trim legs and white trainers.

Jenni wore her blonde bob sleek and straight with a rich palette of make-up enhancing her pretty features. 

The star added a final elegant touch with a teal handbag. 

Earlier this month the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon.

She said: 'A few weeks ago I sustained a stress fracture on my 3rd metatarsal. Frustratingly it’s very hard to spot on an X-ray and so it took quite a while to diagnose.

'Anyway, it happened six weeks ago and thankfully it is repairing well so I have to wear a support boot whilst I’m walking around to limit further damage until it fully mends.

'It was a consequence of excessive running in lockdown whilst preparing for the virtual London marathon. 

'Sadly it means I can no longer run on October 4th but should be back running home from work in a month!'

Away from radio, it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.

The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.

Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers.
