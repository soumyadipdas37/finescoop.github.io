Lily Allen has revealed she's returned to the UK after jetting to Las Vegas to tie the knot with Stranger Things' David Harbour.

The singer, 35, took to Instagram Stories to reveal she's begun her two-week quarantine after marrying the actor at the Graceland Wedding Chapel last week.

It appears that Lily has headed back to the UK alone, as just a day earlier her new husband David was spotted out and about in New York City.

Lily posted a snap of her new office with the caption 'Quarantine Studio,' as she begun her 14 days in isolation.

Currently COVID-19 guidelines state that any UK resident returning from the United States must isolate for two weeks due to the country's high number of cases.  

After flying home it also appeared Lily had indulged in a cosy new winter coat as she posted an array of snaps of the new garment.

Meanwhile Lily's new husband David was spotted out and about in NYC on Tuesday,  despite current COVID-19 regulations that require anyone returning from Nevada to New York to quarantine for 14 days.  

As of September 9, Nevada is listed as a restricted state on the New York government website, with the only exemption being someone who was passing through a restricted state and spent less than 24 hours there. 

DailyMail.com contacted Harbour's representative for comment at the time.

David and Lily tied the knot in Las Vegas on Monday, September 7, officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator.

They divide their time between the UK and the US and sparked engagement rumours in May when Allen was seen with a sparkler on her ring finger in an Instagram post.

In snaps shared from the ceremony, Allen exchanged vows wearing a short 60s-inspired Dior dress with bateau neckline and veil.

The newlyweds celebrated their nuptials with burgers and fries from fast food chain In-N-Out.  

Sharing photos to his Instagram last week, Harbour wrote: 'In a wedding officiated by the king himself, the people's princess wed her devoted, low born, but kind credit card holder in a beautiful ceremony lit by the ashen skies courtesy of a burning state miles away in the midst of a global pandemic.'
