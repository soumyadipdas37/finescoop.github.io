Alisson has admitted that Liverpool 'dropped' their high standards after the Premier League restart last season but insists they are now 'back on the right path.'

Jurgen Klopp's side were outstanding prior to the pausing of the season in March, losing just once as they surged towards a first league title win in 30 years.

But although they did secure their championship during the summer months, Liverpool only took 17 points from a possible 27 in their final nine matches.

This was less than both Manchester clubs, as well as Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.

Liverpool have started the new season with back-to-back victories - a thrilling 4-3 win over Leeds and a more composed 2-0 success at Chelsea - and their Brazilian keeper says they've getting back to their best.

'We know that we dropped a little bit, we don't know why,' Alisson told Sky Sports ahead of Monday's meeting with Arsenal.

'It wasn't something we wanted to do but we knew we had to go back to our path if we want to be competitive this season for the title, because I believe this season the level is higher.'

The 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge was especially satisfying for Alisson, who added: 'I like the intensity of the game, I like the way we defended also. I what I like was our mentality on that game.

'I think we are on the right path again.'

Arsenal defeated Liverpool 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium back in July and Mikel Arteta's side also won the Community Shield on penalties last month.

Alisson said: 'You can see they are playing together, really well organised in the defensive phase and they have fantastic strikers with really good quality.

'But also, I believe now with more games played, our team will do better against them.'
