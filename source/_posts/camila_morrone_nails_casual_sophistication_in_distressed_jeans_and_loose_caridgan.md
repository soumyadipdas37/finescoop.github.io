She has been getting closer to her boyfriend of nearly three years, Leonardo DiCaprio, during lockdown. 

But Camila Morrone enjoyed a day with just her beloved rescue husky on Friday.   

The 23-year-old beauty dressed casually for her outing in Los Angeles, opting for distressed jeans and a loose cardigan.

The Buenos Aires-born actress paired her light wash jeans, that features rips at her knees, with a plain white tank and black undergarments. 

As she headed back to her car, with a juice in hand, her beige calf-length cardigan fell off her shoulders. 

She added simple touches to her look, with layered gold necklaces hanging on her chest and white Nike Air Force 1 sneakers. 

Keeping her hands available for her drink, Morrone carried her essentials in a beige canvas tote bag on her shoulder.

The Valley Girl actress loaded the white and brown husky whom she rescued earlier this year into her car before settling in herself.  

Keeping herself looking effortless, she tied her brunette locks up into a stylish bun and added a grey face mask for protection amid the pandemic. 

She is frequently spotted with her Oscar-winning beau, whom she has been linked to since later 2017.    

At the time, Us Weekly reported the couple were 'hooking up.'  The relationship has grown progressively more and more serious since then, with Camila even accompanying him to this year's Academy Awards.

Just a number: The Valley Girl actress isn't bothered by criticism of their age gap, stating: 'I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date'

The 'It' couple has faced plenty of criticism over their 22-year age gap, as DiCaprio has been known to date in her very specific age group.

The Valley Girl actress isn't bothered by it though, which she admitted to the Los Angeles Times in December.

She said: 'There's so many relationships in Hollywood — and in the history of the world — where people have large age gaps. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.'

Morrone continued: 'I understand the association, but I'm confident that will continue to slip away and be less of a conversation.'
