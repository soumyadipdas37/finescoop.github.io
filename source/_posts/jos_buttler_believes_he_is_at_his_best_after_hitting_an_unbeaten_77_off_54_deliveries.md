Jos Buttler believes he is hitting the ball as sweetly as ever after helping England to victory in the second T20 against Australia in Southampton.

Buttler struck an unbeaten 77 off 54 deliveries to seal a series victory with seven balls to spare, and admitted: ‘It is amazing how it can turn around, isn’t it, if you hang in there long enough? I have really missed playing T20 cricket so I was looking forward to this series.

‘I love the format and I am feeling in good touch. When you play against Australia it gives you a lot of determination to play well, and the competition for places in the side has really been driving me.’

Asked whether he sees himself as opener in next year’s World Cup in India, Buttler replied: ‘It probably is my favoured position to bat in T20 cricket. I’ve had most of my success at the top.’

Australia’s opening bowler Mitchell Starc said his team would have to reassess their plans to Buttler, who has now scored 119 runs in this series off 83 balls. ‘When you get someone striking the way he has during the last two games, it's obviously powerful for T20 cricket. We’ll have to chat as a group tomorrow.’

England have called up Sussex opener Phil Salt for the one-day series starting in Manchester on Friday as cover for Jason Roy, who is fighting to be fit after picking up a side strain.

Meanwhile, the first live coverage of an England-Australia game on BBC TV since 1997 was not helped when star commentator Michael Vaughan couldn’t get into the Ageas Bowl because the results of his latest test for Covid-19 had been delayed. Vaughan ended up missing the whole of the Australian innings and the start of the England reply before he took his place behind the mike.
