A stylish toddler has amassed a huge online following thanks to her $20,000 designer wardrobe packed with pieces from Gucci, Versace and Givenchy.

Anita Felix, who is just two-years-old, has accumulated more than 12,000 followers on Instagram because of the daily snaps her mother Stela shares of her latest luxury buys. 

The account is run by 'momager' Stela, 27, from Yorba Linda, California, who discovered her love for designer brands when working as a personal shopper before giving birth to her daughter.

Stela has forked out a shocking $20,000 on glamorous clothes for her daughter including labels such as Balmain, Gucci, Versace, Fendi and Givenchy - and despite receiving some backlash, she has no plans on curbing her spending.

The stay-at-home mother said she loves posing Anita up for fashion pictures for her Instagram account and has already collaborated with several brands.

Stela and her husband Ashvin, 32, who works as a physician, have recently introduced another member to the family, three-month-old Luka who already has his fair share of luxury clothing.

The mother said: 'When she was born, I started posting one or two pictures a month and saw a lot of interest from other Instagram pages who were reposting her.

'So, I slowly converted my Instagram into hers. She gets featured on a lot of popular Instagram pages and designer clothing shops for children.

'I was a personal shopper at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York which is a luxury department store and that's where I developed my love for designer clothes.'

She added: 'Anita's wardrobe is 95 per cent designer and is worth $20,000 - there are a lot of people in this world who don't have the opportunity to buy their children designer clothes, but I do and I want to give her the best.

The mother said: 'When Anita (pictured last winter) was born, I started posting one or two pictures a month and saw a lot of interest from other Instagram pages who were reposting her'

However, not everyone is a fan of Stela's decision to make Anita (pictured) into an influencer - with some suggesting the mother spends too much on her daughter

'We get a lot of negative comments from people who think I spend too much on her,' the mother admitted. Pictured, Anita sporting a Gucci swimsuit and Versace shoes

Stela said: 'She's been gifted a few things from different companies which is always amazing - you can even find her on a card when you order from an online designer store for children'

'Sometimes she will ask me to take a picture of her but sometimes she doesn't want her picture taken, so I just have to go with her mood - she can definitely be a diva.'

'We get a lot of negative comments from people who think I spend too much on her,' the mother admitted.

'They think it's a waste of money. But I would love to have grown up with designer clothing, and now I have the ability to do what I think is best for me and my daughter.
