You can always expect a dreamy collection from Zimmermann and Creative Director Nicky Zimmermann's spring 2021 does not disappoint. 

Wild Botanica was inspired by the flora and fauna of her home country.  

'We often start a collection with a focus on print and this season I wanted to work with botanical art with an Australian focus – the unique floral shapes and the unexpected color combinations,' said Nicky.

'We often start a collection with a focus on print and this season I wanted to work with botanical art with an Australian focus – the unique floral shapes and the unexpected color combinations,' said Nicky.

'I came across works by Ellis Rowan, a trailblazing artist, naturalist and explorer from the turn of the last century, who’s style traversed science and creativity.

'She was known for painting accurate depictions of wildflowers, insects and birds but with a very feminine, colorful and imaginative handle.' 

The Sydney-born brand partnered with the National Library of Australia to bring ten of these works to life in various prints in the collection.  

 'We thought about buoyant and diaphanous looks, balanced against crisp, masculine tailoring.'

 Attention to detail applies to every piece with printed fringing and handstitched butterfly embellishments unexpected and pleasant surprises.

Taking florals to the next level, laser-cut petal flourishes were carefully placed given the art a 3-D quality.

Girly styles were grounded with sheer, papery organdy, clean-cut silhouettes and suiting in a neutral, milky palette.

In true Zimmermann fashion, attention to detail applies to every piece with cascading blooms and handstitched butterfly embellishments being unexpected but pleasant surprises.

Natural elements in the form of agate charm bracelets, leather rope belts and woven raffia separates gave the collection an earthy feel.

Known for their feminine aesthetic and delicate, soft silhouettes, even suiting was relaxed and teamed with lingerie.
