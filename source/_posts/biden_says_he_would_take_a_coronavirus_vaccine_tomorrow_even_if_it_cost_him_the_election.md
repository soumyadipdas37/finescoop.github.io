Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he'd take a coronavirus vaccine 'tomorrow' even if it caused him to lose the 2020 presidential election to President Donald Trump. 

'If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I'd do it. If it would cost me the election I'd do it,' Biden said Monday on a campaign trip to Lancaster and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 'We need a vaccine and we need it now. As quickly as we can get it.'

On the White House's North Portico Monday, Trump said Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris needed to ''immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric.' 

Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he's take a coronavirus vaccine 'tomorrow' even if it cost him the election during a campaign stop Monday in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 'We need a vaccine and we need it now. As quickly as we can get it' 

Joe Biden was asked if he'd take a coronavirus vaccine if one was available before the November 3 presidential election, to which he said yes, but also if it was vouched for by scientists and medical professionals 

Over the weekend, Harris had told CNN that she would not trust Trump's word on the safety of a coronavirus vaccine, because she feared he might fast-track it to help him win the November 3 election. 

'I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about. I will not take his word for it,' the California senator said. 

On the campaign trail, Biden hammered Trump for turning the coronavirus generally into a political football. 

'One of the problems is the way he's playing with politics. He's said so many things that aren't true. And I'm worried that if we do have a really good vaccine people are going to be reluctant to take it,' Biden told reporters outside a Lancaster campaign stop. 

'And so he's undermining public confidence,' Biden added. 

Biden also said he would want experts to vouch for a vaccine.  

'I would want to see what the scientists said,' he said when asked if he'd be comfortable taking a vaccine. 

Trump infamously suggested in the White House briefing room that Americans might be able to inject disinfectants or use sunlight to kill the virus - after hearing that those things kill the coronavirus on surfaces. 

Trump also pushed the drug hydroxychloroquine, which still hasn't measured up as a true coronavirus cure. 

The president has also allowed supporters to be lax about mask-wearing and social distancing. 

He gave his Republican National Convention speech in front of an audience of 1,500 at the White House, where the chairs weren't socially distanced. 

He greeted crowds Wednesday in Wilmington, North Carolina who were pressed together at the airport with most not wearing masks. 

And he held a rally with thousands in both an airport hangar and then in overflow in Latrobe, Pennsylvania on Thursday night. 

Again, most of the crowd was scrunched together and not wearing masks. 

Biden and Harris started traveling more the week after the RNC, but have only met with small groups so far. 

On Monday, Biden first met with four union members in Lancaster for a discussion. 

There, he criticized Trump for spending too much time golfing, as the president played a game Sunday at his Virginia golf club.    

'He has been spending too much time on the golf courses and the sand traps,' Biden said during a campaign stop in Lancaster, Pennsylvania Monday. 

The former VP continued to capitalize on The Atlantic's reporting that Trump had called American war dead 'losers' and 'suckers.' 

 Biden asked Howard Nash, a member of the National Guard, what he thought of Trump's comments.

'Do you think most of those guys are suckers?' Biden asked. 

Three of those four participants in the discussion were veterans.
