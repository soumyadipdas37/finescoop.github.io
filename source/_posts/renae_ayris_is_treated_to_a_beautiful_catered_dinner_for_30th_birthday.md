She's the former Miss Universe Australia who has since become a brand ambassador and lifestyle influencer.

And on Saturday, Renae Ayris was treated to a surprise dinner for her 30th birthday in Sydney, by her closest friends and husband Andrew Papadopoulos.

In Instagram photos, the blonde beauty could not wipe the smile off her face as she celebrated the occasion with pals including Bachelor star Brittany Hockley.
