Sarah Harris and Angela Bishop recounted their heartbreaking experiences with miscarriages in a very emotional episode of Studio 10 on Monday.

Speaking publicly for the first time about their tragic miscarriages, both women confessed they weren't even aware of what the other had been through until recently, confessing there was a stigma about talking about it.

Sarah, 39, who was verging on tears during the segment, revealed she'd suffered a miscarriage eight weeks into her first pregnancy, and admitted just reliving it was causing her to get 'all shaky'.

'It was the day before the Logies... and I was trying on Spanx, as you do, and I was in the change room, and there was just blood everywhere,' she said. 

'I called my mother-in-law and said, "I don't know what's happening," and she said, "You're probably having a miscarriage."'

Sarah said she called her GP, who confirmed she was indeed having a miscarriage, and advised her to go for a scan on the Monday.

'For 36 hours, I just bled and thought, "Oh, well. That's my first baby gone," and I kind of just dealt with it in my own way,' she revealed.

But after going for the scan, the sonographer discovered another heartbeat, and told Sarah she'd miscarried a twin, before she safely delivered her first son, Paul, in December 2015.

Sarah said the revelation that she was still pregnant led to what she described as a 'horror' few weeks, where she was too afraid to do anything in case she lost the other baby, too.

She admitted that it was still something she was coming to terms with, having never really dealt with it.

'I don't think I really took the time to grieve it, because I had that beautiful baby in the end,' she confessed.

Meanwhile, Angela, 53, became tearful, dabbing her eyes with a tissue as she revealed she was a week late going for her eight-week scan, and when she did finally see her obstetrician, she was told the baby had no heartbeat.

The mum-of-one said she was already terrified of going for pregnancy scans, because her 13-year-old daughter Amelia's heart condition had been diagnosed during the 20-week scan.

'I never really dealt with it, and I now know in retrospect that I went into a pretty bad period of depression,' she added. 

Both women admitted they were shocked to hear about each other's experiences, and said the 'taboo' culture of discussing miscarriages was something that needed to change.
