Amy Tinkler has launched another scathing attack on British Gymnastics - accusing them of only contacting her when they have been publicly called out.

The Rio 2016 bronze medallist wrote an explosive open letter to the governing body’s chief executive Jane Allen on Wednesday, claiming she was ‘hanging gymnasts out to dry’.

Tinkler’s main gripe was that she had still not received an explanation as to why the formal complaint she made against British Gymnastics and their head coach Amanda Reddin was dismissed last month.

Following the open letter which she posted on social media, British Gymnastics integrity director Richard Evans emailed the 20-year-old and offered a face-to-face meeting.

But Tinkler has replied to that email in another public post, questioning why it was Evans who contacted her and not Allen, and why the organisation had not responded to her emails in the last two weeks.

She wrote: ‘It is your department that has been ignoring me for the past 25 days so I hope you understand how frustrating it is that you only reply when publicly prompted.

Tinkler submitted a formal complaint months ago but she was told it was dismissed

‘Were you aware of my previous emails? What was the reason for ignoring me?

‘My letter and the questions within it were addressed to Jane Allen and I hope she answers them within the timeframe. I think I deserve that. Has Jane spoken to you?

‘I emailed your department on August 24th and September 1st and 10th with questions. Rather than a call or meeting, I’d be grateful if you’d answer those questions.

‘My preference isn’t to have this conversation in public, however after 272 days of waiting I have no confidence in your departments ability to be honest, moral and deliver an outcome in private.

‘Do you understand why I feel like that? What are you going to do to improve?’

Tinkler says she retired from the sport in January as a result of her negative experiences 

Tinkler was Team GB’s youngest medallist at the Rio Olympics when she won bronze in the floor exercise at the age of only 16.

She quit gymnastics in January this year, a month after she made her formal complaint about mistreatment in the sport.

An independent investigation – the Whyte Review – has been launched into allegations of abuse in gymnastics following a string of complaints this summer.
