She was seen over the summer riding her bike in the same lovely dress.

And Famke Janssen again looked sublime in her cinched red, white and black floral midi dress on Wednesday, as she strolled around Manhattan's West Village district in New York City.

The X-Men star, 55, also had a black jacket hanging around her shoulders for the outing, as it has begun cooling off in New York after the summer. 

Lady in red, and white: Famke Janssen again looked sublime in her cinched red, white and black floral midi dress on Wednesday, as she strolled around Manhattan's West Village district 

Famke's striking red dress featured a white floral pattern with touches of black.

Her garment was cinched below the bust, and featured a low V-cut neckline. 

The Amstelveen, Netherlands-born film star's dress also boasted an interesting, asymmetrical hem, which hung around her knees.

From her other arm, Famke carried a Norval Foundation tote bag, also in red to match her ensemble. 

The Goldeneye star let her long brown hair hang loose, and she kept her nose and mouth covered with a black face mask per CDC recommendations. 

In early August, the former Bond girl was seen looking radiant on her bike in downtown Manhattan, wearing the same dress. 

Up next for Janssen are two films, thriller Way Down opposite Freddie Highmore, and the romance Redeeming Love with Nina Dobrev.
