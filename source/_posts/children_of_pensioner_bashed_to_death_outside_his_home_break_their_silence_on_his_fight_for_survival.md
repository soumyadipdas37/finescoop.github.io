The adult children of a pensioner who was brutally beaten outside his home have opened up on his agonising 15-day battle for survival before he died in hospital. 

Emiliano Lombardi was attacked with pieces of broken mirror outside his home in East Cannington in Perth's south on August 16.

The 84-year-old was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital the next morning and remained in intensive care until his death 15 days later.

His children Dom Lombardi and Laura Hussein have spoken out on their father's excruciating fight for life and the painful reminders of his suffering.

'That roller coaster ride is unbearable,' Mr Lombardi told 9News. 'Those 15 days were complete torture.'

Australians were shocked at the gory images of Mr Lombardi's injuries which showed the great grandfather covered in blood.

Mr Lombardi had gone outside to investigate a disturbance at about 7pm when he was brutally slashed with the car mirror shards. 

He suffered a broken nose, eye injuries, and numerous deep cuts and spent a week in an induced coma where he underwent facial surgery.

Ms Hussein said the image of her beaten father would haunt her forever.

'As soon as it goes quiet, I just see that image so that's going to be etched on my mind, I think for the rest of my life,' she said.

The brutal bashing has sparked calls for mandatory sentencing levels for people who commit attacks against the elderly.

Mr Lombardi said he did not think this would be a factor in changing the mindset of criminals.

'We should as a community be thinking "how do we prevent this from the beginning?"' he said. 

WA Police have arrested two men as part of an investigation into the horrific bashing on August 20.

Both 28-year-old Quade Karsum Jones from Seville Grove and a 24-year-old man from Armadale were taken into custody.  

Jones, a roofing tradie, was charged over the attack on Mr Lombardi, an indecent assault on a woman in her 40s and an assault on a man and woman in their 20s.

Police will allege the attack on the great grandfather was committed as part of a rampage that lasted for an hour from 6.30pm and 7.30pm.

His charges include intent to do grievous bodily harm, indecent assault, robbery, and assault occasioning bodily harm.

Jones is expected to remain behind bars until September 15 after briefly facing Perth Magistrates Court on August 21. 

The 24-year-old man who allegedly joined Jones on his alleged crime spree was charged with multiple counts of criminal damage and firearm and drug crimes. 

The alleged rampage included the four assaults, graffiti and letterbox damage and a brick thrown through a window.  

WA Police said the Homicide Squad have taken over the investigation and the charges may be upgraded. 

The investigation is ongoing.

News of the attack prompted neighbours and local tradesmen to look after Mr Lombardi's home while he was hospitalised. 

Tradies volunteered to repaint and plaster the great grandfather's home, while neighbours visited daily to look after his chickens and vegetable garden. 

Businesses also offered to provide new furniture and bedding after his sheets were stained with blood.

A local vet found a dogsitter for Mr Lombardi's pets and dozens of get-well cards were sent to the hospital by strangers. 

Quade Karsum Jones is taken into custody by police. Police allege his attack on the great grandfather was part of a rampage through the suburb for an hour between 6.30 and 7.30pm
