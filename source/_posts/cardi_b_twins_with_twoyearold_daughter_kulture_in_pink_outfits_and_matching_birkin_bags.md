It was inspired by the Texas-born rappers solo scene in their hit music video in a white tiger strip painted room with two of the animals. 

Their video, directed by Colin Tilley and featured cameos from Kylie Jenner and Normani among others, also made history on Youtube, earning the biggest ever debut week for an all-female hip-hop collaboration, which has amassed 103M views as of Monday.

WAP marks Cardi's (born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar) fourth Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 after Girls Like You with Maroon 5 and I Like It with Bad Bunny and J Balvin both in 2018, and her solo track Bodak Yellow in 2017. 

For Megan it is her second No. 1 on the chart ever and her second this year, following her Savage (Remix) with Beyonce in May.
