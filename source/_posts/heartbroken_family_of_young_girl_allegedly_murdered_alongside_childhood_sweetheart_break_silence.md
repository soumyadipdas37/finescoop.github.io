The family of a teenager allegedly gunned down by her boyfriend's father have broken their silence to express their heartbreak and pride.

Chelsea Ireland and Lukasz Kłosowski, both 19, were shot dead about 11.30pm on August 23 at a family gathering in Mount McIntyre, South Australia.

Lukasz's father Pawel 'Paul' Kłosowski, 46, was charged with two counts of murder - and had been estranged from his son since the boy was four.

Chelsea's parents Debra and Greg Ireland tearfully described how the engineering student and environmentalist wanted to change the world.

'We haven't just lost a daughter, we've lost a best friend and a sister,' Mr Ireland said on the front lawn of their Adelaide home.

'We've lost our baby girl and we miss her beyond what any words can describe. Our hearts will forever remain broken.'

Her cousin Savannah Ireland explained the devastating impact Chelsea's death had on the entire family.

'I don't have many tears left now. There was such a loss here for me and so many other people,' she said in an Instagram video.

Consoled by Chelsea's older sister Maddie, 22, Mr and Mrs Ireland said they were comforted to know the impact their daughter had on those she knew.

'It brings comfort to know Chelsea's kind and caring heart and bright smile has left a lasting impression on people she met,' Mr Ireland said.

'Chelsea was compassionate, strong, selfless and fearless and continues to make us proud every day.'

Mrs Ireland spoke of her daughter's passion for the environment that led her to study mechanical engineering at Adelaide University.

'She was going to change the world with her recycling, reusing and saving the planet, and climate change. She had great plans,' she said.

'She had so many different sides to her — she was strong, fearless, passionate, determined, opinionated, but then she had such a beautiful, kind heart and gentle soul and really just saw the best in everybody.'

Mrs Ireland told of how when she was just 15 years old, Chelsea watched a YouTube video that inspired her to donate her waist-length brown locks to cancer patients.

The hair, along with a donation of $1,000, was given to the Royal Adelaide Hospital's wig recycling and loan service in 2015 and went on to be a wig for a cancer patient.

She went on to volunteer at Puddle Jumpers Incorporated, caring for vulnerable children and young people.

Chelsea's father said they 'were an amazing couple, they were just best buddies, they had shared a love of music together'

Lukasz shared her passion, with the couple buying their families metal straws and reusable bread and fruit bags and planning to buy a Tesla when they were older.

Chelsea's father also grieved for Lukasz who 'brought smiles to our faces and laughter' to their home and was becoming part of their family.

'They were an amazing couple, they were just best buddies, they had shared a love of music together,' he said. 

Savannah Ireland tearfully recalled how she woke up the morning after the shooting to her brother telling her Chelsea and Lukasz were both dead. 

'Chelsea was the most beautiful thing on the planet, and she was going to make big things happen and create so much magic,' she said. 

'She made people feel capable in their own skin. I just know she was going to do beautiful things, and that makes it really hard. 

'Chelsea wanted to leave this world more beautiful than when she arrived in it. She was so unapologetically and authentically herself and that was something I always admired about her.'

Lukasz's father Paul Kłosowski, 46, (pictured) is charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing his estranged son and his son's girlfriend 

Lukasz was studying journalism at the University of South Australia while working at KFC, a job he and his friends made numerous jokes about. 

He had barely seen his father since Kłosowski's relationship with his mother Magdalena broke down about 2005. 

Photos of Lukasz about that time show him with his mother, and another clutching a decoration reading 'Sto Lat (Happy Birthday) Lukasz'. 

Family friends said Magdalena limited contact between her ex-husband and her son, and later started dating a woman she is still in a relationship with.

Kłosowski and Lukasz only occasionally crossed paths until recent years when he tried to mend fences after marrying his wife Monica.

However, Kłosowski noted his son's absence from numerous family photos with his three stepchildren and called him 'stubborn'. 

Lukasz and Chelsea travelled from their Adelaide home for a family visit at their rural property near Millicent. 

Mount Gambier Magistrates' Court heard that two of Kłosowski's stepchildren, both aged under 14, were present for the family gathering and witnessed the shooting.

Kłosowski's social media profiles show he worked as a truck driver and was a Harley Davidson and gun enthusiast, with a .303 rifle seen in one photo.  

He appeared in court last week and did not apply for bail. He will face court again in December.
