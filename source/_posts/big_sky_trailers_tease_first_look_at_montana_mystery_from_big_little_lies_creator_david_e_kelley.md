Viewers who tuned into the Emmy Awards on Sunday night were also treated to a sneak peek at ABC's new mystery series Big Sky.

Three brief trailers were shown throughout the telecast, offering the first footage of the new series from Big Little Lies creator David E. Kelley. 

The show, which is based on the series of novels written by Cody Max, will debut Tuesday, November 14 at 10 PM ET on ABC.

First trailer: Viewers who tuned into the Emmy Awards on Sunday night were also treated to a sneak peek at ABC's new mystery series Big Sky

The first trailer features the focal points of the show - two sisters Denise (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Grace (Jade Pettyjohn) - who are kidnapped during a road trip to Montana.

The first trailer, set to Ben E. King's Stand By Me, begins with Trooper Rick Legarski (John Carroll Lynch) of the Montana Highway Patrol, who gives private detective Cody Hoyt (Ryan Phillippe) a call.

'I hear you're looking for two missing teenagers?' Legarsski inquires, as Hoyt confirms he's looking for them, 'last seen in a red Focus, Colorado plates.'

The trailer cuts to the teenagers in their car, just before the abduction, as a worried Grace asks, 'Are we in the right place?'

Suddenly something happens to their car, with Denise stating, 'The steering wheel is all stiff' as their car comes to a stop.

Just after they stop, a truck pulls up, and while Denise is clearly happy to be 'rescued,' Grace does not share the same optimism, telling her sister to 'lock the door.'

Truck: Just after they stop, a truck pulls up, and while Denise is clearly happy to be 'rescued,' Grace does not share the same optimism, telling her sister to 'lock the door'

When Denise retorts, 'What? We're fine,' a mysterious man smashes their window and pulls Denise out of the car.

The trailer also shows brief shots of another private investigator, Cassie Dewell (Kylie Bunbury) and ex-cop/Cody's estranged wife Jenny (Kathryn Winnick), who join forces with Cody to find the girls.

The first trailer ends with Legarski eating a pretzel and telling Cody, 'We've got ourselves a predicament.'

Predicament: The first trailer ends with Legarski eating a pretzel and telling Cody, 'We've got ourselves a predicament'

The second brief trailer, set to Nancy Sinatra's These Boots Are Made For Walking, opens with Cassie telling Legarski that, 'two teenage girls vanished, possibly abducted,' though Legarski is skeptical.

'What are the odds?' Legarski asks, as Cassie shoots back, 'They give out odds on that sort of thing?'

Cody also reveals there have been, '12 missing females all within a 100 mile radius' as we see a mystery woman get into a semi truck parked at a diner called the Dirty Spoon.

Legarski warns that, 'things are about to take an ugly turn, while we see Jenny's son ask, 'are we just gonna wait?'

'No, we do not wait,' Jenny says with conviction, while another shot seemingly shows Jenny and Cassie getting into a bar fight.

A casting report from Deadline in February revealed that Jenny gets involved with the case because one of the missing girls is her son's girlfriend.

Ugly: Legarski warns that, 'things are about to take an ugly turn, while we see Jenny's son ask, 'are we just gonna wait?'

The second trailer again end with Legarski saying, 'We've got ourselves a predicament.'

The third trailer only features random shots like an overhead shot of the Dirty Spoon, as a man talks about why he loves Montana, for the 'clean air, open roads, friendly folks,' as we see the teenagers' kidnapping.
