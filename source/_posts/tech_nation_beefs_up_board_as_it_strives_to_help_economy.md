Boost: Tech Nation helps nurture British technology companies

Tech Nation – the Government-backed technology industry body – has beefed up its board as it strives to help the economy recover from the coronavirus crisis. 

Eric Collins, a black entrepreneur who helped Barack Obama's start-up diversity drive, is among the four new directors. 

Collins, who served on Obama's Small Business Administration's Council on Underserved Communities, runs London-based Impact X, an investment firm that backs companies run by or for minority groups and women. 

The other directors are Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures, Annette Wilson, the European chair of venture capital firm Antler, and Trecilla Lobo of BenevolentAI, the biotech firm with artificial intelligence technology. 

Tech Nation said the merit-based appointments took into account the 'benefits of diversity'. 

Tech Nation helps nurture British technology companies. It is aiming to help the tech sector boost the economy by an extra $1billion by March 2022.
