A teenager has been arrested after he allegedly imported almost $190,000 worth of methamphetamine hidden in coffee sachets sent from Malaysia

The 19-year-old is now behind bars after being arrested at his home in Booragoon in Perth's south on Tuesday and charged with importing 93 grams of ice.

Australian Border Force officers allegedly found a white crystal-like substance hidden in the sachets in an air cargo consignment which allegedly returned a positive result to the drug.

AFP officers then swapped the contents of the package and after the delivery was made they searched the teenager's home, allegedly finding it in his bedroom.

The 19-year-old was charged with attempting to possess a marketable quantity of unlawfully imported border controlled drugs and could face a maximum of 25 years in jail.

At the end of last month another man from Perth was charged with importing 114 grams of meth from Malaysia.

The 35-year-old allegedly hid the drugs inside a bottle of cooling powder.

AFP Detective Superintendent Tim Underhill said the drugs seized both had an extremely high street value. 

'These two seizures equate to more than two thousand street level deals of the drug, which are currently being sold for $200 each,' he said.

'This means the sale of 95 grams would have netted approximately $190,000 in street deals, while 114 grams was worth $228,000. 

'Methamphetamine causes harm, not only to users and the people in contact with them, but to the broader community, because drugs are a key factor in a range of serious criminal offending.'

The 35-year-old is in custody and will appear in court on September 25.

The 19-year-old was due to face court on Wednesday.
