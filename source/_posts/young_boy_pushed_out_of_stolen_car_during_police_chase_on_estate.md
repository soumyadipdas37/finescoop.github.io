This is the shocking moment a young boy is thrown out of a stolen car during a police pursuit though a housing estate.

Dash-cam footage shows officers from Greater Manchester Police pursing a blue Ford Kuga through Hattersley in Tameside at speeds of up to 61 mph when the young child is pushed out of the stolen vehicle onto the road.

Seconds later, a man runs out of the car and a shocked female police officer is heard telling her colleagues: 'Oh my God, a child and a man have just bailed out, the female driver is continuing.' 

Following the scenes, the two adults were arrested for burglary, handling, dangerous driving and failing to stop and safeguarding measures were put into place for the child. 

The blue Ford Kuga drives though the housing estate in Hattersley, Tameside, Greater Manchester, as an unmarked police car follows close behind

Moments later a child is pushed out of the car and lands on the road and a shocked female police officer is heard telling her colleagues: 'Oh my God, a child and a man have just bailed out, the female driver is continuing'

The chase started after officers were alerted to a 'thieves on' report in the early hours in Duckinfield. 

They were given a description of the suspects' car and minutes later two officers from GMP's Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit (TVIU) spotted the blue Kuga which had been taken during a burglary in Tameside. 

Police officers then began to pursue the car but the female driver realised she was being followed by an unmarked police car and sped through the streets.

During the footage, which was filmed on August 1, the blue Kuga accelerates through the residential streets and the unmarked police car follows close behind.   

Moments later, the vehicle slows down and a child is pushed onto the road, as the shocked officer says: 'Oh my God, a child and a man have just bailed out, the female driver is continuing.'

Both the child and the man run into the distance as the stolen car continues to accelerate through the housing estate.

Police were eventually able to catch the driver after she stopped the vehicle and attempted to flee the scene.   

At Manchester Crown Court in Minshull Street, the driver of the Kuga, Lauren Ashley Willis, 28, from Hyde, was given 16 months suspended for two years. She admitted dangerous driving and theft.

She was also ordered to complete a 35-day rehabilitation programme and was disqualified from driving for 18 months.

David Daniel Skelly, 35, also from Hyde, was given a 20 months sentence, suspended for two years. 

He admitted burglary and aggravated vehicle taking and was ordered to complete a 30 day rehabilitation programme and a thinking skills programme.

He must also complete 100 hours of unpaid work and was banned from driving for 12 months.

A short time before the chase Skelly had broken into a house in Dukinfield, and stolen car keys, a vacuum cleaner, wine, and tobacco.

Sgt Danny Kabal of the TVIU said: 'During the pursuit, a small child was thrown from the rear of the vehicle.

'As you can imagine, this completely shocked the officers. Seconds later, a male adult then jumped out of the car and they both ran away. The vehicle then continued to drive away.

'Once the identity of the female driver was established, officers managed to locate an associated address in the immediate vicinity.

'My staff attended the address and located the male and young child.

'The small boy was being used to commit burglaries by pushing him through open windows of houses to search for car keys.

'The video paints the picture. The two adults were arrested for burglary, handling, dangerous driving and failing to stop. Safeguarding measures were put into place for the child.'
