Southampton have taken legal action against their former shirt sponsors LD Sports.

The club were forced to switch sponsors less than three weeks before the new season after failing to receive assurances from the Chinese media company that they would be able to fulfil their three-year, £7.5million contract.

The concerns forced the club to terminate the agreement early with a frantic late rush to find a replacement sponsor to ensure they were not out of pocket going into the new season.

And they could not wait any longer for guarantees from LD Sports, whose deal began last summer.

Still, the change has hit them financially as their agreement with replacement sponsors sportsbet.io is worth less.

Southampton also have an additional headache to resolve, having launched and sold their new shirt designs with their old sponsors’ logo on them.

They have instructed lawyers to investigate whether the situation means they have a claim for a breach of contract.

Chief executive Martin Semmens vowed Southampton will pursue LD Sports ‘to the end of the earth’.

He told The Athletic: ‘(Legal action) is not being considered. It’s already taken. It’s something we have to do. We will continue pursuing them and finding a solution that will help our club out but we feel that will take months and not weeks.’
