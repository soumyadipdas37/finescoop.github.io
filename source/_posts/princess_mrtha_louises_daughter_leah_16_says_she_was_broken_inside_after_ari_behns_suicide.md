Princess Märtha Louise's daughter Leah has revealed she felt 'so broken inside' after her father Ari Behn's suicide as she marked his birthday yesterday. 

Leah Behn, 15, shared an emotional Instagram post on what would have been her father's 48th birthday this week.

Author Mr Behn, who was married to Martha Louise for 15 years and shared three children with the royal, was found dead after taking his own life on Christmas Day last year.

In the heartbreaking post, the teenager shared a picture alongside her father and another of his gravestone, writing: 'Going through something like this made me feel so many emotions...I felt so broken inside and walked around feeling like it was all a dream and this wasn’t real or it didn’t happen. But it did.'

Sharing the post with her 19,000 followers online, the 15-year-old wrote: 'Happy birthday Dad. 

'9 months ago, my dad passed away from suicide. This has been and will always be the toughest tragedy me and my family have had to go through. 

'I really don’t know what to say. I miss him so much and I wish that things were different.'

She continued: 'I have never really ever been open about this on social media, because I was scared and sharing my feelings seemed terrifying.'

In a heartbreaking Instagram post, the teenager shared a picture of her father's gravestone and said she wondered whether she 'deserved' to be happy 

Leah explained she has had 'so many thoughts that she will never ever be able to explain'. adding: 'I will never forget my dad. He was an amazing human with so many good intentions and always wanted everyone to have a good time. I loved him so much.'

She went on to say that going through the loss of her father had 'changed' her, saying: 'It has given me a whole different perspective in life, and if you love someone you tell them. You never know when you will loose them. 

'Sometimes when I’m happy and I catch myself having fun, I stop and think. Do I deserve this? Am I allowed to feel like this?

Leah, whose mother Princess Märtha Louise separated from Ari in 2017, said she had been left 'broken inside' by his death (pictured, Leah with her mother)

'And of course I am. Everyone deserves to be happy. But you never know what someone is going through and everyone fights there own battles. Remember to always be nice.

'This didn’t make me stronger or brave, it made me realize how strong I already was. I miss you so much dad. Love you and Happy Birthday!'

Her mother  Princess Märtha Louise was quick to comment on the post, writing: ' Your dad is so proud of how strong you are and how heartfelt your words are. He loves you so much.

The teenager shared the deeply personal note with her Instagram followers as she urged them to 'always be nice' to one another

'I am so proud of you for sharing this, darling. Love you with all my heart.'

Meanwhile her boyfriend Shaman Durek also commented on the post, sharing a small heart emoji beneath Princess  Märtha's comment. 

Ari separated from the fourth in line to the Norwegian throne in 2017, who he had three daughters with called Maud, 17, Leah, and Emma, 12. 

Meanwhile Princess Märtha and her boyfriend Shaman Durek were quick to show their support to the teenager and left comments on her post
