Soon after leaping into the air, the Hollywood screen star let go of the motorbike, allowing it to fall to the grown as he continued his descent in a parachute.

According to eyewitnesses on the set, the awe-inspiring stunt took four takes to pull off on the steep mountainside before rolling cameras.

A helicopter was seen trailing the star as all of the death-defying action took place, as production continued on the big budget production.

On Saturday, he was seen not taking any chances as he prepared to film another heart-stopping scene while donning a face mask to practice his latest fight.

The star was dressed in all-black as he rehearsed his latest scuffle with a stuntman atop a train in Norway, after production for the blockbuster was relocated from the UK following a five-month break amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Cruise − who will reprise his role as Ethan Hunt in the spy film series − was attached to a harness for the scuffle on the roof of a train, and briefly chatted to crew members as he prepared to film the scene.

The scenes were filmed in the heart of the Norwegian countryside with a vintage-style train recreated as the setting, surrounded by plenty of scaffolding.

Never shy to take on a challenging stunt, the scene also saw Tom running towards a helicopter as it took off into the sky.

After production for Mission Impossible 7 was moved to Norway, it was reported that Cruise hired a £500,000 ship for the film's crew to avoid any coronavirus-related delays.

Filming was already delayed for five months after COVID-19 spread across Italy, where production had been based in March, leading the release date to be pushed back to November 2021.

Sources claimed the screen star rented the Hurtigruten watercraft for filming as he is 'determined' to avoid further set-backs on the franchise.

'They are terrified of further delays. Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups. The studio believes it will keep everyone safe and get this shoot wrapped up', a source told The Sun. 

It was recently claimed that Tom was 'exempt from Norway's quarantine rules' as he  restart filming in the Scandinavian country. 

The media personality revealed how 'excited' he was to start shooting the latest instalment of the franchise in a phone call with Norway’s Minister of Culture Abid Raja. 

Speaking about his return, he said: 'It’s a gorgeous country, I can’t wait to get back there. I’m very excited, as is the whole crew, about coming back.' 

During the call, the minister told how Norway is 'looking forward to having [Tom] back' and insisted how the Hollywood star and crew are allowed to shoot in the country without having to quarantine at home first, Norwegian publication VG reported.  

However, cast and crew had to pass two tests for coronavirus within 48 hours of landing in Norway and a series of daily rigorous health checks were in place.

Abid added that the film production team wouldn't not have contact with anyone that is not part of the set.

The films focus on agent Ethan and will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who previously worked on 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout in 2018.

Mission Impossible 7 will be released on November 19, 2021.
