She took on the role of a cult leader out for innocent children's blood in the popular 2017 horror flick, The Babysitter.

But loyal fans of the movie have been left disappointed with its sequel, The Babysitter: Killer Queen, which was released on Thursday on Netflix.

It appears viewers were dissatisfied after finding out that Samara only returned for a brief cameo compared to the rest of the movie's cast who were awarded prominent roles in the second instalment.

The first movie sees 12-year-old Cole survive a murderous and satanic rampage by his attractive babysitter named Bee, who is played by Samara.

In the new movie, Cole is now a junior in high school and, except for his friend Melanie, he has a difficult time making others believe that his former babysitter tried to kill him.

A trip to a lake for a party then turns disastrous when he finds out the demonic cult is still wreaking havoc.

While the sequel sounded petrifying enough, viewers were left disappointed following Samara's lack of presence.

'Wish we had more Samara!' While the sequel sounded petrifying enough, viewers were left disappointed following Samara's lack of presence

Other than some brief throwback scenes from the first movie, Samara only makes a brief appearance at the end.

Upset viewers rushed to Twitter to vent about the blonde bombshell's lack of screen time:

'Just watched #TheBabySitterKillerQueen and I love it well I wish we had more scenes of Samara but I missed her and I love her so much.'

'#TheBabySitterKillerQueen was fun but not enough Samara Weaving.'

Plot: The demonic cult from the first movie is still wreaking havoc in the sequel 





'Limited cameo': Upset viewers continued to rush to Twitter to vent about the blonde bombshell's lack of screen time

' I'll say this though: I'm kinda bummed that Samara Weaving's involvement in this seems to be limited to a cameo. Oh well.'

'Something felt off and i couldn't place it. Maybe it was the forced love story or that twist but I know it 100% needed more samara weaving.'

'I finished babysitter 2 and samara weaving was in it for two seconds.'

'The way samara weaving was only in it for 15 minutes.'

Samara's lack of screen time in The BabySitter Killer Queen may have been a result of her busy Hollywood schedule.

After winning critical acclaim for the horror Ready Or Not last year, she starred in Ryan Murphy's series Hollywood and is currently filming for the TV adaptation of Nine Perfect Strangers in Byron Bay.

Samara got her break on Australian television playing the role of Indigo Walker for almost five years on Home And Away from 2009.
