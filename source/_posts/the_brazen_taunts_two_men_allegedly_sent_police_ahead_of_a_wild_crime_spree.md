Two men allegedly sent police brazen messages challenging them to 'try catch us filthy pigs' before leading officers on separate high speed car chases. 

Kyle Salvatorie Mathiot, 25, and Cameron Welch, 28, were already wanted by authorities for several days leading up to the alleged car rampage in Queensland's far north. 

About 8pm on Tuesday night, Mathiot allegedly threatened threatened his father with what appeared to be a gun at his Mereeba house, west of Cairns, according to The Cairns Post.

Kyle Salvatorie Mathiot (right), 25, and Cameron Welch (left), 28, allegedly taunted police before they were arrested 

Police say he briefly stopped to steal petrol from a service station at Atherton before  driving off at speeds of up to 120km/h in his Holden Commodore until he hit police stingers placed over the asphalt. 

Despite his tyres shredding off down to the steel rims, Mathiot continued speeding along the Bruce Highway with police on his tail - driving on the wrong side of the road and through red lights. 

The car hit a pole and came to a stop at which point Mathiot was arrested and a police search of the vehicle allegedly turned up a knife.  

In the days before the incident, Mathiot posted a picture of himself and Mr Welch in a car on Facebook with the caption 'try catch us filthy pigs … love you my brother'. 

Welch was also arrested on Tuesday in Kuranda after police helicopters were called in to locate his car which had been spotted driving dangerously earlier that evening. 

Police pursuits are rare under Queensland laws, however, Cairns police Acting Sgt Russell Parker said the alleged weapon along with the 'intent' the pair had shown in the Facebook post meant the pursuit was 'authorised and justified'. 

'It was extremely dangerous behaviour,' he said, adding it was 'miraculous' nobody was injured. 

Mathiot is charged with dangerous operation of a vehicle, possession of a knife in a public place, stealing, and two counts of obstruct police. 

He was remanded in custody on a return to prison warrant, while Welch did not apply for bail and was also remanded in custody. 

They will both appear in court in October.
