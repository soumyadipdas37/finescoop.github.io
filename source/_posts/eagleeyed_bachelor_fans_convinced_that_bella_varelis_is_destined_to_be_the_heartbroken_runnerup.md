Bella Varelis a frontrunner to win Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor Australia.

But some of show's fans are now convinced that the 25-year-old stunner is destined to be the heartbroken runner-up, thanks to spotting a VERY telling clue during Thursday's episode. 

As spotted by the So! Dramatic podcast, Bella could be seen sitting on a Zoom call with a bunch of sunflowers behind her, which are synonymous with Bachelorette runner-up, Timm Hanly.

The flowers were dubbed the 'runner-up sunflowers.'

'I miss Locky so much, I really miss him,' Bella said as she longed for a one-on-one virtual date with him. 

In the Bachelor and Bachelorette fan community, sunflowers are synonymous with Timm Hanly, who placed runner-up during Angie Kent's season last year.

During the first episode of the season, the 27-year-old fireproofer had memorably given Angie a bunch of the yellow flowers.

She was touched by the gesture, as sunflowers are apparently her 'favourite'. 

Last year, Bachelorette fans were convinced that the production team wanted Angie to pick Timm.

Eagle-eyed viewers spotted a tiny detail in Angie's official portrait with her chosen suitor, Carlin Sterritt, which they believed proved the crew was secretly on 'Team Timm'.

As the couple posed in the Byron Bay countryside just moments after declaring their love for one another, a small sunflower could be seen among the bouquets at their feet.

Angie and Carlin however, have since broken up and announced their shock split in July.

Earlier this week, booted contestant Nadine Kodsi claimed that Bella and Irena make the final two on the show in a lengthy Instagram post.

The Bachelor Australia continues on Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10.
