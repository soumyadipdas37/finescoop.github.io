Jennifer and Emme posed flanking Natasha and Ella in a sweet picture that Alex posted with the caption: 'My girls. #Emme #Tachi #Ella #Macha.'

Alex proposed to Jennifer last year and presented her with her fifth engagement ring - the previous four came from her three husbands and her ex-fiance Ben Affleck.

The new Instagram post comes after a group led by 'J-Rod' were outbid by hedge fund manager Steve Cohen to purchase the New York Mets.

Steve, whose net worth Forbes estimates at $14.6 billion, is said to have paid $2.4 billion in a deal first reported by Jon Heyman of MLB network on Twitter.

'Heard the #Mets sold for more than the $2.35B that has been reported. It is for between $2.4B and $2.45B,' the New York Posts' Joel Sherman tweeted Monday.

'The previous record for a North American sports team was the $2.275B that the Panthers were sold for to another hedge fund billionaire, David Tepper.'

However they did snag a new house this July, dropping what Variety reported as $1.4 million for a three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb Encino.
