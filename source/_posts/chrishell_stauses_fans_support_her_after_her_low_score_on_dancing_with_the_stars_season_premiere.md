Chrishell Stause made her debut on Dancing With The Stars' 29th season on Monday.

But the 39-year-old Selling Sunset star had a lackluster debut after she placed third-to-last following a rough first performance with her dance partner Gleb Savchenko.

The low score left some of her fans up in arms on Twitter because they thought she did considerably better than her costars Carole Baskin and Charles Oakley.

Poor placement: Chrishell Stause, 39, got a lackluster evaluation on Monday's Dancing With The Stars premiere, where her low score put her in the bottom three, which angered some fans

Chrishell made her DWTS debut by dancing to Pink's Raise Your Glass, and she got her best marks of the evening from new judge Derek Hough, who gave her a five, her best showing.

'You are a little pigeon-toed, so everything you do is a little inward. But well done, good first dance,' he said after reminding her that the show was a marathon and she'd have time to improve. 

Longtime judge Bruno Tonioli was less sentimental and worked in a reference to her Netflix reality show in his critique.

'I know you can sell, and you managed to get the tango into escrow, but we're a long way before we're closing, darling,' he said, though he added he'd like to see what she did next week.

Bottom of the pack: Chrishell scored a 13, which only put her ahead of Charles Oakley's 12 and Carole Baskin's 11. Newcomer Derek Hough was the most enthusiastic of the judges

Snarky: 'I know you can sell, and you managed to get the tango into escrow, but we're a long way before we're closing, darling,' joked Bruno Tonioli

Chrishell even admitted she might have bitten off more than she could chew.

'The tango is a lot harder than anything I've done before. So, that says a lot right there,' she said, before complimenting Gleb for pushing her. 

Chrishell ended up with a score of 13, which only put her above Charles Oakley and Carole Baskin, who scored the lowest with an 11 for her dance to Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger. 

Many of the reality star's fans flocked to social media to express their displeasure with her low score. 

Too soon: Chrishell even admitted she might have bitten off more than she could chew. 'The tango is a lot harder than anything I've done before. So, that says a lot right there,' she said

'Are we ready to talk about how chrishell got robbed tn,' wrote one upset fan.

A common theme among the complaints was that Chrishell's performance was noticeably better than the bottom two finishers, so they thought she shouldn't have been awarded a four by two of the judges.

'My girl @Chrishell7 was ROBBED tonight on #DWTS! The tango is ridiculously hard and she deserved much higher scores! Can't wait to see her kill it next week,' wrote Caitlin Fitch.

Another user complained, 'There is NO WAY @Chrishell7 deserved the same score (4) paddle as Carol Baskin [sic]. Disappointed in you @Dancing ABC judges. Shame on you.'

Unfair: The Selling Sunset star's fans rallied to support her on Twitter, with one saying she 'got robbed'

A class of her own: A common theme among the complaints was that Chrishell's performance was noticeably better than the bottom two finishers

Too low: Some fans said she shouldn't have scored anything as low as a four because of the strength of her dance

'You can’t convince me Chrishell is only 2 points better than Carol and 1 point better than Charles,' one poster tweeted.

Some blamed the fact that the real estate agent went second for her low score, as the judges may have inflated scores for later contestants after seeing their amateur abilities in the first week.

'@Chrishell7 deserved WAY better than the judges gave her. Sucks to go second. #Teamsellingit all the way!' read one tweet.

Chrishell found herself getting more publicity than she bargained for last year after she and her husband Justin Hartley abruptly separated.

The This Is Us star allegedly told her that he wanted a divorce via a text message.

The couple had been dating since 2014 and were married in October 2017. 

Awkward order: Some blamed the fact that the real estate agent went second for her low score, as the judges may have inflated scores for later contestants after seeing their amateur abilities in the first week
