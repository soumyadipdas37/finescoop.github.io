A mother has hit out at Tesco for 'stereotyping' children after her nine-year-old daughter asked why a range of football themed masks were labelled as 'for boys'.

Sarah Louise, 43, from Nottingham, was shopping with daughter Mara at a Long Eaton branch on Sunday when they spotted the 'casual stereotyping'.

She has accused the retailer of 'propagating nonsense' with the navy blue £3.50 masks, which feature a football design. 

Tesco has been approached for comment. 

Sarah Louise, 43, has accused supermarket Tesco of 'stereotyping' children after her daughter asked why blue football themed face covering were labelled as 'boys' masks 

Full-time carer Sarah took to Facebook to complain to Tesco, after Mara urged her to raise the issue with the retailer.

She posted a snap of the product this morning and said: 'I was in your shop in Long Eaton at the weekend with my family and we spotted these 'boys' face masks at the till.

'My daughter wondered what made them suitable for her brother, but not for her. I had no good answer to give her and wondered if you could help.'

Sarah explained how the family came across the item at the end of the till.

The supermarket giant also offers pink face masks and coverings, labelled as 'girls' at some of their stores

The product in question is a pack of three face masks in a dark blue colour, featuring a football logo.

The packaging specifically states that the item is for boys aged four to eight years old.

Speaking today, she said: 'I commented on it, and my daughter raised her eyes and asked, "Why not for girls?"

'She knew it was just a stereotype, which is a bit sad at nine-years-old.

'I think casual stereotyping like this is just a small reflection of a bigger problem.

'It reinforces perceptions that certain sports and occupations are for girls and others are for boys.'

She continued: 'I felt nothing overwhelming after seeing it, just a bit irritated and sad to see a large brand, who should know better, propagating this nonsense.

'No-one really put much thought into it, it wasn't malicious, but I think it's important to challenge these sorts of stereotypes.'
