The leader of a vegan 'army' who break into farms to perform 'animal rescues' revealed her passion has resulted in receiving death threats.

Leah Ava Whetton appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday where she pleaded guilty to unlawfully entering a piggery and an egg production factory. 

The 30-year-old has previously been charged 22 times for similar offences.

The most recent charges relate to Whetton breaking into Cameron Pastoral piggery at Pittsworth in 2018, and Canningvale poultry farm Williams Eggs in 2019.

Defence barrister Nathan Edridge told the court both Whetton and her mother had been subjected to abuse since the nature of her offending became public. 

'My client... had death threats made to her and her mother and things like personal details being released,' he said before asking the court to consider the 'extra punishment' she has already received in public. 

'One of these matters included a phone call where my client was threatened to have her fingers cut off and her jaw broken,' he said.

Prior to her sentencing, Whetton revealed she wasn't sure if she would receive a custodial sentence. 

'The sentencing is still very important because I have been charged 22 times,' she said. 

'My barrister and my lawyer will have to do an amazing job not to get me a conviction today.'

The court heard she disregarded clearly signed biosecurity procedures and handled piglets and laying hens.

The court was told Whetton had a history of similar offences and her offences were 'of a continual nature'.

But defence solicitor Lumme Rynderman told the court: 'Other than this offending which is grounded in her conscience, she has no criminal history.'

Whetton was fined $1,000 and managed to escape without conviction.

After the court appearance, she immediately took to Instagram to tell her 36,000 followers that she was 'happy' with the outcome.

'No conviction, no community order, no probation, I just got a fine... so I'm happy with that. Until next time, hey.' 

'This isn't over until we are all free,' she wrote alongside the short video.  

Whetton is the founder of 'Meat the Victims', a 'new generation of the growing community of citizens willing to disobey unjust laws together to abolish animal exploitation'

Whetton is the founder of 'Meat the Victims', a 'new generation of the growing community of citizens willing to disobey unjust laws together to abolish animal exploitation'. 

The group is known for staging sit ins and protests at farms over animal rights.

'What is done in the dark will be brought to the light,' Whetton said. 

'We aren’t going anywhere. There is an army of us and it’s only growing. We won’t stop, until all are free.' 

On Wednesday, a group of Whetton's supporters accompanied her to court with posters and signs to protest.

Several of the posters featured graphic images of slaughtered and dying animals along with several slogans including 'right to rescue', 'free range is a lie' and 'I wanted to live'.
