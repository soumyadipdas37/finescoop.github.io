Celebrity chef Matt Preston has been caught falling asleep while listening to himself on breakfast radio.

The former MasterChef judge can be heard snoring in a hilarious behind-the-scenes video uploaded to Instagram by co-host Manu Feildel on Monday.

The ex-My Kitchen Rules judge, 46, shared three short clips of the 59-year-old food critic nodding off ahead of Tuesday night's Plate of Origin finale.

The three-hour special will kick off from 7.30pm on Channel Seven, and will feature four teams vying for $100,000 in a three-course cooking competition.

Manu's footage shows Matt, who is wearing a white shirt and his signature cravat, sleeping soundly while holding a phone and sitting on a blue velvet couch. 

'Even Matt falls asleep when he listens to himself,' Manu captioned the candid video.

The footage caught the attention of several TV stars, including The Block's Mark McKie and Mitch Edwards, who joked that Matt had been 'working too hard'. 

'Exclusive BTS footage. He's clearly not sleeping, he's just thinking deeply ... #PlateofOriginAU,' Many added.

Manu then shared another clip of Matt, which showed him looking worse for wear in his pajamas, as a woman speaking another language can be heard on his phone.

Meanwhile, the Frenchman mocked his sleepy friend by imitating a loud snore.

'@mattscravat is so clever. He can also learn how to speak another language in his sleep ... #PlateofOriginAU,' he wrote in the caption.

No hard feelings! Matt reacted to Manu's post with good humour, saying he had fallen asleep while listening to the radio backstage

Matt reacted to Manu's post with good humour by making fun of himself in a post shared to his own Instagram account on Tuesday.

In the footage, he pointed out that he was listening to the radio when he fell asleep.

'Thanks for sharing @manufeildelofficial. Back on @abcinmelbourne breakfast tomorrow from 5.30am, filling in for @sammyjcomedian #snoozebuttonoff,' he wrote.
