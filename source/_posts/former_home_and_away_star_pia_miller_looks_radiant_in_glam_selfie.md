Former Home and Away star Pia Miller recently reunited with her Hollywood agent boyfriend, Patrick Whitesell, 55. 

And the 36-year-old actress was positively glowing as she posed in a selfie she posted to Instagram on Monday.

Pia proved her model credentials as she shared a close-up of her glossy, made-up visage while laying on a bed.

The mother-of-two looked radiant as she lay with her eyes closed for the photograph, with her looking calm and relaxed. 

Pia wore her long brunette tresses in a wavy style, allowing them to frame her face. 

The stunning beauty wore a black button-down blouse for her impromptu shoot.  

Pia recently returned to work, shooting for luxury brand Paspaley in Sydney last week.

The Chile-born star has also been spotted around Sydney with her powerful Hollywood talent agent boyfriend, Patrick Whitesell.  

Pia spent a week with her beau, before Patrick flew back to the US on a private jet, last week.

She was first linked to the Hollywood power agent in August last year, following her split with her longtime fiancé, Tyson Mullane, 32, in April.

She made their relationship Instagram official on Christmas Eve, sharing a loved-up photo with him outside of the Louvre in Paris, and captioning it 'P²'.

The couple made their red carpet debut when they attended the Oscars together in February this year in Los Angeles.
