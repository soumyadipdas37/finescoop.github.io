Gemma Collins has furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat.'

The reality star, 39, proved she's had the last laugh thanks to her own success as a fashion entrepreneur as she celebrated being voted TOWIE's Greatest Icon during its 10th Anniversary special.

Gemma has recently been flaunting the results of her three stone weight loss during an idyllic Greek getaway by sharing a slew of stylish snaps.

Defiant: Gemma Collins has furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat' as she celebrated being voted TOWIE's Number One Icon

In pre-recorded video that aired during TOWIE's anniversary special on Sunday, Gemma thanked fans for voting her the show's Number One Icon.

She added: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body.

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand. So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?'

Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.

She went onto share the video with her fans on Instagram, writing the caption: 'Thank you SO MUCH No 1 I.C.O.N. 

'The show holds such dear memories for me and I will never forget that if it wasn’t for TOWIE I would not be where I am today!! 

'I love the fans so much and here’s to another wonderful ten years of TOWIE i love you all the TOWIE fans and just remember BE YOU ✌ thank you TOWIE and congrats to all.'

Candid: She told her followers: 'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat'

Gemma has been showing off the recent results of her three stone weight loss after recently returning from a sunny getaway to Greece.

It comes after reports that Gemma is set to cash in with a mega bucks deal with fashion brand In The Style.

The deal follows the huge success of her meme collection with the retailer, with big names including Little Mix's Jade Thirwall seen wearing clothes from the range.

The blonde apparently raked in £100,000 in just one day earlier this year through sales of her new sweatshirt after Jade was spotted wearing one.

In The Style reportedly flew the TOWIE favourite to the Greek island to get snaps of her latest clothing range.

And Gemma did little to stop the chatter in the caption to a stunning Instagram snap of her rocking a leopard print midi dress.   

The TV personality wrote: 'She turned her cants into cans and dreams into plans. Big things coming with @inthestyle! 

'Whilst I've been in Greece I've been shooting something exciting that I've been working on for months... can't wait to show you more.' 

Wow! Gemma has been showing off the recent results of her three stone weight loss after recently returning from a sunny getaway to Greece
