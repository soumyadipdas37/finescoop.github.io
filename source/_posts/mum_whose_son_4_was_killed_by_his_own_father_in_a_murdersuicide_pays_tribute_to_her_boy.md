The mother of a little boy who was killed at the hands of his own father in a tragic murder-suicide has issued a gut-wrenching message dedicated to her son.

Natsuko Kurihara wrote that her 'beautiful son' Koah was killed by his dad Troy Harvey on Friday and begged her son to forgive her, saying 'I'm so sorry I couldn't save you'.

Paramedics and police called to the horrific scene worked for an hour to try and save the boy's life after officers were called to a property in the town of Rossville, north of Cairns, just before 10am on Friday morning. 

'My beautiful boy Koah, he has had only four years of life, this has been taken by his father. He then took his own life,' Ms Kurihara posted on Saturday.

'I'm in pain life is not fair.'

'Let the people you love know you love them as they can be taken from you.

'I'm so sorry Koah l couldn't save you. Love you forever.' 

Detective Acting Inspector Jason Smith told The Cairns Post, 'they worked on him for a significant period of time.' 

He is one of a number of detectives who are specialist officers who are travelling to the remote town on the Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland about 30km north of Cooktown, on Saturday.

A crime scene has been established and detectives have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Harvey, 46, and the boy. 

'We're treating it seriously and looking at all possibilities. We'll have a total of eight detectives and we're seeking to speak to anyone who had any information about the family,' Dect Insp Smith said. 

Cook Shire Mayor Peter Scott described the incident as 'terrible' and offered his commiserations to the family and friends.

Pictures posted online appear to show the suspected killer as a loving, doting father. 

But the fisherman at the centre of heartbreaking tragedy who also taught boxercise at a nearby gym in Rossville, may have offered some insight into his mental state about one month earlier.
