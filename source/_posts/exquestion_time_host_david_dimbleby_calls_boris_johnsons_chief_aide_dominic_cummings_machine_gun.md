David Dimbleby has described Dominic Cummings as 'a machine gun' prepared to 'massacre' British institutions like the BBC and judiciary.

The former Question Time host also took aim at 'arrogant' Boris Johnson, saying 'a strong-willed prime minister' does not depend on 'powers behind the throne' like Mr Cummings.

Mr Dimbleby, 81, said 'there is something obnoxious' about Downing Street's chief adviser Mr Cummings. 

He told The Times: 'All prime ministers have had gurus, but I find this Cummings thing deeply offensive…that whole business about Barnard Castle was really offensive.'

'There is something obnoxious about him,' he added. 'He's like a machine gun. Remember the Battle of Omdurman. 

'The army just massacred a whole row of people on top of the hill and you feel like that at the moment.

'It's not that easy to dismantle things, shrinking the BBC, getting rid of all the senior people in the civil service, attacking the judiciary. 

'It is the Bash Street Kids but to what end?'

He also said politicians these days shy away from scrutiny and think 'what's in it for me?'.

'To say when you get to the top, ''I am not going to be interviewed'', like Boris Johnson did at the last election, is so arrogant… it doesn't make you a shrewd operator. 

'It erodes the democratic process.'
