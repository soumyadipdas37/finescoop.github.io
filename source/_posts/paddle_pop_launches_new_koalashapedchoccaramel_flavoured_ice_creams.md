Australia's iconic ice-cream brand Streets has launched a brand new range of koala-shaped choc-caramel flavoured Paddle Pops.

The brand has teamed up with wildlife rescue organisation WIRES at the new Sydney Zoo to help rebuild the koala population following the devastating bushfire season that saw a 71 per cent decline for the animals.

And so Streets has unveiled the new Koala Paddle Pop - complete with a combination of chocolate and caramel, made with Australian dairy.

'We're a local brand, who want to ensure we're doing our part for our local heroes,' Annie Lucchitti, Paddle Pop brand manager, said.

'This is why we're proud to partner with an organisation who actively strives to support our Aussie wildlife like WIRES do.

'We wanted to create our new Koala Paddle Pop to help raise awareness of koala conservation among Aussie families - and what better way to support these cuddly creatures than with an ice cream in your hand.'

WIRES CEO Leanne Taylor said the koala populations have seen a dramatic decline over the last five to ten years.

'Raising awareness for koala conservation is now more crucial than ever. We're thrilled to have the support of Paddle Pop to help drive conversation and educate more Australian families of this important cause,' she said.

'Paddle Pop's support is a great combination of long-term initiatives, education and practical planning for the upcoming summer season and rebuilding koala populations into the future.'

The two-year commitment will see Paddle Pop support three WIRES projects such as Koala Rehabilitation Facilities, Koala Health Hub and the Water Drinkers Project.

The new Koala Paddle Pop is available from Monday, September 7 in convenience and petrol stores across Australia and in Coles and IGA from the end of the month.
