Angry locals in Devon have left stinking dead fish on the windscreen of a 'rudely parked' £120,000 Aston Martin. 

The sports car, believed to be a V8 Vantage, was spotted on September 3 parked in the private spaces of Salcombe fish quay.

The flashy Aston Martin racked up two separate parking tickets from the council, as it was thought to have been left there for quite some time.

Signs behind the 'ignorantly' parked car state that the spaces are not to be used by members of the public.

It reads: 'Reserved parking for fisherman only.'

The car had been blocked in by a barrel containing chains, which weigh up to half a tonne, as well as having dead fish flung on to it. 

The model of the luxury sports car reportedly costs around £124,000.

The sports car has allegedly disappeared after being parked in the private space for a number of days.
