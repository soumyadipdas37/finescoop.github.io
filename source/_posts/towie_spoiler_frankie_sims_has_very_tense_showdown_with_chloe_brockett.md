They've been locked in a bitter feud over Harry Lee.

And Chloe Brockett and Frankie Sims are set to engage in a very tense showdown over rumours of Chloe and Harry's 'flirty' behaviour at a past event that have swirled around Essex.  

In an teaser for the upcoming episode on Wednesday night Chloe, 19, finally comes face-to-face with Frankie, 25, to get to the bottom of what happened that night.

Disagreement: Chloe Brockett and Frankie Sims (pictured) are set to engage in a very tense showdown over rumours of Chloe and Harry Lee's 'flirty' behaviour in Wednesday's TOWIE

Clearly agitated while trying to defend her relationship with the footballer, Frankie says to Chloe: 'He's good to me, I ain't insecure and he don't control me, so don't put words into my relationship.' 

The girls have been at loggerheads ever since Frankie and Harry embarked on their romance earlier this year, after Chloe also briefly dated him before Christmas.

In Wednesday's episode Harry also tries to diffuse any tension and reassures Frankie that he was not flirting with Chloe and he 'can't believe she would even suggest it'. 

Tense: In an teaser for the upcoming episode on Wednesday night Chloe, 19, finally comes face-to-face with Frankie, 25, to get to the bottom of what happened that night

It comes after Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 19, came under fire once again on Sunday's TOWIE, as they were hit with more accusations of bullying Chloe. 

Viewers took to Twitter to describe how they felt 'uncomfortable' watching the trio throw insults at their much younger cast mate.

The row first occurred when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex boyfriend, Jack McDermott.

During the row, insults were thrown by both Chloe and mainly Olivia as Yazmin Oukhellou watched awkwardly on the sidelines. 

When Chloe asked Olivia why she called her a 'poisonous little creature', the former Love Island star replied: 'I thought you was vile and poisonous. You went at Clelia last year like a Jack Russell.

'I do feel a bit sorry for you, you haven't got any friends your own age, you're hanging around girls a lot older than you and you're angry. I don't know why you're so angry but you are. 

'The thing is I thought the other day "maybe was what I said a little bit too harsh" but the way you've conducted yourself, I'm bang on.'

'Three witches': It comes after Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 19, came under fire once again on Sunday's TOWIE, as they were hit with more accusations of bullying Chloe

Chloe told her: 'All I'm saying is, when you called me a 'poisonous little creature', you don't know me'.

Olivia interrupted: 'I do know you, I know loads about you. I've seen the way you treated my friend.  

'Your mum Claire what does she pay you an hour to babysit you? Because I would like to know', to which the other two girls sniggered.   

The argument reached fever pitch when they continued to throw insults about each others' age, Chloe calling Olivia a 'lanky old troll' while Nicole called Chloe 'young' and 'stupid'. 

Olivia went further: 'You come here with Victoria Beckham's wig on'.

Upsetting scenes: Viewers took to Twitter to describe how they felt 'uncomfortable' watching the trio throw insults at their much younger castmate Chloe 

Viewers were outraged by the scenes. One wrote: 'This is three on one, and that’s disgusting promoting bullying behaviour regardless to if Chloe B is in the right or the wrong. Three people are attacking her I don’t blame her for reacting the way she does.'  

MailOnline contacted ITV and Olivia, Nicole and Clelia's representatives for comment.   

Earlier this week, Chloe addressed bullying claims on Twitter, after fans raised their concerns.

The reality star wrote: 'I know there's a lot of talk atm about me being bullied, I appreciate everyone's concern, however this is a show and everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I am completely FINE. Towie would not allow bullying to go on and always put our welfare first.' 

Elsewhere on the upcoming episode Clelia is left frustrated with Bobby Norris after comments he made towards her while Saffron acts as a mediator to try and bring the pair back together. 

Meanwhile Olivia Attwood contemplates her future in Essex as she considers moving back to Manchester full-time to be closer to her fiance Bradley Dack. 

Yazmin Oukhellou, 26 and James Lock's rekindled romance continues going from strength-to-strength, as Yaz pens a romantic poem showing her appreciation for Lockie.

Elsewhere, Diags enlists the help of Chloe Sims to fulfil his bucket list before he turns 30.
