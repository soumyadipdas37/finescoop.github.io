The mother-of-four marked her birthday after a 'very difficult year' - with the global pandemic and her country's lockdown resulting in some days that 'seemed to last a lifetime' for the royal.

Speaking to Hello!, Queen Rania said: 'It has been a very difficult year, but I am thankful that my country is doing all it can to limit the spread of Covid-19 within our borders and put our people’s health and wellbeing first.'

Last week, Jordan reimposed some restrictions and extended curfew hours in response to increasing coronavirus outbreaks.

‘Throughout this global crisis, there have been days that seemed to last a lifetime, followed by months that flew by in a haze,’ the royal admitted.

When revealing her birthday wish this year, she said: ‘On my birthday, as long as the people I love are nearby, and they are healthy and safe, I could not possibly ask for more.’
