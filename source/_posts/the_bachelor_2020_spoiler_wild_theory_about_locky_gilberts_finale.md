The long-awaited season finale of The Bachelor Australia, starring Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert, is just two days away.

And rumours are swirling that Locky's ending is going to be so chaotic, it will make Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins' last episode look like a fairytale by comparison.

Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that the former Australian Survivor star, 31, is rejected by his winner, and then begs his heartbroken runner-up for another chance.

No way! A wild theory has surfaced about the upcoming finale of The Bachelor - and it could be even more unexpected than Honey Badger's ending. Pictured: Locky Gilbert breaks down in tears and says 'f**king hell' in a trailer for the season finale

As fans will know, Irena Srbinovska is the bookies' favourite to steal Locky's heart - but insiders are saying that she isn't the clear-cut victor like in previous seasons.

If the rumours are to be believed, Locky actually dumps Irena and chooses Bella Varelis in the finale - but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena.

He then makes a sudden about-turn and begs the 31-year-old nurse to take him back, and she tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him.

Wild: Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that Locky, 31, is rejected by his winner, and then begs his heartbroken runner-up for another chance. Promos for the season appear to support this, as Locky admits he has fallen in love with both his finalists

These rumours are still unconfirmed, however, and the actual outcome of The Bachelor remains a closely guarded industry secret.

But it's interesting that this ending seems to correlate with trailers for the series, which promise a finale 'you won't believe' as Locky is forced to choose between two women he has fallen in love with.

The show's executive producer, Hilary Inness, actually hinted at a Honey Badger-style ending in an interview with Media Week last month.

Bombshell: This theory seems to correlate with trailers for the series, which promise a finale 'you won't believe' as Locky is forced to choose between two women he has fallen in love with

'Locky, by his own admission, falls in love with more than one girl,' Ms Inness said.

'Famously the Honey Badger couldn't choose someone, and now we have a Bachelor who has fallen in love with more than one girl, which is a first for us.'

For those who didn't watch the 2018 season of The Bachelor, rugby union player Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins infamously chose no one during his finale.

The Bachelor finale week begins Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
