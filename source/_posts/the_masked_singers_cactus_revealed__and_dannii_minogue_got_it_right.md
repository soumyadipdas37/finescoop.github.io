On Monday night's episode of The Masked Singer Australia, the celebrity inside the Cactus costume was revealed. 

And it was none other than actress, singer and stage performer, Lucy Durack, best known for starring in the stage musical Wicked. 

Judge Dannii Minogue guessed it right, and was absolutely delighted to realise she yet again had the correct pick.  

Who is it! On Monday night's episode of The Masked Singer Australia, the celebrity inside the Cactus costume was finally revealed

Lucy wasn't at all upset at being voted out, jumping up and down and beaming when she pulled off the mask. 

The 37-year-old, who performed Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart, said she is a Masked Singer fangirl. 

She told host Osher Gunsberg: 'Oh! I was such a fan of the show. I did not miss one episode last year. 

Off with her head! The crowd chanted ahead of the big reveal as the mask came off

She added: 'When you're behind the mask, it's so much fun 'cause you've kind of got this freedom to just have a go. 

'I got to sing so many songs that I never would've thought I would've had a go at. I'm normally singing, you know, all musical theatre'. 

Lucy said she was keeping her appearance on the show a secret from her five-year-old daughter Polly and could not wait to tell her what she's been up to.  

Loves it! The 37-year-old, who performed Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart, said she is a Masked Singer fangirl. She told host Osher Gunsberg, 'Oh! I was such a fan of the show. I did not miss one episode last year!' 

'I can't wait for my daughter, Polly, to see that it's me. Polly! Um, this is where I've been when I've been going to work!' 

Explaining why one of her clues was a golf club, Lucy joked that she didn't spend much time golfing - it was a reference to one of her musical theatre performances.  

Lucy joked: 'Look, I'm not a secret golfer, but you'll notice that the club is a wood and I played Elle Woods in Legally Blonde the musical!' 

The Masked Singer continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
