To debut her new 'do, Dannii shared a video of herself strutting down a hallway to her sister Kylie Minogue's song 'Say Something', dressed in a sequin dress and her face shield on. 

Contrasting her shimmering frock was her wavy bright pink, shoulder-length hair, which bounced on her shoulders.

For makeup, her flawless visage was teamed with a bold smokey eye and matte pink lips.

The All I Wanna So hitmaker wrote in the caption: 'Winding up for a big semifinal tonight.'
