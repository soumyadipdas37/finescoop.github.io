The spectacular glass villa, known as 'The Curve', is nestled north of Brighton and boasts breathtaking views across the East Sussex countryside thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows throughout its five bedrooms. 

The Curve is a rare find on the UK property market, costing owner Barry Surtees £1.8million to build back in 2007, but he put it up for sale three years later to try and recoup some of the costs.
