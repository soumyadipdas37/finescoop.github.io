Donald Trump Jr has hit back at the bombshell report suggesting his father has been paying little or no federal income tax for years, saying most Americans 'don't understand' running a business.

The executive of the Trump Organization defended the President after The New York Times claimed he paid no income tax in 11 of the 18 years studied, and only $750 in 2016 and 2017.

The tax records show Trump is also carrying a total of $421 million in loans and debt that are primarily due within four years. 

His eldest child appeared on Fox and Friends on Monday to rebuff the claims and instead suggested people were better off looking into Joe Biden's son Hunter's financial dealings.

Downplaying the company's huge reported losses and minimal tax contribution, Trump Jr said: 'It's ridiculous, my father has paid tens of millions of taxes.

'If he does things in certain years where you get depreciation, where you get write-off, where you get historical tax credits like we did when we took on the risk of building the old Post Office in DC, that was literally a government contract.'

The General Services Administration leased the historic building to a consortium headed by DJT Holdings LLC, a holding company that Trump owns through a revocable trust. 

The Old Post Office hotel qualified for a historic-preservation tax break.

Trump Jr continued: 'We bid against every hotel company in the world, historical tax credits that you use to offset tax payments for taking the risk to build that. That was done under the Obama administration.

'It literally took an act of Congress to get it done. So with that comes historical tax credits. That's the reality. People don't understand what goes into a business.

'It doesn't include property taxes, it doesn't include payroll taxes, it doesn't include real estate taxes, it doesn't include so many of the things he's been paying taxes on for ever as he's also putting thousands and thousands of people to work on an annual basis.'

He then turned his attack towards the journalists who broke the story and said they should redirect their efforts towards the Biden family.

The businessman said the New York Times deliberately published the story just days before the first election debate to give Biden an advantage.

'If only they spent as much time looking for Hunter Biden's tax returns and the Biden crime family issues, where Hunter's taking money from a known associate of Vladimir Putin, $3.5million and no one has any interest.

'Money that's linked to human trafficking and prostitution rings in Eastern Europe, think about that. Imagine I did that. Imagine the story it would be.' 

Responding to the report Sunday evening Trump told reporters: 'It's totally fake news'

Trump Jr was referring to a report released last week which suggested Hunter had a 'financial relationship' with the widow of a Moscow mayor who was ousted over corruption allegations.

The 87-page report was released on Wednesday by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee, and focuses on Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.

The report did not implicate Joe Biden in wrongdoing, focusing instead on his son Hunter, who it said 'cashed in' on his father's position by joining the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

It also states that on Valentine's Day in 2014, Hunter Biden's company Rosemont Seneca Thornton received a $3.5million wire from Elena Baturina, a Russian billionaire and the widow of former Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.

In 2010, Russia's president fired Luzhkov as mayor over corruption allegations, which were never proven in court prior to his death last year.

Baturina, with an estimated fortune of $1.2 billion, is the richest woman in Russia. Much of her fortune was built with construction firm Inteco, which dominated the construction business in Moscow, thanks in part to lucrative government contracts.

Biden's campaign said the investigation was founded on 'a long-disproven, hardcore rightwing conspiracy theory' and, even before the report was released, issued a detailed statement aiming to rebut point-by-point allegations that it said had long been debunked by media organizations as well as by U.S. and Ukrainian officials.  

TRUMP PAID JUST $750 IN TAXES IN BOTH 2016 and 2017.

The newspaper said Trump initially paid $95 million in taxes over the 18 years it studied. But he managed to recover most of that money by claiming — and receiving — a stunning $72.9 million federal tax refund. 

According to the Times, Trump also pocketed $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which are typically based on federal filings.

Trump’s outsize refund became the subject of a now-long-standing Internal Revenue Service audit of his finances. The audit was widely known. Trump has claimed it was the very reason why he cannot release his returns. But the Times report is the first to identify the issue that was mainly in dispute.

As a result of the refund, Trump paid an average $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2000 to 2017, the Times reported. By contrast, the average U.S. taxpayer in the top .001% of earners paid about $25 million annually over the same time-frame.

TRUMP HAS FINANCED AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE WITH THE USE OF BUSINESS EXPENSES

From his homes, his aircraft — and $70,000 on hair styling during his television show “The Apprentice” — Trump has capitalized on cost incurred from his businesses to finance a luxurious lifestyle.

The Times noted that Trump’s homes, planes and golf courses are part of the Trump family business and, as such, Trump classified them as business expenses as well. Because companies can write off business expenses as deductions, all such expenses have helped reduce Trump’s tax liability.

MANY OF HIS BEST-KNOWN BUSINESSES ARE MONEY-LOSERS

The president has frequently pointed to his far-flung hotels, golf courses and resorts as evidence of his success as a developer and businessman. Yet these properties have been been draining money.

The Times reported that Trump has claimed $315 million in losses since 2000 on his golf courses, including the Trump National Doral near Miami, which Trump has portrayed as a crown jewel in his business empire. Likewise, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has lost $55 million, the Times reported.

FOREIGN VISITORS HAVE HELPED SUPPORT TRUMP’S PROPERTIES

Since Trump began his presidential run, lobbyists, foreign governments and politicians have lavished significant sums of money on his properties, a spending spree that raised questions about its propriety and legality.

The Times report illustrates just how much that spending has been: Since 2015, his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has taken in $5 million more a year from a surge in membership. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association spent at least $397,602 in 2017 at Trump’s Washington hotel. Overseas projects have produced millions more for Trump — $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.

TRUMP WILL FACE FINANCIAL PRESSURE AS DEBTS COME DUE

Trump seems sure to face heavy financial pressures from the enormous pile of debt he has absorbed. The Times said the president appears to be responsible for $421 million in loans, most of which will come due within four years. On top of that, a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower in New York will come due in 2022.
