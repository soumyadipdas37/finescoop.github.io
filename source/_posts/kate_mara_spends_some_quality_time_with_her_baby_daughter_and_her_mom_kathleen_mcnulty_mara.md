Kate Mara was spotted out on Friday as she enjoyed some time together with her baby daughter and her mother Kathleen McNulty Mara.

The 37-year-old actress and sports dynasty heiress made a trip to a park in Los Angeles where she and her mother could play with her 15-month-old daughter, whose name hasn't been publicly revealed yet.

The Chappaquiddick star showed off her legs and highlighted her cleavage in a burgundy dress that was lit up by tiny white flower designs.

Kate paired the short dress with a classic denim jacket, and she kept her footwear casual with gray sneakers.

The 5ft2in Pose actress carried a tan knit bag over one shoulder, and she blocked out the sun with a pair of round-frame sunglasses.

She was matched by her mother Kathleen, who wore a similarly patterned red dress and brought along a straw hat.

Kate's daughter played around in her playful stroller, which was designed to look like a red sports car.

She wore a cute white hat and a white patterned dress.

Although her daughter was too young to wear a mask, as they're not recommended for children under two, both Kate and her mother wore masks while out to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, though they took them off once they were away from others in the park.

Though much of Hollywood remains shutdown due to the pandemic, Kate recently resumed filming her limited series remake of Hannah Fidell's 2013 feature A Teacher.

The miniseries is about a young high school teacher who begins an affair with a student.

Kate shares her adorable daughter with her husband Jamie Bell, whom she married on July 17, 2017, after getting engaged in January of that year.

The two began dating in 2015 after starring in the ill-fated Fantastic Four reboot, which was critically derided and a bomb at the box office.

It's the second marriage for Bell, who shares a daughter with his ex-wife Evan Rachel Wood.

Though the couple announced their daughter's birth on Instagram, they've avoided using her name and have only ever shared a picture of her feet.

Family expansion: Kate's sister Rooney Mara is reportedly pregnant with her first child with fiancé Joaquin Phoenix; pictured at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles in February 2020

Kate's sister Rooney, 35, appears to be ready for her own child, as she has been spotted around LA trying to obscure her own baby bump.

So far, neither she nor her fiancé Joaquin Phoenix have confirmed the pregnancy.

A source told Page Six that she could have been as far as six months along at the time, although she often wears baggy clothing that makes it difficult to tell.
