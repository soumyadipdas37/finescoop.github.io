Kaia Gerber has been spending time with her new flame Jacob Elordi, since they were spotted together earlier this month.

And the legacy model appears to be getting close with the Australian actor, as he already seems to be part of the family.

She showed off her toned bod Saturday in a green printed bikini, as she cuddled up to her new beau, while they vacationed with her famous brood in Los Cabos, Mexico.

The 19-year-old complemented the two-piece tie-dye string bikini with a tan fedora and some chunky brown ombré sunglasses.

She was spotted wrapping her arms around the Kissing Booth star, 23, as they relaxed in the outdoor spa.

Jacob donned a pair of grey shorts, before changing into some black swim trunks and taking a dip with Kaia.

He showed off his washboard abs in the swimwear, which he accessorized with a pair of wayfarers and a blue baseball cap. 

Also on Jacob and Kaia's tropical Mexican getaway were her supermodel parents Cindy Crawford, 54, and Rande Gerber, 58.

The pair was first seen out to dinner together earlier this month at the upscale seaside sushi spot Nobu Malibu. 

A source told E! News at the time that their relationship was mostly platonic: 'Jacob definitely has interest in dating Kaia, but there is nothing serious going on there.

'They have many mutual friends and have hung out many times in the past. They both have very chill personalities and similar interests. Jacob makes Kaia laugh and her family adores him.'

The insider added: 'Kaia is keeping things friendly for now but there is flirtation between the two. She has told friends she is single and is only having fun and hanging out with people.'
