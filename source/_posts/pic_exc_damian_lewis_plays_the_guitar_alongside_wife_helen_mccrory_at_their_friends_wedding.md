Damian Lewis showcased his musical side as he pulled out a guitar to perform at his friends' wedding, held at Kensington and Chelsea Register Office in London on Thursday.

The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star, 49, was joined by his actress wife Helen McCrory, 52, as they celebrated the occasion by singing along to a series of classic Irish tracks. 

As ceremonies and receptions in England set to be capped at 15 people from Monday, the screen stars' pals were able to narrowly avoid the new restrictions as they marked their milestone with their loved ones.

The Band of Brothers star put on a dapper display as he was dressed in a dark blue suit, teamed with a white shirt and a patterned tie.

Damian couldn't contain his delight as he congratulated the newlyweds while strumming the keys of his instrument.

Peaky Blinders' Helen, meanwhile, cut a sophisticated figure in a polka dot blouse, high-waisted trousers and a wool coat.

The mother-of-two's right arm was held up in a sling, nearly a year after she used a scarf to support the same limb during a night out. MailOnline has contacted Helen's representatives for further comment.

Wedding ceremonies and receptions in England are to be restricted to just 15 people - half of the current guidelines - as part of new coronavirus measures to curb a surge in cases.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson added that funeral services would be exempt from the limitations, with the maximum number of mourners remaining at 30. 

Setting out the measures in the House of Commons, the politician, 56, said: 'Fifth, now is the time to tighten up the rule of six.

'I'm afraid that from Monday a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions, though up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now.'

Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions were included in a list of exemptions to the ban on social gatherings of more than six.   

Current guidance states that up to 30 attendees are permitted in Wales, while in Scotland, ceremonies and receptions are limited to 20 people, and numbers are dependent on the venue in Northern Ireland.  

In March, Damian joked he finally knows what fellow thespian Helen looked like as they self-isolated together in their Suffolk home amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The duo were asked how they were coping with life in quarantine, in contrast to their typically busy schedules during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. 

Homeland actor Damian quipped: 'I know, it’s amazing! I had no idea [Helen] looked like that!' 

The celebrity couple, who have been married for 13 years, raise their two children, 13-year-old daughter Manon and son Gulliver, 12, at their home in north London.

Helen previously revealed to the Radio Times that when she met the flame-haired actor, it had been love at first sight.

'He just made me laugh a lot. And still does,' she gushed of her longtime partner. 'Of course, everyone in life wants someone to love and be loved by, but I think I was always just engrossed and involved in work.

'And no, the timing was pure fluke, pure chance, it always is, isn’t it?'
