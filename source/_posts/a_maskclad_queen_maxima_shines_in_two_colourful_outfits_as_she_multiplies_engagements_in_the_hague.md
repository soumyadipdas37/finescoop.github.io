Queen Maxima delighted royal fans with two colourful outfits for several engagements in the Hague, today. 

The Dutch queen, 49, first wore a hot pink dress to mark the start of Breast Cancer Awareness month at the World Forum. 

She then performed a quick outfit change into a stunning orange pleated gown with a matching head band, before heading to the anniversary of the Social and Economic Council. 

Busy Maxima looked stylish for both occasions, and wore a face mask, in keeping with guidelines put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

This morning, Maxima marked the beginning of October, which is traditionally Breast Cancer Awareness month. 

As she was handed a book titled 'Everything about breast cancer,' the royal looked stylish in a hot pink dress, which she matched with magenta accessories.  

Her colourful dress was beautifully draped at the shoulder and its fitted waist highlighted the royal's trim figure. 

Partial to a colour block look, Maxima wore accessories of the same shade , from a magenta jacket which she casually carried on her arm to a Nubuck leather clutch with a golden chain, which hung at her wrist and a large raffia hat - a staple of her wardrobe.

She was wearing a pair of dark red statement earrings underneath the hat.  

She also donned a pair of leather gloves of the same colour, which she briefly took off to sanitise her hands as she stepped inside the World Forum for the event.  

Her golden locks bounced on her shoulders, styled in a bouncy blow-dry. With half her face protected by her black mask, she put the focus on her hazelnut eyes with a dash of mascara and eyeliner. 

There, she met with volunteers and cancer patients to discuss their experience of cancer symptoms, treatment and detection.

The Hague's Social and Economical Council (Sociaal-Economische Raad, in Dutch, or SER) is one of the major architects of the Dutch Economical system. 

It represents social partners trade unions as well as employers around the country through sector-based regulatory bodies.

Created to avoid another Great Recession following the Economic crash of 1929 and the second World War, the Council holds three main goals; promoting balanced and sustainable economic growth, full employment and fair income distribution.  

It was first created in 1950, making 2020 its 70th year of existence, which Maxima celebrated in style.
