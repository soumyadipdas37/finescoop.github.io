Diego Costa and Luis Suarez, two of the great footballing villains to play at centre-forward, have united at Atletico Madrid - and they can't contain their excitement.   

The pair teamed-up for the first time on Sunday night after Suarez's £5.5m move from Barcelona, as Atletico Madrid dismantled Granda 6-1 in their opening LaLiga fixture of the season. 

Suarez replaced Costa in the 71st minute after the Spaniard fired-in the opener after six minutes, only for Suarez to bag a double and add an assist inside his first 25 minutes at the club.

Suarez and Costa are both controversial characters and will certainly stir up trouble together

Both men have a controversial past and have made a habit of riling-up rival fans through their antics. Despite both men having broken into their 30s, it could be an explosive forward line. 

'It's great. One bites and the other kicks,' the former Chelsea striker said after thrashing Granada. 

'We are very lucky to have Luis, I don't understand how Barca could have let him leave.

Costa opened the scoring for Atletico on just six minutes before Atletico continued their rout

'He's going to help us with lots of goals as well as his warrior spirit and his hunger to win trophies. 

'I hope he can help us win another trophy for our fans, but we need to take each game as it comes.'  

Suarez cemented himself in Barcelona history by slotting in at third in their all-time scorers list, but he's not done yet. 

The Uruguayan smashed in 16 goals and contributed eight assists in LaLiga last season despite a knee surgery taking a dent out of his season.
