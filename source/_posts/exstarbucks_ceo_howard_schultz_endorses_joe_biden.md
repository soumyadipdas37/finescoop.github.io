Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz officially backed Democratic nominee Joe Biden, sending out a note to former supporters Monday morning. 

Schultz had briefly thought about running for president as an independent, but came to the conclusion that he might play 'spoiler' and help re-elect President Donald Trump. 

'In my view, our choice this November is not just for one candidate over another. We are choosing to vote for the future of our republic,' Schultz wrote, according to Fox Business. 'What is at risk is democracy itself: Checks and balances. Rigorous debate. A free press. An acceptance of facts, not "alternate facts." Belief in science. Trust in the rule of law.' 

Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Monday that he was officially backing Democrat Joe Biden, writing that this year's election was about 'choosing to vote for the future of our republic' 

Joe Biden, speaking Monday about climate change in Wilmington, Delaware, has attracted the support of a number of billionaires including Schultz, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, all who are using their cash to help him win the election over President Donald Trump 

Schultz referenced Trump's statements to his supporters, sowing doubt about the legitimacy of mail-in voting, something Democats have pushed amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

The ex-coffee boss wrote that it's 'essential that Americans turn out to vote, that every American is able to vote safely, whether by mail or in person, and that every vote is counted.'  

'It would be a grave miscalculation to think this election is secured for a Biden victory,' Schultz added.   

Schultz, whose estimated worth is more than $4 billion, said he was 'supporting nonpartisan initiatives to defend the legitimacy of our elections and ensure that the winner is not declared in the presidential contest until all votes are tallied.'  

His commitment to the Democratic hopeful follows the announcement that Michael Bloomberg, the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat ex-New York City mayor who briefly ran for president earlier this year, will toss at least $100 million in cash toward Biden flipping Florida. 

The Sunshine State was among the handful of states that had voted for President Barack Obama and then won the Electoral College for Trump. 

And in May, Biden scored the commitment of $45 million from Democrat Tom Steyer's NextGen America group, according to U.S. New & World Report. 

Those funds have been more recently tailored to go toward helping young voters understand the mail-in balloting process. 

Steyer, like Schultz, came from the business world, though decided to actually run for president. 

He spent $200 million of his own money to launch a bid that saw him drop out after the South Carolina primary in late February, putting his weight behind Biden.
