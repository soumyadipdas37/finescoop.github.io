Sean Peek, pictured, was found unresponsive late Sunday morning; the cause of death is pending

A veteran New Jersey cop died hours after jumping into a river to save a suspect fleeing from the scene of a burglary.  

Sean Peek, 49, had responded to a burglary call in the early hours of Sunday morning at an ambulance station when he saw the woman, identified by police as Sarah Jeanne Davis, 29, either fall or jump into the Cohansey River. 

The Bridgeton Police Department officer then followed the suspect into the water before being pulled out by other officers and taken to hospital, where he was released to go home. 

Peek, who was a married father-of-one, joined the force 15 years ago. He was found unresponsive late Sunday morning; the cause of death is pending. 

Davis made it across the river and was arrested, police said. 

Police Chief Michael Gaimari Sr. said Monday: 'Sean made a decision as would any officer and entered to water in [an] attempt to pull the person from the running waters no matter what the circumstances.

'The woman eventually made it across the river but Officer Peek had difficulty making it back to shore as he was still donning all of his equipment and gear.'

Gaimari added: 'We are naturally devastated here at the department. 

'Sean was a fine officer and a friend to all and always acted in an exemplary fashion when representing the department and the City of Bridgeton.

'He will be sorely missed and our hearts collectively go out to Megan and their eight-year-old daughter, Kate.'

Davis, of Canton, Connecticut, was arrested on a burglary charge. 

She stands accused of breaking into the ambulance station, damaging property.
