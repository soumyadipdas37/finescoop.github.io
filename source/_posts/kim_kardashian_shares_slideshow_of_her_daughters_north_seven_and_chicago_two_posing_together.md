Kim Kardashian shared an adorable slideshow of her seven-year-old daughter, North West, teaching her younger sister Chicago, two, how to 'make a peace sign.' 

After posing for a few shots with her lookalike sibling tenderly holding onto her, the eldest of Kim and Kanye West's four children looked ready to pass down her wisdom.

In a precious exchange, the doting big sister could be seen attempting to show little  Chi how to mimic her signature pose.

'My girls,' the 39-year-old SKIMS founder gushed of her darling daughters, who were playing in the grass. 'Swipe to see North trying to teach Chi to make a peace sign.'  

While Chicago didn't quite master North's go-to gesture, at one point she hilariously crossed her arms and displayed her impressive eye contact with the camera. 

While the tot wore an all-black ensemble, North showcased her 'distinct fashion sense,' which was previously lauded by WWD Beauty Inc on her first cover shoot in 2019.

The sister duo appeared to enjoying some quality time away from their brothers Saint, four, and one-year-old Psalm. 

Kardashian's slideshow comes just one day after her husband left fans concerned with a disturbing tweet about having his eldest daughter taken away from him. 

The 43-year-old rapper, whose mental health issues have been well documented, posted and then deleted the worrying message which was addressed to his seven-year-old, early on Friday morning.

'NORTHY I AM GOING TO WAR AND PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE AND IF I AM MURDERED DON'T EVER LET WHITE MEDIA TELL YOU I WASNT A GOOD MAN... WHEN PEOPLE THREATEN TO TAKE YOU OUT OF MY LIFE JUST KNOW I LOVE YOU.' the designer wrote. 

Along with the message Kanye shared a photo of North looking playful and throwing up two peace signs.

Although the Faded hitmaker quickly deleted the post, concerned fans rallied round to express their fears for the star.

'He needs help ya'll. Real Help. Stop feeding into this.:(' came another concerned message.

Another fan re-posted Kanye's tweet and wrote: '@kanywest just posted & deleted this, I'm worrrieddd.' 

Disturbing: Kanye West posted and deleted this message on Twitter early on Friday morning

A source recently told People that Kanye is 'off his meds' and wife Kim is 'at the end of her rope - again'.

'The last time, part of his negotiation with Kim was that he'd get back on his medication and he would work very hard to control his impulses,' the source told the outlet. 'He made a lot of promises. And now those promises are broken, less than a month later.

'It's the same thing over and over and over again. He's on very thin ice with her right now, and she's truly trying to decide what to do to protect the kids, but also her own sanity.'

The source added that Kim 'wants to be a supportive partner, she's doing everything she can do to support him'. However, they add that Kanye has to support himself and take care of his own health.

'For such a powerful woman, she feels very powerless, and she hates it,' the source said. 'She loves Kanye very much, and he just doesn't realize how much pain he's causing her.'

Kanye first acknowledged his bipolar disorder in 2018, a condition that is associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs and can be controlled with medication.

Kim hinted last month that his struggle with bipolar was to blame for his recent erratic behavior, that has seen him embark on the unlikely bid for presidency and get emotional at his first campaign rally in South Carolina while discussing abortion.
