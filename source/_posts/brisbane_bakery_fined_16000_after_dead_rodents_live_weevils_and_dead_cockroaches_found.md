Rodents, dead cockroaches and live weevils were the horrifying finds made by council officers in the kitchen and storage room of a beloved bakery.

The Baked to Perfection bakery at Clayfield in Brisbane's inner-north was fined $16,000 on Thursday after a council officer spotted a live mouse running through the kitchen in January last year.

Two more dead rodents were found on a food shelf, live weevils were found in flour no longer being used and dead cockroaches were also spotted.

Kevin Kielly, the director who has run the well loved bakery for more than 50 years, was also fined $2,000.

Both the bakery and Mr Kielly pleaded guilty to nine charges each including offences relating to cleanliness and the presence of pests, the Courier Mail reported.

Rodent faeces were also spotted across the floor of the bakery that often catered to school and community events.

The Brisbane Magistrates Court heard on Friday that Mr Kielly had worked to fix the cleanliness issues within 24 hours and introduced better pest control management. 

Liza Marshall, who represented Mr Kielly, said he had been struggling since the death of his wife in March and his son who died in 2017 due to a brain tumour.

Mr Kielly had relied on his wife's nursing job financially and the bakery only made $11,686 in profit last financial year, Ms Marshall said.

The bakery forked out around $250,000 in staff and other expenses and Mr Kielly did not make a wage.

'It's a little local business that engages with and supports the community, including the local schools and the swimming club,' Ms Marshall said. 

Mr Kielly acknowledged that there were also holes in the bakery's ceiling which could have allowed for rodents to crawl inside.

The bakery which had never received a food complaint also provided discounted cakes to the local schools.

Magistrate Tina Previtera ordered Mr Kielly to pay $713 to the council but no convictions were recorded.
