Rochelle Humes has admitted she has been left with back aches after her breasts 'have grown' during her pregnancy.

The TV presenter, 31, is expecting her third child with husband Marvin Humes, 35, and has been coming to grips with the changes to her body.      

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday's Fabulous magazine, she said: 'These boobs have grown out of nowhere! They’re just massive! I don’t know what to do with them. I’ve got back ache constantly and I didn’t have that before.

Changes: Rochelle Humes, 31, has admitted she has been left with back aches after her breasts 'have grown' during her pregnancy

'With my first two pregnancies, my boobs grew, but not like this. This is a whole new thing. Even though it’s the third time, I’m definitely just getting used to this new body.'

Rochelle, who is due in October, joked that while she may have been suffering with the changes, her husband Marvin is pleased.  

She said: 'I mean, of course he’s pleased, but he needs to calm down.'

Rochelle and Marvin married in 2012 at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, and they share daughters Alaia-Mai, seven, and Valentina, three.

Marvin recently admitted he loves the fact that Rochelle earns more money than him during an appearance on Loose Women.

Taking part in a Soccer Aid for Unicef special on the show, dubbed Loose Women & Men, Marvin said: 'I'm buzzing that Roch earns more money than me. We're lucky with what we do, we've had a busy few weeks.

'Growing up, both my mum and dad did the same amount of hours, so I've grown up with my mum and dad earning equally. 

'It's nice for the girls seeing their mum doing so well and working so hard for what she wants, it's no problem at all.' 

She said: 'These boobs have grown out of nowhere! They’re just massive! I don’t know what to do with them. I’ve got back ache constantly and I didn’t have that before'

Rochelle recently told how she became emotional after eldest daughter Alaia started at a new school following the extended break during lockdown.

The TV presenter and singer, broke down in tears as she told her followers how she was feeling on Instagram. 

She said: 'A lot of change for us at the minute as a family - new house, new area but, the most change for my Alaia starting a brand new school after lockdown. 

'I’m so proud of how brave she is and so ready for a new adventure, so odd for me to not being able to go in and make sure she’s okay but I guess that’s the new "normal" for you.

'I held it together and as soon as the door shut I lost it. Being a parent is never easy...please tell me it’s not just me? She’s totally fine by the way and SO excited. I think I got more upset because Marv is away too'.
