It was announced just this month that the Scream franchise had finally secured its heroine Neve Campbell for the upcoming fifth go-round, but already, production has run into a snag.

Deadline reports that Scream 5, which has begun production in Wilmington, North Carolina, has seen three of its crew members recently test positive for the novel coronavirus.

Nonetheless, the shoot will resume as planned on Monday after the normal weekend break, as the infected set workers were not part of the primary 'pod' that includes the principal cast and crew.

The newest Scream film, which is welcoming back final girl Campbell along with beloved cast mates Courteney Cox and David Arquette, is adhering to a system now employed by most current productions in which designated pods of crew members and employees work in tandem on a project, but separately. 

The primary pod, in this case, includes the principal actors, directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, their assistants along with the director of photography and his or her team. 

The crew members who did test positive were surely from a secondary pod, such as the electrical/grip department, B-unit or craft services, for example.

According to Deadline, the affected employees will undergo a quarantine period and further testing, and rigorous contact tracing will also be carried out.

The latest Scream film, which is being touted as a reboot and is tentatively titled Scream 5, was recently pushed from a release date next year to January 14th, 2022.

The franchise as a whole has grossed over $600 million worldwide, ever since the first hit film turned the slasher genre on its ear in 1996 with wry direction from late horror master Wes Craven and a clever script from Kevin Williamson.

On September 10th, Scream fans were overjoyed to learn that Neve's rumored return to the series was in fact true, with her character Sidney Prescott gearing up to yet again face off against the Ghostface Killer.

Scream 5 directors Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett, along with their Radio Silence producing partner Chad Villella, released a statement on the casting, saying: 'We're pinching ourselves! It's hard to express how much the character Sidney Prescott shaped our love of movies and to have the chance to work with Neve is truly a dream come true.'

'It just wouldn’t be a 'Scream' movie without Neve and we’re so excited and honored to join her in Woodsboro.'

Meanwhile Neve herself also gave a statement, saying: 'After spending time speaking with Radio Silence, they have shown such love, respect and admiration for Wes Craven and all that he’s created in the ‘Scream’ franchise.'

She added: 'I am beyond excited to step back into the role of Sidney Prescott and return to Woodsboro.' 

Earlier this month as well, it was revealed that Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan's son Jack Quaid, 28, would be joining the cast, and Selena Gomez has also been rumored to be involved.
