Sydney Swans star Elijah Taylor has been arrested in Perth on Sunday. 

CCTV footage appeared to show Taylor being taken into custody by officers and put into a police vehicle in Langford, in the city's south east, at about 1.25pm. 

It’s understood Taylor is being questioned by police at Cannington police station, 7News reports. 

The teenager's manager said he is cooperating with police, but no charges have been laid. 

 Taylor, 19, is being investigated by his team the Sydney Swans and the AFL over the allegations made on social media

Lekahni Pearce (pictured) - the now ex-girlfriend of 18-year-old Sydney Swans rookie Elijah Taylor who snuck into his AFL quarantine hub - made domestic violence allegations against the young footy player

Taylor was suspended last month for the remainder of the 2020 season after sneaking his girlfriend Lekahni Pearce, 18, into the Swans' AFL quarantine hub accommodation at Perth's Joondalup Resort.

Earlier this month Ms Pearce made allegations of domestic violence against Taylor.

She also shared a photo of her bruised face and levelled a series of accusations against the rising star in an Instagram post. 

Ms Pearce alleged the acts took place three times in Sydney prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.   

'The allegations are extremely serious. The AFL has been in contact with local law enforcement and will continue to provide support and assistance for all,' the AFL said in a statement.
