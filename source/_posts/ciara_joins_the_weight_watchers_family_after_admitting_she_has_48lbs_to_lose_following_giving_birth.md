She admitted that while life 'couldn't be anymore hectic' with three children to watch, it was time for her to focus on her habits.

'It is time to get a system that's realistic, that's sustainable and one that I can do breastfeeding, and everything else going on — making my album, working and everything — it's a whole lot to juggle,' she said. 

'But I believe it's all possible and if I can have a plan ... I'm a woman of ambition on a mission and I want to make it happen. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm ready for it.'
