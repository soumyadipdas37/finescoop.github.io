Ireland Baldwin put on a sensational display as she showcased her incredible figure in a hot pink zebra print bikini on Friday.

The daughter of actors Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger oozed confidence as she strutted her stuff in the tiny two-piece while soaking up the sun in Malibu.

The 24-year-old model happily displayed her array of tattoos in the scoop neck top and high-legged bikini bottoms from PrettyLittleThing, which served to highlight her slender pins and toned midriff.

Ireland paired the sizzling swimwear with a simple pair of flip-flops, while she carried a denim dress in her hands.

She kept things simple by adding a gold hoop earrings and a dainty gold necklace. 

The Grudge Match star swept her blonde locks in a half up, half down style, while she showcased her natural beauty with a minimal make-up palette.

Ireland recently became a big sister again after her father Alec and his second wife Hilaria Baldwin welcomed their fifth child.

The couple added another son, Eduardo, to their brood of Carmen, seven, Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, Ireland posted a selfie to her Instagram which prompted a swift response from her mother.

Oscar-winning actress Kim expressed alarm after her only child showed off a small black heart-shape tattoo inked high on her cheekbone close to her right eye.

'You better not had......that’s all I can say..........,' she wrote in the comments section.

Ireland later clarified the image had been temporary, sharing a clip to Instagram Story in which she smudged it and rubbed it away.

Last month, Ireland celebrated being six years free from eating disorders anorexia and bulimia.

Back in 2018, she had spoken publicly about her struggles, explaining: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!'

She shared: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.

Mum isn't happy: The snap prompted a swift response from her mother, Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger. Fortunately, it turned out the small tattoo was only temporary

'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  

Ireland shared her journey in the hope of encouraging others not to suffer in silence and to seek help. 

'Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn’t worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn’t worth it!!' Ireland said. 

'Love yourself!! You are beautiful!! Enjoy your food. Eat ice cream with your friends! Workout and eat healthy to take care of your mind and body but find your healthy balance! Life is too short.' 

Big milestone: Last month, she had celebrated being free from eating disorders anorexia and bulimia for six years. She had first spoken about her struggles with food back in 2018
