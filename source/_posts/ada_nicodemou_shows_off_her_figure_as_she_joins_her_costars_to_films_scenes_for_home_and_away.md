She's played Leah Patterson-Baker on Channel Seven's Home and Away for the past 20 years.

And on Monday, Ada Nicodemou looked incredible as she showed off her figure in a tiny red skirt and white shirt while filming the show at Sydney's Palm Beach.

The actress, 43, completed her outfit with a pair of strappy heels as she held a paper in her hand and walked along the pier.
