Princess Sofia of Sweden has said she would never want a version of 'Megxit' from to happen within her royal family - stating she has 'found such a fantastic balance'. 

The 35-year-old royal, who is married to Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, 41, shared her thoughts in a documentary titled Princess Sofia: Project Playground which aired on Swedish channel TV4. 

According to Royal Central, when asked about whether she would ever consider following the lead of the Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 39, the former model said: 'No. Not really. I think I have found such a fantastic balance, and I really see it as a positive that I have made it through these stormy years. 

'It is such a huge advantage, in that we have the opportunity to stand a little in both worlds.'

At another stage in the documentary, which followed the former reality star in January visiting Cape Town, South Africa, where she worked as a volunteer and aid worker as a teenager, she discussed having an 'identity crisis' when she became a royal.

She said: 'Since I became a princess, I have been through many identity crises. Here in South Africa I have a type of identity, and when I come home, I have something else.

'Here I am allowed to be who I want to be.'    

Princess Sofia has much in common with Meghan with neither having any royal connections when they met their princes - Harry and Carl Philip - and leaving behind the showbiz world for a rather more sedate life. 

The royal, who worked in hospital's in Sweden during the pandemic, shared her thoughts on a documentary (Pictured: The princess at her first day at work at the Sophiahemmet hospital, Stockholm, in April)

Sofia dated her husband for five years before walking down the aisle in 2015.

They share two-year-old son Prince Alexander, Duke of Södermanland, and one-year-old Prince Gabriel, Duke of Dalarna who are fifth and sixth in line to the Swedish throne. 

Before marrying the prince, Sofia was a model and reality TV contestant. 

While Sofia never quite reached Meghan's level of celebrity, she had a taste of fame on a smaller level when she starred in the Swedish reality show Paradise Hotel. 

The mother-of-two said she had 'really seen it as a positive that she had made it through stormy years' in the documentary (pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Johannesburg, South Africa in October last year)

She made it through to the final of the Love Island meets Survivor type show, featuring a group of singles living at a luxury hotel, which featured a now infamous scene in which she was seen kissing 41-year-old American porn star Jenna Jameson.

Meanwhile Meghan caught the acting bug early, landing her first gig was a role in the daytime soap General Hospital and roles in the sci-fi drama Fringe, 90210 and CSI: NY followed. 

She also spent a year on the US version of Deal Or No Deal as one of its popular 'suitcase girls'. 

Sofia's comments come months after she started working in hospital to help Sweden's fight against coronavirus.

The royal took a three-day medical course at Sophiahemmet University College in Stockholm, where she is an honorary chair member, in April and has been helping with efforts ever since. 

Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess, who recently bought a $14 million mansion in Santa Barbara, have stepped into Hollywood after ditching royal duties in March.

Last week the couple revealed they had a new deal with Netflix to provide 'hope and inspiration' which is believed be worth as much as $150 million.
