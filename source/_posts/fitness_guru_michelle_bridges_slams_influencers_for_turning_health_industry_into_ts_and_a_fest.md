Former Biggest Loser trainer Michelle Bridges has criticised social media stars for turning the health industry into a 't**s and a*** fest'.

The concerned 49-year-old appeared to lash out at popular fitness influencers such as Tammy Hembrow and Natasha Oakley for setting unrealistic body expectations by sharing countless images of their six-pack abs and bountiful bottoms.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Michelle explained: 'I feel like I’m really old in saying that it concerns me and it worries me that my industry is turned into a T&A fest. But nonetheless, that’s where we’re at.'

Speaking on the new-age overemphasis on physicality, Michelle added: 'I feel like it's a place that we're going to be able to navigate, but we're going to have to start working on that.'

Michelle also explained that the health industry still has a long way to go to fairly promote sustainability and diversity.

'Back in the day, everybody used to throw their arms in the air about how everything was airbrushed, pulled in and tightened up. Magazines are almost dead and gone these days, but now it's just moved to Instagram. It's the same conversation.'

Michelle has built a hugely successful career as a personal trainer over three decades, which has seen her help plenty of people achieve their long-term health goals healthily and sustainably.

The TV star's fight for inclusivity prompted her to begin an activewear line with Big W a decade ago.

The line goes up to a size 26 and has been affordable for the masses, making it a runaway success for Michelle.

While Michelle has worked her way up in the fitness industry through conventional means, others have catapulted to success overnight by sharing their workouts and envy-inducing snaps of their toned physiques.

As one of Australia's most successful fitness influencers, Tammy Hembrow's 11.5 million followers are regularly treated to her scantily-clad snaps.

Bronte born influencer Natasha Oakley, who now lives in Los Angeles, is another success story, having racked up 2.2 million followers thanks to her impressive physique and sun-soaked workouts.

Despite the scrutiny faced by fitness influencers, many have capitalised extraordinarily on their digital success.

Australian fitness queen Kayla Itsines, 29, has built a global fitness empire worth $696million with her now ex-fiancé, Tobi Pearce.
