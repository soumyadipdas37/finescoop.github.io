Allyssa Gustafson, 24, pleaded guilty to a single count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse

A former teaching assistant in Illinois has pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student. 

Allyssa Gustafson, 24, had her guilty plea to a single count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse accepted by Judge Roger Webber on Monday.   

Gustafson will be sentenced on October 30, the News-Gazette reports.   

The mother-of-two, a former teacher assistant at Circle Academy in Urbana, was charged in November 2019 with engaging in multiple sex acts with the teen between August 1 and August 30. 

The school serves children who have behavioral and emotional challenges. 

Champaign police allegedly found photos that Gustafson sent to the student that consisted of her in a bathing suit and in lingerie.   

Gustafson and the teen had an alleged sexual encounter at the teen's home in Champaign, according to prosecutors. Assistant State's Attorney Kristin Alferink said that police had evidence that showed that the woman and the teen met as many as five times before the end of the previous school year, WAND reports. 

The former teacher assistant at Circle Academy in Urbana was charged in Nov 2019 with engaging in multiple sex acts with the teen between Aug 1 and Aug 30 

The mother-of-two got a reduced bail after her lawyer argued that she was cooperating with the Department of Children and Family Services

The two are also said to have talked through Facebook Messenger and Snapchat. She would eventually tell the teen that he needed to delete their conversations and told him that she had to block him, according to Alferink.     

Because of the plea deal, a harsher count of criminal sexual assault was dismissed by Alferink. 

Gustafson's bail was originally set for $250,000 but was dropped to $100,000 after her lawyer, Mark Lipton, argued that his client had been aware of the investigation and had been following instructions regarding her child and the Department of Children and Family Services.
