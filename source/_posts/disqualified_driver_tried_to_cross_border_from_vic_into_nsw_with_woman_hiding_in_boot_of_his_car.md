A disqualified driver has been charged after allegedly trying to travel across the border from Victoria into NSW with a woman hiding in the boot of his car.

The 34-year-old was stopped by police at a checkpoint on the Hume Highway in Albury on Saturday morning. 

He produced a valid permit but did not have identification, NSW Police said in a statement on Sunday.

Police discovered the man was disqualified from driving and during a search of his car, allegedly found a 41-year-old woman hiding in the boot.

The woman did not have a permit and was directed to return to Victoria.

She allegedly drove through a red light while doing so and was issued with two traffic infringement notices and was fined $1000 for failing to comply with a COVID-19 public health order.

The 34-year-old man from West Wodonga was charged with not complying with a COVID-19 direction, driving a motor vehicle during a disqualified period and driving with a passenger who was not wearing a seatbelt.

He was refused bail to appear at Albury Local Court on Monday.
