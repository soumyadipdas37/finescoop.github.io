This Morning's Dr Zoe Williams shocked viewers today by revealing the Singapore Grip is a technique used by women to tighten their vagina during sex. 

Actor David Morrissey, 56, joined Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby to discuss his period drama of the same name, which has been adapted from the J.G. Farrell novel and follows a British family living in Singapore in the 1940s as their son gets caught in a love triangle. 

However, Phil and Holly couldn't help but mention another meaning of 'Singapore Grip,' eventually showing a clip from Dr Zoe Williams where she explained that the term 'Singapore Grip' referred to a sexual act. 

Many of those watching were surprised the show mentioned the cheeky definition, with some complaining it was too early for the X-rated chat.

Dr Zoe Williams left viewers shocked on This Morning when she gave an X-rated definition of the term 'Singapore Grip'

After the two hosts tried to egg David on to give the explanation himself, the actor deflated, saying he thought it related to an economic term. 

However a stone-faced Dr Zoe told viewers: 'The Singapore grip is a sexual technique which involves the woman using her vaginal muscles to stimulate a man's penis during intercourse while they remain stationary.'

Her intervention left Phil and Holly, who had said explaining the term was 'their duty' in stitches. 

Meanwhile David, who plays the central character in the ITV drama, joked: 'Is that in episode three?' 

Presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were left in stitches during their interview with actor David Morrissey, who plays Walter Blackett in the ITV adaptation of the J.G. Farrell novel 

'It is perfect Sunday night viewing,' Holly offered cheekily. 

'Well that should get our viewers numbers up nothing will,' David added with a laugh.  

And the actor was not the only one who didn't know about the term, with many viewers revealing their shock on Twitter, with one saying: 'The Singapore Grip' was named after a sexual technique?!' 

'Oh my god! Did they just do that?' added another. 

'Well you learn something new everyday,' a third said.  



 









Many of those watching at home were left shocked after the definition was shared live on the morning talk show 

However, some thought Dr Zoe's interview was perhaps a bit too raunchy for a morning show, with one writing: 'That went a bit x-rated.' 

'Call me a prude but discussing sexual matters at 10.45am on #thismorning is inappropriate,' another said.

The Singapore Grip series, which is currently airing on ITV on Sunday nights, is adapted from the novel by J.G. Farrell, published in 1978.

It is a satirical work on the start of World War II and Japans's entry into the conflict by invading South East Asia occupying Singapore. 

It follows in the footsteps of Downton Abbey and The Durrells as ITV's new six-part period drama - but The Singapore Grip  has so far failed to win over viewers. Pictured, the Blackett family and guests appearing shocked by their evening entertainment

However, the story focuses on a wealthy British family living in the area and their son, who gets caught into a love triangle. 

In the novel, the term 'Singapore grip' is a running joke, as naive Matthew Webb doesn't know it describes a sexual act and uses in a variety of other ways, to describe a type of greeting or a bag. 

The series has been widely panned by viewers, with audiences at home 'switching off' and complaining about the 'bizarre' storyline - after the first episode shifted timelines from before and during the Second World War's Battle of Singapore.
