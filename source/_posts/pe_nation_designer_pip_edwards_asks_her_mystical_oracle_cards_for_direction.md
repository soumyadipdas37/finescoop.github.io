She's Sydney's streetwear queen who is known as the city's ultimate cool girl. 

And on Monday, Pip Edwards didn't disappoint as she showed off her new age 'evening ritual' on Instagram. 

The 40-year-old proved she's open minded as she showcased what appeared to be burnt sage, scented candles and a deck of Animal Dreaming Oracle Cards.

New age queen: Burning sage, candles and oracle cards: P.E Nation's Pip Edwards, 40, (pictured) showed off her bizarre new age 'evening ritual' to Instagram on Monday

Oracle cards are similar to Tarot cards, but focus on 'the big picture' rather than the 'ingredients', according to website Biddy Taro.

The Oracle cards focus on animal energies, allowing the user to commune with the energies of nature. 

Lighting the herb sage cleans the card deck and is also known to clean air. 

A number of candles were also sitting on the table.

There it is: Pip showed off sage, oracle cards and a sign which read: 'She is strong but she is tired' along with an assortment of candles 

Also seen on the table was a book which read: 'She is strong, but she is tired.' 

Pip didn't offer an explanation of the items, but seemed enthusiastic with the new age elements of her evening ritual. 

One part of Pip's life which certainly doesn't need any help is her relationship with former cricketer, Michael Clarke.  

They're smitten! Pip Edwards snuggled up to Michael in his designer closet last week as she continues to spend more time at his mansion

On Thursday evening, Pip posted a picture of the pair snuggling up in his designer closet at his Bondi Beach pad.   

In the picture, former Australian cricket captain Michael, 39, was seen wrapping his arm around the business mogul's neck and tenderly caressing her arm. 

Pip was barefoot in the impressive closet, wearing a pair of baggy casual black trousers and a white tank top.    

Going strong: Pip and Michael have been dating for months after meeting and falling for each other following his split from ex-wife, Kyly Clarke

In a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, Michael reflected on his life, a year after separating from wife of seven years, Kyly Clarke.

While he preferred to keep coy about his new romance with Pip, the retired Australian cricketer did reveal that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.

Change of scene: Pip appears to be spending more and more time at Michael's home, as evidenced from her Instagram selfies

Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.

The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12. 

Happy: Reports surfaced Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge. Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month. Pictured here with friends
