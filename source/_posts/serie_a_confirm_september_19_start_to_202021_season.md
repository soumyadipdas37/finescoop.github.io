The 2020-21 Serie A season will get underway on September 19, the Italian FA confirmed on Monday. 

With both England and Spain starting up their forthcoming domestic campaigns on September 12, Italy have clarified their position to fall in line with the start of the German Bundesliga. 

Fixtures are to be released on September 2 when Juventus' new boss Andrea Pirlo will see the path ahead as he looks to make it 10 straight league titles for the club.  

The 2020-21 start to the Serie A season has been confirmed as September 19 by the Italian FA

Former Juventus boss Antonio Conte is tasked with stopping them with his Inter Milan side

The 2019-20 Serie A season officially wrapped up on August 1 before Atalanta, Juventus, Inter and Napoli continued with Champions League and Europa League participation. 

Only Inter Milan progressed, reaching the Europa League final where they were beaten by Sevilla in Germany on August 21. 

In a report carried in a recent edition of Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are keen to see their opening match of the new league postponed so as to give them more recovery time following their late finish in comparison to rivals.

Despite Juventus' unrelenting dominance in Serie A over the last nine seasons, there will be plenty of interest in intrigue in the new campaign as Andrea Pirlo prepares for his first managerial role. 

He had been expected to gain experience with the youth team but nine days after being unveiled in that position he was promoted to the first team following the sacking of Maurizio Sarri. 

Pirlo has managed to get down to work on the training field with his players and there will be plenty of Juventus fans counting down the days until he takes charge of his first official league match.
