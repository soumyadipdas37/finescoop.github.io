Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched Uzor, 23, during the pandemic. 

It's been reported that lockdown made it impossible for the couple to 'build a relationship' as they were unable to meet up with one another. 

In a statement shared with MailOnline, the blonde beauty confirmed the COVID-19 lockdown played a role in the demise of their romance, but insisted they continue to be friends. 

The statement read: 'After a whirlwind romance in the Love Island villa, unfortunately Jessica Gale and Ched Uzor have made the mutual decision to split.

'They have unfortunately felt the effects of lockdown separation but will continue as friends. 

'They wish nothing but the best for each other and full success in each others careers.'
