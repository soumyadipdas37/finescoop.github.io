Five-time Grammy winner Mariah Carey announced she was 'so excited' to executive produce and star in Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special, which will air this holiday season on Apple TV+.

'If you know me, you know I refuse to talk about Christmas before it's even fall,' the 50-year-old R&B diva - who boasts 60.8M social media followers - tweeted.

'But I am so excited for this @AppleTV special that I'll make an exception today only!'

Roman Coppola and Hamish Hamilton will co-direct the innovative special featuring surprise guests, music, dancing, and animation 'driven by a universally heartwarming story that brings the world together.'

2020 marks the 26th anniversary of Mariah's 1994 classic carol, All I Want for Christmas Is You, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 2019 and has amassed over $60M in royalties.

Last December, Carey enlisted her nine-year-old fraternal twins Monroe and Moroccan (with ex-husband #2 Nick Cannon) to make merry cameos in the Make My Wish Come True Edition music video.

The native New Yorker also embarked on a 55-date All I Want for Christmas Is You: A Night of Joy and Festivity tour last year.

Last Wednesday, Mariah recorded the audio version of her 368-page memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey, which hits shelves on September 29.

'If somebody or something didn't pertain to the actual meaning of Mariah Carey, as is the title, then they aren't in the book' Carey told Vulture on Monday.

'I cried writing a lot of parts of this book. Maybe it's because I have such vivid recollections. You know what? I'm sure I'm going to have to deal with a lot of people being upset with me. I hope not...There's so much more dragging that could have been done. I really didn't say everything.'
