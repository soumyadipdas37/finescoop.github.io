'And he was teetering, balancing back and forth trying to negotiate which way to fall. I watched him do that for about 15 minutes. 

'Then I was introduced to him, before he fell, and from that moment on you just knew... there are moments in life when you know this will happen one time and one time only, when you get the opportunity to spend time with greatness.'
