An amateur pole dancer has pleaded guilty to common assault charges after she spat on a commuter while they boarded a train.

Laura Zammit, from western Sydney, told a court her victim was pushing on her back when they queued to get on a train headed to the Blue Mountains from Parramatta Station on June 19.

The 26-year-old threatened her victim by raising her right fist as they entered the carriage.

Police facts state the victim said 'whatever, keep on going' before the Penrith woman turned around and spat on his face at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic.

The victim sat with a witness in the same and notified Blacktown train station staff after exiting the train, who contacted police.

Zammit faced Parramatta Local Court on Tuesday where her lawyer Andrew Sant said she spat on the victim because she thought he touched her backside.

Magistrate Tim Keady rubbished claims the victim had touched her inappropriately.

He believed the victim was simply boarding from a crowded train platform.

'If this man punched you in the face, what would your reaction be?' Magistrate Keady said, as reported by Parramatta Advertiser.

'Spitting at someone — that is the most extreme form of disgusting.'

Zammit was given a two-year conditional release order and no conviction.
