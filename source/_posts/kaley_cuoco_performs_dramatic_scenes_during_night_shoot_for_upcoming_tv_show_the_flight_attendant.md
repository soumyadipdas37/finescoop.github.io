She recently returned to shoot her upcoming TV show The Flight Attendant, following a prolonged break from production amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

And Kaley Cuoco was seen getting into character as she performed dramatic scenes during a night shoot at New York City's Hudson River Park on Monday.

Braving the windy chill enveloping the bustling metropolis, the 34-year-old actress wrapped up in a smart grey coat, which she teamed with faded cropped jeans.

Adding height to her frame with a pair of platform boots, the blonde beauty was seen looking alarmed as she chatted on her phone before rolling cameras.

Standing on a bridge before sitting on a bench, the actress carried a large handbag as she got into character during the shoot, which ran from dusk into the night.

She only recently recently returned to work on her HBO Max series, sharing some behind-the-scenes masked selfies earlier this month with co-star Michiel Huisman.

She captioned the photos: 'We’re back!! Keeping our distance of course! ...Time to land this [airplane emoji]!'

The suspenseful drama series went on hiatus back in March, as the COVID-19 lockdown forced Hollywood to temporarily shut down.

Production previously wrapped on all international locations, with about three episodes left to shoot, which will all film in New York City.

Kaley executive produces and stars as Cassie, a flight attendant who wakes up in a strange place with a dead man in her bed and no recollection of what happened.

She also shared a masked-up selfie over the weekend with co-star Zosia Mamet, writing: 'Friends that get covid tested every few days , wear masks, take necessary pre-cautions, listen to production rule, wash hands all day long and respect the process together, get to act together @zosiamamet 

'This picture was taken right before we shot today’s scene in a very structured quarantined environment. Very proud of our cast and crew at #theflightattendant and everyone @warnerbrostv & @hbomax for making this possible for us!'

The 8 Simple Rules actress revealed in a video post last month on Instagram that she was returning to work on her new show.

She said: 'The first update would be that I am going back to work! So my sister, me and my trusty assistant Emma go back to New York on Monday. And we have to quarantine – I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff on social media about our quarantine.

'We'll be quarantined for two weeks and you'll get a look at our shenanigans, I'm sure. And then back to work. We only have like two and a half episodes left, so I'm going to wrap up by the beginning of October.'

The show, which is expected to premiere in November, is based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian.

Kaley continued: 'I don't have an exact date but that is exciting at all in itself. I don't know if you guys know this but I have been working on this project for three years. 

'It goes back to three years from when I actually found the original book, so it's very exciting for me, and then obviously developing it for over two years.'
