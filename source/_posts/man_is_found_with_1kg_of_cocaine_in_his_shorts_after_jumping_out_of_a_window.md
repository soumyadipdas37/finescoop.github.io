A man accused of jumping out the window of an industrial shed to escape police has been arrested after police allegedly found 1kg of cocaine hidden in his shorts.

The 31-year-old accused drug dealer was charged with a string of offences after officers swarmed a property on Giggins Road in Heatherbrae, in the NSW Hunter Region. 

Investigators arrived at the scene on Wednesday as part of an inquiry into domestic violence and drug trafficking.

A 31-year-old man in the Hunter Valley was charged with a string of offences related to drug supply and domestic violence 

Police were first called to a home in East Maitland on September 5 where they spoke to a 30-year-old woman.

During a subsequent search of the home an array of drugs and cash were allegedly uncovered.

The haul allegedly included cannabis, methylamphetamine, steroids, cocaine, and over $20,000 cash. 

In the days that followed, officers from the Northern Region Domestic Violence High-Risk Offender team and the Port Stephens-Hunter Proactive Crime Team turned their attention to an industrial property.

When officers arrived 'a man jumped out a side window and attempted to evade police', NSW Police said.

'The 31-year-old man was arrested a short time later when police noticed a large package hidden inside the man's shorts.'

Police noticed a large package hidden inside the man's shorts which is believed to be cocaine

'The package was removed and found to contain 1kg of cocaine. It was seized for forensic examination.'

Police then established a crime scene at the industrial property and executed a search warrant.

'Police located and seized motorcycles, a car, methylamphetamine, cash, mobile phones and knuckle dusters,' NSW Police said.

The man was taken to Raymond Terrace Police Station and charged with five offences relating to drug supply, stalking and intimidation and dealing with proceeds of crime.

He was refused bail to will appear at Maitland Local Court on Thursday.
