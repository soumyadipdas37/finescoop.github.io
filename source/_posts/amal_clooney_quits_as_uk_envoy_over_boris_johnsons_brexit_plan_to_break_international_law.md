Top international lawyer Amal Clooney blasted Boris Johnson's 'lamentable' Brexit plans today as she quit as a UK Government envoy on media freedom.

The top human rights expert and wife of actor George Clooney announced she was quitting the high profile post over Mr Johnson's intention to bring in new legislation  that would over-ride part of the Withdrawal Agreement he signed last year.

She is the latest lawyer to distance themselves from the Government over the Internal Market Bill, which is passed would break international law.

In a letter to Foreign Secretary this afternoon she said: 'It is lamentable for the UK to be speaking of its intention to violate an international treaty signed by the Prime Minister less than a year ago.'
