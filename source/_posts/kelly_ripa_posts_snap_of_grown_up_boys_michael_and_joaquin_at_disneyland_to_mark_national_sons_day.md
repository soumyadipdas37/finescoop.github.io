Her 19-year-old daughter warned her this week not to even think about doing anything embarrassing on her upcoming 50th birthday on Friday.

But on Monday, Kelly Ripa focused on her sons Joaquin and Michael.

She marked National Sons Day by posting a photo to Instagram of her two boys posing at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland.

Ripa and Consuelos recently provided scholarships to 20 homeless students in New York City.

The pair have paid for laptops and scholarships worth $2,000 each for a total of 20 of the most vulnerable students who are headed to college in New York, according to People magazine.

Their donation is being done in partnership with the Win foundation in New York, which 'provides safe housing and critical services to help homeless women and their children rebuild their lives and break the cycle of homelessness'.
