She has made a living posing in swimsuits during her 24-year modelling career. 

And Alessandra Ambrosio was sure to set pulses racing with her latest Instagram snaps as she relaxed at the Waldorf Astoria in the Maldives on Monday.

The Victoria's Secret model, 39, showed off her sensational figure in a gold bikini from her swimsuit brand GAL Floripa as she enjoyed a sun-soaked outing in the sea.

Alessandra's ensemble fit snugly on her slender frame and showed off her toned abs as well a glimpse of her cleavage, while it had chic tie-detailing.  

She added a glittering touch to her look with a gold chain necklace and pearl earrings, while she shielded her eyes with aviator shades.

The model slicked her hair back over her head after enjoying a dip in the crystal-blue ocean, and she wore a light palette of make-up for the snaps.

The model flew to the Maldives earlier this week with her two children and boyfriend of two years, Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi. 

Alessandra shares her kids, Anja, 12 and Noah, 8 with her ex-fiance Jamie Mazur whom she split from after 10 years though he was not present on the dream trip.

In addition to having a luxurious family vacation, Alessandra and her family were there to celebrate her daughter Anja who turned 12 on Monday.

The whole extended Ambrosio family was invited to relax and celebrate, as her parents Lucilda and Luiz were in attendance as well as her cousins.  

The veteran model paid tribute to her 'ray of sunshine' with a series of posts and documented the celebratory family outing on her social media.  

Before jetting to the Maldives, Alessandra and her family had been locked down in their Santa Monica, California home.

Last week the swimsuit designer was seen getting a COVID test with her daughter ahead of their international travels to make sure everything was copacetic before departing. 

With the modeling industry slowly starting to ramp up again Alesandra will no doubt be back to work soon though she has been loving being at home with her family.

In the meantime she has found ways to get creative with her career and swimsuit line, as she has been modeling her latest designs from the comfort of her own home.
