Frank Lampard believes the club's £22million move for Rennes' goalkeeper Edouard Mendy is on the verge of completion.

The Chelsea boss has been trying to bring in a new shot-stopper all summer and looks to finally have his man. 

If Mendy arrives in time he could be set to make his debut in this weekend's trip to West Brom, with Kepa Arrizabalaga facing the drop after a difficult start to the season.

Frank Lampard believes the shot-stopper's medical is done ahead of a £22million transfer

'With Mendy, the medical, I think it's done, but I want to be a bit careful and don't want to give absolute confirmation until I see him, possibly over the next 24 hours,' said Lampard. 

'But it seems like it's on the verge of being done.'

Current No1 Arrizabalaga has struggled in the opening games of the season. The 'keeper let a weak shot squeeze past him in the first match against Brighton and was under-fire against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.

The Spaniard was at fault for the Reds' second goal after his uncertainty on the ball allowed Sadio Mane to intercept his clearance before finishing into the net.

Chelsea beat Championships side Barnsley 6-0 to progress to the fourth-round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night, with new signing Kai Havertz scoring a hat-trick.

Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud also got on the scoresheet while Willy Caballero kept a clean sheet in his first start of the season.

New signings Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell made their debuts at Stamford Bridge. 

Silva played 61 minutes before he was substituted for Kurt Zouma while Chilwell replaced Havertz for the final 25 minutes and grabbed an assist by setting up Giroud.
