A manhunt is underway for a thug who hurled a metal tool through a woman's car window and into her head, leaving her soaked in blood.

Tammy Andrews, 45, was driving to the chemist in her white Ford Falcon in Greenfields, south of Perth, at 7pm on Tuesday when a man ran up to her car.

The stranger, who police believe is in his 20s, launched the socket extender through the car window, slicing the right side of her head.

'Someone ran from the park and threw the tool through my window and hit me in the side of the head,' she told The West Australian. 

Ms Andrews said her head went numb before she saw the blood.  

She was able to drive a short distance to a friend's place before she was taken to Peel Health Campus. 

'I had 18 staples in my head and today all the bruising in coming out so it is very sore and very traumatic.'
