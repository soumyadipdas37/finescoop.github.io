Kamala Harris turned heads when she wore Timberland boots to visit the devastation of the California wildfires this week, but Twitter users slammed the Democratic Vice President candidate for copying Melania Trump's style. 

The California senator and Governor Gavin Newsom walked through the wreckage of the Creek Fire and toured a Red Cross evacuation center on Tuesday.

As Harris talked about the impact of climate change on the wildfires, she caught the attention of social media users for her outfit.

She sported camel colored Timberland boots with a white shirt, green jacket and jean as her power outfit, but some angry social media users accused her of wearing the same shoes and a similar outfit Melania has worn before. 

The First Lady wore similar wheat-colored Timberland boots in 2018 during a trip to the Al Asad Air Base to visit American troops in Iraq.

In one of her outfits from the trip Melania wore a green jacket, white top and white jeans with the iconic camel boots.

'Melania wore them first,' one Twitter user said.

'I still remember the press blasting Melania for wearing Timberlands ,weird how they quickly change their minds!' another added.

One tweet said: 'The media when FLOTUS wears Timberlands: THIS IS NOT A FASHION SHOW. The media when Kamala wears Timberlands: SHE‘S BRINGING TIMES BACK.'

Melania has been heavily criticized for some of her fashion choices. In June 2018 she sparked outrage for wearing a Zara jacket with the phrase, 'I really don’t care, do u?' while visiting detention centers holding migrant children at the border in Texas.

One Twitter user blasted how the media praised Harris for her 'cool' look with the shoes, but reminded the public how social media blasted Melania for her choice of the same shoes in 2018. 

'Melania Trump gets mocked for wearing Timberland boots while visiting troops,' one article from 2018 said. While one from this week said, 'Kamala Harris may have made Timberland boots cool again'.

Melania Trump has faced intense scrutiny for her fashion choices.

She was eviscerated for wearing 'storm stiletto' high heels during a visit to tour the damage in Houston, Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.

She also sparked outrage in June 2018 for wearing a Zara jacket with the phrase, 'I really don’t care, do u?' while visiting detention centers holding migrant children at the border in Texas.

She wore that after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to separate migrant children from their families at the border.

However, some noted that Harris has worn these shoes before. She was spotted wearing the same boots in August last year and during the primary this year.

Many praised Harris for her cool look and for sporting the workwear Timberland boots, which gained popularity in the 90s with the New York rap scene worn by the likes of Tupac, Aaliyah, Wu-Tang Clan and rapped about by the Notorious B.I.G.

Meena Harris, Kamaka’s niece shared a video of Harris dismounting the plane Tuesday in California with the caption: 'THE TIMBS THO'.

'The @KamalaHarris de-planing videos & her completely appropriate self-confidence every time are quickly becoming one of my favorite things about this campaign,' one Twitter user added.

'Kamala Harris in California being Vice Presidential with her Timberlands,' another added.

Social media users speculated that Harris brought out the Timberlands in an satorial campaign to appear more casual and approachable with voters.
