The condoms were confiscated as evidence but will be disposed of immediately because they are considered dangerous medical waste.

A government official said: 'Condoms are classified as medical items, so we will take a look at the several laws that the owner has broken.'  

It is not known how many condoms had already been sold but the load found by police weighed 360kg.

Local reports said they were being supplied to hotels and market stalls near the warehouse.
