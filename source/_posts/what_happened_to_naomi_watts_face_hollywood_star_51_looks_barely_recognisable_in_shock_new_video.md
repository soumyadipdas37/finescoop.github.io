In recent weeks, Naomi has been living at her home in the Hamptons while waiting out the coronavirus pandemic.

She has also been spotted with her boyfriend, actor Billy Crudup, in the area.

In July, Naomi revealed how she's been keeping 'sane' while in lockdown and tackling her 'anxiety' while at home. 

Speaking to Vogue, the blonde said that she's been cooking, reading, taking care of herself and 'taking it day by day.' 

'I'm a planner and not being able to think too far forward gives me anxiety,' Naomi told the publication.

'With all the uncertainty it's best to just think small… ''how do I get through this day?''

Naomi said that talking to friends regularly helps.

'We are collectively sharing this experience and mostly everyone is having to deal with some level of frustration, sadness, or loneliness, and therefore we all need to find ways to connect.'

She said she's also been making sure to prioritise self-care, and has been using an oil before bed to help her get to sleep - $76 De Mamiel Sleep Series Settle oil. 

The age-defying blonde said she's also been using the $99 Jao Goe body oil on her skin.
