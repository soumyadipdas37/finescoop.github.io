Former Married At First Sight stars Jules Robinson and Cam Merchant are set to welcome their first child in the coming weeks.

And Cam gave fans an update about who will be in the delivery room with them when Jules goes into labour - and it's not who you would expect. 

Appearing on the podcast The Babble on Monday, the reality star joked that A Current Affair host Tracy Grimshaw could be the one deliver their baby.

'Tracy Grimshaw potentially could deliver our baby,' Cam joked. 

'We got married on A Current Affair, so why not. And, Tracy, she's a good friend.'

But all jokes aside, Cam revealed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic at one stage they were concerned that Cam wouldn't even be allowed in the room.

'There was one stage where we thought I might not even be able to get into the hospital room to deliver the baby and how shattering would that be. 

However, restrictions have begun to ease since then, and Cam will be holding Jules hand throughout the whole experience. 

Meanwhile the couple are racing against the clock to renovate their new $1.8million home ahead of the birth of their first child.

But it seems that things are really coming together for the couple.

Jules, 36, shared a series of posts to Instagram on Monday, giving fans an update on their renovations.

In one video, a tradesman can be seen laying down flooring in the hallway, after having painted the walls, and Jules also revealed that she had chosen a bright red colour for their front door.

It was reported earlier this month that Jules and Cam had bought a $1.8million property in Sydney's Northern Beaches.

The purchase came after Cam sold his apartment in Kirribilli for $900,000.

Their contemporary family home features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a large outdoor entertaining area.
