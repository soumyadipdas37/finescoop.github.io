Amber, who is the daughter of hitmaker Simon Le Bon and model Yasmin Le Bon, was putting on an elegant display in the chic chiffon number. 

She wore her hair in loose lengths and went for natural make-up to best showcase her pretty good looks while also oozing glamour in the gown. 

Lady Sabrina meanwhile let her dress do the talking as she wore her hair scraped back while opting for a wholly fresh-faced look. 

She wore a colourful dress with a pussybow neckline and all the classic trimmings of a gown from the iconic designer.

Amber and Lady Sabrina are known to mingle together, with the former attending the latter's engagement party at Chelsea's No. Fifty Cheyne in March.  

Sabrina, who is a distant relation of the Duke of Northumberland and his daughter, Hogwarts heiress Lady Melissa Percy, celebrated her engagement to beau Phineas Page with a swanky bash prior to COVID lockdown.

A vision: Jemima Cadbury was joining in the festivities 

The brunette beauty, who has modelled for the Italian fashion label on a number of occasions, took to Instagram to thank the designers for the 'incredible piece', calling it the 'dress of her dreams'. 

It appears the label was also behind the dazzling necklace and chandelier earrings worn by the bride-to-be, who added a thanks for the 'jaw-dropping jewellery set that came with it [the dress]'. 

Despite being blue-blooded - the Percys' ancestral seat is Northumberland Castle, where Harry Potter was filmed - Sabrina is known for being down-to-earth and used to pull pints in a Chelsea pub in order to pay her way through college.
