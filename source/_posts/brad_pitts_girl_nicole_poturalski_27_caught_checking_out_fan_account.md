Brad Pitt's girlfriend has been caught checking out a fan account dedicated to her new romance.

Nicole Poturalski, 27, was spotted lurking on the Instagram stories to the fan account nicobrad2020, which is all about supporting 'Hollywood's next super couple.'

'Jennifer and Angelina dead. It's Nicole's time?' the bio reads.

The account was elated to see Nicole had been checking out their stories, and took a screenshot of their viewers as evidence.

Indeed, Nico.Potur was one of the story watchers.

'Queen watched my story, love you Nicole,' the elated account wrote in the screenshot.

Nicole seemed to have even followed the account at one point, but it appears she no longer does so.

New love: Her snap comes after it was revealed by MailOnline that Nicole met Hollywood superstar Pitt, 56, at her husband's high-class Berlin restaurant (pictured January 2020)

Her snap comes after it was revealed by MailOnline that Nicole met Hollywood superstar Pitt, 56, at her husband's high-class Berlin restaurant.

Pitt is said to have been mesmerised by the striking brunette with the seductive pout when he locked eyes on her for the first time in August 2019.

Double Oscar winner Pitt became acquainted with Borchardt and its flamboyant owner Roland Mary, 68, in 2009 when he was filming on location in Germany for the Quentin Tarantino movie, Inglorious Basterds.

He returned to the €150-a-head city centre restaurant in August last year while promoting his latest Tarantino movie, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, with the legendary director and co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie.

And it was in that night in August last year that he met Nicole - who bears a startling resemblance to his ex-wife Angelina Jolie - for the first time and fell in love.

The model was in Los Angeles a few weeks later for a photo shoot and met up with Brad. They were later pictured together at a Kanye West concert in November 2009.

A year on, Brad Pitt and Nicole Poturalski are a couple in love and recently spent time at his luxury £50 million Chateau Miraval in the south of France.

Hilarious: A Twitter user pointed out the new follower online 

'Brad Pitt first met Nicole [Poturalski] in August last year at Borchardt which is her husband Roland's restaurant,' a friend of Nicole told MailOnline.

'Brad Pitt has been coming to Borchardt for years. He knows Roland [Mary] and Nicole was at the restaurant when he came to celebrate his new film.

'Brad was introduced to Roland's wife Nicole [Poturalski] and she passed him her number.

'Nicole travels a lot for her work as a fashion model and he connected with Brad Pitt while she was in LA for work.'

Nicole remains married and has a seven-year-old son called Emil with Roland.

The youngster recently started school in Berlin but was pictured earlier this month in Beverley Hills with mum Nicole.

Roland Mary declined to discuss his wife's love affair with Brad when contacted by MailOnline. He said simply: 'No comment.'

However Roland is said to be 'philosophical' about his wife's 'close friendship' with the Hollywood heart-throb Pitt.

The friend told MailOnline: 'Roland is a very philosophical guy. He has been married several times and has five children. He is not interested in negativity or jealousy.

'They are still married but you could describe their relationship as an "open marriage".'

A spokesman for Brad Pitt declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.
