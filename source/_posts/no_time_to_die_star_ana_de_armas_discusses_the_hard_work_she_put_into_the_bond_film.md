Ana is still adjusting to life in the spotlight.

Being away from her family while on lockdown in Los Angeles has been hard on her. 'I miss my family so much,' said the star whose relatives are in Cuba.

'It's a different experience for me to be in LA,' she said. The actress is often photographed walking her dog or being next to her Dark Water costar Affleck whom she has been dating this year. 

The two have not been photographed together in months as he has been in Ireland making The Last Duel with Matt Damon. 

Then Ana said she did not think of fame before she started acting.

'It is just a consequence of my job,' said the star matter of factly.

The fame she has experienced so far has helped her relate to Marilyn Monroe. 'It was her worst nightmare,' said de Armas.

Ana also shared that her Knives Out co-star Jamie Lee Curtis helped her land the role of Marilyn Monroe in the upcoming film Blonde.

The fame game: With her beau Ben in July in LA. Ana said she did not think of fame before she started acting

'She is my biggest cheerleader,' said Ana. 

'I showed her my screen test for Marilyn and of course I had on like a random wig they found which didn't fit me, so-so makeup and so-so wardrobe but even then, seeing me in the part like that, she got very excited.'

Playing Monroe was 'very intense,' added the beauty.

Rational: 'It is just a consequence of my job,' said the star matter of factly

She also talked her breakout role in Knives Out, an ensemble murder mystery with Don Johnson.

When she got the offer all it said was she was going to play a 'Latina, caretaker, pretty.'

'I really pay attention to what that little description is,' she said. 'I'm sure whoever did it wasn't thinking about what that mean but for me, I was just like, "Oh no, I'm not doing this!" What do you mean, "Latina, caretaker, pretty?"'

And she added she is very proud of being Latina.

'Even if you are playing a Latina, not all Latinas are the same... I want to think and believe that I can play anybody, anywhere in the world because the stories I want to tell are universal.'

When she read the script she was thrilled and felt comfortable with her character that she describes as a 'diamond' but she was 'terrified' as her insecurities about her talent and her ability to speak English well crept in.

De Armas also said, 'I think there needs to be a push for better roles for Latinas overall.'  

As far as her next project, there is nothing due to COVID and she hopes 2021 will be better. The star also mentioned a Knives Out sequel which she hopes will happen.
