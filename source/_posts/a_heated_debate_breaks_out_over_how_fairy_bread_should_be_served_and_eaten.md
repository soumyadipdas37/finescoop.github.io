A heated debate has erupted over the correct way to serve and eat fairy bread, a traditional Australian party food.

The earliest recordings of fairy bread come from 1929 when The Hobart Mercury described children eating the iconic snack at a birthday party.

It's typically made using slices of white bread cut into triangles coated in butter and hundreds and thousands sprinkles on top. 

But Reddit user Pokemaniacgaming unknowingly caused a stir online three days ago after posting his version of the childhood classic, except he chose to keep his bread whole, rather than cutting it into triangles.

He also dotted the sprinkles in the centre of the bread, rather than coating the entire slice.

'Triangles! This needs to be triangles. I was trying to figure out why this looked so wrong to me. I just weirdly can't imagine it tasting right if it's not in triangle form,' one person responded.

'Not cut into triangles. Traitor,' said another.

A third added: 'What kind of animal doesn't have sprinkles to the edge and cut it into triangles? I guess it's still 2020'.

Others were mostly appalled by the lack of ingredients sitting on top of the bread, and said it was a 'p**s poor effort'.

'Did you run low on 100s and 1000s? They need to go right to the edges!!!' One woman said.

One person suggested filling a bowl with the rainbow sprinkles and pushing the slice face down into it to get a proper coating

'The 100s and 1000s density in the centre is also a little too high, hold the shaker at a higher altitude for more even coverage,' said another.

One person suggested filling a bowl with the rainbow sprinkles and pushing the slice face down into it to get a proper coating.

There was some backlash about the inclusion of crusts, which are often cut off in the original recipe - although this can be deemed wasteful.

While there is no exact science to how to eat your fairy bread, there should only ever be three ingredients included: bread, hundreds and thousands and butter.
