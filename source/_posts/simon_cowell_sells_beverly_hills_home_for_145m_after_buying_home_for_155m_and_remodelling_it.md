Simon Cowell has reportedly parted with a a luxurious property in one of Beverly Hills' most sought after neighbourhoods, after selling it for $14.5million.

However, the princely sum still amounts to a loss for the mogul, as he purchased the four-bedroom, six-bathroom Trousdale Estates home back in 2011 for $15.5million.

Hot property: Simon Cowell has reportedly parted with a a luxurious property in one of Beverly Hills' most sought after neighbourhoods, after selling it for $14.5million

Sitting on 0.65 acres, the 7,300 square foot mansion was built in 1966 and designed by architect Hal Levitt, who has designed houses owned by such stars as Ellen DeGeneres and Jennifer Aniston.

He is believed to have purchased the home from prolific music executive LA Reid, and it was featured on the American version of the X Factor in 2012.

Simon, who splits his time between his homes in Malibu and London, recently sold his main Beverly Hills residence for $25million.

News of the sale comes after Simon was reported to have bought and then quickly flipped a $3.9million home in Los Angeles' Hidden Hills area, which previously belonged to his former 2006 X Factor mentee Leona Lewis. 

It is understood that a corporate entity linked to the music mogul agreed to an off-market deal to purchase the singer's abode but ended up quickly selling it on at a loss for $3.7million, reports Variety. 

According to property records, the Bleeding Love singer sold the 5,900 square foot estate not even a year after she first purchased it for $3.6million. 

MailOnline contacted representatives for Simon Cowell and Leona Lewis' for comment at the time.

Remodelled: According to Variety, not only did Simon sell the home for $1million less than his purchasing price, he also remodelled the house three times – but never lived in it

Listings indicate there are five bedrooms as well as seven full and two half bathrooms between the approximately 4,900 square-foot single-story main house and a detached guesthouse. 

Inside the main sprawling ranch-style home, which is partly clad in the same red brick that covers the driveway, there's lots of rooms with plenty of space for storage and furniture. 

The carpeted living room is airy with a large fireplace as its focal point. Sunlight floods through the huge windows and numerous skylights in the vaulted ceiling, filling the space with light. 

Meanwhile, polished flooring leads into the kitchen, which mixes wood cabinets with decorative pops of sky-blue paint. There are also practical grey countertops and stylish blue hanging lights filling the space.

Another of the main house's rooms has been converted to an oak-panelled room with a breakfast bar area and built-in TV perfect for entertaining guests.

While the light-filled master suite offers a fireplace, a private garden, a Zen-inspired bathroom and a huge, lavishly fitted walk-in closet. 

It comes after Simon, who is recovering from breaking his back following a freak accident on a new electric bike in Malibu, was reported to be selling another Beverly Hills home, said to be worth $23million.

The mogul bought the six-bed pad back in 2004 before he met his long-term partner Lauren Silverman, 42, and had his now six-year-old son Eric.

Although it is thought that he will part with this house, Simon is keeping hold of his $24million Malibu beachfront home, reports The Sun. 

A source told the publication: ‘The LA house was his dream for a while but it holds one too many showbiz memories.

‘Now he has son Eric and long-term partner Lauren he wants to lead a simpler life and create new memories not revolving around rock ’n’ roll, TV or parties’.

Simon's home is in the Beverly Hills area and boasts a pool and a gym as well as a live-in butlers quarters. 

Real estate: Simon reportedly purchased Leona's former home in the Hidden Hills area of LA and sold it on for a $200,000 loss (pictured the back garden area of the $3.9million house)

He is also thought to have a spa at the house with a wet steam room and tanning salon, according to the Pinnacle List.  

Although it is thought that he will try and sell this house, Simon is keeping hold of his Malibu beachfront home.

He bought the house in 2017 and it boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms spread over 10,000 square feet.  

Simon also has two homes in London, worth around £25million, and a place in New York City.
