'I mostly go on my gut and my instinct,' he said. 'I like to challenge the system and see what I can do differently.'

Perry said that he 'had no mentors' on his way to the top, and has learned on the fly.

'You got to understand, I had no mentors,' Perry told Forbes. 'My father doesn’t know anything about business, and my uncles and mother, they know nothing about this. I didn’t go to business school. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned in progress.'

According to BET, Perry joins a list of Black billionaires that includes Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Jay-Z, Robert F. Smith and David Stewart.
