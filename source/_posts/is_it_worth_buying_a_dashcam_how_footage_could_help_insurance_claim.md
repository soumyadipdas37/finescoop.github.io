The popularity of dashcams has sky-rocketed in recent years, with motorists using the devices to protect themselves on the road, deter thieves and capture unusual behaviour.

Their increased use has had a positive impact for drivers who have faced insurance claim disputes, according to a study,

A poll of motorists found that a third who use dashcams in their cars - or cameras attached to motorcycle helmets - have successfully proved they were not at fault for an incident on the road by submitting footage to their insurer.

Dashcam to the rescue: A third of motorists who have uploaded video footage of incidents when making claims said the clips helped to prove they were not at fault for incidents 

It is estimated that around three million drivers in the UK own a dashcam or videoing device that can be attached to a bike helmet.

Comparison site Money Expert surveyed more than 2,000 licence holders and found that 33 per cent used clips captured on these cameras when making an insurance claim and proved they were not in the wrong.

The majority of users of dashcams (70 per cent) said they had bought one of the devices to catch road traffic collisions on film.

One in five people said that they felt installing a dashcam made them a better driver. 

Almost half of these people said it made them more alert while over 40 per cent said it was a confidence booster for when they are behind the wheel.

'This could simply be because there is now a tiny digital witness to our own road rage outbursts or because it saves us money,' said the comparison site.  

'Either way, dashcams appear to be catching on, and catching us in the act.'

The popularity of dashcams has sky-rocketed in recent years, with motorists using the devices to protect themselves on the road, deter thieves and capture unusual behaviour on the road

But there is another significant financial reason why drivers should be contemplating a dashcam.  

Most insurance providers who offer discounts to those with dashcams usually shave between 10 per cent and 12.5 per cent off the price of policies, though smaller insurers who target young motorists will slice 20 per cent off the cost of cover if the customer says they will always have one of the videoing devices installed in their cars.  

One in five drivers polled said they purchased a camera for their car because they knew it would reduce the cost of their premiums. 

And Money Expert said dashcams could drive down the cost of motor insurance in the near future as over half of those surveyed (54 per cent) said they should become a legal requirement for drivers, with more than two in five (44 per cent) expecting to see the law changed in the next few years.

Dashcams aim to catch collisions, vandals, and road rage incidents. 

Manufacturer Nextbase in July 2018 set up the National Dash Cam Safety Portal, which allows road users to upload film of incidents for the police to review and use as evidence. 

This is Money revealed in March that around 10,000 cases of dangerous driving captured on dashcams were uploaded to the police database in the first 20 months of it going live.

Of these, roughly half have resulted in police action, though some experts claimed that too much footage is being uploaded to the system and police forces simply don't have the resources to examine all the videos.

Although road rage normally presents itself in the form of a few choice words and hand gestures, it can be a more serious matter. 

A report published by the Department of Transport in 2018 revealed that over the previous three years, more than 5,280 people were either seriously injured or killed because of angry driving and road rage.
