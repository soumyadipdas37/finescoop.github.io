She is gearing up for the release of her new romantic comedy The Broken Hearts Gallery.

But Selena Gomez warned her fans on Monday not to underestimate the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The 28-year-old actress and singer stressed that 'COVID-19 is not fake news' in an Instagram post where she shared the newest trailer for the upcoming film, which features her newest song.

Selena sounded excited as she reminded her 192 million followers that the romantic film would be coming to theaters on Friday, even though many theaters in the US remain closed due to the pandemic.

'@brokenheartsgallery finally comes out on Friday! I am excited to produce a film directed and written by a first time female filmmaker @nkrinsky [Natalie Krinsky],' she began her caption. 

But she also reminded her fans that just because some of them can see it in a theater doesn't mean it's necessarily a safe choice. 

'Although you can see this movie in some theaters, remember that COVID-19 is not fake news -so please follow safety guidelines in order to enjoy the movie experience with the lowest risk possible,' she wrote, before noting that the trailer features her new song Souvenir.

The real deal: Selena unveiled the trailer while cautioning that 'COVID-19 is not fake news.' The film will be in theaters Friday, though many are still closed throughout the US

Mixed bag: Doctors interviewed by Vulture and The Playlist have been cautious about returning to theaters, and new filtration systems promised by AMC will only be installed in some theaters

In late August, Vulture spoke with Dr. Robert Lahita, the chairman of medicine at St. Joseph’s Health in New Jersey and a professor of medicine at New York Medical College, who raised concerns about the safety of theaters and urged any moviegoers not to eat or drink and not to remove their masks for any reason.

Although most major chains announced they would require masks after being publicly shamed, viewers will still be able to remove them for eating and drinking, which will leave them unprotected and allow them to potentially infect others. 

A follow-up consultation with medical experts in The Playlist indicated that plans to install new air filtration systems in theaters from AMC and other major changes might leave many theaters behind.

The final trailer features Lucy's friend teasing her about her bad luck with relationships.

But she finds a new love growing after she meets Nick (Stranger Things' Dacre Montgomery), and the two create the Broken Hearts Gallery in his massive apartment with all the reminders of her past relationships.
