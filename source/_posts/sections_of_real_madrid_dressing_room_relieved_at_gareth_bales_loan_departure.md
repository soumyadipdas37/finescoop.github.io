Sections of the Real Madrid dressing room were reportedly relieved at Gareth Bale's loan departure.

Bale is set to rejoin Tottenham on loan for the season, but his departure wasn't a particularly solemn occasion for much of the Real squad, as reported by AS.

The report states that Bale didn't say goodbye personally to all of his Real team-mates as he collected his belongings prior to his return to the Premier League.

Bale is set to rejoin Tottenham on loan for the season as he looks to play regularly again

Bale had fallen out of favour at Real; often being overlooked by Zinedine Zidane, and is said to have not had much of a connection with some of his colleagues.

During his seven years at The Bernabeu Bale has won an array of trophies including four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, the Copa del Rey and three Club World Cups.

Bale won an array of trophies at Real Madrid but fell out of favour, especially last season

He has scored 105 goals in 251 games for the club but made just 16 league appearances last season and was desperate to play regularly again.

Bale is set to earn over £13million in wages as part of his loan deal and he is set to be joined at Tottenham by Sergio Reguilon, who was on loan at Sevilla from Real last season. 

During his initial spell at Tottenham Bale became a club hero despite a slow start and he was outstanding during the 2012-13 campaign, scoring 21 goals in the Premier League.
