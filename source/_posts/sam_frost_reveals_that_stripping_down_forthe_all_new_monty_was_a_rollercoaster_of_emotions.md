'It is amazing how many things that you’ve forgotten about bubble to the surface when you’re doing something new and being outside your comfort zone,' she told the publication. 

'It was a rollercoaster, to be honest,' she continued.

The former Bachelorette added that her lack of dancing skills didn't do anything to help. 

Confidence: The 31-year-old actress explained that doing the charity burlesque show brought up a lot of her body insecurities

'I’m not a dancer , I was completely out of my comfort zone. A lot of anxieties about self-worth came up.'  

However, the blonde bombshell revealed on The Morning Show on Friday, that knowing she was stripping for a good cause helped her overcome many of her previous body insecurities.  

'I think as females, we all have our own insecurities and it is really daunting to have to strip on TV and then in front of a large crowd,' she said. 

Support: Sam also credited her co-stars, including singer Danielle Spencer (right), with supporting her during rehearsals and in the lead-up to the live performance

'I think one of the biggest things that I was constantly reminded of was why were we doing it and it was breast cancer awareness.' 

She added:  'Any time I would start stressing out or feel insecure or anxious, I would think of the greater picture.'
