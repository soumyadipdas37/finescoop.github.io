She split from from husband Matthew Robertson in 2017 after 17 years together, and is now dating her longtime friend Michael Douglas. 

And, Davina McCall, 52, has said she 'still enjoys orgasms' and feels like 'a foxy minx' as she revealed that she's had her nipple re-pierced, as she graced the cover of Women's Health.

The presenter - who is mum to three children, Holly, 18, Tilly, 16 and Chester, 13, from her former marriage - also pointed to a 'story behind the sadness' of her post-divorce weight loss, as she showcased her abs for the cover shoot.  

Foxy minx! Davina McCall, 52, has said she 'still enjoys orgasms' and feels like 'a foxy minx' as she revealed that she's had her nipple re-pierced, as she graced the cover of Women's Health

Discussing life after 50, Davina told Women's Health: 'I don't look as good naked as I did in my twenties. But I feel better, and that's the difference.

'I walk around like a foxy minx now because I feel like a foxy minx. 

'Women over 50 feel sexy, we can dress sexily and we can wear underwear and we still enjoy orgasms...

'People say, "Oh, it's all gone…menopause…you're finished with your wizened, dried-up ovaries." I feel like it's really important to say that people in their fifties are having the time of their lives.'

Looking good: 'I don't look as good naked as I did in my twenties. But I feel better, and that's the difference. 'I walk around like a foxy minx now because I feel like a foxy minx!' she asserted 

Explaining the effects of experiencing menopause at 44, Davina said: 'My phone was in the fridge and my keys were in the bin.

'My night sweats became so bad. I just never slept through. I couldn't read Autocue,' but the presenter found instant relief from HRT.

She said: 'From the minute I put the little [hormone replacement therapy] patch on – boom, sleep. Oh my god, the joy. I felt like I was back.'

On being classed as an 'older' woman, the TV presenter admitted: 'I feel like whenever people start trying to put me in that box, it makes me want to be really naughty.

'I feel like running around flicking everybody the bird…I want to do something outlandish and unexpected and outrageous.'

The podcast host - who has had her nipple re-pierced - recalled: 'I [first] pierced my nipple when I was 24 or 25 and I really liked it. Then, it was, like, very avant- garde.'

Davina - who famously lost a notable amount of weight following the end of her marriage to Matthew - admitted there is a 'story behind the sadness' of her divorce diet. 

She said: 'It's called the divorce diet, where you just literally shed [weight]. It happens to so many people I know. It was nothing I did. I was just running on adrenaline.

'Quite a few people [understood] and were like, "I think she's having a hard time, maybe we should lay off." But there were lots of people who didn't.

'There are some really mean people out there and there are also some very uninformed people who don't think about the story behind the sadness.'
