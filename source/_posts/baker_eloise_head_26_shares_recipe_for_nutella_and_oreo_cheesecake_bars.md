A self-taught baker followed by hundreds of thousands on social media has shared a simple recipe for Nutella and Oreo cheesecake bars which can be made in less than 10 minutes without an oven.

It's the latest video from Eloise Head, the founder of FitWaffle Kitchen, a popular Instagram page dedicated to decadent desserts that can be made by people of all skill levels - even beginners.

In the clip, the 26-year-old from London whips up a tray of luscious cheesecake-inspired snacks with the two iconic sweets and three other supermarket ingredients: butter, cream and icing sugar.

Ms Head said the bars are 'quick and easy' to make and must be tried by anyone who loves Nutella.

To make the base, Ms Head mixes 280 grams of Oreos with 100 grams of melted butter, then presses the mixture into the base of a baking tray lined with grease-proof paper which she leaves in the fridge to set.

For the filling, she whisks 500 grams of cream cheese with 400 grams of Nutella and 70 grams of icing sugar until all ingredients are thick and smooth.

Then she loads the mix over the base and decorates with halved Oreos before refrigerating for a further six hours.

Photos of the cheesecake-inspired snacks have amassed almost 13,000 likes and hundreds of responses since they were shared on Friday, with comments including 'oh my god', 'yum' and 'I'll be making these soon'.

'Wow so tempting, you just made my Friday,' one woman said. 

The cheesecake clip is one of Ms Head's latest posts, following a video showing viewers a simple way to make red velvet brownies which quickly went viral with hundreds calling it her best recipe ever.

In it, the amateur chef whips up a batch of brownies with basic supermarket ingredients like butter, sugar, eggs, flour, vanilla extract and white chocolate chips, along with food colouring to give the treats a striking ruby hue.

Ms Head said while she's a 'big fan' of the cream cheese icing, it's entirely optional - the brownies still taste delicious without.

To make them, whisk the melted butter with granulated sugar, then add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract and red food colouring.

Next, add flour and cocoa powder and fold in gently. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice, stir once, then add the white chocolate chips, folding them into the mixture to ensure they're evenly spread throughout.

Once well folded, spoon the mixture into a baking tray lined with parchment paper and leave in an oven set to 160 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes before turning your attention to the cream cheese icing.

To make it, simply whisk butter and cream cheese before adding vanilla extract and icing sugar, sieved in gradually.

Then spoon the mix onto the cooled brownies and smooth until even, before cutting the tray into slices and enjoying for up to three days.

The tutorial drew hundreds of delighted responses, with many tagging their friends begging them to make the brownies at home.

'Please, please someone do this for me,' one woman wrote.

Others praised Ms Head's whisking technique which created perfectly smooth icing. 

'I always struggle with cream cheese frosting going lumpy – yours looks so nice and smooth and thick,' said one.
