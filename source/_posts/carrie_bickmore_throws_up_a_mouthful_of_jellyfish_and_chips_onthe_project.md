Carrie Bickmore was left gagging on an exotic dish during Tuesday's episode of The Project. 

The host sampled jellyfish and chips after a segment on sustainable fishing, with experts suggesting jellyfish were a more environmentally friendly alternative to the usual fish and chips. 

But while the 39-year-old was impressed by the benefits of the dish, which helps alleviate the pressure on endangered fish species, she found she could not quite stomach it.

Carrie showed off her meal, which featured seasoned strips of jellyfish and chips in a box. 

She screwed up her nose and complained: 'To me, that's already making me feel queasy'. 

Carrie took a mouthful, reacting very strongly, shaking as if she were about to have a seizure. 

Good for the planet! The host sampled jellyfish and chips after a segment on sustainable fishing, with experts suggesting jellyfish were a more environmentally friendly alternative to the usual fish and chips

She screwed up her nose and complained: 'To me, that's already making me feel queasy'

'It's the sliminess!' she cried out, shaking her hands, 'It's the texture...! It's all those little slidy things.'

Her co-star Waleed Aly insisted it tasted alright to him, so she decided to give it another go, saying she didn't want to offend the chef who made it.  

'It's not good!' she mumbled, as the jellyfish strips dripped from her mouth, before she threw it back up into the container. 

Oh dear: Carrie took a mouthful, reacting very strongly, shaking as if she were about to have a seizure. 'It's the sliminess!' she cried out, shaking her hands, 'It's the texture...! It's all those little slidy things' 

Oh well she tried: 'It's not good!' she mumbled, as the jellyfish strips dripped from her mouth, before she threw it back up into the container

'Carrie!' Waleed chastised her, to which Carrie clarified: 'It's the texture. The flavour's beautiful.' 

Guest host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald tried the fried tempura version, and said it was 'horrible'. 

Host Peter Helliar meanwhile described it was very salty, before joking, 'You can use the tentacles to floss afterwards, as well!' 

Try again sometime! 'Carrie!' Waleed chastised her, to which Carrie clarified: 'It's the texture. The flavour's beautiful'
