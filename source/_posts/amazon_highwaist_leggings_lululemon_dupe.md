Amazon is a great place to find some fashion gems, with plenty of dupes for designer items available if you're prepared to do a bit of hunting.

The CRZ YOGA Women's Naked Feeling Gym Leggings have caught the attention of hundreds of Amazon shoppers, thanks to their impressive quality and incredibly flattering fit. In fact, the CRZ Leggings have caused a bit of a storm among reviewers online, with many comparing the quality to Lululemon leggings - but with a far more reasonable price tag. 

The £18 leggings have more than 2,000 reviews on Amazon, nearly three-quarters of which award them a full five stars.

The £18 CRZ YOGA Women's Naked Feeling Gym Leggings are being snapped up in a range of colours and sizes from 6 to 18 

Finding a pair of soft, sweat-wicking leggings that are also squat proof and super comfortable is no-mean feat, especially when you're on a budget. 

At only £18, the CRZ YOGA Women's Naked Feeling Gym Leggings show that you don't need to spend a fortune for high-quality leggings, with shoppers raving about its 'buttery soft' texture and 'super flattering fit'. In fact, there are hundreds of Amazon reviews that have compared the quality to that of £88 leggings. 

'These leggings are amazing! I am leggings junkie so I am quite obsessed with finding a good pair of training leggings. These are so soft and buttery. They are honestly as good as Lululemon and Sweaty Betty. They defo feel like a second skin and the best part they are squat proof. I went for a run yesterday and I am happy to report that they stay up and keep everything in the right places.'

Another agreed, raving: 'Must buy!! I spent ages researching the best lulu lemon dupes and these were my top pic! They came way sooner then expected.. fit is amazing, buttery soft. They are not fully sweat proof, but value for money is incredible. I will be recommending these to a lot of people.'

While perhaps not as sweat-wicking as more expensive brands, the soft-hand feel is very similar. Designed with a Spandex blend, the CRZ leggings are soft and stretchy, giving you that naked feeling, so you're free to run, squat and lunge without restriction. The high-rise fit means you're tummy is pulled in and supported too. 

The high-waist band cinches you in helping you feel supported while the side pockets are handy for keeping gym essentials like your phone, keys and card 

'Call off the search, these are the perfect leggings. I never review things, but after trying what seems to be a million different types of leggings I honestly feel like I’ve hit the jackpot with these'.

The leggings flattering fit is consistently mentioned in the reviews with Amazon shoppers praising the form and fit. The pockets are a handy feature too with enough room to hold your phone, keys or card. 

'Lovely pair of leggings!! So comfy and so pretty! I got mine in a size 14 and they fit perfectly, they were tight but in the way that workout leggings should be, not uncomfortable at all. Also they were super flattering, actually made me look like I had a figure! Highly recommend!.'

Another raved: 'Comparable to Lululemon. A Youtuber reviewed a bunch of Lululemon dupes and this was one of the recommended ones. It is extremely comfortable and I love the wide selection of colours. Aside from working out I also wear leggings for hiking. Once this pass the hiking test, these'll be the only leggings I'll be buying for years to come.'
