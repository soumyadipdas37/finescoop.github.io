They've been friends for years and were rumored to have dated nearly eight years ago.

And Sofia Richie and her pal Jaden Smith reunited for a fun day at the beach in Los Angeles on Saturday.

The model and the rapper, both 22, later ventured up to the swanky Japanese restaurant Nobu in Malibu for a double date with their friend Moises Arias and his girlfriend. 

Having a blast: Sofia Richie showed off her stunning figure in a pink bikini while frolicking on the beach in LA with her friend Jaden Smith. Later, the two had a double date at Nobu in Malibu

Sofia grinned ear to ear while running through the cool water as Los Angeles experienced a heat wave.

She wore a halter top triangle bikini in a hot pink design covered in lovely white flowers. 

The 5ft6in beauty paired the top with high-cut bottoms, and she also brought along a pair of stylish slim sunglasses to block out the oppressive sun.

The blonde beauty wore what appeared to be a watch strapped around her ankle, and she had on multiple necklaces and bracelets. 

Jaden matched her in pink swim trunks with flower and rainbow designs on the front.
