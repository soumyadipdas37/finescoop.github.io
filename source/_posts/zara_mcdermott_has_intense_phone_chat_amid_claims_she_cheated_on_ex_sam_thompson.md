While Zara has yet to publicly confirm or deny claims she cheated on former beau Sam, she has been sharing cryptic quotes on social media.

On Thursday, the TV star shared a snap of herself lounging on a sun bed in a turquoise bikini, which was from her recent getaway to Rome.

She simply captioned the image: 'Throwback to Rome [sad face emoji] @ohpolly.'

Elsewhere on social media, Zara shared another cryptic post about love following her shock split from ex-boyfriend Sam.

On Wednesday, she took to Instagram Stories to post two emotive quotes after it was revealed the couple's relationship was hanging in the balance after Sam learned his girlfriend had cheated.

Her first said: 'Love always won in the end. No matter how it happened, no matter what it took, no matter what it meant. Fair or not, true or not. Love won.'

Adding a sad face emoji, Zara's second post then stated: 'We have all hurt someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. We have all loved someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident.

'It is an intrinsic human trait, and a deep responsibility, I think, to be an organ and a blade. But, learning to forgive ourselves and others because we have not chosen wisely is what makes us most human.

'We make horrible mistakes, it's how we learn. We breathe love, it's how we learn, and it is inevitable.' 

Zara's posts come after a source revealed to MailOnline that a tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity.

The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.

At this point, she had been in a relationship with Sam for several months – but it's said the Made In Chelsea star has only recently found out about the infidelity.
