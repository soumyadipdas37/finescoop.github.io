She welcomed her daughter, Kitty, in late 2010 after undergoing IVF treatment.

And on Friday, Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed that because she's no longer married to Kitty's father, Lee Henderson, she would have to ask his permission if she wants to use their embryos to have another child.

The 45-year-old made the admission during a conversation with pregnant IVF nurse on The Kyle and Jackie O Show. 

 

Ex's approval: Jackie 'O' Henderson says she will need her ex husband Lee's permission to have another child through IVF in a conversation with a pregnant IVF nurse on Friday

 'I've just had one [child] myself. I'm happy with just having one,' she said.

Her co-host Kyle Sandilands asked if she wanted to have another child, but Jackie said she it was too late. 

'No, no. Too late now, I think it might be,' she replied, which prompted the IVF nurse to ask if Jackie still had any frozen embryos.

Over: The nurse asked if she still had embryos and seemingly suggested she could help the KIIS FM star to have another  baby. But Jackie said: 'I have embryos babe, but I'm not with him (Lee) anymore'. Pictured is Jackie and Lee before their 2018 split

 'I have embryos, babe, but I'm not with [Lee] anymore,' Jackie answered. 

The nurse explained that all Jackie would need to do to use the embryos is provide a consent form signed by Lee - because the child would be biologically his.

Kyle boldly volunteered to help arrange this, and even the nurse hinted that she could possibly provide assistance.

But Jackie declined the offer and said she didn't want 'IVF for free'.

In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a fertility treatment in which the egg and sperm are combined outside of the body in a specialised laboratory. 

The procedure is performed on women who are past their peak reproductive years and are struggling to conceive naturally.

The process begins with a woman undergoing several follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) injections to produce more eggs, which are then collected during ovulation (at least ten to 30 eggs). 

The eggs are then fertilised with sperm (from her partner or a donor) and grown in a protected environment over a few days, before the embryo is then implanted in the woman's uterus.

Any extra embryos can be stored and frozen for future use.

A blood test will be taken two weeks after the transfer to find out the results.
