Nicole Kidman is filming $100 million Hulu production, Nine Perfect Strangers, in Byron Bay and the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.

And not only is the Oscar winner staying in a $20,000 a week 'eco-mansion', her production has reportedly leased large amount of properties in the area.

Nicole's latest TV project has apparently taken 60 holiday homes and rentals off the market for the duration of its production.

Set in fictionalised wellness resort 'Tranquillum', Nine Perfect Strangers is being partially filmed at real luxury retreat, Soma Byron Bay.  

Local Ray White real estate agent Matthew McCormack told Daily Mail Australia: 'Nicole Kidman's show took 60 houses for six months - that's a $100 million project, and it's brought a lot of money and people to the area.'  

The various properties, which were not rented through Ray White, will potentially be used as sets, or as accommodation for cast and crew not local to the area.

Nicole has been living in Byron Bay on-and-off with her husband Keith Urban and their two daughters since filming began earlier this year. 

The famous family splashed out on luxury lodgings throughout their stay, renting out a Spanish-style 'eco-mansion' called The Range in Coopers Shoot.

The luxurious property, which is environmentally sustainable, 'sits on 120 acres in the hinterland of Byron Bay' and is believed to cost $20,000 a week.

Nicole and her family are expected to reside in the beach town for the next 15 weeks as she continues to film the Hulu series - which she also stars in.

Nine Perfect Strangers is based on Liane Moriarty's bestselling novel of the same name.

In July, Nicole told The Daily Telegraph, she's 'thrilled' to be able to bring the $100 million production and hundreds of jobs to the local film industry, after it was sent crashing down by the coronavirus pandemic. 

There are three separate productions underway in Byron at the moment, attracting further cast and crew to the region.
