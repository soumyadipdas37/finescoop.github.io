She's the staunch anti-vaxxer who made headlines for her involvement in a Zoom chat with COVID-19 conspiracy theorists last month. 

And amid the flurry of negative headlines, actress Isabel Lucas, 35, looked decidedly frazzled while visiting a cafe in Byron Bay on Sunday. 

The former Home And Away star looked tense as she drank from a wine glass and vented to a female companion across the table.

Furrowing her brow and massaging her temples in apparent frustration, Isabel looked to be in the midst of a very serious discussion. 

After their meal, the women left the cafe and continued their conversation on a nearby sidewalk.  

The Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen star swathed her very slender frame beneath a red floral maxi-dress and a white shawl, which she elegantly draped around her shoulders.

She completed her look with a pair of flat leather sandals, a black backpack, and a grey felted fedora hat. 

The sighting comes just three weeks after Isabel went to great lengths to stay anonymous during a Zoom call with COVID-19 conspiracy theorists and lockdown critics.

Covering her face with a black hoodie and mask and using the alias 'X', the anti-vaxxer told her co-panellists that she needed 'to be careful about being outspoken' because she was a famous Australian film and television actress.

'I'm here, and I don't want to be anonymous, but I am about to start filming a film, and I do need to be careful about being outspoken because you can get dropped from charities, you can lose campaigns with car companies,' Isabel said.

'It has happened to me in recent times for speaking out. I feel careful, and I don't want to elicit any aggressive, threatening responses.

Isabel said she felt '100 per cent called to shine a light on the reality of what's really going on' in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown directives.

Pondering: Isabel looked concerned as she stared thoughtfully into her paper take-away cup 

Feeling tense too? The actress' friend also seemed slightly frustrated at what was being discussed 

'There's a certain level of agenda and darkness that has had authority ... and that has had a lot of people believing lies,' she said in the Zoom chat with other well-known figures in the anti-lockdown and anti-mask community.

She also claimed that she met several doctors while living in California who dropped out of the medical field due to 'corruption'. 

'All of what they were speaking about is what we're facing right now. When we are in a fear state, we just follow what we're told'.

Isabel said that at the beginning of the pandemic in March she was asked by her local council to film a video calling on locals to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus. 

After signing on for the campaign, Isabel revealed that she regretted appearing in the clip during the Zoom chat.

'I saw that there was all these other great people doing it and it's that sort of thing where you can get looped in without realising you're being looped in,' she said.

'But those with a strong conscience and strong integrity won't as easily sell out.'
