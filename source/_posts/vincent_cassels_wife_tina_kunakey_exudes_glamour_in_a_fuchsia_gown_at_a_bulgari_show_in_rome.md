She recently flaunted her model frame in tiny bikinis during a sun-soaked break to Mykonos in Greece.

And Tina Kunakey proved she can rock any ensemble as she donned a glamorous fuchsia ballgown for the Bulgari Barocco fashion show on Monday. 

The model, 23, looked sensational in a fitted halterneck dress as she joined Poppy Delevinge and Lady Kitty Spencer for the star-studded event in Rome, Italy.

Tina perfectly showcased her toned legs and slim frame in her eye-catching ensemble which she paired with a selection of sparkling jewels

The French beauty wore her hair slicked back and let her pink dress do all the talking as she posed up a storm during the event.

Meanwhile, Poppy put on a racy display in her semi-sheer dress which featured several beaded frills over the skirt.

Work it! The French model, who is married to Vincent Cassel, slicked her hair back for the event to ensure all eyes were on her stunning dress and sparkling jewels

Her detailed gown also boasted a lace bodice complete with chic satin piping to create a corset-style effect.

Poppy also added some glitz to her ensemble, as only fitting at the designer's jewellery event, with a stunning chocker necklace. 

Also joining the models at the fashion show was Lady Kitty Spencer, who like Poppy opted for a classic black dress.

Confident: Poppy opted for a semi-sheer outfit which boasted a lace pattern over the bodice and satin piping

Beauty: The model wore her blonde locks down and added a full face of makeup including a slick of pretty pink lipstick

Elegant: Lady Kitty Spencer showcased her slim figure in a polka-dot gown with a full skirt and corset top 

Staying safe: Poppy and Lady Kitty ensured to keep their mirrored stools a distance apart as they enjoyed the event in their finest evening wear 

Lady Kitty wore her blonde locks down for the evening and made sure to accentuate her slim frame with a corset top before wowing with a full-skirt. 

In April 2019, Tina and her husband Vincent welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Amazonie.

Vincent announced the birth, his third child but first with Tina, in a sweet Instagram post entitled 'Amazonie est née (Amazonie is born).'

The baby's name is an apparent tribute to Brazil, where the happy couple reside for part of the year, though Vincent had shared the image from Paris, France.

Tina and The Black Swan actor announced their pregnancy in a sweet Instagram post in January last year, just four months after their wedding. 

The couple posed on a beach during their romantic getaway to Bahia, with Vincent cradling his wife's growing belly, to break the news to fans.

Vincent and Tina married in a private ceremony at the city hall in Bidart, south-west France, on August 24 2018.

The couple were first linked back in July 2016 when Tina, then 19, shared a social media snap of herself cuddling up to the then 49-year-old actor while smoking a cigarette.
