The new series of Top Gear sees the audience take part in a drive-in on the runway of the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey.

And co-hosts Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris spoke to Radio Times on Tuesday about the new format, which has been introduced amid the coronavirus crisis. 

The TV presenter, 47, gushed about the new setting, saying it 'actually felt right' to have something similar to a drive-in cinema.

Excited: Top Gear co-host Paddy McGuinness said on Tuesday that having a drive-in audience 'felt right' and said show bosses might keep format even after the coronavirus pandemic ends

He explained: 'It worked out really well, so much so that we might end up keeping it in the future.'

Instead of standing huddled in the hangar at the Aerodome, fans now watch the episodes from inside their cars in accordance with social distancing measures, and they also watch the trio discuss the show from a makeshift stage. 

Chris reiterated Paddy's sentiment, as he added: 'The studio format was set up by the previous lot, who did it brilliantly – but we inherited it. This felt like something new.'

The upcoming series only resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted production of the hit BBC car show.  

Earlier this month, Top Gear released a first look trailer with hosts Paddy, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris ahead of the new series.

In the 60-second adrenaline-pumping video, it features Paddy's dramatic car crash where he lost control of a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo in June.

As well as Paddy's car crash, the trailer shows the comedian risking his life once again in a daring wall of death challenge.

Arriving at the dare-devil stunt, Paddy quips: 'They've gone, "How can we get the ratings? We'll kill them all!"' 

It then shows the Take Me Out star zooming around a motordrome in an old insurance write-off, a Porsche Cayman, as he warns: 'This does not feel good!'  

While Freddie and Chris look on in horror as they shout: 'No, no, no!'

Yet this isn't the only dangerous stunt for Paddy and he is also shown zooming across head-first on a zip-wire in north Wales. 

The start date for the new series still remains unknown but it is expected to return later this year.
