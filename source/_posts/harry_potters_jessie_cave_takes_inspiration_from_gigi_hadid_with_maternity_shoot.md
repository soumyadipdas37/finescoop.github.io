She was recently hospitalised after struggling with headaches, heart palpitations and swollen ankles during her pregnancy.

But Jessie Cave appeared to be on the mend as she shared radiant images from an impromptu shoot from her home on Instagram on Wednesday.

The Harry Potter star, 33, took inspiration from mum-to-be and supermodel Gigi Hadid's recent maternity images as she cradled her bare baby bump in a series of stunning photos.

Jessie captioned her images: 'Just another day trying to be Gigi Hadid..... Thanks to my glam team @bebecave for her “fox eye make up” and the amazing photographer @alfiebrowncomedian.

Catwalk queen Gigi, 25, is currently gearing up for the arrival of her first child with her partner Zayn Malik. 

In June, Jessie surprised fans as she revealed she and partner Alfie Brown were expecting their third child together.

In a sweet announcement post, the TV and stage star looked as radiant as ever as her son Donnie, five, and daughter Margot, three, lovingly cradled her baby bump.

'Oops I did it again', the thespian captioned her post, alongside a fallen leaf emoji, seemingly hinting at her baby's autumn due date.    

Earlier this year, stand-up star Alfie revealed he and Jessie rekindled their relationship after splitting up when their youngest child was only 10 weeks old. 

On maintaining a healthy work-life balance, the media personality told Bustle in 2018: 'I learned pretty early on you can’t do much work with children around. 

'When they were babies maybe, but now they don’t sleep so I’m basically on my feet the entire day. My mum is brilliant; she helps me most days. 

'And, actually, up until a few weeks ago I was living with her and my sister. My partner Alfie and I split up when Margot was only 10 weeks old.'
