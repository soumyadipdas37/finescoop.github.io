Megyn Kelly is launching a new podcast called The Megyn Kelly Show.   

The podcast is the former talk show host's latest venture as an independent journalist as she launches her media company called Devil May Care Media. 

Kelly tweeted the news on Thursday, writing: 'Some news: I am launching a podcast this month. It'll be free & available pretty much everywhere. No B.S. No agenda. No corporate overlords. Should be fun!'

The podcast is expected to be launch the week of September 28 with three new episodes per week and guests that are 'newsmakers, thought leaders and compelling voices'. 

Journalist Megyn Kelly is launching a new podcast called The Megyn Kelly Show. This is the former talk show host's latest venture as an independent journalist as she launches her media company Devil May Care Media

Kelly tweeted the news on Thursday, writing: 'Some news: I am launching a podcast this month. It'll be free & available pretty much everywhere. No B.S. No agenda. No corporate overlords. Should be fun!'

Kelly said in a press release, 'Every journalist's dream is to cover the biggest stories and talk to the most interesting people without the shadow of a politicized media institution hanging over them. That's what I'm about to do. 

'With Devil May Care Media, I answer only to my audience and my conscience. Those who like what I have to say will find the experience deeply rewarding. Those who don't can look elsewhere. 

'The point is to give the audience authentic content that goes places where traditional media can't or - more often - won't. It's a great challenge that will reconnect me with my audience and I'm excited to get started.'

The name Devil May Care Media is a slight dig at mainstream media, with the full saying as 'the devil may care, but I do not'. 

It's meant to show that Kelly's company is not limited to talking about difficult issues in the way mainstream news outlets may be.  

In addition to the podcast, the media company will also produce other shows discussing the latest news, current events, legal and cultural issues with the same 'tough, fair, smart perspective that has made Kelly one of America's most respected broadcast journalists,' according to a press release.   

Kelly was previously a star at both Fox News as a host for 12 years and NBC, where she had her own talk show until 2018

Steve Krakauer is the executive producer and the show will be in conjunction with production company Red Seat Ventures

Kelly told the Wall Street Journal, 'The number one thing I wanted to do was control my own editorial. To not be doing anyone else's bidding, not having the pressure of corporate overlords over me, that means one has to be entrepreneurial.'

'I don't want the political pressures of working for someone who's dedicated to taking down Trump or defending him. I don't want pressure to not say the right thing because it's going to tick off one group or another,' she said. 'You can't criticize Black Lives Matter because it's going to upset some corporate sponsor. You can't have an honest conversation about transgender rights without upsetting one group or another.' 

She was previously a star at both Fox News as a host for 12 years and NBC, where she had her own talk show until 2018. 

Now she's making her own rules for her show where listeners can expect interviews that 'transcend the superficiality and sound-bite driven confines of traditional broadcast and cable news, and instead deliver in-depth, uncensored, thought-provoking conversations.' 

Steve Krakauer is the executive producer and the show will be in conjunction with production company Red Seat Ventures.
