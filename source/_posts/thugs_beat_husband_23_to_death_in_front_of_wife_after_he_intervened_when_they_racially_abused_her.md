Two thugs beat a husband to death in front of his wife after he intervened when they racially abused her, a court has heard.

Amaan Momand, 23, died from serious head injuries in September last year, three days after he was attacked in the Maypole area of Birmingham.

His wife, Halima Hussain, told police the attack started shortly after Jamie Taylor, 22, called her a 'p*** c***,' as she crossed the road. 

Taylor, joined by 18-year-old Taylor Pountney, allegedly returned and attacked Amaan, after he tried to intervene in the row. 

Both Taylor, from Kings Heath, and Pountney, from Yardley, deny a charge of murder. 

A trial at Coventry Crown Court heard statements from an interview Ms Hussain gave to police following the attack, which happened near an Iceland supermarket at around 4.40pm on September 19.

In her statement, she said her husband was 'literally beaten to death'.

Mrs Hussain said: 'As I walked into the centre of the road, a car came up and a boy shouted "you p*** c***". 

'I shouted back: "You white c**t," the car carried on driving.

'I carried on walking, me and my partner were saying stuff like' "It's racist, it's not nice, why do people do these things?"

'The car went around the corner and stopped. The boys left the car and started walking towards us.'

Mrs Hussain then described the confrontation which followed. 

Mrs Hussain said: 'The boy came towards us and said: "What the f*** did you say?"

'I said: "You called me a p*** c*** so I called you a white c***".  I said I can't walk, I have sciatica. The boy said: "I don't give a f***".'

Mrs Hussain told police that her husband then tried to intervene saying: 'Why did you try and run her over? She's a woman, she's my wife'.

'The boy said "I'll smash you you m***********".'

Mrs Hussain said she told her husband to 'leave the boy alone, he's just a kid'. Mrs Hussain told police: 'The boy said: "I'm not young I'm 22 I'll knock him out", then the second boy threw a punch at my partner. At my partner's face. My husband's cap fell off.

'Then he went to pick it up but before he got up the other boy kicked him in the side of head.'

Mrs Hussain said the pair then ran off into a car that drove away.

Mrs Hussain tearfully told police: 'I was screaming and crying, there was blood everywhere on the floor.'

She added that as Mr Momand was taken away she was 'so scared because I wanted to be with him'.

Mrs Hussain explained to the interviewing police officer how upset it made her feel to be racially abused.

Flowers were left at the scene of the attack, which allegedly started after Mr Momand intervened when his wife was called a p*** c***

Mrs Hussain said: 'We were just going shopping. Why do we have to get attacked? I don't feel safe in my house anymore.' 

The officer asked if there was any 'warning' the two defendants were  going to be violent towards them.

Mrs Hussain replied: 'He just kept saying: 'I'll f****** smash you' to my husband.'

When the officer asked what Mr Momand had done, Mrs Hussain said: 'Nothing he was just asking: "Why are you saying that to my wife?"'

She then broke off in tears before saying: 'They literally beat him to death.' 

A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Momand died from a head injury.

Reporting restrictions meant Pountney's identity was not initially published as he was 17 at the time of the incident. But he can now be named after turning 18.

The trial is set to last for three to four weeks.
