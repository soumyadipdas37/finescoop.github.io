More than 200 marauding macaque monkeys have been castrated in Thailand after a spate of raids on homes in search of food. 

The primates have roamed freely into the city of Songkhla, meeting little resistance due to the coronavirus lockdown. 

On Tuesday, a team of wildlife conservationists rounded up the imperious imps, drawing them into cages with bait before knocking them unconscious with tranquilizers.

The captured monkeys were marked with numbers so that they can be easily identified in future before being castrated.

Thung Tale Wildlife Conservation officer Suwat Suksiri said: 'We had to have monkeys neutered because the residents said the more wild monkey population means the more problems and conflicts could happen between them.' 

Earlier this year hundreds of the monkeys were sterilised in the central city of Lopburi after their numbers spiralled wildly out of control.

Officials there were seeking to neuter around 500 of the 6,000 animals after they terrorised locals as they engaged in mass street brawls over scraps of food and invaded shops.

People had sought to appease them with junk food, but the sugary diet turned them sex-crazed and they were breeding faster than ever.  

Footage of hundreds of them brawling over food in the streets went viral on social media in March.

Their growing numbers - doubling in three years - have made an uneasy coexistence with their human peers almost intolerable.

Many areas have simply been surrendered to the marauding monkeys.
