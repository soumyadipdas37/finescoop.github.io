Kylie Jenner's best friend Stassie Karanikolaou turned up the summer heat on her Instagram page Tuesday.

The 23-year-old was a sizzling sensation as he bared her cleavage in floral lace lingerie from Rihanna's line Savage X Fenty.

Stassie, who is an ambassador for the brand, teamed a $34.95 unlined bra with a $14.95 pair of cheeky panties for her latest photo-shoot.

She shot her best smoldering stare at the camera as she posed kneeling on a luxurious-looking patio sofa.

Accentuating her unmistakable features with makeup, she wore her dark hair down and added a bit of glitz to the look with earrings and bracelets.

Stassie also swung by her Insta Stories that day to post a video of herself modeling the same underwear in her bathroom mirror.

While she was at it she slipped into a mint-colored $19.95 cotton essentials bra-lette  with its matching $10.95 pair of cheeky panties.

Stassie's smoldering Instagram posts came the same day that Kylie's former best friend Jordyn Woods put up a sultry bikini pinup snap.

Jordyn fell out with the Kardashian family the weekend after Valentine's Day last year when she shared a kiss at a party with NBA dreamboat Tristan Thompson.

The dashing love rat was then dating Khloe Kardashian, with whom he shares his two-year-old daughter True and to whom he was serially unfaithful.

Although Khloe left him after he kissed Jordyn, she went into lockdown with Tristan and True amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Tristan and Khloe are now reportedly on-again, with an Us Weekly source claiming she 'would love to give daughter True a sibling because she is at the perfect age.'

Last year Jordyn went on her family friend Jada Pinkett Smith's show Red Table Talk and took a two-hour lie detector test to deny ever having sex with Tristan. 

Khloe first began dating Tristan when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with his three-year-old firstborn son Prince. 

Although Jordan has claimed she was still with Tristan when he took up with Khloe, Khloe insisted she thought the NBA heartthrob was single at the time.
