Kurt Zouma is being courted by both Everton and Leicester this summer and Chelsea are prepared to cash in on the centre back before the window closes, say reports.

Zouma started alongside Andreas Christensen in the opening two Premier League matches of the season, but the arrival of Thiago Silva from Paris Saint-Germain is expected to drop him out of the starting XI.

With that in mind, Le10 Sport report that Chelsea are willing to cash in on the Frenchman if the right offer comes in, with Leicester and Everton eyeing moves.

Zouma scored against Brighton but has slipped down the pecking order under Frank Lampard

It is believed that Everton are the more interested party, with Zouma having spent a successful loan spell at the club in the 2018-19 season.

Zouma wasn't even in Chelsea's matchday squad for the game against West Brom at the weekend, leading to plenty of speculation surrounding his future.

It has been written that Chelsea would demand a fee in the region of £36million for Zouma should he leave in the summer transfer window.

His current contract runs through until June 2023, leaving Chelsea in a strong negotiating position should they decide to sell the defender.

Antonio Rudiger is another centre back that Chelsea are preparing to offload, with Frank Lampard trying to trim his squad before the October deadline. 

Tottenham are the latest shock club to be linked with the Germany international, who has fallen way down the pecking order under Lampard.
