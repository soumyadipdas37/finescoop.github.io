Strictly pro Katya Jones is reportedly hoping to be paired with boxer Nicola Adams after admitting she would 'love' to be apart of the first same-sex pairing.

The professional dancer, 31, is said to be a 'huge believer in girl power' and is 'telling everyone' how much she wants to be paired with the Olympic gold medallist, 37. 

Katya is also apparently still keen to redeem herself after she was caught kissing her dance partner Seann Walsh, 34, in 2018.

Shockwaves were sent through the Strictly dance floor when married Katya was pictured locking lips with her comedian partner during a pub trip.

A source told The Sun: 'She sees it as a chance to make history but also to redeem herself on the show after her scandal two years ago.

'She's a real girls' girl and is keen to move on from that.'

They continued: 'Equally, show bosses know that Katya will have everyone talking about her and Nicola if they partner them together.'

Katya is said to be 'one of the most competitive dancers' and is keen to 'push the boundaries' on the dancefloor, according to the source. 

Producers decide the celebrity and professional pairings based on height, according to The Sun. 

Katya measures at 5ft 5ins while former professional boxer Nicola stands at 5ft 4ins.   

Earlier this year, Katya told the Sunday Mirror: 'I would love to dance with a woman on the show. I think creatively it would be really interesting and I love coming up with new ideas for stuff. 

It was announced this week that Nicola is set to be in the first same-sex pairing on the BBC show, as she said in a statement: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'

Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.' 

Revealing she approached Strictly with the idea for a same-sex pairing, Nicola explained: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said "yeah I'll do it but I want to dance with another female dance partner.'"

'It's definitely a time for change and time to move on and be more diverse. This is a brilliant step in the right direction. It will be nice for the LGBT community to be able to see that there are same sex couples on the show as well.' 

It's over: The couple's six-year marriage ended in 2018 (pictured together in 2019)

Nicola became the first female amateur boxer to win an Olympic gold medal at London 2012 and became double Olympic champion following her second gold medal win in Rio 2016 as well as being the first boxer in history to retain an Olympic title.    

Katya and 38-year-old Neil Jones's six-year marriage ended in 2019 months after pictures emerged of her kissing her dance partner Seann on a night out.   

At the time, the comedian was dating Rebecca Humphries and Katya was still happily married to now-estranged husband Neil.  

MailOnline has contacted Katya's representatives for comment.
