Kardashian also recently took to Instagram to share a truly worthy cause along with his friend Eric Esrailian. 

'In the fog of the pandemic & global crises, #Armenians in #Artsakh have been the victims of unprovoked attacks by #Azerbaijan,' he began. 

'We appeal to the international community to continue to condemn these attacks. From the highest levels of leadership, we know Armenia & Artsakh want peace,' he added.

He also added any information to the contrary that others may have heard is 'disingenuous and false,' asking fans to go to Anca.org.

He also asked for support for their #ArstakhStrong We Are Our Borders/All For Artsakh campaign at Armeniafund.org/donate as well.

Kardashian and Blac Chyna split in February 2017, with the rapper suing both her ex and Kylie Jenner that year.

Blac Chyna (real name Angela Renee White) filed a motion to dismiss an assault and battery lawsuit filed by Kardashian.

The motion was denied by a judge, but there is no indication on how the lawsuit may proceed from here.
