A furious Piers Morgan clashed with Jeremy Corbyn's brother over his coronavirus conspiracy theories on Good Morning Britain today. 

Piers Corbyn, sibling of the former Labour leader, appeared on the programme following his arrest at a demonstration against lockdown restrictions and vaccination programmes in Trafalgar Square, London. 

Mr Corbyn today claimed the world was the subject of a 'psychological operation to close down the economy in the interest of mega corporations', who, he says, will see a 'massive gain' out of joblessness. 

Presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid, along with the show's resident doctor Hilary Jones, each hit out at Mr Corbyn, with the latter calling the activist 'extremely dangerous'. 

Mr Morgan said the guest was relying on 'conspiracy theorist whackjobs' to back up his positions, grilling him on his beliefs about vaccines, climate change and 5G towers. 

Losing his temper, Piers Morgan said: 'What you're saying is an insult to the families of every single one of the 800,000 plus people who've died from a deadly virus that's swept this planet'

Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers was arrested at a mass-gathering of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists who took to the streets of London to demonstrate against lockdown restrictions and vaccination programmes at the weekend.

The former Labour leader's older brother was filmed being taken away from Trafalgar Square by a gaggle of mask-wearing police officers who hauled him into a van.

It is the third time the decisive anti-lockdown figure has been arrested in just over three months. He was arrested on May 16 and May 30 while protesting in Hyde Park. 

More than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax gathered for the 'Unite for Freedom' rally which started at noon in the capital on Saturday.

Demonstrators called for an 'end to Government lies' and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament.

Met Police announced they arrested a 73-year-old man on suspicion of breaking the new coronavirus health protection regulations at Trafalgar Square. 

Onlookers flocked to social media to share pictures of Mr Corbyn being hauled into the back of a police van at the central-London tourist spot.

Pictures from the demonstration show Trafalgar Square almost full of protesters - none of whom are wearing masks - holding signs that brand the pandemic as a 'hoax'. When full, the square holds up to 35,000 people. 

Other signs claimed masks reduce immunity and likened the restrictions to 'child torture'. One person held a homemade placard on which he had scrawled 'no to mandatory vaccines.'

Mr Corbyn was arrested on May 16 after he used a megaphone to say 'vaccination is not necessary' and '5G towers will be installed everywhere', adding: '5G enhances anyone who's got illness from Covid, so they work together.' 

There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines. 

'800,000 people have died from this virus, of course it exists,' Mr Morgan told Mr Corbyn, adding: 'Nobody's made up Covid-19.'

Piers Corbyn said: 'Well they have actually made up these figures and the government has been caught out in the counting, as you well know.'

Losing his temper, Mr Morgan said: 'What you're saying is an insult to the families of every single one of the 800,000 plus people who've died from a deadly virus that's swept this planet.

'For you to come on national television and tell those families what killed your relative doesn't exist is a slap in the teeth and a load of conspiracy theory whackjob nonsense.'

The host asked Mr Corbyn if he believed Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with coronavirus, invented having the disease. 

Mr Corbyn said: 'I don't know if anyone invented it or not, but I would say that the numbers of people getting whatever they're getting is declining rapidly and there is no justification whatsoever for continuing lockdown.'

Piers Morgan said 25 million people worldwide had tested positive for Covid-19, to which Mr Corbyn said: 'You know and I know that these tests don't work.'

Mr Morgan added: 'Over 800,000 people have now died from Covid-19, that is a demonstrable fact.'

Mr Corbyn replied: 'Well, 800,000 people have died, and they've been labelled Covid when it might have been completely something else.

'It is not a pandemic because the numbers dying are nothing different from a normal year of people dying, where they die all the time.

'Secondly, it is not a high consequence infectious disease, and that was decalred by the government and the World Health Operation on March 19.'

Susanna Reid said that more than 40,000 people in this country had died in Britain as a result of Covid. 

'What an insult to their family, to say it's some kind of fiction to boost international pharmaceutical companies,' she said.

'Well, it is boosting pharmaceutical companies, and big telecom who are making billions and billions out of this while the ordinary British worker is going to the wall,' Mr Corbyn said.  

He went on to say 'you don't need a vaccine, vaccines cause death', adding that there was already a 'cure' for Covid symptoms, namely 'chloroquine and zinc'. 

Mr Morgan then said his guest was stating 'bold lies like hydroxychloroquine being a cure', telling Mr Corbyn he was 'relying on conspiracy theorist whackjobs'.

The host continued: 'What you're saying is an insult to the families of every single one of the people who've died from this virus.'

When asked his opinion on climate change, Mr Corbyn said: 'The sun rules weather and climate, and I can tell you Christmas will be very cold in Britain and we might even have snow here.'

Dr Hilary Jones said Mr Corbyn's statements were 'extremely dangerous' and 'littered with dangerous errors'. 

He said hydroxychloroquine and zinc as a treatment had been 'completely dissed' by 'hundreds of different experts'. 

Dr Hilary added that the virus had been identified by the electron microscope, and this has 'nothing to do' with other viruses we've seen in the last 40 years. 

Demonstrators in the Unite for Freedom rally - which started at noon in the capital - called for an 'end to Government lies' and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament (police pictured at the scene)
