He's sold millions of records, notched up a string of awards and entertained countless fans with his dazzling jazz-pop.

But lifting his wife’s spirits didn’t appear to be in Jamie Cullum’s repertoire – at least if these series of pictures are anything to go by.

Snapped at a restaurant, model Sophie Dahl at first shows a brief flash of her pearly whites as she rests her face on her hand.

But the smile gives way to a more sullen look before she ends up looking decidedly glum.

The cheap decorations hanging off a plastic Christmas tree are unlikely to have helped her mood as she sat at a table with the jazz star. Even a large glass of what appeared to be gin and tonic failed to cheer her up.

But appearances can be deceptive. For starters, December 25 hadn’t come early for the pair – instead they were taking part in a photoshoot for a festive campaign in a restaurant last week.

Dressed up to the nines, Miss Dahl, 43, struck a series of poses for a camera crew shooting from outside Odette’s restaurant in the celebrity haunt of Primrose Hill, North London.

Onlookers couldn’t help but take a peek after seeing the crowds of production staff on the street outside. It’s a mystery as to what campaign Miss Dahl was filming with jazz star Cullum, 41 – famously seven inches shorter than his 5ft 11in wife. Marks & Spencer denied the couple are involved in its festive advert, while sources at John Lewis said the same.

Miss Dahl, who has two daughters Lyra, nine and seven-year-old Margot, with Cullum, has carved herself a career in food after taking a step back from modelling.

The granddaughter of children’s writer Roald Dahl was a contributing editor at Waitrose food magazine and wrote a cookbook, Miss Dahl’s Voluptuous Delights.
