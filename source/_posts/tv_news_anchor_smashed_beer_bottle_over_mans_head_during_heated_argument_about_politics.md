A heated dispute over politics has landed a TV news presenter from South Carolina in jail after police say she smashed a beer bottle over a man's head.

Kamie Roesler, 28, a news anchor with WIS-TV in Columbia, was arrested on a charge of aggravated assault in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on Sunday afternoon.

According to police, Roesler was sitting outside with a group of people at around 4.30pm in the 1100 block of North Prairie Avenue in Sioux Falls when she got into an argument over politics with a 32-year-old man.
