New Chelsea signing Kai Havertz has thanked Fikayo Tomori after the youngster allowed him to take the club's No 29 shirt.

Havertz has worn the No 29 in each season of his senior career since making the breakthrough at Bayer Leverkusen in the 2016-17 campaign.

Tomori had been given the No 29 when he was promoted to the first-team last year but has now switched to No 14.

Tomori has switched to No 14 to let Havertz wear the number he had at Bayer Leverkusen

Havertz, who joined Chelsea for £89million, was grateful to Tomori for making the switch.

On Instagram Havertz posted a picture of his new shirt accompanied by the caption: 'thank you @fiakyotomori - 29.'

According to Sportbild, Havertz passed up a £9million transfer bonus so that he could secure his move to Chelsea.

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has been pleased with Havertz's humble nature since he joined the club.

Lampard told Chelsea's official website: ‘Kai is a really exciting signing for myself and for the club first and foremost.

‘We also have to understand that he is a fantastic young talent but we must give him time to let him settle and let those talents come through.'

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has been impressed with Havertz's attitude in training

‘On his personality, I have been absolutely overwhelmed with how humble and down to earth he is, and how well he wants to do here, and how he is very excited with the challenge. 

'He wants to come here and be a top player for Chelsea, and really prove his talents on this stage.' 

Chelsea commence their Premier League campaign away to Brighton on Monday, with Havertz hoping to make his debut in that fixture.
