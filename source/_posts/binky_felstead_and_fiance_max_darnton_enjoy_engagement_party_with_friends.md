Last month, Binky admitted she wouldn't be with Max if 'marriage wasn't in the plan', but insisted she didn't 'mind' when the couple decide to tie the knot.

The media personality, who shares daughter India with ex Josh Patterson, discussed her romance in an interview with Hello!.

The TV star said: 'I've always wanted to get married, but I never minded when. I've never been one of those girls who have their picture perfect wedding in their head and know what ring they want, but it would be nice to have that one day.'
