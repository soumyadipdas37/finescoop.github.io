A mother has stunned onlookers and sometimes even her own family with her uncanny resemblance to supermodel Kendall Jenner. 

Teona Chachua, 29, from Tbilisi, Georgia, never realized just how much she looked like the reality TV star until she started beauty blogging in 2018, and was suddenly inundated with comments from fans of the Kardashian family member.

In the same year, the 5ft 10in brunette was named the highest paid supermodel by Forbes Magazine - but mother-of-one Teona, who measures up eight inches shorter and is five years older, was left shocked when people started stopping her in the street to tell her she looks like Kendall.

Now Teona's own husband, Giorgi, 29, and her family joke that the pair are somehow related - with the mother-of-one embracing the comparison and describing it as 'a huge confidence boost'.

Mother-of-one Teona (pictured with her husband Giorgi and their daughter Keira, one) measures up eight inches shorter and is five years older than the celebrity

She said: 'As soon as I started my videos and posting pictures people started commenting saying that I look like her. It is nice when you get compared to someone as beautiful as she is.

'Sometimes people double take when they look at me in the street and sometimes even say, "Oh my god you look like Kendall".

'I get a lot of comments especially from her fans who actually think it's her, and my family joke that we are related somehow. It's a bit strange for me as well because at the end of the day I'm just a normal girl.'

The mother-of-one recalled: 'As soon as I started my videos and posting pictures people started commenting saying that I look like her'

'Sometimes she posts pictures on her Instagram and I can understand why everyone says I look like Kendall,' admitted the mother-of-one (pictured)

As well as Kendall Jenner, Teona, who works as a sales rep, has been compared to other stunners such as model Emily Ratajkowski and actress Sandra Bullock.

But after building up her own successful business as a beauty blogger, Teona is proud that she also gets recognition in her hometown for being herself, by her own fan base.

She said: 'When I just post pictures or videos people always compare me to Kendall or Emily Ratajkowski and some people even tell me that I look like Sandra Bullock.

'I do get a confidence boost out of it, but I don't personally think that I look exactly like Kendall. But that's because I know that I'm quite short and she is so tall.

'Sometimes she posts pictures on her Instagram and I can understand why everyone says I look like her.

'She's such a gorgeous lady, my husband likes to joke about it and reminds me that I'm older than Kendall.'
