A woman who deliberately sneezed at a security guard in a shopping mall during the Covid-19 outbreak has been sentenced to 11 weeks in jail today.

Sun Szu-Yen, 46, from Taiwan, sneezed at the guard after she was denied access into Ion Orchard shopping mall on April 12.  

She plead guilty in a district court in June to one count of performing a rash act and an unrelated harassment charge according to The Straits Times.

The judge called for her to be assessed for a mandatory treatment order (MTO), where offenders receive treatment for their mental condition in lieu of jail time.

But she was not found to be suffering from any mental illness. 

Security guard Devika Rani Muthu Krishnan, 56, had to ensure shoppers' were wearing masks and that they gave their details for contact tracing.  

The accused filled out a form but was denied entry for not wearing a mask, and was not allowed in when she tried to use her scarf to cover her face.  

She then sneezed at Ms Devika Rani's direction and scribbled over the details on her form which was caught on CCTV.    

Sun, who represented herself, told the court today that she would like to remain in Singapore where her son is attending school.
