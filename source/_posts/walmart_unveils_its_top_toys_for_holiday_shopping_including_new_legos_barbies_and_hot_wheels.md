Walmart has revealed its list of the top toys ahead of the 2020 holiday season, and they're all kid-tested and kid-approved.

The megachain unveiled the 36 top toys this week, broken down into categories like 'high-tech gadgets,' 'interactive play,' and 'surprise toys' — with highlights including a Sensory FX ASMR Mega Bar, a Disney Princess Vanity, and a Semi-Truck and Trailer Ride On.

What's more, Walmart has introduced the new Walmart Wonder Lab online this year, where kids can play with the toys virtually before buying them. 

Get shoppin'! Walmart has revealed its list of the top toys ahead of the 2020 holiday season, and they're all kid-tested and kid-approved

'This year’s Top-Rated by Kids Toy List reflects the shift we’ve seen in toy trends and behaviors this year,' Steve Ronchetto, vice president of Toys at Walmart, said in a press release. 

'Toys play a critical role in families’ lives as they spend more time at home and parents seek ways to keep kids engaged with learning-based play.

'More than any year before, we’re seeing strong interest across toys that stem from digital platforms, like kid influencer-created toys, interactive and educational toys, screen-free indoor entertainment and toys for active outdoor play,' he added. 

Their list includes all of these categories, as well as several toys that will only be sold at Walmart.
