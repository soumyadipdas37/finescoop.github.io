Lewis Capaldi has reportedly split from his girlfriend Catherine Halliday after seven months of dating because it isn't the right time to settle down.

The apparent break-up may come as a surprise to many after it was claimed earlier this summer that Lewis was 'smitten' with the 21-year-old student.

However they are believed to have now decided to go their separate ways and according to the Sun, Lewis is already on celebrity dating app Raya. 

It's over? Lewis Capaldi has reportedly split from his girlfriend Catherine Halliday after seven months of dating because it isn't the right time to settle down 

A source told the publication: 'Lewis has no hard feelings towards Catherine and they're still amicable but they decided it was best to call it a day. He's at the beginning of his career, with a lot of opportunity at his ­fingertips, so it's not the right time to settle down.

'He wishes Catherine all the best and has fond memories of their dates together.'

In June it was reported that Lewis was so loved-up with girlfriend Catherine that he has penned a song about her on his new album. 

The Scottish star was said to have mentioned her fiery red locks on the 'special' track.

Lewis is currently working on his new album as a follow-up to his award-winning Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent. 

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Lewis's tracks are mostly about love again but this time finding it, not losing it. He's smitten with Catherine and although it's early days, she has a nod on one of the tracks he has written.  

'Lewis mentions her hair and it's really quite special. She's made him realise how to be happy again.'

They added: 'Catherine was obviously made up there is a nod to her. She has something very special with Lewis.'

Lewis revealed he had found love earlier this year when asked by a fan if he preferred being single or in a relationship. He also recently shared that they are missing each other as they self-isolate at separate locations during lockdown. 

He joked: 'I'm in a relationship so if I said the other one, my girlfriend would kill me. 

'I've never told anybody I'm in a relationship, so there you go. She's got red hair, she's got quite a posh voice. And that's that, that's all you're getting.'

It was revealed in February that Lewis had found love with Scottish student Catherine.

The Someone You Loved hitmaker was said to have been seen on a number of low-key dates with the student in his hometown of West Lothian.

According to onlookers, the pair enjoyed a relaxed date at a Prezzo prior to lockdown, and they claimed the duo were 'very flirty' with one another. 

A source speaking to The Sun at the time claimed the pair had a blossoming relationship, they said: 'They were being very flirty and seemed to be having fun — both laughing and joking a lot, touching hands and being tactile.

'You'd never know he was one of the biggest stars in the country and it's a very low key place to go and eat but he obviously doesn't go in for all the fancy celebrity stuff. 

'They were holding hands as they left and went for the car, and Lewis posed for a couple of photos with fans and then climbed into a Fiesta and drove off.'
