Two men accused of murdering boxing prospect and Floyd Mayweather pupil Danny Gonzalez have been arrested while a third remains on the loose, according to California law enforcement.

Riverside County (California) police have announced that Andre Richee, 27, and Lee Mooring, 32, were arrested Thursday for first-degree murder, stemming from the September 7 shooting in Moreno Valley. A motive in the case has not been established publicly. 

Both suspects were also charged with vandalism, while Richee is facing a grand theft of property charge as well. They could face the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder.

Gonzalez was just 3-0 as a professional, but showed enough promise to attract Mayweather

Meanwhile 28-year-old Joseph Goldsmith remains on the loose. A warrant has been issued for his arrest in connection with the shooting.

Gonzalez, 22, was among three males shot in Moreno Valley on September 7, when police received a report of an assault with a deadly weapon.

Deputies arrived shortly thereafter, according to the department, but Gonzalez succumbed to his injuries at the scene. Two minors were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Police arrested Richee and Mooring Thursday following days of reviewing surveillance footage and interviewing witnesses, according to the department. 

Anyone with information in the case may call Investigator Alfaro with the Riverside County Sheriff's Office Central Homicide Unit at 951-955-2777.

Gonzalez signed with Mayweather's TMT promotion in 2016 when he was just 18, signifying his status as one of the sport's rising stars.

'There are certain times when you know you've just struck gold and this is one of them,' Mayweather wrote on social media after signing Gonzalez in 2016.

The 5-foot-6 featherweight was 3-0 in his brief career before stepping away from the sport in 2018. He hinted at his return to the ring in January, posting video of himself on social media during a sparring session. 

'R.I.P champ gone but never forgotten,' Mayweather posted after Gonzalez's murder.

'We are very sad to report the tragic death of boxer and top prospect, Danny González,' WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on Twitter on September 7. 'We send our deepest condolences and prayers to the Gonzalez family at this hard time. May Danny rest in eternal peace.'
