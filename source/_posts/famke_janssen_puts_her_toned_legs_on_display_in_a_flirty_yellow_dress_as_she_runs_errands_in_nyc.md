Famke Janssen put her ageless beauty on display as she ran errands in New York City on Saturday. 

While flaunting her envy-inducing legs and trim figure, the 55-year-old former Bond girl looked like a ray of sunshine in a flirty yellow dress and a blue galaxy mask. 

She accessorized her trendy ensemble with a pair of oversized black sunglasses and a simple taupe clutch adorned with a fringe zipper.

The beauty opted to style her long dark tresses in loose waves for her outing, while strutting around in her glossy ballerina flats.  

Besides gracing the screen as Xenia in Goldeneye in 1995, Janssen is also known for playing superhero Dr. Jean Grey in the beloved X-Men franchise.

She first portrayed Jean in the 2000 film X-Men and later reprised the role for the 2003 sequel X2.
