Discussing the ordeal, Jake said: 'It was really hard, so hard for Sophie, it's her body. It affected both of us, honestly it was really tough. Luckily, i tried to keep you positive, thinking we'll try again and tried to keep her going and here we are.'

When asked how her current pregnancy was going, Sophie said: 'So far it hasn't been too good, I've felt really sick. But now i'm coming out the other side and hoping the next few months I'll be able to enjoy. We've only got about 5 months left.'

Jake and Sophie announced they are expecting their first child together in last week's edition of Hello! magazine.

The singer and Dancing On Ice winner enthused he's 'so excited' to become a dad after embarking on a relationship with his partner, 27, two years ago.

However Jake admitted on the show had he has received some negativity since the announcement, with one particularly nasty troll tweeting him online. 

Speaking on the reaction, he said: 'I received more support now than i did on X factor. If i had this much then i might have won it! We did have one tweet which was horrible.

'I'm from Scunthorpe and can't help but go back at them if say something. 99 per cent are nice ones but what sticks in mind are the nasty ones.'

The tweet Jake was referring to was from Twitter user who commented on Jake's post saying: 'Hope ur gf loses the baby.'

Jake was having none of it, and came back to the now-deleted tweet: 'Never thought a tweet would make me feel sick, if only you knew how hurtful this is not only to us but so many other people!!!

'Please grow the F*** up quickly.'

Aside from the horrific message, Jake assured that the couple are doing 'great', and 'haven't stopped smiling' since they learned they are going to become parents.

Sophie is already mum to her little boy Freddie and Jake admitted he has now 'got used' to being around her son, and tries to be a 'friend' to him.  

Explaining how they told him he was set to be a big brother, Sophie said: 'We wrote Freddie a card and put love baby, he was like "who's baby? how has a baby written a card?" now really he's good, asks about baby everyday and we tell him to be good as the baby can hear everything he does.' 

The couple also revealed they don't intend on finding out the gender of their baby but they are already discussing name options for both sexes.  

Earlier this week in a joint interview, beauty therapist Sophie gushed about the 'hands-on' musician who already plays the role of a stepfather to her six-year-old son Freddie from a previous relationship.

Father-to-be Jake told Hello! magazine: 'I'm excited for everything, apart from the nappies! It's something I've always wanted to do and I feel completely ready for it.'

The media personality also detailed his relationship with his stepson: 'Freddie is a little legend. He's like my best mate. I met him when he was four, but I don't say that I'm his dad because I'm not and he's already got a really great dad. He's got me used to being around kids and it will be so nice to have my own child, too.'

The couple spoke about their heartbreak after suffering a miscarriage last year when the beautician was six weeks pregnant.

Sophie bravely shared: 'Even though I was only six weeks pregnant it really hit me hard. With this pregnancy we still carry that worry, so it was nice to have the scan and know that everything is okay.' 

The pair had been left 'disappointed' as they tried to grow their family for a year and a half, but doting boyfriend Jake reassured the beautician by insisting they should 'stop putting pressure on themselves' and declared 'it will happen when it's meant to happen'.  

The X Factor star also revealed he'll be sharing his experience as a first-time dad with his close pals, who are also becoming parents.     

Jake also announced the exciting news on Instagram on Sunday as he penned a sweet caption about following in his late father's footsteps, who passed away from bone cancer in 2008.

The former semi-pro footballer said: 'I AM GOING TO BE A DAD!! I can't believe it , we are going to have a little Jake or little sophie causing mayhem!! 

'My dad was the best dad in the world and I also have an incredible step dad, I wish my dad was about to see how I will be a role model to this baby, Fred's super excited aswell. 2021 is going to be the biggest test yet, but I'm so excited for it! ❤️❤️❤️.' (sic) 

Earlier this year, Jake told Lorraine viewers about life in lockdown with Sophie and Freddie, sharing: 'We're either going to be together, or I'm going to be single by the end of this lockdown, I've been winding her up.

'Little Freddie comes jogging with us, we also play in the garden while Sophie works from home. If we all stick together, we will be stronger in the end.'

Jake was previously engaged to his ex Danielle Fogarty, 28, who he split from in April 2018.

They were said to have been at the centre of much tension following the influx of female attention he has received from his stint on Dancing On Ice. 

The former couple had been dating for three years but called it quits just seven months after he proposed to her.
