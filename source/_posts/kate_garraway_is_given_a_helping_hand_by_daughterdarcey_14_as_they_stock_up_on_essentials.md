Kate Garraway was seen going food shopping with her daughter Darcey on Thursday as they continue to navigate life amid husband Derek Draper's corona battle.

The duo, aged 53 and 14, were laden with essentials which they loaded into the car as they spent time together during Kate's break from Good Morning Britain.

Former Blair lobbyist Derek, 53, who shares Darcey and son Billy, 11, with Kate, has been in hospital since March slowly recovering from his battle with COVID-19 and last month Kate was able to visit him for the first time.

Kate and Darcey cut low-key figures as they stepped out in casual wear to get the shopping, which they loaded into her swanky car.

Kate has been candid about her heartbreaking struggle while her GMB co-stars have been vocal in their ongoing support for her plight. 

Earlier this month, she confirmed that she is taking a week off from Good Morning Britain to help Billy, get ready for secondary school while taking care of Derek as he continues his recovery from the deadly virus. 

Explaining that she would be taking some time off, Kate said: 'I'm actually not here next week, I'm taking a bit of time off to help Billy get sorted for secondary school and Darcey as well get ready for school. And also Derek, look after things on that.'

Showing her appreciation, she added: 'I just want to say thank you to all of you for absolutely being brilliant since I've come back through challenging times. Everyone here, you, Ben, everyone on screen and off screen you've been amazing.' 

'Everyone talks about ITV and TV being a brutal business and it's not, it's a proper family you've all been amazing. Thank you so much.'

Last month, Kate revealed she is writing a self-help book as she continues to support Derek. She admitted that she was given the deal before Derek's illness and is now tweaking the book to include 'insights' from the ordeal. 

She plans to call the book Good Morning Life: How To Wake Up Every Day And Smile.

Kate and her co-host Alex Beresford discussed self-help books after Adele praised Glennon Doyle's Untamed: Stop Pleasing, Start Living for 'changing her life'.

During the chat, she said: 'I am going to declare that just before Derek got sick I started writing a book, I got a publishing deal, based on well-being and all the things I've learned.

'It was going to be called Good Morning Life: How To Wake Up Every Day And Smile, it's still going ahead, I'm still writing it, but I'm going to include obviously different insight that has happened to me along the way.'

She added: 'I find that there are books that are very helpful.'

MARCH  

Kate revealed she and Prince Charles had got 'relatively close' at the Prince's Trust Awards on March 11 - Charles was diagnosed with coronavirus in mid-March.  

She said: 'Around the 29/30 March, I came home came in and said [to Derek] 'god you look ill.'

 'He said he had a headache, numbness in his right hand, and was struggling to breathe,

'I rang Dr Hilary (Jones) and tried to get through, he talked to Derek. He said put me back on, I think you need to call an ambulance'

Derek, 52, was taken into hospital on March 30 and remained in an unresponsive condition.

Kate and her children isolated at home after she displayed 'mild symptoms'.

'I'm afraid he is still in a deeply critical condition, but he is still here, which means there is hope.' 

MAY 

Kate said: 'The journey for me and my family seems to be far from over as every day my heart sinks as I learn new and devastating ways this virus has more battles for Derek to fight. 

'But he is still HERE & so there is still hope.'

That month, Kate and her family took part in the final clap for carers

She said: 'I'll never give up on that because Derek's the love of my life but at the same time I have absolute uncertainty'
