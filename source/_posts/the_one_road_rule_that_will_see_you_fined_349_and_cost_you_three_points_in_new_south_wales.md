Drivers are being warned that resting their elbow on an open car window carries fines of $349 and three demerit points.

Northern Beaches Police Area Command have reminded New South Wales motorists and passengers that placing any body part outside the window or door of a car is illegal.

The only exception is when the driver is giving a hand signal to indicate changing direction to the right, or slowing and stopping.

But motorists have slammed the little-known rule as 'revenue raising' and a 'nanny state law'. 

'What a criminal waste of time! Shame on you for promoting nanny state laws,' one social media user wrote.

'You have such an important and worthwhile job with such limited resources, so focus on what's meaningful.' 

'Surely there are more important things the police could be doing,' said another.

'This can ONLY be about Revenue Raising.' 

One driver added: 'I support our police and seriously hope most I know would channel their energy toward less petty infringements.'  

The same laws apply in Victoria, where $165 on-the-spot fines apply for 'driving or travelling with any part of body protruding'

The same laws apply in Victoria, where $165 on-the-spot fines apply for 'driving or travelling with any part of body protruding'. 

In Queensland, drivers and passengers face penalties of $298, while South Australians face $244 fines and three demerit points if found guilty of the offence.

The laws are slightly more lax in WA, with $50 fines and one demerit point for drivers caught with any body part outside their car.
