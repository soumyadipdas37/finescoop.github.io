Jess Wright has revealed R&B superstar Chris Brown once 'slid into her DMs'. 

The former TOWIE star, 35, admitted she has been approached by numerous celebrities via social media, but said the musician, 31, was the 'best one'.

In a video exclusively obtained by MailOnline, Jess answered Ibiza Weekender's David Potts when he asked which stars have messaged her on Instagram on Wednesday's forthcoming episode of ITV2's Celebrity Karaoke Club.

Jess said: 'As if I'm going to tell you everyone! However, I'm going to give you the best one... Chris Brown.' 

Dave, 25, gasped while Scarlett Moffatt walked off in shock and said: 'Goodbye everyone,' while singing one of the pop star's hit songs.  

Jess explained: 'To be fair, I'm going to bring this right back down. When I say "he slid into my DMs", he responded to a [Instagram] story that I put of his song, [Dear God] A Prayer.' 

Scarlett, 29, responded: 'But still! That's sliding into your DMs, hun.'

Chris previously had an on-and-off romance with fellow superstar, Rihanna, dating back to 2008, before the couple decided to end things for good in 2013 after rekindling their romance. 

He moved on with actress Karrueche Tran but their love affair came to an end in 2015 after she discovered he had fathered a child, Royalty, five, with his former fling, Nia Guzman.

In November 2019, Chris welcomed his second child, Aeko, with his ex-girlfriend Ammika Harris and confirmed the news on social media by sharing a picture of their newborn. 

It is believed the couple are now dating again after the birth of their son reignited their romance.

Jess is currently immersed in wedding preparations for her nuptials to her businessman fiancé, William Lee-Kemp, in June 2021. 

The pair got engaged in the glorious French Alps in March this year, and Jess has already delivered socially distanced formal invites to her 15 bridesmaids for the upcoming wedding. 

The TV star wrote on Instagram: '2020 has been a strange year for us all.

'I got engaged just before this pandemic, & when rules were eased, told my (many) nearest & dearest that I wanted them to be my bridesmaids, from a distance.

'I hope everyone is keeping safe & we get through this soon & a big thank you to all our NHS & key workers for supporting us.'

Celebrity Karaoke Club airs on Wednesdays and follows stars such as Courtney Act and Melvin Odoom as they go head-to-head in a singing competition. 

During last week's first episode, Scarlett appeared to be having a blast as she belted out the lyrics to Summer Lovin' from the classic film, Grease, alongside Courtney, 38.  

The former I'm A Celebrity star looked chic in a blue and white print minidress but decided to go barefoot during their performance. 

As Courtney hit the high notes as Sandy, Scarlett immersed herself in Danny's Lothario persona by doing a series of crude dance moves.   

While the duo performed the smash hit, Jess, Dave, and Tallia Storm grooved along in the audience. 

At the end of every episode, a singer is sent home, with new celebrities joining the competition every week.

Despite being a professional singer, Tallia, 21, was the first celebrity to be evicted on the first episode which aired last Wednesday. 

Joining them on the quest to find the Celebrity Karaoke Club king or queen will be TV presenter Roman Kemp, singer Diana Vickers, Drag Race's Baga Chipz and Love Island's Samira Mighty. 

Celebrity Karaoke Club continues at 10pm on ITV2
