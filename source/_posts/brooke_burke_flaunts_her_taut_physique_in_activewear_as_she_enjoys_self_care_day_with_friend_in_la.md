Brooke Burke has been helping her 433K Instagram followers in prioritizing health and fitness during quarantine.

And the TV personality is also giving a glimpse at some of the treatments in her own wellness routine.

She flaunted her taut physique Monday in black and white activewear, as she stepped out for a self care day at a spa with a friend in West Hollywood.

Burke carried a blue Hydrate XL water bottle in her hand, with a cognac leather crossbody bag.  

She later updated her followers, posting a video to her Instagram Story from Next Health in West Hollywood for her 'self care day.'

Next was a cryotherapy tank, in which she showed her reflection in the window, now sporting a towel. 

She showed a timer, saying: 'This is our goal, three minutes and 30 seconds. Woah... Alright, cryotherapy.' 

'We're just gonna go in there and freeze?' she asked an employee, who responded, 'yea,' to which she laughed.

She told E! News earlier this month about the importance of self care: 'Make time for yourself! You're worth it! Too many women find comfort in falling last on the totem pole. Now that I'm in my 40s, I understand the value of me time and taking care of myself with zero guilt. 

'The more I take care of myself, the better I feel and the better I am in all areas of my life. I'm also raising four children, so I try leading by example regarding the value of self-care.'
