Jack Fincham has revealed that he has headed back to the clinic to have a treatment on his hairline following a transplant to cover up a scar after developing a bald spot. 

The Love Island star, 29, returned to the KSL Clinic in Maidstone, Kent, to have a platelet-rich plasma treatment on Sunday four months after undergoing scar repair surgery. 

Jack had a sample of blood taken out of his forearm before hair transplant surgeon Dr Matee made injections along the top of his scalp to boost his hair growth.

Speaking on the KSL Instagram page, he said: 'I had my hair transplant about four months ago but I come back regular for PRPs to boost the growing.' 

Combing his fingers through his brunette locks, Jack appeared overjoyed with his noticeably thicker hairline and even joked he could have hair down to his chest. 

Turning to Dr Matee, he added: 'Hang on a minute I have an afro. It works - I can't believe it!'

Jack underwent a hair transplant and has had regular PRP treatment, which injects the patient's own platelets into the scalp, to keep his hairline strong and healthy.  

Speaking about his hair journey in June, he said: 'I ended up killing two birds with one stone and getting a hair transplant on the scar and hairline it don’t even hurt man! Can’t recommend @ksl_clinics enough they’re unreal at what they do!'

Expanding on the process, he continued: 'I can’t believe how straight forward it is, literally they just drill in at the back, take the hair out and put it in a pot! I didn’t think it was that simple, but it really is!'

Speaking of how he tackled the process, he admitted: 'I was well nervous before I had it. But once I laid down with Netflix on, a couple of toilet breaks, I was sweet.'

The clinic, which has branches across the country, gave Jack platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment over the past year, before he joined a host of fellow celebrities in boosting his hairline.

He said: 'I’ve been amazed by the results at KSL Clinic especially Jake Quickenden, Mike Hassini, Kieran Nicholls and my friend Joe Swash.'

'They all spoke really highly of their experience here at KSL Clinic and with their hair transplant surgeon Dr Matee.'     

Of their initial decision to inform him that he didn't need a hair transplant, Jack noted: 'I appreciate the honesty of KSL Clinic and the advice given to me by their hair surgeon Dr Matee.

'I was informed that I didn’t actually need a hair transplant when I first visited the clinic one year ago - not many places would be as truthful.'

His hairline is just one of a few major changes in Jack's life over the past several months, as he welcomed his first child into the world back in January.
