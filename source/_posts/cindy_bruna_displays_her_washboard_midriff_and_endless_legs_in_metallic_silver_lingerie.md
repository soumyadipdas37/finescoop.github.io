She is one of the most in-demand models in the world today.

And Cindy Bruna looked sensational as she made a shimmering appearance at the Etam Womenswear Spring/Summer 2021 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday.

The Vogue coverstar, 26, exhibited her washboard abs and endless legs in metallic silver lingerie as she strutted down the catwalk.

A halterneck top drew the eye to the star's slender waist while pearlescent pink underwear highlighted her toned legs.

She boosted her statuesque frame with shimmering silver heels teamed with socks.

Her raven tresses were styled in a sleek updo while statement chandelier earrings added extra drama to the look.

Cindy began modelling early on after being discovered at 16 years old and signing with Metropolitan Management and Wilhemina Models. 

In 2012 she walked exclusively for Calvin Klein and has previously appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia, as well as editorials across a number of different Vogue publications, Harper's Bazaar and ELLE UK.

She first made her Victoria's Secret fashion show debut in 2013 and appeared in every showcase until its cancellation in 2019.

The lingerie giant's parent company, L Brands, confirmed the cancellation in November last year, amid dwindling ratings and ongoing backlash over its lack of diversity.

 'Unfortunately the Victoria's Secret show won't be happening this year,' Shanina Shaik confirmed to Australia's Daily Telegraph in July 2019. 

'It's something I'm not used to because every year around this time I'm training like an Angel.'

In an interview with Vogue last year, Cindy spoke about being scouted at 16 and how her parents coped.

She said: 'My mom wanted me to finish school first. You hear so many things about modelling that parents don't really want for their kids.'

Fashion icon Azzedine Alaïa treated her as a protégé, as she said: 'Alaïa was my first job. I arrived at his showroom and was not even able to walk in heels. I learned to walk with him..

'Through it all, I could always feel that I was in the presence of a genius. He offered me a dress for my birthday.'
