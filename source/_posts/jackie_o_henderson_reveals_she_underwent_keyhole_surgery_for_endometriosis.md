She has made no secret of her struggles with endometriosis, a painful condition that affects a woman's reproductive organs.

And on Tuesday, radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed that she previously underwent keyhole surgery for the condition.

Speaking to fellow endometriosis suffer Angie Kent on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday, the 42-year-old explained that the surgery made a 'big difference' to her quality of life.

Talking about her own experience with the condition, Angie said: 'I just had keyhole surgery for endometriosis... This is my second one I have had.'

Jackie responded by saying that she had also undergone the same procedure in the past, but didn't specify when.

'I had the keyhole surgery as well and it made a big difference, it really did,' she said.

Jackie spoke openly about her endometriosis battle on The Thinkergirls podcast back in 2017.

She revealed the 'pain would come like clockwork' during her periods, but she wasn't diagnosed until the age of 32. 

'[The pain] came out of nowhere. One morning I woke up, I was dying. I'd never had any period pain in the lead up to that,' she said.

'It made a big difference': Jackie O went on to reveal that she had also undergone the same procedure in the past. Pictured with radio co-host Kyle Sandilands 

'No one had ever mentioned the word endometriosis to me until I was 32,' she added.

'It came like clockwork and it got worse and I tried every sort of thing you could imagine. It was getting to the point where I had to go to the hospital every month and get morphine.'

Endometriosis is a painful condition that affects a woman's reproductive organs, and occurs when the tissue that usually lines the uterus grows outside of the uterus.
