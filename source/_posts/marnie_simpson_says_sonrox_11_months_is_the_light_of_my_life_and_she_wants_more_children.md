Marnie added that although she wants more children in the future, she's in no rush, she joked: 'I think one is enough... I definitely want more but I'm not in a hurry.'

The reality star also admitted that it was hard trying to film during lockdown with Rox at the same time but thankfully she was able to get help from her family.

Marnie said: 'It was really hard filming with Rox, not going to lie, but I did have a lot of help from family and also the next series we will definitely be getting childcare for him.

'It was really difficult to do but obviously Rox is turning one next month. I've always said that I didn't want to put him in childcare until her was one-years-old, next month he is one, so the next series it will be a lot easier as we'll have childcare!'
