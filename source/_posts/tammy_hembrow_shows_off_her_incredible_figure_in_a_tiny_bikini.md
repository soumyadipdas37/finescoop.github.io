She recently debuted her new relationship with athlete Matt Poole.

And love is certainly agreeing with Tammy Hembrow.

The Instagram sensation showed off her incredible figure and glowing bronzed complexion as the pair continued their romantic getaway in The Whitsundays this week. 

Love looks good on her! Tammy Hembrow shows off her curves in a strapless bikini during a romantic holiday in the Whitsundays with her new beau Matt Poole 

The mother-of-two posted several snaps from her trip to the idyllic island on her Instagram account. 

In the pictures, Tammy posed in strapless floral bikini that showcased her curves and tattoos. 

She also posted a fun video of her and Matt enjoying a fun water slide off their boat.   

On Saturday, Tammy and her hunky new man appeared to be making things official as they shared their first selfie together on Instagram.

Happy: Tammy just recently debuted her new relationship with the athlete

Having a ball! The pair went on a week long trip with a few friends

Uploading a photo to his Instagram account, Matt was seen planting a kiss on Tammy's cheek while they enjoyed a boat cruise.

'Hey lover,' Tammy quickly commented underneath the post.

The photo appeared to be taken on Thursday, when Tammy and the Ironman chartered a luxury yacht with friends. 



Tammy's trip to the Whitsundays comes after she and Matt were spotted packing on the PDA at Brisbane Airport this week.

Her ex-fiancé Reece Hawkins's recent baby announcement with London Goheen seemed like the last thing on Tammy's mind as she cosied up to her statuesque new lover.

Matt was previously in a relationship with Maddy King - the model ex of Kris Smith.

Water world!  The group were treated to a blow up waterslide on the side of their boat
