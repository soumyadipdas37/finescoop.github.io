She moved fans in June after disclosing her mental health struggles in an emotional anti-racism speech in the wake of George Floyd's death. 

And Clara Amfo has reflected on the powerful moment in the October issue of Cosmopolitan.

The BBC Radio 1 presenter, 36, also admitted that she is 'very aware' of the new attention on her but insisted that she is still 'quite a low-key person'. 

Stunning! Clara Amfo has reflected on her powerful anti-racism speech in the October issue of Cosmopolitan

In June, the broadcaster broke down in tears on her radio show as she discussed her mental health struggles following the death of George Floyd.  

Clara delivered a powerful speech on racism as she told listeners she was unable to come into work the day before and speak with 'happy intention' when she had spent the weekend devastated.

Discussing her powerful speech with Cosmopolitan, she said: 'It was a culmination of all those weeks. [The death of] Ahmaud Arbery, then Breonna Taylor, and then, obviously, George Floyd, the list goes on. 

'And years before that, Philando Castile, Sandra Bland... You just carry it. You carry it with you and it just comes to that point where I was like, "You know what? I've just got to come with the realness." That's why I said what I said.'

Keeping it real! The BBC Radio 1 presenter, 36, also admitted that she is 'very aware' of the new attention on her but insisted that she is still 'quite a low-key person'

She added: 'I knew I wanted to speak about [George Floyd] because, at that point, I'd just had enough of not sharing that side of who I am.'

Clara also thanked her listeners, she continued: 'If I was going through anything else – God forbid, if I had an illness or if I was going through a painful break- up – honestly, I'd tell my listeners because they're cool like that.' 

The star admitted that although she is grateful for people's support she doesn't want her professional legacy to be 'that girl who cried on the radio'.

She said: 'That day definitely made me feel my purpose in my job, more than anything I've done, but I don't want my professional legacy to be "That girl who cried on the radio".'

Clara added: 'I'm so much more than that; we're all so much more than these moments.

'It's not that I'm not grateful for what people are saying, but I think, for my own brain space, I know what I said in that moment and now those words are out there, they've travelled to people. 

'Now I want the truth of those words, for the people who felt affected by them, to pay it forward, to do the work.'

Talking about the work and steps that need to happen next, Clara admitted that she has been reflecting on her own privileges.

She said: 'I've had to reflect on myself and my own privileges. Because within Black Lives Matter, there's Black Trans Lives Matter. I've had to look at myself as a straight person. 

'I've had to look at [myself] in the very same way that I've been asking white people to look at themselves. It's important for all of us to take accountability for how we move through the world.'

Talking about the new attention she has received recently, Clara insisted that she is still 'quite a low-key person'.  

She said: 'I feel like I'm in this new phase of my career where I'm very aware of the new attention that's on me. But I'm still quite a low-key person. I don't view myself as acting particularly like a celebrity. 

'I understand it's a public- facing job – I appear on television and I do radio – so people are going to recognise me. But I don't live a particularly starry existence.'

And it looks as though Clara could be getting even more attention as she is rumoured to be a contestant on the new series of Strictly. 

Discussing the speculation, she teased: 'Look, Strictly is an amazing show. 

'It's so sweet-spirited; nobody ever watches it with a bad intention and that's what I've always loved about it… I went to watch it [live] last season! The magic of it is so overwhelming.'

Talking about her future, she said: 'I know that this is exactly where I'm supposed to be. My work, where I am now, I feel ready for it. I'm aware of who I want to fight for and what I want to lend my voice to. I feel supercharged, I feel ready.'

Meanwhile, in her personal life, Clara teased that she is 'entertaining conversations' of dating. 

Tease! Discussing the Strictly speculation, she teased: 'Look, Strictly is an amazing show. 'It's so sweet-spirited; nobody ever watches it with a bad intention and that's what I've always loved about it…' (the 2019 contestants pictured) 

She said: 'I'm really open about dating because I know so many women in a similar position to me where they're really coming to know what they're worth. Some of the sh*t that I put up with in my late teens and early twenties, it wouldn't ever fly now!'

Clara looked sensational for the October issue of Cosmopolitan and on the cover she wore a stylish orange patterned shorts and blazer combo.

While a different look saw the broadcaster in a fabulous multicoloured chequered trouser suit.  

The October issue of Cosmopolitan is on sale from 3rd September. 

Single and ready to mingle! Meanwhile, in her personal life, Clara teased that she is 'entertaining conversations' of dating
