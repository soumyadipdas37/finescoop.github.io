'Can’t wait to share my children’s book with you all, Natalie Portman’s Fables — retellings of The Tortoise and the Hare, The Three Little Pigs, and Country Mouse and City Mouse,' she began. 

'I love these classic stories and wanted to update them to be more reflective of the world in which we live,' she added.

'It’s been so fun reading the book to my kids and I look forward to hearing your experiences with your own kids! Link in bio to preorder, in stores 10/20,' she concluded.

The pre-order link from MacMillan also includes a letter from Portman herself, who reveals that she was introduced to the 'feminist baby book' after giving birth to her three-year-old daughter Amalia.

'Every gift we received seemed to be a book about fierce girls, women who changed history and, yes, literal feminist babies,' Portman said.

She added that she wasn't given these kinds of books when her son Aleph was born, and she realized that all of the characters were males.

'In response, I started changing the pronouns in my daughter's classic books. I decided, for my own first children's book, to use classic fables, because I didn't want to feel like we had to throw out the history of child-raising,' she added.

Portman also added she wanted to make her stories, 'reflective of the actual world, where about half the animal kingdom is male and half is female, and some are neither or both.'

She added that these classic tales, 'have great messages' about how 'hard work pays off' but these new versions are 'gender-safe,' adding that they aren't saying that boys' 'inner lives' are more valuable than girls.
