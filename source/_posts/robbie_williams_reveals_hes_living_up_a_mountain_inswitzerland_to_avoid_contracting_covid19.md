Robbie Williams has revealed he's living in Switzerland amid the coronavirus pandemic.

During an interview with Steve Wright on Wednesday's BBC Radio 2, the musician, 46, insisted he's opted to temporarily reside 'up a mountain' in a bid to avoid contracting COVID-19 as he's 'a bit neurotic'.

The singer, who shares Teddy, seven, and Coco, 23 months, and sons Charlton, five, and Beau, six months, with wife Ayda Field, also discussed the impact of the crisis on the performing arts industry and declared he 'can't wait to get back to work'.

When asked he's living in his Los Angeles or Malibu home, the media personality said: 'No I’m not. I’m somewhere in Switzerland up a mountain. 

'Well, I’m a bit neurotic and I thought where can I place myself where it won’t get me? And I thought, well I’ll just live up the Mont Blanc for 6 months… it’s really warm actually, it’s really lovely.'

On how the global outbreak has affected his lifestyle, the former Take That star admitted while he loves spending time with his children, he's eager to get back to 'doing what I love'.

The belter said: 'The performing arts is suffering greatly because of it and, on a personal note from me, I’m so grateful to do what I do for a living and can’t wait to get back to work and start performing again. 

'I’m loving my time with my family, I’m loving my time with my wife, I’ve got 4 kids – it’s joyous – but I’m chomping at the bit now to leave the house and do what I do for a living and what I love.'

The former X Factor judge also confessed his thoughts on having a family changed once he and the model, 41, welcomed their first child.

Robbie said: 'I thought, like, that some strangers turn up and ruin the party, that’s what having kids was like.

'I couldn’t imagine that the universe just presents itself to you and goes "No, here’s a life changing gift that you will love and adore for all of time" so, yeah, so we had 4 of them.'  

On whether his mini-mes will be following in his footsteps, he added: 'Teddy came out of the womb with jazz hands which was incredibly painful for my wife but I would like Charlie to manage me and Teddy to come and join.

'I said to Teddy the other day, ''Baby, when you’re older do you want to come singing with daddy?'' and she went ''No daddy, you’ll be singing with me!''' 

Robbie and Ayda, who exchanged rings during their lavish wedding ceremony in 2010, have had to put their plans for a vow renewal ceremony to celebrate the milestone on hold because of the pandemic.
