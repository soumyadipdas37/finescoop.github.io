Mesut Ozil has named his dream XI of players he's lined up with throughout his career – but only one former Arsenal team-mate makes the cut in his star-studded team.

The playmaker has enjoyed a trophy-laden career, having won the Spanish league title with Real Madrid in the 2011-12 campaign before going on to win the World Cup with Germany in 2014.

Ozil has also helped Arsenal lift three FA Cups in his seven years at the Emirates. He did not receive a medal last season for the club's 14th FA Cup triumph last season however, having only featured in the third-round tie against Leeds in the competition.

Over the past decade or so, the 31-year-old has played alongside some of the best players to grace the pitch which has reflected in the team he has chosen.

In a Q&A on his Twitter page, Ozil was asked to name his dream XI which he heavily populated it with his former Real team-mates.

While he refused to choose himself, the German picked Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Angel Di Maria to lead the attack.

Santi Cazorla was the only Arsenal representative in his dream XI, with saw the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexis Sanchez fail to make the cut.

Sitting in midfield alongside Cazorla is Xabi Alonso, who would both protect a back-four of Phillip Lahm, Sergio Ramos, Jerome Boateng and Marcelo.

In goal is Real's legendary goalkeeper Iker Casillas to complete the dream XI.

Ozil did not play for the Gunners after the Premier League restart in June after a combination of a back injury and being frozen out by boss Mikel Arteta saw him miss the remaining 13 games.

The German - whose last competitive game came in Arsenal's 1-0 win against West Ham in March - has entered the final year of his contract at Emirates Stadium, with the north London side keen to shift his £350,000-a-week salary off the wage bill.

However, Ozil has reportedly insisted he will see out the remainder of his deal in another question before confirming that he is ready to feature for the Gunners in their opening game at Fulham on Saturday if called upon.

'I'm fit & ready and doing my best,' Ozil wrote when asked a question if he was fit and ready for selection for the Premier League opener at Craven Cottage.

'Unfortunately it's not in my hands to decide about the squad on the weekend. We will see!'
