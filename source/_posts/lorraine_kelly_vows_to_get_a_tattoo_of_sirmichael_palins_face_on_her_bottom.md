Lorraine Kelly has vowed to get a tattoo of Sir Michael Palin's face on her bottom so he can have 'one-upmanship' on David Attenborough.

The Monty Python actor and travel documentary maker, 77, appeared on Wednesday's episode of Lorraine where he spoke about David, 94.

Michael revealed that the legendary broadcaster was once shown a tattoo of his face on a girl's thigh while filming with Lorraine vowing to get an inking on her bottom. 

Cheeky! Lorraine Kelly has vowed to get a tattoo of Sir Michael Palin's face on her bottom so he can have 'one-upmanship' on David Attenborough

He revealed: 'Slightly bashfully he [Sir David Attenborough] told me the story of these two girls who had come round the corner where he was filming and said, "Oh gosh it's David Attenborough". 

'And one of them, you know, revealed that on the top of her thigh was David Attenborough's likeness tattooed! He told this story and he really cracked up. 

'The main thing about David is that he has a terrific sense of humour. You can really make him laugh.'

To which Lorraine joked and vowed to get a tattoo of Michael's face on her bottom so he can have 'one-upmanship' on David.

Goodness! Michael revealed that the legendary broadcaster (pictured) was once shown a tattoo of his face on a girl's thigh while filming with Lorraine vowing to get an inking on her bottom  

She quipped: 'Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get a tattoo of your image on my bottom, and then you can say one-upmanship, the next time you see David Attenborough. "Actually, I can go one better!"' 

To which Michael replied: 'Well you've really started something there Lorraine. You may well regret this. I will want to check the tattoo and I shall want to see if it's a decent likeness!'

Michael also discussed David's messages on the environment, he added: 'We are part of nature… we have to be aware of our part in the world and not arrogantly believe that humans can solve everything because we really can't. 

'I think he's really very worried. In his 90s to be giving so much to inform the word, shows how much he cares. And how much he feels it's the last chance saloon.'

Funny: He revealed: 'Slightly bashfully he [Sir David Attenborough] told me the story of these two girls who had come round the corner where he was filming and said, "Oh gosh it's David Attenborough"' and revealed a tattoo on the top of her thigh 

Elsewhere during the chat, Michael spoke about his recent experiences during lockdown and said he has had a 'year confined to home' after a hear operation in 2019.  

He said: 'I've had a lot of thinking time. Because I had a heart operation about a year ago. After six months, I felt absolutely fine… and I feel terrific and then Covid started. 

'So, I've had about a year in all of sort of being confined to home and seeing fewer people and not being able to contact people in quite the same way, or feeling the same human contact. 

'And it does make you think, it makes you think a lot the about how best to spend your life and what we all do to our planet...it for a while gave me a still quiet moment.'

'One-upmanship!': To which Lorraine joked and vowed to get a tattoo of Michael's face on her bottom so he can have 'one-upmanship' on David

Talking about his travel documentaries and series, he added: 'It's difficult now, we can't travel in the same way. 

'I feel sorry for a lot of the younger people who have a great curiosity about the world… suddenly they can't go anywhere. 

'What worries me also is that without that contact between people all over the world, we lose a little bit… we are going to have to get that back.'

Michael added that he would love to visit Dal Lake in Kashmir again and admitted that at the start of his travel series he 'wasn't quite sure' what he was supposed to do.

Lockdown: Elsewhere during the chat, Michael spoke about his recent experiences during lockdown and said he has had a 'year confined to home' after a hear operation in 2019

He said: 'When we started I really wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to be doing. Was I a proper presenter like Alan Whicker? Was I a comic figure acting like Phileas Fogg? And pretty soon I actually stumbled on the fact that it just had to be me. 

'I had to be everyman travelling and if things went wrong, which they invariably did, we kept it  on camera. I think that's what made it appealing.'

Just last week, David joined Instagram at the age of 94, launching his account with a stark warning that 'the world is in trouble'.

The natural historian attracted more than half a million followers within two hours of joining the social media platform. He now, at date, has 4.8 million followers. 

He said he was seeking new ways of reaching out to people as part of his lifelong campaign to halt climate change.

It came ahead of the release of his new film David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet, which launches on Netflix in October.

Lorraine continues on weekdays at 9am on ITV.
