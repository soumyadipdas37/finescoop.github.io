She never fails to turn heads on an outing. 

And Arabella Chi commanded attention in an eye-catching mint-coloured mini dress as she exited a club in Mayfair on Tuesday evening. 

The Love Island star, 29, showcased her bronzed pins as she posed up a storm outside the exclusive London venue.

She rocked the glistening number which featured exaggerated puff sleeves and a v-neckline. 

Arabella paired the unusual look with fashionable trainers in a neutral hue. 

The model flexed her designer accessories which consisted of a Louis Vuitton rucksack, a Prada shoulder bag and a Hermès shopping bag.

She styled her sun-kissed tresses in a straight hairdo and opted for a natural makeup look. 

Arabella appears to be a picture of happiness after it was revealed earlier this month that her new man is 'playboy' Morad Izemrane. 

The Love Islander and her new beau, 35, were spotted packing on the PDA in Ibiza toward the end of August, just weeks after she went public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.

As well as unveiling Morad's identity, The Sun reported that he was arrested for stealing a pricey Rolex from a woman he had a tryst with in a toilet.

According to the publication, he was arrested on accusations of 'affectionate theft' against the Italian woman when attempting to fly from Ibiza to Palma the next day. 

Morad previously dated Dutch model Estelle Cruyff, 41, who is the ex-wife of former Chelsea ace Ruud Gullit and niece of late soccer legend Johann Cruyff.

According to The Sun, the way Arabella and Morad met is just as astonishing, as a source revealed: 'She was seeing a rich guy called Mark and they were out at a party when his friend Mojo turned up with a bottle of champagne.

'Later that evening she took off with Mojo in his Ferrari, leaving her boyfriend Mark behind. That's how they met. It was pretty shocking. They've been together ever since. Arabella likes a good time and hasn't looked back.'  

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Arabella Chi for comment.
