Tottenham are ready to loan out young goalkeeper Alfie Whiteman.

A number of League One and League Two clubs have shown interest in the 21-year-old and Spurs are keen for him to go out and gain more competitive game time.

Whiteman has been at the club since 2015 and is under contract until 2022. A former England Under 19 international, Whiteman was born and bred in Tottenham, is a lifelong Spurs fan and figured on the bench last season.

He trains regularly with the first team but with the arrival of Joe Hart only adding to the competition, Whiteman is ready to step out and gain experience elsewhere.

Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Alfie WhitemanÂ  is available to go out on loan 

Many lower league clubs are interested in a short term deal for the 21-year-old

Tottenham also have Brandon Austin available for loan. He had a spell at Viborg in Denmark earlier this season while they have also fielded enquiries for Paulo Gazzaniga.

Jose Mourinho is happy with his goalkeeping options but still wants to strengthen his attack and defence.

They hold an interest in Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon, who has been talking to Manchester United, but any proposed deal for Crystal Palace striker Alexander Sorloth looks unlikely.
