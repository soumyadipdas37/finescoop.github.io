She's been keeping busy during the 77th Venice Film Festival as she promotes her latest film The World To Come. 

And Vanessa Kirby enjoyed a brief break from her busy schedule as she embarked on a stroll across the Italian city on Tuesday afternoon.

The Crown star, 32, nailed off-duty glamour as she teamed her protective face mask with a chic all-black outfit.

Vanessa's new movie The World To Come is set on the American East Coast in the mid-19th century, where two neighbouring couples battle hardship and isolation, and is based upon Jim Shepard's novel of the same name.

The blonde is known to many for her role as young Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, which she played for the show's first two seasons.

In 2018, the thespian appeared in Mission Impossible: Fallout, and is expected to reprise her role in the upcoming seventh film, which recently resumed filming after being delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Earlier this year, Vanessa spoke exclusively to The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye about preparing for her upcoming role in Pieces Of A Woman.

The actress plays Martha, a Boston woman who loses her baby during a traumatic home birth, and explained that she spent time with a midwife and a paediatrician at the Whittington Hospital in North London in preparation. 

She said: 'I couldn't have acted that, because I've never given birth myself,' she told me. 

'Just by pure chance an amazing woman allowed me to watch her give birth. I didn't know her but she was so generous and allowed me to be there when her boy was born.'
