Daisy, daughter of Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale and textiles designer Pearl Lowe, is currently dating home consultant Jordan Saul, just a month after she was linked to musician Christian Langdon.

Christian is the ex-husband of Cat Pierce from The Pierces. The rocker was a member of Arckid in the 1990s and early 2000s. 

The brunette's spokesperson previously told MailOnline that her relationship with Christian was platonic after she was spotted with a ring on her engagement finger.

Before that, the former Strictly star had been dating singer Jack Peñate, 35, for six months, but they split in March, with Daisy saying she 'couldn't see a future' with him

The beauty had found romance with Jack after splitting from Cameron McMeikan, 24.

Daisy and Cameron dated for almost a year before reportedly ending their romance over their six-year age gap.
