Tiffany Watson was snapped last month on a loved-up, sun-drenched jaunt in the South Of France with a mystery blond hunk.

And it now transpires the hunk in question is 25-year-old footballer Cameron McGeehan.

The pair were spotted out and about on Tuesday, shopping in London.

Tiffany, 26, held hands with the midfielder as they strolled along brandishing shopping bags.

They put on an equally sporty display - Tiff in a black top and grey skinny gym shorts, a black leather jacket, shoulder purse and trainers added to the look.

Cameron - who plays for Dutch side Oostende and used to play on the youth side for Chelsea FC - wore a black and orange Tee.

He added shorts and trainers to the look as he walked alongside Tiffany.

Tiff has been away in the countryside filming the new series of Made In Chelsea - set to return to screens next month.

It's not known whether Cameron will appear alongside her on the show - although show bosses are reportedly keen that he does.

The pair - who had just been to the gym together in West London - looked very loved up when they were on their French getaway together in August.

They were pictured packing on the PDA as they hit the beach while staying at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the South Of France.

Tiffany was on a tour around Europe, having already travelled to Italy with her friend and Amsterdam with her sister, Lucy Watson, 29.  

Tiffany returned to MIC earlier this year as a single girl following her split from her boyfriend, whose identity she kept largely secret on social media. She had a brief fling with Miles Nazaire.  

Discussing her return, Tiffany told OK! Magazine: 'I had a solid two years away from filming the show which actually has gone really quickly.  

'But I have always kept in contact with the producers of the show, chatted to them every couple of months.

'And then I was in a serious relationship. And he was a private person. And when you're on Made In Chelsea it's not really fair unless you share your whole life. With that relationship I wasn't able to share that huge part of my life.'

Upon her reunion with the cast, she ruffled feathers with Zara McDermott - her ex Sam Thompson's girlfriend. 

During the show's finale, Love Island star Zara, 23, expressed her frustration as she thought Tiff overstepped the mark by inviting Sam, 28, out for a drink with her dad Clive.

The former couple dated on and off for two and a half years before splitting for good in 2017. Tiff went on to have another long-term relationship but things ended at the start of this year.

CBB star Sam confessed he had shared a taxi with 'the love of his life' and told her she was 'the best thing to ever happen' to him, leaving an emotional Zara in floods of tears.
