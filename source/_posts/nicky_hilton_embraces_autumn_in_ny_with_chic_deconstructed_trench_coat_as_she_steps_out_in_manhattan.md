Nicky Hilton recently emerged from quarantine to take in some style at New York Fashion Week.

And the Big Apple-born socialite is continuing to serve looks, as she gets back to her daily routine.

She embraced autumn in the city Tuesday, as she stepped out in a chic deconstructed trench coat for a walk in Manhattan, while reminding her 1.2million Instagram followers to register to vote.

The 36-year-old sported a classic khaki trench coat with green plaid lining, which was exposed at the shoulders and lapels.

She layered the coat over a blue and white nautical striped sweater with skinny jeans and a pair of cognac leather flats.

Nicky finished the ensemble with a pair of silver-framed aviators, a black face mask and a beige handbag, trimmed in matching cognac leather.

She also took to her Instagram with a photo of herself wearing a 'VOTE' bracelet for National Voter Registration Day, writing: 'Your daily reminder to register to #VOTE!'

The blonde beauty recently opened up to E! News about the first time she watched her sister's new documentary, which premiered last week on YouTube.

She recounted: 'It was very, very emotional. We watched it for the first time. She didn't even want to show my mother the movie. So we snuck downstairs and we were watching it together. 

'She said, "I don't want mom to see it." I was like, "Well she's going to see it in a few weeks when it's on YouTube for the whole world to see."'

Tearjerker: She recounted: 'We watched it together. We laughed. We cried. I'm just so proud of her, because going through so much trauma and reliving it with the whole world watching is very brave'

Nicky continued: 'We watched it together. We laughed. We cried. I'm just so proud of her, because going through so much trauma and reliving it with the whole world watching is very brave.'

Paris, 39, revealed a never-before-seen side of herself in the documentary, stripping away the shallow socialite character she's been pigeonholed into portraying. 

She told Variety of her portrayal in the film: 'I feel that I’ve grown up so much, especially in the past year. Doing this film, I just had so many realizations and realized who I truly am and why I am the way I am.'
