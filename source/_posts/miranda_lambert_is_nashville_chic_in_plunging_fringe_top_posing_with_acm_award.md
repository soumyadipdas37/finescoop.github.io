Miranda Lambert was Nashville chic as she attended the ACM Awards this Wednesday in the capital of country music.

The 36-year-old posed up a storm with her Music Event Of The Year trophy which she won for her 2019 cover of Fooled Around And Fell In Love.

She also took the stage at the iconic Bluebird Cafe during the show to give a minimalist rendition of her ballad Bluebird.

While standing onstage she sang that the 'stripped-down version' of the number reflected 'basically the way we wrote this song.'

Miranda also gave a tip of the hat to how well-chosen the song was for that particular venue, introducing her performance as 'Bluebird at the Bluebird.'

Bluebird is a cut off her 2019 album Wildcard which also includes the duet Way Too Pretty For Prison with Maren Morris. 

The country blonde hit the stage in a gleaming blue top with all the right touches, including country fringe and bluebird embroidery on the shoulders.

Sweeping her hair into an elegant updo, she sharpened her screen siren features with makeup and added some extra dazzle with hoop earrings.

Even her skintight dark jeans featured bluebird embroidery down the outer sides of the legs leaving no mystery as to which number she would perform. 

Fooled Around And Fell In Love is originally a 1970s song by Elvin Bishop but Miranda sang it as an ensemble piece last year with a group of country ladies.

She was joined by Maren, Ashley McBryde, Tenille Townes, Caylee Hammack, Elle King who have all supported her on her Roadside Bars And Pink Guitars Tour.

Meanwhile for her awards show performance of Bluebird she was joined by a backup performer and musicians but full social distance was maintained onstage. 

The awards show extravaganza blends live and pre-taped segments and be held across three Nashville landmarks, facilitating social distancing.

One of the venues was the Bluebird Cafe where Miranda performed and the others were the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. 

During the same show Miranda's ex-husband Blake Shelton sang with his current blonde love Gwen Stefani at a Bluebird Cafe replica they made in Los Angeles.

What a lineup: She was joined by Maren, Ashley McBryde, Tenille Townes, Caylee Hammack, Elle King who have all supported her on her Roadside Bars And Pink Guitars Tour

Blake and Gwen became a sizzling public item near the end of 2015 just a few months after he and Miranda announced and finalized their divorce.

Miranda has already won 27 ACM Awards and is up for two more this year along with the Music Event Of The Year prize she already won.

Wildcard is up for album of the year against new offerings by Maren as well as country music heartthrobs Luke Combs, Thomas Rhett and Jon Pardi.

She is also facing off for female artist of the year in a formidable category that includes Maren, Carrie Underwood, Kelsea Ballerini and Kacey Musgraves.
