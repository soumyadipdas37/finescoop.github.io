Manchester United have reignited their long-standing interest in Dayot Upamecano as they attempt to follow up the imminent capture of Donny van de Beek.

United are ready to try and prise centre back Upamecano away from RB Leipzig. The 21-year-old is viewed as one of the best young defenders in Europe.

He helped Leipzig finish third in the Bundesliga and impressed in the Champions League knockout stages in Portugal as they reached the semi-finals.

Upamecano’s form was recognised last week when he was named in France’s senior squad for the first time. United have tried to sign him before. 

He visited Old Trafford for a tour of the club in 2015 before moving from Valenciennes to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16 for about £2million. He then joined RB Leipzig in 2017 for a fee in the region of £9m.

Sources say United will have to make Leipzig an offer that is too good to refuse to secure Upamecano as he does not have an active release clause for this window in his contract.

Upamecano did have a buyout clause of around £54m in his previous deal. Manchester City were weighing up a summer move but cooled their interest following the season’s restart. 

Upamecano signed a new deal in July which runs until 2023. It includes a release clause of about £38m that cannot be triggered until next summer.
