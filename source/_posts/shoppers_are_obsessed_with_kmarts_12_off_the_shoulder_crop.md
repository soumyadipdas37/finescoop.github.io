Australian shoppers are obsessed with Kmart's new black and rust-coloured off the shoulder crop, which at $12 is one-tenth of the price of designer label versions.

The Active Womens Youth Seam Free One Shoulder Crop Top is stealing hearts across the nation because of its seam-free material and added stretch.

While it is made to be worn during light to moderate exercise, others have fashioned it into a 'going out' look - and have been wearing it with clean cut trousers and denim jeans.

'This top! I can't believe how cheap it is. Kmart strikes again,' one woman commented on the ensemble.

'I feel like I definitely need this top,' said another. A third added: 'Wow, Kmart is getting stylish!'

Fashion brands like Are You Am I and Revolve are selling very similar crop tops for between $96 and $106, making Kmart the budget winner.

Earlier this week the $18 Active Women's Ankle Length Yoga Legging from Kmart received similar high praise on Facebook after one woman said the budget tights are better than her expensive alternatives. 

'I bought these leggings from Kmart and they are amazing,' Sydney mum Andrea wrote. 

'I normally wouldn't buy leggings from Kmart but the material felt really nice! They are better than my overpriced expensive pair.'

Other customers agreed and said the pants are 'true to size' and 'hug' the abdomen area.

'I have the same pair in black and absolutely love them, I wear them every day around house. So comfortable,' one woman said.

'I got a size 12 and they fit well,' another said. 

A third added: 'I'm wearing a pair of Kmart leggings... it just feels like they're lovingly hugging my unhappy abdomen.'  

On the Kmart website the product has received an average of 4.5 stars out of five and happy customers said the material is 'good quality', 'good value' and 'holds everything in'

Customers can choose to purchase black or khaki green leggings, which are available in sizes six to 20. 

The leggings are also made with a 'yoga performance' hip print on the side and an elastic waistband for added comfort.

The fitness tights are made from polyester and elastane and have a crisscross detailing at the bottom, but don't have pockets.
