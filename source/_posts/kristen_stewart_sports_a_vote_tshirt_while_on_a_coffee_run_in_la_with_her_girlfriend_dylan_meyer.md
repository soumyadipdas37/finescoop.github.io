They've been dating for over a year now.

And Kristen Stewart was still just as attached to her girlfriend Dylan Meyer as they stopped to pick up coffee on Tuesday in Los Angeles' Los Feliz neighborhood.

The 30-year-old actress celebrated National Voter Registration Day while out by wearing a white T-shirt reading 'VOTE' over her chest.

Kristen paired the shirt, which revealed a hint of her taut tummy, with a pair of figure-hugging high-waisted jeans.

The actress had bleached-blonde hair swept back messily while her black sunglasses rested on top of her head. 

The Personal Shopper star rounded out her look with a thick silver chain around her neck, and she wore a white mask to guard against the novel coronavirus.

Her girlfriend Dylan had on a similarly casual outfit with a charcoal tank top advertising King Cobra malt liquor and black skinny jeans that were ripped at the knees.

She rounded out her look with black sneakers, and she wore a black mask that contrasted with Kristen's white design.

After the two got their drinks, Dylan carried the coffee and a lighter-colored drink.

Though her and Kristen's relationship has continued to mature, the actress rarely makes an appearance on Dylan's Instagram, but that changed on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, the screenwriter posted a playful selfie that Kristen took on a balcony as she flashed a thumbs-up while wearing her 'Vote' shirt.

'I turned the mic over to Kristen because she had some things to say and doesn’t have her own account. Happy #nationalvoterregistrationday!' Dylan began, before posting Kristen's words.

Do the right thing: Earlier, Kristen posed on Dylan's Instagram to urge her fans to vote in the November election

'“For anyone that might need to let out a little aggression today... it is national register to VOTE day,' the actress wrote.

'"I never do this but for anyone who has not registered to vote please take this opportunity to feel HEARD. And not hopeless. I am voting because I WANT to believe in our country.'

Kristen cited the threats of climate change and systemic racism as her reasons for voting, as well as her support for the freedom of speech and the right to assemble.

'"I believe in gun control,"' she continued. '"I believe that women have a right to make choices about their own bodies. I believe people have the right to live and love and identify however they feel in their hearts without fear. I believe that people care about each other. So try and have a lovely Tuesday and vote for your f**king lives."'

Wedding bells: She and the XOXO screenwriter were first romantically linked last August, and she's since hinted that wedding bells may be in their future

Kristen and Dylan, who recently was the on-set writer for the Set Rogan vehicle An American Pickle, have ben dating since August of 2019, and have only gotten closer since then.

Back in November, the Clouds Of Sils Maria star sounded smitten with her girlfriend when se told Howard Stern of her plans to propose: 'I can’t say right now because she’ll find out. 

'I have a couple plans that are just the coolest things to do that I don’t think… I think it’s pretty undeniable.'

Leading lady: She's also making LGBTQ hearts aflutter with her upcoming role in the star-studded Christmas movie Happiest Season

Though her career has been on hold due to the pandemic, Kristen has a busy year ahead of her.

She'll star opposite Mackenzie Davis in the rom-com Happiest Season, which has already been filmed, as a woman who plans to propose to her girlfriend at her family's holiday festivities, only to learn that her girlfriend isn't out to her conservative parents.

She also shocked some fans when it was announced that she had been cast in Pablo Larraín Princess Diana biopic Spencer as the eponymous royal.
