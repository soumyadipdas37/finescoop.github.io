She isn't afraid of letting men have a piece of her mind.

And Clare Crawley demands respect as the next Bachelorette.

In the new trailer for the upcoming season of the show, viewers were treated to flashbacks of Clare, 39, telling former Bachelor Juan Pablo off.

Respect! Clare Crawley oozes confidence in the empowering new teaser for The Bachelorette

The empowering new teaser is set to the song Respect, and begins with Clare legging her way down the stage in a pair of silver, rose-accented high heels as scenes from her first season on The Bachelor play out.

'Do you think you know me?' she tells Juan sternly.

Then, Clare sits perched upon a giant display of roses as she drops both of her high heels to the floor.

Looking every inch the leading lady, Clare oozes confidence as she works a fitted off-the-shoulder white dress and head full of wavy blonde locks.
