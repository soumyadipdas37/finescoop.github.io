She recently described lockdown as a 'blessing' as she continues to enjoy some downtime with her family.

And Rachel Riley looked radiant as ever as she departed the Countdown studio in MediaCityUK in Salford on Monday.

The TV presenter, 34, cut a stylish figure for the day, donning a navy short-sleeved top with a matching skirt with a pleated detail.

The garment also featured a frilled collar while she cinched her waist with a matching belt.

Rachel sported a pair of beige sandals and carried a multi-coloured handbag as she left the studio.

The Essex native completed her look for the day by letting her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders. 

Rachel, her husband Pasha Kovalev and their daughter Maven, eight months, have been spending lockdown with her Russian mother-in-law Galina, whose month-long visit to the UK was extended amid the pandemic.

The couple, who became first-time parents to Maven in December, have been enjoyed extended time off at home amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Speaking on Heart Breakfast with Jamie Theakston and Lucy Horobin, the blonde recently admitted the countrywide lockdown has been something of a blessing for the family as they have been given 'enforced maternity and paternity leave'.

The Oxford University alum said: 'Well we're quite fortunate in a way, I was supposed to be back at work, Pasha was supposed to be on tour, and it's kind of enforced maternity and paternity leave we didn't have before so we're loving it.

'She's just over five months, I've left her in bed in kind of the same sleeping position as Pash, if you hear crying it could be either one of them I have no idea.'

Rachel's appearance came after she revealed she came to the aid of one of her friends suffering domestic abuse, after learning of her plight during lockdown.

The media personality spoke out as she got candid about the abuse so many more women are experiencing behind closed doors.

She told The Mirror: 'I've been supporting a friend who I didn't know was in a situation of domestic violence for some years. While I can't go into specifics, I know COVID has made things more difficult.

'It's been so hard for women in her situation, without direct access to support services. I saw a poster that said 'Domestic abusers have always worked from home' and that's so true.

'There's no outlet currently. People are trapped at home, the kids aren't at school and police and social services are running a limited service.'
