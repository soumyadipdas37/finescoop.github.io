He's known to withhold judgment when it comes to the contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.

But host Osher Günsberg wasn't holding his tongue on the latest episode of the Cocktails and Roses podcast, which he presents with Bachelor alum Alisha Aitken-Radburn.

The 46-year-old blasted Bella Varelis for her childish behaviour on the show last week when she declared her friendship with Irena Srbinovska was 'over'.

Alisha said that Bella's behaviour at Thursday's cocktail party was like that of a 17-year-old high school student.

But Osher - who is known for keeping a professional distance from the drama in the mansion - disagreed, saying her attitude was even more immature than that.

He said: 'No, no, no. This was straight out of a grade nine, little lunch conflict playbook. "Friendship over" is something that you say right before the bell and you have to then go into P.E.

'Come on, man. We're grown adults. You pay tax, you vote. Come on. No one says "friendship over".'

Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, got into a heated argument during Thursday's episode of The Bachelor.

Their confrontation took place within days of the cast returning to the mansion after several months of COVID-19 lockdown.

The women, who had been close friends earlier in the season, clashed because Irena had supposedly misled Bella about how often she was communicating with Locky Gilbert outside of the 'official' Zoom sessions.

After telling Irena she didn't trust her, marketing consultant Bella stood up and stormed off in the middle of the cocktail party.

'Friendship done. I'm f**king over your bullshit, to be honest! You're a manipulative little bitch!' she yelled.

Nurse Irena confessed she was 'in complete and utter shock' at Bella's reaction, and agreed that their friendship was effectively over.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
