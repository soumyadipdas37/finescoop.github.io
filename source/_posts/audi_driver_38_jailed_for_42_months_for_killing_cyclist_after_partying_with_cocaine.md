An Audi driver who killed a cyclist because he was tired after partying with cocaine and prostitutes has been jailed for 42 months.  

Craig Howick, 38, left Alex Roberts, 47, bleeding by the side of the road after smashing into him in his Audi A4. 

Mr Roberts - who had been cycling home from work - was taken to hospital with multiple injuries following the crash but died six weeks later.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Howick, of Caldicot, Monmouthshire, later staged a collision into a hedge to hide the damage caused to his car.   

But police found part of his windscreen trim at the scene and tracked him down.

He pleaded guilty to causing death by driving carelessly and without attention and perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 42 months. 

Howick initially denied the collision and told police his car had been damaged when he swerved to avoid a badger.

But he finally admitted the crash saying he had been distracted by the car radio when he struck Mr Roberts.

Dad-of-two Howick revealed he had been partying 'with two sex workers' and had taken cocaine on the night before the smash. 

Mr Robert's partner Rachel Cooney told how he woke in hospital and proposed to her before his death in September last year.

She said: 'Eventually Alex came round and the first thing he said to me was we should get married. 

'I was happy and optimistic but he took a turn for the worst and a few days later anguish filled my nights.

'I wasn't given any hope and my life as I knew it was gone. When Alex died, I lost him forever, the man I was going to marry and the man who gave me hope again was now gone.

'I find it hard to take how someone could have done this to Alex and shown contempt for his life by leaving him by the side of the road. It's shocking and repulsive to me.' 

Matthew Roberts, defending, said: 'His behaviour that night was unforgivable and he should have seen him and stayed at the scene. He accepts that.

'He takes full responsibility and doesn't seek to plead his own cause. He can't turn back the clock and accepts he shouldn't have acted in the way he did.'

Judge Niclas Parry told him: 'You were tired after partying with sex workers and taking class A drugs and alcohol.'

He said: 'The life of an intelligent, kind and gentle man was needlessly and wastefully lost.

'Whilst he was cycling home, it was a fine day and on a straight stretch of road, you struck him with your vehicle.

'There is no reason why you should not have seen your victim and the offence is aggravated grievously by your disgraceful and appalling actions.'
