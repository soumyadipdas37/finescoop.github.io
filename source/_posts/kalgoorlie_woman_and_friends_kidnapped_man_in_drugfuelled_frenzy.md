A woman at the centre of the brutal drug-fuelled kidnapping of a former friend tried to silence the victim by offering him a lifetime supply of meth. 

Shalia Merinda Higgins, 29, was angry at the victim when she called on a group of friends to bring him to her home in South Kalgoorlie, Western Australia in April last year. 

The victim had allegedly stolen four bags of meth and trashed her home while she was in custody for unrelated reasons, The West Australian reported. 

Her crew of offenders, including Tristen Taylah O'Dea, 24, and Mikayla Rae Cook - known as 'wildest woman of the west' - forced him to endure hours of torment before taking him to the home.

Cook filmed the violent kidnapping after the victim was ambushed by the group.

The disturbing vision showed the victim, who was choked and beaten, being dragged to the boot of a car owned by O'Dea.

O'Dea was heard shouting abuse at the victim, who was a former best friend. She walked away before two other offenders assaulted the victim. 

Cook was also heard yelling behind the camera.

'I'm sorry bro, you f***ed with my family. You're done,' Cook said after the victim was dragged by his ankles into a backyard. 

The victim had initially attempted to stand his ground by bracing himself with a hatchet. 

But he dropped the object after another attacker charged at him.  

O'Dea and her other accomplices drove around with the victim in the car for some time before he was taken to Higgins.

The victim was able to escape the scene momentarily and call for help before he was confronted by Higgins. 

He was then almost struck down by a brick that was thrown in his direction. 

Higgins was jailed for 16 months following the kidnapping but for unrelated crimes.

While locked up, she called a friend and advised them to offer the victim a lifetime supply of meth if he dropped the charges.

O'Dea and Higgins faced the Kalgoorlie District Court in Western Australia on Thursday over the horrific attack on April 2, 2019. 

Both women pleaded guilty to detaining another person with intent and Higgins also admitted to another charge of attempting to pervert justice.

The court heard how O'Dea has attempted to change her circumstances after finding herself disgusted by her own behaviour. 

The court was told she plans to move away from the toxic environment to Perth. 

Judge Gillian Braddock said the pair's offending was tied to the use of illicit drugs. 

'This comes down to the effect a methamphetamine lifestyle leads to and the complete loss of perspective of normal human judgment of things,' she said.

'In all circumstances it would be of greater interest to foster your rehabilitation than send you straight to jail.'

Judge Braddock considered Higgins 16-month jail sentence to be a penalty, despite the time being served for unrelated offences. 

She slammed Higgins for attempting to get the victim to drop the charges by offering a lifetime supply of meth.

Judge Braddock said it was 'one of the stupidest attempts at perverting justice' she has ever seen. 

The two women were handed a nine-month prison term suspended for two years.

Higgins was also given a 15-month term suspended for two years for attempting to pervert justice.

Co-offenders Cook, Jaydn Page and Tyler Lindsay were sentenced to various terms of immediate prison during an earlier hearing.
