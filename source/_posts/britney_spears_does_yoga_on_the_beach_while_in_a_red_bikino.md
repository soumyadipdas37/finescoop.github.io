Britney Spears posted a cheerful new Instagram album this Wednesday that showed her doing yoga on the beach.

The 38-year-old modeled a red bikini as she lay on her back on the sand, spreading her arms wide and stretching her legs straight up into the air.

'No ..... this isn’t "Just a Touch of Rose" or "RED" ... it is simply ME ... in the most general Britney way !!!' she gushed in the caption.

She has previously used the phrase 'Just a Touch of Rose' to refer to her upcoming 'personal photo project,' which she has since publicly called 'Project Rose.'

In the caption of her latest beach yoga album she wrote: 'Hey … while you’re at it ..... turn the photos upside down and you will find it’s a T !!!!!! For teacher ... tea ... test ... tomorrow ... time ... two ... ten ... tool ... try .... thanks .... they … I mean we could go all day with this one, right !?!?'

Britney concluded her caption by asking: 'Anyhow … who was your favorite teacher in school ..... and what did you LEARN ????'

Meanwhile this Tuesday she recommended the book The Inner Goddess Makeover by Tanishka and shared her hopes that it 'will also strengthen my "Just a Touch of Rose" and "RED" projects as well.'

Her latest album as well as her apparently unrelated 'Project Rose' album comes amid her legal battle over her father Jamie Spears' conservatorship of her.

The pop star's legal circumstances have led to the rise of a 'Free Britney' movement claiming she is kept under strict control by handlers.

Earlier this month Britney took to Instagram to defend herself after fans noted that she repeatedly wore the same kind of peasant-style blouse.

'A lot of people have been saying that a lot of my posts are not new but they're old. But just to let you guys know, none of my pictures or posts are more than a month old,' the mother of two wrote on her page.

My prerogative: Britney recently defended herself for wearing 'the same top 17 times' revealing that 'it's for a project - Project Rose'

'Yes, I know. I did wear the same top 17 times, but it's for a project - Project Rose. And you will be seeing way more of Project Rose in the future,' she wrote.

Amid the Free Britney furor a source last week claimed that Jamie is clashing over the issue with the pop star's mother Lynne.

'Lynne wants a care plan established that would transition Britney's personal life out of the conservatorship,' said an Us Weekly source.

'Jamie has told her that Britney needs long-term monitoring, and he doesn't think she is prepared to take such a drastic action.'

By the way: Since March 25, the Mississippi-born blonde has shared 17 depictions of the fragrant flower as well as countless rose emojis embedded in her captions

Lynne and Jamie, who were married from 1975 until 2002, share three children - daughters Britney and Jamie Lynn, 29, and son Bryan, 43.

Meanwhile Britney would rather unseal details of the case than have them 'hidden away in a closet as a family secret,' her lawyer said in court documents.

The lawyer has also called Free Britney 'Far from being a conspiracy theory' after Jamie spoke to Page Six and dismissed the 'conspiracy theorists' propagating the movement who 'don't know anything.'

Meanwhile: She recommended The Inner Goddess Makeover by Tanishka this week and shared her hopes that it 'will also strengthen my "Just a Touch of Rose" and "RED" projects as well'
