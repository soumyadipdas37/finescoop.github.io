Samaire Armstrong took to Instagram on Wednesday with a detailed post and clip in which she said she was supporting President Donald Trump in upcoming presidential election, after days earlier expressing her ire for the organization Black Lives Matter.

'I’m voting #Trump2020, and this is why,' the actress, 39, captioned the clip. 'This is MY opinion. I am sharing it with you at the cost of everything, because it is my right. It is your right to refute it. What I hope comes from this, is that we are able to have an open dialogue.'

The latest: Samaire Armstrong, 39, took to Instagram on Wednesday with a detailed post and clip in which she said she was supporting President Donald Trump in upcoming presidential election, after days earlier expressing her ire for the organization Black Lives Matter

The Dirty Sexy Money star wrote the time has come to 'stop placating to the emotionally undeveloped, who have an inability to process the meaning of personal responsibility, as if they are the cultural guide of which we should follow.'

The Resurrection star said that she hoped her statement would encourage others to speak their 'opinion, no matter how unpopular it may be,' noting that 'freedom of speech,' 'logic' and 'critical thinking must be restored.'

In the clip, Armstrong said she's an independent voter, and questioned the effectiveness of Democratic leaders including Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama and former Vice President and current Presidential nominee Joe Biden.

'They might look present and placate and pander very well but they're not doing anything - and that's why they hate Trump so much,' she said.

In a prior post referring to the shooting of two Los Angeles Sheriff's deputies, Armstrong said that Black Lives Matter 'has taken us by our heart, has manipulated our mind and contorted our values.

She added: 'This is a act of warfare at the hands of Marxist criminals, "woke" white, angsty uneducated #ANTIFA, who do not have the bandwidth to navigate an indoor golf course, let alone life. They are not bright. They are manipulative criminals. They are puppets, of an agenda. We too have been puppets. This must end now.'

She added, 'White guilt, celebrity endorsement, and corporate pandering has funded this 1 billion dollar domestic terrorist organization.'

Armstong said that organizations like Black Lives Matter and Antifa are 'destroying, and dismantling our first line of defense against criminals.'

'Our policemen and women have been thrown under the bus by spineless politicians,' she said. 'We owe the police our most heartfelt apologies and gratitude for their sacrifice.'

'I know you want the best for Black people. I believe most people do!! I spoke in support of BLM. I wanted to help. This is not what you or I signed up for. Enough is enough.

Armstrong also spoke out when her post was covered by Metro, challenging the publication after they said in their headline that BLM has 'not being linked to a single terror attack.'

Armstong replied, 'I said what I said. Prove me wrong. KKK is a domestic terrorist group. ANTIFA is a domestic terrorist group. Any others?'
