Police investigating the suspected murder of a 23-year-old man in 1992 have been contacted by a witness in what has been described as a 'significant' development.

Steven Clark's elderly parents Doris and Charles Clark have been arrested on suspicion of his murder, and police have been carrying out searches of their home and garden in Marske-by-the-Sea, Cleveland. 

A missing person's report stated that at 3pm on December 28, 1992, during a family walk, the son used the gents' public toilets near the promenade in Saltburn, Cleveland, while his mother went to the ladies'. 

The new witness placed Mr Clark in Marske in the late afternoon, Cleveland Police said. 

A cold case review led detectives to suspect that Steven Clark had been murdered after he was last seen on December 28, 1992, in Saltburn, Cleveland

When he did not come out of the toilets, Mrs Clark said she thought her son had made his own way home, but he was never seen again. 

No body has ever been found. 

A cold case review led detectives to suspect he had been murdered, and his parents were arrested. 

Following public appeals for information, the detective leading the case said a potential witness has come forward to say she saw Steven Clark in Marske late in the afternoon. 

Cleveland Police said the development gave them 'significant information'. 

The force said the potential witness was out with her family and reported that Mr Clark passed them as they were walking on the High Street towards Marske square.

December 28, 1992: Steven Clark is seen going into the gents' public toilets at 3pm in Saltburn, Cleveland, while his mother goes into the ladies. 

When Steven doesn't come out, his mother think he has made his own way home. 

A new witness has placed Steven in Marske later that afternoon, before it got dark at 3.45pm.  

September 1999: An anonymous letter was posted to Guisborough Police Station relating to Steven's disappearance. 

September 15, 2020: Following a cold case review, it is revealed that Steven's elderly parents have been arrested on suspicion of his murder. 

September 16, 2020: After being quizzed for six hours at the pollice station, Steven's parents insist they did not kill their son. 

September 17, 2020: Police investigating murder urge the writer of the anonymous letter in 1999 to make contact. 

September 19, 2020: A tent is set up in at Doris and Charles Clark's home as specialist officers begin investigations in the back garden of the couple's home. 

The man, believed to be Mr Clark, was walking in the opposite direction towards The Ship Inn, and it had not yet got dark.

The force said the woman saw the 1992 appeal for information about Steven’s whereabouts, and confirmed with her family that it was the missing 23-year-old who they had seen, but she did not think it was relevant to the case at that time.

Detective Chief Inspector Shaun Page said: 'This is an important development for us because we know that it got dark that day at around 3.45pm and this potential sighting puts Steven in Marske before that time.

'We have carried out a number of searches in the Marske area and these will be continuing.

'A lot of people knew Steven and I would again appeal for people to come forward with any information, no matter how small or insignificant they think it is.

'I would like to hear from anyone who saw Steven on Christmas bank holiday weekend in 1992, which was Friday December 24 to Monday December 27.”

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Last week the force appealed for an anonymous letter writer who contacted the force in 1999 about the case to come forward.

Police said their records showed the letter was assessed by officers and the information was recorded.

However, the force has not revealed the content of the letter or why it is now seen as important more than 20 years after it was sent.  

Mrs Clark last week denied the couple murdered their son, saying the situation was 'absolutely ludicrous'.

Steven Clark walked with a pronounced limp as a result of a childhood road accident, which also left him with other disabilities.

At the time he disappeared, Mr Clark attended the Rathbone Society in Redcar, which worked with people with disabilities to improve their employment skills, and he had won the Apprentice of the Year Award.

On Saturday morning, five police cars and vans, a crime scene investigation vehicle and an incident command unit could be seen parked outside the semi-detached house.

A cordon was place across a public footpath that runs down the side of the house on Coast Road in the town. And a police tent could seen in the rear garden.
