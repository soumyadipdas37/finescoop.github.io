Meghan Markle would 'seriously consider running for president' if she and Prince Harry ever 'gave up their titles,' a source close to the royal has claimed.

The Duchess of Sussex, 39, and Prince Harry, 35, now ensconced in an L.A. mansion, recently recorded a video message for Times 100 urging Americans to vote, hinting they support Democrat Joe Biden.  

They made their remarks just weeks before the November 3 elections with Americans in some states already going to the polls.  

'One of the reasons she was so keen not to give up her American citizenship was so she had the option to go into politics,' a source close to the couple claimed, speaking to Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl. 'I think if Meghan and Harry ever gave up their titles she would seriously consider running for president.'

However, others working closely with Meghan claimed that she has no intentions of a career in politics. 

'While there's no denying she is interested and engaged in politics as a topic, she harbors no ambition to enter a career in politics herself,' a well-placed source told the publication.

Harry and Meghan made their comments in a Time 100 video to go with the publication of this year's list of the most influential people, which does not include the royal couple.

During the video message, the Duke of Sussex urged people to 'reject hate speech' while the Duchess called it the 'most important election of our lifetime' in remarks which made waves on both sides of the Atlantic.

'As we approach this November, it's vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity,' said Harry – in a line some observers in Britain and the U.S. immediately took to be a plug for Joe Biden and a slap at President Trump.

Said the California-born Markle, 39: 'We're six weeks out from the election, and today is Voter Registration Day.

'Every four years, we're told the same thing, 'This is the most important election of our lifetime. But this one is. When we vote, our values are put into action, and our voices are heard.'

Royal insiders voiced concern in Britain where the Queen and her family are expected to remain politically neutral at all times. 

Buckingham Palace also distanced itself from Harry's remarks by saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the royal family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'. 

Over the past few weeks, Meghan has taken part in multiple interviews and summits - having reportedly grown 'frustrated' at her inability to get involved in politics while she was working as a senior royal.

This week, feminist activist Gloria Steinem revealed that Markle had joined her in cold-calling Americans and urging them to vote.

 Steinem told Access Hollywood: 'She came home to vote. The first thing we did, and why she came to see me, was we sat at the dining room table where I am right now and we cold-called voters.'

'Said 'hello I'm Meg' and 'hello I'm Gloria' and 'are you going to vote?' That was her initiative.'

Meghan also told Steinem she was 'so excited' to see fellow mixed-race woman Kamala Harris nominated for vice president, in another strong hint that she is backing the Democratic ticket. 

Meanwhile, she has also taken in voter appeals, at which she made a bold plea to women across the US to take part in the 2020 presidential election, speaking out about the need for 'change' at an online voter summit, while telling participants: 'If we aren't part of the solution, we are part of the problem.'  

 

Bu while many viewers saw Harry and Meghan's comments as a thinly-veiled endorsement of Biden, a source close to Harry insisted the Duke was not referring to Trump or any other individual.

'The duke was talking about the tone of debate in the run-up to an election which is already quite febrile,' they said.

'He is not talking about any candidate or specific campaign. He is building on a lot of stuff that he's said before about online communities, how we engage with each other online, rather than specifically making any political points.'

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump slammed Meghan Markle from the White House podium following the video message.

'I'm not a fan of hers,' Trump said Wednesday to a question posed by DailyMail.com. 'I would say this - and she has probably heard that - I wish a lot of luck to Harry because he's going to need it.'
