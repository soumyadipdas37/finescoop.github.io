Twitter users in Essex were faced with a more comprehensive weather package last night after logging onto the app to check the county's rainfall.

The BBC Essex twitter account tweeted at 7.50pm last night with their latest weather update but ended up leaving their followers in hysterics when their graphic appeared to resemble something rather rude.

The unfortunately-shaped image has received more than 102,000 like ratings and has been retweeted almost 24,000 times.

BBC weatherman Owain Wyn Evans responded to the rudely-shaped image and said: 'Goodness! That looks to me like a good few inches of rain overnight.'

Another user couldn't quite believe what they were seeing and asked: 'You see it too right?'

Barry Malone, the executive producer of AJStream also tweeted about the picture and said: 'I tried so hard not to be an adolescent and retweet this. I failed.'

Other people were left speechless by the hilarious weather graphic and posted gifs of film characters staring with their mouths open in disbelief.

One Twitter user even compared the tweet by BBC Essex to a hurricane evacuation map distributed earlier this year in Baltimore.

The unfortunate tweet comes as temperatures are set to plummet over the bank holiday which could make it one of the coldest on record, coming just days after the UK experienced record-breaking heat.

Huge downpours and 80mph winds from Storm Francis battered the UK earlier this week, with cold northerly winds gripping the country over the next few days.

The Met Office have warned that very chilly weather is likely to continue into tomorrow - which could be fractionally colder than today - with the coldest night set to be Sunday into Monday.
