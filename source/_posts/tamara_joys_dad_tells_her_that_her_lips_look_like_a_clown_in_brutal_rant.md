Former Married At First Sight star Tamara Joy has copped a brutal spray from her own father over her 'clown' look due to her use of lip fillers.

The reality star shared the awkward exchange on Instagram on Wednesday.

In a series of videos, the 31-year-old's father brought her a coffee in bed, before he unleashed on her love of cosmetic injectables.

That's brutal! Former MAFS star Tamara Joy's dad said that her lips look like a 'clown', are 'ridiculous', and 'unnatural' in a rant that was posted to Instagram on Wednesday 

'The lips. It's old hat. It's in the past. Move on. It's ridiculous,' Tamara's father, Les, is seen telling his daughter in the clip. 

Tamara, to her credit, appears to take the criticism in her stride, as she laughs it off and asks her dad how he has become a lip expert. 

'So, I'm out of fashion because my lips are big?' she asks Les with a laugh, indicating that the pair are close and that their clash was in good fun.

'It's not natural. It looks ridiculous, I think. You look like a clown mate. But that's just ridiculous,' he continued. 

Tamara was heard trying to reason with him as she laughed off his playful opinion: 'That's brutal dad,' she replied. 

Tamara, who previously admitted to getting filler in her lips, showed off a plump pout in a number of short clips prior to her exchange with her dad.

The beauty's pout looked suspiciously larger than usual, indicating that she may have had some recent enhancements.  

The reality star is certainly no stranger to using surgery to change up her look.   

Alongside a nose job and lip fillers, Tamara has also undergone a breast enlargement.

Before and after: Tamara unveiled her new nose for the first time back in September last year. (Pictured: left, before her rhinoplasty, and right, in September after her surgery)

For her rhinoplasty, the socialite sought out the services of renowned facial plastic surgeon Dr Michael Zacharia.

Tamara was spotted wincing in pain as she left Dr Zacharia's clinic in Sydney in September, with a large bandage across her nose.  

Dr Zacharia has previously performed nose jobs on Bachelor stars including Megan Marx and Keira Maguire.

Tamara previously opened up about her cosmetic enhancements in an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle in March last year.

'People do it for all different reasons and I guess mine was just more so… I had a bit of a booty and I really wanted to balance that out, that's why I did it,' she said, referring to her boob job.

She added: 'If it makes you feel better about yourself, why not?'
