A Queensland paedophile has pleaded guilty to forcing his step granddaughter to perform oral sex on him on two occasions.

The 60-year-old, who cannot be named, claimed he was drunk and suffering from alcoholism when he molested the 11-year-old over two days in the Easter school holidays last year.

The child had been staying at her grandparents' home in Redland Bay and told her grandmother what her 'Pop' had done to her the day after the second incident.

The grandmother contacted police and left a note at the home for her husband that read 'I know what you have done', Courier Mail reported.Â

Brisbane District Court heard the man had been pushed away by his neighbours after details of the assault became known and his house had been burned down.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and six offences of indecent treatment of a child under 12 as a guardian.

Judge Vicki Loury QC sentenced him to four years jail for his 'appalling' actions, but ordered his release after 12 months.

'She was only 11 years of age. She was your granddaughter even if not a biological one,' she said.

'You should have been protecting her but instead you betrayed her trust in an appalling way. I accept you are remorseful for your conduct, but the damage has been done.'

The man will remain on probation for three years after his release.
