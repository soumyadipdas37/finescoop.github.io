Real Housewives of Potomac star Monique Samuels has shared her thoughts on late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman following his death last week.

The reality star, 36, and her family were devoted fans of the actor, even going as far as to name their pet bird T'Challa after Chadwick's Black Panther character.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Monique said that the late star's role in the Marvel movie and the way he carried himself in his personal life was an inspiration to the black community.

'It was a moment for black America and the world to see a character that we could relate to and look up to, even though it was a movie,' the mother-of-three explained.

'The excitement that my kids had to finally see this successful black superhero,' she continued.

'It was such a big deal and a great movie and all those things, but to think about myself growing up, if I had something like that, so the fact that my kids were able to witness such a great movie and such a great person who played the role was just amazing,' she added.

'You didn't hear about any Chadwick Boseman scandals behind the scenes, you didn't hear about any of those things, so not only did he play such a great character but he was a great person.'

Monique said that both she and her family were huge fans of Black Panther, to the point that she named her bird T'Challa and themed her son Christopher's sixth birthday party around the Marvel movie. 

'It's hard to put into words the devastation, just knowing that wow, this great person is gone, we lost another person that really represented our community so well,' she continued.

'I'm really proud about the legacy that he left and the fact that he did leave us these incredible movies that we can watch.'

Monique is currently starring on the fifth season of the Real Housewives of Potomac, which airs on Bravo in the US and Hayu in Australia. 

Outside of the show, she recently released the hip-hop single Drag Queens and published a parenting book titled Potty Training "Mommy & Daddy": A Guide For Introducing Infant Potty Training As Early As 6 Months Old.

Chadwick died last week at the age of 43 after a secret four-year battle with colon cancer.

His family announced his passing on Friday night via his social media accounts.

In their note, they wrote that he had been 'diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016,' which later 'progressed to stage IV.'

'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.'

The actor's family also confirmed that many of his greatest movie roles were filmed 'during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.'
