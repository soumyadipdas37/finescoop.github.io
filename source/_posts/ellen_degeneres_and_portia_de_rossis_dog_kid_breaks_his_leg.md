Ellen DeGeneres has described the awful moment her dog Kid broke his leg in an accident at home.

On the second episode of her talk show which returned on Monday, Ellen recalled the incident which happened over the weekend at Ellen and wife Portia de Rossi's Montecito mansion.

'Here's what happened. Over the weekend, our dog Wally, she's a little over a year, so she's a puppy. And she was running full-speed across the lawn.' Ellen recalled.

'Our dog Kid happened to be in the way and she just trampled over Kid, which is illegal because the speed limit is 25 when there's a kid nearby.' she continued jokingly.

'So Kid was screaming in pain and we knew his leg was broken. It was awful, awful, awful.'

The TV host then displayed a photo of the poor pup with a large green cast on his leg while resting up.

Ellen added that her dog will have to wear a cast for 12 weeks.

Meanwhile, Ellen confessed she drank a lot during the lockdown when allegations of the toxic environment on her show started emerging earlier this year.

'Kid was screaming in pain and we knew his leg was broken. It was awful, awful, awful.' Ellen, 62, recalled

A day after she addressed the claims in her opening monologue on Monday, Ellen said, 'We have been stuck at home for months and months. All we did was puzzles and drunk our weight in wine.'

A day prior, on the season premiere of her show, Ellen addressed the scandal surrounding the toxic environment on set.

'If you're watching because you love me, thank you. If you're watching because you don't love me, welcome. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation.'

She continued: 'I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected.

'I know that I'm in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility. And I take responsibility for what happens at my show.'

Ellen also added that she is a 'work in progress and I am especially working on that impatience thing…' 

'I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected.'
