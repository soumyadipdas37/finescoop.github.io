Mayor Bill de Blasio has expanded New York City's five-day furlough to 9,000 city workers, including managerial employees not protected by unions, in order to make $21 million in savings for the cash-strapped Big Apple.

De Blasio announced the furloughs in a press conference Wednesday  and warned that  managerial employees not represented by unions would be affected. 

The furloughs will take place from October through to March 2020. 

'It's a difficult [decision] because it will affect real people and their lives,' de Blasio said. 

'It's something very sad when the people who have worked so hard have to sacrifice further.'
