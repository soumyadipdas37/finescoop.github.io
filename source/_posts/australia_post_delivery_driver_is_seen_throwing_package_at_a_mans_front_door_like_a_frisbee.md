A customer has been left outraged after a postie threw his package 'like a frisbee' at his front door. 

Russell James Noble, who lives in Sydney, shared a video of the careless delivery to Twitter on Monday.

The postman can be seen running to the door before throwing the package onto the front step.

A customer service representative from Australia Post agreed that this behaviour was 'not on'

The package is seen spinning through the air before it hits the ground with a thud.

He then snaps a photo of his work before running off. 

Mr Noble claims it was an Australia Post delivery driver, however the man was not wearing a uniform. 

'Another day, another package frisbee tossed at my door thanks to Aus Post,' Mr Noble captioned the video. 

A customer service representative from Australia Post responded to Mr Noble's tweet, and agreed that the postie's behaviour was 'not on'. 

Mr Noble shared video of a similar incident in May this year.

He told Yahoo News Australia at the time that he checks video footage at his front door every time a package is delivered. 

'They don't place it [down]. They just toss it from some height,' Mr Noble said. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Australia Post and Russell James Noble for comment.
