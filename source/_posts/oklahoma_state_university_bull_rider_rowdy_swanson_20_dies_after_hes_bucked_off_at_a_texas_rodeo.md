A member of the Oklahoma State University Rodeo Team has died after being injured when he was bucked off a bull at the Palo Pinto County Livestock Association's PRCA Pro Rodeo.

Rowdy Swanson, 20, was riding a bull named Gritty, who is owned by Rafter G Rodeo Co. in Terrell, when he sustained the fatal injuries on Thursday night in Mineral Wells, Texas.

According to social media users Swanson was tossed from the bull soon after leaving the chute.

One person who saw a video of the accident said the bull's rear legs seemed to come down on top of Swanson right after he hit the ground then a bullfighter quickly covered Swanson.

According to social media users Rowdy Swanson was tossed from the bull soon after leaving the chute at the PPCLA's PRCA Pro Rodeo in Texas last Thursday

Adult female bulls can weight around 1,200 lbs while males can weigh 1,600 lbs. 

Gary Lothridge wrote on Facebook that Swanson got up and tried to leave the arena and moments later paramedics rushed into the arena.

'With a heavy and aching heart, I am saddened to announce that the OSU Rodeo Team has lost one of our own,' Coach Cody Hollingsworth said in a statement about Rowdy Swanson. 

'He was a big part of our rodeo family and he will be missed immensely. Our thoughts are with the Swanson family at this time.'

Swanson was studying animal science at the university in Stillwater and held a permit while he was attempting to obtain a PRCA membership card.

The rodeo finally took place last Thursday after it was postponed on April 1. 

'The hearts of the entire rodeo community go out to Rowdy's family in this tragic time,' George Taylor, the CEO of PRCA, added. 'We will continue to keep Rowdy and his family in our thoughts and prayers.'
