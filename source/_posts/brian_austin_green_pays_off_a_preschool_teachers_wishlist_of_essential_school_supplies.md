He weighed in on the importance of teacher's amid the coronavirus pandemic on his first ever Instagram Live show late last month.

And Brian Austin Green put his money where his mouth was when he purchased a preschool teacher's entire Amazon wishlist of extra school supplies.

Hoffman told the outlet that she was catching up on Brian's inaugural Instagram Live show from August 29, which ran for almost 40 minutes.

In the final few minutes, the actor updated his fans on the schooling situation for his four children while also saluting teachers who were skilled enough to 'trick' uninterested youngsters into learning. 

Hoffman was inspired by Green's words about teachers, so she tagged him on social media and linked to her Amazon wishlist, which was filled with close to $500 in school supplies.

To her delight, the TV star bought everything on her list for her the same she tagged him.

According to Hoffman, teachers are on the hook for more school supplies than ever due to the coronavirus pandemic, as its no longer safe for children to share most supplies, such as crayons and pencils.

She normally has a school supply budget of around $250, which doesn't cut it for the 15 students she usually teaches.

Like most teachers throughout the US, Hoffman normally has to shell out plenty of her own money to give her students a better learning experience.

The preschool teacher also shared a photo of the gift receipt included with her order, which featured the standard 'Enjoy your gift!' message and was addressed from 'brian green.'

Relationship turmoil: Brian's charitable deed came following his split with his estranged wife Megan Fox, 34, who moved on with rapper Machine Gun Kelly less than a month later; shown together in December 2019 

Brian's charitable deed comes following his separation from his estranged wife Megan Fox, 34.

Earlier in his first Instagram Live video from last month, the Anger Management actor said he would 'never say never' about the possibility of a reconciliation.

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he explained.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added of Fox, who started dating Machine Gun Kelly less than a month after their split. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.'

He continued: 'I’m on my path doing what I feel I need to do to be happy and it’s not for a lack of love for the kids or lack of being responsible, it’s really important to take care of yourself.

'It’s important for us as parents to take care of ourselves. I wish her all the best and I wish myself the best as well,' he said. 

When asked about his opinion on the 30-year-old Bad Things rapper, Green said that he had 'never met him.'
