Over the weekend, Brittany shared a heartfelt tribute to her Father's Day tribute to her dad. 

'Thank you for giving me a lifetime of adventures, a childhood many could only dream of, always off the beaten track,' she wrote. 

'You always made me believe I could do and be anything, so I blame you for all of my crazy life choices! Even when I told you I wanted to be a spy, you told me "anything is possible possum". 

'Love you popsicle home slice,' she added.

Fans will remember Tony when he grilled Bachelor Nick 'Honey Badger' Cummins at the hometown visits back in season six.

Tony told the former rugby player that he had very little respect for footballers. 

'Obviously I don't know you ... I'd never heard your name,' Tony told Nick during a one-on-one chat.

'Then I heard that you're a rugby player and I thought "oh well that's not such a good thing"- I don't have a great deal of respect for football players in terms of their relationship with women.' 

The single life: Brittany had her heart broken by Nick Cummins when he failed to decide between her or Sophie Tieman in 2018. Brittany also failed to find love with Timm Hanly on Bachelor in Paradise earlier this year (pictured together)
