Another elite Sydney private school has been caught up in a muck-up day 'scavenger hunt' scandal.  

Girls from Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College in North Sydney filmed themselves drinking vodka out of a shoe, kissing strangers, licking car tires and jumping into a World War I memorial fountain, as part of their a graduation 'scavenger hunt'.

The videos were uploaded to the social media platform TikTok under the hashtags 'scavhunt' and 'classof2020'. 

It comes just days after Shore School for boys and Pymble Ladies' College went into damage control after documents detailing their muck-up day scavenger hunt was leaked.

A document obtained by 7News outlines how participants from the $23,640 a year Catholic school can receive points for completing embarrassing dares.

'Doing a poo' in a public pool, drinking 'seven shots' of alcohol in seven minutes and wetting yourself in a supermarket aisle is worth 200 points, under the scavenger hunt's rules.

While anyone who gets a tattoo with their ex-partner's name receives 800 points. 

Other challenges also included 'catching an ibis' and 'seducing a classmate's dad'.

It is not known whether the more extreme challenges were actually carried out by any students.

A spokesperson for Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College said they're investigating the matter and take 'this sort of behaviour very seriously'. 

Although the dares have caused controversy, they pale in comparison to the challenges uncovered in the Shore School's 'Triwizard Shorenament' manifesto. 

Some of the scavenger hunt tasks laid out for school leavers included hitting stranger's genitals, spitting on homeless people and kissing underage girls.  

Pymble Ladies' College, also on Sydney's North Shore, made headlines this week with its list of muck-up day challenges.

Like the aforementioned schools, the leaked document appeared to encourage the girls to perform varying levels of sex acts and embarrassing dares to score points for their team.

The school is among the top ranked in New South Wales and regularly features impressive Year 12 results

The list included 'eat someone else's vomit', 'get arrested' and 'have sex in a public bathroom.'

Other challenges involved 'streaking across the Pacific Highway' and 'blindfold boyfriend guess whose t*** are who for everyone in the team'.

The unladylike list also asked students to 'order a stripper and enjoy his/her presence', 'get with someone's brother' and 'go into a brothel and ask for a job'. 

The 'God tier' level of challenges included 'ring parent and explain in depth how you lost your virginity' and 'meet up with someone' from LGBTQ dating app Grindr.

A spokesperson from Pymble Ladies' College said muck-up day activities were against school policy and students had been warned of the consequences.

'We are horrified and disappointed that any student would have their name associated with what was apparently a competitive list between students at a number of schools,' the spokesperson said.
