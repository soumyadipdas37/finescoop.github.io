Hundreds of refugees are being transferred from the Greek island of Lesbos tonight in a bid to reduce chronic overcrowding that caused hardship and fanned tensions with locals.

Over 700 people are set to sail to the Greek mainland aboard a ferry on Monday organisers said while another group will leave on Thursday.

Some 2,500 refugees and asylum seekers are to be relocated overall, following coronavirus tests, according to the migration ministry. 

It comes three weeks after the sprawling Moria camp on the island burned down leaving more than 12,000 asylum seekers homeless on September 8.

The fire broke out shortly after more than 30 people there tested positive for coronavirus.

Some 2,500 refugees and asylum seekers are to be relocated overall (some of the group being transferred today), following coronavirus tests, according to the migration ministry

It comes three weeks after the sprawling Moria camp on the island burned down (the remains of the camp, pictured) leaving more than 12,000 asylum seekers homeless on September 8

Six Afghan youths are on trial for arson in connection to the fire. They deny the charges.

The Moria camp was notorious for overcrowding, poor sanitation and ethnic gang violence.

Also Monday, Greek police said they had identified 33 aid workers who allegedly facilitated illegal migration to Lesbos.

A Greek police source later said the 'preliminary' investigation was still under way.

A police statement said the suspects, who worked for four non-governmental organisations, were part of 'an organised network' created to 'systematically' facilitate illegal migration to the island.

Two other foreign nationals - identified by state TV ERT as an Afghan and an Iranian - were also part of the alleged operation, the police said.

No information was given on the aid groups in question, the identities of the suspects, or whether any were already in custody. 

Police said the alleged operation was active from at least June, 'providing substantial assistance to organised migrant-smuggling networks' by helping direct migrant boats to shore safely.

Meanwhile, Germany has offered to take 1,500 asylum seekers from Greece, including former Moria residents.

For its part France has offered to take in 500 minors from the camp.

Authorities and local residents on Lesbos had long campaigned for the immediate removal of most of the asylum seekers.

After the camp burned down, a makeshift tent facility was hurriedly erected to house some 9,500 people.

But the temporary camp, on a hill overlooking the sea, is ill-equipped to handle winter conditions.

The government is now in talks to build a smaller permanent camp on the island.
