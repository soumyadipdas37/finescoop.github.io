Lauren pouted away for the camera, showcasing a natural-tone of make-up for her leisurely look.

This follows a recent interview in which she discussed her OnlyFans account and insisted she does not let her page get too racy for fear of jeopardising future relationships.

She said: 'I already post pictures on Instagram so I thought why not get paid for it? I don't regret it. I don't do anything nude or too sexy. I still want to get married in the future and I don't do anything to jeopardise anything.'

In July, Lauren revealed that she had opened an account on the X-rated subscription service, two years after floating the idea of signing up. At the time she revealed that she is charging $50 a month for access.

Sharing a snap of herself pouting as she posed for a close-up selfie, the erstwhile reality star wrote: 'I’ve given in! To all my fans who want to see me on only fans the time is now... subscribe #dailycontent.'

As she was probed about the account by the panel, Lauren said: 'It was started by a guy in Essex which was later bought by a guy in America...

'I judged it for two years and they tried to get me on. I already post pictures on Instagram so I thought why not get paid for it? I don't regret it...

Wow! Lauren litters social media with sizzling snaps 

The whole group! The ladies were intrigued by Lauren's take on things 

'I don't do anything nude or too sexy. I still want to get married in the future and I don't do anything to jeopardise anything.'

Lauren also discussed her absence from the recent TOWIE 10th anniversary show. 

She said: 'I wasn't available that day and it was more about people currently on the show. I have a lot of love for it but I've been there and done that. I put out a social media shout-out and will always support it...

'It's where I started. It was strange and weird as there weren't any other reality shows. I left the show 7/8 years ago and I'm still very current. I've experienced such great things that I wouldn't have had without it.'

Lauren also discussed her terrifying hospitalisation on Boxing Day. 

She said: 'I suffer with anxiety, a new thing I formed over the years after coming to fame. It's a feeling that feels like you're dying but it's not a real thing...

At Christmas, I had everyone at my house and I felt like I was having a heart attack the day after. I collapsed, couldn't breathe, my heart was racing and I called an ambulance. They did checks, took me to anxiety and told me I had an anxiety attack...

'It feels awful. I first had a panic attack on aeroplane, it's been about for about eight years. I just need to recognise what it is and that I'm not going to die.'
