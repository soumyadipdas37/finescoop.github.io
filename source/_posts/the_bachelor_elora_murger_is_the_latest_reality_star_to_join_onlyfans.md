Former Bachelor star Elora Murger has become the latest celebrity to join the subscription-based adult website OnlyFans.

The brunette made the announcement on Wednesday, sharing a raunchy photo to Instagram of herself in a G-string and white crop top.

'I have just created an OnlyFans account so I can post cheeky photos without shocking the family or my little staff,' she told her 69,000 followers.

Elora explained that there were many sides to her personality, but she wanted to express her sexual side on an appropriate platform. 

She described herself as a reality TV star, a business owner, a wife and animal lover. 

'But I also have a wild side I love to express in photos!' she added. 'Thank you for following my journey.'

Fans can subscribe for $15 a month to view Elora's content. Alternatively, they can pay $40 for three months' access or $72 for six months.

Elora and her Australian husband were hit hard by the coronavirus recession, and were unable to secure government support in April after their café closed.

Their business 'did not qualify for government help' because Elora has not lived in Australia for more than ten years.

She had been forced to close her Moolooaba café, The Rusty Batch, in March.  

Elora told Daily Mail Australia at the time that she felt 'at risk' staying open because some customers didn't appear to be taking COVID-19 seriously. 

'To be honest, a lot of them [customers] weren't taking this seriously, unfortunately,' she said.

'This is why I feel like I'm at risk here, because a lot of people are saying, "Nah, it's just a flu." But now people are starting to really worry about it.'

Elora joins a slew of reality stars who have joined OnlyFans in recent months.

The Bachelorette's Paddy Colliar, Love Island's Vanessa Sierra, and Married At First Sight's Rhyce Power are all making money on the subscription-based platform.

OnlyFans charges users a monthly fee to view explicit photos and videos, which range from suggestive selfies to hardcore pornography.    

Rhyce, who shot to fame as Jessika Power's 'hot brother' on Married At First Sight last year, is currently one of the top creators on OnlyFans.

The former carpenter, 28, recently shared his earnings from the site on Instagram, revealing he had made more than $50,000 in just one month.
