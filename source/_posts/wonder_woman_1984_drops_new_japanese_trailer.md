Warner Bros dropped a new trailer for Wonder Woman 1984 on Friday.

The 88 second long promotional tool is to promote the Japanese release of the long-awaited superhero sequel and extends some of the fight scenes featured in previous English-language trailers.

The teaser comes just weeks after the fifth release date shakeup for the highly-anticipated sequel.

This latest trailer notably gives fans another look at Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) golden armor, worn during a fight sequence with Cheetah (Kristen Wiig).

At one point Wonder Woman can be seen crossing her gold-clad arms to deflect an incoming bullet, a shot only very briefly hinted at in the film's first full-length trailer. 

The new trailer also gives fans another look at Max Lord, the film's chief villain, played by Pedro Pascal (Game of Thrones).

The sequel to the hugely-successful 2017 film starring Gal Gadot, is moving from an October debut to Christmas, according to Deadline.

This marks the fifth release date shakeup for the highly-anticipated sequel, which was initially slated to hit theaters in December 13, 2019, then pushed up a month to November 1. 

However, after the Joker's October release date was announced, the Patty Jenkins-directed flick was moved to June 5, 2020.

Multiple delays: The sequel to the hugely-successful 2017 film starring Gal Gadot, is moving from an October debut to Christmas, according to Deadline 

With the ongoing coronavirus raging and movie theaters largely closed, those plans were scrapped and changed to August 14, then October 2 and, now, December 25. 

'First and foremost let me say how much Gal [Gadot] and I love all our devoted Wonder Woman fans around the world, and your excitement for WW84 couldn’t make us happier or more eager for you to see the movie,' the film's Oscar-winning director said in a statement, obtained by Deadline on Friday. 

Jenkins explained: 'Because I know how important it is to bring this movie to you on a big screen when all of us can share the experience together, I’m hopeful you won’t mind waiting just a little bit longer.'

Star-studded cast: Along with Gadot in the titular role, the sequel also stars Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Kristen Wiig, Pedro Pascal and Connie Nielsen

As for the Christmas release, she noted she 'couldn't wait to spend the holidays' with fans through in theaters.   

The original film, that was also directed by Jenkins, turned into a blockbuster hit, grossing $821.8 million at the worldwide box office.

As the coronavirus pandemic remains a major factor around the globe, Hollywood is continuing to grapple with ongoing movie theater closures. 

In addition to Wonder Woman 1984, Milla Jovovich's latest big budget film Monster Hunter was pushed from this fall to next spring. 

The news also follows the less-than-stellar theatrical debut of Christopher Nolan's Tenet, which was delayed from its scheduled July 17 to August 12.
