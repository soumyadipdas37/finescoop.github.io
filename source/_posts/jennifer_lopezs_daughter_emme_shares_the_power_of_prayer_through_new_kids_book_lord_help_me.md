Her mother is a global superstar having worked in the entertainment industry for more than 30 years.

And Jennifer Lopez's daughter Emme Muñiz is venturing into the literary world with the release of her children's book, Lord Help Me.

The 12-year-old (who calls Marc Anthony father) told PEOPLE magazine that she wasn't too afraid to step back into the spotlight after performing with her mother in front of millions of fans during the Super Bowl halftime show in February.

'I just don't overthink it,' she said of singing alongside her mother. 'I get up there and do it.' 

Not only did Emme sing during the most popular 10 minutes of television, she's also gone on tour with her mom and appeared on stage during Lopez's It's My Party Tour.

When it comes to creating the book, Emme looked within to find a subject that mattered most — prayer.

Sweetheart: No matter what happens in the future, Emme said both of her parents are 'really proud of me' (seen in 2019)

'I really hope children are able to learn to pray, share the book and spread the power of prayer after reading it,' she said.

The little girl noted the she uses prayer to navigate 'big and small' challenges throughout the day, but communicating with her twin brother Max has never been an issue. 

'Max and I have a special relationship,' Emme said. 'Since we were very little, I could always understand him when no one else could.' 

Family business: Not only did Emme sing during the most popular 10 minutes of television, she's also gone on tour with her mom and appeared on stage during Lopez's It's My Party Tour

And if she doesn't jump into the family business, Emme's other passion is working with animals. 

'I want to donate to organizations that build sloth sanctuaries,' she said.

No matter what happens in the future, Emme said both of her parents are 'really proud of me.'
