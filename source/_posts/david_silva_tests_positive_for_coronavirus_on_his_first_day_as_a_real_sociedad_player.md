David Silva has tested positive for coronavirus on his first day as a Real Sociedad player after being officially unveiled just hours before by the LaLiga club.

The former Manchester City star has returned a positive covid-19 test on the same day he was revealed in his new club's colours at Sociedad's Anoeta Stadium.

The club tweeted: 'Real Sociedad informs that @21LVA has tested positive for COVID-19 in the test carried out at Policlinica Gipuzkoa. The player is asymptomatic and is self-isolating.'

The midfielder was officially unveiled as Real Sociedad player after leaving Manchester City

The 34-year-old received multiple offers from clubs around the world, after he reportedly came close to a deal with Serie A side Lazio and also attracted interest from David Beckham's MLS club Inter Miami.

However, the Spaniard opted for a move back to his homeland and recently donned the Sociedad strip for the first time as he arrival was officially announced. 

Silva will wear the number 21 shirt for Sociedad - the same number he wore at City, Valencia and for Spain. 

Upon his arrival, Silva explained that he chose to join the LaLiga side, who finished sixth last season, due to their style of play despite having 'great offers' from other clubs.

Silva admitted that the Sociedad's style of play was the reason he chose to join the LaLiga side

'I chose this club for the style of play that distinguishes it,' the creative midfielder said.

'I cannot deny that some personal reasons also influenced this choice but now I am happy to be back in Spain. 

'The fact that I had already played in Eibar (Andalusian club) had an impact because I had a great time, to come here I refused great offers from all over the world.' 

The Spaniard enjoyed an incredibly successful time at the Etihad Stadium after joining City in 2010 for a fee in the region of £25million to £30million.

He won four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and five League Cups with City but could never quite help steer them to their first ever Champions League trophy.

He will compete in the Europa League next season, after Sociedad's sixth-placed finish last campaign saw them qualify for the group stages of UEFA's sister tournament.
