Arsenal have confirmed that Henrikh Mkhitaryan has joined Roma on a permanent basis following his successful loan spell.

The Gunners terminated Mkhitaryan's contract by mutual consent to allow him to join Roma on a free transfer, as reported by the club's official website. 

Despite having struggled for consistency during his time at Arsenal, Mkhitaryan was rather impressive for Roma last season - he scored nine goals and provided six assists in 27 appearances.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan has joined Roma on a permanent basis following his successful loan spell

Mkhitaryan joined Arsenal from Manchester United in January 2018 as part of a swap deal, with Alexis Sanchez heading in the other direction. 

Although he had a fantastic debut against Everton in which he provided three assists, Mkhitaryan struggled at times for Arsenal and looked devoid of confidence on some occasions.

In total he played 59 times for Arsenal, scoring nine goals and getting 13 assists. 

Mkhitaryan thanked former Gunners boss Arsene Wenger as he said goodbye to the club.

He tweeted: ''I‘m delighted to announce that I’ve permanently joined the #giallorossi

'I‘d like to thank @arsenal, its personnel & the millions of #gunners all whom supported me over the past 1,5Y. A special thanks to A. Wenger for having brought me to the club and for his trust in me.'



Arsenal allowed Mkhitaryan, who struggled at the club, to leave for Roma on a free transfer

The Armenia international's temporary switch to Roma certainly brought out the best in him as his performances started to resemble something like the form that he showed at Borussia Dortmund. 

Mkhitaryan will hope to push on further at Roma, who finished in fifth place in Serie A last season.

While Mkhitaryan has left, another player who was sent out on loan last season, Mohamed Elneny, appears to be back in the fold at Arsenal, temporarily at least, with the midfielder having featured in the Community Shield success against Liverpool.
