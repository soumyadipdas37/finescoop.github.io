They recently returned from a sun-soaked getaway to the Greek island of Mykonos.

And Jess and Eve Gale kept the good times rolling on as they dined at Sumosan Twiga in Knightsbridge with their fellow Love Islanders on Wednesday evening.

Turning heads, former VIP hostess Jess, 21, put on a busty display in a black satin bralet, while her twin exuded confidence in tiny Daisy Dukes to showcase her lean legs.

The winter Love Island finalist highlighted her curvaceous figure in clingy PVC-style jeans, and boosted her frame in clear perspex heels.

Glamorous waves, a Louis Vuitton purse and dewy make-up rounded off Jess' stunning appearance.

Influencer Eve, meanwhile, dared to be bold in her barely-there denim shorts, which she dressed up with an asymmetric white top and similar footwear to her sister. 

Proving less is more, the reality star carried her essentials in a tiny Fendi clutch and opted for minimal accessories.

Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched Uzor, 23, during the pandemic.  

It's been reported that lockdown made it impossible for the couple to 'build a relationship' as they were unable to meet up with one another. 

In a statement shared with MailOnline, the blonde beauty confirmed the COVID-19 lockdown played a role in the demise of their romance, but insisted they continue to be friends.

The statement read: 'After a whirlwind romance in the Love Island villa, unfortunately Jessica Gale and Ched Uzor have made the mutual decision to split.

'They have unfortunately felt the effects of lockdown separation but will continue as friends. 

'They wish nothing but the best for each other and full success in each others careers.'
