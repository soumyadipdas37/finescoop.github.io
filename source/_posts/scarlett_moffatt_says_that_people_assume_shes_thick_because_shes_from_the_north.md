She's been a regular face on TV since entertaining the nation with her hilarious comments on Gogglebox.

And Scarlett Moffatt, 29, has now revealed that she believes she is often stereotyped and mistaken for being 'thick'.

Scarlett told The Mirror: 'I just can't win. Maybe it's the way I've portrayed myself, but people always assume I'm thick. I don't know if it's my accent or whatever.'  

'Can't win': Scarlett Moffatt, who is from County Durham, has said she believes people always assume she's 'thick' and she doesn't know if it's because of her accent

The media personality went on to explain how while working she was once told how to do something three times by a producer.

Although not revealing which job she was doing at the time, Scarlett explained how she had to keep replying that she understood what was being asked of her. 

Scarlett said: 'You can’t win, so you’ve just got to be yourself and not take anything personally. It’s other people’s ­ignorance and them being ­uneducated, not you.'

The beauty, who was born in Bishop Auckland in County Durham, shot to fame on Gogglebox and went on to win I'm A Celebrity in 2016.

Speaking out: The TV personality added the assumption is down to 'other people’s ­ignorance'

Since then she has appeared on Streetmate, Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and The British Tribe Next Door.

While before finding fame on TV Scarlett studied PE and Sports Coaching at York St John University.

Scarlett's comments come after she threw her mother Betty a fabulous 50th birthday celebration complete with a pop-up pub and silent disco. 

With coronavirus restrictions still in place, only 30 people could come to the party but Scarlett along with her father Mark and sister Ava, 14, made the most of the day. 

Party: Scarlett recently proved she knows how to throw a party as she surprised her mother Betty with a family get together for her 50th birthday

The pop-up had a real bar with staff pouring drinks while Scarlett's boyfriend Scott Dobinson also helping out with the festivities.

Scarlett also organised entertainment for the day, with a swing dancer and keyboardist serenading the audience before a disco began later in the evening.   

Betty, who found fame with Scarlett and her father when they were all castmembers on Gogglebox, sported platinum blonde locks for the bash.

All together: The TV presenter went all out for her mum's special day with the help of her father Mark and her sister Ava, 14, who she joked looked 'slightly different' compared to when she was on the Gogglebox sofa

She also posed with her celebrity crush Robert De Niro as Scarlett had a cardboard cut out of the actor to hand. 

Sharing a snap of the family together, Scarlett joked Ava 'looks slightly different to what she did on the Gogglebox sofa' as she is now a teenager.

She added: 'My mama's surprise 50th. Here's a little sneak peek at how it went. Was hard only having 30 guests (due to Covid) but I still think I should become a party planner.'

Bash: Scarlett made the most of the day with an inflatable pop-up pub in the garden which had staff pouring drinks for the guests
