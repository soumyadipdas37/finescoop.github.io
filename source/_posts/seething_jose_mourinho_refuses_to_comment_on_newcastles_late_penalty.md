Jose Mourinho would've liked to say a few more things in his interview following Tottenham Hotspur's draw with Newcastle United on Sunday, but avoided a fine by keeping quiet. 

Newcastle were given a last minute penalty in yet another handball controversy, and Callum Wilson made it 1-1 at the death with their only shot on target in the whole game.  

'If I want to give some money away I'll give it to charity, not to the FA,' Mourinho told Sky Sports. 'So, I prefer not to comment.'

Jose Mourinho would not comment on a late controversial penalty given to Newcastle United

Andy Carroll latched onto a header from a late free-kick, and the ball came off Eric Dier's arm. 

The Tottenham man was just inches away, and was facing in the other direction, however since his arm was in an 'unnatural position,' the spot kick was given after a VAR check.
