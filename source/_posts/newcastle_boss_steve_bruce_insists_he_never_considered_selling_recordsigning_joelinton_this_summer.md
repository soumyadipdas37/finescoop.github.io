Steve Bruce says he never considered getting rid of Newcastle's record-signing Joelinton this summer.

The £40million striker returns to Spurs on Sunday - the scene of his first Premier League goal - but he has scored just once in the top-flight in the 13 months since that 1-0 victory.

Bruce, though, insists he will not give up on the Brazilian, who netted twice during Wednesday's 7-0 win at League Two Morecambe in the EFL Cup.

'There was no temptation whatsoever to let him go,' he said.

'We saw with the second goal at Morecambe (top corner from 20 yards), it gives you a clue to his ability. We see it - or I see it - on the training ground.

'The thing he has to come to terms with is adapting to the Premier League, and he has struggled with that, like a lot of great players.

'I think Joe will benefit from the fact he understands what is coming more now. He still has improvement in him. I had no intention of letting Joe go anywhere, we have to keep working with him.

'He will certainly get a little bit of confidence from scoring a couple the other night. Because, when you're constantly kicked, sometimes it can bash away at you, and no-one is immune to that. We will keep supporting him. We have to find it and get the best out of him.'

Meanwhile, Bruce said he could not comment on Sportsmail's revelation this week that two of his senior medical staff have been stood down pending an internal investigation.

First-team physio Michael Harding and masseur Wayne Farrage have agreed not to work while the club's process is ongoing.
