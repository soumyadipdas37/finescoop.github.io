Gemma Collins has begged fans to listen to Boris Johnson after the Prime Minister's address to the nation on Tuesday night. 

The former TOWIE star, 39, took to Instagram on Wednesday to issue an important message to her followers of how they should stick to the tougher restrictions. 

Boris has imposed a set of new restrictions, including a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants, indoor sports subject to the rule of six, and people working from home where possible- all of which could last for six months.

It comes after the reality star revealed she has developed a bit of a crush on Boris Johnson, following his weight loss. 

Talking to PlayOJO bingo, Gemma said last week: 'It's really encouraging to see Boris taking action to tackle the issue of obesity in our country. 

'Boris has lost some weight himself recently – I saw him on the news the other day with his weight loss and his holiday tan and I thought "Boris looks a bit of a sort".

'Bless you Boris – losing weight will make anyone feel better.'

The Prime Minister, 56, has lost at least a stone in weight and has enlisted the help of a personal trainer after recovering from coronavirus.   

Earlier this month, Gemma furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat'.

Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body. 

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand. So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' 

Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.
