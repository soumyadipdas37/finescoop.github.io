Kendrick Lamar may finally have new music coming, with the rapper spotted filming what appears to be a new music video project.

The 33-year-old King Kunta rapper was spotted in downtown Los Angeles, sitting on a crate on the 4th Street Bridge and talking on a pay phone.

Lamar has not released a full-length album since 2017's Damn, though this music video project could be an indication that a new album is forthcoming.

Lamar was spotted wearing a white sweatshirt and brown shorts, as he was seen sitting on a crate talking on a pay phone.

He had an olive green bandanna around his head and wore white socks pulled up to his calves with black Converse All-Star sneakers.

He was later seen wearing a grey sweatshirt with a black bandanna tired around his neck, along with black shorts, white socks and white Nike Cortez sneakers.

Lamar's last musical project was producing and curating the soundtrack for the 2018 blockbuster Black Panther, starring the late Chadwick Boseman, who passed away last week.

Lamar's song All the Stars was nominated for Best Original Song at the Academy Awards, though another song from the soundtrack Lamar was involved in sparked a lawsuit in February.

Both Lamar and The Weeknd were sued by a now-defunct Brooklyn band called Yeasayer, who claimed Lamar and The Weeknd's song Pray For Me infringed on their 2007 song Sunrise.

Lamar's last full-length album, 2017's Damn, his fourth studio album, was a critical and commercial success.

Damn was the top-selling album of 2017, and it was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

It would go on to be named as one of the top albums of the year by many publications, won Best Rap Album at the Grammys and became the first non-jazz or classical album to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2018.

Lamar most recently launched a new business venture in March known as pgLang, described as a multi-language artist-friendly service company.

Lamar launched the company with David Free, who said the company is not a traditional movie studio or record company or publishing house.

'This is something new. In this overstimulated time, we are focused on cultivating raw expression from grassroots partnership,' he said.
