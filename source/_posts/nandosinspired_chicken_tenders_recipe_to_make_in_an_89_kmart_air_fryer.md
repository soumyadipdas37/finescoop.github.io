A home cook has shared a simple recipe for Nando's-inspired chicken tenderloins at home using an air fryer.

The man, from Perth, used just two supermarket items to create the dish - chicken breast and Nando's PERi-PERi Marinade with medium heat, which costs $5.75 for a 250g bottle from supermarket stores like Coles and Woolworths.

To make the meal, he cut the chicken into strips and baste each piece in the sauce.

The man then baked the strips in his $89 Kmart air fryer for 15 minutes on 180 degrees Celsius, until golden and crispy on the outside.
