Lily James and Harry Styles are in talks to star in an untitled film adaptation of the book My Policeman.

According to a report from Deadline on Thursday, Amazon Studios have won the bid to produce the film with Michael Grandage in the director's chair, and they are keen for the singer, 26, and actress, 31, to star.

Set in Brighton in the late 1957, Bethan Roberts' gay-themed novel focuses on police officer Tom Burgess who is gay but chooses to marry schoolteacher Marion due to social expectations in the era.

Despite this, Tom embarks on an affair with Patrick after the latter falls in love at first sight when they meet at Brighton Museum years later.

Marion becomes jealous when she discovers their passionate relationship, and decides to take drastic action during a time when homosexuality was illegal. 

It is believed that Lily and Harry are in talks to portray lead stars Marion and Tom, and production is set to begin on the film next year. 

The film will be adapted by Oscar-nominee Ron Nyswaner, and Amazon will be working with Berlanti Schechter Productions.

It was announced earlier this month that Harry replaced Shia LaBeouf as the star of Don't Worry, Darling.

The Fine Line singer made his acting debut in 2017 film Dunkirk and producers were apparently impressed with his efforts in the war flick.

It has long been questioned what Harry's next acting project would be and fan's prayers have been answered as director Olivia Wilde confirmed via Instagram that he has signed to her next film.

Harry's co-stars in the thriller include Florence Pugh [Little Women] and Chris Pine [Star Trek], who both signed on to the film earlier this year. 

Olivia said of Harry and Florence's casting: 'Jack and Alice. Very proud to work with these fine folks.' 

Sources told Deadline after impressing director Olivia and Florence during an initial meeting, the feeling was mutual to get him to sign on.

Don't Worry, Darling is the next directing outing for Olivia, who previously directed Booksmart and is slated to be the head of a new Marvel film.
