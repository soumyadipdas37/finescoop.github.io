Natalia Vodianova has married her billionaire partner Antoine Arnault in an intimate ceremony in Paris.  

The Russian model and philanthropist, 37, shared a picture of herself and her new husband, 42, who is the son of LVMH boss Bernard, on Instagram beaming as they walked out of the registry office to a crowd of cheering guests yesterday.

The bride wore a stunning cream collared Ulyana Sergeenko Couture dress for the event, which features pretty purple collar detailing and a cinched white belt at the waist.

The couple, who have been together for 10 years, had initially planned to marry on 27 June at the Saint-Pierre d'Hautvillers Abbey but cancelled the big day amidst the Covid-19 crisis.

Natalia wore her dirty blonde locks in loose curls for the occasion and opted to keep her makeup natural, with a touch of gloss swept across her lips.

She carried a small bouquet of flowers, which added a touch of colour to her all white outfit.

Meanwhile Antoine opted for a dark blue suit with a white shirt and a bright blue tie. 

The happy couple were met by cheering guests as they left the civil ceremony, many of whom could be seen wearing masks as they threw confetti onto the newly weds.

They are reportedly set to have a real 'religious wedding' at a later date. 

Appearing on Suzie Menke's podcast Creative Conversations in June, she revealed the couple had planned to host their wedding guests at a gala dinner at Ruinart's house. 

She also explained that her wedding dress was not yet ready for the event, because she had not been able to try it on amid the Covid-19 restrictions.

She revealed she had been inspired by shots from the wedding of Grace Kelly, but wanted a 'more rock and roll version' of the dress. 

The couple, who have been together for 10 years, postponed their original plans amid the Covid-19 crisis 

The supermodel and Berluti's CEO, whose father, Bernard, chairs the brand and is the boss of the world's largest luxury-goods company, LVMH Moet Hennessy, have been together for 10 years. 

Mogul Bernard's estimated £84billion fortune makes him the world's richest person after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft's Bill Gates.

Natalia is a longtime ambassador for cosmetics and perfume maker Guerlain, owned by LVMH, as well as the founder and head of the Naked Heart Foundation, which builds playgrounds and supports families of children with special needs in Russia. 

Vogue cover star Natalia confirmed her engagement by sharing a picture with friends on New Year's Eve of her brandishing a sizeable sparkler on her ring finger while enjoying a warm embrace with Antoine.

'This year has been beautiful and very memorable,' Natalia, who has two children, Maxim, five, and Roman, three with her future husband, captioned the image.

'2020 here we come. I can't wait to celebrate [the new] year with our loved ones', the delighted star added.

Mother-of-five Natalia, who also shares Lucas, 18, Neva, 13 and Viktor, 12, with her ex-husband Justin Portman, was raised in the Russian neighbourhood of Nizhny Novgorod and would help make ends meet by working on a fruit stand.

Aged 15, she was signed up by a modelling agency and went on to become a household name in fashion.
