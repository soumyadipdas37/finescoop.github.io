A woman who was forced to cancel her trip to Europe because of coronavirus has taken home $1million in lottery winnings. 

The lucky winner, from Morphett Vale in Adelaide's south, scored the division one prize in Monday's Lotto X draw.

The winning numbers in draw 4010 were 22, 35, 18, 1, 4 and 8, and the supplementary numbers were 14 and 38.

She told The Lott that she only bought the Lotto X ticket from Campbell's Newsagency at Southgate Plaza because she wasn't holidaying.

'We'd booked a trip to Europe, and we were supposed to be there now,' she said. 

'It's strange to think that if we had been in Europe, I wouldn't have purchased this ticket and won $1million.'

When the woman and her husband do finally get to Europe, they will fly business class. 

She also revealed the winnings will be spent fixing things around the home she shares with her husband.

'I'm still working, but I might look to retire soon. You never really know what's ahead. It will be handy to have this as a nest egg.'

The woman held one of the two winning division one tickets, with the second lucky South Australian from Salisbury, north of Adelaide, yet to come forward.

The ticket is unregistered, which means officials from The Lott have no way of contacting the winner and have to wait for them to come forward to claim their prize. 

A spokeswoman from The Lott urged Monday X Lotto players to check their tickets.

'You may have woken up a newly-minted millionaire and gone about your day completely oblivious.'
