Fitness queen Kayla Itsines put her Adelaide home on the market last week, just days after announcing her split from fiancé Tobi Pearce.

And it seems there are plenty of buyers interested in her stunning five-bedroom house, which is located in the leafy suburb of Malvern.

It is one of the most-viewed properties in South Australia and the second most-viewed in the entire country, according to Realestate.com.au.

Kayla and Tobi announced their split on Instagram on August 21.

The former couple share a 17-month-old daughter named Arna Leia, and created a global fitness empire estimated to be worth $696million.

'After eight years together, Tobi and I have come to the difficult decision to separate as a couple. We will always be family, and remain good friends and devoted parents to Arna,' Kayla wrote at the time. 

'We have grown up together in Adelaide, sharing a lifetime of experiences and special memories from moving into our first apartment and starting SWEAT from our lounge room to becoming parents to our beautiful daughter.

'Our friendship remains strong as we parent Arna together and run SWEAT as business partners. Thank you for your support and kindness during this time.'

After meeting in late 2012, the pair launched the Bikini Body Training Company and went on to amass a following of more than 20 million fitness enthusiasts worldwide thanks to their workouts, app and health books. 

They launched the Sweat app in May 2017, creating the largest online community for women's fitness, and netting them more than $400million in just one year.

The pair were named joint fifth on the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List in 2018, making them the wealthiest self-made twentysomethings in Australia.
