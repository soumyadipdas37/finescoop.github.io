Two-time Grammy nominee Demi Lovato reportedly informed her fiancé Max Ehrich that their six-month relationship was over despite his claim that he discovered the news in the press last Thursday.

The 29-year-old actor alleged Saturday morning that cast and crew of his film Southern Gospel witnessed him learning about his break-up 'in a tabloid' while on the Atlanta set.

'This is the God's honest truth of how I found out about the ending of the engagement,' Max wrote to his 1.6M Instagram followers.

'To find out over the Internet was beyond anything I could've ever imagined a person could do to another human. Leave me alone.'

However, a source told People on Saturday that the 28-year-old pop star made Ehrich 'aware that the relationship was over and it was going to come out in the press.'

Since then Lovato and the four-time Daytime Emmy nominee have completely wiped each other from their respective social media accounts.

Demi - who's a recovering addict - met Max in March, began quarantining together immediately, and they got engaged in July.

Since September 12, Ehrich has been filming his role as rock star-turned-preacher Samuel Allen, and he got baptized by his director and City of Life Church senior pastor Jeffrey Smith last Friday.

Meanwhile, the former Disney Channel star burned sage on Saturday in an Instastory tagging designer Edie Parker and healer Jennifer Schaefer.

Lovato - who boasts 200M social media followers - then ate Taco Bell and watched a UFC match with her mother Dianna De La Garza, pal Gabe, and British chef Lee Scott Beaumont.

Career-wise, Demi's three years in the making collaboration with DJ Marshmello - Ok Not to Be Ok - topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Sales Chart last Thursday.
