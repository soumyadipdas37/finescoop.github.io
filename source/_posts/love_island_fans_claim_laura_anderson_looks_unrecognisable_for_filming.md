They all met on the fourth series of hit reality dating show Love Island.

And Laura Anderson reunited with a couple of her co-stars on Tuesday, as she posed for a socially-distanced snap with Dr Alex George and Jack Fincham.

The group posed outside a grand mansion as they met up for filming, which is likely to be in relation to the new show spin-off, Love Island: Where Are They Now?

The former air hostess, 31, looked stylish in ivory silk co-ords, which consisted of a cropped blouse, teamed with a flippy mini skirt, tied at the waist.

Laura styled her highlighted locks in loose curls, while enhancing her pretty features with a heavy glamorous coat of make-up.

Meanwhile, former pen salesman Jack, 26, also opted for a two-piece, as he rocked a vertically striped polo shirt and blue shorts.

Jack later shared another sweet snap of the trio on his Stories and captioned it: 'Love you two @lauranderson1x @dralexgeorge.' 

Dr Alex sported a low-key look, as he donned a black T-shirt and jeans, teamed with a denim jacket and a pair of white trainers.

The outing comes a day after Dr Alex returned to social media after taking a break to look after his mental health following the tragic death of his brother Llyr.

Elsewhere, a number of former Love Island stars have reportedly been left outraged, after allegedly being snubbed from appearing in an upcoming reunion special.

The three-part special, said to be called Love Island: Where Are They Now?, was originally planned to be restricted to the top four contestants from each series, but exceptions have reportedly been made − sparking alleged feuds.

A source told The Sun: 'Those involved are very excited, but it has put a few noses out of joint among stars who haven’t been asked, especially those who think they are bigger names than those who have.

'Unfortunately things have got a bit nasty between some. At first it was just going to be the finalists from each series, but once exceptions started being made it really sparked anger and resentment.'

Among the former contestants expected to take part in the special are 2018 breakout stars and exes Megan Barton Hanson and Wes Nelson, and last year's runner-ups Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury.

Meanwhile, Montana Brown, who narrowly missed out on the finale in 2017 after she was dumped from the Mallorca villa with her then-beau Alex Beattie, is said to be included in the line-up of returning stars.

A source said: 'It’s just not possible to have everyone on in three episodes – so unfortunately the reality is some people have had to miss out. 

'A few of them have kicked off a bit about it, but that’s just life. They can squabble among themselves all they want.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Love Island for comment. 

Rules: Despite initial reported rules that only the top four from each series would be featured, Montana Brown − who narrowly missed out on the 2017 final − is said to have been included
