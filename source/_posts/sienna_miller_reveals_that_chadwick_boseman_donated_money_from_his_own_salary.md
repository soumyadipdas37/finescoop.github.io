Sienna Miller has revealed that Chadwick Boseman donated money from his own salary to boost her pay on 21 Bridges and said it was what she 'deserved to be paid'. 

The Black Panther actor, who tragically died from colon cancer aged 43 in August, supplemented the star's pay cheque after her figure was turned down by the studio.

Sienna, 38, who shares daughter Marlowe, eight, with former partner Tom Sturridge, told how she was 'hesitant' to return to filming but was keen to work with Chadwick.

Speaking to Empire, she said: 'This was a pretty big budget film, and I know that everybody understands about the pay disparity in Hollywood, but I asked for a number that the studio wouldn't get to.

'And because I was hesitant to go back to work and my daughter was starting school and it was an inconvenient time, I said: "I'll do it if I'm compensated in the right way."'

She added: 'And Chadwick ended up donating some of his salary to get me to the number that I had asked for. He said that that was what I deserved to be paid.'

The American Sniper actress described how the gesture was a 'testament' to Chadwick's character and explained how there was 'no showiness' to the offer.

Chadwick, who was a producer on 21 Bridges, approached Sienna to star in the film and told her he was a 'fan' of her work which she said was 'reciprocated, tenfold'. 

However Sienna revealed how she had been 'working non-stop' and was 'exhausted'. after starring in films such as American Woman and The Catcher Was a Spy. 

'Astounding': The Edge of Love actress described the gesture as 'the most astounding thing' and told how she could not 'imagine' another man 'in that town' 'behaving that graciously or respectfully

The British-American actress later requested a 'number' which was turned down by the film bosses prompting Chadwick to step in to get Sienna on-board. 

The Edge of Love star described the gesture as 'the most astounding thing' and told how she could not 'imagine' another man 'in that town' 'behaving that graciously or respectfully'. 

In the action movie Chadwick stars as the embattled NYPD detective, Andre Davis, who joins a citywide manhunt for two cop killers.

As the night unfolds, he uncovers a massive conspiracy that links his fellow police officers to a criminal empire and he becomes unsure of who to pursue and who's after him.

When the search intensifies, authorities take the extreme measure of closing all of Manhattan's 21 bridges to prevent the suspects from escaping.

Sienna plays Frankie Burns - a detective working with Andre while Taylor Kitsch, who plays Ray Jackson, and Stephan James, who stars as Michael Trujillo, are the two suspects on the run. 

After Chadwick's death last month, his family said in a heartbreaking statement: 'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman.
