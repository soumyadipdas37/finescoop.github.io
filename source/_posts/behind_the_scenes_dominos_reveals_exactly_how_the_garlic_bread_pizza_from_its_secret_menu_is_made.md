Domino's Australia has offered diners a glimpse inside the kitchen showing exactly how the garlic bread pizza from its secret menu was made.

Earlier this year, the pizza giant unveiled the unique mash up of a classic crust base, topped with chunks of garlic, cheese, garlic butter and fresh spring onions.

And now, the fast food chain has shared a simple step-by-step TikTok video showing an employee creating the secret menu pizza oozing with cheese.

'It all started when my mum [garlic bread] met my dad [pizza] and they fell in love and they had me,' a male voice can be heard saying in the footage.

To create the pizza, the employee spread tomato paste on the dough to create the classic crust base before adding six chunky slices of garlic bread.

Next, she stopped it with a generous amount of mozzarella cheese before she drizzled garlic butter all over.

Once its cooked in the oven, she removed the pizza from the pan and sprinkled green onion on top.

The video has since been viewed more than 23,000 times, with dozens of people describing it as a 'slice of heaven'.

'I need this in my life... wow,' one said, while another added: 'That looks amazing.' 

The $7.95 creation is no longer available to purchase after it was sold for one week only - but many called on the pizza chain to bring it back to its secret menu.

The pizza was created by the Domino's chief garlic bread taste tester Zach Gracie.

'I spent hours experimenting in the Domino's development kitchen, dreaming up all sorts of pizza and garlic bread innovations,' he said. 

'I remember thinking "I know it sounds crazy... but what if I combine garlic bread and pizza?" So I did, and it was beautiful.

'I think that was one of my proudest moments as Domino's chief garlic bread taste tester, and I'm so excited that others can finally try my creation.'

A Domino's spokesperson previously described the pizza as a 'delicious carb-on-carb creation worth breaking those New Year's resolutions for'.
