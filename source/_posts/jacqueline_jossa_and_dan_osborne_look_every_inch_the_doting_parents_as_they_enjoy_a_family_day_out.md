Jacqueline Jossa and Dan Osborne headed on a fun family day out at Marsh Farm Animal Adventure Park in Chelmsford on Tuesday.

The I'm A Celebrity winner, 27, and Dan, 29, looked every inch the doting parents as they explored with their daughters Ella, five, and Mia, two, and Dan's son Teddy, six.

Jacqueline cut a casual figure in a black slogan T-shirt, joggers and biker boots.

Their family trip to the farm came after Jacqueline told her 2.9 million Instagram followers that she was feeling 'pretty rough' on Thursday.

She reassured them that it wasn't coronavirus, as she said: 'I've come over unwell. Not corona, sick. So I'm just in bed trying to recover.'

Jacqueline and Dan have just returned from a sun-soaked holiday in Greece and seem to be happier than ever. 

The couple have had their share of ups and downs with allegations of cheating on Dan's part since they married in 2017. 

Dan later admitted he had been unfaithful to Jacqueline and that she had forgiven him for his past indiscretions.  

The reality star also hit out at trolls who criticised his marriage in a foul-mouthed rant after a fan questioned why Jacqueline stays with him.

'Any more reasons you need? You didn't know none of that, eh? That's because you do not f***ing know me, or my wife, or us as a couple lol.

'So concentrate on your own life and you (sic) clearly never been taught to not be rude, especially to people you don't even know. Hope you've learnt something from this.'

The response stemmed from a post Jacqueline shared the previous day of herself and husband Dan, urging him to 'hurry home please' amid his Turkey trip.
