Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has admitted he considered leaving Arsenal this summer but the chance to improve under manager Mikel Arteta was a 'key factor' in his decision to commit his future to the club.

Barcelona tried to lure the 31-year-old to the Nou Camp before the Gunners confirmed their captain had signed a new three-year deal worth £350,000-a-week after months of speculation over his future.

Aubameyang helped Arsenal win the FA Cup final and the Community Shield at Wembley - scoring in both games - and netted in his side's opening Premier League win over Fulham. 

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has admitted he considered leaving Arsenal this summer

'Two things persuaded me to stay,' he told Sky Sports. 'The first thing was Mikel Arteta, because since he came in he brings a lot of positivity and a new philosophy for us.

'I think that was important because it matched my game and I feel that I can improve with him. I think this was the key factor and as well, the love that I receive from the fans and the whole club.

'Everyone is treating me very, very good, so I feel at home and that's why I'm staying.

'We had a chat during lockdown and we were supposed to talk about a game and he said 'okay, forget about it, we're going to talk about the future' and he asked me what I wanted to do.

'I was like 'I feel good since you came, I'm improving, and the philosophy is very, very nice so I just want to stay' and he was like 'I'm sure if you stay you can leave a legacy, but it's all about you and what you want. Of course you can leave and go for trophies in big clubs as well but I think you can create a legacy here in this great club.'

'This was the key message to me and after that conversation I was like 'okay, it's all clear for me and I just want to stay' and that's it.'
