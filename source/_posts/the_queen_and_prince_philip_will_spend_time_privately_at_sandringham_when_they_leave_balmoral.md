The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will spend time privately at Sandringham when they leave Balmoral next week, Buckingham Palace announced today. 

The Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, arrived at Balmoral, in Aberdeenshire, at the start of August and have enjoyed visits from family in the weeks since. 

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have spent time on the estate, as have Princess Anne and Prince Andrew. 

It was previously understood the Queen and Prince Philip would return to Windsor Castle rather than Sandringham.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will depart Balmoral Castle during the week commencing September 14 to spend time privately on the Sandringham Estate.

'These plans will be kept under review and will of course be subject to all relevant guidance and advice.'
