PC Andrew Harper's widow was praised by This Morning viewers after she appeared on the show today. 

Lissie Harper, 29, admitted her husband's 2019 death still feels 'surreal' but that she refuses to 'crumble'. She also spoke of her campaign for a change in law to bring about harsher sentences for people convicted of killing frontline emergency services workers.  

Viewers were moved by Lissie's devotion to her husband and by her fight for his legacy. 

Lissie, from 29, has been campaigning to change the law after her childhood sweetheart PC Andrew Harper was killed in the line of duty just four weeks after their wedding in 2019

Loose Women viewers were moved by the widow's determination to make her late husband proud

'I kind of have two choices,' she said, 'either I sit and crumble or I keep going and I do something he'd be proud of,' she said. The "surrealness" of it still hasn't gone.

'At the beginning it was heartbreaking and it still is everyday but you just got to deal with it,' she added. 

She said fighting to introduce Harper Law has helped her cope with the loss of her husband.

'Grief is just something that you can never expect how to deal with and there is no correct way to deal with it,' she said. 

'I think finding something that you can do for the person that you've lost is immeasurably important and it certainly helped me to get me that kind of focus and I know i'm doing something that would make him proud. '

Speaking of her grief, the widow admitted she needed to learn she could not do everything and to balance things out more in her life. 

'This is part of my journey and it is important to deal with that grief, but perhaps for me that's how I'm dealing with it,' she said.

PC Andrew Harper was killed in August 2019 after his ankle got caught in the trailing tow rope of three thieves' getaway car. They drag him to his death for a mile of country roads in Berkshire

On her campaign for stronger sentences for those who've killed emergency workers, which saw her write to the Prime Minister meet with the Home Secretary Priti Patel,  Lissie said everything was 'moving along really well.'

She added she had also received cross-party support from the Shadow cabinet.  

'We're trying to explain to people why it's important and gather as much support as we can and the general public have responded to that,' she said. 

She added she was not surprised that her plea to change the law had struck such a chord with the British public.

'I'm not surprised, it's been a long time coming that people have been thinking our justice system is not working,' she said. 

She shared that that fact that the convicted killers of her husband had applied for appeal had added to the number of things she already was trying to deal with. 





Viewers felt for Lissie and praised her determination to put Harper's Law into action after her appearance on the show

'So many people can relate to the feeling of injustice,' she added. 

Viewers were moved by Lissie's determination to make her late husband proud and her fight to change the law. 

'What an incredibly brave and courageous woman,' one wrote. 'This should be the happiest time of her life instead she's having to devote her time to ensuring no family endures what she has had to.. Wish you nothing but love and best wishes,' they added. 

'Lissie on Loose Women about Harper Law. What a beautiful brave person. Andrew be so proud,' said another.  

'Such a beautiful brave lady is Lissie god bless her,' one said.

'Harper Law needs to happen quickly. It's absolutely abhorrent that his widow will now have to suffer the convicted criminals going to appeal,' said another.   

Lissie and her 28-year-old husband had been married for just four weeks when he and a Thames Valley Police colleague responded to a late-night burglary in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, in August last year.

The brave police officer was killed by a gang of three teenagers in a speeding getaway car, who dragged him for more than a mile on country roads after his ankle became caught in its trailing tow rope in Berkshire.

The Attorney General referred the sentences of PC Andrew Harper's three killers to the Court of Appeal in August amid concerns they were too low.

Lissie said she either could sit and 'crumble' or keep doing something she knew would make Andrew proud 

Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, have already lodged applications with the same court to challenge their manslaughter convictions and 13-year jail sentences.

They were jailed on July 31 alongside Henry Long, 19, who received 16 years in prison, for killing the Thames Valley Police officer. 

The three killers, who showed no remorse after dragging PC Harper to his death, will be eligible for parole in a few years.

Lissie Harper is challenging their sentences in a sentencing review hearing at the end of October as she wants to see the sentences increased.

On 2 September, Lissie met with Secretary of State Priti Patel after launching her Harper's Law campaign.

The campaign would ensure a minimum life sentence for criminals convicted of killing an emergency services worker.
