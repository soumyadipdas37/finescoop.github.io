Gordon Ramsay and his wife Tana enjoyed a speed boat ride around the coast of Cornwall on Monday.

The couple had headed to their £4.4million holiday home for the Bank Holiday weekend with three of their five children - Jack, 20, Matilda, 18, and Oscar, 15 months.

Gordon, 53, took to Instagram to document the fun boat trip as he and Tana, 46, took time off parenting duties to head out on an adrenaline-fuelled adventure.

It comes as Gordon has been enjoying the fruits of his renovations at his £4.4million Cornish home over the weekend, showing off the breathtaking views from the pool he's had installed at the house. 

'Now that is what I call an August bank holiday, look at that, beautiful,' he captioned the video, as the family spent the long weekend at their beach retreat. 

Starting the video with a shot of the pool's water with the caption 'wow', Gordon panned the camera up to show off the landscaped garden which led down to the beach.

Cute: Gordon was every inch the doting dad as he gave his youngest son Oscar, 15 months, who sported a top-knot, swimming lessons in his breathtaking pool in Rock on Monday

'Porthilly beach which has some of the most delicious oysters and mussels anywhere in the world,' he narrated. 

'Simply stunning. How could you not love Cornwall?' he gushed, taking in the blue skies.  

In an Instagram snap, Gordon smiled as he held his adorable son Oscar  in the stunning pool overlooking Porthilly Cove.  

The father-of-five opted for a black short-sleeved t-shirt and shorts as he cradled the toddler in the turquoise water and his spaniel in the other hand. 

Captioning the pictures to Instagram, Gordon wrote: 'Swimming lessons Done ! @oscarjramsay.' 

Relaxed: The fiery chef appeared to embrace the bank holiday as he scooped Oscar out of the water
