Nicole wore a metallic silver swimsuit which sculpted her hourglass figure as she relaxed in the icy water at Remedy Place in California. 

The songstress pinned her brunette locks into a sleek topknot and went without a scrap of makeup for the treatment which claims to 'increase endorphins'. 

She posted a video of herself in the tub to her Instagram, captioned: 'Whatchu know about that 3°C ice bath...'

The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.

A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies.  

'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.

'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'

Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives at the time, who are yet to comment.
