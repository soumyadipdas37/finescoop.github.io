If you have a spare bedroom that rarely gets used, you might have considered turning it into a dressing room.

And when one couple were quoted more than £1,000 by IKEA to turn the room into an amazing walk-in wardrobe, they decided to do it themselves.

Hari Harris, 25, a father-of-one and retail manager from Shropshire, had a spare room in his home that he was keen to turn into a space for his clothes.

After seeing the expensive price from IKEA, Hari and his partner Jamie decided to undertake the project themselves using DIY kits from B&Q.

They created the walk-in wardrobe of their dreams for less than £370, saving hundreds of pounds as a result.

Hari told money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk: 'We had recently renovated our home and after the main jobs were done, we moved onto the bedroom.

'After discussing ideas, we decided to remove the wardrobe in the bedroom and use the unused guest bedroom as a wardrobe.

Dunelm canvas boxes x 3: £8

The Range and B&Q accessories: £50 

'We looked at many ideas and designs, and even had an online quote done from IKEA which came in way over £1,000 so we looked for the next alternatives but were set on having an open wardrobe.

'By chance, we went shopping in B&Q for some paint and came across the form dressing kit.

'We purchased two form pole and satelit matt white dressing kits at £110 each and two form pole matt white wardrobe dressing kits at £45 each. We then purchased the canvas boxes from Dunelm for three for £8.

'It was all flat pack and took us roughly two hours to build. It was a DIY pack so we just followed the instructions.

'They're secured to the walls and floors with the L brackets provided. There are so many different designs and they can all be cut down to fit!'

Hari said the trip to B&Q was worth it because of the money he and Jamie saved whilst ending up with a very similar outcome to what it would have looked like from IKEA. 

'I also spent £50 on accessories for the room from The Range and B&Q,' he added.

They ended up with their wonderful walk-in wardrobe which houses all of their clothes, shoes and accessories such as sunglasses

Hari, who shares his home transformations on Instagram at @house_number_twelve, is delighted with the transformation and found it to be an excellent distraction during the lockdown.

'During the lockdown, we managed to complete a garden makeover and a dressing room makeover,' he adds.

'It gave us something to concentrate on as well as being rewarding - after all, DIY is most rewarding when the job is complete!

'We've been renovating our home for two years and with just one room left to do it's finally coming to an end.

'My main tips would be to shop around and look because the savings can be huge.

'The B&Q kits were easy to build, and can be cut down to fit the room so any space can be transformed.'

Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, comments: 'One would normally think that IKEA would always be one of the most affordable options, but as Hari and Jamie prove, shopping around can save you huge amounts.

'By sourcing their flatpack wardrobe kits from B&Q instead of IKEA, they saved over £650 and ended up with virtually the same result: a stunning walk-in wardrobe!'

Hari added: 'It gave us something to concentrate on as well as being rewarding - after all, DIY is most rewarding when the job is complete!
