A mother-of-five was left distraught after she failed her driving test without the chance to start it.

New Zealand woman Letticia Pevy, 38, was mortified to receive an automatic fail from the examiner because the front passenger seat of her Mazda was too dirty and deemed a COVID-19 risk.

Ms Pevy insists she had cleaned the seat before the test but would have taken more care if she was aware of the consequences of not meeting the examiner's strict standards.

She was left crying in her car for 45 minutes afterwards.

'It's not immaculate but as a busy working mum of five, our family car is often last priorities,' Ms Pevy told 7news.com.au.

'Had I been informed prior on what their expectation was, obviously I would have gone to greater lengths to get it up to scratch.'

Ms Pevy, from Hamilton, took the result to heart.

'To be told your car is a health and safety hazard, I don't think I've ever been in my adult life so mortified and embarrassed,' she told Stuff.

'I was a nervous wreck a couple of nights beforehand. I had a couple of those dreams, so what if, thoughts. I actually think I had gone through every single possible scenario; having a messy vehicle didn't even occur to me.'

Ms Pevy also claimed the testing officer was not wearing personal protective equipment at the time.

Drving test organisation VTNZ intially refused to refund the $109.50 booking fee. 

However it has since apologised and allowed Ms Pevy to resit the test for her full driving licence free after the story attracted media attention.

'As we continue to move through different COVID-19 alert levels we are following strict health and safety procedures while conducting driver tests,' operations support manager James Law told Stuff.
