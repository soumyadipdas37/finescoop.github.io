Lesley-Lee Hill (pictured) allegedly blew cash donated on a GoFundMe page intended for her son's funeral on the pokies, cigarettes and clothes. Lucius Baira-Hill, 13, died in a horror car crash in Townsville on June 7

The mother of a 13-year-old boy who was killed in a horror crash alongside three other teenagers has been accused of blowing money raised for his funeral on trips to the pokies, clothing and cigarettes.

Lesley-Lee Hill's son Lucius died instantly when the allegedly stolen Kia Sorento he was a passenger in clipped a roundabout, flipped over and hit a light pole on June 7.

Well-wishers raised $7,000 on a GoFundMe page to help Lucius' family cover the costs of his funeral, but Hill, 28, allegedly blew about half the money on her own expenses in less than two weeks.

Police allege Hill was sent $3,600 from Lucius' father - who had run the fundraising page - in the days after the teenager's burial on June 22, while the funeral costs were paid for by the boy's grandmother, The Townsville Bulletin reported. 

Hill allegedly spent most of that amount on clothing, pokies and cigarettes.

Hill last month was interviewed by police and a community call-out led to more than 40 complaints from people who had given money to the fundraiser.

The mother is due to front Townsville Magistrates Court on Tuesday and police will push for her to be denied bail.

Townsville Police's Child Protection Unit officer-in-charge Detective Senior Sergeant Dave Miles said the alleged profiteering was difficult to fathom.   

'To have an individual [allegedly] seek to profit from their own child’s death is hard to put into words,' he said. 

Hill was previously granted a bail variation after she was released from custody on one count of unlawful use of a motor vehicle.

Her bail was changed to allow her to leave home to attend counselling sessions without her mother.

The car (pictured) clipped a roundabout before slamming into a light pole at around 4.30am on June 7 

Cayenne Nona, 14, Rayveena Coolwell, 15, and Aaliyah Tappa Brown, 17, also died in the crash. 

Pictures from the scene showed a badly-wrecked white Kia Sorrento upside-down at the intersection.  

The 14-year-old alleged driver was charged with a string of offences, including dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death, two counts of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, burglary and possessing dangerous drugs.
