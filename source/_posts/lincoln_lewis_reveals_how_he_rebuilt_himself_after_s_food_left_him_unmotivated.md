He showed off his impressive physique on the cover of Men's Health after shedding an impressive 12kg in 12 weeks last year.

And Lincoln Lewis, 32, has now discussed using diet and exercise to 'rebuild himself as a person' after vices such as chocolate and crisps left him 'unmotivated, undisciplined and unhappy'.

The former Home and Away star explained to Yahoo Australia that a lull in his acting career and mental health problems forced him to rely on 'sh**** foods' before a 'life-changing experience flipped him out of his mindset'. 

'Sh** food!' Lincoln Lewis, 32, has discussed using diet and exercise to 'rebuild himself as a person' after vices such as chocolate and crisps left him 'unmotivated, undisciplined and unhappy'

'The last couple of years when things haven't been the best, when motivation is lacking sometimes you look for a pick me up, and for me it would always be sh**** food like chocolate or chips,' Lincoln reflected.

After a lengthy period neglecting his health, the TV star had a chance meeting with the editor of Men's Health, Scott Henderson.

'I remember talking [to Scott] about inspiring, fit people like Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Hardy who all happen to be former Men's Health cover stars. Then Scott said, "We'll get you on the cover, mate."'

'I strongly believe that meeting Scott was a complete life-changing experience. It was the motivation I needed to flip me out of my mindset,' he added.

Sure enough Scott's encouraging words were just the kickstart Lincoln - who played Geoff Campbell on Home and Away - needed to focus on his health and fitness.

With the help of personal trainer, Jono Castano - who is the man behind Rebel Wilson's impressive slimdown - Lincoln began his jaw-dropping transformation.

Jono also opened Lincoln's eyes to the world of organic foods, and it wasn't long before he began chowing down on fresh and healthy produce himself.

Lincoln has been passionately encouraging and advocating the benefits of organic produce since June when he was announced he was ambassador for this year's Australian Organic Awareness Month campaign.

Earlier this month, Lincoln revealed that overhauling his diet and exercise regimen helped pull him out the depths of his depression.
