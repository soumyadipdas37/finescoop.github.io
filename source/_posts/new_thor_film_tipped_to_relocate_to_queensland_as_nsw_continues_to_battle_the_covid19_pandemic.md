Speaking to Poland's Elle Man this month, Chris confirmed he won't be retiring his famous character after Thor: Love and Thunder.

Is this his last Thor film? Hollywood actor Chris, has set the record straight on rumours he is leaving the Marvel superhero role 

'Are you crazy?! I'm not going into any retirement period,' he said.

'Thor is far too young for that. He's only 1,500 years old. It's definitely not a film that I say goodbye to. At least I hope so.'

The movie, the fourth in the action franchise, reunites Chris with Tessa Thompson and Natalie, and also features Christian Bale.
