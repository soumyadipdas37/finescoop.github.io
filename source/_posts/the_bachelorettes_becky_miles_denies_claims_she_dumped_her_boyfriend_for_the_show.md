The Bachelorette's Becky Miles has denied claims she dumped her ex-boyfriend to appear on the Channel Ten dating show.

The 30-year-old suitress told Woman's Day, she wasn't in a relationship but had been casually dating some before filming the show.

'I wasn't in a relationship when I signed on to this, I can tell you that! I was casually dating someone before the show, which was for a short amount of time,' she said.

'When I told him about this opportunity I tried to be honest as possible and we left on a good note,' she added.

Becky went on to say she had been in a relationship last year but was heartbroken when she found out he 'was mucking around'.

'I fell in love with this guy two months before I was leaving for a holiday. He flew over and came to see us at the end of our travels and we spent about a month together.'

'But when we came home, a month or two afterwards I found out through friends he was mucking around on me,' she said.

Last month, radio host Ed Kavalee claimed Becky had been in a relationship but she ended it so she could appear on the show.

'The person that she was with found out she was doing this show from the press,' he said on the Hughesy and Ed show.

His co-host Dave Hughes asked: 'He thought he was in a relationship with the older sister and he's found out that he's no longer in a relationship with her when he saw the press release that she was on The Bachelorette?'

'Yes,' Ed said before claiming he was told by 'people deep in reality TV'. 

'Elly got in first. It's then been brought up, "What about the sister? Let's try." So then behind the scenes, she [Becky] gets across the line and then goes [to her boyfriend], "You're out!"'
