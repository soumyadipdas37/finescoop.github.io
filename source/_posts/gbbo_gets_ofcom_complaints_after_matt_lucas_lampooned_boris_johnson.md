The Great British Bake Off has received 202 complaints after Matt Lucas lampooned Boris Johnson on the show as it returned for its 11th season on Tuesday night.

Making his show debut, co-host Matt Lucas impersonated a bumbling Boris Johnson as he recreated a spoof press conference with the slogan 'Stay Alert, Protect Cake, Save Loaves'. 

An Ofcom spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'

The comedian, 46, who has replaced Sandi Toksvig as host, was a spitting image of the Prime Minister in the show opener, which was postponed by 15 minutes, after Boris addressed the nation with the new lockdown measures in the fight against coronavirus.

In the skit Matt, who donned a platinum blond wig and stood in front of a Union Jack flag, said: 'I've talked about this, you know, the printer is upside down again. And oh no.. well… how? Ah, yes well that works actually, I can read that fine.

'Um, right, let's err… yeah. Good evening, let's get straight to it. We are now approaching Phase 46. 

'Which means that from Tuesday morning, or Wednesday evening depending on your height. We are, we are, we are saying with regards to baking if you must bake in a tent, bake in a tent.

'But please don't bake in a tent. And we are asking people to use common sense with regards to the distribution of hundreds and thousands.'

Matt then said he was going to take a question from 'the lady in the funky dress, Noelle'.

The Little Britain's star's co-host Noel Fielding then said: 'Hello Prime Minister. Just one question: 'Is it sc-oh-ne or sc-on?'.

Matt said he was going to hand over the query to the 'experts'- a spoof of Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance- Prue Whitty (Prue Leith) and Professor Paul Hollywood. 

After Prue and Paul gave alternate answers, Matt said: Right well I hope that clears things up for you,' before he ripped off his wig to say: 'All that remains is for me to say…. Welcome to The Great British Bake Off'. 

Viewers soon flooded Twitter to laud Matt on the ingenious spoof.

Spoof: In reference to the work from home message he said, ''We are, we are, we are saying with regards to baking if you must bake in a tent, bake in a tent. But please don't bake in a tent'

One fan of the show wrote: 'I'm loving Matt Lucas on Bake Off already', while another added: 'Sensational. #mattlucas #boris #BakeOff'.

A third chimed: 'Matt Lucas is already a fabulous addition to #GBBO'.

A fourth viewer gushed: 'Matt Lucas makes a better Boris Johnson than Boris Johnson does.'  

'Matt Lucas being Boris is just what I needed #smile', typed a different fan.

Another said: 'no context bake off back with a bang'. 

Funny: Matt then said he was going to take a question from 'the lady in the funky dress, Noelle', aka his co-host Noel Fielding 

Pressing matters: The Little Britain's star's co-host said: 'Hello Prime Minister. Just one question: 'Is it sc-oh-ne or sc-on?'

Experts: Matt said he was going to hand over the query to the 'experts'- a spoof of Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance- Prue Whitty (Prue Leith) and Professor Paul Hollywood

This isn't the first time Matt has taken aim at Boris with a bumbling impersonation. 

Back in May, he summed up the confusion over the Prime Minister's speech in a mocking 20-second video. 

Baffled members of the public had poked fun at Boris and his Government after he ditched the 'stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives' slogan, instead urging people to 'stay alert, control the virus, and save lives'.

He also unveiled a three stage exit plan and a five stage alert system to describe the country's outbreak condition.

But the new measures, and tweaks to the draconian lockdown rules - which includef being able to leave the house for exercise as often as you want - left people feeling decidedly confused. 







'Sensational': Viewers soon flooded Twitter to laud Matt on the ingenious spoof

Little Britain star Matt summed up the mood of the nation with a hilarious impersonation of the Prime Minister. 

In a YouTube video he said: 'So we are saying don't go to work, go to work, don't take public transport, don't go to work. Stay indoors, if you can work from home go to work, don't go to work.

'Go outside, don't go outside. And then we will or won't something or other.' 

Piers Morgan played the clip on Good Morning Britain this morning and said it was 'very, very funny' but that the confusion from Mr Johnson's speech would lead to more deaths.
