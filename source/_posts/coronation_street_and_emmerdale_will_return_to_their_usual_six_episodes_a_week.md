ITV has confirmed Coronation Street will return to six episodes a week this month.

Set to start on September 14, the soap will resume its usual schedule, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to reduce broadcasts before running out of episodes altogether.

The soap had to cease filming its episodes while cast and crew were sent into lockdown, with the rest of the country.

Six six six! ITV has confirmed Coronation Street will return to six episodes a week this month

This welcome return comes as the show approaches its 60th anniversary.

There is a slight change to the way episodes will be aired. Double bill episodes will air on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

And ITV has promised that the coming months will see the drama amplify ahead of the 60 year celebrations on December 9th.

A series of explosive storylines will see David and Shona fighting to rekindle their lost love, Daniel’s confused emotional connection to sex worker Nicky deepen, an epic feud between Abi and Debbie begins, while Peter’s involvement in Abi’s dark past will bring trouble to his own door with Carla.

Leanne will take on the world as she fights to save her son Oliver, however a face from Nick’s past threatens his future when Natasha Blakeman returns to Weatherfield.

Natasha isn’t the only face returning to Coronation Street, Todd Grimshaw’s return spells more heartache for Eileen and plants a bomb under Billy and Paul. But it’s not all heartache for Eileen when a new arrival puts a spring in her step!

Producer Iain MacLeod said: 'The amount of work that has gone into keeping Coronation Street on the air, and getting it back to six episodes a week, has been staggering.

'I am so proud of the tireless efforts of everyone behind the scenes and onscreen. 

'We have been energised and motivated by the nearly 60 years of heritage behind the show, and the massively important place it still holds in the Nation’s hearts.

'Throughout lockdown and beyond, the regular instalments of Britain’s best-loved soap have taken on even greater significance, giving viewers a beacon of familiarity and normality amid the craziest of times.

'It is often said that our characters are like members of the viewers’ extended families.

'And at a time when many people couldn’t see their loved ones in real life, their fictional friends on the cobbles became even more essential, as the audience escaped in half-hour bursts into the wonderful world of Weatherfield.'
