Calls are growing for Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to step down after the abrupt resignation of his health minister Jenny Mikakos.

Ms Mikakos posted a letter on Twitter on Saturday announcing that she is quitting as both a minister and member of parliament, after more than 21 years in office.

Her resignation came just a day after Mr Andrews pointed the finger at her when he was asked who was to blame for the hotel quarantine bungle that led to the second wave of COVID-19 cases.  

But state opposition Liberal Party MPs have hit out the Premier, saying he 'threw Ms Mikakos under the bus' to absolve himself of blame - but that he too 'needs to go'.

Premier Andrews told the inquiry into the quarantine blunder that he regarded Ms Mikakos as being 'accountable for the program'. 

Moments after her resignation, Victorian Shadow Health Minister Georgie Crozier took to social media to blast Mr Andrew's leadership. 

'A fish rots from the head down... he can't think by Mikakos going all is fine. It is not. He needs to go too,' she posted.

Ms Crozier later told Sky News the premier was simply looking for 'a scalp' to make him look good.  

'She's gone now but only on Thursday Daniel Andrews was backing her and said he had confidence in her,' she said.

'He has lied, he has actually made so many cover-ups, or said so many cover-ups, in relation to this whole dreadful situation.

Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett also joined the chorus of voices on Twitter

'We had in this inquiry, 10 senior bureaucrats that couldn't tell us who appointed the security guards in the hotel quarantine program. Three ministers, including Minister Mikakos and the premier, none of them knew.'    

Following the resignation of Mikakos, #DanAndrewsResign was trending on Twitter and and there was not shortage of Liberal Party members lining up to put the boot in. 

Opposition leader Michael O'Brien said: 'Mikakos should go because of contact tracing failures and her dodgy evidence to the Inquiry, but Mikakos did not say 'no' to ADF.'

'She did not bring in private security for hotel quarantine. These decisions caused our second wave. Andrews is responsible. He must go.'

Pressure on Ms Mikakos mounted after her testimony to the inquiry on Thursday was conflicted by Mr Andrews' on Friday.

Ms Mikakos told the hearing that 'to the best of her recollection' she did not know private guards were enforcing the scheme until late May when the Rydges hotel suffered a coronavirus outbreak.

But a video of a press conference on 29 March - two days after the quarantine scheme was announced - shows Ms Mikakos standing alongside jobs minister Martin Pakula as he said: 'Passengers returning will now undergo mandatory two-week quarantine at those Melbourne hotels with security guards in place.' 

Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett accused Mr Andrews of hanging on of his team out to dry.  

'When a leader stops protecting his own, let alone blames them for mistakes of the whole, it is time the leader fails all tests if leadership and should resign. Today,' he posted. 

Firebrand shadow housing minister Tim Smith stated the decision to opt for ill-trained private security guards in favour of the military personnel being offered up by the federal government, falls at the feet of the Premier. 

Two men were detained on Saturday for protesting against the lockdown restrictions in place in Victoria

'Mikakos has gone. Good. But the Premier and no other Minister has accepted responsibility for the decision to use private security instead of the ADF and police,' Mr Smith said.

'Andrews has not explained why he thanked the PM for the offer of ADF support on March 28th but didn't use them.'

Victoria's Health Workers Union also welcomed Mikakos's resignation, but stopped short of calling for Andrew's blood too.

'We hope to engage with a new Health Minister to put a stop to the bizarre decisions to contract out public hospital cleaners and other non-clinical workers during a pandemic and replace them from dodgy outsourcing firms,' the organisation posted to Twitter.
