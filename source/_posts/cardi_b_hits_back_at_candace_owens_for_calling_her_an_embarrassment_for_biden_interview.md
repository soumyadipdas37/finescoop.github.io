Cardi B and Candace Owens engaged in a series of harsh exchanges on social media on Sunday after the conservative commentator called the Grammy-winning rapper ‘illiterate’ and an ‘embarrassment’ to black people.

The feud began on Sunday evening when Owens, 31, shared a clip of her appearance on The Ben Shapiro Show, in which she said slammed Democratic nominee Joe Biden for taking part in an interview with Cardi B - real name Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar – for Elle last month.

Owens said it was ‘one of the biggest insults’ to black voters that Biden decided to do the interview with an ‘illiterate rapper’, rather than someone who could ask the ‘tough questions’.

The Republican went on to say that the former Vice President thinks ‘black people are stupid’ and likened his interview with Cardi B to Donald Trump being interviewed by Justin Bieber.

Since most black people didn’t have the spine to admit that @benshapiro was 100% correct about @iamcardib and how her music and platform contributes to the disintegration of black culture and values...here you go. #WAP #SundaySpecial pic.twitter.com/q5QxxX9G4e

Cardi, 27, caught wind of Owens’ comments and hit back at her in a video on Instagram, in which she insisted Biden decided to sit down with her because of her wide-ranging influence.

‘It's not a secret I use my platform to encourage people to vote,’ Cardi, who previously endorsed Bernie Sanders said during the video. 

‘I have millions of followers. I pay millions in taxes. I have the Number One song in this country, I have the Number One song in the United Kingdom, I have the Number One song in Australia, I have the Number One song in New Zealand.

‘Just like I can make millions of people pop their p****y,’ she said of her hit-single WAP, ‘I can make millions of people go out and vote.’

Cardi went on to condemn Owens for being a ‘cheerleader’ for Trump, and slamming the pundit for ‘getting pimped out by white men.’

‘I don’t know what Black man broke your heart … that you hate your kind so much,’ Cardi said. 'I honestly just feel sorry for you,' she said in a separate message.

In the caption to the video, Cardi B wrote: ‘@realcandaceowens here I hope these followers that you wanted from me sooo bad make you happy ...Now leave me alone....love yourself that one thing for me !’

Owens later responded with an Instagram video of her own, in which she claimed that Cardi is ‘hurting black America’.

‘You continually keep saying you have a Number One song—it means s***," Owens said. ‘Nobody cares about a song about your 'Wet A** P****'. That has nothing to do with Black America, and whether you're helping or hurting. Right now, you're hurting Black America.’

Cardi, 27, caught wind of Owens’ comments and hit back at her in a video on Instagram, in which she insisted Biden decided to sit down with her because of her wide-ranging influence. Owens later responded with an Instagram video of her own, in which she claimed that Cardi is ‘hurting black America’.

The 31-year-old then suggested to Cardi B that statistically, her husband, Offset, is more likely to kill her than a police officer.

The back-and-forth also spilled out onto Twitter and continued into Monday morning.

Owens accused Cardi of encouraging million to ‘go vote for the man that locked up entire generations of black men.’

‘Maybe go google: JOE BIDEN AND 1994 CRIME BILL,’ she suggested, before adding, ‘Joe Biden used you. Bernie Sanders used you. Neither one of them like or know your music. They think you’re dumb.’

The hitmaker responded by insisting that Owens, meanwhile, is ‘encouraging millions to vote for a man who laugh Everytime a black men [sic] gets killed by a cop and tell millions of Americans to drink bleach,’ an apparent allusion to when the president asked that the White House coronavirus task force investigate whether a disinfectant could be injected as a treatment for coronavirus back in April.

‘Trump didn’t even have you talking at the Republican convention,’ Cardi continued. ‘He thinks you’re dumb. MASA did you dirty but you mad at me?’

Cardi also referenced her sister Hennessy Carolina and her sister’s girlfriend getting into a verbal altercation with what she called ‘racist MAGA supporters; during a recent beach trip to the Hamptons as an example of the lingering prevalence of racism in the US.

Parodying her hit-single, Cardi also tweeted Owens, who is six months pregnant, writing: ‘Your baby singing wap wap wap this some dry ass p****’.

Owens rebutted the comment, writing: ‘Attacking an unborn child. How very DEMOCRAT of you.

‘While I have you—did you know your party has supported the slaughter of over 18 million black babies since 1973? Did you know the most unsafe place for a black child is in its mother’s womb because of YOUR party?’ she continued.

While the pair ceased messaging one another directly, each continued to speak about the feud a number of tweets and interactions with their followers on Monday.

In one such post, Owens slammed Cardi B for what she perceived to be hypocrisy over the rapper’s calls to defund the police and critique of the US generally.

‘Never listen to a person that has private security but wants the public police defunded. Never listen to a multimillionaire that made it here in America, but trashes our country,’ she tweeted Monday. ‘These Hollywood idols are frauds, leading sheep down paths they never took when they discovered success.’

Cardi B has not yet directly referenced Owen’s latest tweet. She did however retweet a message of support from New York Congressional candidate Ritchie Torres, who wrote: ‘Thank you Cardi B for exposing [Candace Owens] for the fraud that she is. You make the Bronx proud.’

Cardi B is currently at number one on the music charts in multiple countries with her controversial single WAP, which features Megan Thee Stallion.

During her in-depth chat with Joe Biden last month, the rapper questioned the Presidential hopeful on policy issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, police brutality, college affordability, and healthcare.

‘I have a whole list of things that I want our next president to do for us,’ she told Biden. ‘But first, I just want Trump out.’
