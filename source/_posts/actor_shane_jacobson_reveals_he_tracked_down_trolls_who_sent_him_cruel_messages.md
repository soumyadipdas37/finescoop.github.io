Shane Jacobson has 'tracked down trolls' who sent him cruel messages after he appeared in a COVID-19 ad campaign encouraging people to wear face masks.

Speaking to the Herald Sun on Friday, the 50-year-old actor said he contacted all the individuals who sent him hurtful messages and addressed their comments.

'There were a few people that have taken a swing and I've tracked them down. I tracked down one troll and spent 15 minutes on the phone with him. In the end, I got an unreserved apology,' he said.

The actor went on to say he is fighting 'vile attacks, abuse, and threats' made against him on social media.

'A lot of people in there don't mean any harm and 95 per cent of the water is good,' he said.

He added: 'But there are people p***ing in that pool called social media, and some of them are trying to drag you under.'
