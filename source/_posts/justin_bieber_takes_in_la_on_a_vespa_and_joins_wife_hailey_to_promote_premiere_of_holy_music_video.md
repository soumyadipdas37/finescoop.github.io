The album became Bieber's seventh number one, making him the youngest to accomplish the time at 25-years-old. The record was previously held by Elvis Presley at age 26. 

Changes spawned his Billboard Hot 100 number two, Yummy, and he was expected to tour the album from May to September with Kehlani and Jaden Smith, though dates were scheduled to 2021 due to the pandemic. 

For additional album promotion he also starred in the Justin Bieber: Seasons, 10-episode documentary series on Youtube where he discussed the pressure he had early in his career to be successful.  

Prior to his fifth studio album, he last released Purpose in 2015 and toured from 2016 until 2017 before ending tour early to focus on his mental health.  

After a very long break from music, he returned to the stage for surprise performance at Coachella during Ariana Grande's headlining set in April 2019.
