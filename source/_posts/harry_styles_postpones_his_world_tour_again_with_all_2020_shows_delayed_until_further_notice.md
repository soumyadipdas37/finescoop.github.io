Harry Styles has postponed his world tour, once again.

The singer, 26, took to Twitter on Tuesday afternoon to announce that all of his 2020 Love On Tour shows would be delayed 'until further notice' amid the COVID-19 pandemic which has swept the globe.

The former One Directioner also shared his 'hope' to play his scheduled 2021 dates, as he insisted that 'everyone's health and safety remains top priority'.

Harry tweeted: 'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice. 

'I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021 but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months.

'I can't wait to see you all on the road as soon as it's safe to do so.'

The announcement comes three months after Harry postponed the North America leg of his concert tour.

Dates: The Watermelon Sugar singer took to social media to reveal the dates that have been postponed again, three months after Harry postponed the North America leg of his tour

In June, the hitmaker was forced to reschedule the Love On Tour shows until next summer, with the run set to kick off on August 14 and wrap on October 31, 2021, due to the 'ongoing threat from Covid-19'.

During his time off the road, the singer has vowed to use his time to 'listen and educate' himself on 'how' he can 'help more in the fight for justice and equal rights', following the death of George Floyd and the global Black Lives Matter protests.
