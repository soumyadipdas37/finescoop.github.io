Kim Kardashian has made it no secret that she endures a grueling fitness routine in order to maintain her famous curves.

But the 39-year-old KKW Beauty founder had her workout session crashed by daughter North, seven, sons Saint, four, and Psalm, one, and her niece True, two, on Sunday afternoon. 

'So, this was my workout set up here, but it turned into a kids camp,' explained Kardashian who recorded the entire hilarious ordeal on her Instagram Story.

She panned over the various weights and pieces of equipment strewn about her home's massive basketball court by personal trainer Greg Miele.

North, Saint, and True were clearly drawn to an agility ladder that was laid out on the court. 

The three kids zoomed up and down the horizontal ladder, before Kim suggested that they all partake in an impromptu race. 

'Let's have a race! Let's have a race!' shouted Kim as North began expertly jumping over the various steps.

The TV personality took to her Instagram Stories to share snaps and footage from the romantic backyard celebration. 

And as she shared details from the nuptials, including a snap of herself enjoying a 'rare' cocktail', the mother-of-four posted in an image of her and 43-year-old Kanye's footwear, adding the caption: 'Date night.'

The pair's loved-up outing firmly put to bed renewed rumors that Kim was on the verge of filing for divorce from her husband of six years.

Kim didn't show her famous husband's face while sharing footage from the outdoor gathering, with only his shoes making a cameo in the social media uploads.

Throughout the night, the reality star jammed to some Frank Sinatra and indulged in a decadent gourmet meal. 

In a follow up photo, the KKW Beauty founder placed her drink on the ground and posed next to her musician-turned-designer husband Kanye.  

Last week, sources told Us Weekly that Kim was 'deeply disappointed and sad' because of her husband's ongoing mental health issues.

'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn’t healthy for Kanye,' an insider said. 

They confirmed that the producer hadn't been adhering to the care plane that he and Kim agreed on, though she 'isn't surprised' by that development and partly blames it on the ongoing pandemic.

Although she was able to overlook his erratic tweets, it was 'the mood swings and the manic episodes [that] are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'

Kanye had previously been staying isolated at his Wyoming ranch, and after taking a family vacation he's gone back to traveling on his own.
