After enduring the stress of the recent exams fiasco, one of the brightest athletics talents in the country, Amy Hunt, will take on her first significant test as a senior sprinter at the British Championships this weekend.

The 18-year-old, who holds the world Under 18 record for the 200m, revealed she was among the thousands of A-level students to have their grades downgraded by algorithm last month. 

However, she was given a reprieve by Cambridge University, where she will juggle an English degree from October with a campaign to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.

Amy Hunt, who holds the world Under 18 record for the 200m, is going to study at Cambridge

The starting point of that two-fronted challenge will come on Friday, when she contests the 100m at the British Championships behind closed doors in Manchester – her first outdoor national championships at senior level.

Hunt, who will be second quickest on paper in Manchester, is confident that her studies will not reduce her potential to reach Tokyo and then make a subsequent impact at the Games. 

She said: ‘I live my life very chaotically at times, with academia and sport, and I like to think I thrive under that pressure and embrace it. The Olympic postponement is a very good opportunity for me.

‘It allows me to feel I can potentially make the Olympics and if I do, I can be competitive there - I'm not just there to have my first experience.’

On the exams saga, she said: ‘I initially got marked down a grade but I was very lucky to get into my first choice uni. On results day, I was waiting for UCAS to update for about 50 minutes and having all these nerves as the page kept crashing. In the end it was complete euphoria.’

Meanwhile, a decision on the new head coach of UK Athletics will be made this week. Stephen Maguire is a narrow favourite for the post from Peter Eriksson.
