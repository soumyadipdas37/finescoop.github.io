Over the years humans and animals have forged an unbreakable bond, leading pet owners to do some unusual things for their furry friends. 

And it isn't just pets who make us smile, with people out and about stumbling upon sweet animals. 

An online gallery compiled by Diply shows some of the most adorable interactions between man and beast including large dogs crushing their owners as they try to sit on their laps and an extremely cuddly capybara.
