The Duchess of Cambridge wore a set of new £85 earrings from Meghan Markle's favourite brand Missoma as she joined Prince William to meet with local business people in London yesterday.

Kate Middleton, 38, made several visits throughout the east-end of the capital yesterday and spoke with local people about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their  businesses.

The mother-of-three, who has now returned to London having spent lockdown with her husband Prince William, 38, and their children, George, seven, Charlotte, six, and Louis, two, in Anmer Hall in Norfolk, selected a pair of drop earrings from London-based jewellery brand Missoma. 

The brand, which is a favourite of Kate's sister-in-law Meghan Markle's, 38, describes the earrings online as featuring 'a heart-based healing crystal that radiates love, compassion and all-around good vibes' suspended from a 'texture gold vermeil hoop.'

The mother-of-three kept her make up natural for the occasion and wore her hair in a bouncy blow dry, occasionally tucking her hair behind her ear to reveal the stunning set.

The earrings, which are for sale online for £85, are part of the company's Gemstone collection and are bejewelled with the rhodochrosite stone. 

The pyramid hoops are described as 'using the power of precious stones, placing the highest quality hand-cut stones into our specially designed and unique shapes and cuts.'  

It's not the first time the Duchess has been spotted wearing a piece by the popular brand.

The £85 earrings from Missoma are part of the brand's gemstone collection and feature a spiked hoop 

She opted for the Gold Zenyu Chandelier Hoops during her tour of Pakistan in November last year.  

Meanwhile sister-in-law Meghan has long been a fan of the brand and was first spotted wearing jewellery in a resurfaced post from her now inactive Instagram account. 

As well as Meghan Markle Missoma has countless other famous fans, ranging from model Gigi Hadid to actress Margot Robbie - who wears their coin necklaces. 

The brand was created by Marisa Hordern, who started it from her kitchen table, after sourcing gemstones from Hong Kong, Thailand, India and the US.

The brand is a favourite of Kate's sister-in-law Meghan Markle, who has worn the jewellery several times over the last few years  (pictured, wearing a bracelet from Missoma) 

In 2018, the company was named fourth on the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 list. Speaking to Harpars Bazaar in March she said about her celebrity clientele: 'It is generally good for the brand (when someone famous wears the jewellery) but we don’t really see spikes as such.

'It tends to just show how versatile the pieces are in terms of who wears it and how it can be worn. For example, Margot Robbie has been seen wearing it surfing and on the red carpet.

'It's also great to see cross-generational support like recently when Kaia Gerber and Cindy Crawford both wore it – I loved that, it reminded me of how I started the business, with my mother around the kitchen table.'   

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, both 38, appeared in high spirits as they stepped out for several engagements in London today and visited local businesses across the east-end of the city

The royals visited several businesses throughout the capital today as they met with local people to discuss the impact of the coronavirus crisis (pictured, at a job centre in London Bridge) 

The Duke and Duchess travelled to London Bridge and Whitechapel yesterday, where they celebrated the traditions of London’s East End by making Jewish bagel snacks and meeting with Muslim volunteers supporting the community during the coronavirus outbreak. 

The couple, who have not appeared together in public since July, appeared relaxed during the outing, and were said to be keen to shine a light on individuals and businesses who have gone above and beyond to help others during the pandemic. 

Kate rewore a £550 pretty red floral gown by Beulah London for the appearance in the capital, with the dress featuring a bold white collar, and paired the stunning piece with nude heels and her floral mask. 

The Duke and Duchess delighted royal fans with their visit, with local people leaning out of their apartment windows to catch a glimpse of the couple
