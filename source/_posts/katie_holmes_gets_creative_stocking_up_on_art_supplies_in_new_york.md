Katie Holmes is feeling creative. 

The actress ex of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx was pictured on Monday carrying a huge bag of art supplies as she made her way through her native New York, after stopping at the Blick art store. 

The sighting comes just days after she sparked romance rumors with  33-year-old restaurateur and chef Emilio Vitolo Jr., as the pair were spotted on a cozy dinner together in New York.

For her outing, Holmes kept things very casual in a pair of denim jeans and a plain white shirt, and was not accompanied by her rumored new man.

Meanwhile, Emilio's Ballato is a favorite of the celeb set, with fans like Whoopi Goldberg, Joe Jonas, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Bradley Cooper regularly stopping by for a bite.

Meanwhile, Holmes is notoriously private about her personal life.

The Logan Lucky actress was wed to Tom Cruise from 2006 to 2012. During that time they had daughter Suri, now 14, who is often seen accompanying mom around the Big Apple.

After that Katie began dating Jamie Foxx, who she was first linked to in 2013 when the pair was seen strolling hand in hand through Malibu.

The pair never officially confirmed they were dating and by 2019 reports of a split began to emerge. 

At the time insiders told People that the relationship had run 'its course,' explaining: 'This industry is very tough on relationships.'
