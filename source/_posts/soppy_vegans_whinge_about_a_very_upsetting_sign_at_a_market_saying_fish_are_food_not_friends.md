Vegans are up in arms over a sign reading 'fish are food, not friends' at a local market. 

The neon sign at Sydney's Paddington Markets depicted three fish swimming towards a fishing hook with the slogan emblazoned beside it. 

The man who posted the image online said the sign was 'awful' and that it flew in the face of the 'sealife not seafood' motto.

A large number of other vegans echoed the man's sentiments. 

'This is disgusting. Would be such a shame if someone came along and smashed the sign,' one wrote on social media, Yahoo News reported. 

'Anything to stay afloat. When these industries feel threatened, they try so hard to stay relevant,' another added. 

Plant eaters appeared to take exception to the sign, which was seemingly a play on a popular vegan term, 'friends not food'. 

The sign was located in the main hall of the market so the man said he couldn't attribute it to any one business.
