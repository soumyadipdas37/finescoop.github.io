A Hamptons socialite who spent weeks battling COVID-19 has revealed that she has been blindsided by divorce from her billionaire husband who reportedly asked her to commit to not gaining more than five pounds during their marriage and having sex with him at least four times a week.

Alex Kuczynski, 49, who is the daughter of Peru's former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, received divorce papers from Charles Stevenson Jr, 73, six days before Christmas last year, according to the New York Post. 

Stevenson, an investor and philanthropist worth just over $1billion, reportedly dumped Alex for one of their family friends.

Hamptons socialite, Alex Kuczynski, who spent weeks battling COVID-19 has revealed that she has been blindsided by divorce from her billionaire husband who reportedly made her commit to not gaining more than five pounds during their marriage and having sex with him at least four times a week.

One of Alex's friends told the Post that 'Alex is so incredibly hurt' and that 'no one knows why he wants to get rid of her so quickly'.

Stevenson was married to Alex for 18 years and sources close to them claim that Stevenson required certain conditions throughout their marriage. 

The Post reported that Stevenson asked Alex to commit to having sex with him at least four times a week. 

He also reportedly required that she not gain more than five pounds during their marriage. Representatives for Alex and Stevenson have denied those claims.   

Just months after receiving the divorce papers, Alex, who is a New York Times writer, tested positive for COVID-19 and stayed in lockdown with their children in Idaho. 

Meanwhile, Stevenson is said to have hunkered down at an ecological retreat that he owns in Idaho with his new girlfriend.   

Alex's lawyer, Steven Silpe, called the pre-nup 'horrendous' and 'an unconscionable agreement that we’re looking to set aside'.

Silpe also said the divorce proceedings got off to a rocky start last week at a courthouse in Central Islip.

While it's unclear what exactly brought on the divorce filing, Alex's friend claimed that Stevenson had become frustrated with Alex trying to clear her father's name in Peru. Alex is the daughter of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (pictured in 2017)

Silpe told the Post that when both parties arrived for a hearing, Stevenson, who owns numerous properties, including apartments at 740 Park Avenue in Manhattan, lied to court officers about where he had been quarantining. 

Stevenson claimed he was in New York quarantining but Alex reportedly outed him to the officers, prompting him to admit his actual whereabouts. 

'That’s how we started the case off,' Silpe said. 

Silpe told the Post that 'the numbers that are in the agreement are a tiny fraction of what the parties’ standard of living is, and what we believe the husband’s assets are'.

He said the agreement does not cover child support for their two kids, aged 11 and 12.

While it's unclear what exactly brought on the divorce filing, Alex's friend told the Post that Stevenson had become frustrated with Alex trying to clear her father's name in Peru. 

Her father, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who served as president of Peru between 2016 and 2018, is under investigation for corruption.  

He resigned after facing two impeachment votes following a corruption scandal that began in Brazil. 

Kuczynski has denied any wrongdoing.
