In the photo, Isabella posed in her bedroom while cradling her bump and looking down at her belly.

'Twenty-three weeks today,' she captioned the snap.

'It's been a beautiful journey and I can't believe we're finally at this point. It wouldn't have been possible without the amazing team at Monash IVF, so a huge thank you to them. I'm so excited to raise our child with you, beautiful.'
