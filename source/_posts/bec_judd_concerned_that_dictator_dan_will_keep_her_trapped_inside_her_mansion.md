Bec Judd is concerned that Melbourne's lockdown laws will be extended, forcing her to remain inside of her $7.3million Brighton mansion.

The media personality expressed her frustration towards Premier of Victoria Dan Andrews in an Instagram post on Friday to promote a cardboard company.

'@the_little_cardboard_co perfect for iso and upcoming school holidays as it seems Dictator Dan will be locking Victorians in our homes even longer,' she wrote.

The post has since been deleted from Judd's Instagram Stories.

The TV presenter and her husband, retired AFL star Chris Judd, have been on lockdown in their mansion with their four children, son Oscar, nine, daughter Billie, six, and three-year-old twins Tom and Darcy. 

Victoria just announced a record 59 new coronavirus deaths, its highest daily total during the pandemic.

Health bosses recorded 81 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, a marked drop since the 113 reported on Thursday.

The spike in deaths comes as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict Stage Four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks.

While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage Four restrictions.

‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’

Fifty of the deaths announced on Friday were people who passed away in aged care in July and August, after a federal and state government review of previous deaths in facilities across the state.

According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.

Victoria recorded 81 new cases on Friday. The state's death toll increased by 59, including 50 aged care deaths which occurred in July and August, taking the national toll to 737

Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.

According to the report, which was obtained by the Herald Sun, there are bigger changes coming from September 28, which includes the curfew being lifted and increased social gatherings.

But the Victorian Chamber of Commerce has denied there is a plan to extend Stage Four lockdown by two weeks - claiming it is out of date.
