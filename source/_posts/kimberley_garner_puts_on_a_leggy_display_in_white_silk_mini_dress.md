She is back in the UK after soaking up the sun in St Tropez last month. 

And Kimberley Garner showed off her holiday tan as she stepped out for dinner at celeb hotspot Chiltern Firehouse in London on Friday night.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 29, put on a very leggy display in a thigh-skimming cream silk mini dress that was cinched in at the waist with a belt.

She teamed the pretty dress with a chic black blazer and studded black boots as she headed into the busy restaurant. 

She kept her accessorises to a minimum so that all eyes were on her toned pins and looked relaxed for the swanky night out.

She wore her blonde tresses in her usual poker-straight style and opted for natural makeup to highlight her bronzed glow.

As she returned from European hot spot St Tropez last month, the model revealed that she tested negative for COVID-19.  

Kimberley was able to return to the UK just before the new quarantine restrictions were enforced which requires all tourists to self isolate for two weeks following her trip abroad. 

She penned on Instagram: '@kimberleylondon bikini 2 weeks ago in a now closed France. On the last night I decided to not go to a party, so tempting.

'A small gentle voice in my tummy said not to, and I listened. I believe in God, this gentle feeling. I'm the only person back who is COVID-19 negative. Trust that little feeling.' 

Earlier this summer, Kimberley was pictured with Made In Chelsea co-star Ollie Chambers, after enjoying a tennis session together.

Although Kimberley recently revealed that she has been having a 'great' time dating, she confirmed to MailOnline in July that her relationship with Ollie is purely platonic.

It came after she revealed she cancelled a secret wedding and ended a long-term relationship last summer.
