This is the adorable moment a dog responds to a grin and a thumbs up with a smile of his own.

Buddy, a six-year-old Bichon Frise, knows he gets a positive response when he shows his teeth, according to his owner. 

Kelly Ellise Lockett took a video of Buddy as she sat with family in the garden of their home in Liverpool.

The 34-second-long clip shows the sweet white dog dressed up in a grey coat while sitting on an outdoor sofa.

A man sitting next to the dog says 'Buddy, Buddy' to catch his attention before offering the dog two thumbs up and a huge smile.

Another man the other side of the dog nudges him and says 'smile', prompting the dog to show off his pearly whites.

His smile is even wider the second time and Kelly lets out a burst of laughter from behind the camera.

Kelly says 'cheese' as the group laugh along.

Dogs usually bar their teeth to show discomfort, but it could also be a sign of playfulness and excitement.   

Kelly said: 'Buddy responds to certain key words with a smile but Buddy smiles all the time. 

'We all laugh at him every time and he knows it gets a positive response so he does it more.'
