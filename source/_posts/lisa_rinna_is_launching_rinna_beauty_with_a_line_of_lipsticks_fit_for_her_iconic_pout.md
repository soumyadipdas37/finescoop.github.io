Everyone from Rihanna to Selena Gomez has done it, and now this Real Housewife is finally getting in on the action, too.

RHOBH's own Lisa Rinna heralded the arrival of her signature cosmetics brand Rinna Beauty on Thursday, with a timeless shot of her famous lips along with the concurrent launch of a devoted Instagram account named for the new makeup line.

As seen at Allure, the reality star, 57, is launching Rinna Beauty with three luxury lip kits, each priced at $45, beginning September 28th.

'I've always joked about being the lip pioneer,' the mother-of-two said. 'I've always wanted to do something with these lips. 

'I finally feel like we're getting to do it and have fun and have a sense of humor, and really bring quality items that I just absolutely love, that my heart and soul are in and part of,' Lisa continued. 

Of her plans for the line, Lisa said, 'of course I want to go into everything down the line. Rinna Beauty is going to be a lifestyle brand. 

'But we started with three lip kits — in nude, nude-pink and nude-coral, because that is what I wear,' the Bravo star told Allure.

On Instagram, Rinna chose a closeup shot taken by photographer Greg Swales in which she stares straight at the camera from underneath a black fedora, to announce the arrival of the lipstick line.

As always, the focus of Lisa's face in the snap is her iconic pout, bathed here in a creamy gloss.

'BREAKING NEWS!' she wrote in the caption, along with a healthy helping of lipstick kiss emojis. 'RINNA BEAUTY Rinnabeauty.com It’s finally here! @rinnabeauty'

In keeping with Lisa's trademark spunk and grit, the shade names for her lipsticks are Birthday Suit, Legends Only and No Apologies — the last one especially serving as an ode to her unapologetic spirit. 

The kits will include a lip liner, a lipstick, and a lip gloss. 

And when asked who inspired Lisa when it came to conceiving the new line, she didn't hesitate with a lengthy and impassioned answer. 

'Certainly my daughters [Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray] are an inspiration. Every single second of every single day,' the wife of Harry Hamlin replied.

'I have so many great friends and so many beautiful friends. I mean, you just, you think of everybody and I'm so inspired by not only the girls on the show, Erika [Girardi] and Dorit [Kemsley] and Kyle [Richards]... all of my friends are beautiful, strong women.' 

But Lisa didn't stop there: 'I'm inspired by my 92-year-old mom, who's worn lipstick and won't go out of the house, by the way, without her makeup' she added when speaking to Allure. 

'I've actually never seen my mom go out in public without lipstick. [So] I want this to be all-inclusive. I want men, women, children — everybody! — to use Rinna Beauty.'
