Meghan Markle's close friends have joined her rallying cry to encourage US citizens to register to vote ahead of the November election.

The Duchess of Sussexes' former Suits co-stars Abigail Spencer, 38, from LA, and Sarah Rafferty, 45, as well as the royal's BFF Misha Nonoo all shared Instagram posts yesterday to ask their followers to register and tell their friends to do the same. 

Abigail and Misha shared the same image on their Instagram stories featuring a black image with white text reading: 'Instagram can wait. Register to vote.'

It comes within hours of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's controversial video message speaking out about the upcoming U.S. election despite the British royal family's strict political neutrality.

Suits actress Sarah shared a selfie wearing a bold black mask with the word 'Vote' written across it in large white writing. 

She posted: 'When we ALL vote, our democracy begins to reflect our communities and values. 

'Happy National Voter Registration Week of Action! Celebrate with me by making your voting plan ASAP with @Whenweallvote.' 

Meghan has previously described former Suits co-star Sarah as 'not just my Suits sister wife, but my sister'. 

Suits star Sarah Rafferty, whom the Duchess of Sussex has previously called her 'sister-wife', donned a bold black mask featuring the word 'Vote' as she encouraged citizens to register yesterday 

Meanwhile fellow co-star Abigail  shared an Instagram post, which featured the caption: 'Today on #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, text VOTER to 26797 to make sure you are registered to vote and to receive all important election information.

'If you are already registered, text VOTER to 26797 to find out if you are eligible to vote early or to vote by mail and request your mail-in ballot.'

The royal knows actress Abigail from her Suits days as well, with the duo playing Rachel Zane, a senior paralegal and later associate at Zane Specter Litt, and Dana "Scottie" Scott, Gabriel Macht's character's old rival, respectively.

Abigail cemented their friendship over the festive period when she was seen on a New Year's Day hike with Prince Harry and Meghan in Vancouver Island's Horth Hill Regional Park during their Christmas getaway. 

Meghan's close friend Misha Nonoo also shared a snap encouraging her followers to vote, and said she would be donating 10 per cent of her sales to non-profit organisations working to increase voter turnout 

The Duchess and Misha have long-been close friends, with the duo working together on Meghan's charity collection Smart Set last year (pictured together in 2015) 

Abigail has often been seen enjoying low-key meetings with the Royal, including her appearance at Meghan's baby shower in New York in February 2019 along with tennis star Serena Williams and her close friend and make-up artist Daniel Martin. 

Meghan's close friend Misha Nonoo also encouraged her followers to register yesterday.

The mother-of-one shared the same image, posting: 'The voter turnout rate in the 2016 Presidential election was only 61%, and over 100 million eligible voters did not vote. We are only 42 days away from the election so we are partnering with @IamVoter to help make sure people: 1) register 2) make a plan 3) vote.

'All this week we will be donating 10% of our sales to this non-partisan, non-profit organization working to increase voter turnout.'

Meanwhile fellow Suits co-star Abigail Spencer also shared the post asking followers to register to vote yesterday 

Abigail joined the star as she marked her baby shower in the US last year and went on to cement their friendship over the festive period when she was seen on a New Year's Day hike with Prince Harry and Meghan in Vancouver Island' 

She added: 'Our democracy works best when we all participate!'

The comments from Meghan's friends come as the Duchess becomes more politically active ahead of the election in November.

Speaking in a Time 100 video message shared yesterday, apparently filmed from her California home, the Duke of Sussex told voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' while the Duchess called the presidential race the 'most important election of our lifetime' as the couple urged Americans to use their right to vote.   

Over the past few weeks, Meghan has taken part in multiple interviews and summits - having reportedly grown 'frustrated' at her inability to get involved in politics while she was working as a senior royal.

It comes after feminist activist Gloria Steinem revealed that Markle had joined her in cold-calling Americans and urging them to vote

This week, feminist activist Gloria Steinem revealed that Markle had joined her in cold-calling Americans and urging them to vote.

 Steinem told Access Hollywood: 'She came home to vote. The first thing we did, and why she came to see me, was we sat at the dining room table where I am right now and we cold-called voters.'

'Said 'hello I'm Meg' and 'hello I'm Gloria' and 'are you going to vote?' That was her initiative.'

Meghan also told Steinem she was 'so excited' to see fellow mixed-race woman Kamala Harris nominated for vice president, in another strong hint that she is backing the Democratic ticket. 

Meanwhile, she has also taken in voter appeals, at which she made a bold plea to women across the US to take part in the 2020 presidential election, speaking out about the need for 'change' at an online voter summit, while telling participants: 'If we aren't part of the solution, we are part of the problem.'
