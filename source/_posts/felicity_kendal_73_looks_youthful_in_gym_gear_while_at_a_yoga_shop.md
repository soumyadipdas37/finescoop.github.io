LAST year she admitted that she likes to have Botox every six months to stem the ravages of time.

And it appears to be working wonders for Felicity Kendal, who looked youthful as she stepped out in West London shortly before her 74th birthday on September 25.

The actress certainly appeared to still be living the Good Life as she stopped off at upmarket yoga shop Lululemon and the beauty emporium Space NK. 

Wow! Felicity Kendal, 73, showed off her youthful complexion as she stepped out in form-fitting gym gear during an outing to a yoga shop in London on Tuesday

Looking svelte having clearly kept herself in shape during lockdown, Miss Kendal wore navy blue leggings, a matching oversized shirt and white trainers.

The TV star, holding a bottle of water, hand sanitiser and a pack of tissues, followed guidelines and put on a mask each time she entered a shop.

Last year Miss Kendal, who played Barbara Good in 1970s sitcom The Good Life, revealed that she is a fan of Botox. 'I do it every six months, then you don't get the terrible little frown line,' she told the Sunday Times magazine.

However the grandmother-of-two recently revealed she has given up Botox and instead relies on yoga, pilates and weightlifting to stay youthful. 

She told Good Housekeeping magazine: ‘There comes a point where you have to match bits of you with the other bits.’   

While she's never had a face-lift, the actress has had fillers around her mouth.

Felicity explained: 'Then there was a time when you'd think, I'm over 60, I can't possibly wear a short skirt again because of my crinkly knees.

'Then you come out the other end and say, f*** it, I've got good legs, I'm going to put on tights and a short skirt.' 

Felicity became a beloved household name starring in The Good Life, despite running for just 30 episodes over four series.

The mother-of-two converted to Judaism while married to her second husband Michael Rudman, who is Jewish.

The couple divorced in 1990 but have since got back together. Her first marriage to actor Drewe Henley lasted 11 years, and she was only 21 when they married.

She has two grandchildren, but says she has 12 in total as she counts her late sister’s children and their children as her own, as well as Rudman’s from his first marriage.
