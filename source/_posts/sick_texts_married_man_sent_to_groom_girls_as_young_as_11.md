A married man used two fake Instagram account pretending to be a 14-year-old boy so he could groom five young girls for sex - yet he's only going to spend nine months in jail.

Andrew Stephen Jewitt, 43, from Logan in south-east Queensland, was arrested after the guardian of one of the girls, who was just 11, alerted police after seeing one of the disturbing messages, according to The Courier Mail. 

Jewitt even went to one of the girl's houses, the court heard. 

Jewitt, who is married, pleaded guilty in Beenleigh Magistrate's Court on Wednesday to three counts of grooming a child under the age of 16, two counts of grooming a child under the age of 12, and one count of possessing child exploitation material. 

Andrew Stephen Jewitt, 43, from Logan in south-east Queensland, was arrested after the guardian of one of the girls, who was 11-years-old, alerted police after seeing one of the disturbing messages 

An example of the messages that Jewitt sent to the young girls over the space of 12 months 

The court heard he created two fake Instagram accounts, one as a 14-year-old boy, under which he began talking to the girls, sending them explicit messages, and visiting two of the girls addresses to deliver gifts and letters to their mailbox. 

The offending took place over roughly 12 months between April 2018 until he was arrested on April 10 2019, prosecutors said. 

The fake 14-year-old's account was established under the name of Sam Richards who claimed he was from the Gold Coast and whose father had committed suicide while his mother was a drug addict who blamed him. 

Jewitt will be released as early as January 2021 on parole 

The phoney Richards told the girls he was self-harming and talking to them was the only thing that made him 'feel alive'. 

The 43-year-old sent the young victims pornographic images from the account and one 11-year-old girl sent a topless picture back, resulting in the child exploitation material charge when he was caught by detectives. 

The graphic and disturbing messages to each victim, aged 15, 13, 12, and two 11-year-olds were read to the court. 

Jewitt, spent four months in custody before his sentencing and will be released as early as January 2021 on parole. 

VICTIM ONE 

This girl was 15-years-old when Jewitt approached her online in 2018. 

Prosecutors said the conversation turned 'degrading' over 12-months and Jewitt repeatedly messaged her that he wanted to 'f*** her'.

After she turned 16, she sent him compromising images of herself. 

VICTIM TWO

Jewitt began talking to an 11-year-old online in February 2019 and only stopped after police arrested him. 

Prosecutors said he convinced the girl to send five images of herself, including pictures in her underwear and topless, and she revealed her address after which Jewitt would deliver gifts and letters to her mailbox. 

'I want to be naughty and naked with you,' one of Jewitt's messages read. 

'I want to lick your beautiful body,' another read. 

He also sent the 11-year-old highly explicit pornographic videos. 

VICTIM THREE

This victim was 13-years-old when Jewitt approached her online two weeks before his arrest. 

He convinced the girl under a fake online account that he was a boy from her high school and she should keep their communication secret. 

He went to her house and left a t-shirt in her mailbox and received non-explicit pictures from her. 



'I'm rubbing my d*** thinking about you,' Jewitt wrote to the girl. 

'You're so f****** cute and pretty, send me a picture of your sexy legs,' he wrote in another message. 

VICTIM FOUR

Jewitt began talking to a 12-year-old girl about two weeks before his arrest. 

The court heard he told her 'daily' that he 'loved her' and also delivered gifts to her house. 

VICTIM FIVE 

Jewitt messaged this 11-year-old days before his arrest. Her guardian raised the alarm with authorities.  



'My wonderful, amazing, beautiful girl, I hope we can be amazing trustworthy honest friends,' Jewitt wrote to her. 

He also spun the girl the fake tale about Richard's troubled childhood.
