She also covered her mouth and nose with a black face mask amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Ashley had her blonde hair straight down around her shoulders and let her natural beauty shine without makeup.

Her distressed T-shirt featured an image of Iggy, 73, on the front and read 'BLAH BLAH BLAH' on the back in a reference to the rocker's 1986 seventh studio album 'Blah-Blah-Blah'.

Ashley brought her two beloved dogs with her while visiting a design studio and they shared a double dog leash.

The Anaheim Hills, California native last week took to social media to encourage her 21.3 million followers on Instagram to vote.

She shared a selfie Friday using a filter to color her face with hearts, smiley faces, the female gender symbol, flowers and a voting sticker.

'Vote!' was written across her forehead, while 'power to the people,' was near her hairline and 'BLM,' was drawn on her cheek

Ashley also held up a dainty gold necklace that read 'vote' and she reiterated her message by writing the same word as a caption.
