Leeds are plotting a second bid to lure lightning-heeled Wales winger Daniel James from Manchester United, according to reports.

The 22-year-old was set to sign for Marcelo Bielsa's side in January 2019 before his switch from Championship Swansea collapsed on transfer deadline day.  

He joined United for £18million in June last year but barely featured at the end of last season, starting just one of the club's final 10 fixtures.

Manchester United wideman Daniel James is being courted by Leeds after falling out of favour 

James was replaced by Mason Greenwood at the interval as United slumped to a 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Long-term admirer Bielsa believes he could capture James for around £12million plus add-ons, The Sun has reported. 

Leeds could also consider a loan move for the out-of-favour youngster, who would add scintillating pace to an attack that has provided seven goals in their opening two Premier League games.

James made a dazzling start to his career at the club but has barely featured in recent months 

James scored three times in the opening four games of last season, netting within minutes of coming on for his debut in the 4-0 opening day win over Chelsea.

He also provided seven assists but has not scored a Premier League goal for more than a year.

The 22-year-old helped Wales to qualify for Euro 2020 and has been supported by Ryan Giggs
