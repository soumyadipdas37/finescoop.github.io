Katie is certainly no stranger to causing a stir after her Love Island 2016 appearance.

She is best known to viewers of the ITV2 show for pairing up with the late Sophie Gradon on the reality dating series.

Sophie was originally partnered with Tom Powell but later coupled up with Katie after he quit the show.

However, Sophie later dumped Katie and bowed out of the show to be with Tom again, leading Katie to pair off with Adam Maxted. Their romance was short-lived, lasting just two weeks after the series drew to a close. 

Katie opened up about the abuse she received from the LGBT community, following her same-sex romance with late Love Island star Sophie.

Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme last year, Katie admitted she was the subject of much uproar after her relationship with Sophie, who was tragically found dead in June 2018 aged just 32.

She said: 'In the villa I was so scared because I didn't know what the outside world was thinking, what my family was thinking, what my friends were thinking, so I was really upset that they'd not supported me from my own community.'
