Coronation Street favourites Sally and Tim Metacafe are set to finally tie the knot next week, however, their plans could be scuppered by Tim's bitter dad Geoff.

After evil Geoff (Ian Bartholomew) was exposed over his horrendous treatment of long-suffering wife Yasmeen, Tim (Joe Duttine) and Sally (Sally Dynevor) have both washed their hands of him.

But the couple's plan to secretly get married without inviting Geoff looks set to be ruined as the police show up during their big day.

Wedding drama: Coronation Street favourites Sally and Tim Metacafe are set to finally tie the knot next week, however, their plans could be scuppered by Tim's bitter dad Geoff

The much-loved couple were originally set to become man and wife five years ago, but the marriage was declared null void after it turned out that Tim was still married to his first wife Charlie.

Then their attempt to tie the knot again went pear-shaped recently after Sally discovered the money that Geoff had given them for the wedding actually stolen from his now imprisoned wife Yasmeen (Shelley King). 

But with Geoff's despicable behaviour now out in the open, Tim and Sally quietly make plans to hold a small ceremony without him - but Geoff soon gets wind of their idea.

After Tim's daughter Faye (Ellie Leach) accidentally lets the cat out the bag, Geoff begs his son to let him attend his big day, but a determined Tim rejects him.

Speaking to Inside Soap, actor Joe Duttine discussed his alter ego Tim's big day, he said: 'They really want to try and keep the wedding a secret from Geoff, and Faye feels terrible that she has let slip to Geoff about the wedding. The last thing Tim wants is his dad ruining something else.

Drama: 'This is too important a day for Tim. He knows that Geoff hates Sally and he does almost manage to spoil it, but there are too many people willing to step in and help Sally and Tim'

'This is too important a day for Tim. He knows that Geoff hates Sally and he does almost manage to spoil it, but there are too many people willing to step in and help Sally and Tim.'

He added: 'He messed up before and even though it wasn't deliberate on his part, he has to make it up to Sally. The spectre of Geoff is wanting to be at the feast and he is the last person anyone wants there.'
