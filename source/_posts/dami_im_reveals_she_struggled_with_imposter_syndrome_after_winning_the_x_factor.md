Dami Im was crowned the winner of The X Factor Australia back in 2013, and has gone on to have huge success in the music industry. 

But on Saturday, the 31-year-old revealed that in the early stages of her career, she struggled with imposter syndrome.

'Sometimes I felt really small, that impostor syndrome, that I didn't have what it takes to be an artist,' she told The Daily Telegraph at the weekend.

Impostor syndrome is the feeling of being undeserving of their achievements or that one is not as competent or intelligent as others might think, according to Psychology Today.

The South Korean-born star revealed to the publication that she had 'no idea' how to navigate the music industry.

'The first few years I had no idea how I was supposed to navigate through the jungle of the music industry; it was like doing an apprenticeship,' she said.

But since winning the now-defunct singing competition, Dami has proven to be a force on the Australian music scene.

She has released five successful studio albums, toured the country and even starred on Dancing With The Stars earlier this year.

Most notably, Dami represented Australia in the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm, Sweden, where she performed Sound of Silence and came in second place.
