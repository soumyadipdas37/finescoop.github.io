Bayern Munich forward Kingsley Coman is set to miss Friday's Bundesliga opener against Schalke as he is self-isolating at home after he had contact with a person infected with coronavirus. 

The German giants confirmed the France winger would need to spend 'a period in isolation' and will undertake remote virtual training sessions.
