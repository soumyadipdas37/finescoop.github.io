Burnley are through to the next round of the EFL Cup, with the game decided by a penalty shootout after it finished 1-1.  

David McGoldrick scored a goal for the visitors after just four minutes, but Burnley got back into the game through Matej Vydra in the second half.

Nick Pope saved Oli McBurnie's effort in the penalty shootout, and the home side scored all of their spot kicks to get the victory.
