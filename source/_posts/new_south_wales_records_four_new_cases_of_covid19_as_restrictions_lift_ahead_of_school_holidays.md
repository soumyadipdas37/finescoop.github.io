Four new cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in New South Wales on Friday as thousands of school children break for holidays.

Three cases are returned travellers who are in hotel quarantine, while another the fourth is someone who was at a Woolworths in Campbelltown Mall, western Sydney.

Anyone who was at the supermarket in the shopping centre between 1.30pm and 2pm on September 17 is considered a casual contact and must monitor for symptoms. 

The man in his 50s, who's case was announced on Thursday, has not come into contact with a known case. 

Contact tracing and investigations continue. 

Testing numbers have dropped over recent weeks and health authorities urge people, particular in South Western Sydney, to come forward and get tested if they have symptoms.  

More to come.
