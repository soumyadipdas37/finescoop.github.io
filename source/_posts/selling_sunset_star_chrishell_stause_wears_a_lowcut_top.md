 Chrishell Stause is taking her time on Dancing With The Stars very seriously as she has been showing up for rehearsals nearly every day.

The Selling Sunset star was spotted again on Monday as she walked up to the dance studio with her partner Gleb Savchenko.

The 39-year-old blonde beauty wore a plunging white workout top that also showed off her toned midsection.

The siren also had on high-waisted black sweatpants in a shiny material and held on to a white sweatshirt with red cherries in sequins.

The star had her long, pointy nails painted white and she added a dainty gold necklace.

At one point, the reality TV diva took off her green and black polka dot CDC-approved face mask to given onlookers a megawatt smile.

The Los Angeles resident's long blonde hair was worn down and in a beach-style with windswept waves as she carried a black backpack.

Gelb wore a light denim shirt with dark denim jeans and black-and-white sneakers. He too carried a backpack but his was purple and black.

Her partner went with a black face mask. 

Savchenko is a 37-year-old Russian dancer, choreographer, and model. He previously appeared on the UK, Australian, and Russian versions of DWTS.

In 2016, Savchenko took part in the British television cooking show Celebrity MasterChef.   

The Selling Sunset reality star has been trying hard during season 29 of the ABC dance competition.

The two performed a tango on Monday night's season premiere which left judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough somewhat unimpressed. They gave the couple a score of just 13 points out of a possible 30.

Backstreet Boys singer A J McLean was unmissable in a colorful hoodie and bright blue designer sneakers.

The 42-year-old, who is paired with pro Cheryl Burke, had three hats perched on top of his head and wore a black cloth face mask.

He also had his hands full, carrying a camo backpack over one shoulder and a beverage in each hand along with a small black case. 

He and Burke go into round two with 18 points from the judges for their jumping jive performance. 

Other contestants on season 29 are Tiger King star Carole Baskin, The Bachelorette's Kaitlyn Bristowe, former NFL tight end Vernon Davis, actress Anne Heche, TV host Jeannie Mai, actor Jesse Metcalfe, rapper Nelly, former NBA power forward Charles Oakley, Catfish host Nev Schulman, Cheer star Monica Aldama and ice skater Johnny Weir, among others.
