Alessandra Ambrosio braved the smoke-covered beach of Malibu on Sunday to play a game of volleyball. 

The Victoria's Secret model, 39, chose not to stay indoors amid the wildfires crisis that has gripped the West Coast as she joined friends for a friendly match. 

Ensuring all eyes would be on her, the mother-of-two stunned in a tiny burnt orange bikini that showcased her supermodel frame. 

What wildfires? Alessandra Ambrosio braved the smoke-covered beach of Malibu on Sunday to play a game of volleyball

Alessandra put her incredibly toned abs on display and flashed a glimpse of her cleavage in the rust hued bikini top that was adorned with delicate bead decoration. 

She teamed the garment with a pair of matching tie side briefs worn beneath a pair of tiny navy shorts to showcased her enviably toned and tanned legs.  

The Brazilian model and television personality completed the look by layering up gold necklaces, donning mirrored oversized shades and styling her glossy chestnut locks in beachy waves.

Alessandra seemed in great spirits as she frolicked on the beach even though it was engulfed in an ominous cloud of smoke as strong southerly winds and low humidity look set to result in elevated fire weather conditions across California.

The raging West Coast wildfires have created dangerous air quality conditions equivalent to smoking 20 packs of cigarettes, according to California Gov Gavin Newsom.

In California alone, the fires have killed 22 people and at least 11 other deaths have been reported across Oregon and Washington state.

Newsom said the wildfires, which have charred over 3.2 million acres and destroyed about 4,000 structures in California, 'is equivalent to smoking 20 packs of cigarettes'.

According to IQAir.com, which tracks air quality around the world, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles all have some of the worst in the world. Portland is at the top of the list.

Public health officials warned residents to keep indoors with the windows shut, to set air conditioners to run on recirculated air instead of fresh, and to use air purifiers if they had them.

Born in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande Do Sul, Alessandra has lived in the States for about two decades, having had to move to New York City to kick off her successful modeling career as a teenager. 

Last week she was spotted emerging from an immigration office in Los Angeles after spending 15 minutes in the federal building, reportedly after becoming a United States citizen. 

Alessandra rose to international fame as a Victoria's Secret Angel, announcing that she was giving up the title at the end of 2017.

She has since collaborated with her sister Aline and a pal called Gisele Coria to launch her swimwear line Gal Floripa, which debuted last March.

The brand takes its title from a nickname for Florianopolis, the Brazilian city where Alessandra gave birth to both of her children.

Alessandra shares her 12-year-old daughter Anja and her eight-year-old son Noah with her ex-fiance, RE/DONE founder Jamie Mazur. The couple split in March 2018 after a 10 year engagement, and amicably co-parent their children. 

In July that year, Alessandra revealed she was dating Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi and spent the last few months in lockdown isolating with her boyfriend and her children.
