Dereck Chisora has fired a warning to upcoming opponent Oleksandr Usyk that he is physically stronger than everyone else in the heavyweight division.

The 36-year-old has made the extraordinary claim as he seeks to end the Ukrainian's undefeated record in their showdown on October 31.

He is also looking to reclaim his status as WBO mandatory challenger despite a 32-9 record.

The 36-year-old is seeking to end the Ukrainian's undefeated record in the ring next month

'I am not losing. I'm going all out, guns blazing,' Chisora told Sky Sports.  

'The way I will come for him will be unbelievable. I will go through him. 

'I don't think, in the heavyweight game, there is anybody stronger than me right now.

'Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury, Dillian Whyte, Deontay Wilder? No, they aren't stronger than me.

'I'm stronger, crazier and I want it more.' 

Chisora believes he is stronger than everyone in the heavyweight division - even Tyson Fury

Chisora insists he is 'stronger, crazier and wants it more' than rivals, including Anthony Joshua

Usyk and Chisora were originally set to go head-to-head on May 23, but the fight was delayed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic 

Now after a hiatus of more than five months, they will collide at the end of October, with a venue to be confirmed soon. 

Usyk has become the undisputed cruiserweight king, but is now targeting all the world heavyweight belts to keep himself on course for a WBO mandatory title fight with Anthony Joshua.

But the 33-year-old must first turn his attentions to defeating Chisora, who overpowered Artur Szpilka at The O2 in July last year, 12 months after his stunning eighth-round knockout of Carlos Takam at the same location.
