Tens of thousands of 18-year-olds could unknowingly be entitled to a payout from a child trust fund set up on their behalf. 

The funds were launched 15 years ago with every child born between September 1, 2002 and January 31, 2011 given a helping hand from the Government in the form of a voucher worth £250. 

In some cases a further top-up payment of £250 was made if the child was born between September 1, 2009 and July 31, 2010. Poorer families received £500 in each case. 

Helping hand: Many funds will now be maturing without the account holder knowing they are eligible to receive the proceeds 

Though many parents added to the new-style savings accounts, others did not use the voucher. The Government responded by setting up a stakeholder account on the child's behalf. 

Many of these funds will now be maturing without the account holder knowing they are eligible to receive the proceeds. 

This is especially true for those who have moved home in the past 15 years and so have not received any paperwork. In some cases, the payouts could be four-figure sums. 

Eighteen-year-olds can find details of their fund by visiting https://gov.uk/child-trust-funds/ find-a-child-trust-fund. Also, the Share Foundation charity can help those aged 16 and over locate their fund. 

From age 16, an individual can take control of their account, but they cannot withdraw money until they are 18. Visit findctf.sharefound.org to fill in the form. 

Those whose child trust funds are maturing can take the money – or invest it in a tax-friendly Isa. 

On average, some 55,000 18-year-olds a month will be eligible for a pay-out between now and 2029.
