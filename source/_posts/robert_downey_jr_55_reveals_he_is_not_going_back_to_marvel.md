Robert Downey Jr is 'done' with the Marvel cinematic universe.

The 55-year-old star, who played Tony Stark in Iron Man and several other spinoffs such as Avengers, made the comments to Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes on their podcast SmartLess.

'That's all done,' said the former child star. 'As far as I'm concerned, I hung up my guns and I'm good to let it go.'

No more Tony: Robert Downey Jr is 'done' with the Marvel cinematic universe, he said this week

His first Iron Man movie came out in 2008. 

He then went in to star in 2010's Iron Man 2, next came his role in The Avengers in 2012, then Iron Man 3 in 2013 followed by Avengers: Age Of Ultron in 2015, Captain America: Civil War in 2016, Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).

His character was killed in Endgame and he was given a nod in Spider-Man: Far From Home.

Robert had a cameo appearance in The Incredible Hulk (2008) and is expected to be seen in Black Widow, likely in a flashback.

New news: The 55-year-old star, who played Tony Stark in Iron Man and several other spinoffs such as Avengers, made the comments to Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes on their podcast SmartLess. Seen in Iron Man 2

Over: 'That's all done,' said the former child star. 'As far as I'm concerned, I hung up my guns and I'm good to let it go.' Seen in Iron Man 3 with Gwyneth Paltrow

The Less Than Zero actor added on the podcast: 'I also think that Marvel is on this journey now. They’re trying a bunch of other stuff and you know, I’m excited for them to see how all that goes.' 

This news came after Apple greenlit a straight-to-series order for a brand new drama from Robert and Team Downey, his production company with wife, Susan Downey.

The Downeys are teaming with Adam Perlman (Billions, The Good Wife, The Newsroom) for the untitled project that may include Robert playing a supporting role.

A spinoff: The veteran actor also starred with Jeremy Renner, Lou Ferrigno, Samuel L Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth in the 2012 film The Avengers 

Yet in another: In 2018 came Averngers: Infinity War with Robert, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Wong

Team Downey and Amanda Burrell (Hot Cities, Perry Mason, Sweet Tooth) will serve as executive producers alongside Pearlman, who will be one of the writers, according to Variety.

The series is based on the Toronto Life article The Sting, written by Michael Lista, who will also co-executive produce.

It follows a frustrated Canadian detective who decides to investigate a decades-old cold case in hopes of winning a confession and becoming a hero. 

As the drama begins to play out, the case quickly spirals out of control when the undercover officer attempts an elaborate sting, adding playacting cops, taxpayer resources, and an unexpected friendship with the peculiar target. 

If Downey Jr. does in fact sign on for a role in the new drama, it would be his first regular TV role since he played Larry Paul in comedy-drama series Ally McBeal (2000-2002) nearly two decades ago.   

New deal: Robert and his Team Downey production company with wife, Susan Downey, have signed on with Apple for a brand new drama series that may include Robert playing a supporting role; seen with Susan in January

So far there's no word on when production will kick-off or who will star in the upcoming series.   

Team Downey currently produces the HBO drama Perry Mason, starring Matthew Rhys, that premiered in June and has already been renewed for a second season.

The cast also includes Juliet Rylance, Chris Chalk, Shea Whigham, Stephen Root, Gayle Rankin, Nate Corddry, Veronica Falcon, Jefferson Mays, Lili Taylor, Andrew Howard and Eric Lange.  

The show is a reboot of the Perry Mason TV series that starred Raymond Burr as the title character, which ran for nine seasons between 1957 and 1966. 

Teen dream: Originally, Downey Jr made a name for himself in Hollywood working in several teen films in the 1980s; he is pictured with co-star Andrew McCarthy in the 1987 film Less Than Zero

The Downey's production company is also producing the upcoming Netflix drama series Sweet Tooth, which was ordered to series earlier this year.     

Originally, Downey Jr. made a name for himself in Hollywood working in several teen films with the group of young actors known as the Brat Pack in the 1980s. In more recent years he's best known to fans for his performances in the Iron Man franchise and other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Susan Downey is a prolific film producer whose credits include Gothika (2003), The Brave One (2005), House Of Wax (2005) and Orphan (2009), Iron Man 2 (2010) and Doolittle (2020).
