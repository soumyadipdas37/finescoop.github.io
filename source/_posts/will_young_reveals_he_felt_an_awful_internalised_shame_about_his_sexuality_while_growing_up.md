Will Young spoke candily about the 'internalised shame' he felt about being gay while growing up.

The singer appeared on Channel 4 show Sunday Brunch to promote his new book To Be A Gay Man, and admitted the last decade has seen him confront a lot of feelings about his sexuality. 

Will, 41, admitted he only discovered he felt 'gay shame' at the age of 32. 

Speaking out: Will Young spoke candily about the 'internalised shame' he felt about being gay while growing up in a new interview with Sunday Brunch this weekend 

Speaking on the Channel 4 show to hosts Tim Lovejoy and Simon Rimmer, the Leave Right Now hitmaker recalled the 'awful, internalised shame' he felt growing up gay. 

He said: 'I was doing this podcast, it was an LGBT podcast, and a lot of gay shame came up a lot. 

'Gay shame is a particular thing when if you are growing up feeling like you are wrong in society and all the messages that you are getting from movies, TV, I mean this is like back in the day, so much better now, is that you are defunct and you are wrong.

'It creates this awful, internalised shame and it starts from when you are really young and its a topic that is quite under-explored.'

Will described how he 'did't realise' he had 'gay shame' until he was 'about 32' but 'got out of it'.

He went on to explain that reflecting on his life for his book caused him to confront his emotions.

'Some of the stories I had completely forgotten,’ he said. 'It’s soul-destroying to walk around thinking, "I am not for this world, I am wrong," it destroys your inner being.’ 

Release: Will added author to his skill set with the release of his book, entitled To Be A Gay Man, which is 'part self-help guide and part memoir'

"But it was all just part of the parcel,' he stressed. 'People were homophobic about you on the radio, on TV or in the press – you didn’t do anything about it, it was just the way it was.' 

A synopsis from the star's book reads: 'Will Young's journey to becoming a happily open gay man has been set back by damaging stigma, hurtful experiences, and the inner shame that comes from a society that still portrays homosexuality as "wrong" or "other".

'From the word "gay" being used as an insult on the playground to horrific homophobic attacks such as the 1999 nail bomb attack on one of Soho's oldest gay pubs; Will has grown up surrounded with messages that his true self is not accepted. 

Siblings: Will has had a tough month, following the tragic death of his twin brother Rupert who died in August after years of battling mental health issues, pictured at a party in 2009

Will has had a tough month, following the tragic death of his twin brother Rupert who died in August after years of battling mental health issues. 

Rupert, 41, previously spoke about his struggles with alcohol and depression, while also admitting his sibling's Pop Idol win in 2002 had impacted their relationship.

He was diagnosed with dysthymia – a depressive mood disorder – in 2005.  

His family, including brother Will who was born 10 minutes before Rupert, were said to have been left wracked by grief.

A friend said: 'Will's relationship with Rupert had been tough over the years at times, and they had both spoken about the mental health problems which had made it challenging.

'But there were hopes he had turned a corner and they are a very loving family - and utterly devastated by his passing.'  

Will previously revealed how he had been temporarily separated from his twin brother at birth, when Rupert was placed in an incubator due to illness, something which had caused the singer long-term psychological damage.

He later received six months of treatment for PTSD, triggered by their separation, his years of keeping his homosexuality a secret and being bullied at school. 

Will shot to fame almost two decades ago when he was crowned the victor over runner-up Gareth Gates during the inaugural season of Pop Idol.
