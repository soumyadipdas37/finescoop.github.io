She is expecting her first child later on in this year. 

And Ashley James cradled her blossoming baby bump and rolled around on a birthing ball as she marked being 26 weeks pregnant on Monday. 

The former Made In Chelsea star, 33, let her natural beauty shine through in her candid Instagram posts as she divulged the challenges she has faced during pregnancy.

The blonde beauty displayed her sun-kissed complexion in a black nursing bra and matching black briefs. 

Her tousled tresses were swept effortlessly to the side.

Ashley opted for a makeup-free look as she gave a soft smile and posed in front of trinkets and furniture for her baby on the way.

The reality star revealed she recently purchased a birthing ball as she is starting to feel 'stretched' by her expanding tummy.

She shared a video of herself rolling around on the ball in plaid bottoms and a supportive maternity band as she said on Instagram: '26 weeks. I'm pretty sure this means it's my last week of the second trimester and only about 14 weeks left until we meet the baby!

'This week has mainly been about reminding myself I'm not invincible (as much as I like to think I am), and reminding myself of all the positive things about being pregnant during these weird times. 

'My body is definitely starting to feel stretched, especially after a big meal. I'm using body oil to keep my skin nice and stretchy (it also really relieves itchy nipples!).

Social distancing: Ashley reflected on the difficulties she has faced with the current coronavirus restrictions including not being able to see her family

'I took a break from training and reduced my length of walks, and that seems to have helped reduce the pain around my pelvis, so I'm ready to get back to training this week. 

'Oh, I also got a birthing ball. Not being able to go see my family was a bit gutting, however we did a family zoom call and there's some other perks about the current lockdown (trying to look on the brightside): the 10pm curfew means I get to see my friends and still get to bed early,' accompanied by a winking emoji. 

Ashley also revealed that she and her partner, Tom Andrews, have decided their child's name but have not announced it to the public yet. 

The reality star hopes that coronavirus restrictions won't intensify so her partner, 31, will be able to stay by her side throughout her labour.

She added: 'I spoke to my midwife this week to find out the current guidelines with partners being allowed in the birth and was reassured to know my hospital is now allowing partners in for labour AND the birth. 

'Visitors in the postnatal care have visiting hours, but at least Tommy can be there for birth. 

'Could be worth a message to your midwife as I know every hospital is different (also if it's not good news, remember things might still change and we can't control the future so worrying won't change anything).

'I bought some shelving from @notonthehighstreet and we put those up this week... It's got the baby's name on so let's hope we don't change our minds now. 

'I love this little part of the room now, and love that my mum posted the Steiff teddy bear my Gran bought when I was born.

Comfort is key: The reality star credited her nursing bra for being 'EXCEPTIONALLY comfy' and claimed it helps alleviate nipple pain during the cold British weather

'It's in such good condition despite being over 30 years old because we come from a family where we keep good things "for good" so they never get used - anyone else relate?

'This bra is a nursing bra but is EXCEPTIONALLY comfy, and also has padding which helps with the nipple pain in the cold weather. It's from @bravadodesigns *gifted. Other than that it's just RIP to my belly button. #26weekspregnant #2ndtrimester.' 

Later on in the day, Ashley displayed her incredible curves in a pink snakeskin maxi-dress complete with a plunging neckline and waistband that rested above her bump. 

She styled her voluminous locks in a natural wavy 'do and opted for a makeup pallet of pink hues as she headed to a pelvic floor assessment in London.
