'I am 100% convinced that working out is part of what makes me so happy,' Lopez gushed to Hello! in 2016.

'Dance has always been a huge part of my life and taking the time to move my body and do something that's so good for me is key to my happiness.

'And I really believe that when you take care of yourself and work to stay healthy, you're better able to take care of those you love. So working out is definitely a priority for me.'

The former Fly Girl drinks lots of water and has a clean organic high-protein, nutrient-dense diet containing no caffeine or processed/refined foods.

Blended brood: It's hard to believe Lopez is mother to 12-year-old twins Max & Emme Muñiz, whom she raises with fiancé Alex Rodriguez and his two daughters (pictured September 7) 

I'm a very social person and love spending time with my friends and family, so when we go out to eat I try to make healthy choices,' JLo told the mag.

'Most restaurants offer healthy, low-calorie meals so I watch for things on the menu that fit my lifestyle. I'll have a salad or some fish with veggies. And I make sure I drink lots of water throughout the meal.'

It's hard to believe the Hustlers actress is mother to 12-year-old twins Max & Emme Muñiz (with ex-husband #3 Marc Anthony), whom she raises with fiancé Alex Rodriguez and his two daughters (with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis).

Following their March 9, 2019 engagement, Jennifer and the 45-year-old retired New York Yankee's long-delayed church nuptials have been 'on pause' due to the coronavirus pandemic.
