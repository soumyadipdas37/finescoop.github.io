She has been praised for expressing body positivity and sharing candid underwear snaps on Instagram. 

And Malin Andersson displayed her killer curves once more as she wore a plunging lace top for a night out in Manchester on Tuesday evening with her friend. 

The Love Island star, 27, exuded confidence as she sashayed through the city centre to make the most of a night out before the 10pm coronavirus curfew kicks in.

Her pal was seen wearing a chic floral wrap dress as they linked arms and began their girls night out. 

The recent outing comes after Malin put on a defiant display in navy lingerie on Instagram as she told fans she had 'finally realised my worth' after having her 'confidence stripped'.

The caption appeared to refer to her ex Tom, 29, who was jailed ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in Instagram posts last year, but her ex-boyfriend from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Malin and Tom had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter, Consy, was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.   

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief.

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety. The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
