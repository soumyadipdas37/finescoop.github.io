Lib Dem leader Ed Davey checks into our travel Q&A

This week Lib Dem leader Ed Davey checks into our travel Q&A.

He talks about his earliest travel memory, his favourite party conference town, the trip he took this summer - and more.

WHAT'S YOUR FIRST HOLIDAY MEMORY?

Going to Skegness in Lincolnshire — or Nottingham-by-the-Sea as we used to call it. We'd traipse there every summer to stay in my grandma's caravan.

ANY SPECIAL TEEN TRAVEL MEMORIES?

My parents had both died by the time I was 15. The year after Mum's death I organised an Interrail holiday around Europe with three schoolmates. We had a great time, even if we did have to sleep on the odd bench.

GO ANYWHERE NICE THIS SUMMER?

We had planned a trip to France but ended up staying with my mother-in-law near Blandford Forum in Dorset. The two kids loved it.

WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A HOLIDAY ?

It's all about the children these days. My son John is disabled and needs warm water for his muscles, so we sometimes visit Hungary, which, besides having a treatment centre in Budapest, has some super spas.

TIPS FOR VISITORS TO HUNGARY ?

Every Hungarian town seems to have a spa, and everyone goes and lets it all hang out — it's not seen as elitist. People even play chess in the warm waters.

FAVOURITE PLACE THERE?

The city of Orosháza has the most amazing indoor and outdoor spa complex with slides the kids just love. It's really off the beaten track.

HOLIDAY FROM HELL?

In Jersey, which is the loveliest island, as a boy. A kid at our hotel said: 'Everyone who stays here gets ill.' Lo and behold, days later we all had stomach upsets.

FAVOURITE PARTY CONFERENCE TOWN?

Harrogate... or York.

Ed says Jersey is the 'loveliest island' but that he had a holiday from hell there as a boy

EVER HAVE A DIP DURING CONFERENCE?

I take my trunks if it's at the seaside, but more in hope than in expectation...

NEXT FAMILY HOLIDAY?

France next summer, but I suspect it may be Dorset again — no bad thing.

DREAM DESTINATION?

New Zealand, driving a camper van around South Island with the family.
