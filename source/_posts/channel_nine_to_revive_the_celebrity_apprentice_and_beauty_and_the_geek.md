Channel Nine are reviving two iconic reality shows next year.

'Hosted by the original beautiful geek, Sophie Monk, this big-hearted program will showcase the power of love on the inside as a fresh group of beauties and geeks from all over the country test their brains and their charisma,' reads a press release. 

'The new Beauty and the Geek promises to deliver laughs, tears and everything in between as two groups of people from completely different worlds are set to collide.

'From the producers of ratings phenomenon Married at First Sight, Beauty and the Geek finds a new home on Nine with a rejuvenated and reimagined format as it explores the old saying that you can’t always judge a book by its cover.'

Beauty and the Geek previously aired on Channel Seven for six seasons from 2009 to 2014.

'In each episode two teams of celebrities will take on an epic task, using their business savvy, creativity and charm – while reaching into their little black book of contacts – to win cash for their chosen charities.'

Nine also promises that the new season will feature 'plenty of never-before-seen twists and tasks to keep viewers on the edge of their seats'.
