At least three small earthquakes rattled California on Tuesday for the second time in three days, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The USGS reported that a 2.7 magnitude earthquake with a depth of 4.5km hit Milpitas around 8.16am Tuesday morning. 

Ten minutes later, a 2.9 magnitude tremor with a depth of 4km hit the same area. 

The third quake struck around 9.02am with a magnitude of 3.3 and a depth of 4.3km.

Dozens of people in Fremont, Milpitas and San Jose felt the quakes, which occurred on the Calaveras fault system.

Elizabeth Cochran, a seismologist with USGS, explained to CBS that the back-to-back tremors are what experts call an 'earthquake swarm'.

'The Calaveras fault, in particular, has fairly frequent what we call "earthquake swarms." These are sets of events that are relatively low magnitude, where you have lots of events happening over a period of days to weeks.'

'If you have really weak material almost like talcum powder, talc, then you can get the fault moving, creeping along slowly instead of getting stuck and having a larger event,' Cochran added.

Shortly after Tuesday's quakes, people took to social media to react to the swarm of tremors. 

'For a region still dealing with: --COVID --Fires --Smokey skies for weeks It's no surprise we'd be wary of earthquakes,' one user tweeted. 

Another wrote: 'I’m not one to freak out over small earthquakes, but this is the 3rd or 4th small quake we’ve had in the South Bay since Sunday and ya girl is low-key scared.'

Just days before Tuesday's earthquakes, two small tremors struck Milpitas.  According to the USGS, a 3.4-magnitude quake with a depth of 5.3km hit around 3.54pm on Sunday. Hours later at 10.16pm, another 3.4-magnitude quake hit the area.

And on September 19, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake struck Southern California. 

The earthquake hit around 11.40pm, about 2 miles outside of South El Monte, near Los Angeles, the agency reported. Preliminary reports indicate it was about 11 miles deep.

Not to mention there were about 20 earthquakes reported in August alone. 

Last month, Google announced that Android phones will be used to sense earthquakes around the world and may one day be able to provide global warnings.

Google, which helped develop Android, worked with California and the USGS to build the quake alerts into all phones that run the commonplace mobile operating system. 

Android users who have enabled location services and are near a quake of magnitude 4.5 or greater will receive a full-screen earthquake warning telling them to drop to the floor and seek cover.

The screen also will provide estimates of the quake’s magnitude and distance from the user.

The alert is based on the projected shaking at a particular location and a certain level of intensity. Depending on their distance from a quake, people could get several seconds or perhaps a minute of warning.

The warnings are powered by California’s ShakeAlert system, which uses signals from more than 700 seismometers installed around the state that can sense seismic waves.

IPhone users won’t receive the alerts through Apple’s operating system, but they can download the MyShake app.

Meanwhile, California is also dealing with wildfires that have devoured parts of the state amid unseasonably hot and dry weather.

High winds that spread new fires this week in the Napa and Sonoma wine country and in a far northern area of the state were reduced to breezes, but vegetation remained ripe for burning in high temperatures amid very low humidity.

The National Weather Service said the weather conditions would last for several days due to high pressure centered over the state. 

Heat advisories were in effect or pending along about three-quarters of the California coast and many areas had poor air quality due to smoke.

Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas, especially because climate change has made California much drier. A drier California means plants are more flammable.

About 70,000 people were under evacuation orders in the wine region north of San Francisco where the Glass Fire has incinerated dozens of homes along with winery installations and other buildings.
