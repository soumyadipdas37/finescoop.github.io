PrettyLittleThing are looking for budding designers to create a capsule collection of 5-10 designers that will retail on the site.  

Molly-Mae tried on some designs while promoting the campaign as she was seen fixing her sleeves in a fitting room.

In one snap, the social media star let her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders while in another, she styled it into a chic updo. 

Entrants must submit 5-10 designs in a PDF. Sketches need to have a clear front and back view of each style and be relevant for a February launch, with a £20,000 prize up for grabs.

Molly-Mae took to her Instagram on Monday and shared a stunning snap of herself enjoying a glass of wine while in Milan.

The beauty opted for a casual look as she sported a white vest top along with a pair of blue jeans.  

It comes after Molly-Mae recently revealed that she was giving away a massive haul of goods – including Louis Vuitton bags – as she celebrated garnering 1million YouTube subscribers.

However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.

As the complaints ramped up on the micro-blogging site, the reality star and influencer clapped back, wryly tweeting: '£10 to any boy that’s not tweeted ‘£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae’s giveaway’..... terms and conditions apply x.'

However, on Saturday, Molly-Mae revealed that she'd all but given up on the platform, in a video shared with her fans on her Instagram Stories.

She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always.

'I'm one of those people that do tend to read things and I do tend to let it get to me.

'But I just made this giveaway for something for us all to enjoy together, a way that we can celebrate having a million subscribers together and also a way for me to give back was the main thing.

'I wouldn't have any of this stuff without you guys, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I do.

'Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.'

On initially announcing the competition, the blonde beauty wrote: 'I can’t put into words what this means to me. Since the age of 16 I’ve had this dream and goal in my mind and today we did it.... my mind is blown.

'Without you guys this dream would never have become a reality, so it’s only right that I give back. THIS IS MY CRAZY GIVEAWAY!!!! The thought of one of you receiving all of these things makes me so happy, I can’t wait to see who wins!

She concluded of the contest, which ends on September 20th: 'This giveaway is not a paid partnership or in any way an affiliation of any brands that are included. Everything included has been purchased by me for this giveaway for you all to enjoy.'
