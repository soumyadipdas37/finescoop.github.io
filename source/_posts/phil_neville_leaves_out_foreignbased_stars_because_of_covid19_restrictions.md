Coronavirus travel restrictions across Europe has seen Phil Neville leave a number of established England internationals out of his 30-woman squad for the Lionesses' September training camp. 

Such is the success of the England team, a number of Neville's regulars ply their trade across Europe, largely in France and in Spain, and it has proven costly during the Covid-19 shutdown. 

And restrictions on those countries with travel at the moment due to the global pandemic has seen Nikita Parris and Jodie Taylor (both at Lyon) and Toni Duggan (Atletico Madrid) omitted from Neville's latest squad.

Jodie Taylor, who won the Women's Champions League with Lyon last month, was also out

Neville selected 10 uncapped players for the intensive training camp which begins next week

In Madrid, where Duggan is based, a sudden spike in cases in recent weeks has seen social gatherings restricted with officials keen to get control of the virus once more, having loosened rules after a strict initial quarantine period in Spain. 

Almost a third of Spain's new cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Madrid. 

France saw a record daily peak of 8,975 more infections and while the country is determined not to return to a second lockdown, international travel has been restricted which affects Parris and Taylor in particular. 

Parris, who also won the UWCL with Lyon, is a regular for England but is not in the latest squad

Duggan is based in Madrid and there has been a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases there

A 14-day quarantine is required for any travellers entering the UK from France under the government's guidelines right now. 

Parris, Taylor and Duggan had all been in San Sebastian, Spain, for the conclusion of the Women's Champions League last month, eventually won by Lyon. 

Bronze, who announced she had left Lyon for Manchester City on Tuesday, was included in the group of 30.  

With Neville overlooking a number of his regulars he selected 10 previously uncapped players for the squad.  

Lotte Wubben-Moy, Millie Turner, Esme Morgan, Ella Toone, Niamh Charles, Katie Zelem and Rinsola Babajide are all among those to get their first taste of the Lionesses' set-up.

The intensive training camp for Neville's camp at St George's Park begins next Tuesday with an 11-a-side behind-closed-doors match on the Friday of the week.

Manchester United's Katie Zelem has also been brought into the fold for this training camp

'This is a critical moment in our development of England Women,' Neville said. 

'Every camp from now on is aimed at building a team capable of competing for the highest honours in world football. All the youngsters who have been given their opportunity today are extremely deserving of their senior call-ups, having performed strongly at club level and through England's development teams. 

'Now is their opportunity to prove themselves at senior international level and I am excited to see the blend of youthful ambition and senior experience.'

England's next competitive match is away against Germany on October 27.
