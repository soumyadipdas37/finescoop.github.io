American Horror Story star Emma Roberts showcased her burgeoning bump in a grey patterned maternity midi-dress while stopping for Starbucks in Los Angeles' Los Feliz neighborhood on Tuesday.

The expecting 29-year-old accessorized her daytime attire with dark sunglasses, black patent-leather Mary Jane loafers, and a matching purse.

Emma made sure to protect herself and others from COVID-19 by wearing a pink cloth mask, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for all public outings on June 18.

As of Tuesday, there have been over 254K confirmed coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 6,232 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

Roberts officially confirmed she and Dirt Music heartthrob Garrett Hedlund were expecting their first child - a son - in an August 30 Instagram post.

The parents-to-be reportedly began their romance the same month (March 2019) she split from her on/off fiancé, Evan Peters, after seven years.

But it was Emma's mother Kelly Cunningham who first spilled the beans via Instagram confirming on June 25 that she was 'very excited' to become a grandmother on her since-deleted account.

Roberts appears to have no relationship with her Oscar-nominated father Eric, who was reportedly embroiled in a bitter custody battle with Kelly.

The Hunt actress' street sighting came two weeks after she and Bellatrist co-curator Karah Preiss signed a first-look TV producing deal with Hulu, according to THR.

Emma and Karah will solely focus on adaptations of books - starting with Carola Lovering's 2018 novel Tell Me Lies with Meaghan Oppenheimer (Queen America) penning the script.

Acting-wise, Roberts next portrays Sloane in John Whitesell's holiday rom-com Holidate, which starts streaming October 28 on Netflix.

The McG-produced flick about 'two single people agreeing to be each other's plus ones each holiday' also features Frances Fisher, Kristin Chenoweth, Alex Moffat, and Luke Bracey.
