She's been maintaining her slimmed-down figure ever since she shed two stone in 2018.

And Kerry Katona kept up with her healthy lifestyle as she shared an image following her workout with her new fiancé Ryan Mahoney onto Instagram on Monday.

The former Atomic Kitten star, 40, showed off her impressive midsection as she slipped into a sporty crop top emblazoned with the personal trainer's M-FIT brand logo.

Putting her enviable figure on full display, the singer teamed her bralet with a pair of matching shorts.

The mother-of-five let her skin breathe as she went make-up free during her exercise session. 

A grateful Kerry captioned her snap: 'Thank you @mfitofficial for today!!! Absolutely loved the work out.' (sic)

Earlier this month, Kerry and Ryan, 31, shared more details of their romantic Spanish engagement. 

The fitness guru proposed to the reality star last month during a holiday in Spain, with the blessing of her five children - Molly, 18, Lilly, 17, Heidi, 13, Max, 12, and DJ, six. 

Appearing on Loose Women, the television personality, who has been married three times, gave her first TV interview since their shock announcement.

Speaking about telling her brood before getting down on one knee, Ryan explained: 'I thought it was the right thing to do.

'Everyone was excited, everyone was on board. It was lovely in that respect. I went to pick the ring with DJ and Heidi. I think Max was asleep at the time.'  

Kerry said she couldn't believe DJ didn't tell her. 'For a six year old, she did really well. Crafty that one, I'll watch out for her!' she laughed.

Carol McGiffin then asked Ryan what he would have done if the kids had said no and Ryan revealed: 'If it was the youngest three, I would have brainwashed them with a McDonald's, the older two, harder work.

'But yeah, I don't know really. I get along so well with them all so I kind of knew it was going to work… I'm really happy about it.'

Discussing why this marriage will be different, Kerry said: 'Before, it's always been about a wedding, I don't want a wedding, I want a marriage. Ryan's my partner, my life partner. I feel like this is how it should have been the first time and second… and third time around!.

 'The past is the past. Just because I've been married and divorced and I've got five kids with three dads, doesn't mean I don't deserve to be happy… I'm really happy and I'm in love.'  

For Kerry, this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay.   

In an interview with New Magazine, the couple hinted they could well tie the knot in a Las Vegas wedding. 

Showing his apparent aversion to lavish nuptials, Ryan said: 'To me, weddings have always been overrated. I've never been a fan of the big, white wedding. 

'I always knew if I was going to do it, I'd want to hop on a plane and do it in Vegas in a chilled-out way.'
