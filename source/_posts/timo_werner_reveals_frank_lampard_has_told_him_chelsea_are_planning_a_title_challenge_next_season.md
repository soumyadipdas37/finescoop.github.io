Timo Werner has opened up on his start to life at Chelsea and revealed that Frank Lampard's side are gearing up for a title challenge next season.

The striker made the move from RB Leipzig to Stamford Bridge in a £53million deal earlier this summer and scored in Chelsea's pre-season friendly inside just four minutes against Brighton last weekend.

Lampard has strengthened his side this summer with the likes of Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva joining Werner at the club.

Chelsea finished in the top four last term but Werner has conceded that the Blues are targeting challenging reigning champions Liverpool and Pep Guardiola's Manchester City for the Premier League trophy.

'He's [Lampard's] been great to work with and he's been discussing his plans for the future, and how we want to battle with teams like Man City and Liverpool,' he told the club's official website.

'I think Chelsea is a big club and with this team that we have, I think we can reach a new level.

'My apartment is very nice, I feel happy there and also the city of London is brilliant. For me, London is one of the best cities in the world so I'm really happy.'

Werner is currently on international duty with Germany before linking back up with Chelsea before their 2020-21 campaign starts on September 14 at Brighton.

The 24-year-old has revealed that he is adapting to life in England. 'When I first came to England it was hard to understand everyone's English because I haven't had to speak this language since my school days. It's not been as hard as I expected though, everyone has helped me settle in,' he added. 

'People have spoken very slowly so I can understand and right now I feel very happy. I can understand everything and communicate in English.'
