A slew of Love Islanders hit London town on Friday night. 

Eve Gale, 21, turned heads as she strutted through Mayfair to Amazonico with twin sister Jess, Joanna Chimonides, 23, and Francesca Allen, 24. 

The reality star showed off her ample cleavage and a hint of her toned waist in a ribbed bandeau crop top, which she teamed with figure-hugging white jeans.

It comes after Jess and Eve recently returned from a sun-soaked getaway to the Greek island of Mykonos.

The pair shared a number of jaw-dropping bikini snaps from their break as they enjoyed the island holiday. 

Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched, 23, during the pandemic.  

It's been reported that lockdown made it impossible for the couple to 'build a relationship' as they were unable to meet up with one another. 

In a statement shared with MailOnline, the blonde beauty confirmed the COVID-19 lockdown played a role in the demise of their romance, but insisted they continue to be friends.

Heartache: Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched, 23, during the pandemic 

The statement read: 'After a whirlwind romance in the Love Island villa, unfortunately Jessica Gale and Ched Uzor have made the mutual decision to split.

'They have unfortunately felt the effects of lockdown separation but will continue as friends. 

'They wish nothing but the best for each other and full success in each others careers.' 

Jess and Ched are the latest couple from this year's inaugural winter season of Love Island to part ways, with Luke Mabbott and Demi revealing their split last month.
