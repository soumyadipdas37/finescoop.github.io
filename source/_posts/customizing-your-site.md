excerpt: HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS? About 14 per cent of people who contract the COVID-19 coronavirus are taken to hospital – with severe symptoms including breathing problems and pneumonia. About 5 per cent need intensive care. But the majority who get the virus suffer nothing more than a cough and may never know they are infected. So far, thousands of people around the world have already recovered from coronavirus – and that just includes the numbers who received a diagnosis.
