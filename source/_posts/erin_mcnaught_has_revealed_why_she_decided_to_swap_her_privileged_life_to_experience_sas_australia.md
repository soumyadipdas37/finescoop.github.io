She's the former Miss Universe Australia who juggles her modeling and acting career with raising two young boys.

And now, Erin McNaught has revealed why she decided to swap her 'privileged life' to experience Channel Seven's military-style show SAS Australia.

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph this week, she said: 'It's certainly the toughest test I've ever undertaken. No amount of training can prepare you for it.'

The 38-year-old model explained that she did the show for two reasons.

'I feel like I've led a very lucky, privileged life, having never experienced severe hardship or tragedy,' she said.

Erin then explained the next reason was because she felt it was important to 'experience some of the suffering the veterans made for our freedom'.

The mother-of-two explained: 'The second reason was to show my boys that women and mums can do anything they put their minds to.'

She then added that she hopes her sons Ennio and Evander form relationships with girls/women based on strength of character. 

Last month, Erin shocked her followers when she showed off her bruised and battered body after filming the reality competition.

The model shared a topless selfie with a series of painful-looking bruises scattered across one of her arms, her ribcage and her chest.

Erin revealed she acquired the bruises when her 'jump out of a helicopter' went 'wrong'. 

SAS will follow 14 celebrities as they attempt the intense selection process for the elite Special Forces army unit.

Under the guidance of former Special Forces soldiers, they will have to endure both physical and psychological challenges.
