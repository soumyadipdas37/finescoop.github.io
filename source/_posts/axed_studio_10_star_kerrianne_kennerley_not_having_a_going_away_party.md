Kerri-Anne Kennerley was one of 25 employees to be sacked from Channel Ten as a cost-cutting measure last month. 

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph's Confidential on Monday, the 66-year-old veteran journalist revealed she's leaving Studio 10 this week without any fanfare.

'I'm not having a going away party or anything like that,' she said.

Last month, Channel Ten made 25 employees redundant, including Kerri-Anne, newsreader Natarsha Belling and weatherman Tim Bailey.   

On a recent episode of Studio 10, Kerri-Anne fought back tears as she acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic had made it necessary to tighten the budget.   

She also thanked her friends and colleagues for their support.

'I just know I'm back on the "lazy Susan" of television. Yeah, it's very, very tough for a lot of people,' she said on-air. 

On Saturday, it was announced Tristan MacManus will join Sarah Harris as co-host on Studio 10.

The Dancing With The Stars judge, 38, will appear on the revamped program as of September 14.

Tristan and Sarah will be joined by news reporter Narelda Jacobs, entertainment reporter Angela Bishop, and contributors Denise Drysdale, Jono Coleman and Craig Bennett. 

Joe Hildebrand recently revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show that he has been offered 'a new role' and is in talks with the network about 'what that might be'. 

Tristan said of his new role in an official statement: 'Although people know me as a dancer, I think my mouth usually works better than my feet do.

'This opportunity came out of the blue and I'm really excited to be working with Sarah and learning from her,' the father-of-two continued.
