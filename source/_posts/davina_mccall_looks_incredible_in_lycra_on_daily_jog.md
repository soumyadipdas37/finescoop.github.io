She's passionate about health and fitness and Davina McCall was out enjoying her daily jog in a country park in Kent on Thursday morning. 

The 52-year-old mother-of-three displayed her gym-honed body as she worked up a sweat wearing an all-grey ensemble. 

She teamed a light sweater with colourblock leggings and trainers, later whipping off her top to reveal a matching vest top. 

You go, girl! Davina McCall, 52, looked incredible in lycra on her daily jog in Kent on Thursday after declaring 'women over 50 can still enjoy orgasms' in an impassioned interview

The outing comes after Davina talked about feeling confident sexually, saying that 'women over 50 can still enjoy orgasms.' 

She told Women's Health: 'I don't look as good naked as I did in my twenties. But I feel better, and that's the difference.

'I walk around like a foxy minx now because I feel like a foxy minx. Women over 50 feel sexy, we can dress sexily and we can wear underwear and we still enjoy orgasms...

She said: 'I walk around like a foxy minx now because I feel like a foxy minx. Women over 50 feel sexy, we can dress sexily and we can wear underwear and we still enjoy orgasms...'

'People say, "Oh, it's all gone…menopause…you're finished with your wizened, dried-up ovaries." I feel like it's really important to say that people in their fifties are having the time of their lives.'

The podcast host also revealed she had her nipple re-pierced after first having it done when she was aged 24 or 25

Davina split from from husband Matthew Robertson in 2017 after 17 years together, and is now dating her longtime friend Michael Douglas.  

She is mother to Holly, 18, Tilly, 16 and Chester, 13, from her former marriage.

Davina has just returned from a family trip to France and spent lockdown self-isolating with her children in their West Sussex home.

The Making the Cut podcast presenter had been making the best of the extra time at home by varying her fitness regime and avoiding processed foods.
