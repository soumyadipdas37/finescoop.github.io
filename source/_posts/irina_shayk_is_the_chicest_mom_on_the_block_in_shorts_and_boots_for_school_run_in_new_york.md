She's known to command attention on any runway.

And Irina Shayk turned an ordinary New York City street into her own catwalk while on the morning school run with her daughter Lea on Thursday.

The 34-year-old supermodel put her incredible figure on display in a pair of shorts and boots while making her way through Manhattan.

Irina's tanned and toned legs were on display in a shorts romper which featured a low cut neckline.

She stayed warm in the brisk autumn weather with a matching duster which draped down to her calves.

The Russian born beauty added inches to her statuesque frame with a pair of knee-high black leather boots.

The 34-year-old supermodel put her incredible figure on display in a pair of shorts and boots while making her way through Manhattan.

She carried a brown-and-white zebra striped purse across one shoulder and wore rectangular sunglasses.

Irina slicked back her dark brown hair and wore a black face covering to protect herself and others from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

Lea looked completely content in her stroller while sporting a baby pink ballerina ensemble with matching shoes.

Hard at work: Next up for the supermodel is a starring role in Rihanna's Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2, which premieres on Amazon Oct. 2

Shayk split from Lea's father, Bradley Cooper, in June 2019 after nearly four years together. 

Irina was certainly enjoying time with her daughter after landing back stateside following a whirlwind trip to Italy for Milan Fashion Week.

Next up for the supermodel is a starring role in Rihanna's Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2, which premieres on Amazon Oct. 2.

She'll storm the runway alongside Demi Moore, Bella Hadid, Cara Delevingne and Lizzo, with performances by Travis Scott, Rosalia, Miguel, Mustard, Roddy Rich and Ella Mai.
