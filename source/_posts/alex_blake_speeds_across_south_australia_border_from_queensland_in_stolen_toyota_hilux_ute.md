A man wanted in Queensland is on the run in South Australia after evading a border checkpoint.

Police say Alex Blake and a woman are travelling in a stolen car and believed to have a gun.

They crossed into SA on Monday afternoon in a white Toyota HiLux ute that was stolen from a Queensland address on Sunday.

Police allege the ute was involved in a petrol drive-off at Innamincka on Monday and also drove at speed towards a man in the town.

The pair were later spotted at Hawker, in SA's mid-north and then at Port Augusta.

Anyone spotting the car or Blake and his companion should not approach them, but call police.
