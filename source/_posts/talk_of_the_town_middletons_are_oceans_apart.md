I bet Pippa Middleton is green with envy after seeing this snap posted on Instagram of her brother James and fiancee Alizee Thevenet sailing off Sicily.

While James and Alizee were enjoying the Italian sunshine, Pippa, hubby James Matthews and toddler son Arthur had to cope with changeable British weather as they chartered a boat to the Channel Islands.

They were forced to scrap their getaway to the Caribbean island of St Barts, where James’s family have a luxury resort, due to Covid restrictions.

But fret not. I hear the happy couple maintained their usual high standards by dining on lobster and champagne.

The couple have managed to avoid the Covid lockdown by remaining in Italy 

And while on holiday have posted a series of photographs outlining their trip on Instagram

One famous face who won’t be munching critters on this year’s I’m A Celebrity is Martin Kemp.

I hear the 58-year-old Spandau Ballet star, whose son Roman finished third on last year’s series, was being badgered mercilessly by producers to take part. 

My mole says: ‘Martin could have written his own cheque but did not fancy it.’ 

Nothing to do with the fact this year celebs will miss out on the all-expenses-paid trip to sunny Oz and have to do with a rain-soaked castle in Wales instead?
