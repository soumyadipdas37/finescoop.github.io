All pet lovers know their furry friends can be naughty at times, but these cats and canines have left their owners despairing by wreaking havoc on their homes. 

Samuel, from Sittingbourne, Kent, managed to beat a pot-smashing tortoise called Timothy and plenty of furniture chewing dogs, to take home the winning title in a competition run by furniture company ScS, to find the UK's ten most destructive pets.

The three-year-old Cocker Spaniel knocked a can of blue paint down the stairs and all over owner Zara Angelova's cream carpet.

A hilarious photo of the pup shows him looking very sorry for himself as he showcases his 'artistic skills' on the cream carpet.

Zara said: 'I’d just finished painting an old chest of drawers and foolishly left the open pot at the top of the stairs because I heard my phone ringing. Samuel followed me down the stairs and, in doing so, knocked over the pot.
