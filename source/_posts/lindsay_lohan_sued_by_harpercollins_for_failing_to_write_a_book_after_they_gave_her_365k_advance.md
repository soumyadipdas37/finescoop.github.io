Lindsay Lohan is reportedly being sued by publishing company HarperCollins for failing to write a book despite being paid a handsome advance to do so. 

HarperCollins claim that Lohan, 34, breached a contract that she signed with them in March 2014, with a promise to turn in the title - rumored to be a tell-all biography - by May 2015, which never materialized. 

In legal documents filed by the publishing house, they claim Lohan was given a revised date of March 2017 to get it finished, and that they even paid her an advance of $365k against future royalties, TMZ reports.

DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for the Mean Girls star, who has so far been unavailable for comment.

Legal documents obtained by the site reportedly say that HarperCollins told Lohan the deal was off in September of 2018, and asked for their money back. 

However, Lohan allegedly never returned the funds she received. The Parent Trap star is being sued for the $365k advance, as well as interest and legal charges.

In 2014, it was reported that Lohan was set to sign a staggering $1 million deal to write her memoir for HarperCollins. 

The news came after Lohan spent time in rehab 2013, and reportedly kept a much-discussed diary, where she allegedly wrote a list of the famous men she had slept with.

'It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of sample pages,' a source told PageSix at the time. 

No comment: Lindsay, 34, has yet to respond to the claim by HarperCollins 

In 2014, during an appearance on - where else - but Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live, Lohan spoke about her list of lovers, which must have clearly caught the attention of the publishing industry. 

InTouch weekly had published a hand-written list of famous men that Lohan allegedly slept with, and referring to the photo she said: 'That was actually my fifth step in AA at Betty Ford.'

'And someone, when I was moving during the OWN show, must have taken a photo of it. And so that's a really personal thing and it's really unfortunate…'
