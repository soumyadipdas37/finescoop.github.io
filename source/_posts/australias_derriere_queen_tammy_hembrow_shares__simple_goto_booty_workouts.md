She has been accused of having butt implants in the past, a rumour she has long since denied.  

And fitness entrepreneur Tammy Hembrow showed just how much work it takes to (naturally) achieve her famous rounded backside on Tuesday. 

The fitness entrepreneur, from Queensland's Gold Coast, uploaded three signature 'booty burners' to Instagram to encourage her followers on their fitness journey. 

No fake booty here! Tammy Hembrow has shared the simple workout to get her famous backside after being accused of having butt implants 

The blonde bombshell could be seen squatting with a secret weapon to make the most of her workout - the booty band. 

The grey strap was wrapped around the outer middle-part of Tammy's thighs while she did squats and lunges.

The resistance band works by providing external resistance - making it harder for muscles to work against and complete the movement.

While the mother-of-two does not appear to struggle in the videos, her facial expressions tell the audience otherwise.

She was seen gripping her hands together while scrunching up her face as she moved through each rep.

'Make sure you save these booty burners for later,' she encouraged her followers on the Tammy Hembrow Fitness account. 

'If you haven't already for the TF booty bands, get in quickkkk.'

She then went on to demonstrate how to use the bands for side-to-side squats.

Tammy was seen holding two large dumbbells in the second video while sporting barely-there black shorts and an almost see-through sports bra with 'Honey' on the front. 

She methodically breathed through each rep while looking away from the camera, before moving onto laying hip thrust in the third video.

This simple exercise, which anybody can do from the comfort of their own home, is good for improving strength, stabilising the core and growing glutes.  

Tammy has long been determined to shut down critics who have accused her of getting implants and injections to achieve her bottom.

'Das a 100% natural booty,' she wrote on Instagram in October last year, in response to a fan who had asked if she'd had a Brazilian butt lift.

Brazilian butt lifts involve removing fat from other areas of the body with liposuction, and then injecting it into the bottom.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan in August 2018, Tammy revealed she had always been on the skinny side.

But she said she discovered she could mold her body into the shape she wanted simply by building muscle.

'I think people see my photos and think it may have happened overnight,' she told the publication of transforming her body.

'It was not a quick process.'

Tammy revealed she hits the gym four times a week for gruelling workouts, and spends three of those sessions focusing on her lower body.

She said diet also plays a massive part in building up mass around her bottom.

'It's more frustrating than anything because I don't want people to think they can't achieve a booty with hard work,' she told Cosmopolitan of accusations her bottom is fake.

'It just creates a false mindset that it's not achievable and surgery is the only option, which is completely wrong.'
