He's one of Hollywood's rare triple threat performers, known for his talent in acting, singing and dancing. 

And Hugh Jackman looked like he could break into a musical performance at any moment as he sashayed down the streets of Soho, New York, with a cane and boater hat on Sunday. 

The Australian star, 51, clutched the flamboyant accessories and a black leather tote bag in one hand as he strolled down the bustling sidewalk.  

Still the greatest showman! Hugh Jackman, 51, looked ready to perform as he stepped out with a cane and boater hat in Soho, New York, on Sunday 

In the other hand, Hugh held a plastic protein shaker bottle.  

Covering up his famous face with a mask, the Greatest Showman star wore a black jumper, camel-coloured trousers and black-and-white sneakers.  

He shielded himself from the autumnal sun with a black baseball cap. 

Just the essentials? The Australian star, 51, clutched the flamboyant accessories and a black leather tote bag in one hand as he strolled down the bustling sidewalk

It comes as Hugh celebrates an Emmy win for his latest film, Bad Education. 

The lauded television drama won a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie on Saturday. 

Hugh was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Limited Series Or Movie, but lost out to Mark Ruffalo for his performance in I Know This Much Is True.

Hmm! It's unclear why Hugh chose to carry the eye-catching cap and cane 

Despite losing out, Hugh has received wide praise from fans and critics alike for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in Bad Education, with many calling it the actor's best performance yet. 

In an interview with Variety, Hugh described the opportunity to portray real-life school superintendent Frank Tassone as 'fascinating'.       

'The role itself was something different from what I've done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community - and fell down this slippery path,' he said.

And he described playing the villain as 'delicious' during an interview with Collider. 

'As an actor, it just had so much to play with, and so many things that I've never really had the opportunity to play with. He's seemingly very charming, but also just a viper... Those things, I just found really exciting to play,' he said.   

Bulking up? Hugh also carried a plastic protein shaker bottle in his other hand
