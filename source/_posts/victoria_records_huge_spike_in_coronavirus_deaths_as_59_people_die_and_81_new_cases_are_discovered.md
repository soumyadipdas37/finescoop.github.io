Victoria has announced a record 59 coronavirus deaths, the state's highest tally so far.

But not all the deaths occurred in the last 24 hours.

The new deaths come as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks.

A top secret draft for the city's exit road map has revealed the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks.

While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage Four restrictions.

‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’ 

According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.

Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.
