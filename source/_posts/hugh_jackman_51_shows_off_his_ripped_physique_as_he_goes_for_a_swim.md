He may have retired his beloved role of Wolverine.

But Hugh Jackman is still in incredible superhero shape.

The Aussie actor, 51, showed off his ripped physique as he went shirtless for a swim in the Hamptons over the weekend.

Hugh went for a dip after taking his beloved dogs, Allegra and Dali, out for a walk near his family home in the upscale celebrity enclave.

He showed off his bulging biceps and abs in a pair of ocean-themed boardshorts as he dried off.

Earlier, Hugh, who has had basal cell carcinoma on his face six times, made sure to stay sun smart in a cowboy hat.

Hugh's wife Deborra-lee Furness recently revealed how she and her husband kept occupied while in lockdown with their family during the pandemic.

In an interview on Georgie Gardner's Drive podcast, Deborra-lee said the couple start each morning by reading together for half an hour.

'We read something of substance, so it sets you up for the day and we have a bit of a debate,' she explained.

'We [also] do meditation, we walk the dogs, we work out and then we start our day. It gives you a structure to hold on to.'

Deborra-lee also revealed Hugh has been baking everyday during lockdown, saying: 'He's a big baker. It's his new passion. He bakes literally every day.'

Hugh and Deborra-lee share their daughter Ava, 15, and son Oscar, 20.

Last month, Hugh also revealed being able to reconnect with his family was the one upside of the global health crisis.

'It's re-calibrated what is important,' the Wolverine star told ET Canada.

He continued: 'In many ways that has been a bonus. The silver lining has been quality time that I thought wouldn't happen again.'

The Greatest Showman star said he and his family were keeping occupied by doing puzzles together, playing games, watching movies and baking.

Hugh added that he was also able to finish watching Stranger Things, Succession and Ozark on Netflix with his 15-year-old daughter, Ava.
