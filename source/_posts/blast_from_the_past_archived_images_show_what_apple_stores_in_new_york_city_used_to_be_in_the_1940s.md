New York City is home to seven Apple Stores, but decades before the Apple icon hung on each building, they were shops, warehouses and even a post office.

The city’s Municipal Archives has a trove of photos taken of all five boroughs for a project during 1939 and 1941, revealing a world before iPhones and Genius Bars took over the city.

Some locations are unchanged from the original structure, while others can only be identified by street signs. 

The Soho location resembles that of the US postal office that once filled the interior, but the 'Cube' on Fifth Avenue has completely changed the landscape.

The exterior echoes that of the 1940s service facility, still with ‘Station A’ hanging over the doorway. However, at the corner of the building now hangs the small Apple icon

New York City’s Municipal Archives conducted a massive survey by taking photos of every single building that stood in all five boroughs, as first reported on by 9to5Mac.

The black and white images show the city's history before the large skyscrapers clouded views, traffic jams filled the streets and Apple Stores renovated charming buildings.

At 767 Fifth Avenue is a large, glass cube (left)  that acts as an entry to an underground Apple store. It is located adjacent to a General Motors building, which was once where the Savoy-Plaza Hotel stood (left)

New York’s meatpacking district is lined with warehouses (left) that have been converted into restaurants, bars and an Apple store.

However, at the corner of the building now hangs the small Apple icon.

In 2012, the location did a $20 million renovation that increased the interior by 5,000 square feet.

When it came to construction of the Fifth Avenue location, Apple did not renovate a building – it added a completely new structure.

At 767 Fifth Avenue is a large, glass cube that acts as an entry to an underground Apple store.

It is located adjacent to a General Motors building, which was once where the Savoy-Plaza Hotel stood.

The charming hotel was much smaller when it first opened its doors in 1892, just 12 stories, but after a new owner invested $30 million dollars into the building it grew to 33 floors.

It was demolished in 1965 and replaced by the General Motors building three years later.

Located at 401 W 14th Street is the tech giant’s store, which opened in 2007, in what appears to be one of those renovated facilities.

However, the streets still show sings of the towering tracks that ended service in 1940.

Take a trip back in time while standing at 1981 Broadway and you may not know where you are.

Sixty years ago, a classic movie theater brought in the crowds and today, people from all over come to purchase the latest iOS gadgets.

The location was once home to the Alden Theater, which opened in 1931, but was purchased by the Regency Theater after 68 years of operation -it was later torn down and replaced with the structure seen today.

Nestled inside Grand Central Station is another Apple Store and although New York’s Municipal did not capture what was once there, the images from 1941 are without stairs leading to the glowing Apple icon.

The staircase was not installed until 1995, but mirrors the West Stairs on the opposite end of the station.

The address of 940 Madison Avenue previously belonged to the US Mortgage Trust Company, which was completed in 1922, but was eventually replaced with the Chemical Bank &amp; Trust Company (left). The building appears to look as it did, but is now waving a flag with Apple’s logo in front (right)

Apple took over another former government building for its Upper East Side store.

Head over to Queens and the area is completely different today than it was in the 1940s.

Head over to Queens and the area is completely different today than it was in the 1940s - there was a single Sunoco station on the land (left). Today sites the Queens Center with a number of stores including Apple's (right)

Where the Apple Queens Center sits was once a small Sunoco gas station, which was the first building constructed at the corner of 59th Avenue and 92nd Street.

The early image of 247 Bedford Avenue shows what is now the corner of the Apple Williamsburg store near a corner light post.

The original building, which is unknown, was torn down before Apple’s late CEO Steve Jobs was tinkering with ideas for the first iPhone.

Apple opened a store inside World Trade Center (right)  in 2016, but before any of those buildings stood tall, the area was home to the city’s own Nedick’s (left) – an American fast-food chain was started in Manhattan in 1913

The small luncheonette, tuxedo rental shop and personal loan company are long gone at 123 Flatbush Avenue (left). Now, in their place is as stunning, glass walled Apple store (right)

Westfield World Trade Center and the Oculus are new additions to New York City, as they were constructed following the 9/11 attacks.

Apple opened a store inside World Trade Center in 2016, but before any of those buildings stood tall, the area was home to the city’s own Nedick’s – an American fast-food chain was started in Manhattan in 1913.

The streets surrounding the Downtown Brooklyn store resemble the scene form the 1940s, with its triangular formation that was once small shops in a highly-trafficked area.

However, the small luncheonette, tuxedo rental shop and personal loan company are long gone and in their place is as stunning, glass walled Apple store.
