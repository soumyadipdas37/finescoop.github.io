She reunited with her ex Bradley Cooper and their little girl Lea De Seine in public for the first time in a year following their split on Tuesday.

And following their outing, Irina Shayk looked radiant as she stepped out in SoHo, New York, with their daughter later in the day.

The model, 34, cut a typically stylish figure in a leopard print green slip dress, which she teamed with a pair of strappy nude sandals.

She accessorised her daytime look with a pair of chic rectangular shades and a selection of necklaces, as well as a pair of delicate earrings.

Irina and Bradley's little girl Lea, three, wore a navy and pink star print dress with a pair of Veja trainers.

The mother-of-one looked glowing as she showcased her natural good looks by going make-up free, while wearing her brunette locks in loose curls.

The mother and daughter were seen hopping into a black 4x4, which had been parked at the side of the street.

Earlier in the day, the Victoria's Secret Angel and her ex-husband, 45, were spotted in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City as their daughter Lea sat in a stroller. 

The Oscar winner was seen giving the catwalk expert a close hug on a sidewalk before he doted on his little girl.

The former power couple started dating in April 2015 when they attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, went official in March 2016 during a Paris Fashion Week party, welcomed Lea in March 2017 and split in June 2019.

They were last seen in February arm in arm at the British Vogue and Tiffany & Co. celebrate Fashion and Film Party at Annabel’s.

The two share custody of Lea who is seen often with both mom and dad in New York City. But seeing all three together is a rarity.

In January Irina touched on her relationship with Bradley when she sat down with Harper's Bazaar magazine.  

'I think in all good relationships you bring your best and your worst  - it's just the nature of a human being,' Shayk said. 'Two great people don't have to make a good couple.'

But she noted that she appreciated their union. 

'I think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other,' continued the model. 'Life without B is new ground.'
