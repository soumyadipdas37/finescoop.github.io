Sunrise host Sam Armytage celebrated her 44th birthday on Friday - but she didn't seem too happy about it.

After filming the live breakfast show, the crew at Sydney's Martin Place headquarters surprised Sam with cupcakes.

Despite the kind gesture from her colleagues, Sam didn't exactly look thrilled.

Sam was probably very grateful for the cupcakes, but it seems she was caught at a rather stressful moment.

The Weight Watchers ambassador looked chic in a red shift dress, and styled her blonde hair in loose waves and a slightly off-centre parting.

She opted for a simple makeup look comprising a flawless complexion, a hint of blush on her cheeks and a matte pink lipstick.

Here you go, boss! As she removed the microphone from her collar, a production assistant arrived with an assortment of cupcakes on a three-tier stand

In addition to the sweet treats, she also received a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

Sam's birthday celebration comes after she announced her engagement to horse breeder Richard Lavender in June.

At the time, she said that Richard had proposed on the spur of the moment 'weeks' earlier in the paddock of his rural property in the NSW Southern Highlands.

Sam explained they'd held back making the announcement because they were waiting for the personalised ring to arrive.

A jeweller from House of K'dor estimated that the cushion-cut sparkler Richard gave Sam cost him about $80,000. 

Sam and Richard, who began dating in April last year after meeting at a friend's party, confirmed their romance in November.
