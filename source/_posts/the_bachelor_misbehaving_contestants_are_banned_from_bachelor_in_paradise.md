It's no secret that Bachelor contestants must sign strict contracts before appearing on the Channel 10 dating show.

And it seems the network and producers Warner Bros. have a rather effective way of ensuring that the show's participants abide by the rules.

A contestant, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Daily Mail Australia she was told she would have 'no chance' of appearing on Bachelor in Paradise if she broke her contract.

'They said to me: "If you do this, you might as well rule out any future appearance on any other Warner Bros. show,"' the source claimed.

Locky Gilbert's contestants were warned not to speak to any magazine, website or podcast about their experiences during filming without the written permission of Warner Bros. 

They were also told their social media posts had to be approved by producers.

'If you are caught posting something they don't like, you have to delete it immediately,' the insider added.

The source continued: 'They continually remind you of your signed agreement and ask if you want to return for Bachelor in Paradise.

'We have a bit more freedom once we are get kicked off the show.' 

The production team also closely monitors the social media accounts of each of the finalists to make sure they don't leak spoilers - either deliberately or by accident.

Another bugbear for producers is staged paparazzi photos.

'Warner Bros. also really frown upon contestants setting up paparazzi photos... It's a big no-no,' the contestant said. 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10

Don't do it, ladies! Another bugbear for producers is staged paparazzi photos. The contestant said, 'Warner Bros. really frown upon contestants setting up paparazzi photos. It's a big no-no'
