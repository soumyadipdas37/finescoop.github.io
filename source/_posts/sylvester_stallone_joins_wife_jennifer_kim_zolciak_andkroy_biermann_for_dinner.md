Sylvestor Stallone and his family headed out for dinner with the Zolciak-Biermann's in Santa Monica on Thursday night.

The actor, 74, looked dapper in a leather jacket as he arrived at Fia Restaurant holding hands with wife Jennifer Flavin, 52. 

Meanwhile, Kim Zolciak, 42, flashed her abs and ample cleavage as she opted to go braless in a plunging orange satin crop top.

Kim teamed the look with high-waisted denim ripped jeans and a white clutch bag.

The television personality was joined by husband Kroy Biermann, 35, and her daughter Brielle, 23.   

Also joining the families for dinner was Sylvester's model daughter Sistine, 22.

The two families have been friends for years and they certainly seemed in high spirits as they posed for a group picture. 

Last month, the actor confirmed he's currently working on a director's cut of Rocky IV to mark the sports drama's upcoming anniversary on November 27.

'For the 35th anniversary Rocky 4 Is getting a new DIRECTORS cut by me,' he wrote in an Instagram post along with an image of Rocky facing-off with his Soviet rival, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).

'So far it looks great. Soulful.. Thank you MGM For this opportunity to entertain.' 

Stallone, who directed the original 1985 film, is working on a new edit himself. If he follows the model of directors' cuts of the past, there will likely be more screen time for Rocky.

What fans won't be seeing in the updated cut: Paulie's (Burt Young) robot butler named Sico. Some critics and fans over the years had deemed the robot as too gimmicky and campy.   

'The robot is going to the junkyard forever. No more robot,' he responded to one fan while adding to another, 'I don't like the robot anymore.'   

Fans and followers appeared to be split on whether Sico should be removed from the updated version.
