She overhauled her lifestyle after giving birth and dropped two stone with an intense exercise plan.

And Katie Waissel was keen to show off her incredible figure as she headed out in London on Thursday in skimpy workout gear. 

The former X Factor star, 34, looked sensational in a skimpy black sports bra and shorts that showed off her incredible abs and toned legs.  

Tanned and toned: Katie Waissel was keen to show off her incredible figure as she headed out in London on Thursday in skimpy workout gear

Katie - who shares two-year-old son Hudson with her ex, fitness trainer Andy Speer - was practising what she preaches after vowing to 'embrace' her skin. 

The songstress shared a snap with her Instagram followers baring her stomach captioned: 'E M B R A C E Y O U R I N N E R & O U T E R H E R O'.

She added: 'It breaks my heart that I often hear people say if they could change anything about themselves, it would be their postpartum tummy skin.   

'And what breaks my heart even more, is when telling me this, they immediately grab it, pull, yank, squeeze it, flick it, and misinterpret it as being "fat" rather than understanding what it is, why we have it and why I encourage you to embrace it.'

She continued: 'Our tummy skin so thankfully and generously gained elasticity to stretch, protecting our abdominal muscles and pretty much everything underneath, allowing room for our organs to shift to house our ever growing babies in the womb (how impressive is that!). 

'What you see here in this photo my friends is just skin. And to be quite frank, skin that I can honestly say I am beyond proud to bare because I am in still in awe of what my body did when growing my son. 

'During pregnancy, a hormone called Relaxin enables our body to quite literally shape shift. This is our first ever selfless act as a parent haha! The reason i post this is to invite you to change you mindset here.

Candid: The songstress shared a snap with her Instagram followers baring her stomach as she encouraged her followers to embrace the skin they have 

'Forget weight loss, or muscle and strength gain just for a second. Forget judgement, either from yourself or your fear of judgement from others. Take a deep breath, and reset your dialogue within yourself. 

'And instead of including an external dermal layer of skin with your health and fitness goals, instead I encourage you to be proud of the miracle in which your body went through. 

'I always talk about the negative connotations with the famously used postpartum saying ‘bounce back’, and strongly advise you to stay away from that mindset- as to me, there is no such thing as going backwards, and who would want to after achieving rockstar star status post delivery! 

'So instead I call it "The Restoration" — and with any restoration on a classic, it is imperative to keep and honor the history and character which is Y O U. Every day is a brand new opportunity to reset and restore— now go get ‘em!' 

Sweet: Katie is mother to son Hunter, two, and said she is 'beyond proud to bare because I am in still in awe of what my body did when growing my son'
