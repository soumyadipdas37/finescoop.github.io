While on their show a few weeks ago, Sia - whose real name is Sia Kate Isobelle Furler - mentioned she wanted to help the radio stars do good for the community.

'I like do-gooding. Maybe wanna do something together? Like, maybe I'll give you guys $100,000 that you can give out to people?' the 44-year-old suggested.

Fitzy and Wippa praised Sia's commitment to her generous comment as they labelled her humble, grounded and a star with a 'big heart'.

'The best thing about Sia is how humble she is and understands where she’s come from and how she’s never let her success get to her. Her feet are still so grounded and that’s what I love about her. I feel like she feels like she shouldn’t be in this position and other people should be in it,' Fitzy said.

Wippa agreed of the Chandelier hitmaker: 'Besides her music, we love her as well, she’s got such a big heart.'

'If there’s someone in your life, family member, friend where you just don’t have any more answers. We want to help these people out,' Fitzy said to listeners.

'That's the new high': The notoriously private star said that being 'newly rich' was 'really weird and fun' as she could help 'make a lot of people's dreams come true'

Speaking on The Kyle and Jackie O Show in May, the notoriously private star said that being 'newly rich' was 'really weird and fun' and had given her opportunities to help others.

'It means I can make a lot of people's dreams come true, which is the best feeling ever, especially now I don't drink or do drugs, so that's the new high,' she said.

The Adelaide-born singer is currently isolating with her family in Los Angeles, which consists of two adopted 19-year-old sons and two recently-born grandchildren.
