Sonny Jay has signed up for the 2021 series of Dancing On Ice, it has been claimed.

The radio presenter, 27, hosts Capital FM's breakfast show alongside Roman Kemp during the week but is now set to try his luck on skates, reports The Sun.

It comes after Myleene Klass, 42, was confirmed as being the competition's first celebrity contestant on Sunday. 

Up for the challenge? Sonny Jay has reportedly signed up for the 2021 series of Dancing On Ice

Sonny is a regular on the radio and often shares snaps with his co-hosts Roman, who appeared on I'm A Celebrity in 2019, and Sian Welby to Instagram.

Last month he announced his engagement to girlfriend of three years Lauren Faith after proposing on a romantic yacht ride in Mykonos. 

Revealing the news on Instagram, Sonny gushed he 'couldn’t be happier to spend the rest of his life' with her. 

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Sonny and Dancing On Ice for a comment.  

Confirmed: It comes after Myleene Klass, 42, became the first celebrity confirmed to appear on the series which is set to return to screens in 2021

Bring it on! The star said she was 'so excited' to get skating and couldn't wait to make her daughters proud in a gushing Instagram post 

On Sunday fellow radio presenter Myleene took to Instagram to share the exciting news that she was preparing to join Dancing On Ice in 2021. 

The mother-of-three said that she's 'up for the challenge' and wants to make her daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, 'proud'. 

She told her fans: 'Guess who won't be holding the coats at the side of the rink anymore! I am so, SO excited to be joining the cast of Dancing On Ice.

'My girls have always wanted me to do this but I've always been too scared someone will skate over my fingers!

Wedding bells: Sonny recently announced he was engaged to 'the most beautiful soul' Lauren Faith after proposing on a romantic yacht ride in Mykonos last month

'Anyway, I want to make them proud and show them I'm up for a challenge when completely out of my comfort zone but most of all, I want a bum like Jlo!'    

Myleene's exciting new challenge comes just one week after she revealed she had gotten engaged to the father of her one-year-old son Apollo, Simon Motson.  

The mother-of-three was astounded when her partner of five years popped the question with a nine-carat diamond ring on the fifth anniversary of their first date. 

Dancing On Ice will return to ITV in the new year and see twelve celebrities skate live with their professional partners each week.

The duos will try to impress both the panel and the viewers who will ultimately decide who is crowned the winner of the show.

Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby once again return to present the show and the expert panel of Torvill and Dean, John Barrowman and Ashley Banjo will all resume their roles as judges.

Other stars thought to be in the running for a spot in the popular competition include Jason Donovan and Denise Van Outen.

The former Neighbours heartthrob - who competed on Strictly in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the ITV show when it airs in January.

Happy news: Myleene's confirmation for the popular series comes just one week after she revealed she was engaged to her long-term beau Simon Motson

Overjoyed:  Myleene said she wanted to make her daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, who are fans of skating themselves, proud and 'show them I'm up for a challenge when completely out of my comfort zone' by competing on the show

A source told The Sun that Jason had lots of 'star power' but added that his dancing skills may not be as helpful as he thinks once on the ice.

Jason isn't the only West End star who has been linked to the rink, with Denise Van Outen said to have signed a deal worth around £40,000 to appear on the series. 

According to the Daily Star, Denise 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month. 

Line-up: It comes after former Coronation Street actress Faye Brookes was said to have also signed up for Dancing On Ice (pictured in 2019)

While other names rumoured to have signed up to the physically intense show include actor Rufus Hound, YouTube rapper Lady Leshurr and Coronation Street actress Faye Brookes.

Reality star Billie Faiers and footballer Wayne Bridge, who is married to former Dancing On Ice contestant and The Saturdays singer Frankie, have also been tipped for the upcoming series in recent weeks.

The most recent season of Dancing On Ice aired in January and was won by former EastEnders star Joe Swash.
