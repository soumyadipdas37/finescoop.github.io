An Australian mum has opted to use a $15 chic matte black bread bin from Kmart to store her nail polish supplies in.

Posting to Facebook, mum Leanne impressed thousands of people with her simple but stylish idea.

More than 1,200 people 'liked' the post, saying the idea would ensure no nail polish bottle is misplaced. 

Leanne's 11-year-old daughter helped line the nail polish bottles in rows in the top compartment, while the bottom drawer is used to store cotton buds, cotton pads and nail polish remover.

'Best idea I've ever seen, my daughter's going to love this,' one mum said.

'Great idea!! I should get this! I have a lot of nail polish and I'm never able to find the right box to store them!' Another said.

A third said: 'Oh this is a brilliant idea! This would work well for sewing supplies as well.' 

'I've been looking for this bin but I can never find it!' Another mum said. 

While the product is stylish, Kmart no longer sells the same item in store - though similar boxes are available for $10.

Other women have previously bought the bread box to store makeup products, makeup brushes, jewellery, bath bombs and hair ties.

While some have brought the box back into the kitchen and used it as a herb garden.

'The other one has bangles, jewellery and earrings. It's nice and neat and now I know where everything is,' she said.
