Studio 10 host Joe Hildebrand made the shock announcement he is resigning from the embattled morning show on Thursday. 

And the 44-year-old respected journalist looked somewhat glum when he was spotted for the first time since the shock decision. 

After what was surely a tough day at the office, Joe looked to be taking the career move in his stride as he returned home.

Joe looked stoic and stony-faced as he exited his car and walked towards his smiling wife Tara Ravens at their Sydney home. 

The former Channel Ten star held onto his phone tightly as he checked his text messages before making it to the gate. 

Tara greeted her husband with a warm smile as the pair chatted at the gate of their house, while Tara held their young baby.

The journalist's outfit choice appeared to reflect his sombre decision to leave Studio 10 after seven years on the show. 

He wore a black Guns and Roses crew neck t-shirt, along with black jeans, black sneakers and a brown belt.

He carried his belongings in a messenger bag he wore slung over his shoulder.

On Thursday, Joe broke down in tears live on air as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to leave the show. 

The presenter's position on the morning talk show had been up in the air ever since Channel 10 announced its latest round of redundancies last month.

Addressing the uncertainty surrounding his role, Joe explained that he 'wanted to rip the Band-Aid off and not make it harder than it has to be'.

Joe was joined by Kerri-Anne Kennerley, entertainment reporter Angela Bishop and host Sarah Harris as he announced his departure.

He began: 'I do have some news. I want to say it here first before you saw it or heard it anywhere else.  

'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.

'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role.'    

Speaking of his bosses' reaction when he told them he was leaving Studio 10, Joe said: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them!'

'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of,' he added.

'[I want to] give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around.'  

Sarah also broke down in tears, and was clearly touched by Joe's kind words.

Despite the setback, Joe reassured viewers that he was 'talking to other people about some exciting work opportunities' and wouldn't be out of work for long.
