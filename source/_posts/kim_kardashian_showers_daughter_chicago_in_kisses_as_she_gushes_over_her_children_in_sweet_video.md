Kim Kardashian recently announced the end of her family's long-running reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

But the SKIMS mogul is continuing to document her life, churning out content for her 189million Instagram followers.

She showered daughter Chicago in kisses Monday, as she took to her Instagram Story with a sweet video of herself gushing over her children at home in Calabasas.

The 39-year-old wrapped her arm around the toddler, two, who made silly faces, while eating a chocolate cupcake.

'You're such a cutie,' she told Chicago, as she kissed her on the cheek, asking: 'What are these faces you're making?'

She mimicked her baby girl's faces, puckering her lips and sticking out her tongue, asking: 'Is it good? So good?'

Kim squeezed Chicago with a big hug, giving her more kisses, as her son Psalm, one, could be heard crying in the background.

'Say "mommy,"' she told the baby, as he finally looked up at the camera, before giving him a smooch on the cheek.

Kim also shares daughter North, seven, with husband Kanye West, 43, whom she married in May of 2014 during a ceremony in Italy.

She's recently been supporting Kanye, following some concerns with his mental health, after he posted some more bizarre tweets.

A source told Us Weekly last week: 'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he is bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help.

'She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.'

The couple has reportedly been facing some marital issues after he launched a last-minute presidential campaign back in July, later sharing some very private details of their marriage at a campaign rally in Charleston, South Carolina.

Kim announced the end of KUWTK earlier this week, following 20 seasons and 13 years on E!, after she and sister Kylie Jenner, 23, reportedly wanted out, giving 'momager' Kris Jenner, 64, no choice but to cancel the show.       

A source told The Sun: 'The family have been locked in an ongoing debate over the future of the show for months now.

'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on. He's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

It came after sister Kourtney, 41, left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia.
