'On Thursday, Sept. 17, in an exclusive interview, Stassi Schroeder speaks for the first time after being let go from the hit Bravo series “Vanderpump Rules” – a result of her racially insensitive actions that resurfaced this past June,' read the press release.

'She will discuss how the incident and recently announced pregnancy have reshaped her perspective on work and life,' the release added.

It's possible that she could also discuss new projects she has in the works, since a report from August revealed she's in talks for a collaboration with Evolution Media.

Schroeder does still have six months left on her Bravo contract, which would prohibit her from joining another show until it expires.  

The blonde reality star also has offers to be an influencer for various online brands, according to the TMZ report.

Despite this report, no official collaboration between Schroeder and any online brand has been confirmed quite yet.

Schroeder was fired from Vanderpump Rules along with Kristen Doute, when it was revealed that they filed a false police report against former VR co-star Faith Stowers, the only Black woman to appear on the hit reality show.

Schroeder and Doute told police that Stowers fit the description of a Black woman who was robbing men in Los Angeles, and Schroeder and Doute even admitted to calling the cops on Stowers.

Schroeder had started working at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurants Sur and Blanca Villa in 2010, and she has been on Vanderpump Rules since it debuted in 2013.
