Married At First Sight's Jules Robinson is expecting her first child with husband Cameron Merchant any day now.  

And on Tuesday, the 36-year-old flaunted her growing bump on Instagram, as she undertook an unusual workout ahead of the bub's arrival. 

The soon-to-be mum explained that she was practicing her pelvic floor exercises to prevent bladder leakage. 

'No one wants to be restricted': On Tuesday, Jules Robinson (pictured) revealed she was practicing her pelvic floor exercises to prevent bladder leakage ahead of her baby's birth 

'The face of a woman thinking, 'Am I doing my pelvic floor exercises right?"' she captioned the image. 

'No one wants to be restricted in life by bladder leaks right?! You want to laugh as hard as possible, do the exercise you like and hey sneeze and not be scared!' 

Jules went on to share a series of instructions to her 332k followers on how to do the exercises correctly.
