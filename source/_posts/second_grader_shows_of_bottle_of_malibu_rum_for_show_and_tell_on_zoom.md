A second grader left her mother red-faced this week when she grabbed a bottle from her parents' liquor cabinet for show and tell. 

Meghan Maza Oeser from Mokena, Illinois, looked in on her daughter Penny while she attended the first day of class on Zoom on Monday and stopped in her tracks when she saw the little girl holding up a bottle of Malibu rum.

The assignment appears to have been to show the class 'something that smells good' — and Penny, understandably charmed by the liquor's coconut scent, held up a large bottle for her classmates.

She's not wrong! She was showing her class 'something that smells good' — a bottle of coconut-flavored Malibu rum

Meghan, a mother of six, snapped a picture of the funny moment and shared it on Facebook. 

'It’s moments like these that I wish I didn’t go all “b***s out” on having children,' Meghan wrote.

'Here’s Penny... Showing her class “something that smells good.”'

She added the hashtags #InJesusNameAmen, #BlessIt, #PleaseTakeThemBackNow, #HideYoWife, #HideYoKids, and #HideYoMalibu.

In the picture, an innocent-looking Penny seems oblivious that she's holding something only grown-ups should have, and is smiling at her classmates and teacher on the computer screen.

Relatable: The post has quickly gone viral, earning 91,000 likes in just three days — and lots of laughing emojis from commenters

Planning something? Meghan also showed her daughter in a more innocent, booze-free moment

Cutie: She also showed off some artwork during her class

Dressed in a hoodie and pink headphones, she's lifting the bottle up to her face, so there's no mistaking what it is for anyone at home.

The post has quickly gone viral, earning 91,000 likes in just three days — and lots of laughing emojis from commenters.

'And this is why you don’t leave random things around your house. Your kid will take it to school for show and tell,' wrote one with laughing emojis.

'Oh my god this made me literally LAUGH OUT LOUD!!! I almost spit out my mountain dew,' said another.

Several said they can see their own kids doing something similar, while one mom said her daughter once brought her box of White Claw for show and tell.

At the end of the first day of 'e-learning' at the start of the pandemic, Meghan took a shower and reached for her favorite Costco towel when she got out.

'You guys know what happens to a super huge a** heavy towel draped over the body of someone that could pretty much represent the Lollipop Guild?' she wrote on Facebook at the time. 'It slips.'

Meghan was still in her bedroom in her towel when one of her kids walked in, with her phone screen facing toward her mother. 

'[She] whispers... "How do I end this?"' wrote Meghan. 'How does she end WHAT, you ask? The MFing LIVE GOOGLE HANGOUT with her ENTIRE classroom!!!

'So there I am... heavy towel... that fell around my waist... with my 40-something year old [breasts] staring Mrs. Definitelygonnaneedsometherapyafterthis RIGHT in the face!!!' she wrote.

'My boobs. Were in. Her face. And since my brain, now misfiring in EVERY direction as to what in TactualF to do next, is completely cashed out from e-learning... I stand up...t o flip her phone to the ceiling... and casually then don my late 70’s Coronabush.'
