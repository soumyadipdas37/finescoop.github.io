With woolly jumper season fast approaching, it might be time to give your wardrobe a reshuffle. 

Amazon shoppers have discovered the perfect solution to limited wardrobe space - and it's bound to become a staple in your day-to-day life. 

Storing away your seasonal summer wardrobe, duvets and towels has never been easier thanks to the Lifewit Large Capacity Clothes Storage Bag. One fabric storage bag can hold up to 35 clothes so is a real storage hack when space is short. 

Even better, you can now snap up a pack of three for only £12.73 as it's now on sale.

Super spacious, the Lifewit Large Capacity Clothes Storage Bags can hold up to 35 items of clothes or one king size comforter 

The quilted fabric storage bags have a generous capacity of 90 liters, making it the perfect size for family's or those with one too many clothes.

Pop the fabric bag up and fill it up with unused seasonal clothes and comforters to maximise your wardrobe space. Incredibly useful and neat, they slip easily under beds. 

The storage bags have become such a hit they're currently the number one bestseller in 'Under-Bed Storage' on Amazon. 

With close to 3,000 ratings on Amazon and a near-perfect average score of 4.6 out of 5, the Lifewith Clothes Storage Bags are a hugely popular an practical choice.  

Shoppers have raved about the lightweight bags, commending them as 'such a useful item', 'surprisingly spacious' and 'lightweight but strong'.

While vacuum bags are an alternative option, they leave clothes wrinkled and it's incredibly difficult to see inside once you've put your clothes away. Plus they're not big enough to stow away comforters. With these storage bags they'll keep everything neat and tidy, protect against dust and thanks to the perspex front, you can see what's inside.  

'Brilliant storage bags, which have completely transformed my cupboards of bedding and towels. These storage bags are large, lightweight and strong. Material seemed thin at first glance but I am using them in an overhead cupboard and the handles and fabric seem to be holding up well.'

The Lifewit Comforter Storage Bag Set is suitable for storing clothes or comforters for changing seasons

'We purchased this for my daughter's surplus winter clothing' wrote another in their five-star review 'the bags are deep, good quality and good zips. I can see they are reusable over and over again. The transparent panel is useful and the bags keep good shape when filling with clothes. Would recommend. Good value for money.'

Another wrote: 'This bag just keeps on giving! So much space, I have stored at least 20 pairs of Jean's and there is still room for more bits! Sturdy thick zips feel robust and have held everything nicely. Thick handles either side and convenient little window at the front.' 

Shoppers have thought up of plenty of ways to make use of the Lifewit Large Capacity Clothing Bags filling them with seasonal clothes, bedding, towels, comforters and even accessories.

'These storage bags are fantastic. They are true to size and huge. Good quality and with the perspex front it is easy to see through. I've stored my handbags in 2 of them......yes I have a collection! I would highly recommend these bags especially for storing bedding as well.'
