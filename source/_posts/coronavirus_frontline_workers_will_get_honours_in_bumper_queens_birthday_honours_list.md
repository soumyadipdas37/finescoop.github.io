Hundreds of doctors, nurses and other heroes in the battle against coronavirus will be recognised in a ‘bumper’ honours list to be published next month.

People who have made outstanding contributions in the UK’s response to the virus will be rewarded in a special Queen’s Birthday Honours List on October 10.

Boris Johnson announced earlier this year that the Birthday Honours, normally released in June, would be put back to allow time to say thank you for the work of those on the frontline against the pandemic.

Downing Street said yesterday that following approval from the Queen, the Covid heroes would be honoured next month in a ‘bumper’ honours list which will also include recipients chosen before the pandemic for a ‘broad range’ of achievements.

As the list would be the first to include Covid-19 nominations during the ongoing pandemic, it will prioritise frontline and community heroes, No 10 said.

They added that these recipients – like centenarian Captain Sir Tom Moore who has already been knighted for his inspiring fundraising – would be ‘outstanding examples’ of contributions still being made right across the UK.

The Prime Minister said: ‘As we all redouble our efforts to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives this winter, I am pleased that we have an opportunity to recognise those who have given so much to this country already.

‘The coronavirus pandemic is the greatest health challenge in our lifetime.

‘We all have to play our part, but the dedication, courage and compassion seen from these recipients, be it responding on the frontline or out in their communities providing support to the most vulnerable, is an inspiration to us all.

‘We owe them a debt of gratitude and the 2020 Queen’s Birthday honours will be the first of many occasions where we can thank them as a nation.’

In The Mail on Sunday last week, former Conservative Party Deputy Chairman Lord Ashcroft suggested that NHS staff generally should be honoured with a ‘collective award’ of the George Cross for their Covid heroics, just as the island of Malta was durig the Second World War for resisting Nazi aggression.
