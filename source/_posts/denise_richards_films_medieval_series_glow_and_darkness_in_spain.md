Denise Richards had been filming the medieval drama series Glow And Darkness in Madrid, Spain when the coronavirus outbreak forced the production to be shut down in mid-March.  

Months later, the 49-year-old reality star returned to set with her Spanish producer and director Jose Luis Moreno and costars, including Natalie Radmall-Quirke and Victoria Summer. 

Before slipping into a costume for the period drama on Wednesday, she could be seen sporting a blue tank top with a lighting bolt and a relaxed pair of sweatpants.

The actress, who is a mom to two teenage daughters with ex-husband Charlie Sheen and a nine-year-old girl she adopted while single, rocked her signature messy bun. 

As she sat outside and engaged in a lively conversation, Richards elected not to wear a mask and could be seen embracing someone on set.  

The beauty appeared comfortable mingling without makeup, just two weeks after revealing to fans on Instagram she was flying to Siguenza.

'On my way to Spain. Back shooting #glowanddarkness started before we were all on lockdown,' the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star captioned a selfie wearing a face mask on an airplane. 

In the same post, she graciously thanked 'everyone that jumped through hoops' to get her back to Europe amid the ongoing pandemic. 

Since her initial post, she has been teasing a number of elaborate looks from the international series, which include her wearing medieval gowns and crowns.

In the behind-the-scenes selfie at the end of August, Richards smiled brightly in a pastel pink dress with a gold headpiece in her tightly curled hair.  

She appeared to be loving her looks with tiaras, as she posed for another picture in a silver and jeweled tiara the next week.

'Adjusting my crown for the last shot... before getting into my big dress that weighs more than heavy drapes at the fanciest hotel. can’t we have both?' she asked her 1.3 million Instagram followers.

This comes after Lisa Rinna angrily accused Richards of 'gaslighting' her castmates during The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season 10 reunion that aired Wednesday on Bravo.

During the first of three virtual reunion episodes, Lisa, 57, vented her fury at Denise for her repeated criticisms of the cast.

Above all, she couldn't let go of the fact that Denise had chastised them for discussing threesomes during a barbecue at her house, within earshot of her kids.

Lisa quickly reminded Denise that she'd shared plenty of her own dirty stories on camera.

'You bring up your husband's penis almost every show,' she yelled, referring to a remark the actress made about her husband Aaron Phypers, 47, at that same dinner.

'I think she was trying to make us as a group look bad,' Erika Girardi, 49, opined, recalling the proximity of the kids' table to the adults', where sex talk was sure to be had.

Lisa also mentioned a tale Denise told last season about the sexual encounters she and Aaron had enjoyed with certain masseurs.

'The whole world knows about Denise's husband going and getting a happy ending from like, a 100-year old woman,' Lisa shouted.

Erika recalled that Denise had taken her out to coffee to talk to her about the threesome conversation, and emphasized that she'd felt singled out by Denise's anger.

'I took it on the chin; I apologized sincerely,' Erika said. 'Then I find out you take it to Teddi [Mellencamp-Arroyave, 39] and Sutton [Stracke]. Motherf***er, I'm out. That's bulls***.'

Denise denied singling out Erika or complaining about her, which made Erika apoplectic.

'Denise, oh my God,' she blurted. 'Am I on another f***ing planet?'

'No, you're just being gaslit, Erika,' Lisa cracked.
