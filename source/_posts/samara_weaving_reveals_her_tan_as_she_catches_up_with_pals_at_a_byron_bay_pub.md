She shocked onlookers over the weekend when she stepped out of a Byron Bay spray tanning salon sporting a very bronzed hue.

But after washing off the product hours later, Samara Weaving achieved the desire results.

The 28-year-old actress showed off her tan as she caught up with friend at the famous Beach Hotel on Monday.

The blonde beauty, who is in town to film the series Nine Perfect Strangers, was simply glowing as she smiled and chatted away with her pals. 

Samara also flaunted her super slender figure in a pair of black leggings paired with a grey sweater. 

She carried the new coveted Louis Vuitton handbag, the $5650 LV Pont 9, revealing her claw-like acrylic nails which were painted in a light shade of grey.

Her performance as the bride fighting for her life in a deadly game of hide-and-seek had producers scrambling to cast her in Scream 5.

However, while speaking to Collider on Friday, Samara revealed the reason she had to turn down the exciting role.

'We talked about it a lot, but unfortunately, because of scheduling, I couldn't do it,' she said.
