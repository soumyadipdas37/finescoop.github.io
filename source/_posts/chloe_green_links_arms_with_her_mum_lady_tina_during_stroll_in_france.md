Her father's £100million superyacht the Lionheart was confined to a port in Monaco earlier this week after two of the crew tested positive for coronavirus.

Meanwhile Tina, 71, cut a casual figure in a bright pink gym top and tight black leggings.

Both women made sure to put safety first as they donned leopard print face masks for the low-key outing. 

The pair looked to be in a sombre mood as they browsed the shops and Chloe pushed a pram.

However her son Jayden Meeks-Green, who she welcomed with ex hot felon Jeremy Meeks in 2018 was nowhere to be seen.

Their outing comes after Sir Philip Green's £100 million superyacht was quarantined in Monaco earlier this week with Tina onboard. 

Two crewmen tested positive aboard the 300ft Lionheart and its yellow flag was flying in Port Hercules to signify the vessel bears the contagion.

Lady Tina told The Sun that she was on board the luxury boat, but did not reveal whether Sir Philip or Chloe were with her.

'After maintenance in Italy, the boat returned to Monaco. We were meant to go on a cruise with my family,' Lady Tina said.

'It was my responsibility to have the whole crew tested before leaving. We then discovered two cases - one asymptomatic and the other with a sore throat.

'The two have been confined to the cabin ever since. The rest and myself are on the boat. Everyone is well.'

Topshop boss Sir Philip – who furloughed 14,500 staff in April – was last spotted lounging on the yacht three weeks ago on the French Riviera.

The colossal boat, complete with helipad, pool, 15 crew cabins and room for 12 guests, is where the 68-year-old has conducted much of his business for the last two years.

When not at sea, Sir Philip lives at his £20million Roccabella penthouse in Monaco.
