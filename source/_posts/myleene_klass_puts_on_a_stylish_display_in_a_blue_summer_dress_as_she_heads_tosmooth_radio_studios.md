She always knows how to show off her sartorial prowess while out and about.

And Myleene Klass looked sensational in a summer look as she arrived at the Global Radio studios ahead of her Smooth Radio show in London on Monday.

The former Hear'Say singer, 42, put on a stylish display in a navy blue wrap-front dress that was adorned with orange flowers.

Wow! Myleene Klass put on a stylish display in a plunging blue floral summer dress and knee-high boots as she headed to Smooth Radio studios in London on Monday

Myleene colour-coordinated her ensemble by stepping out in a pair of beige knee-high boots that perfectly complemented her summer dress.

Her ensemble had a plunging neckline to show off a glimpse of her cleavage and she accessorised with an array of pendant necklaces. 

The TV personality wore her brunette locks in a sleek, straight style and used a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

Finishing off the look, Myleene wore a chic brown fedora hat and she shielded her eyes with a pair of large shades.

Attention to detail: Her ensemble had a plunging neckline to show off a glimpse of her cleavage and she accessorised with an array of pendant necklaces

Her appearance came after her recent social media run-in with a troll who claimed her boyfriend Simon will cheat on her. 

The broadcaster recently posted a gallery of sweet images with the PR executive beau, 45, to celebrate five years since they had met.

However a troll wrote underneath: 'Not long before this one cheats on you. Dear oh dear, heading for the lawyers are we?'  

In a pointed response, she fired back: 'He wishes! Cheating exes usually get a house, a car and a fat pay-off, in what appeared to be a dig at her ex-husband Graham Quinn, who left her on her 34th birthday in 2012. 

The heartbreaking incident came just six months after the couple's wedding, but they had been together for 11 years at the time, after meeting when Graham became the bodyguard for Myleene's pop group Hear'Say in 2001. 

The former couple are parents to two daughters, Ava, 13, and Hero, nine and Myleene was devastated to learn that he had secretly bought a bachelor pad for himself – meaning that he must have been planning his departure for some time. 

The TV star was said to be blindsided by the split after supporting Graham, but it was never publicly confirmed if he cheated. 

Myleene is now in a happy relationship with PR exec Simon who she began dating in 2015 after being introduced by two mutual friends. They welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.
