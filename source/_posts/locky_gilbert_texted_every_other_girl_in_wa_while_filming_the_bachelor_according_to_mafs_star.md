Their unlikely friendship was revealed back in June.

And on Tuesday, Married At First Sight star Aleks Markovic left her Reality Roundup co-hosts shocked with her claims about what Locky Gilbert got up to during his break from filming The Bachelor. 

'I can tell you now that Locky wasn't just texting The Bachelor Girls. It was them and every other girl in WA,' she said. 

Hello! On Tuesday, Married At First Sight star Aleks Markovic (pictured) said Locky Gilbert was texting 'every other girl in WA' while filming The Bachelor in lockdown 

When asked by host Filip Odžak if Bella Varelis' recent behaviour on the Channel 10 dating show is her own undoing she replied: 'I can't comment much on this because, I was with Locky [during the COVID break].'

The 27-year-old continued: 'I think those three girls need to have each other's backs, because at the end of the day they've only got each other at the end.'

Aleks then explained that fans should be reminded that the reality show was filmed months ago, and Locky and the girls could have potentially parted ways.

When asked by host Filip if Bella Varelis' recent behaviour on the Channel 10 dating show is her own undoing she replied: 'I can't comment much on this because, I was with Locky [during the COVID break].'

Back in March, wild rumours surfaced about what happened behind the scenes after on-site production of The Bachelor was suspended in Sydney to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

According to Woman's Day, Locky resumed his usual social life when he returned to Perth - and one night out in April apparently left some of the contestants unhappy.

After being spotted together on social media, Aleks addressed the rumours about her and Locky on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on April 30.  

Response: After being spotted together on social media, Aleks told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on April 30 that Locky was a 'beautiful person', but clarified they were just friends 

Aleks said that Locky was a 'beautiful person', but clarified they were just friends.

The Sydney-based real estate agent said she'd only met Locky the weekend prior when they were both visiting a mutual friend's house.

'I didn't even really know who he was,' she said of Locky. 'When he walked in the door, my friend was like, "He's The Bachelor!"'

'He's a lovely boy but for me, I think he's definitely got his eye on someone on The Bachelor,' she added.

Displeased: The contestants, who were all self-isolating in their own homes, were apparently not happy when they found out Locky was spending time with Aleks (pictured)
