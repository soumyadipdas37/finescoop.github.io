Tamara Jane Drake (pictured) was at the Empire Hotel, in Queenstown, on Tasmania's west coast, on October 8, 2019, when she heard a visitor making fun of the town while on the phone

A mother-of-three who punched a woman in the face 15 times for making fun of her home town has had her prison sentence suspended.

Tamara Jane Drake was at the Empire Hotel, in Queenstown, on Tasmania's west coast, on October 8 last year when she heard a visitor making fun of the town while on the phone. 

The 34-year-old approached the visitor and the pair had a conversation before the mother pushed her off of her chair, The Burnie News reported.  

Drake beat the other woman in the face - delivering 15 blows - and broke her nose, the Supreme Court in Burnie heard.

Other pub-goers had to restrain Drake. 

The victim's eye was cut and she needed facial reconstruction surgery. 

Justice Robert Pearce said the attack was alcohol-fuelled.

He said Drake had not expressed remorse for her cruel actions - which she tried to claim were in self-defence.

Justice Pearce said even though Drake pleaded guilty, she doesn't appear to understand the seriousness of her actions. 

The victim has no memory of the assault - and feels the impact of the attack every day. 

'She was embarrassed of her appearance and was off work for three months,' Justice Pearce said.

'She has some residual facial scarring and changed facial appearance and has trouble sleeping.'

Drake was sentenced to seven months in prison, but that has been suspended on the condition she does not commit any other offences.

The sentence was suspended for two years as she is the sole carer of her children, who are all under 12. 

She will also be on probation for 18 months.
