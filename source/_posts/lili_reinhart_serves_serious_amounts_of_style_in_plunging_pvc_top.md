Finding herself: Reinhart revealed she had been doing a lot of healing during the pandemic 

Following a 'chaotic' few years, Lili has been using her newfound free time to work on herself.

'I've talked to my therapist weekly and read self-help books... spent time with people who love, appreciate and validate my emotions. It's also been nice to rest and let my body recoup after a gruelling working schedule,' she said.

While Lili admitted to struggling to 'stay sane' during lockdown, she is still appreciative of all that it has allowed her to do.

'It's been hard to stay sane during this time. I've gone through many, many emotions throughout this pandemic. But overall I've grown a lot, actually, and am very grateful to have had this time to myself. The last few years of my life have been chaotic. And so to have had a few months to process my radically changing world and emotions has been vital to my mental sanity.'

'I am always prepared to fight for the rights of other human beings': During this time in lockdown, Lili has fought for causes important to her while embracing her true self

During this time in lockdown, Lili has fought for causes important to her while embracing her true self.

In June, the actress came out as bisexual in an Instagram post showing her support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

For Lili, coming out as bisexual was more about showing her support with the LGBTQ+ community.

Mountain girl: Reinhart flashed some leg as she soaked up the sunshine 

'The LGBTQ+ community always needs public support, and since I'm part of that community, I thought it might be time to come out as bisexual. It was sort of a nonchalant decision and I didn't expect the response that I got, but it was a good response.'

Lili has also protested racial inequality after the death of George Floyd sparked the recent national reckoning.

'I am always prepared to fight for the rights of other human beings. Black Lives Matter has been a strong movement, especially in the U.S., these last few months and I have been trying to contribute to that movement in a positive way,' she said.

This notion has also factored into her acting career, with the actress choosing to work on films that support inclusivity.

'It's also important for me to make sure the films that I produce and work on in the future are racially-diverse and don't include stereotypes that are harmful and add to a racist culture that already exists in film.'
