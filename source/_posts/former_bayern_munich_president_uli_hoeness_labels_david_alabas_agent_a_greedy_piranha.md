Former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has blasted the agent of David Alaba for the lack of agreement over a new contract, labelling him a 'greedy piranha'.

The 28-year-old's contract at the Allianz Arena expires next summer, and talks over a new deal for the versatile star have reportedly broken down at various stages.

But Hoeness is pinning the whole ordeal solely on his representative, Pini Zahavi, who has been involved in controversial deals for Ashley Cole and Rio Ferdinand in their moves to Chelsea and Manchester United respectively.

'He has a greedy piranha for an agent,' the former president told German outlet Sport 1.

'He lets himself be influenced by him very much. This is really all about the money. He is already at the best club in the world. 

'Where else would he go? We had a coffee several times over the past weeks, but because of Zahavi there has not been a result yet.'

 Manchester City, PSG, Barcelona and Real Madrid have all been linked with a move for Alaba during the ongoing negotiations.

Alaba has made 386 appearances for Bayern since making his debut in 2010 after joining the club's academy two years beforehand. 

The Austria international - who last season won his second treble with the German side - also stands just one short of a milestone 250th game in the Bundesliga. 

Bayern Munich open the defence of their title with a home encounter against Schalke on September 18, which is the first Bundesliga match of the 2020-21 campaign.

Six days later, they face Europa League winners Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup, which is to be held at the Puskas Arena in Budapest.
