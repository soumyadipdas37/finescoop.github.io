The former partner of a notorious bikie says he's owed an apology after Queensland authorities said he boarded a plane with coronavirus - and then retracted it.  

A health alert from the state on Tuesday claimed 48-year-old Shane Bowden was not contagious with COVID-19 when he flew from Melbourne to Brisbane the day before.  

But Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk repeated claims the former Finks bikie was infected on the flight at a media conference on Wednesday.   

Trudi McPhee, who has a teenage son with Bowden, told the Courier Mail her former partner was given 'the all-clear' by officials and would not have put the public in danger.

Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, repeated claims the former Finks bikie was infected on the flight at a media conference on Wednesday

Trudi McPhee, who has a teenage son with Bowden (pictured), said he was given 'the all-clear' by officials and would not have put the public in danger 

'They said he had COVID and they need to apologise to him but I don't think they have the balls to apologise to him, quite frankly,' said Ms McPhee.

The Premier doubled down on her point of view saying it was her 'understanding' that Bowden was positive when he arrived in the state.  

She then admitted she would need to check the details with Health Minister Steven Miles.

The confusion started when Qld Health issued a release on Tuesday stating a public health alert was not issued for the flight he was on. 

'New advice provided to Queensland Health is that he was not infectious while on the flight,' it stated.  

The convicted criminal was released from a five-year prison stint in Victoria two months ago, and within 15 days was the victim of a drive-by shooting.

The former bikie was in Royal Melbourne Hospital recovering from a gunshot to his leg when he was first diagnosed with COVID-19, and was still being treated for the virus 72 hours before he boarded the flight. 

Qld authorities are also investigating him for lying on his border declaration pass and are trying to determine if he committed an offence.

Ms McPhee previously told the Herald Sun the former bikie was desperate to leave Melbourne and was concerned he was being 'watched' while in hospital receiving treatment for COVID-19. 

'He is a pretty wild man, he was already wanted by Queensland police he had told me,' Ms McPhee said.

'He didn't want to be in Victoria anymore.'

 She thinks Bowden 'needs help' after he became consumed with the theory that people were watching him while he was recovering in hospital. 

'He checked out of hospital because he was very scared, he was worried people were watching him all the time... He is obviously not thinking properly,' she said. 

Ms McPhee said he made it clear to her that he wanted to head to the Gold Coast, but she had no clue how quickly he would leave.    

Bowden is also being investigated for lying on his Qld border declaration form. Pictured: Motorists are stopped at a checkpoint at Coolangatta on the Queensland- New South Wales border in August

Bowden spent seven years in prison for the shooting of another Melbourne bikie in 2006, and was said to be part of the Fink's 'Terror Team'.

He temporarily joined the Mongols but was recently booted from the club, Ms McPhee revealed.

'He lived for the Mongols, whatever happened, why he got kicked out — it is not my business. But, when things like this keep happening it is my opinion it is time to hang up your boots and find something else to do,' she said.

When he was released from jail in June, Bowden was 'happy' to be free and vowed to stay on the right side of the law, she added.

The 48-year-old made a glitzy exit from jail - picked up in a limousine.

He was met by an entourage of fellow gang members on motorbikes, who travelled an hour and a half from Melbourne to meet Bowden, the Herald Sun reported.  

He wrote in a social media post after his release and the subsequent shooting that he was excited to go back to Queensland. 

'Can't [wait] to get back there as [soon] as I can get back X the border,' he wrote, according to the Courier Mail.

The alleged breach comes as Queensland confirmed two new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday, out of 18,151 tests.  

Victoria recorded 90 new coronavirus cases during the same period - and a further six deaths.  

The state's parliament also voted to extend the government's emergency powers by another six-months. 

The new fatalities include five males in their 80s and one male in their 90s, all linked to aged-care outbreaks.

The figures bring Victoria's coronavirus death toll to 576.
