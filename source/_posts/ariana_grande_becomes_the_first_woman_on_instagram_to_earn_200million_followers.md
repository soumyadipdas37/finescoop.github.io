Ariana Grande earned another notch on her pop star belt by becoming the first woman on Instagram to garner 200million followers.

Upon learning the news of Ariana's achievement, Lady Gaga, who featured Grande on her hit track Rain On Me, took to Instagram to publicly congratulate her.

'[Congratulations] to my friend @arianagrande for 200 million followers! You're a queen! Wear that crown!' captioned Gaga on a mermaid inspired self-portrait shared with her 43.4million followers.

The very first person to reach the platform's 200million follower milestone was world renown professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in January of this year.

Since breaking the record, the 35-year-old Portugal national team captain had added over 37million to his follower count. He now sits at over 237million.

On Sunday night, Ariana and Gaga wowed their united fanbases, while performing their hit Rain On Me at Sunday's virtual MTV Video Music Awards ceremony.

And the Dangerous Woman singer took to Instagram after the show to pen a touching tribute to the Born This Way singer, 34, and to share behind-the-scenes snapshots of their performance.  

'thank u so much for having me @ladygaga i love u with all my heart always,' began the singer in her post's caption.
