A mum-of-four who has revealed her secrets to developing a portfolio of 20 properties by 37 - as well as sharing her top real estate tips.

The director of the property investment service Reventon, Billie Christofi from Melbourne, said she started saving and investing when she was just 16 and has always had a love of looking after her finances, which has paid dividends.

'Throughout my childhood, I was always encouraged to save any money I got for Christmas and my birthdays and put it into shares,' Billie told FEMAIL.

'I started my investment journey at the age of 16 when I took my money out of shares and put it into a commercial property to syndicate.'

Billie now has an array of 20 different properties (one of her properties pictured), and she said she bought her first home when she was just 22

By the time she turned 22, Billie said her initial deposit had tripled in value, and she had enough cash - along with her savings from part-time work and the first homeowners' grant - to buy her own home.  

'It was a big moment, and one I'd worked towards for a long time,' Billie recalled.

But this was by no means the end for the property mogul, who sold the house 18 months later with a cool increase in value of $150,000.

'I used this capital to then buy two properties and kept compounding after that using the growth of my investments to leverage and buy more properties,' Billie said.

Today, Billie has four homes in her personal name, as well as 16 in a trust with her husband.

She is currently looking to buy a 21st property through her superannuation.

When it comes to what you can do to get started on the property ladder, Billie (pictured) said it's all about being clever and picking the 'right property for your needs'

* Pick the right property for your needs. You want to target growth, but you need to see whether you can afford to have an aggressive purchasing strategy or something more neutrally-geared.

* Look at your cash flow regularly.

* Be disciplined and become a conscious spender and saver. Wait 24 hours before buying any 'want items'.

* Set up a Budget Table and consult it regularly so you can see where your finances are going. Highlight any areas where you can cut back.

* Assess your finances and interest rates regularly and see if there are better products available to consolidate your debts and save you money.

When it comes to what you can do to get started on the property ladder, Billie said it's all about being clever and picking the 'right property for your needs'.

'Initially, you have to target growth, so you gain equity and can further invest,' she said.

'The first thing you need to do is look at your cashflow and savings and see what fits into your portfolio best. 

'Are you cashflow poor and need something more neutrally-geared or do you have disposable income and can therefore be a bit more aggressive with your purchasing strategy?'

Billie said it pays to take risks if you can afford them, but only if you know you're not going to end up with debt.

The 37-year-old's second tip is discipline and converting yourself into a conscious saver and spender.

'It's so easy for spending to get out of hand. I advise people to sit down and tabulate their finances the old-fashioned way with a Budget Table and dissect where their finances are going,' Billie said.

Once you've done this, highlight areas where you can cut down and be more mindful.

Finally, she said you should always wait 24 hours before making a purchase decision on anything that is a 'want item'.

'The impulse tends to wear off if you give it some time,' she said.

While women often leave the bulk of the financial decisions to men, Billie (pictured) said it's absolutely vital that you educate yourself and 'take charge' of your own money

While women often leave the bulk of the financial decisions to men, Billie said it's absolutely vital that you educate yourself and 'take charge' of your own money.

'Play an active role in understanding money and getting the support you need to make sound investment decisions,' she said. 

'You should learn to do your own research and understand what is right for you and your affordability.'

If you don't understand what you're doing, Billie recommends getting a team of advisors around you, such as an expert from Reventon.

'We have helped over 3,000 clients gain financial progression,' she said.

'We are a holistic company that have all the financial services clients require to build their wealth.'
