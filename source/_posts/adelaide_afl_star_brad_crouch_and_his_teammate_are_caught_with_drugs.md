Two Adelaide Crows players have allegedly been caught with illicit drugs days after the team's horror season mercifully ended.

Star midfielder Brad Crouch and his teammate forward Tyson Stengle were stopped by police in the Adelaide CBD early on Monday morning.

They avoided any criminal charges but will likely face sanctions from the football club, the AFL or both.

Stengle, 21, was already in hot water after allegedly being caught drink driving at 0.125 blood alcohol level in April.  

Adelaide football manager Adam Kelly said the pair would be 'counselled' and given appropriate support'.

'First and foremost the alleged conduct is serious and we will continue to ask questions and make sure we have all of the facts before settling on a definitive position going forward,' he said.

'The club will also liaise closely with the AFL and AFL Players' Association during this process including working through any consequences under the AFL's illicit drug policy.

'What is absolutely clear is that all players across the league are well educated about drug use and relevant policies.

'As an organisation we take a very strong stance against any behaviour of this kind.

'The wellbeing of Brad and Tyson is also paramount and we will make sure they receive appropriate support.'
