Queen Letizia of Spain stole the show with a hot pink number as she joined her husband Felipe VI in Zaragoza today. 

The Spanish royal, 48, recycled a dress from the Michael Kors Collection to mark the 125th anniversary of local paper El Heraldo de Aragon (Aragon Herald) this afternoon at the newspaper's headquarters. 

Felipe VI, 52, praised the newspaper's 'integrity' and 'dedication to inform' as he and his wife received the Extraordinary Heraldo 125th Anniversary Award to mark the event, the newspaper reported.

The ceremony took place at noon rather than in the evening to best respect the sanitary measures put in place to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus.   

Queen Letizia of Spain stole the show with a hot pink number as she joined her husband Felipe VI in Zaragoza today. The Spanish royal, 48, recycled a dress from the Michael Kors Collection to mark the 125th anniversary of local paper El Heraldo de Aragon (Aragon Herald) this afternoon at the newspaper's headquarters

Looking in her element surrounded by journalists, Letizia, who used to be a reporter and newsreader, went for a co-ordinated look, matching her accessories to the dashing pink dress, which she first wore in July 2019.

The crepe number was adorned with silver details, which Letizia expertly matched to a belt that accentuated her petite figure. 

She wore little jewellery, apart from a favourite ring and a pair of silver hoop earrings, which matched her belt. 

She kept things simple by matching her clutch bag and velvet stilettos to the colour of her dress.

The couple looked in great spirit, with Felipe VI looking dapper in a blue suit and Letizia sporting pink from head to toe

She first made a splash in the number during audiences at Zarzuela Palace last year.

Letizia kept her smooth locks loose in a bouncy blow-dry and sported a dash of mascara and eye-shadow to compliment her natural glow. 

Felipe VI looked dapper in a navy suit and a white crisp shirt. His burgundy tie was reminiscent of his wife's outfit. 

The couple looked relaxed and it good spirits as they arrived at the reception, which honoured the five generations of journalists that have worked for the Heraldo throughout the years.  

Fernando de Yarza, the owner of the newspaper, handed the award, which marked the Heraldo's milestone anniversary,  to the royal couple.

Felipe VI particularly praised the dedication to information and the integrity of the reporters employed by the publication, which published its first edition in 1895. 

 '125 years ago the first Heraldo de Aragon took to the streets, and the fact that we are here is the result of the vocation of five generations,' he said. 

'The Heraldo is a clear voice in defense of freedom and committed to citizens,' he added.   

Both royals wore face coverings in accordance with sanitary guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus 

'We receive the award with enormous gratitude,' Felipe went on. 

Before she married into the Spanish royal family, Letizia herself was a successful broadcast journalist. 

She worked for a variety of news outlets, which included Bloomberg, CNN and ABC.  

The start of the school term has been busy for the couple after a challenging summer which saw runaway former King Juan Carlos sending shockwaves around the country in August by announcing he was leaving his homeland.

 Letizia and Felipe VI's two daughters, Infanta Leonor, 14 and Infanta Sofia, 13, are both self-isolating at home after one of Leonor's classmates tested positive to the coronavirus two days after she returned to school. 

Letizia's dark lock bounced on her shoulders in an impeccable blow-dry as the couple walked to the reception
