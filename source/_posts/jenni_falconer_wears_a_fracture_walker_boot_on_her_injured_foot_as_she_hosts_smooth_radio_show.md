The sleeveless number allowed the presenter to show off her tanned and toned frame, while she added a trendy touch with a single white skater shoe.

With her golden locks styled in a chin-length bob, the star opted to keep her makeup minimal and light, allowing her to let her natural beauty shine through.

Accessorising with a delicate platinum necklace, Jenni toted a large red leather handbag as she prepared to settle in for a morning of work.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Jenni Falconer for comment. 

Away from radio it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.

The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.

Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers.

She said of the new role: 'Start 2 Run is perfect for complete beginners and people who have started running during lockdown and hit the 5K distance.

'Running has become a lifeline for so many of us – as our daily exercise and a way of getting some fresh air.

'For many people, building up to a 5K or just beginning to jog short distances has shown the joy of running and this app is the perfect coaching tool to keep you going.'

The presenter is no stranger to keeping active and often shares images and videos of herself working out and staying fit on social media.
