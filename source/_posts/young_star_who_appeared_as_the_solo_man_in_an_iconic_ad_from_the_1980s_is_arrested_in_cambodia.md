Coutelas and his female friend, Tok Chany, 35, were detained for questioning, but it's not known if they have been charged. 

Deputy Chief of the Phnom Penh Municipal Anti-Drug Department Lieutenant Colonel Keo Sothearith said the packages weighed a total of 20kg.

'According to the police investigation, the drugs are suspected to have been brought across the Cambodian-Laos border to the capital,' Lt Col Sothearith, told Khmer Times.

'After transportation, someone attempted to conceal the drugs, hiding them in a garbage pile where they were unlikely to be found.'

The former actor has a history of arrests for drug use across South East Asia.

Coutelas was arrested in 2017 in the Cambodian resort of Sihanoukville for using and selling ice. 

He served time behind bars for unlawful transporting or trafficking of narcotics.

In Phuket, Thailand in 2014, Coutelas was sentenced to two years behind bars for  possession of crystal methamphetamine, possession of an illegal hand gun and ammunition. 

In 2015, he was released early on parole, then deported.

Coutelas' fall from grace comes after a successful career in osteopathy in Australia.

He moved to Cambodia in 2016 and set up a practice called Back Pain Solutions in Sihanoukville.
