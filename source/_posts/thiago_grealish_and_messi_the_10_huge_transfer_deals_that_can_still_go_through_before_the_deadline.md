With the summer transfer window running until October 5, clubs still have plenty of time to get their big-money deals over the line. 

Lionel Messi playing in the Premier League is a mouth-watering prospect and he's edging ever closer to Manchester City but the rest of the Premier League big guns could also be in for a busy few weeks.

Chelsea have been on a huge spree already and hope to add Kai Havertz  while Jack Grealish and Thiago Alcantara look likely to be pulling on new shirts next season.  

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at some of the biggest transfers that could still be done before the window slams shut.

Where he could go: Liverpool, Arsenal 

The Champions League final may have been the midfielder's last performance for Bayern Munich with the German side openly admitting he is ready for a new club.

 Jurgen Klopp is a big fan of the 29-year-old and Liverpool have been repeatedly linked with a move. However, Arsenal, ever improving under Mikel Arteta and victors over the Reds in the Community Shield, are also thought to be interested in the Spain international.

Bayern are holding out for a fee of £23million which both Premier League clubs are reluctant to pay on top of high wages. With one year left on his contract, the Bundesliga side may have to lower their asking price or risk losing him for nothing.

Where he could go: Manchester United 

Bournemouth have already sold Nathan Ake following their relegation to the Championship and Brooks looks set to be heading in the same direction. 

But while Ake joined Manchester City, Brooks could sign for rivals United with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer weighing up a £40million move for the Welshman. 

The Red Devils have been frustrated in their attempts to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund and are considering alternative options. The Cherries will not prevent any of their stars from securing moves away with manager Jason Tindall admitting every player has a price.

Grealish has repeatedly proved his loyalty to boyhood club Aston Villa and the midfielder led them to Premier League survival almost on his own last season.

But the 24-year-old is wanted by Solskjaer with the United boss desperate to add to his squad in order to mount a title challenge next season.

Villa value their captain at £70m but United have discussed the possibility of Sergio Romero moving to the Midlands club as part of a deal, which would bring down the price for Grealish.

Where he could go: Chelsea

Chelsea look set to finally secure the signing of £90m Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen.

Frankl Lampard has been pursuing the attacking midfielder for some time and the move is on the brink of completion after Bild reported he missed Bayer Leverkusen's performance tests over the weekend.  

Havertz, who scored 18 goals in all competitions last season, will follow his Germany team-mate Timo Werner who joined the Blues from RB Leipzig in a £53m deal in June.

Where he could go: Manchester City 

The Napoli defender has interested several Premier League clubs but the Italian's high asking price is proving to be a stumbling block. 

Pep Guardiola's side have been strongly linked with a move for the centre-back and the club reportedly had a £58m bid rejected earlier this summer.

City struggled with injuries to their defenders last season and Koulibaly would offer valuable experience. The 29-year-old has made nearly 200 appearances in Serie A and helped Napoli beat Juventus to win the Coppa Italia in June.

Where he could go: Manchester City, PSG, Inter Milan , Juventus

This is the story that shocked the football world when it broke early last week with Messi telling the only club he's ever played for that their relationship is over.

The bombhell was dropped on the back of an 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich and a trophyless season for Barca but walking away is not going to be easy.

The player thinks he should be allowed to leave for nothing but La Liga say he can't - and his release clause stands at £630m.

Man City and Pep Guardiola are very much the frontrunners for his signature after he didn't show for Barca's Covid-19 testing ahead of training but Inter Milan have been linked with the six-time Ballon d'Or winner and former director Massimiliano Mirabelli said Messi is more than just a dream sining for the Italians. 

Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus have also been linked.

Where he could go: Liverpool, Manchester City, Barcelona

A breakthrough Premier League campaign has seen Adama Traore linked with a big-money move away from Molineux - and Wolves are thought to be willing to listen to high offers.

The lightning quick winger is rated at £70m and earned praise from Liverpool and City bosses Klopp and Guardiola last season, with both clubs said to be interested in making a move.

Traore has claimed Guardiola tried to sign him when he was at Bayern Munich but has also publicly discussed the prospect of returning to Barcelona, after leaving in 2015.

Where he could go: Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund, PSG, Monaco 

Zaha made no secret of his desire to seal a move away from Selhurst Park last summer but a transfer to Arsenal and Everton failed materialise due to Crystal Palace's £80m asking price.

The winger still wants to leave and the Eagles are thought to be willing to accept offers of around £30m.

PSG, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco are all thought to be interested as well his former club United, who sold him to Palace for £6m in 2015. The Red Devils are believed to be due 25 per cent of any sale, meaning they could land the winger for as little as £22.5m.
