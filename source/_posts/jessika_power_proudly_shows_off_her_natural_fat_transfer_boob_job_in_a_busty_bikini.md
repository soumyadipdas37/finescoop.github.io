Jessika Power has been open about undergoing a $16,000 autologous fat graft to achieve her enviable cleavage. 

And on Friday, the former Married At First Sight star opened up about the procedure while showing off the stunning results in a series of Instagram videos.

Posing in a skimpy pink bikini, the 29-year-old boasted: 'As you guys can probably tell, I'm quite happy with my fat transfer!'

She then posted multiple videos of herself sunbathing in the skimpy bikini and seductively exiting a pool.

Jessika also opened up about her surgery last month in a Q&A with fans on Instagram.

The former reality star praised the procedure and called her Double Bay-based surgeon, Dr Anoop Rastogi, 'amazing'. 

Posing in a skimpy pink bikini, the 29-year-old boasted: 'As you guys can probably tell, I'm quite happy with my fat transfer!'

She explained to fans that the enhancement surgery achieved 'natural' looking breasts, taking her from a small C cup to a large D cup. 

'This isn't an implant, these aren't silicone, this is all of my breast,' she said.

'It's just the extra bit of fat I have on the side of my thighs that I wasn't happy with, injected into my boobs,' she added.

Careful! In one clip, the blonde beauty almost suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she bounced around in the bikini 

The blonde bombshell revealed that she spent two weeks in bed recovering and had no complications, but noted that different people will have different recovery times.

Jessika said: 'I would suggest this to anyone, I would suggest it over implants any day.'

She also revealed that she would only consider getting implants after having children.

Jessika's fat transfer 'boob job' isn't the only cosmetic procedure she's undergone.

She told New Idea last year that she's had over $50,000 worth of surgery since appearing on Married At First Sight in 2019.

In addition to the $16,000 fat transfer and breast augmentation, she has also had cheek and lip fillers and veneers.

'Throughout the show I was criticised for my fake lips and my fake this or that, so the last thing I needed to do was go and get fake boobs,' she said, explaining her decision to have a fat transfer instead of traditional silicone implants.
