Ursula von der Leyen today announced the European Union is launching legal action against the UK over Boris Johnson's plans to tear up parts of the Brexit divorce deal. 

Brussels had given Downing Street until the end of Septembet to scrap the Prime Minister's controversial proposals. 

But the UK Government refused to budge and Ms von der Leyen said this morning that as a result the bloc has now started legal proceedings. 

It has sent a 'letter of formal notice' to Number 10 which is the first step in the so-called 'infringement procedure'.

Speaking in Brussels she said: 'This draft bill is by its very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith laid down in the Withdrawal Agreement. 

'More over if adopted as is it will be in full contradiction to the protocol of Ireland/Northern Ireland. 

'The deadline lapsed yesterday. The problematic provisions have not been removed. 

'Therefore this morning the Commission has decided to send the letter of formal notice to the UK Government. 

'This is the first step in an infringement procedure. The letter invites the UK Government to send its observations within a month and besides this the Commission will continue to work hard towards a full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. We stand by our commitments.'
