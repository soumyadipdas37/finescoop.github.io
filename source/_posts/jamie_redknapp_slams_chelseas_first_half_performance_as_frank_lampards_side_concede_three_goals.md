Jamie Redknapp has slammed Chelsea after their abysmal first half performance against West Brom as Frank Lampard's side conceded three goals to the Premier League newcomers.

It was a nightmare opening 45 minutes from the Blues as the Baggies punished defensive errors from Marcos Alonso and new boy Thiago Silva, and poor defending of set pieces, to take an astonishing lead. 

Expectations are high at Stamford Bridge this season following a big summer in the transfer market, with the likes of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Ben Chilwell brought in for big money.

Frank Lampard's side went into the break three goals down to the Premier League newcomers

And Redknapp has hit out at the very poor first half display, labelling the big spenders 'sloppy' and 'lethargic' in a savage critique.   

'They've been so sloppy, so lethargic,' the Sky Sports pundit said. 'They've given the ball away time after time. They have been so lethargic in there. 

'Kante, Kovacic, they have been so bad in there in terms of how loose they have been on the ball. How loose they've been on the second ball. West Brom have been excellent but Chelsea have given them so much hope.

'The third goal just shows you how West Brom have been so switched on and Chelsea haven't.'

Chelsea are attempting to force a fightback in the second half, with strikes from Mason Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi offering Lampard's side hope of picking up a result in the Black Country.

Last weekend, the west London club were defeated by Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, with two quickfire strikes from Sadio Mane enough for the Premier League champions to pick up all three points.

Lampard has ambitions to close the gap on runaway favourites Liverpool and Manchester City, who were far the superior teams in the last campaign.
