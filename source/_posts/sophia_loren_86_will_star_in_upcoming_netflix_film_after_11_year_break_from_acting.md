Speaking of her excitement about the project she told Deadline: 'When my son proposed the role to me, it was a dream come true. 

'I jumped at the opportunity to make it. I loved portraying Madame Rosa. She is tough, she is fragile, she is a survivor. In many ways she reminds me of my own mother.' 

Last July, Sophia was spotted filming the movie in Bari, Italy, where she was seen looking dishevelled as she shot scenes being pushed around in a wheelchair by a child.
