The family of a father-of-three who was rammed by a police car and stomped in the face during a violent arrest have called for an independent investigation.

Disturbing footage shows the 32-year-old running from the Northern Hospital in the Melbourne suburb of Epping after 4pm on Sunday.

The roof plumber, who has bipolar disorder, was then sent flying after he was struck by a police car.

Six officers pounced on him, with one officer appearing to stomp on his head during the arrest.

His father Glen was furious about the incident that left his son in an induced coma with potential brain damage.

'They could've killed him. These people need to be held to justice and accountable. The police had no right to do what they did,' he told reporters on Monday.

Mr Atkins is calling on Victoria Police to sack the officer who allegedly kicked his son.

'It's disgusting,' he told 3AW.

'This bloke needs to be accountable. He needs to lose his job. Policemen like that should not be in the job.'

He explained his son, who is a successful business owner and just finished building his dream home, was suffering through his first bipolar episode in nine years. 

He had tried to admit himself to a psychiatric ward in the hospital on Saturday but was unable to secure a bed after a day-long wait.

'He called me on Saturday. He was crying and he wanted me to come in,' Glen said.

'I can't, because of the COVID thing, and he started crying on the phone.'

His son called his apprentice to pick him up before he ran out the front door of the hospital.

Glen said his son was considered to be a 'danger to himself' and doctors rang the police.  

He claimed the matter got out of hand when police arrived on scene and attempted to apprehend his son.

The man's family are still not allowed to see him as hospital are restricted for patients only to curb the spread of coronavirus in Melbourne.  

Eyewitnesses Jake Edwards and his partner George Michael were driving down Cooper St when they stopped and filmed the shocking incident. 

Mr Edwards described what they pair witnessed as 'unjustifiable' and 'disgusting' behaviour from Victoria Police.

'We've seen a police car ram into (the man) sending him flying a few metres across the road,' Mr Edwards recalled to Daily Mail Australia.

'He got up and the foot chase continued. They run up to the median strip (and) the man did throw a punch or two. 

'Then pepper spray was used, punches from the police were thrown. While they were bringing him down and he wasn't restrained yet there were kicks to the head.

'The worst part of it all is while he was restrained with five to six officers on him, there was a stomp to the head and then a knee to the head. Disgusting.' 

Outraged, the pair both posted their footage to Facebook where it was broadcast on last night's news.

Eventually the man's shocked wife contacted them on social media, trying to find out details of what had happened. 

In their video, one of the witnesses can be heard crying out: 'Are you f*****g kidding me?' 

A motorist yells at the police to stop kicking the man before the other witness urges him to be quiet. 

Victoria Police said the incident unfolded after officers were called over reports of a male behaving erratically about 4.10pm. 

'Upon arrival the male allegedly became aggressive and damaged a police vehicle whilst attempting to avoid arrest,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.  

'During the highly dynamic incident a police officer was assaulted and OC spray was deployed before the man was arrested and subsequently taken to hospital for assessment.'

The arrest has been referred to Professional Standards Command.
