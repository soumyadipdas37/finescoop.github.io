South Korean boy band ATEEZ are the latest ambassadors for the Polished Man charity.

The K-pop superstars were unveiled as Polished Man's ambassadors on Monday.

ATEEZ's leader Kim Hong Joong, 21, said in a statement: 'I had the chance to get to know about this campaign through other artists before my debut.'

He continued: 'And after hearing about the painful reality that a lot of children are going through, I thought that I also want to promote this campaign more to the public when I stand in front of the public too. 

'Just like how I have, it’s a campaign that you can easily participate in. I hope that more and many people will participate along with me.'

Polished Man is a charity aimed at ending violence against children.

To bring awareness to the cause, the 2020 Polished Man campaign asks people to paint one fingernail during the month of October. 

All funds raised for the cause are channelled into trauma recovery and the facilitation of trauma prevention for victims of family violence.

'It’s more meaningful for us because it’s a campaign that we’ve been interested in for a long time,' ATEEZ said in a statement.

'We are happy and proud to be able to take the lead in this meaningful campaign and prompt the fans and to the public. We will continue to work hard to become artists who exercise positive influence on many people.' 

'It’s more meaningful for us because it’s a campaign that we’ve been interested in for a long time,' ATEEZ said in a statement

Other celebrity ambassadors for Polished Man include Tommy Little, Brendan Fevola, and Matty 'J' Johnson. 

ATEEZ officially debuted in 2018 and have amassed quite a large Australian fanbase in the last two years.

The band have already performed in Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena and Sydney's Big Top, and even cracked Australia's ARIA chart last year.
