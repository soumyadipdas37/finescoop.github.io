The prosecutor who brought the case against Harry Maguire says he 'doubts' the footballer feared for his life during his arrest, as Greek police say they treated him 'like just another drunk Brit'.

The £85 million centre-half was last week convicted of assaulting police and attempted bribery after officers arrived to break up a brawl outside a bar on the island of Mykonos.

Mr Maguire, 27, insists that he was defending his sister Daisy, 20, from two Albanian men who injected her with a drug, claiming he thought he was being kidnapped by fake police and tried to run away 'in fear for his life' when the officers arrived. 

Now, appearing on Good Morning Britain today, prosecutor Ioannis Paradissis says police did identify themselves to Mr Maguire, who he claims is now using his fortune to evade responsibility for his actions. 

Mr Paradissis told the programme 'I doubt he feared for his life', adding: 'The policemen heard some kind of commotion, argument going on and they just went there to break up the argument, they just went there for help.'

The prosecutor also said eyewitness claimed officers immediately revealed they were from the police - something Mr Maguire says did not happen.

Maguire told the BBC in an explosive interview last week that he was defending his sister Daisy, 20, from two Albanian men who injected her with a drug

Harry Maguire, 27, claims the fight had broken out after his sister Daisy, 20, (pictured) was drugged 

When asked why the trial was over with so quickly, Mr Paradissis said: 'The initial trial lasted over six hours, which is an enormous amount of time for this kind of trial. 

'It was a simple kind of trial, it was just tourists having had a drink too much and misbehaving on vacation, attacking police and then trying t use their wealth to get out of what they've done.

'It was a simple case, it lasted six hours, there were eyewitnesses and this is why it happened so quickly, because all the evidence is there.' 

He later added: 'What has shocked people is they have tried to use their wealth, their position to get out of it, and this is quite shocking.'

The Manchester United captain has claimed that plain clothes officers refused to identify themselves during his arrest. 

Maguire told the BBC in an explosive interview last week he thought he was being kidnapped by fake police and tried to run away 'in fear for his life' when the officers arrived.

But one of the officers has poured scorn on the story told by the £190,000-per-week England player, telling The Sun: 'We didn't treat him differently to other drunk British guys. 

'This was just a drunk guy getting in a fight. We deal with it a lot. But it has turned into something else with everything he says.

'Why would eight police surround him and not identify themselves? We'd lose our jobs.' 

Prosecutor Mr Paradissis today revealed that he has been bombarded with threats and angry emails following the case. 

'I have been receiving hate mail, I have been receiving emails with threats,' he said.

'What I’d like to say to all the football fans is please stop sending me emails. 

'If you think I have offended you in any way I’m sorry. I respect Manchester United... it has been explained to me Harry Maguire is a great athlete... but please stop sending me emails.'  

It comes just days after Mr Maguire sat down for his first interview since he was handed the 21-month suspended prison sentence.

The England defender announced on Wednesday that he is appealing the decision made against him in a court on the island of Syros and now faces a retrial.

Mr Maguire, who asked the BBC to keep his current location secret, vowed to fight to clear his name and declared: 'I'm really confident the truth will be told.'

A shaken Mr Maguire said: 'My initial thought was that we are being kidnapped. We got on our knees and put our hands in the air and then they just started hitting us in the legs saying my career's over, no more football, you won't play again. 

'And at this point I thought there was no chance these are police, I don't know who they are, so I tried to run away, I feared for my life.' 

 The England star insisted he hadn't done anything wrong and didn't owe an apology 'to anybody', after the Greek prosecutor called for one. 

Mr Maguire said: 'I don't feel like I owe an apology to anybody, an apology is for when you've done something wrong.

'I regret being in the situation. Obviously the situation's made it difficult, I play for one of the biggest clubs in the world so I regret putting the fans and the club through this.'

The world's most expensive defender also denied claims he bribed police officers calling the statement read out in court 'ridiculous'.  

Mr Maguire was asked by the BBC's Dan Roan if he accepted that he was asking for trouble by going to a busy bar on the popular tourist island.  

He said: 'No it could have happened anywhere. I love Greece. I think footballers get a bit of stick for trying to stay away from everything, but its' not how I want to live my life.'  

The football star - who has been dropped from Gareth Southgate's England squad - described what it was like spending two nights in custody.

He said: 'It was horrible it's nothing I ever want to do again, I don't wish it on anybody. Its the first time I've ever been inside a prison.'
