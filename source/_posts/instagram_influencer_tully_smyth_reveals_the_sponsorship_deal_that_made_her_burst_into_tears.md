From vibrators to fashion, Tully Smyth has received a wide variety of social media sponsorships since becoming a professional influencer off the back of her Big Brother appearance in 2013.

But nothing could have prepared the 32-year-old for the 'weirdest' opportunity she has had yet, which sent her into 'a bit of a panic spiral'. 

Tully revealed on Tuesday, in the latest episode of her Too Much Tully podcast, that she 'burst into tears' when she received an email from a PR company asking her to team up with a fertility clinic.

The blonde bombshell, who was 31-years-old at the time, was propositioned to freeze her eggs and share the journey online.

Tully said she 'felt ambushed' by the idea as she was 'not ready to give up on my Pinterest dream of the husband and the white picket fence with 2.5 kids'.

And it also got her thinking: 'Should I be worried about freezing my eggs?' 

'The thought that this PR team was sitting around a desk on a Monday morning, spit balling who they could reach out to and my name was written on that white board,' Tully explained.

 '... oh that girl from Big Brother - she's been single for about seven years. She's sad and lonely. She's a spinster. She can't get a date. She wants babies.

'I was like, oh my god, a whole team has sat together and thought I'd be a great candidate and that is f***ing depressing.'

The opportunity, however, planted a 'seed' in Tully's mind, which was becoming more comfortable with the idea of motherhood as the months went on.

Tully now has 'a lot to think about' because she always dreamed about being a mum.

'I've never imagined my life without kids in it, and so I guess now it would be silly to at least look into my options and, I guess, egg freezing is one of them,' she said on Tuesday's episode of the podcast, which featured a fertility specialist.

She added in an Instagram post on Tuesday: 'Maybe it’s simply the fact that I am only weeks shy of my 33rd birthday and STILL haven’t met anyone who has blown my mind (to be fair, it’s been literally impossible, neigh, ILLEGAL to date this year, pretty much).'

'There were so many “OMG REALLY?” moments, I forgot we were recording and instead kept rattling off all my questions like “When is the best time to freeze your eggs?”, “When is it too late?” and “What happens if there is a blackout and the power gets cut off and the eggs go off like the 6 pack of sausages in my freezer?”' 

Fans reacted positively to Tully's opportunity and openness with the idea of freezing her eggs, with many sharing their own fertility journey and battle with conception.

'I was told two months ago that I was infertile due to the lack of eggs I had due to my endometriosis. From this discovery I've decided to do IVF by myself ... No man,' one woman posted. 

'I had always thought I'd have kids by now and had planned to freeze my eggs this year but COVID turned everything upside down. I do hope to freeze them in the next 18 months,' another wrote.

'It's definitely something I've considered leading up to 30 and no man around - to the point my family even mentions it to me,' a third fan messaged Tully.
