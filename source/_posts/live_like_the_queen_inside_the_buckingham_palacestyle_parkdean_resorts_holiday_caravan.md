Living like the Queen, it turns out, is cheaper than you might think.

A first-of-its-kind holiday caravan that's been designed to look just like Her Majesty's Buckingham Palace residence inside has been unveiled – and it only costs £13.25 per person per night.

It's called The Royal Caravan and features chandeliers in every room, two gold-plated toilets, custom gold and red-velvet thrones 'to command from', a master-bedroom four-poster bed with crown decoration – and for guests with corgis, a dog-friendly royal dog bed and gold-plated dog bowls.

The caravan is operated by Parkdean Resorts, which spent £100,000 on the Buckingham Palace-style makeover

The caravan, which is located in Cayton Bay, Scarborough, used to look a little more ordinary, of course, but Parkdean Resorts, which rents it out, gave it a £100,000 makeover to make it fit for royalty.

It's a static home that has 'sparkle like Markle', the company claims.

Guests-in-waiting can get a sneak peek of the splendour thanks to an MTV Cribs-style video that Parkdean Resorts produced, in which 'Queen Liz' shows viewers around.

She opens the fridge, as is tradition on MTV Cribs, and sits on the bed in the royal bedroom. 'This is not where the magic happens', she stresses.

During the tour, we see 'Kate and Wills' sorting out the dishes in the filigree-laced kitchen ('a haven that will turn any task into a fairytale') and relaxing on the terrace with cups of tea and Champagne, and get a peek inside 'William and Harry's room'.

We're also shown 'one's gold-plated lavatory'.
