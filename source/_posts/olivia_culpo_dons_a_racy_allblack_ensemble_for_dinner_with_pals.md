Olivia Culpo stepped out for dinner with pals on Wednesday night shortly after discussing her endometriosis diagnosis. 

The former Miss Universe, 28, donned an edgy all-black ensemble for the outing, during which she was joined by her pet dog and donned a face mask. 

It comes after she spoke to People about being nervous to share details of her condition, which is a disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that forms the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterine cavity.

Out and about: Olivia Culpo stepped out for dinner with pals on Wednesday night shortly after discussing her endometriosis diagnosis

Olivia looked incredible in a pair of cut-out leather trousers paired with a racy crop top which flashed an eye-popping peek of underboob.

The star, who recently starred on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, was putting on a racy display in the barely-there ensemble. 

The crop top featured a high neck yet exposed her skin from beneath as the cut-out under her cleavage bared her braless state in all its glory. 

Not content with just flashing her bust, she also gave a glimpse of her tanned hips as the high-waisted trousers featured large cut outs at the hips.

She wore her brunette locks in a loose down style while going for a neutral make-up look to best show off her pretty features. 

It was not just pals dining with Olivia as she also brought her beloved dog Oliver Sprinkles to the swanky eatery for a night out.  

Olivia first revealed last month on her Instagram Stories that she suffered from the typically painful disorder and now divulged further. 

In her interview with People, Olivia said: 'It was something that I was nervous to share because I really didn’t know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are...

'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods...

'They’re not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility.'

She revealed she has no plans for surgery at the moment and is currently going down the holisitic route in a bid to treat her condition. 

She said: 'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we’ll see. It’s a journey...

'Every month is different because I try different things every month...

'But I’ll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone’s different.'

She advised women to get their egg count checked and to make sure that painful periods aren't affecting either their ovaries or eggs.

'Down the line, it's so heartbreaking when you think about someone who maybe could have taken action earlier, and now they can't have children. 

'That to me just feels awful,' she said. 

Culpo also shared that she's been 'loving' celery juice in the morning, enjoying home workouts and trying to carve out time for regular meditation.

She's been dating pro football player Christian McCaffrey, 24, for about a year.
