As they attempt to extinguish the fire the ward is barely recognisable as it is completely clouded with smoke

One elderly woman is helped off her bed as the fire spreads, turning the room a luminous orange.

Two patients remain in the room as it starts filling with smoke, as hospital staff hurry them both to safety.  

The fire is extinguished and the ward is barely recognisable as it is completely clouded with smoke.   

It comes as the city’s coronavirus cases has topped 7,100 - after an additional 112 tested positive, according to figures from August 24.
