Jesy Nelson has finally watched her first ever Disney film, kicking off her journey into the movies with The Lion King.

The Little Mix star, 29, shared a snap to Instagram of her relaxing while the 1994 animated film played on a TV and showed characters Rafiki and baby Simba.

However fans were left baffled after the Holiday singer's revelation and struggled to comprehend how she had gone so long without watching any of the movies. 

Better late than never: Jesy Nelson has finally watched her first Disney movie after revealing she's watched The Lion King

In the short clip Jesy can be heard asking 'aw, is that Simba?' as the camera zooms in on the screen, proving that she's not well aquatinted with the classic.

The brunette beauty's fans were quick to react to the news, with many sharing their amazement that it's taken her almost 30 years to watch a Disney flick.

However others added that they were 'proud' of the star for eventually getting round to watching one of the company's features.

One wrote: 'This is not a drill - Jesy Nelson is finally watching a Disney movie'

'Aw, is that Simba?': During her movie night, Jesy could be heard asking is the baby lion was the film's main character

While another said: 'Jesy has just watched her first Disney movie and its 2020... SIS'

Jesy has mentioned her lack of interest in Disney films before, revealing in several interviews that she hasn't watched the films - but has seen Pixar's Toy Story.

When her band mates - Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock - have been asked to pick their favourite princesses in the past, Jesy has often stayed quiet and let them name one of the characters for her.

And in a past interview with Capital FM her bandmates joked that Jesy not having ever seen a Disney film was 'offensive'.









Shock: Little Mix fans were amazed at the revelation, with some adding that they were 'proud'

During the chat the four beauties were asked to sing the opening to The Circle Of Life, with Jesy managing to join in as she recognised the music.

However once they stopped making the tune, Perrie said 'can you believe she's never seen the Lion King? That's so offensive.'

Leigh-Anne was also aghast at the news, grabbing hold of Jesy's arm and saying 'wait, you've never seen The Lion King? Get out, get out!' 

It comes after Jade admitted that Little Mix were 'scared of p***ing anyone off' at the start of their career and that they did 'what we were told'.

New music! Little Mix recently announced that their sixth studio album will be called Confetti with a sizzling cover showing them covered in glitter 

The singer, 27, candidly discussed the group's journey in an interview with Radio Times alongside her bandmates.

Little Mix, who switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018, were originally formed on The X Factor in 2011.

Discussing the group's journey so far, Jade admitted during the interview that the group used to do 'what we were told' and were 'scared of p***ing anyone off'.

The singer also claimed that the music industry is 'very much dominated by older men'. 

Jade told Radio Times: 'At the beginning we were so scared of p***ing anyone off and damaging our career, so we did what we were told.

'We didn't even realise we had a choice, it was pitched as not having one, so you sign what you are told to and you go along with it. As the years went on, we started to realise we didn't like that.'

Little Mix are now preparing to release their record Confetti, which will be their sixth studio album after already releasing DNA, Salute, Get Weird, Glory Days and their most recent offering LM5 in 2018.
