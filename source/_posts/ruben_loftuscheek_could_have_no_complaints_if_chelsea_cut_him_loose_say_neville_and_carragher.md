Pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher believe Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has failed to make the most of his opportunities at Stamford Bridge. 

The English midfielder has had multiple injury setbacks, including a long spell on the sidelines from March 2019 to February of this year. 

Loftus-Cheek was given a starting berth by manager Frank Lampard on Monday night against Brighton but he was taken off after 61 minutes.

And former defenders Neville and Carragher believe he could have no complaints if Chelsea decided to offload him.  

'I thought Loftus-Cheek he's been given his chance,' Neville told Sky Sports.

'I thought he was really disappointing. I don't think Loftus-Cheek can complain. He's been given games.

'I don't think he's ever grasped his chance yet. There's going to come a point when they're going to cash in and get £25million for him.'

The Blues secured a 3-1 victory at Brighton in their opening game of the Premier League season with goals from Jorginho, Reece James and Kurt Zouma proving enough.

Loftus-Cheek showcased his burgeoning talent on loan at Crystal Palace in the 2017-18 campaign but Carragher agreed with his colleague that the 24-year-old has not seized his chances.

'When he was at Crystal Palace you thought what a player,' Carragher told Sky Sports. 

'He's got to say he wants to play every single week. He's not grabbed his chance tonight. If you get your chance you have to grab it. He's had his chances now.'
