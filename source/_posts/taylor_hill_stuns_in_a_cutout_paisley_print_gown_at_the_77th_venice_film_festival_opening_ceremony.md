The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It starts on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis, with temperature checks and mask wearing becoming mandatory. 

Taylor has been in Italy for the last few weeks, attending several shows during Milan Digital Fashion Week.

Taylor is an Illinois native, who grew up in Colorado, and was discovered by a fashion photographer when she was just 14. 

She kickstarted her modelling career by being featured in an Intimissimi's catalogue in 2013, which led to a print campaign in Forever 21.

Since then, she went on to become a popular Victoria's Secret Angel, beginning in 2015, and has appeared in many of the top high-fashion publications and fashion shows around the world.
