Beaches and parks throughout Sydney will implement COVID-safe protocols this summer. 

One of the NSW government's proposed rules will be for beachgoers to maintain a 'towel length' of distance among themselves.

Under the plan, markings will also be placed throughout parks and public spaces to remind people of social distancing policies.

Lifeguards would set up several sets of flags across long stretches of beach - subject to weather conditions - to encourage beachgoers to distance.

'We know how much our community loves fresh air, beaches and parklands, but we will all need to do that a bit differently this summer,' Premier Gladys Berejiklian said

Venues will also be encouraged to embrace alfresco dining to promote social distancing and avoid placing too many people in confined spaces.

The proposals are part of a five-point plan to ensure the safety of Sydneysiders this summer.    

'We know how much our community loves fresh air, beaches and parklands, but we will all need to do that a bit differently this summer,' Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

In addition to the five-point plan, Ms Berejiklian is hoping to launch arts and cultural events outdoors to aid in contact tracing.

'Whatever you're into there'll be something for you to do this summer,' Planning Minister Rob Stokes said.

Mr Stokes said he hoped people would stray from the standard Aussie tradition of crowding at the beach this summer and begin exploring lesser known parts of Sydney.

Under the plan, markings will also be placed throughout parks and public spaces to remind people of social distancing policies

Venues will also be encouraged to embrace alfresco dining, again to promote social distancing and avoid placing too many people in confined spaces

'We have huge amounts of open space, but often we don't even know exactly where it is in a local community,' Mr Stokes said.

'So we're going to shine a spotlight on all the forgotten bits of parkland right across this beautiful city.' 

QR sign in codes would still be required when dining out, and could even be extended to taxi trips in the coming weeks, Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant revealed on Sunday.

Sitting in the front seat of a ride-share service is already discouraged to avoid any close contact.  

It comes as the state recorded just one new locally acquired COVID-19 case.

The case is a household contact of a previously known case linked to Concord Hospital, and was already in quarantine prior to testing positive.   

Back in April, crowds were criticised for gathering and doing the coastal walk in Manly despite social distancing rules
