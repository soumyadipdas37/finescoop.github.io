Irina Shayk gave her more than 13.9 million Instagram followers an intimate look at her bedroom, as she posed for a sultry mirror selfie on Sunday morning. 

The 34-year-old supermodel showcased her gym-honed midriff and incredible legs as she snapped the shot wearing a black-and-white lace lingerie set.   

Posing with one hand in her tousled bun, she put on a busty display in her signature Intimissimi triangle bra and matching underwear.

The model styled her brunette locks into a sweptback blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous makeup to enhance her stunning features. 

Behind her, fans got a glimpse of her minimalist bedroom, which included a black and white blanket, a fiddle-leaf fig in the corner and white carpet over her light wood floors.

On her Instagram Story, the Vogue cover girl cozied up to pals Stella Maxwell and Ben Schwerin on a brown leather couch in a NYC apartment.

The trio appeared at ease, as the Russian bombshell placed her legs atop Maxwell in a pair of bright orange shorts and a loose-fitting, grey sweatshirt. 

For their picture, the Victoria's Secret Angel smoldered at the camera, sporting an oversized denim jacket, a choker necklace and her blonde tresses pulled back. 

Meanwhile,  the mother-of-one maintained a soft pout and kept her arms crossed.

Shayk's sighting comes after a slew of platonic reunions with her ex Bradley Cooper, who is the father of her three-year-old daughter Lea. 

The former couple have been making the most of their time together, as they were photographed together on Tuesday and Thursday.

Bradley and Irina began dating in 2015. Lea was born in 2017, but they called it quits in June 2019.

The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.

'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she's back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March.

'He's been making an effort to take projects that aren't too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he's very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he'd carry her everywhere.' 

Rumours: It comes after Irina and art dealer Vito Schnabel continued to spark relationship rumours over the weekend 

'He's totally devoted to Lea, it's really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.

He's been back in NYC after spending time in Southern California shooting a yet-to-be-titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.  

She has been spotted several times with her potential new boyfriend Vito Schnabel, who is a longtime pal and previously dated Heidi Klum.
