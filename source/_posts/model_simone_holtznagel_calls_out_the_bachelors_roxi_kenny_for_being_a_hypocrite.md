Roxi Kenny and Locky Gilbert shared a steamy kiss on Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor. 

But Australian model Simone Holtznagel has slammed the reality star on Twitter for being a hypocrite after she previously called out Kaitlyn Hoppe for kissing the 31-year-old.   

'I'd just like to take this time to point out that just the other week, Roxi, sl*t shamed another contestant for giving Locky a kiss on the mouth. The hypocrisy #TheBachelorAU,' she wrote.

Harsh words: Simone took to Twitter to share her frustration over Roxi's behaviour on Wednesday night's episode  

Fans flocked to Twitter to agree with Simone's statement, calling out Roxi for being jealous. 

'Roxi being "a little bit jealous" might just be the understatement of the millennium,' wrote one user. 

Another wrote: 'Whose [sic] Roxi kidding, she got jealous when Locky sat next to Bella lol.' 



Reaction: Fans flocked to Twitter to agree with Simone's statement calling out Roxi for being jealous 

Of course, there were some who came to her defence, with one saying that the negative comments made them 'uncomfortable'. 

'Feeling pretty uncomfortable over the trolling and hate towards Roxi. You'd think as audiences we would realise by now how integral editing is to the way someone is portrayed in TV,' they wrote.

'Have we not learnt from the last 20 years of reality TV?'

Last week, Roxi, became furious after learning that Kaitlyn, 26, had kissed Locky earlier in the evening.

At one stage, she said within earshot of Kaitlyn: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.

'That's classless. She's Gold Coast trash. This little silly b***h over here is saying she pecked on with someone. It's disgusting. The b***h is a sl*t.'

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
