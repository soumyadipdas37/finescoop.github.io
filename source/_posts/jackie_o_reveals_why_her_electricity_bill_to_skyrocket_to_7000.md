Jackie 'O' Henderson is no stranger to living a luxurious life.

But one basic creature comfort once cost the radio host a whopping $7,000.

The KIIS FM star left her underfloor heating on for three months straight, leading to one very expensive electricity bill. 

Living luxuriously: On Thursday, Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed the luxurious 'waste of money' she barely used  that caused her electricity bill to skyrocket to $7,000

Jackie explained that the incident occurred during the winter months at the luxurious Bondi apartment she recently moved out of.  

'I had the underfloor heating on for three months solid through winter, never turned it off once,' she explained during segment on Thursday's Kyle and Jackie O show. 

'In the morning I wake up, I go to the kitchen to make a cup of tea, before I put my slippers on and it's really nice to have the floor warm at that point in time.' 

That's rich! The KIIS FM star revealed she left her under floor heating on for three months straight in her Bondi apartment. Jackie said: 'I had the under floor heating on for three months solid through winter, never turned it off once'

Jackie said she had no idea that the heating was so expensive. 

'You freaked out when you saw the electricity bill.' Kyle asked.

'Yeah $7,000,' she replied, leaving both the shock jock and newsreader Brooklyn Ross shocked.  

Costly creature comforts: Jackie added that she had no idea that under floor heating was an expensive luxury. She called it a 'waste of money' because she is rarely is barefoot in her home. Pictured is Jackie with her daughter Kitty in their apartment with a puppy

'Yes, I died, I was like "oh my god, why is this so expensive?"' she added. 

'Because you left it on for three months day and night?' Kyle concluded. 

'It's like a big heater underneath the tiles, all over the house, like a house-size heater on 24/7' he added, telling his radio co-host she should have known better. 

Bill shock! Kyle pointed out that her use of the heater only amounted to a short amount of time during the week and said: 'You freaked out when you saw the electricity bill.' 'Yeah $7,000,' she revealed, which left Kyle (pictured) and newsreader Brooklyn Ross (background) shocked

Jackie has since moved to an $11m home in the leafy suburb of Woollahra, which also has underfloor heating.

'Now I've got underfloor heating at this new place, and I haven't touched that obviously,' she joked.

'Give her a while, she's only been there three days,' Kyle said with a laugh. 

'She's only been there three days': Jackie, who has since moved to an $11m home in Woollahra, which also has under floor heating, said she won't be turning on the heating feature. But Kyle joked she would have it on in no time
