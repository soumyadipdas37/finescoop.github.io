Even though it's barely October, Carrie Underwood cannot help to get excited about Christmas. 

On Friday, the 37-year-old country sensation released her very first Christmas album, My Gift and it features a special surprise which she could not help but gush over. 

Making his singing debut on the album is Carrie's five-year-old son, Isaiah who croons alongside his mother on her track Little Drummer Boy.

My Gift: Carrie Underwood, 37, released her debut Christmas album on Friday, sharing that her five-year-old son, Isaiah, who she shares with husband Mike Fisher, appears on her track Little Drummer Boy. Appearing on Today ahead of the release Carrie joked she was a 'stage mom'

The album features the young boy who clearly caught the musical gene from his Grammy award winning mother. 

In an Instagram post from August, Underwood shared that John Legend would also be featured on the album before calling her son Isaiah, 'my own little drummer boy' as she announced the special mother-son collaboration.  

Carrie took to social media to revel in the excitement of her debut holiday album, also sharing to Twitter that the record would be getting a live special through HBO Max.  

Teasing the holiday album, she appeared yesterday on Today joking she was a 'stage mom' throughout the process.

'Whenever I think about that song I picture his face and his personality, that is so him. He would be the kid that would make you something and bring it to you because that's what he had to give you and that's the whole sentiment behind Little Drummer Boy,' she said. 

She added, 'Isaiah did such a good job on that song, I was the proudest mom in the world.'

When jokingly asked if she had any stage mom tendencies, Carrie said: 'I did feel like I was a little bit, I was in the booth with him, trying to get him to access all his little five-year-old emotions which he could do on his own but...He was just so expressive. When I heard the song back...I was laughing and crying, just so many emotions - I was so proud of him.'

One Instagram user was quick to give her adoring feedback on the track, writing, 'Little Drummer Boy just melted my heart! It is the cutest thing I have ever heard and it’s even more special that it’s your son.'

Speaking about making the album during the pandemic Carrie shared that they were lucky enough to start it at the end of last year though they did continue to re-work the album via zoom. 

She also shared that she really wanted to finish the project in time for this season as she wanted to give people something to be happy about, allowing them to focus on the 'good', despite the last year. 

Just last week, Carrie was awarded the honor of ACM Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards which makes her the first female country artist to win the honor for the third time. 

Amid all her successes, Carrie also mentioned her involvement in a holiday gift drive to underprivileged schools in her hometown of Oklahoma.

'Schools need chrome books - they don't know what's going to happen with the pandemic and they need gifts,' she said on Today. 

 When asked how her family was faring in the pandemic, Carrie shared: 

'We're good, we're really lucky we have some space that we've been utilizing. We've been outdoors a lot...it's been good, they're adventurous little boys. I've never been in one place for this long in the past 15+ years of my career.' 

When it comes to her precious sons, she added 'It's great to get to know them and watch them grow...I'm never gonna get it back.' 

The Jesus Take The Wheel singer and her retired NHL husband Mike Fisher, 40, also recently celebrated their 10 year anniversary. 

Her debut Christmas album My Gift! is out now.
