Kate Middleton donned a pair of £44 delicate gold earrings gifted to her by a female designer as she visited a London Scouts Group yesterday.

The Duchess of Cambridge, 38, dressed down in jeans, a favourite gilet and added a touch of glamour with the gold hoops from All The Falling Stars to meet Cub and Beaver Scouts in Northolt, west London.

The £44 earrings were crafted by Irish designer Aisling O'Brien and gifted to the Duchess during her visit to Ireland at the start of the year.

Online, the brand is described as 'including pieces that are modern and simple, designed to let the wearer’s natural beauty shine.'

The mother-of-three kept her make up natural for the occasion and wore her hair in a bouncy blow dry, occasionally tucking her hair behind her ear to reveal the stunning set. 

The Duchess is known for her love of affordable jewellery, and often selects earrings by high street brands including Accessorize. 

But it's not the first time she has worn the affordable independent Irish jewellery brand.

Last week she stepped out in a personalised gold necklace from the brand engraved with the letters 'G, L, C' in honour of her children, Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two, for an outing in Battersea Park.

The pieces were commissioned in March, with the Duchess going on to write a note of thanks to Aisling expressing her gratitude and love for the pieces.

The brand is described as specialising in 'delicate and minimalist' jewellery, with collections featuring modern and simple pieces which 'let the wearer’s natural beauty shine'.  

Yesterday, the Duchess paired the stunning earrings with herSpells of Love Double Strand Beaded Satellite Chain Necklace, which costs £85.

 The brand is described online as crafting pieces with a mix of 'bohemian feminine influence' and 'trend-led modern aesthetic', with a focus on 'ethical production'.

It's not the first time the Duchess has worn the brand, after she stepped out in a personalised necklace by the company while meeting fellow parents in a London park last week 

It was launched in August 2019, and has since become a favourite for British reality stars and models including Emma Louise Connelly, MIC's Sophie Habbo and TOWIE's Chloe Lewis.

The pieces are described as being 'designed with love and intention' and 'mix bohemian feminine influence with trend led and modern aesthetic'.

The Duchess, who previously volunteered with the Scouts and was a Brownie growing up, joined the children in toasting marshmallows and writing letters to send to care home residents during the outdoor engagement yesterday in London.

The Duchess of Cambridge opted for the gold necklace engraved with the letters 'G, L, C' in honour of her children, Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two for the outing in Battersea Park last week 

The visit coincided with Kate being named joint president of the Scouts. Kate is sharing the position - her first presidency of an organisation - with the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, who has been president of the youth movement since 1975.  

The Duchess was presented with the Silver Wolf Award, the highest award made by The Scout Association which the Duke of Kent also holds.
