The Queen's cousin Lady Tatiana Mountbatten has shared a glimpse into her glamorous girl's holiday in Corfu.

Lady Tatiana, 30, who lives in Chelsea, is the daughter of the 4th Marquess of Milford Haven and the 94-year-old monarch's second cousin.

The socialite is currently lapping up the sunshine on the Greek island, where she's enjoying the culture, the food, and the scenery with a group of friends including Lady Violet Manners, and sharing snaps of their adventures on Instagram. 

The group drank Aperol spritz cocktails in a clifftop bar and dined out on mussels in the sunshine, while Tatiana showed off an enviable selection of swimsuits as she relaxed on the getaway.

The royal posted enviable snapshots as she enjoyed cocktails at a clifftop bar and dined out on mussels during the glamorous getaway 

The royal went on to share other snapshots as she lapped up the sunshine while on the luxurious break 

Sharing snaps of a restaurant on the trip, Lady Tatiana posted: 'Every night is date night. This place is my favourite.' 

Meanwhile she posted another picture as she relaxed in the sunshine, writing: 'Classic riders tan. Brown arms and paper white legs and a bruised knee.'

Other snapshots showed her jogging through the warm Corfu sunshine as she wrote: 'Running off the hangover.' 

Lady Tatiana was appointed as an ambassador to the 'quintessential luxury British fashion' brand Crofton & Hall last year. 

The royal has shared a number of enviable pictures on her Instagram page as she explored the Greek landscape 

Tatiana was joined by a selection of friends on the trip away, with the group sharing laughs as they lapped up the sunshine 

The horse rider, who trained under Olympian Charlotte Dujardin, is the daughter of Lord Milford Haven, who is a cousin of the Queen's, making Lady Tatiana a second cousin of Her Majesty.

Lady Tatiana was educated at the elite £12,000-a year Millfield private school in Street, Somerset.

Horse-mad Lady Tatiana once wanted to be a ski instructor, but now works training dressage horses.

Her polo-playing father George swelled his fortune by founding and selling price-comparison company uSwitch, and is thought to live in Switzerland.

The royal shared pictures with her Instagram followers as she dined out in the Greek sunshine and relaxed by the pool 

After stints in Denmark and Germany, Tatty has settled in London, where she runs a very smart horse yard.

Her personal website reads: 'All you really need to know is that I spend every day doing what I love more than anything in the world; riding horses.

'I'm a professional dressage rider based in Windsor. Here, I train a couple of my own horses and some horses which have been put in training with me by some wonderful people who have trusted me with the education and career of their horse.

'I hold monthly dressage clinics at home in West Sussex, Great Trippetts Polo Club to be more precise.'
