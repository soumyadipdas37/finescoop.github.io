Chelsea confirmed the signing of Bayer Leverkusen Kai Havertz on Friday night - but spelt the player's name wrong in the transfer announcement.

The Blues signed the 21-year-old forward for a fee believed to be around £89million in total to take their summer spending to around £230million. 

But the west London club's media team forgot to use their spell check as they called the German international 'Kia' instead of 'Kai' on their official website.

The statement read: 'The Blues have completed the signing of our second German international this summer with Kia Havertz putting his signature on a five-year contract'. 

Chelsea's interest in Havertz has been long-standing, with the negotiations of the deal drawn out across the entire summer transfer window so far. 

The announcement of the German international's new club would have been planned for weeks by the Chelsea media team but they still managed to let the error slip through.  

Other parts of the Havertz reveal showed him holding the Chelsea shirt alongside head coach Frank Lampard at Stamford Bridge as the player switches Germany for England.

Chelsea fans noticed the blunder on social media, though the majority of the Blues supporters poked fun at the situation. 

One user said: 'Can't wait for Kia Havertz to play alongside Honda Ziyech, Chevrolet Pulisic and Tesla Werner'

Another tweeted: Kia Havertz?!?!?! Seriously @ChelseaFC?!?! C’mon man.'

One supporter asked: 'Who's Kai??? Chelsea just signed Kia Havertz. Probably a sponsorship deal with the car company Kia Motors'

Havertz becomes Chelsea's sixth major signing of an incredible transfer window, which has also seen RB Leipzig forward and fellow Germany international Timo Werner also come through the door.

Ajax winger Hakim Ziyech also arrived earlier this year while defenders Thiago Silva, Ben Chilwell and Malang Sarr have also joined the west Londoners.

Upon signing for the Blues, Havertz said: 'I am very happy and proud to be here. For me it is a dream come true to play in a big club like Chelsea and I can't wait to meet all the players and the trainers. Yeah, I am very happy to be here!'
