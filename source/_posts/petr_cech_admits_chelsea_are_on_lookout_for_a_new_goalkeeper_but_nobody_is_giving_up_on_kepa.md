Chelsea legend Petr Cech has hinted that Chelsea could sign a new goalkeeper but has insisted the club have not given up on Kepa Arrizabalaga.

The Spaniard had a poor 2019-20 season in which he was dropped numerous times by manager Frank Lampard, including for the FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal.

This has resulted in speculation that the 25-year-old could be sold during the summer transfer window.

Petr Cech has claimed that Chelsea might buy a new keeper but haven't given up on Kepa

Speaking to Sport.CZ, Cech who is now a technical and performance advisor at Stamford Bridge said: 'Kepa struggled last season, that is unquestionable.

'But the club invested in him and gave him a long-term contract because they believe he has the qualities and attributes to be successful.

'Additions will be made to the squad, perhaps even in goal, and this is what is being discussed now.

'But nobody is giving up on Kepa and we all hope he has a great future.'

Cech is one of Chelsea's greatest goalkeepers, winning four Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy during his 11-years spent at the club.

There were high hopes for Arrizabalaga after he joined Stamford Bridge for £71m in August 2018, though his performances have failed to match his hefty transfer fee.

The Spaniard has four-years left on a £150,000-a-week contract and it is believed that Kepa is keen to fight for his position at Chelsea.

Chelsea have been linked with several goalkeepers over the summer including Jan Oblak, Edouard Mendy, Nick Pope and Dean Henderson.

Frank Lampard's side have splashed out the cash spending £136m on Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva, with Kai Havertz also expected to join the club.
