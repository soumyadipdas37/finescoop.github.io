The Independent elected Mayor of Middlesbrough is refusing to lockdown his city in direct defiance of the Government's new coronavirus restrictions.   

In a video statement, Andy Preston said: 'I have to tell you I think this measure has been introduced based on factual inaccuracies and a monstrous and frightening lack of communication, and ignorance. 

'I do not accept the statement at all. I do not accept these measures.

'We need to talk to government, they need to understand our local knowledge, expertise and ability to get things done, and preserve jobs and well-being.

'We are really disappointed. As things stand, we defy the Government and we do not accept these measures.

'We need to get Covid under control and we need to work with people to find a way of preserving jobs and mental health.'

Mr Preston had previously called for a ban on households mixing in private, but he fell short of asking for the same measures in public venues such as pubs and restaurants.

Matt Hancock has announced that Middlesbrough and Hartlepool should face the same restrictions as elsewhere in the North East - including not to mix households in pubs.
