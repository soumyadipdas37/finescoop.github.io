Karl Stefanovic may have recently signed a new contract with Channel Nine. 

But his co-host Ally Langdon has playfully suggested the veteran presenter, 46, should start to consider his retirement plan.  

On Tuesday, 41-year-old Ally couldn't resist taking a jab at Karl's age following a segment about elderly people continuing to work throughout their sunset years.   

'You're not far from 50,' Ally told Karl during the frosty on-air exchange.  

Taken aback by the brazen statement, Karl responded: 'You want to get me out the door now? I can go now if you like.' 

Giggling, Ally assured him: 'I am happy for you to stay until you're 50.'

This only made things more awkward, as an offended Karl hit back: 'That's only a couple of years... Ok, no problems. Nice to be welcomed.'  

'No! I'm just saying it's nice to know you've got options!' Ally chuckled.  

Karl appeared momentarily gobsmacked as crew members could be heard laughing in the background.

The playful sledging continued when Karl accused Ally of 'waking up funny this morning'. 

'I just think you're being very sensitive this morning!' teased the blonde.  

Karl then attempted to recruit sports presenter Alex Cullen to back up him up, but the 39-year-old made it clear he wasn't interested in confrontation.  

'Totes awks': Karl appeared momentarily gobsmacked as crew members could be heard laughing in the background 

'Alex, how have you found it?' probed Karl, prompting the reporter to turn away and pick up his mobile phone. 

 'I tend to agree. I will be on my phone now...' he muttered, staring down at the screen. 

'It's been a little by awks. Totes awks,' Karl concluded, shuffling his papers. 

The term 'totes awks' is a phrase mostly used by millennials (people aged between 24 to 39) meaning 'totally awkward'. 

He's not going anywhere... for now! Karl signed a new contract with Channel Nine on Saturday, with reports claiming he is set to remain at the network until at least 2023
