The 45-year-old Queensland electrician-turned-reality star uploaded an X-rated nude picture of himself on Instagram, before quickly deleting it after about 30 minutes. 

In the picture, Mike was seen completely naked, with just his hand covering his private parts.

Mike has been away from the spotlight following his time on the Channel Nine hit show.

He was most recently in a romance with busty blonde trucker, Jessica Williamson, last year. 

On his season of Married At First Sight he was matched with radio star Heidi Latcham, but the couple fizzled after moving in together.

Speaking about his part relationship, he told 9Honey last year that he will always have feelings for the radio presenter.

'If she walked in here now, my knees would go weak, such was her effect on me,' he said.

'I mean, I'm only a man. As long as I have blood coursing through my veins I will probably always find her attractive.'

In April last year, Mike revealed details of his split with Heidi, saying they broke-up shortly after she moved in with him on the Gold Coast.

He claimed he 'couldn't make Heidi happy' when they lived under the same roof.

The tattooed tradesman added that their break-up was 'painful' and that he missed Heidi after they parted ways.
