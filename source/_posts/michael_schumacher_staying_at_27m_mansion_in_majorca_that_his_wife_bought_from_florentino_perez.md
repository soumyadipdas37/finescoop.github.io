Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is reportedly spending time at a luxury villa in Majorca his wife bought three years ago from Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.

The seven-time world champion has been moved to the exclusive property on the upmarket estate of Las Brisas near Andratx in the south-west of the island from his Swiss home, Spanish press say.

The mansion where the 51-year-old is battling to get better has been identified as Villa Yasmin, which Corinna Schumacher is said to have purchased in 2017.

Michael (right before his accident) and his wife (left) previously owned a villa on the island and are thought to have holidayed there regularly before his devastating skiing accident in 2013

Spanish press including respected Majorcan daily Diario de Mallorca and Catalan daily La Vanguardia published their reports after ex-Formula 1 team boss and former QPR co-owner Flavio Briatore's ex-wife Elisabetta Gregoraci claimed: 'Michael doesn't speak, he communicates with his eyes.

'Only three people can visit him and I know who they are.'

Speaking on the Italian version of Big Brother the brunette added, in comments echoed by Spanish press: 'They moved to Spain and his wife has set up a hospital in that house.'

German tabloid Bild first linked the F1 legend to Florentino Perez's Majorca mansion in July 2018, saying Corinna had purchased it for £27m so she could spend holidays there with her children and friends.

The house was bought by Perez in 2005 but he sold it in 2017 following the death of his wife

The house was bought by building magnate Perez in 2005 but he put it up for sale in 2017 after the death of his wife Mari Angeles Sandoval.

The villa is part of a 15,000 square metre estate which boasts two swimming pools, a helipad, a gym and a huge palm-tree-fringed garden.

Schumacher, the only driver in history to win seven F1 World Championships, was placed in a medically-induced coma after a life-threatening skiing accident in December 2013 in the French Alps.

He was relocated to the family home on the shores of Lake Geneva in September 2014.

Updates on his health have been few and far between.

Renowned neurosurgeon Erich Riederer claimed last week there was little chance Schumacher would ever make a full recovery.

The surgeon, thought to have been giving his opinion as an outsider, said in a documentary on French television station TMC: 'I think he's in a vegetative state, which means he's awake but not responding.

'He is breathing, his heart is beating, he can probably sit up and take baby steps with help, but no more.

'I think that's the maximum for him. Is there any chance of seeing him like he was before his accident? I really don't think so.'

Riederer's interview came shortly after ex-Ferrari boss Jean Todt revealed he had visited Schumacher at his Swiss home and said: 'He is fighting. I hope the world will be able to see him again.

'This is what he and his family are working towards.'

The F1 legend's health has been shrouded in secrecy since his near-fatal brain injury in 2013 after falling and cracking his head while skiing off-piste.

He left Grenoble Hospital in June 2014 after regaining consciousness for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland before leaving to continue his recovery at home.
