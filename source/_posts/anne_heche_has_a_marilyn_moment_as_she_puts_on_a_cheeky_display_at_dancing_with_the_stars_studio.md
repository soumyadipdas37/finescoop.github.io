Anne Heche has been serving some impressive moves on this season of Dancing with the Stars.

And the Daytime Emmy winner is showing off her skills in and out of the studio, while rehearsing for the next show.

She had a Marilyn moment Friday in a chic floral wrap dress, as she put on a cheeky display, while arriving at the CBS studios to work on her routine with partner Keo Motsepe.

The 51-year-old left little to the imagination, as she twirled the skirt of her pink dress, showing off some white lace underwear and a heart tattoo on her upper thigh.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of chunky nude cat-eye sunglasses, an iridescent face mask, gold necklaces and tan leather laced-up high heeled booties.

Heche carried a can of Red Bull into the studio, with a black and burgundy leather handbag, featuring a beige handle, draped over her arm. 

She later took to her Instagram Story to show off the pink floral Kolbo dress, as she posed on the patio of her Los Angeles home.

Disney princess: The Psycho actress is preparing for week three, when she and Motsepe, 30, will perform a routine of Zero to Hero from Hercules for Disney Night

The Psycho actress is preparing for week three, when she and Motsepe, 30, will perform a routine of Zero to Hero from Hercules for Disney Night.

She previously admitted that she felt in over her head, coming into season 29 of the popular competition series.

Heche told Hollywood Outbreak earlier this week: 'I love to dance on the dance floor. I love to move, and I love to dance. I've never had a professional lesson before, 

'But before I got here and really learned what dancing is, I probably would have said, "Yea man, I look great on a dance floor. What are you talking about? I can move."

'Then, cut to, "I can't move. What are you talking about? What is ballroom? I don't know or care to think about how complicated the cha-cha or rumba, la-di-da is." So, time's changed very quickly from "yea, I'm awesome" to "no, I'm not awesome."'
