A promotional video for a Mazda dealership in Queensland has been ridiculed after copying TikTok's viral 'Savage' dance.  

Grand Prix Mazda Aspley, in Brisbane, posted the ad to social media on September 17 and declared 'September's Savage' would be a month packed with savings.  

The video showed three staff members performing the choreographed dance routine while one of them promoted the sale. 

But the ad was immediately slammed by perplexed social media viewers, who declared the marketing idea missed the mark.  

'Omg I don't know what's worse, that the company think this marketing works or the fact these people actually did this,' one Facebook user wrote.

Another said: 'Why do I feel like a middle aged man named Greg thought this would be a good idea? 

'Probably saw his niece watching it on TikTok and thought it was an excellent sales pitch.' 

Some social media viewers said the footage turned them off Mazda vehicles forever.  

'Is there a firing squad behind that camera? That is literally the only logical thing I could think of,' an amused Facebook user wrote.

'Unfortunately this ad has made me never want to buy a Mazda for as long as I live,' another added.

Others went so far as to say they wanted to return or sell their cars.

'Y'all just made me want to sell my Mazda,' one customer joked.

'Oh dear I bought my cars from these guys, I can't even watch the whole thing,' another replied.

It wasn't all bad for the dealership, with some viewers throwing their support behind the creative advertising.

'Marketing strategy is working, as funny and awkward these ads are, they are actually working,' one Facebook user wrote. 

The video has been shared almost 2,000 times and has received more than 6,000 comments. 

The 'Savage Challenge' swept video-sharing platform TikTok at the beginning of the year, with users performing the viral dance to Megan Thee Stallion's single Savage.
