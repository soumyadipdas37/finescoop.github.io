Bargain-hunting shoppers will be spoiled for choice this Christmas thanks to hundreds of discounted products at Coles and Woolworths.

Australia's leading supermarket chains are locked in a fierce price war as they vie for customers in the run-up to the 2020 festive season, the country's first in recession in 29 years.

Woolworths will drop prices on more than 140 items in-store and online from Wednesday, September 30, while Coles has already reduced 190 of its best-sellers.

Jars of cranberry sauce are down to $2.50 in both stores, but Coles is $5 cheaper for tiger prawns while Woolworths narrowly comes out on top for mince pies.

Battle of the supermarkets: Coles and Woolworths have discounted hundreds of items in the run up to Christmas, including festive favourites like cranberry sauce, prawns and mince pies

Dozens of festive favourites have been discounted, with six-packs of own-brand mince pies down from $2 to $1.80 at Coles and $1.70 to $1.50 at Woolworths. 

Lunchtime seafood is cheaper than ever, with kilos of black tiger prawns down from $28 to $22 at Coles and $30 to $27 at Woolworths.

The cost of cranberry sauce has also been cut, with jars marked down from $2.65 to $2.50 in both supermarkets.

Coles Chief Executive of Commercial and Express Greg Davis said the company recognises the growing need for affordable products as Australia's unemployment figure hovers around 920,000 or 6.8 percent.

'We're committed to lowering the cost of Christmas, as we know it's more important than ever,' he said.
