A postmortem examination found the cause of death was hanging and the coroner ruled the mother's death as suicide.  

Mandy's funeral took place in her home town on June 15 at Durrington Cemetery Chapel, according to The Sun newspaper.

The mother had appeared on TLC's Extraordinary Pregnancies with her husband Nathan four years ago in 2016.  

At the time of recording, the couple had 11 children and were looking forward to welcoming their 12th baby into the family. 

In the program proud mother Mandy said she loved children and the more children the pair had the more they wanted. She gave birth to her 13th child two years ago.     

She said: 'There are times when it can be absolute bedlam; they'll be dogs running around, kids chasing the dogs, adults chasing the kids that are chasing the dogs!'
