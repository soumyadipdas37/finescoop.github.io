Micah Richards has scolded Manchester City for their 'embarrassing' performance after they were put to the sword by Leicester in a 5-2 drubbing on home soil.

Jamie Vardy's hat-trick, James Maddison's stunner and a Youri Tielemans penalty saw Leicester claim their first win at the Etihad Stadium since their title winning 2015/16 season.

Riyad Mahrez and Nathan Ake scored the two goals for Pep Guardiola's men, with the latter representing the defensive reinforcements Man City have made this summer.

But former City defender and Sportsmail columnist Richards believes the problem in conceding goals also lies in midfield and believes Rodri has not shown he is capable of performing the role of Fernandinho. 

'I'm low. City have become a possession based team,' Richards told Sky Sports after the game.

'Everyone talks about Rodri and his pass completion, but the balls he plays are five yards in front, to the side.

Richards believes Rodri is not able to detect danger quite like midfield team-mate Fernandinho

'As soon as Fernandinho went off the pitch, I knew that would happen without protection. 

'In the middle by himself, Rodri doesn't read danger like Fernandinho and they get exposed. 

'The defence was a shambles, conceding five goals here is embarrassing. Too weak.'

According to Opta, Pep Guardiola has seen his side concede five goals for the first time in 686 games as a manager. 

The same source claims it is also the first time in 438 games at the Etihad Stadium that Man City have shipped five goals in any competition.
