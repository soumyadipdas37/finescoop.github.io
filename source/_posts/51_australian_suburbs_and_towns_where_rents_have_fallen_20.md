Rents have been slashed by a fifth in dozens of towns and suburbs across Australia with some surprising locations on the list. 

Sydney and Melbourne have seen six per cent falls in apartment rental prices on average in the last 12 months, based on the most recent figures.

Darwin has seen the biggest drop in house rental prices with an average six percent, followed by Sydney with five per cent. 

And in 51 suburbs rental prices plummeted by more than 20 per cent while another 200 have seen a reduction of at least 10 per cent, according to Finder. 

New South Wales dominates the list with 30 of the 51 locations.

The list of 51 locations where rents plummeted by 20 per cent has been revealed. Pictured is Forresters Beach on the NSW Central Coast

Pockets of Sydney's south-west where unit prices have dipped by 20 per cent include Canley Heights, Villawood and Edensor Park, along with West Pennant Hills and Dean Park in the north-west.

Pagewood in Sydney's south, Forresters Beach on the NSW Central Coast and Eden in the state's far south have also seen dramatic reductions.

A host of Sydney suburbs with waterside views head the list of the highest reductions in house rent prices including Cronulla, Curl Curl, Kirribilli, Kogarah Bay, Lilli Pilli and Millers Point.

Other Sydney suburbs include Bellevue Hill, Darlington Point, Ebenezer, Kenthurst, Tamarama, Willoughby East and Wollstonecraft.

For those wanting to escape the big smoke, there are plenty of places including Berrigan, Boambee, Chittaway Point, Dunbogan, Macmasters Beach, Nords Wharf, North Haven and as far as Tenterfield in the state's far north.

Rent prices on homes in Portsea on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula (pictured) have dipped by a fifth 

In Victoria, Kooyong, North Geelong, Seaholme, Sorrento lead the way for unit price  reductions.

For homes, try Portsea or Warburton on Melbourne's outskirts or Cape Paterson and Somers further south-east.

In Queensland, Craiglie in the far north and the Brisbane suburb of Masnfield along with Kin Kora and Shoal Point in central are the best bet for slashed rents on units.

The coastal town of Campwin Beach near Mackay and Chandler on Brisbane's outskirts are the best places to score a leased bargain on a home.

In Western Australia, the Perth suburb of Wembley Downs is the best place for apartment bargain hunters while the beachside suburb of Watermans Bay and Kununurra in the state's far north have seen the best rent reductions on homes.

In South Australia, the Adelaide suburbs of Hazelwood Park, Malvern, Stepney have recorded a 20 per cent drop on house rents as has Alice Springs suburb of Desert Springs in the Northern Territory.

House rents have seen a dramatic reduction in Campwin Beach in Central Queensland 

In Tasmania, the best bargains are on rental apartments in Burnie, East Devonport, Hobart, Longford, Romaine, Taroona, Youngtown, Zeehan, which have all seen a minimum 10 per cent drop.

In the national capital, the best suburbs are Weston for units or Hackett, Hawker, Isaacs and Wright if you're looking to lease a home at the fraction of the price. 

Finder analyst Graham Cooke warned landlords in the listed areas may still struggle to find tenants.

'There a lot of people moving towns and universities or switching to online learning, along with Airbnb stock hitting the market so there's increased supply,' he told Sunrise on Sunday.

'The increased demand is nightmare if you're trying to sell something. I myself have moved out of a rental property recently and seen the price drop repeatedly and they still haven't rented it out.

In Western Australia, the Perth suburb of Watermans Bay (pictured) also make the list

If you live in or seeking to move to above areas, Mr Cooke has some advice on how to go about asking for a rent drop.

Tenants who always pay their rent on time and have a good credit score will be better placed to see a rent reduction.

He also advises tenants to do their homework by looking at rents of similar properties similar in the area and to be polite but firm when asking for a drop.

'Most landlords are small-scale property owners who will also be paying mortgages. Be gentle but firm with your case, especially if you want to maintain a strong relationship with your landlord in the future,' Mr Cooke said.

Now is the time to snap up a rental bargain in Sydney with a 10 per cent reduction on homes for rent in the harbourside suburb of Darling Point (pictured)
