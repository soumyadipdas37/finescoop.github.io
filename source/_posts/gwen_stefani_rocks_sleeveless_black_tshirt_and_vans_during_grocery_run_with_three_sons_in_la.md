Gwen Stefani recently revealed that her quarantine with boyfriend Blake Shelton and her three sons was 'magical.'

But the three-time Grammy winner has been managing to steal away with the kids for some quality family outings.

She stayed true to her punk roots Sunday in a sleeveless black t-shirt and Vans, during a grocery run with Kingston, Zuma and Apollo in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The 50-year-old's shirt was printed with 'be cool, be nice,' showing off a black lace bra underneath, and paired with some distressed jeans, adorned with floral designs at the bottom.

She finished the look with a jeweled black face mask, gold bling necklaces, matching bangles and the black and white checkered slip-on kicks.

Stefani held hands with Apollo, six, as Zuma, 12, and Kingston, 14, helped her load the car with pumpkins and flowers.

She shares her three sons with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, 54, to whom she was married from 2002 to 2016.

The Hollaback Girl artist recently threw shade at her ex, when she photoshopped an old photo of boyfriend Blake Shelton, 44, over Rossdale in a throwback of the former couple. 

She previously posted the original photo back in 2014, celebrating her 12th wedding anniversary with the Bush frontman. 

Stefani and Shelton performed their duet Happy Anywhere at the Academy of Country Music Awards this month, their first performance together at the awards show.

They sang in front of a green screen, which placed them at the Bluebird Cafe, one of three locations in Nashville where celebs made appearances for the event.

Meanwhile, their collab Nobody But You recently earned Stefani her first CMT Music Award nomination, as they're up for Collaborative Video of the Year. 

She's preparing to join Shelton, as she makes her return next month for season 19 of The Voice, where the first met on the judges panel back in 2014, before they began dating in November of 2019. 

The No Doubt frontwoman recently said of their quarantine in a promo video: 'It's been pretty magical for Blake and I and the kids because we don't ever have that much solid time together. We did do a lot of fun stuff. We did a lot of cooking.'

It comes after a source told Us Weekly something to the contrary: 'They feel suffocated and stressed. They’re both stretched to the limit.'

The couple previously made a huge investment in their future, dropping $13.2million on a mansion in Encino, in an off-market deal. 

The insider continued: 'Friends say this move has turned into a nightmare. This is the toughest period they’ve had so far without a doubt.'  

'They know how to compromise,' they said, adding that Stefani and Shelton have always found a way to 'work through any tension and look at the bigger picture.'
