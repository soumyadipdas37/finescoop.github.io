They delighted fans on Wednesday by announcing their sixth studio album Confetti will be released in November. 

And Little Mix's Perrie Edwards looked sensational as she put on a busty display and went braless in double denim after appearing on The One Show on Thursday. 

The singer, 27, was joined by her stylish bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock, 28, who exuded glamour in an oversized shirt and wide-leg trousers.

Perrie flaunted her curves in the denim ensemble, wearing her top buttons open to accentuate her assets.

The blonde beauty added a splash of colour to her look with a red tartan material showing at her ankles from where her jeans had been turned up.

Not forgetting to accessorise, Perrie donned a selection of stylish earrings and let her long locks cascade over her shoulders as she smiled at fans. 

Leigh-Anne was also looking fantastic as she left the TV studios in an oversized shirt which she wore off one shoulder.

She paired the statement piece with some brown trousers that appeared to have a corset-style waist band attached.

The star singer completed her chic look by slicked her locks back into a plait and adding a touch of nude lipstick to accentuate her pretty features. 

Only half of Little Mix were seen after the One Show appearance, with bandmates Jesy Nelson and Jade Thirwall video calling in from their homes. 

The singers' appearances come as it was revealed that Little Mix will be going on an arena tour to promote their new album next year.
