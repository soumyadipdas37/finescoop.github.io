Adam Woodyatt has credited fellow EastEnders star Jake Wood for helping him in his weight loss journey.

The actor, 52, took to Instagram on Monday while enjoying a bike ride, and said it was the Max Branning star, 48, who prompted him to improve his fitness by exercising regularly and 'get out there.'

Sharing a message of appreciation to Jake while riding his bike, Adam said: 'Like my mate Mr Wood says, "you got to get out there. You got to do it." He goes running and I go cycling.'

Adam has often kept his fans up to date with his physical fitness since taking up cycling on a regular basis in the countryside.

The actor even enjoyed a bike ride with Jake last month, and the pair posed for a snap together during the outing in the woods with Jake's son.

While earlier this month, Adam shared a selfie from one of his lunchtime bike rides before enjoying a steak sandwich by the river.

It comes after Adam admitted to being fat-shamed by EastEnders fans who saw him in person. 

Recalling one particularly hurtful experience, he told The Sun: 'One of the best examples of somebody being rude is when we were at the BBC Good Food show.

'This woman looks at me and says, "You’re fatter than you are on telly."' 

Adam recently split from his wife Beverley Sharp after 22 years of marriage.

The couple separated in August of last year but it is thought that they have only now started telling friends about their decision.

A friend told The Sun that Beverley was 'very upset' at the split but added that it's a 'straightforward separation'.

They said: 'Nobody plans for these things and divorce is a difficult thing to get your head around but they have dealt with it quietly for several months and are now telling friends so it's less of a secret.

'They still get on well, and are keen to make sure they stay that way for the sake of their children – even though they are now grown up.' 

Adam and Beverley have been married since 1998 and have two children - Jessica, 27, and Samuel, 23.

A spokesperson for the actor said: 'Beverley and Adam separated in August last year and we ask that the family's privacy is respected.'
