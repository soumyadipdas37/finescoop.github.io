Three construction workers were given a first hand glimpse of Sydney's new Crown Casino on Tuesday - but not by choice.

Footage uploaded to Reddit showed a trio of workers in a cage suspended by a massive crane bump into James Packer's soon to be completed gambling venue with some degree of force. 

Eventually the men made their way down to safety in what looked to be a terrifying experience.

A Reddit user (pictured above) said the experience would have evoked a 'big nope from me' while another said it was an example of 'appalling health and safety'

One Reddit user sympathised with the workers, stating 'that would be a big nope from me' while another pointed to 'appalling health and safety measures.'

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Crown Casino Sydney and construction company Lendlease for comment. 

It isn't the first incident of its kind at the soon to be second casino in the harbour city. 

In January this year, an unattended crane repeatedly smashed into the $2.4billion casino in Barangaroo as intense winds smashed the city.

The crane repeatedly collided with a single window pane in the high rise building, which will become a casino and luxury apartment block upon completion in December. 

A spokeswoman for Crown Resorts confirmed one of the window panes was shattered in the incident.

'The site was closed at the time, and nobody was injured,' she said at the time.

'A full safety review of the crane equipment is being conducted. Crown is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors and visitors.'
