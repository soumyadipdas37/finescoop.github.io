The show has returned to Universal Studios Hollywood with in-studio guests and an in-studio virtual audience after five months of shows produced virtually from Kelly’s ranch in Montana and her home in Los Angeles.  

Star-studded surprises and new signature show segments including #BackToBusiness, #BeTheDifference and #PandemicPivot will make their debut throughout the month.

'The last time I was on this stage it was over six months ago,' she said in a press release.

'A lot has changed. The pandemic has tested us all, but from day one I said this show would be about connection- and not even 2020 is going to change that. 

'I am so happy to be back at our home studio at Universal with my band, our crew and our new virtual house seats filled with people from all over the country. Music has always been my outlet to help me through difficult times, so our season 2 premiere week is dedicated to honoring the incredible power of music and the way it heals us and brings us together.'

She then said that will continue to have important conversations with changemakers. 

'We will continue to elevate underserved voices. We will continue to shine the spotlight on inspiring stories. It will be a season of uplifting and unforgettable moments that I can’t wait to experience with you.'
