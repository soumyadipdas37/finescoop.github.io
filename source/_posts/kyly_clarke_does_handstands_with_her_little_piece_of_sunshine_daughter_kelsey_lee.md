She's the stunning former WAG known for her super fit physique.

And on Thursday, Kyly Clarke proudly showed off her impressive upper body strength as she shared footage doing handstands with her daughter Kelsey Lee.

In the video, Kyly, 39, and her four-year-old daughter were both seen doing handstands as they spent quality time together in Sydney.

'Gymnastics practice!' Kyly Clarke proudly showed off her impressive upper body strength as she shared footage doing handstands with her daughter Kelsey Lee on Thursday

'Gymnastics practice with my little piece of sunshine ☀️,' she wrote alongside the hashtag #kelseyleeclarke.

She completed the caption, writing: 'Loving this weather and all things outdoors.'

The post comes just days after the mother-of-one flaunted her slim figure as she posed at the gym after completing a workout.

The stunning brunette styled her long locks in a high ponytail and went makeup free for the session.

Kyly's post comes after her ex-husband Michael Clarke reflected on his life, a year after separating from his wife of seven years. 

In a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, the 39-year-old retired Australian cricketer said that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.

'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.

Michael, who co-parents four-year-old daughter Kelsey Lee with Kyly, went on to reveal that he has been able to maintain a 'wonderful' friendship with his ex-wife.

In July, Michael confirmed his relationship with P.E Nation co-founder Pip Edwards, when they were spotted enjoying a romantic vacation in Noosa, Queensland. 

Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, 40, the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.
