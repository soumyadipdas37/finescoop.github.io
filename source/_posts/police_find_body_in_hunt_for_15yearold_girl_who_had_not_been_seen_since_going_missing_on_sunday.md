Police searching for a 15-year-old girl who had not been seen since Sunday say they have found a body. 

Seesha Dack vanished while out seeing friends at Fish Quay, in North Shields, North Tyneside, on Sunday evening.

Police launched a search for the missing teenager and were seen scouring a disused warehouse near to where she went missing.

Seesha's mother Victoria Dack, 33, had launched a desperate appeal to get her 'baby girl home safe'. 

Northumbria Police revealed this evening that a body of a female was found near Tanners Bank in North Shields. 

Seesha Dack was last sighted at the Fish Quay, in North Shields, North Tyneside, on Sunday evening. On Tuesday evening they announced a body had been discovered near Tanners Bank in North Shields

Officers believe it is Seesha's body, but formal identification is still due to take place.  

Superintendent Barrie Joisce, of Northumbria Police, said: 'This is an extremely sad conclusion to an extensive investigation.

'Specialist officers are currently supporting Seesha’s family during this incredibly difficult time and our thoughts are with them.

'I want to thank everyone who helped in our search by sharing our appeals, searching the area and those who have phoned us with possible sightings.

'We will continue to carry out enquiries to establish the circumstances around the death but at this stage we do not believe there to be any third party involvement.”

Once formal identification has been completed a report will be prepared for the coroner.
