Nikki's plan had been to get induced exactly a week ahead of her August 6 due date as her blood pressure had the doctors concerned, but her water broke at the doctor's office on July 30. 

'We barely had bags packed. I labored for 22 hours, and I pushed for two hours while wearing a mask because of COVID-19. It was 118 degrees in Phoenix, and our room wouldn't get colder than 76 degrees, so I was burning hot the whole time.'
