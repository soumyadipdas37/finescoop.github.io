Shakira certainly knows how to get your attention. 

The 43-year-old Colombian singer looked absolutely stunning on Monday, as she posted a racy snap to her 68 million Instagram followers.

'This is a new bathing suit I designed and my friend Bego made for me,' the Hips Don't Lie singer captioned the post, adding: 'I always need to create my own for the summer!'

The lilac two-piece showcased the She Wolf singer's killer curves, and featured string bikini bottoms which she was sure to show off in the picture. 

Shakira shares two children with her husband, footballer Gerard Piqué, who she has been married to since 2011. 

The happy couple share two sons, Milan, seven, and Sasha, five.

In February this year, Shakira reminded the world what a true superstar she is, as she joined Jennifer Lopez to perform at the halftime of the National Football League's Super Bowl LIV, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

Shakira put on a showstopping and high-energy performance, racing through her hits including Whenever, Wherever, Waka Waka, and She Wolf. 

Her trainer Anna Kaiser, whose danced-based cardio fitness AKT method combines toning and strength circuits, explained to Vogue how the star managed to pull off the intense routine on stage.

'Shakira is really focused on consistency with her workouts—the strength, the cardio, the stamina, the power, the flexibility, everything,' the trainer explained. 

The pair had been starting their day ahead of the performance with a 90-minute dance interval workout, and it appears that Shakira - who has belly danced since she was a child - is still looking in better shape than ever.

'She will make some of the movements her own, adding flair with her hips,' Anna revealed. 'Even though it's super intense, she's still having fun!'
