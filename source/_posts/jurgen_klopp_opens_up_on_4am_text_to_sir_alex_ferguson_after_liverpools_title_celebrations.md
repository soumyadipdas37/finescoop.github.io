Jurgen Klopp has opened up on his mischievous 4am text message he sent to Sir Alex Ferguson on the night Liverpool were crowned champions of England once again.

Klopp contacted the former Manchester United manager in the small hours, waking the Scotsman from his sleep.

Now, on the eve of the Premier League's return, Klopp has revealed what really happened and how himself and the legendary former manager came into contact.

'I didn't call him, I have to clarify that. I sent him a message,' a smiling Klopp told reporters at his pre-match press conference ahead of Liverpool hosting Leeds United.

'The problem was that I came back late in my room that night obviously and I couldn't sleep immediately, so I went back through the messages I got and one of them was from Alex Ferguson.

'And so I just reply in a very polite way I think. I think it was 3.30, four o'clock round about.'

Klopp revealed he was simply caught up in the moment and wanted to get back to all those who had wished him well, but did not consider that the 78-year-old Ferguson would have his phone set on loud.

'I didn't expect him having the phone by his bed actually, I didn't want to wake him up but if that happened, sorry Alex!,' Klopp added.

'Since then we were not in contact, he's still the former Man United manager I don't think he wants to talk to me too much about the success of Liverpool. 

'He respects it but it's not his favourite thing to watch on television.'

Klopp goes up against Marcelo Bielsa on Saturday at Anfield, as Liverpool begin their title defence with a late kick-off against the newly promoted victors of the Championship.

Earlier this week Klopp spoke of his admiration for Bielsa and his eagerness to speak with the Argentine, though joked that the language barrier may be an issue.

'My Spanish is pretty random, I'd love to have a conversation with him which would be nice, but I don't speak Spanish apart from ordering a beer and I don't know how his English is meanwhile,' said the Liverpool boss.

'So that's a bit of a shame, but apart from that I just couldn't have more respect for what he is doing to be honest.

'What a guy. The team, the style, how they play will suit them even more for the Premier League than for the Championship one hundred percent.'
