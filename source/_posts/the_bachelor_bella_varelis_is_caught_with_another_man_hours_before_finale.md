Embarrassing photos have surfaced just hours before The Bachelor finale of contestant Bella Varelis in a compromising position with another man.

Locky Gilbert will choose between marketing consultant Bella, 25, and recovery nurse Irena Srbinovska, 31, during Thursday's nerve-wracking last episode.

But paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro over the weekend.

One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.

The vehicle was just across the street from Bella's Mini.

The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away. 

Bella stepped out an hour later, shortly before 11am, with her flatmate Bec Cvilikas, who was eliminated from The Bachelor on Wednesday night.

While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.

No Bachelor winner would be this indiscreet in the lead-up to the season finale, so it can be safely assumed she isn't dating the 31-year-old Survivor star.

Bella had previously been spotted getting flirty with artist Nathan, 25, at the beach in Point Piper, Sydney, last Monday.

She told Daily Mail Australia at the time they were just friends and had been 'for years'.

'It's purely platonic,' she added. 'I've been pretty hurt by the online hate I've been getting and he's been one of the many friends who has been there for me recently.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment on the latest photos.

While Nathan has not commented on their rumoured relationship, he did defend Bella earlier this month after she was targeted by trolls.

Speaking to gossip website The Wash recently, he said that his friend's portrayal on The Bachelor as a needy and territorial 'villain' was unfair.

'Bella is under contract so she can't say anything publicly. But I have been her mate for years and I know that what you are seeing on TV is not what would have happened,' he said.

'I have had a bad edit myself [on The Bachelorette] and I feel awful for her. Bella is such a sweetheart... She has been stitched up.

'She is upset by the sudden turn. I was there for her when this all happened [after filming] and now as it's playing out on TV.

'Just remember she is a real person with real feelings and be kind.'

Fans of The Bachelor franchise will remember party boy Nathan from Ali Oetjen's season of The Bachelorette in 2018.

He was infamously kicked off the show after Ali, 34, accused him of spreading rumours in the mansion about her sexual history.

He later denied starting gossip, telling Now To Love: 'We were all sitting around the pool and the topic of the rumours was brought up.

'A few of the boys had said what they had heard and I basically just said what I had heard.'

According to Sportsbet, Irena Srbinovska is the favourite to win The Bachelor with odds of $1.50 as of Thursday morning.

By contrast, Bella has longer odds of $2.40.
