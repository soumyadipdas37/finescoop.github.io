He captioned the comical photo: 'Lesson one: When dad bottle feeding express milk for the first time don't get over excited and feed her too much'.

'At the end of our summer holidays, I walked into the most beautiful surprise - a room filled with the most incredible flowers and Lachy singing at his piano and then asking me to marry him. It was such a surprise and so special. Our faces say it all,' she wrote next to a selfie of the couple. 

'It was something very meaningful for us to both have the opportunity to propose to one another, each in our own way,' she continued.
