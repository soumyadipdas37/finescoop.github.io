Tammy Hembrow knows how to steal the limelight. 

And the 26-year-old blonde bombshell certainly turned plenty of heads during the opening of boyfriend Matt Poole's new restaurant, Maman Bar and Kitchen.

Tammy proved to be quite the scene-stealer as she gave a glimpse of her ample assets in a racy black dress with raunchy cut outs. 

Racy: Tammy Hembrow, 26, (R) set pulses racing as she flaunted plenty of underboob in a black dress alongside boyfriend Matt Poole at the opening of his Gold Coast restaurant 

The dress also flashed her toned midriff and navel, through a circular cut out around her stomach. 

Tammy paired her eye-catching dress with a pair of pointed heels and a black handbag which she wore slung over her shoulders. 

The Gold Coast beauty opted to wear her long, blonde tresses back in a ponytail. 

Romantic: Matt held Tammy in close at the opening of his new restaurant Maman bar and kitchen, located in the Gold Coast's trendy Burleigh Heads

She finished her look with a glossy foundation, dark eye makeup, and a matte lipstick. 

Matt showed off his equally impressive physique in a black shirt which he paired with matching black pants and white sneakers. 

The athlete spoke about the new venture to the Courier Mail on Thursday: 'I'm coming towards the back end of my (ironman) career now,' he said.

'I'm 32 and been racing professionally for 14 years – so I'm starting to look to transition into life after sport,' he added. 

Matt admitted he is unlikely to be in the kitchen, with him looking to be 'at the front door' or 'behind the bar'. 

The couple's display comes after Matt made his debut on Tammy's YouTube channel last month and answered a series of questions from her fans.

The genetically blessed couple revealed who was the 'most dominant' in their relationship, and also who'd been the first to say 'I love you'.

'I think you're the dominant one,' Matt said. 'I go along and I go along, and then when you push me too far, I snap, and you go, "Oh, too far."'

'Yeah, I would agree,' Tammy responded. 'I just think I'm quite a dominant person.'

The pair, who met at an event in Bali last year, also revealed who'd said 'I love you' first.

'I did. I am obsessed,' Matt admitted, before Tammy explained how Matt had confessed his feelings after they'd 'had a little fight' on holiday in the Whitsundays in September. 

'We had a little fight over nothing, and then when he was trying to make up with me and apologise, he told me he loved me,' the fitness mogul said with a smile.
