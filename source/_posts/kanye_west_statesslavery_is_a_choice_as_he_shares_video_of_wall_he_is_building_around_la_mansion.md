Kanye West revealed the giant wall he is constructing around his Los Angeles mansion as he continued his Twitter feud with music label Universal and Sony by claiming 'slavery is a choice'.  

The rapper, 43, shared a short video of the wall, showing off a renovated garden with planters and trees lined up to be put in the earth.

The walls are similar to the ones placed around his Wyoming ranch, where the Grammy-award winner stayed during recent troubles with wife Kim Kardashian. 

He continued the Twitter rant into the night as he also revealed he wanted to start  a Yeezy Christian Academy and that he's still waiting for Drake to call him after asking for an apology the night before.

West repeated his controversial claim that slavery is a choice on Tuesday night 

'It's a good start,' West said as he posted the video featuring a female friend. 

'This is fresh man! Grow your own foods, fruits…' the woman says. 

The white walls appeared to surround two separate buildings in the complex. 

The video came shortly after West posted an image of a mock-up for promotional material for a christian academy that he said would be built on faith, music, collaboration, communication and creativity.

He then returned to his ongoing attempts to contact rappers who he believes should be supporting his quest for a new music contract. 

'In the streaming world master ownership is everything... that is the bulk of the income ... in COVID artist need our masters ... it's more important than ever before I got J Cole number waiting for Kendrick and Drake,' he wrote. 

'Che Pope got Dave Free's number ... will have Kendrick's number shortly ... I'll keep you guys updated. Remember they cut our tongues when we were on the boat ... but noooooow.... slaaaaaavery iiiiiiiiis aaaaaaaaa chooooooooice,' he added, revisiting the controversial statement he first made in during a 'serious episode' with his bipolar disorder in 2018.

'When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years?' told TMZ then. 'That sounds like a choice. We're mentally imprisoned.'

He later apologized for the remarks but appeared to take it back again Tuesday as he continued by asking for 'an army of angels to cover me while I pull this sword out of the stone'. 

'I need everyone's prayers ... I promise we will be free and own our masters but we must be faithful to God this time,' West added. 

'No more killing each other. No more threatening to take each other's girls and wives ... let's show the world how great we truly are. We are God's chosen people.

'It's a good start,' West said as he posted the video featuring a female friend

The video showed another person watering the plants beside the new wall 

West also tweeted about a Yeezy Christian Academy and shared a mock-up image

Later the rapper continued his Twitter feud over his music contract with Universal

The 43-year-old said that he would be 'free and own our masters' 

'The artist deserve to own our masters ... artist are starving without tours ... Ima go get our masters ... for all artist ... pray for me.

'I don't wanna see no woke tweets or hear no woke raps ... it's show time ... it's a whole different energy right now.'

Earlier on Tuesday, West shared a text conversation on Twitter about possibly taking legal action against Universal and Sony just hours after he announced that he would not make any more music until his contract ends. 

'I'm not putting no more music out till I'm done with my contract with Sony and Universal ... On God ... in Jesus name ... come and get me,' West tweeted Monday night. 

Kanye West on Tuesday shared a text conversation about possibly taking legal action against Universal and Sony

'I need to see everybody's contracts at Universal and Sony I'm not gonna watch my people be enslaved I'm putting my life on the line for my people The music industry and the NBA are modern day slave ships I'm the new Moses,' West added. 

Apparently neither of the companies had responded to West's tweets, which prompted him to share the text conversation between himself and someone who appears to be a lawyer. 

'No one from Universal or Sony has responded so it's Go time,' West wrote Tuesday morning. 

In the actual text conversation, the individual who could be a lawyer writes: 'Meaning that we can argue that Universal and Sony have not supported you fully. And that as a result they have breached. This is the lawsuit/termination nuclear option.'

The individual continues: 'If we went that route we would litigate and ask for your masters as part of a settlement. This is a high risk but high reward strategy.'

At some point, West and the individual spoke about Taylor Swift and the controversial $300million deal that Scooter Braun, who manages Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, struck in order to obtain her master recordings in 2019. 

'Re masters ownership we can look into buying. But if Taylor's [Swift] cost $300million yours would cost a lot more I assume. Remember that if you re-recorded these songs you could own these new masters outright,' the person speaking with West wrote. 

'A much more radical consideration would be to propose an entirely new relationship or joint venture with Universal. One that is equal and not one sided. I am not sure you are interested in that. But if [sic] could be a Yeezy Media/Universal joint venture play but one where you have the power,' the person continued. 

'I'm not putting no more music out till I'm done with my contract with Sony and Universal ... On God ... in Jesus name ... come and get me,' Kanye West tweeted Monday night

Just hours after tweeting about not making any more music under Universal and Sony, the rapper shared a text conversation between himself and someone who appears to be a lawyer. The two discussed possible litigation against Universal and Sony as a 'nuclear option'

West later tweeted Tuesday that he was 'making progress' with the situation

In response to those text messages, West responded: 'I'm not open to any form of business with Universal or Sony.'

West later tweeted that he was making progress with the situation. 

'Hey everyone we're making progress... I'll keep everyone updated on how this meeting with Vivendi goes... If Nikola Tesla had a Twitter the world would run off AC ... Edison killed Tesla's image to control the power LITERALLY... Tesla and I only mean well for the world,' West tweeted. 

The rapper shared that tweet with a screen shot of a text message that reads: 'Katie reached out off of the tweet. She is on the board of Vivendi.

The Vivendi family are the French conglomerate that owns Universal music that includes West's GOOD label, Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam on which his music was released.

Tuesday's public conversation was a continuation of one that West started on Monday. 

'Vivendi family I'm in Calabassas,' he shared Monday night.  

'I need a [public] apology from J Cole and Drake to start with immediately,' he then wrote in another tweet, adding, 'I'm Nat Turner … I'm fighting for us.'

West was referring to his past feuds with J. Cole and Drake in the past.

Nat Turner is an American slave who led a Virginia rebellion for freedom in 1831. 

West demanded an apology with artists J Cole and Drake with whom he has feuded in the past. He stated that he was 'Nat Turner', an American slave who led a Virginia rebellion in 1831

Forbes calculates Kanye West's net worth to be at $1.3billion. This tweet was later deleted

 



As the Twitter rant continued, West wrote: 'I'm the 2nd richest black man in America,' followed by 'I need all my people with me for us to get free,' however that tweet was later deleted. 

'I deleted that tweet about riches... the wealth is in our love of family and our brothers and our service to God ... let's rise up... let's communicate,' West explained.

'Let's stop killing each other ... let's show God that we are Gods people ... my ego gets the best of me too... God doesn't measure us by money in his kingdom ... let's love each other... I love my brothers and I miss my friends ... real talk,' West continued. 

'I'm waiting to meet with [Shawn] Carter also,' West then tweeted, referring to Jay-Z.

'I'm not industry bro ... I don't care... I'm in service to Christ ... we need world healing ... I miss my brothers... I refuse to argue with black men on labels we don't own... even twitter', West said in another jumbled tweet.

West then went on to discuss other concerns and pleaded for unity among his peers.

'No more dissing each other on labels we don't own,' he requested.  

West ended up suing Sony/ATV-owned EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music Group, Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam in January 2019 as he tried to get out of his contract.

The suit was ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount in October. 

West then went on to share a screenshot of a post from Instagram account @balleralert, featuring a conversation between NBA star Kevin Durant and businessman Steve Stoute in which they discourage Black Americans from voting for the rapper in this year's general election. 

'Steve Stoute is a good man ... this is my brother ... I'm disappointed with a lot of his recent decisions but Steve is my brother... I understand bro,and I'm here for life,' West tweeted. 

On Friday, West was told that he does not qualify to be on the presidential ballot in battleground state of Wisconsin after missing a filing deadline as shocked fans also learned that the long-running KUWTK series will come to an end after 20 seasons.
