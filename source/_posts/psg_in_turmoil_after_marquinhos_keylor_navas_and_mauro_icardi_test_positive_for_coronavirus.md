It was revealed on Wednesday that Neymar was among three other stars to also test positive

PSG wrote in a statement on Twitter: 'The latest SarsCoV2 PCR tests carried out within the Paris Saint-Germain squad confirm the result of three new positive cases.

'These players will follow the appropriate health protocol.'

Neymar is reportedly among the small group out of action as a result of contracting the disease. 

The French champions revealed the initial extent of positive results on Wednesday, but did not confirm identities, and L'Equipe reported that Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes were the other unfortunate stars.

PSG are yet to begin their title defence after reaching the Champions League final this month

Ligue 1 began again on August 21 after a lengthy hiatus, but PSG are yet to kickstart their title defence after reaching the Champions League final last month.

Marseille and Saint-Etienne were originally scheduled to clash on the opening day, but the fixture was postponed after four players for the home team tested positive. 

It was initially planned that PSG would take on Lens in their top-flight opener just six days after suffering defeat to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. That game will now take place after the international break, however.

The COVID-19 pandemic saw Ligue 1 scrapped last campaign with PSG, who had been 12 points clear at the top of the table, crowned once again in March.
