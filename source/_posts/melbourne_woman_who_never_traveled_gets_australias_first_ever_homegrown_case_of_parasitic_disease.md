A horrific parasitic disease once confined to developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America has surfaced in a Melbourne woman who has never been overseas.

The 25-year-old was found to have cysts on her brain after suffering migraines with 'visual aura' and blurred vision for six straight days.   

She was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, a serious disease that causes symptoms including seizures, headaches, blindness, meningitis and dementia - and had to have brain surgery to remove a lesion.

The disease is spread by ingesting pork tapeworm eggs found in human feces when someone doesn't wash their hands properly after the toilet and prepares food.  Humans get the pork tapeworm itself by eating undercooked pork from pigs that ate infected human feces

The medical community is mystified as to how she got the disease, which is usually confined to countries with poor sanitation and free-ranging pigs that have access to eating vegetation contaminated by human faeces. 

The woman lived with her parents and siblings in an outer suburb of Melbourne and worked as a barista. 

A case report on the Melbourne woman has been published by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene to put physicians on high alert for the possibility of infections in places like Australia where they least expect them.

Cysticercosis has previously been found in Australia only in immigrants or travellers recently returned from endemic areas.

'This is the first recorded autochthonous (homegrown) case of NCC (neurocysticercosis) in Australia,' the report says. 

The horror disease is common in undeveloped countries with poor sanitation and hygiene across Africa, Asia and Latin America - but in a shock to lovers of bacon and ham, Australia's first home-grown case of mystery origin has just been found

The disease is caused by a parasitic tapeworm found only in pigs and humans called taenia solium.  

The life-cycle of the parasite depends on humans passing the eggs in their faeces, which are then ingested by the pig.

The pig develops parasitic cysts called cysticerci that lodge in its muscles. 

When humans eat undercooked pork from the pig, they ingest the cysticerci which result in adult tapeworms attaching to their intestines - and they can stay there for many years.

This does not cause the disease however.

The disease is caused when people excrete the tapeworm eggs in their faeces, and get some on their hands and don't wash them properly.

Then they either put their hands in their mouths, infecting themselves, or prepare food for others, spreading the eggs.

Cysticercosis is caused when humans ingest the eggs of the tapeworm. 

The eggs hatch into tiny larvae that travel around the body in the blood and can lodge themselves in the heart, the central nervous system and the brain where they cause cysticerci.

Neurocysticercosis is when cysticerci grow in the brain.   

'These larval cysts ... are a major cause of adult onset seizures in most low-income countries,' the US CDC says on its website. 

The case has sparked warnings that increasing international travel is spreading diseases such as neurocysticercosis to Australia.

According to the Melbourne woman's case report, she had suffered from regular migraines for seven years - since she was 18 years old.

She would get a visual aura and migraine two or three times per month, which doctors dismissed with pain medication such as paracetamol or metoclopramide for migraines.

At age 25 when her headache lasted six days straight, however, doctors sent the woman for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which found a lesion.

When they operated on her and removed the lesion they found pork tapeworm larvae in a cysticerci.    

After DNA testing, they determined the Melbourne woman's infection was linked to a strain common in Asia.

While less than 10 per cent of residents in the woman's suburb were born in Asia and less than 6 per cent in India, her work as a barista put her in contact with a wide range of people who were from or travelled to endemic areas.

'It is not surprising that with the high frequency and ease of travel between endemic and non-endemic regions, sporadic infection can occur in people, who would otherwise be considered at no or very low risk of infection,' the case report said.

Cysticercosis is caused by larval cysts that infect the brain, muscle or other tissue, and is a major cause of seizures in developing countries 

1) A person gets cysticercosis by swallowing pork tapeworm eggs found in the feces of a person who has the intestinal tapeworm

2) This can happen if the person with the tapeworm does not wash their hands properly after going to the bathroom and spreads the eggs to themselves or others for example in food preparation

3) The eggs hatch into tiny larvae that travel to the central nervous system, brain, muscles or the eye, where they develop into parasitic cysts called cysticerci

4) People do NOT get cysticercosis by eating undercooked pork, only from eating the eggs

HOW THE PORK TAPEWORM IS SPREAD 



1) A person with the pork tapeworm taenia solium in their intestines passes eggs in their feces, contaminating vegitation

2) Pigs eat the vegetation and ingest the eggs

3) Inside the pig's intestine the eggs hatch and the larvae break through the intestinal wall. The blood circulation carries them to the muscles of the pig where they embed and make cysticerci. They can persist for years. 

4) A person eats undercooked or raw pork from the pig, ingesting the cysticerci.

5) The cystercerci migrate to the small intestine of the person and develop into their adult tapeworm form within two months. They attach to the intestinal wall with hook-like jaws and can persist for long periods of time. 

6) They do not cause cysticerci in the intestines but when the person passes feces it is contaminated with the eggs
