Alessandra Ambrosio has been known to show off her competitive side and supermodel figure during a game of beach volleyball.

And on Sunday the Brazilian beauty, 39, was back at it again when she took to the sands of Santa Monica, where she hooked up with a bunch of pals just feet away from the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean.

Her Sunday funday also included some time frolicking in the water, lounging on a towel as she checked her phone messages, a brief stop at a store to pick up some birthday party supplies, and a morning yoga session.

After working up a sweat playing volleyball, Ambrosio took some time to relax on the sand and check her phone messages as she sipped on a drink. 

Moments later, she pulled her long brown tresses into a bun and then headed into the ocean to cool off.  

She was all smiles as she slowly made her way into the chilly water. At times, when the waves got a little more intense, she appeared to be apprehensive and headed back towards the shoreline.

But in the end, she mustered up the confidence walked back into the water for some swim time.
