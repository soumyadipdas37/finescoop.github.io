Aston Villa have completed the signing of Chelsea midfielder Ross Barkley on a season-long-loan deal this morning. 

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard spoke this week about cutting the depth of his squad and following the signings of Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech in midfield this summer, the Blues boss has decided to let 26-year-old Barkley leave the club. 

Villa manager Dean Smith said: 'Capturing a player of Ross's quality is a real coup for our Club and I am certain he will thrive here and improve our team.'
