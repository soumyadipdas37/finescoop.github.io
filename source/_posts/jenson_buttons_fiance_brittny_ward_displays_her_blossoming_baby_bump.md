The Instagram sensation and her former formula one beau, 40, announced they're expecting their second child together earlier this summer.

The couple revealed they're set to welcome a baby girl later this year with a snap of Brittny cradling her blossoming bump.

The news came just weeks after Jenson and Brittny were forced to postpone their wedding for the second time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, having pushed it back once after unexpectedly falling pregnant with their first child.

In May, Brittney took to Instagram to reveal their wedding will now take place in the summer of 2021. 

Sharing a picture of herself with her love, she wrote: 'I cannot wait to marry this guy... finally!

'First an unexpected but such a blessing baby button and then corona virus 2021 I’ll become Mrs. Button officially.'

The couple had first been due to tie the knot on July 6, 2019 but Brittny fell pregnant.

She wrote on Instagram: 'Today would have been our wedding date in Italy, but in a few weeks we will be mummy and daddy.'

Their son, Hendrix, arrived in July last year via a planned C-section, and Brittney announced the news with a sweet Instagram post.

Sharing a cute photograph of their baby boy's feet, Brittny penned: 'He's here, he's healthy and our hearts couldn't be more full'. 

Happy: Brittny and Jenson got engaged in June 2018 after two years of dating. Their second wedding was thought to be taking place on July 10, 2020, in Lake Como

Their second planned wedding was thought to be taking place on July 10, 2020, in Lake Como. 

Brittny and Jenson got engaged in June 2018 after two years of dating. 

During a candid interview with HELLO! magazine, the Playboy model later described how Jenson was overcome with emotion when he found out he was set to become a father. 

She said: 'Jenson was away when I found out, and I wanted to tell him face-to face so I waited until he returned home.

'It was so hard to not say anything on the phone but I thought it was more special to do it in person. I gave him a little gift box with the test in it and he started crying.

'It was a very sweet moment. It was exactly what you would want the father of your future child to do.' 

Jenson was previously engaged to model Louise Griffiths, 40, before the couple split in 2005 after five years of dating.

The sporting legend was also married to model Jessica Michibata, but split in December 2015 after one year of marriage and a seven year romance.
