Derby County are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Fiorentina for former Liverpool youngster Bobby Duncan.

The 19-year-old, who is the cousin of Reds legend Steven Gerrard, left Anfield in acrimonious circumstances last summer.

Duncan's former agent, Saif Rubie, claimed that Liverpool were damaging Duncan's mental health by not allowing him to move to Italy. 

Derby County are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Fiorentina for Bobby Duncan

Duncan joined Fiorentina in a controversial transfer from Liverpool just over a year ago

Duncan's exit was soured by a dispute between his ex-agent Saif Rubie and Liverpool

Liverpool eventually sanctioned the move, with Duncan leaving the club in a £1.8 million deal plus add ons and signing a three-year deal with the Viola.

But the striker's move to Italy hasn't worked out and Fiorentina look set to allow him to leave just over 12 months after his controversial move.

According to The Telegraph, Duncan has returned to England to hold talks with Derby, with the two clubs close to agreeing a fee.

Duncan was initially part of Man City's academy before being bought by Liverpool in 2018

It is likely the youngster will initially be part of the club's under-23 side but he will be hopeful of breaking into the first team if he scores goals at youth level. 

Derby boss Philip Cocu has overseen a woeful start to the season, which has seen the club lose both of their opening games and score just one goal.

He will hope the arrival of Jordon Ibe, who is joining the club as a free agent, and potentially the arrival of Duncan, will give the club more goal threat in the final third.
