A cruel dog owner was caught brutally punching his cocker spaniel after losing his temper during a shopping trip.

Gregory Phillips, 40, was filmed violently handling and striking the dog on Pentre Street, Glynneath, Neath, South Wales, on March 31 this year.

Shocked passers-by hoot their car horns and shout at Phillips to stop in the dash-cam footage as he attacked the dog outside a local convenience store.

Phillips was given a 12-month community order and told to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Monday.

In the video, the cocker spaniel jumps out of Phillips's car as he loads a crate of beer onto the back seat.

Phillips angrily hoists the dog off the ground and punches it several times before throwing it into the boot of the car alongside other dogs.

He continues to strike the dog inside the car as shocked drivers toot their horns to try and stop the violent attack.

Phillips pleaded guilty to the Animal Welfare Act offence and was sentenced on August 24.

He was given a 12-month community order and told to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £300 in costs and a £90 victim surcharge.

RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben said: 'In broad daylight and with people all around, this poor dog was beaten by his owner - who clearly had no regard for his legal responsibilities towards his animal.

'Fortunately, the dash-cam footage helped us to identify this individual and ensure we could take action.

'Clearly, this is no way to treat an animal - and thankfully, the vast majority of people across South Wales and beyond will be shocked by this footage, and the beating this poor cocker spaniel was subjected to.'
