She's been keeping busy updating fans on life amid the coronavirus pandemic on social media.

And Lizzie Cundy ensured she kept the good times rolling on as she headed out for lunch with her friend Joy Desmond at The Arts Club in Mayfair on Tuesday afternoon.

The former WAG, 52, commanded attention as she slipped into a chic outfit for her outing in the English capital.

Flashing her white bra, the media personality was dressed in a white lace blouse, which featured ruffled detailing across its bodice.

Former footballer Jason Cundy's ex-wife amped up the glamour by teaming her top with a leather mini-skirt and heeled thigh-high boots.

Adding a touch of her typically cool style, the reality star accessorised with huge cat-eye shades and carried her belongings in a quilted handbag.

Earlier this month, Lizzie stepped out for dinner with Lady Kitty Spencer's wealthy Italian ex Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro. 

The businessman has previously been linked to model Elizabeth Hurley after they were spotted having a date together in Mayfair back in 2018.

His white Maserati was also said to be spotted regularly outside her Chelsea home at the time.

The property developer previously dated Princess Diana's niece Lady Kitty, however they called time on their romance in 2017. 

The TV star will no doubt invite Niccolo to the lavish bash she is planning after she was forced to cancel her 52nd birthday during lockdown in May.

In true Lizzie style, she has promised a huge party once life returns to normal with the proceeds from the bash going to the National Health Service.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: 'I really want to give back and say thank you to the NHS as they have been so incredible and I’m so thankful to have got through the coronavirus myself.

'I’m so sad not to be with my family and friends and especially be with my son on my special day but know we will all be together soon...

'Good times are in their way! I want my party to be the biggest fund raiser for the NHS to give thanks!'
