Kim Kardashian is urging her 189 million Instagram followers to save the date of her upcoming launch of the bridal collection of her SKIMS shapewear line.

Just one day after it was reported the reality star is 'considering her options when it comes to her future' with husband Kanye West, she shared a first look at her peculiar collection of bridal lingerie. 

On her Instagram, models could be seen draped in veils, sporting only their undergarments, which range from an eggshell blue thong bodysuit to the brand's signature high-waisted briefs.

Kardashian's collection appeared to be designed with only practicality in mind, as they garments lack any lace, sheer material or cutouts, which are customary on one's wedding day. 

'From something silky to something blue: we’ve got you covered with our most loved Solutionwear styles,' the 39-year-old KKW Beauty mogul announced in an Instagram caption on Wednesday.  

On her Instagram Story, she added: 'Whether you're planning a virtual or socially distant wedding SKIMS has you covered to make you feel your best on your special day.'
