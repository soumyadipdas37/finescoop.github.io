Married At First Sight star Martha Kalifatidis is known for her picture perfect Instagram selfies. 

But the glamorous reality star, 32, suffered a rather unfortunate faux pas on Tuesday when she shared a raunchy Instagram photo of herself modelling a black crop top.  

As Martha posed seductively behind a pair of peach-coloured sunglasses, fans quickly noticed that the camera's flash had made her top see-through.

Apparently unaware of the wardrobe malfunction, the reality star captioned the post: 'Late bae: wakes up on time but lies in bed until she's late.'

The newly-blonde bombshell completed her look with hoop earrings and a baguette-style green handbag. 

It comes after Martha made headlines when she posed for a steamy naked Instagram photo last month.  

Her raciest post yet? Last month, Martha surprised her fans by posting this photo of herself in the mirror immediately after taking a steamy shower 

The beauty blogger flaunted her incredible curves while posing in front of her bathroom mirror after getting out of the shower. 

Martha ensured her ample cleavage was covered by steam, while her newly blonde hair sat soaking wet on her shoulders.

The glamazon shot the mirror a sultry look and wrote in the caption: 'Dat fresh fresh feelin.' 

Loved up! Martha was paired with schoolteacher Michael Brunelli (right) on MAFS last year and the pair have remained together since
