Police have named the man and woman arrested for allegedly snatching a one-year-old boy from his mother at gunpoint in an Atlanta neighborhood.

Married couple Maynor Dario Valera Zuniga and Kristin Nicole Valera Zuniga were detained and booked into the DeKalb County Jail on Saturday.

Both are charged with kidnapping, and Maynor Dario Valera Zuniga also faces charges of aggravated assault and battery.

The couple are believed to be responsible for the abduction of Mateo Alejandro Montufar-Barrera, who was taken in Chamblee around noon earlier Saturday while his mother Leslie Bamaca pushed him in a stroller. 

Police have not yet issued comment on what the couple's alleged motive for the crime was.

In the moments following the abduction, an Amber Alert was issued for the little boy and he was found safe by police about five hours later. 

Police said the pair pulled up to the mom and child in a maroon 2003 Acura MDX before a man exited the car and held a gun at her hip.

When the suspect, described as Hispanic in his mid 20s, attempted to take her son, Bamanca managed to grab his weapon and tried to shoot the man but the gun didn't go off, according to police.

During the struggle, Bamanca also tore off a piece of the suspect's shorts and pulled off one of his shoes.

Photos of the man's clothing were released by the FBI on social media as they asked anyone with information to come forward.

The second suspect, a woman, later exited the car and took the boy. The pair then sped off with baby in their vehicle towards the I-85, authorities said.

The alleged kidnappers were located in Carroll County around 5pm after the Georgia State Patrol spotted the vehicle and pulled them over. 

The suspects were last seen travelling in a Maroon 2003 Acura MDX, license plate RTJ0253, on the I-85.

The two were arrested and taken into custody. Mateo, meanwhile, was found unharmed and was reunited with his mother.

The boy has reportedly been dressed up as a girl by the couple in an attempt to conceal his identity.

Bamanaca is now working with detectives from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation which has taken over the case.

Her sister, Jessica Bamaca told local news station the kidnappers were not known to the family.

'We have no idea who they are. It's the first time we've seen them,' she said. 'We don't know where they came from. We don't know what their intentions were.'

Jessica said her sister fought back bravely as any loving mother would.

‘She fought back with all her strength. She fought back until the last second,’ Jessica said. ‘She put herself in front of that car. She ran behind that car. She did all she could.’
