She debuted her new romance with athlete Matt Poole this week.

And Instagram sensation Tammy Hembrow is pulling out all of the stops to impress him.

The 26-year-old social media star set Instagram alight on Friday when she posted two very revealing photos of herself clad in a tiny g-string bikini as the pair holidayed in the Whitsundays.

Tammy slipped her famous figure into a VERY tiny blue two-piece as she posed on the side of a boat, which she has chartered with Matt and some friends for an idyllic getaway. 

The mother-of-two matched her long blue acrylic nails to her swimsuit and appeared to be makeup free as she cooled off in the water.  

The blonde bombshell told her fans that she was extremely happy in an accompanying caption.  

Tammy debuted her new relationship with Matt this week.

The couple, who previously kept their romance a well-guarded secret, were spotted packing on the PDA at Brisbane Airport on Thursday.

After brief flings with a string of rappers, she cuddled up to the hunky Ironman, 32, as they prepared to jet off to the Whitsundays.

Her ex-fiancé Reece Hawkins's recent baby announcement with London Goheen seemed like the last thing on Tammy's mind as she cosied up to her statuesque new lover.

Triathlete Matt protectively slung his arm over the curvaceous blonde as they strolled together through the bustling terminal.

The Queensland-based pair were travelling en route to Proserpine airport for their Whitsundays trip.

Once they arrived at the idyllic island, Matt shared an Instagram video of Tammy and a group of friends cheering in excitement.

The trip appears to be Tammy and Matt's first holiday as a couple.

The pair have yet to confirm their romance on social media, but influencer Tammy made her first appearance on Matt's Instagram page in a group snap shared at the end of August.

Matt was previously in a relationship with Maddy King - the model ex of Kris Smith.

Tammy's new man Matt is a firm departure from the long list of rappers she has been linked to in previous years.

The bombshell had a brief relationship with American rapper Tyga in early 2019.

Sources told Daily Mail Australia at the time that the Rack City star and Tammy had 'hooked up' at the Rolling Loud festival in Sydney.

In March of this year, Canadian hip-hop star Jahkoy Palmer confirmed he had split from Tammy following their on/off romance which first began in June 2019.

It was then believed Tammy was in a relationship with New York-based rapper Erick Delgado during the early COVID-19 lockdown period. Their romance was never confirmed.

Tammy's happy relationship news comes less than two weeks after her ex Reece revealed that he was expecting his first child with London Goheen.

The announcement came just weeks after they got engaged.

American model London, 22, made the announcement on Instagram, sharing a sweet image of herself kissing influencer Reece, 25.

Tammy and Reece split in 2018 after five years of dating. They share custody of two children: son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four.

Speaking recently about she coped following her split from Reece, Tammy said on the Hanging with the Hembrows podcast that she focused on herself and her children while nursing a broken heart.
