A teenage killer who did a ‘dance of death’ after stabbing a pupil on a bus to settle a ‘school beef’ has been jailed for life at the Old Bailey today.

Marvin Dyer, 16, plunged a combat knife through the heart and lungs of 15-year-old Baptista Adjei as revenge for jokes told about him on Snapchat.

The killer boarded the 241 bus in Stratford, east London, after a friend on the top deck tipped him off that Baptista was about to get off.

Wearing a balaclava and a single blue latex glove he confronted Baptista as he came down the stairs and stabbed him twice.

A second 15-year old was knifed in the arm and knee.

Dyer was later caught dancing on CCTV after a friend told him Baptista had died on the phone on on October 10.

He was only caught because his own mother marched him to Forest Gate Police Station and handed him in when he told her of the attack.

Judge John Hillen QC lifted an order today banning the press from reporting Dyer’s name or publishing his picture. 

He said: ‘There is no evidence or no sufficient evidence from which I could determine that lifting anonymity would cause harm to Marvin Dyer, or affect his rehabilitation.’

Baptista Adjei, 15, pictured by his former football team, was stabbed to death in Stratford, east London 

Jailing Dyer for life with a minimum of 16 years, he continued: ‘You were just six weeks older then him. You have your life, you have taken Baptista’s away leaving what his family described as a massive void in their lives.

‘He was a popular boy much loved who showed promise at school and it sports.. He and his family had dreams for the future which will never be fulfilled..

‘You have not only taken a life but blighted the lives of many other who knew and loved Baptista. You and your victim had fallen out on social media over a bit of inter-school banter.

‘Already the all to regular spectre of obsession with knives and violence was all too obvious.

‘You always intended Baptista should die. There was a significant degree of planning and pre-meditation and there was no immediate provocation and the Snapchat clearly was no justification for any assault.

‘You were armed with a knife and took it to the scene intending to commit murder. I am satisfied you were a mature 15 and now 16 year old. This was your own personal enterprise not a group attack. I do not consider you to be naïve but calculating.’

Baptista’s heartbroken mother, Josephine said: ‘This senseless killing has taken away his dreams.

‘I just cannot stop crying because his killing makes no sense, especially considering Baptista was such a good boy.

‘Baptista’s death has left a massive void in our lives we miss and think about him each day.' 

The court heard how Baptista managed to run off to a nearby McDonalds but he had been wounded in the heart and he collapsed and died there.

Minutes after the attack the killer was caught on CCTV dancing after a phone call from a friend informed him the schoolboy had died.

While giving evidence about the attack, Dyer told the jury: ‘I didn’t really feel anything.' 

Police and paramedics found Baptista with 'critical injuries' and despite battling to save his life he was pronounced dead at the scene near the shopping centre at 3.49pm. Pictured: Police treat the surviving teenager in Stratford

He said he was enraged because Baptista had called him a ‘midget’ two weeks before in a heated group chat involving rival east London schools.

The second victim described it as ‘like a school beef chat.’

A jury took 21 hours and 59 minutes to convict Dyer of murder as members of the victim’s family audibly sighed with relief as they heard the verdict.

But a second youth, also 16, was cleared of murder and unlawful wounding. 

Baptista’s heartbroken mother, Josephine said: ‘I just cannot stop crying because his killing makes no sense, especially considering Baptista was such a good boy'

Dyer told his mother the day after the murder: ‘I’m the one that stabbed both of them’.

In the group chat the killer had been taunted by Baptista’s friends who called him: ‘wet’, a ‘bullying victim’ and a ‘midget.’

Furiously the killer retorted: ‘If you’ve got no bodies on your blade, leave the group chat.’

The boy explained he bought the knives for him and his co-accused in Reading from a dealer on Snapchat for £20 each.

After the attack he went to Little Ilford Park and dumped a bin liner containing the grey and blue tracksuit he had been wearing at the time of the stabbing.

Five days later police used his mobile phone data to recover the bin liner and the Rambo knife was found under a hedge nearby.

Prosecutor Deanna Heer said: ‘It is a shocking case. The killer said that they teased him about his height, and that he was bullied and that he was wet and all that was in front of 32 participants.

‘In the CCTV clip he appears to be throwing his hands and dancing to the music. Is that consistent with being upset and scared?

But Dyer insisted he did not intend for his victim to die.

He told the court: ‘I thought he tripped at the time.

‘I did not feel anything to be honest with you. He got stabbed but I did not think it was bad.

‘I saw it on the news and I checked to see it was true. I was scared. I was playing music - it keeps me calm.’

Dyer formerly of east London, admitted manslaughter but denied murder, and wounding with intent. 

He was convicted of murder but cleared of wounding with intent.

The second defendant, also 16 and from east London, denied murder and was acquitted.

He was also cleared of unlawful wounding.
