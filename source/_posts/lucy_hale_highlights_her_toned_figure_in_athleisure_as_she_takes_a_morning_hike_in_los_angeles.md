She soaked up the sun last week while vacation in Mexico's Cabo San Lucas.

But Lucy was back home in Los Angeles on Monday as she worked on her fit figure with a scenic height.

The 31-year-old Pretty Little Liars star was spotted working up a sweat in LA's Studio City neighborhood while wearing a set of olive-colored athleisure clothing.

Lucy's outfit included a sleeveless crop top from Gymshark with a cooling mesh crescent over her chest.

She matched it with high-waisted olive leggings that revealed a hint of her toned midriff. 

The 5ft2in actress helped block out the sun with a blue LA Dodgers baseball cap and a pair of square military-style aviator sunglasses.

She completed her ensemble with a set of black trainers while strapping black weights to her ankles for an extra-potent workout.

Lucy brought along a water in a Starbucks cup to help stay hydrated, and she carried a green hip bag slung across her shoulders.

While some haven't been able to keep up with their regular fitness regimen throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Lucy has been increasing her training with the help of celebrity trainer Adam Nicklas.

She now regularly augments her workouts wit the use of resistance bands and weights, like the ankle weights she wore for her hike.

The actress has had more time to focus on herself following the cancellation of her Riverdale spin-off series Katy Keene, which the CW ended after a single season.  

She has been very open about her disappointment over the musical comedy drama series ending 'prematurely' after stating she wanted it to continue on for many more seasons.

She was reminded of the show's failure by a tweet from Schitt's Creek co-creator Dan Levy, who referenced is show's sweep of the comedy series awards at the Emmy's on Sunday.

'A gentle reminder that TV shows need space and time to lay foundation, to develop, and to grow. In the wrong hands, this show would have been yanked off the air in season one for "underperforming,"' read the tweet that Lucy shared to her Instagram Stories.

'This is some food for thought,' she wrote after congratulating Levy.

Last week, Lucy took some time off from LA to relax in Mexico's Cabo San Lucas.
