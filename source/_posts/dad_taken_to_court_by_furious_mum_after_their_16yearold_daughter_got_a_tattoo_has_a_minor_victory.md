Bradley Victory (pictured), 45, from Tahmoor was charged over his teenage daughter's tattoo

A truckie who was taken to court by his ex-wife after letting their teenage daughter get a tattoo is celebrating a minor win in a case that's torn the family apart.   

Bradley Victory, 45, admits allowing his daughter Casey to get a dreamcatcher tattoo on her ankle at Picton Tattoos in Sydney's south-west last year, when she was aged 16.

His ex-wife Nadene Rae Rees has lodged court proceedings over the incident, alleging the decision was made without her consent. 

Mr Victory was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  

But after a court appearance at Picton Local Court on Wednesday, the latter charge was dropped.

'If I thought it was going to cause this much drama I would have waited until she was 18, and it would have saved me and her a lot of grief,' Mr Victory told A Current Affair. 

'I'll do anything for Casey. I would go to extremes to protect my daughter and all my kids. They mean the world to me.'

Minors are required written permission from a parent or guardian to get a piercing or tattoo under New South Wales law.

Casey did have the consent of her father, who she said she has lived with for the past three years.   

'I thought it would be nice to have a nice dreamcatcher on my ankle,' she said, lamenting the situation her father is now in. 

'He's the best dad I could ever ask for. He does everything for me. Teaches me how to do stuff. I can go to him about anything, can ask him anything. When I need help he's always there for me.'

The dreamcatcher symbolises good luck in native American culture and the image had a significant meaning for the teenager at the time.

'Casey came to me and asked me "dad, can I get a tattoo?' She said "I really want a tattoo, I want to put the past behind me",' Mr Victory said. 

'I've got tattoos, so I can't really be a hypocrite.'

Sydney Lawyer Sam Macedone has questioned Ms Rees' decision to bring the issue before the courts.

When Nadene Rees (pictured), from Hilltop, discovered the tattoo she was furious, taking legal action against her ex-husband

'This is not common at all in a criminal court. This is a matter between ex-husband, ex-wife. To have a criminal prosecution, where one parent gives consent to his daughter to get a tattoo - which is quite legal - then I don't understand what this is all about,' Mr Macedone said.

'There are other ways of dealing with this matter. But having this man charged with wounding his daughter or assaulting her is, in my mind, ridiculous.'  

Mr Victory is hopeful the day's court proceedings will be a sign of things to come.

'It's very good, I'm very pleased that [one charge] was withdrawn – hopefully the rest will get thrown out later on,' Mr Victory told the Daily Telegraph.

'I want to get all of this out of the way … I've just had enough.' 

Casey, now 17, continues to stand by her father throughout the ordeal.

'They can pick a side if they think I'm right and dad's right or my mother's right, but I think we've done the right thing. I'm pretty sure we're in the right,' she said.

A hearing will be held next year for the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

If he is convicted he could face up to five years in jail.
