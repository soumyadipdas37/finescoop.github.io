Police broke up a party of more than 1,000 Florida State University students a day after the state's bars and restaurants were opened to full capacity.

The Tallahassee Police Department responded to more than a dozen calls about crowds over the weekend, including the 700-vehicle party on Dixie Drive just before midnight Saturday.

More than 1,000 revellers partied outside the Tenn Street Apartments in Tallahassee, two miles from Florida State University's campus, requiring police to use a helicopter to disperse the crowd.

Most of the travel lanes in the student apartment complex were blocked and TPD’s Patrol Bureau and the Leon County Sheriff’s Office helicopter broke up the party.

It comes after the university's president wrote to students telling them to social distance and avoid all gatherings last month.

In a separate party, two men were hospitalised after gunfire broke out at a party near the Circle K on S Monroe Street on Sunday just before 5am.

One victim was treated and released, while the other is in serious but stable condition. It is not yet clear whether the victims are affiliated with the university.

Tallahassee Police said: 'A dispute broke out, resulting in gunfire. Initial information indicates multiple shots were fired from different weapons. 

'Several cars in and around the parking lot were struck. The shooting continued north on S. Monroe Street.

'Officers located additional evidence of the shooting on the 2500 block of S. Monroe St.'

Investigators ask anyone who may have witnessed the incident but did not speak with an officer on scene, or anyone with information about the shooting to please call 850-891-4200.

The huge gatherings come as coronavirus cases among students at Florida State University have soared to more than 1,500 since testing began in August.

Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis denounced university crackdowns on parties and said he would seek a 'bill of rights' to protect students who could be expelled for partying.

He said: 'I understand that universities are trying to do the right thing but I personally think it's dramatically draconian that a student could get potentially expelled for going to a party.

'That’s what college kids do,' reported News4JAX.

DeSantis reiterated his stance that students are low-risk for the coronavirus and credited universities for not going 'overboard' in measures against students. 

His comments came after FSU President John Thrasher appealed for students to wear masks and stay six feet apart, and avoid all parties and large gatherings.

In a letter to students he wrote: 'The choices you make don't just impact you. 

'They affect your friends, families, professors, FSU staff and the Tallahassee community at large, as well as our ability to hold in-person classes and future events and provide campus services,' reported CNN.

He added: 'Noncompliance with the expectations outlined in our Fall 2020 plan will not be tolerated.

'We must demonstrate our commitment to each other and this great university by doing everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19,' reported Politico.

Florida reported its lowest coronavirus case rise since June on Monday, recording 738 new infections.

It takes the state's total to 701,302 cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began with at least 14,037 deaths.

DeSantis announced on Friday that effective immediately Florida moved to phase three of the coronavirus reopening plan with bars and restaurants at full capacity.

Dr Anthony Fauci openly criticised DeSantis's decision, describing it as 'very concerning' yesterday.
