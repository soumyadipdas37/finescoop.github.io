Need help cleaning your carpets or want to make your well-loved carpet or sofa look brand new?

For a limited time, shoppers can snag Amazon's most popular Bissell SpotClean Pro portable carpet cleaner for 13 per cent off.

Now £129.99 reduced from £149.99, the Bissell SpotClean Pro portable carpet cleaner is currently Amazon's number one bestselling carpet washer. And it pays for itself within one use, allowing you to tackle home cleaning of fabrics for a professional-level clean without calling in the pros.

Now £129, the the Bissell SpotClean Pro portable carpet cleaner lift spots and stains from carpets, rugs, upholstery, stairs, auto interiors and more

Nearly 1,000 shoppers have given the cleaning gadget a perfect five-star rating thanks to its stellar stain-busting performance, ability to target spills and tackle areas such as the stairs with ease. 

But they also love that it's highly portable and easy to store - perfect if you don't want a large, bulky carpet cleaner taking up valuable storage space.

Best for small jobs, the carpet washer comes with three handy attachments, uses water, formula and powerful suction to clean and protect soft surfaces, and features separate clean and dirty water tanks. 

And it's versatile enough that it can be used on upholstery, sofas, carpets and rugs, plus small areas like your car interior.

Shoppers rave about the Bissell SpotClean Pro's lightweight and manoeuvrable design and overall cleaning power. Reviewers call it a 'superb machine' and a 'good investment', saying the 'amount of dirt it lifts is amazing'.

'So lightweight and easy to lift and fits perfectly on a stair for easy use,' one customer wrote. 'I don't know what I have done without this beauty. Saved me a fortune in buying a new carpet.'

Another shopper wrote: 'Really great buy, this machine has saved me buying a new mattress, the dog had an accident, and this machine made the mattress look like new again. Very impressed used it on the rugs after and again they came up like new, so glad I bought this.'

A third customer agreed added: 'Brilliant machine. Much better results than expected and has already paid for itself by bringing up kitchen/dining carpet tiles like new. Good on car seats too. Leaves carpets slightly damp and dry after a few hours.'

The Bissell SpotClean Pro also comes with a sample size bottle of Wash and Protect Professional Formula for optimal spot and stain cleaning results.
