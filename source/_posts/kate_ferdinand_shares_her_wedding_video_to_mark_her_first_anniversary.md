She's currently expecting her first child, a boy, with husband Rio Ferdinand.

And Kate Ferdinand celebrated a milestone as she marked her first year of marriage by sharing a heartwarming clip from her nuptials onto Instagram on Sunday.

The ex-TOWIE star, 29, treated her followers to a glimpse of her epic three-day wedding weekend at D Maris Bay hotel in Turkey, complete with a pool party, a romantic outdoor ceremony and a surprise performance from singer Ashanti.

'I will cherish this forever': Kate Ferdinand celebrated a milestone as she marked her first year of marriage by sharing a heartwarming clip from her nuptials to Rio on Instagram on Sunday

The clip started off with the couple, who started dating in January 2017, arriving at their lively pool bash, which boasted an appearance from famous butcher Nusret 'Salt Bae' Gökçe.

The following day, the blonde beauty walked down the aisle with her stepsons Lorenz, 14, and Tate, 11, before she and the former footballer, 41, exchanged I do's and sealed their new relationship status with a kiss.

The influencer looked sensational in an ivory fishtail Berta gown, while her long-term partner cut a dapper figure in a dark suit.

The newlyweds later partied into the early hours of the morning with their loved ones at their fun-filled reception, which saw musician Ashanti raise the roof with a rendition of her single Into You with Fabolous.

The former reality star wrote alongside the clip: '1 year today ❤️. All emotional watching this. memories I will cherish forever... The best weekend with our family and friends. I love you baby @rioferdy5.' (sic) 

Kate and Rio announced their engagement in November 2018 after he proposed to her on a family trip to Abu Dhabi with his three children.

Two years prior to their relationship, the presenter tragically lost his first wife Rebecca to breast cancer at the age of just 34. 

Earlier this week, Kate admitted she is struggling with being a step-mum and being pregnant while facing mental health battles.

Oh baby! The fitness enthusiast is currently expecting her first child, a boy, with ex-Manchester United ace Rio, 41

The media personality candidly discussed battling anxiety and 'really struggling' during her first trimester on the Women's Health Going for Goal podcast. 

She said: 'Lockdown has been an experience. Obviously I was pregnant and the children didn't know, and something I've struggled with is being pregnant with my first biological child and still being a mum.

'So I felt I had all these new experiences… but I was still a stepmother or mother figure to three kids. I struggle with my mental health. Being active helps day-to-day with my anxiety, so when I can't do things, I struggle with it.'

Admitting slowing down is a problem for her, she said: 'So when I can't do things, I really struggle with it…I want to do everything. Rio says to me 'Kate, just sit down. You just need to sit down and relax'...

'But I don't know why, I just feel guilty when I do. [Anxiety is] something I've suffered with from when I can remember. It can start over the simplest thing, and it's just my mind playing tricks on me and can get out of control...

'But I do find that when I exercise or go for a walk, I seem to feel better for the day.'
