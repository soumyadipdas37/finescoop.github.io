Jockey Ryan Moore has entered a two-week quarantine period in Ireland so he will be able to ride at Irish Champions weekend at Leopardstown on Saturday week and the Curragh the following afternoon.

Moore is No 1 jockey to trainer Aidan O'Brien but COVID-19 restrictions mean he has been unable to ride in Ireland this season.

Speaking in his Betfair blog, the three-time champion jockey said: 'Irish Champions Weekend is so important that it made total sense for me to come over. It is a major meeting that you always want to be part of. It is a shame that there will be no one on track, but it is a fantastic programme of racing with top-class horses.

'I am not sure what I will be riding yet - but I imagine the likes of Magical, Japan, Peaceful, Fancy Blue and Battleground, and plenty of others besides, will all be in the mix.

'I am also not certain what I am going to do on my own for the next 10 days or so, but it is no big deal in the grand scheme of things, and at least the prospect of riding on two of Ireland's best, most important and prestigious days in the Flat calendar will hopefully make the time go quicker.'

Moore's decision means he will miss the Pertemps St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday week. He was expected to ride O'Brien's Irish Derby winner Santiago in the final Classic of the season.

Frankie Dettori has been undergoing quarantine after a success stint riding in France. He is pencilled in to ride at Chelmsford on Thursday ahead of taking the mount on dual Arc winner Enable in the September Stakes at Kempton on Saturday.
