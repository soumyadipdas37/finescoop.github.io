Jad Nehmetallah is known for his witty commentary on Gogglebox Australia, where he shares the couch with his friends Matty and Sarah Marie Fahd. 

And now the Channel 10 reality star has finally addressed speculation he is being considered as next year's Bachelor.

Speaking to Lifestyle, Jad, 34 said: 'It's insane how many people online and in person have been mentioning it.'

Setting the record straight: Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah has finally addressed rumours he is being considered as a candidate for next year's season of Channel 10's The Bachelor

'I am interested in finding love and starting a family but I'm having way too much fun with Matty and Sarah Marie on the couch to do anything else,' he added.

'And Malik's not ready to take over my seat just yet, so I'll be holding onto it for as long as I can!'

'I've been busy working hard and spending my time working with charities, supporting businesses during COVID,' he admits.

Sitting pretty: 'I am interested in finding love and starting a family but I'm having way too much fun with Matty and Sarah Marie on the couch to do anything else,' he added

He previously told the website he had imagined his life at 34 to be different.

'I always pictured myself married by now with two to three kids,' he said at the time.

It comes as his co-stars Matty and Sarah Marie jokingly said Jad wouldn't be the best candidate for the role as The Bachelor.

Mr Popular: This isn't the first time Jad has been linked to the Bachelor franchise. An insider told Woman's Day in 2018: 'Gogglebox has consistently rated well for Ten and Jad is a hot favourite with the viewers'

'I think his mum would get involved and knock back all the contestants and ask them to recast - that's my bet!' Matty, 33, told WHO magazine. 

Matty, who has been Jad's best friend for more than 10 years, added: 'It would make good television, but I don't think Jad would be very happy by the end.'  

'Gogglebox has consistently rated well for Ten and Jad is a hot favourite with the viewers,' an insider told Woman's Day in 2018. 

'His mum would get involved!' Matty (right) and Sarah Marie (centre) were asked about the gossip this week, and they jokingly said Jad (left) wouldn't be the best candidate for the role

'He's a genuinely down-to-earth guy who ladies love,' the source added.

Despite these rumours, Jad has made no secret of the fact he doesn't like reality dating shows.

'I have no time for The Bachelor or Married at First Sight,' he once said.

Rumours: Channel 10 is known to recruit Bachelors and Bachelorettes from its own ranks, making Jad's involvement not beyond the realm of possibility. The current Bachelor is former Australian Survivor star Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert (left), and last year's Bachelorette was Angie Kent (right), formerly of Gogglebox
