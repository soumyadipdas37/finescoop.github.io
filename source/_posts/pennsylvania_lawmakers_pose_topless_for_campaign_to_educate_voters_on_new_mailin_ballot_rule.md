A trio of female lawmakers from Pennsylvania have posed topless for a new get-out-the-vote campaign which aims to educate voters on new mail-in ballot rules that were announced in the state for the upcoming election. 

Allegheny County council members Bethany Hallam, 30, and Liv Bennett, 42, and House candidate Emily Kinkead, 33, all went nearly nude for the attention-grabbing campaign, which warns voters not to forget to seal their mail-in ballots inside the provided secrecy envelope — or else they'll be thrown out by election officials.

'Desperate times call for desperate measures!' Hallam tweeted last week. 'So your favorite elected officials got naked so that you remember to make sure that your mail-in ballot is NOT submitted without its secrecy envelope!'

Vote! A trio of female lawmakers from Pennsylvania have posed topless for a new get-out-the-vote campaign which aims to educate voters on new mail-in ballot rules

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that ballots not sealed inside the secrecy envelope can be rejected (pictured: Emily Kinkead, who is running for a state House seat in the 20th District)

On September 17, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that 'naked ballots' — those not sealed inside the secrecy envelope — can be rejected by election officials.

Some are predicting that this could lead to up to 100,000 Pennsylvania ballots being thrown out. 

So candidates in the state have begun launching initiatives to educate voters on the new rule to ensure that all ballots will be counted. 

Certainly the most distinctive one so far was released by Hallam, Bennett, and Kinkead, who all posed nude from the waist up in front of a brick wall.

Those very important secrecy ballots were Photoshopped over their chests for privacy — and to make their point. 

'No one wants a naked politician — or a naked ballot!' tweeted Kinkead, who is running for a state House seat in the 20th District. 'Don't forget your secrecy envelope when you mail in your ballot.' 

'If we have to get naked to get this message across, that’s what we’re willing to do,' said Allegheny County council member Bethany Hallam

'Desperate times call for desperate measures!' Hallam, 30, tweeted last week

'No one wants a naked politician — or a naked ballot!' tweeted Kinkead

Running along the bottom of one version of the ad are the words: 'The public doesn't need to see everything. Don't forget your secrecy envelope!' 

Another reads: 'Whoops! Good thing I've got my secrecy envelope!'

The campaign also includes step by step instructions for how to properly fill out and enclose a mail-in ballot.  

'If you don’t do even one of those two things, your ballot will be thrown out and you won’t even know,' Hallam told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'If we have to get naked to get this message across, that’s what we’re willing to do.

'There’s a lot misinformation going around about mail-in voting. It’s brand new. Most voters, this is the first time they’re ever voting by mail,' she went on.

'I reached out to my friends who are elected officials, as well, and I was like, "Hey, I have this wild idea. Let’s get naked to try to save our democracy."' 

'There’s a lot misinformation going around about mail-in voting. It’s brand new. Most voters, this is the first time they’re ever voting by mail,' said Hallam (left; Kinkead pictured right)

Kinkead is glad to see that it has caught the public's attention. 

'People are talking about it. It’s getting a lot of attention to just the existence of secrecy ballots,' she said. 'We’re getting people who are saying, "I didn’t even know about the secrecy envelope."'

Liv Bennett, who also posed for the campaign, is an Allegheny County council member

'I’m not just trying to protect Democratic voters,' added Hallam. 'I’m trying to make sure all voters ballots are counted.'

The campaign has earned plenty of positive feedback, with commenters calling it 'awesome,' 'amazing,' 'brilliant,' 'clever,' and 'wonderful' — and several calling for male candidates to do a version, too.

'This is... quite a unique method to talk about naked ballots in PA. 10/10 for originality. Remember, your voting rights “are real. And they are fantastic!”' wrote Michigan news anchor Nick LaFave.

In fact, the posts had few critics — though among them was the women's colleague Keith Rothfus, a Republican in Pennsylvania's 12th District.

'And this is the crowd that thinks @RealDonaldTrump is vulgar? Really?' he tweeted. 'So looking forward to confirmation of #ACB as our next #SupremeCourt Justice.'

Kinkead fired back: 'Now powerless man who spent career working to deny women ownership of their bodies and power is big mad that women in power are owning their bodies.'
