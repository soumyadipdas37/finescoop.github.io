A firefighter has died battling a wildfire in California that officials say was sparked by a device used to reveal a baby's gender as crews continue to battle more than two dozen major fires across the state.   

The firefighter died on Thursday in the San Bernardino National Forest as crews battled the El Dorado Fire.

Authorities say they won't release the name of the firefighter until family members are notified. The cause of the firefighter's death is under investigation, the US Forest Service said in a statement. 

'Our deepest sympathies are with the family, friends and fellow firefighters during this time,' Forest Service spokesperson Zach Behrens said. 

No other information was released about the firefighter, the agency the firefighter worked for or the circumstances of the firefighter's death.

The fire erupted on September 5 when a couple staged a baby gender reveal at El Dorado Ranch Park at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains.

Authorities say a smoke-generating pyrotechnic device sparked the blaze after it was set off in a field and quickly ignited dry grass. 

The couple frantically tried to use bottled water to extinguish the flames and called 911. 

The wildfire has already burned nearly 30 square miles and is about 66 percent contained, according to Cal Fire. The fire has destroyed 10 buildings and damaged six others. 

Authorities have not released the identities of the couple, who could face criminal charges and be held liable for the cost of fighting the fire. 

It comes as more than 17,000 firefighters continue to battle more than two dozen major wildfires in California. 

The blazes are blamed for at least 25 deaths.

Crews continue to battle more than two dozen major fires across California - the most populous US state

A front of humid and rainy weather on Friday aided the efforts of weary emergency crews and brought some relief to a region that has suffered a historically devastating fire season. 

The deadly wildfires have raged for weeks due to tinderbox conditions created by high winds, lightning and drought.  

The region still faces a formidable recovery from the fires, which have burned some 3.2 million acres in California since mid-August and another 1.7 million acres in Oregon and Washington state since Labor Day.

Several small towns have largely been incinerated, with thousands of dwellings destroyed and at least 35 lives lost - 26 in California, including the firefighter - eight in Oregon, and one in Washington state. 

Thousands of evacuees, especially in Oregon, remained huddled in emergency shelters, mobile trailers and hotel rooms. 

The situation was particularly dire in Oregon, a state unaccustomed to wildfires of such magnitude and lacking sufficient resources to deal with them.

Oregon's firefighting force has more than doubled over the past week, with some 6,500 personnel on the fire lines. 

CalFire said more than 17,400 firefighters were deployed against 26 fires in the most populous state.
