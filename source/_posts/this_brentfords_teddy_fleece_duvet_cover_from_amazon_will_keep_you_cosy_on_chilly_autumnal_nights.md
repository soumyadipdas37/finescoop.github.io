With the evenings drawing in and temperatures slowly dropping, it's time to dust off the polo necks and give in to the new season. 

A cosy blanket is an autumn essential, and this year we recommend that you up the comfort dial a notch with the Brentfords Teddy Fleece Duvet Cover.

Imagine the softest, fleeciest blanket merged with your duvet and you'll have the Brentfords Teddy Fleece Duvet Cover. Hundreds of Amazon shoppers have already bought, and loved, the teddy duvet set, calling it 'so cosy and perfect for winter nights', 'very soft and snuggly' and 'soft bliss'.

The £14.99 Brentfords Teddy Fleece Duvet Cover is racking up five star reviews from shoppers who can't get enough of the cuddly, fleecy material 

And, at only £14.99 for a double duvet, it's irresistibly affordable too.  

We've all been guilty of falling asleep on the sofa cuddled under a favourite blanket, but now thanks to the Brentfords Teddy Fleece Duvet Cover, you won't have to be prised away.

The fleece duvet cover is the perfect winter warmer and has gained plenty of attention with over 1,000 ratings on Amazon and an impressive average rating of 4.6 out of 5. In fact, over 80 per cent of shoppers have left the blanket a full five stars.  

The plush teddy fleece finish makes the blanket super soft to the touch whilst being irresistibly warm and cosy. If you struggle to get out of bed on a cold winter mornings, this will only make it harder. But it's worth it.     

One reviewer wrote: 'Oh my this quilt set is too soft and comfy to the point I can't get out of bed in the mornings. Seriously great set, so warm and cuddly really chuffed with the quality great price for a super king too.'

Another shopper added: 'Being in bed with this bedding is heaven, its warm soft and cosy and just what I needed for the winter months. Best bedding I've ever bought that's for sure.'  

The super snug Brentfords fleece duvet set also comes with two pillow cases for maximum comfort and in sizes from single to super king. 

The Brentfords Teddy Fleece Duvet Cover comes in Blush Pink, Charcoal Grey, Cream Ivory, Grey Silver and Latte Beige

The teddy fleece duvet cover comes in five neutral shades, including Blush Pink and Charcoal Grey, so is sure to blend in seamlessly with all interior tastes.  

 'Snuggle central, a shopper wrote in their review. 'So comfortable to get into, and the fleece feels so nice on your face. It's a really lovely set, especially for the price.'

Another wrote: 'I love this duvet set so soft and comfortable!!! It's like cuddling a massive teddy bear, lovely texture and material! Definitely recommend to anyone who loves soft things like myself!'

If you're concerned about how the duvet set washes, it's worth taking note of this review that states: 'Sooo warm and fluffy! The quality is probably not on par with M&S, or next or any other of the big brands so maybe not quite as soft. 

'But it IS delightfully warm. Some people have commented that it shrinks when you wash it. I've washed this at 40  degrees and it has always been fine.'
