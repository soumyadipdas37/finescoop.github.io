They've had a rollercoaster year but have been closer than ever in recent months.

And Jacqueline Jossa and Dan Osborne looked smitten as they whisked their daughters Ella, five, and Mia, two to Alton Towers for a fun family weekend.

The foursome spent the weekend in a luxury cabin and had fun in the pool at the park's Splash Landings area, with the couple proudly sharing snaps on Instagram.

Jacqueline posted a sweet snap on Sunday as she cosied up to Ella while they waited to get on a ride at the amusement park.

'You make me understand the meaning of proud,' the doting mum captioned the smiley photo.

Dan meanwhile shared snaps as he strolled around the accomodation area of the park, gushing about his 'cute' daughter Mia after they had enjoyed six hours on Sunday at Splash Landings.

Weekend away: Dan and Jacqueline have been making the most of family time during the recent lockdown

Dan and Jacqueline have been making the most of family time during the recent lockdown after a bumpy start, which saw the actress briefly move out of the family home. 

Former TOWIE star Dan went on to admit that he had been unfaithful to his long-term partner and that she had forgiven him for his past indiscretions. 

The fun family weekend comes after Jacqueline confessed this month that it was 'hard' to let her little girl Ella go to school after six months at home, but she knew her daughter was 'ready' for her first day of Year One. 

In a lengthy caption, the TV star told fans she struggled to say goodbye to Ella after taking her back to school, but praised her for handling the changes so well after weeks being holed up at home.

 'We love you': Jacqueline recently admitted it was 'hard' to let her little girl Ella, five, go to school after six months at home

She candidly said: 'That's the school run done. A little watery-eyed, Mia cried her eyes out.

'Ella was fine, Ella went in she was really good I'm so proud of her, no tears. She was really ready for it really proud of her.

'Me and Dan waved her off and stared through the window for a while Mia had a little cry bless her. I didn't like it I'm not gonna lie, I'm gonna miss her.'
