NRL star Luke Keary, 28 and his wife Amy, 28, are expecting their second child. 

The couple, who are already parents to one-year-old son Hudson Van, announced the exciting news via Facebook on Tuesday.   

'Luke, Hudson and I are super excited to announce that we will be welcoming another family member in March 2021,' the expectant mother wrote, making sure to tag Luke's page.
