Heidi Klum and Helena Christensen have joined a slew of stars donning an array of eclectic ensembles for Christian Cowan's Spring/Summer 2021 collection.

Posing for a jaw-dropping shoot, the designer's unisex collections boasts plenty of excess, with oversized bows, PVC and punk spikes galore.

Cowan's latest shoot comes as much of the fashion industry has ground to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many fashion shows either cancelled or scaled back to allow for social distancing.

Wow! Heidi Klum has joined a slew of stars donning an array of eclectic ensembles for Christian Cowan's Spring/Summer 2021 collection

Heidi proudly displayed her modelling prowess in a reflective rainbow PVC dress with an enormous bow and matching thigh-high boots.

The America's Got Talent judge allowed the dress itself - a true sight to behold - to take centre stage.

Meanwhile Helena was clad in head-to-toe PVC, this time in the form of a daring pink gown with enormous bow detailing, along with boots, gloves and a furry black headpiece.

Lil Nas X said: 'What I love about this collection is not only are the clothes super sick and show-stopping, but I m also really proud of what it represents and all the people that it will help. 

'Atlanta is my hometown and the LGBTQ+ community is some of the most at risk, so I'm glad that we'll be able to offer them some support.'

It was also announced that 100% of proceeds from sales of merchandise from the collection would be donated to a new fund at the Loveland Foundation that benefits the young Black queer community in Atlanta.
