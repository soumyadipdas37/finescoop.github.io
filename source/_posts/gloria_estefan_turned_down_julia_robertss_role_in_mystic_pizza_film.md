Gloria Estefan revealed she turned down the leading role in the 1988 coming-of-age film, Mystic Pizza, which was famously portrayed by a then-unknown Julia Roberts. 

During her virtual appearance on Tuesday's Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the three-time Grammy winner revealed she was first offered the iconic role.

After a fan asked the performer if she had ever passed on a song that eventually became a hit, the 63-year-old singer divulged that she was almost Daisy Araújo.

'Not a song because I usually write most of my songs and I recorded most of them, but I will tell you a movie role I passed on – Mystic Pizza,' she confessed, which left  Cohen stunned.  

She continued: ‘I thought, one day I will do acting but I’m not going to throw myself into this and not be good at it. So it then went to Julia Roberts, and she even had my long curly hair.’ 

The 52-year-old television host then interjected, 'No biggie, the movie that made Julia Roberts a superstar.'

Despite the opportunity paving Roberts' successful career on the silver screen,  Estefan told the Bravo vet she 'would not have been ready' for it. 

She noted it 'was awesome' to see how Mystic Pizza served as a launching pad for the Oscar winner, 52, who starred in Pretty Woman and Steel Magnolias just two years later. 

While the Cuban-American star is known legendary music career, she has appeared in the films Music Of The Heart (1999) and For Love Or Country: The Arturo Sandoval (2000).

Additionally, she portrayed the mother of the late Naya Rivera's Glee character  Santana Lopez in 2012.

She has since gone on to bring in nearly $3 billion at the box office with her roles in Erin Brockovich, My Best Friend's Wedding, Eat Pray Love, Notting Hill and more.
