Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi will reportedly be offered a new contract at Stamford Bridge this summer, before heading out on loan with a number of Premier League clubs interested in the Belgian. 

Batshuayi was handed chances in the first-team last season under Frank Lampard, but after Timo Werner joined during this window, the 26-year-old is now further down the pecking order up front. 

Yet Chelsea do not want to lose the striker next season on a free transfer and so are set to offer Batshuayi a new deal - including a £15,000 pay-rise to £100,000-a-week - and then ship him out on loan, according to The Sun.

But the Belgian striker will then leave the club on loan, with Premier League sides interested

The report details that among the clubs interested in Batshuayi are Crystal Palace - where the Belgian previously spent half-a-season on loan - West Brom and Newcastle United. 

Batshuayi spent the latter-half of the 2018-19 season on loan at Selhurst Park, scoring five Premier League goals, and Palace are keen on him again. 

Yet Palace are also keen on young Chelsea starlet Conor Gallagher, with Premier League rules stating both could not move to the same club on temporary deals. 

Newly-promoted Leeds are also interested in Gallagher, who is a midfielder who is currently starring for England Under-21s. 

But Batshuayi, who scored just six times in 24 appearances for Chelsea last season, looks to be heading to the exit door after an underwhelming four years with the club. 

He signed amid much promise in the summer of 2016 from Marseille for £32million, yet was a bit-part player from the off under Antonio Conte.

That being said, he scored the goal which clinched the 2016-17 Premier League title at West Brom.

Yet the following season, Batshuayi moved on loan to Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, where he effectively replaced Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who had just joined Arsenal. 

Loan spells at Valencia and Palace followed, before a second chance by Lampard was not capitalised on last season.
