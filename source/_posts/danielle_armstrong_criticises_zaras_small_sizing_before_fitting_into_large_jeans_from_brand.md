Danielle Armstrong criticised High Street clothing brand Zara for its 'small' sizing in a candid Instagram clip shared on Tuesday.

The former TOWIE star, 32, blasted the retailer for categorising sizes 12-14 as 'large', after she initially struggled to fit into jeans from the company.

Six weeks on, the new mother, who welcomed her daughter Orla with fiancé Tom Edney in May, enthused she 'feels like her old self' as she managed to slip into the same pair of denim bottoms.

The reality star started from her walk-in wardrobe: 'I'm excited. So six weeks ago, I went shopping. After you have a baby, it's so hard.

'You don't know what fashion suits you in your body that doesn't even feel like you're body as you had a baby in there.'

The media personality went on to discuss her frustration at Zara's sizes running small as she said: 'I went to Zara and bought loads of stuff and I put these UK size 12 jeans on. I was a size 14-16 after having Orla, and we all know Zara, they are not very good with their sizing!

'Anyone that is in Zara that watches this head office wise, I don't think it's good that a large is 12-14, as if that's a large!

'I came home and tried all my stuff on and it was a disaster. I could not get these jeans up six weeks ago, it was impossible. Tom told me to keep them and I refused, but ended up losing the receipt.'

Danielle ended her clip by sharing her delight at finally managing to squeeze into the items after losing some weight. 

The TV star said: 'I woke up this morning and thought I'm starting to feel a little bit like I did before I was pregnant, so I thought I'm going to give them jeans a try. 

'It just feels nice wearing a little vest and high-waisted jeans. It's been so long, I'm feeling good.'MailOnline has reached out to a Zara representative for comment. 

Danielle's post came just a few months after Jacqueline Jossa blasted Zara for its 'offensive' sizing, claiming being forced to wear an 'extra large' caused her to have a 'mental breakdown'.

'Offensive': Danielle's post came just a few months after Jacqueline Jossa blasted Zara for its sizing, claiming being forced to wear an 'extra large' caused her to have a 'mental breakdown'

The former EastEnders star, 27, took to Instagram to hit out at the fashion giant after she was left unable to fit into a pair of large shorts, despite being a size 12. 

The mum-of-two said at the time: 'Loads of people asked me about my Zara haul because I went shopping the other night. 

'To be honest, I had a mental breakdown yesterday basically because the sizing in Zara is offensive. Just not having it really. So I had to take a whole load of stuff back.' 

Jacqueline gave In The Style - the brand she recently launched a collection with - a plug and claimed it was much better at offering inclusive sizes, ranging from a 6 to a 24.

The video continued: 'Do you know what? I haven't shopped in for so long for anything but in the sale and it just goes to show me really that the sizing for InTheStyle is so good. That is what it is meant to be.'  

With the average dress size for women in the UK a size 16, the TV personality said she was worried about the impact on people shopping at the store who are over size 12. 

Jacqueline said: 'I was shocked when I got home yesterday honestly. I'm a size 12 and the large wouldn't fit me from Zara.

'I had to get the extra large which is not a problem but you know people who are over a size 14, size 16, size 18, do they just not shop in Zara? 

'I didn't know that, I wasn't aware of that and I haven't shopped in Zara for years. So I kind of remember why I don't shop in there anymore. 

'I love it but I think the sizing is really off. I did get some nice bits which I will show you. 

'But you should have seen me yesterday trying to squeeze into a pair of shorts and stuff. Should have filmed it but it wasn't a pretty sight.'
