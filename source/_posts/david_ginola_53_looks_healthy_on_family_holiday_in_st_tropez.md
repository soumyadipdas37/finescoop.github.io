David Ginola, 53, and his girlfriend Maëva Denat, 29, doted on their daughter, two, during an idyllic break in St.Tropez on Sunday. 

The football ace, who was recently ditched by the French version of Britain's Got Talent due to his extravagant demands, was enjoying a dip in the waters with the tot before enjoying some stolen moments of PDA with his stunning model partner. 

Clad in dark shorts and sporting compression tights on his calves, the silver fox looked youthful and hunky, four years on from his terrifying heart attack, while stunning Maëva wowed in a black bikini.

Cheeky! David Ginola, 53, and his girlfriend Maëva Denat, 29, packed on the PDA before doting on their daughter, two, during an idyllic break in St.Tropez on Sunday

David was proving himself to very much be back to rude health as he showcased his ripped arms during his frolic in the sea.  

He was sporting a pair of £45 Skins Calf Tights. The supports are described on the website as: 'SKINS Sport Calf Tights wrap your calves in medium-strength DNAmic Gradient Compression to power their performance and minimise risk of injury...

'This extra oxygen boost reduces lactic acid build-up while training and holds of DOMS, so you can take up the pace and push the extra mile.'

The couple confirmed their romance in June 2016, just weeks after he suffered a near-fatal heart attack and three months after announcing his separation from wife of 25 years, Coraline.

Oh my! The couple could not take their hands off one another 

Sweet: David was giving his partner a tender embrace on the shores 

The whole family: The duo were on hand to look after their two-year-old

All aboard! The whole group were larking around in the sea 

As well as their two-year-old daughter, Maeva also has a young daughter from a previous relationship, while David is father to son Andrea, 27 and daughter Carla, 23 from his marriage to Coraline.

David suffered a devastating heart attack while playing in a charity football match in France in May 2016, which he revealed left him 'clinically dead' for nine minutes.

He collapsed during the match, swallowed his tongue and had stopped breathing before he was revived by paramedics, who had arrived with a defibrillator.

Daddy dearest! David looked healthier than ever as he frolicked in the water 

Cheeky! He was enjoying some stolen moments of PDA with his stunning model partner

Making a splash! She was showing off the delicate inking on her shoulder 

He needed to be shocked four times before being airlifted to a hospital in Monaco, where he endured a six-hour quadruple bypass operation to clear his blocked arteries.

David appeared on This Morning in November 2018 to speak about the shortage of people who know first aid, with CPR playing a pivotal role in saving his life.

He said of the terrifying event: 'I was just playing football, and I just collapsed. There’s no warnings or alarms, no pain. I just collapsed. It's very strange as when you wake up, you don't feel any pain, so you ask yourself: Why are you here?'

Having a laugh: It was all fun and games for the whole family

Dipping away: David was giving his daughter all his attention in the water 

Stunner: Her black bikini was simple in design yet stunning in impact 

Stressing the importance of first aid, he continued: 'Someone on the pitch was able to perform CPR. There were probably 15 people there, and only one or two could do CPR.'

'That's when I realised something was wrong, only two people knew how to perform CPR?'

Speaking about the risks hereditary health issues pose, David explained: 'My mum died in 2005 from a heart attack. My dad had many problems with his heart. I heard that it was hereditary.'  

My girl: He was playing in the water with the tot 

Strutting their stuff: She was showing off her model figure
