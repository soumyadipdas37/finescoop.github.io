She may play Wonder Woman in the DC Comics movies.

But in real life, it's her husband who's clearly a superhero to Gal Gadot.

The Israeli actress, 35, took to Instagram on Monday to post a sweet tribute to real estate developer Yaron Varsano on the occasion of their 12th wedding anniversary.

Sharing a cute photo of herself with her husband, Gadot wrote in the caption: 'Happy anniversary @jaronvarsano .. you’re my one. My only. My everything.. '

She went on: '12 years of marriage feels like a walk in the park with you. To many more to come. I’m yours forever.'

Filming again: Earlier this month, Gadot returned to work on the Netflix action comedy Red Notice, posting a photo showing her getting tested for COVID-19 before going back on set 

Meanwhile, Gadot has returned to work shooting the Netflix film Red Notice with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Ryan Reynolds.

She shared a snap to social media earlier this month which shows her getting tested for COVID-19 as part of the production's pandemic protocols.   

'Getting ready to head back to the Red Notice set but prep looks a little different now..,' she wrote, adding the hashtag '#staysafe.'

In the action comedy, the former beauty queen stars as 'the world's greatest art thief'.

Johnson is an agent for Interpol while Reynolds is described as 'the world's greatest conman.' 

Production was halted in March as the result of the coronavirus outbreak. 

The pandemic also continues to delay the release of Gadot's highly anticipated sequel Wonder Woman 1984. 

The movie has now been scheduled for a December release, a full year after its originally scheduled premiere.

The actress reprises her role as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince opposite Chris Pine as  Steve Trevor. Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig round out the cast as the film's villains, Maxwell Lord and Cheetah.
