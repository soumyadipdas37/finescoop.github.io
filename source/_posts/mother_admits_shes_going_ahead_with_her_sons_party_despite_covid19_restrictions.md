A woman who arranged for ten of her closest friends to attend her son's first birthday party has been blasted for planning to go ahead despite the government's restrictions on gatherings of more than six people.

Posting anonymously on UK forum Mumsnet, the woman explained she feels bitter about how COVID-19 rules have impacted her life over the past few months.

She said having seen others flout the rules while she sticks to them makes her want to go ahead with her son's birthday party, despite Boris Johnson's recent announcement. 

The Prime Minister has put in place fines of up to £3,200 on gatherings of more than six people both indoors and outdoors from Monday. 

Responses to the post were divided as many argued the importance of following guidelines and said her son isn't old enough to remember his birthday party, while others admitted they understand her perspective. 

A British woman has sparked a discussion about the government's latest COVID-19 regulations, as she admits to planning to flout the rules for her son's birthday party (file image) 

The woman told Mumsnet she has stuck to the government guidelines over the past few months, while witnessing others do as they please 

Venting her frustration, the mother wrote: 'Son is one at the end of September, we have arranged a small birthday party at our house with around ten of our closest family and friends.

'I feel so bitter about how much COVID-19 has taken and the reality it may ruin my son's first birthday too. I am really thinking to just go ahead anyway? 

'After all the people I have seen flouting the rules for months it angers me. We have stuck to it tooth and nail and still my baby won't get a first birthday party.'

A stream of responses accused the mother of being 'selfish' and argued her son is too young to care about the cancelled celebration.

One person wrote: 'He's a baby. He doesn't know or care it's his birthday. This really must be the most selfish thing I've heard in relation to flouting the rules. I hope you get fined.' 







A flood of responses dubbed the mother 'selfish' and argued her son is too young to be disappointed about not celebrating his birthday

 

Another said: 'Lots of people are making bigger sacrifices at the moment to follow the rules and keep people safe. Your son's birthday can still be special without having all the family there as you originally planned. I understand your frustration but YABU.' 

A third added: 'I get you're disappointed, but DS will neither know nor care. If it was inside, it was against the guidelines before last night (just not the law), so you shouldn't have arranged it anyway. Why not just have two get together, split the invites in half. Twice the fun!'

Others confessed they wouldn't 'blame' the mother if she chooses to go ahead with the party, admitting they're also frustrated by the regulations.

'Have the party, I would. Ten people or six, doesn't make that much difference really,' one wrote. 







Others said they wouldn't blame the mother if she chooses to go ahead with the party, admitting they're also feeling frustrated by the guidelines 

Another said: 'Well I wouldn't blame you if you continue. What's an extra four people, when you could literally go and mingle with dozens more in a restaurant or shop. If you do do go ahead I hope you enjoy.'

A third added: 'Yes it would be wrong but the rules are stupid. You can only meet with six others but at the same time you must go to work and school with 100s of others. 

'So on that basis I would say go ahead if it's what you want and your guests are happy.'
