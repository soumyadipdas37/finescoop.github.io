Catherine O'Hara has reminded fans why they love her, while connecting to a whole new generation, starring on Schitt's Creek since 2015.

And the Canadian comedic legend's dedication to her character Moira Rose paid off at this year's 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

She dazzled in black sequins Sunday, as she accepted the first award of the evening, taking home Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of the eccentric matriarch.

The 66-year-old put on a stunning display in a black floor-length gown with spaghetti strap, layered over a matching sequined long-sleeve number.

She broadcasted live with her co-stars, as they enjoyed a socially-distanced dinner, which appeared to be at the home of her onscreen husband and longtime collaborator Eugene Levy, 73.

Catherine hugged Eugene and his son Dan Levy, 37, who created and stars alongside them in the beloved comedy series.

She said: 'How cool is it that Eugene has a microphone in his bedroom? This is so cool. Thank you, members of the Television Academy, for nominating me alongside these very cool women, and for topping off this fun evening with this trophy treat. 

Family gathering: The 66-year-old broadcasted live with her co-stars, as they enjoyed a socially-distanced dinner, which appeared to be at the home of her onscreen husband and longtime collaborator Eugene Levy, 73

Favorite role: She said in her speech: 'I will forever be grateful to Eugene and Daniel Levy for bestowing upon me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to fully be her ridiculous self'

Previously nominated: Catherine was previously nominated in the same category for her role on Schitt's Creek at last year's awards show (pictured in September, 2019)

'I will forever be grateful to Eugene and Daniel Levy for bestowing upon me the opportunity to play a woman of a certain age, my age, who gets to fully be her ridiculous self. 

'They gathered the most beautiful, fun-loving people in Toronto, cast and crew, and then by example, led us all to be the best we could be for each other.'

The Beetlejuice star made sure to give a special thanks to her glam team, before concluding: 'May I please wish you all a sound mind and a sound body? 

'And though these are the strangest of days, may you have as much joy being holed up in a room or two with your family as I had with my dear Roses. Thank you so much.'

She beat out Christina Applegate, Rachel Brosnahan, Linda Cardellini, Issa Rae and Tracee Ellis Ross for the coveted gold statue.

Bittersweet farewell: Their beloved sitcom, which aired its sixth and final season earlier this year, racked up this year with 13 nominations, winning nine, including Outstanding Comedy Series

This marks her first Primetime Emmy win since 1982, when she landed her first nomination and first win for writing alongside Eugene and other comedy greats on the Canadian sketch comedy show SCTV Network.  

Catherine was previously nominated in the same category for her role on Schitt's Creek at last year's awards show.

Their beloved sitcom, which aired its sixth and final season earlier this year, racked up this year with 13 nominations, winning nine (two were awarded before the show), including Outstanding Comedy Series. 

The cast has been visited by award presenters in black tuxedo-style hazmat gear, designed specially for the event.

For the first time in its 72-year history, this year's show was telecast from the homes of presenters, nominees and winners around the world, keeping with COVID-19 safety protocols. 

Host Jimmy Kimmel recorded live from a studio in Downtown Los Angeles, while producers sent more than 150 video kits to other talent, for them to record from home.
