A two-year-old boy is in a critical condition after nearly drowning at his family home in Maraylya, in Sydney's northwest.  

It is understood the boy fell into a private dam on the property on Pebbly Hill Rd about 10.30am Thursday.

Paramedics performed CPR on the boy after a Careflight helicopter arrived to the scene.

The toddler was in cardiac arrest and unresponsive when paramedics arrived 

The toddler has been taken to The Children's Hospital at Westmead in a critical condition. 

NSW Ambulance Acting Inspector Greg Marshall said the toddler was in cardiac arrest and unresponsive when paramedics arrived.   

'This is a parent's worst nightmare, arriving at a scene like this is heartbreaking,' he said. 

'It was an incredibly tragic scene we were faced with today. Paramedics and emergency services performed life-saving treatment before transporting our patient to hospital.'

'As we become more active in and around water during the summer months, it is imperative that everyone remains vigilant in and around the water - It only takes a moment for anyone to get themselves into trouble.'

An average of 30 children under the age of five have drowned in Australia each year for the past decade.
