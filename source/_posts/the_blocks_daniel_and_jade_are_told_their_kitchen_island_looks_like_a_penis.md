The Block's Daniel and Jade suffered an embarrassing gaffe on Wednesday, after they were told their kitchen island looked like a penis.

The unassuming South Australian couple were showing their design to their real estate agent, David Wood, who urged them to reconsider their layout.   

'The kitchen's the heart of the home, and if you don't get it right, it's just not going to work,' admitted Jade, 34.

After sitting down to design the kitchen's island bench, Jade said she wanted something that was 'going to draw their attention and their eye' to it.

Describing the curved end as 'an interesting piece to the island', the hairdresser seemed confident in her unique design.

But after showing their real estate agent the 'unusual' design, he seemed less enthusiastic about it.

'It looked like a penis at the end to me,' he said matter-of-fact after reviewing Daniel and Jade's plans.

After Daniel, 35, admitted that David was 'a little bit concerned', they decided to change their design at the last minute.

'Ah, a bench like that with stools around it, I've never seen it work well. And I'm sorry,' David told them diplomatically.

David then suggested they revert back to the architect's original layout for the kitchen.

Taking his feedback onboard, Daniel and Jade frantically called the company creating their kitchen and asked to change the design.

'We want to sell our house. We don't want it to sit here empty. We want it to sell on auction day. We want it gone,' said Jade.
