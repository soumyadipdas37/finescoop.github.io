Jade Thirlwall did a hilarious impersonation of Louis Walsh on the debut episode of Little Mix: The Search.

The singer joined her bandmates Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Perrie Edwards, in their search for the UK's next big bands. 

One of the first to audition was Emilia Clarke's Game of Thrones body double Rosie Mac who impressed the group with her rendition of Alessia Cara’s Scars to Your Beautiful.

The ladies were all blown away by Rosie's performance, with Jade saying: 'I just think you're the whole package really. 

She then put on her best Irish accent and did an impersonation of The X Factor's Louis Walsh and said: 'You look like a star, you sound like a star, you are a star,' referencing the phrase Louis has frequently told contestants he likes on the show. 

Her fellow bandmates burst into laughter, with Leigh-Anne saying: 'I knew you were going to say that!'

Perrie Edwards then did her own impersonation of Louis, saying: 'You look like a pop star! You sound like a pop star!'

After receiving four yeses, Rosie then went through to the next round with fellow singer Melina, where they joined Luke and Jordan to form a mixed group. 

In her audition tape, Rosie told how her love for music started from a young age.

She said: 'I’ve been an absolute show off since I was born... I was dancing before I could walk I was on the side of the sofa jamming to every song that came on. I just love music.'

She later channelled her onscreen alter-ego Daenerys Targaryen as she spoke a little Dothraki - the fictional language spoken on the HBO series.

Hilarious: Her fellow bandmates burst into laughter, with Leigh-Anne saying: 'I knew you were going to say that!' 

Fun: Perrie Edwards then did her own impersonation of Louis, saying: 'You look like a pop star! You sound like a pop star!' 

Rosie explained: 'That basically means, "I’m always going to protect you, Daenerys", before later stating: 'Being on set, riding the dragon, one of the best experiences of my life – I’m lucky!'

Meanwhile, Little Mix fans were left delighted on Saturday night after the girl group's new TV show launched, which saw the girls on the hunt for a boyband and auditioning hopeful potentials.

However as well as loving the performances, many viewers praised the programme for being 'much more personal than other talent shows' adding the band's individual personalities made it all the better.

Fans were dazzled by the show, which was pre-recorded before the COVID-19 lockdown, with dozens praising Little Mix for adding their own twist on the already established talent TV genre.

On the show, Little Mix are looking to form six bands, a boy band, a girl vocal group, a girl dance group, a mixed group, vocal and instrumental and R&B and rap. 

Success: After receiving four yeses, Rosie then went through to the next round with fellow singer Melina, where they joined Luke and Jordan to form a mixed group
