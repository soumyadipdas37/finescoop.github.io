She's been lapping up the sunshine in Greece after coronavirus lockdown restrictions eased.

And Leigh-Anne Pinnock kept the good times rolling as she continued to holiday on the island and documented her trip on Instagram on Monday.  

The Little Mix star, 28, commanded attention in a sensational outfit as she posed up a storm by a pool at five-star accommodation Loyal Villas Luxury.

Showcasing her toned figure, the musician stunned in a white bikini, teamed with a sheer white beach dress.

The singer wore her tresses in its naturally curly state, while going make-up free to highlight her stunning complexion.

The media personality captioned the image: '"When they tell you you can't, turn around and say watch me" @loyalvillasluxury @sportsworldmagazine.' (sic)

Good times: Lockdown was well and truly behind Leigh-Anne as she enjoyed a boat trip earlier in the week

Earlier in the week, the newly engaged beauty gave fans a glimpse of her peachy bottom while modelling a baby pink bikini from her very own  In'A’SeaShell range of swimwear.  

The fiancée of footballer Andre Gray showed off her toned body as she posed in the bold two-piece during a boat trip across the Aegean Sea. 

Leaning against the railings, Leigh-Anne commanded attention as she gazed out at the sweeping Greek coastline while showcasing her new design.  

Captioning the shots, she wrote: 'Happy Place.'

The British star has wasted no time in racking up the post-lockdown air-miles having recently returned from a trip to Ibiza. 

Leigh-Anne travelled to the Balearic party island for a close friend's hen-do before flying back to the UK for a two week quarantine ahead of her romantic Greek getaway. 

The singer accepted Watford striker Andre's marriage proposal during lockdown, and she recently admitted she's been planning her nuptials since she was 'a baby' and doesn't want a long engagement.

Flying high: The British star has wasted no time in racking up the post-lockdown air-miles having recently returned from a trip to Ibiza 

Speaking during an appearance on The Official Big Top 40 on Capital and Heart, she said: 'So I've been planning it since I was a baby, if I'm honest.

'I know what I want, and I don't really want a long engagement so I feel like I'm just on this you know? I'm on it.'

Host Will Manning asked: 'So are you being good about it or are you being a bridezilla?'

Leigh-Anne responded: 'Bridezilla, it's bad.'
