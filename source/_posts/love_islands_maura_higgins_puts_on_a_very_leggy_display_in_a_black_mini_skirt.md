Maura's outing comes shortly after her ex Curtis enjoyed a night out with his former Love Island flame Amy Hart, 28, last weekend.

The blonde beauty cosied up to Curtis, 24, in a sweet snap captioned: 'Nostalgia babes x', five months after his split from Maura. 

Curtis also posted a snap of the pair, captioned: 'Good to see you x @amyhartxo.'

In the wake of the reunion Amy has now re-followed her ex Curtis on Instagram.

Curtis, a professional ballroom dancer with a talent for tango, left Amy devastated after he started to chase after single Islander Jourdan Riane while Amy was away in Casa Amor.

Former air-stewardess Amy then told producers she wanted to leave the August series, after her 'half-boyfriend' split with her and began to chase after Islander Maura.

Maura split from the professional dancer in March just eight months after leaving the Love Island villa when speculation surfaced that he was getting overly friendly with dancer Amber Pierson, 21.

Amber and Curtis have since confirmed their romance when they were seen passionately kissing earlier this month.

Speaking to The Sun's Fabulous, she said: 'Everything happens for a reason and, to be honest, I wish him all the best.

'I'm in a good place now. It’s not nice to see, but I’m fine. It’s kind of a kick in the teeth that I’ve been cheated on by my last two boyfriends, but I will be stronger for this.'

The Irish beauty explained that their relationship began to crumble hours after her first performance on Dancing on Ice when Curtis was pictured in a clinch with a girl at a New Year’s party.

Reflecting on that time, she wished she had tackled the allegations head-on but was so focused on her first skate that she 'didn't want to make it an issue'.

She added: 'I tried to brush it aside and maybe it was the worst thing that I could have done. If I hadn’t, I probably wouldn’t have performed my first live show as well as I did but, looking back, in my gut I knew that there was something.'

Maura's comments come after Curtis was pictured putting on a very cosy display with Amber, who he previously denied cheating on Maura with, earlier this month.

The Love Island star and dancer walked arm-in-arm and stopped to share a kiss as the enjoyed an evening stroll.

After the images were revealed, a source close to Curtis' ex told MailOnline that it was a 'massive kick in the teeth'.

At the time of their split, friends of the former couple insisted that Curtis did not cheat on Maura with Amber.
