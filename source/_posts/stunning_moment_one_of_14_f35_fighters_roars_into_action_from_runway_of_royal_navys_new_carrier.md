Stunning footage has revealed F-35 stealth fighters roaring off the colossal flight deck of the Royal Navy's new flagship aircraft carrier the HMS Queen Elizabeth.

Two squadrons of F-35B Lightning stealth fighters, of the RAF Dambusters and the US Marines Wake Island Avengers, have joined Big Lizzie for drills with allies in the North Sea.

The 65,000-tonne carrier left Portsmouth earlier this week and is taking part in its final training exercises before it is declared ready for war.

It will later be joined by a strike group including seven Royal Navy destroyers, which the commander says will put 'real muscle back into Nato'.

Jets from the RAF's famed 617 Squadron (The Dambusters) have been joined by allies from the US Marine Corps aboard the ship. It is the largest number of warplanes ever on the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth.

It is the largest number of warplanes ever on the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth.

In total, 14 jets and eight Merlin helicopters are operating on board, the largest concentration of fighter jets to operate at sea from a Royal Navy carrier for nearly 40 years.

In this month's group exercise, HMS Queen Elizabeth will be joined by seven Royal Navy destroyers, frigates and auxiliaries, plus other supporting units, to form a fully sovereign Carrier Strike Group.

The group will be put through its paces off the north east coast of Scotland as part of Joint Warrior, Nato's largest annual exercise.

Commodore Steve Moorhouse, commander UK Carrier Strike Group, said: 'The United Kingdom's maritime renaissance has been unfolding over many years, as we introduced a new generation of ships, submarines and aircraft into service.

'But this marks the first time we have brought them together in a cohesive, potent fighting force.

This month's Group Exercise (GROUPEX) will see HMS Queen Elizabeth joined by warships from the UK, US and the Netherlands, which will accompany HMS Queen Elizabeth on her first global deployment in 2121. However before then, the newly formed Carrier Strike Group will be put through its paces off the North East coast of Scotland as part of Joint Warrior, NATO's largest annual exercise.

'HMS Queen Elizabeth will be operating with the largest air group of fifth-generation fighters assembled anywhere in the world.

'Led by the Royal Navy, and backed by our closest allies, this new Carrier Strike Group puts real muscle back into Nato and sends a clear signal that the United Kingdom takes its global role seriously.'

Commanding officer of 617 Squadron, Royal Navy Commander Mark Sparrow, said: 'This is an incredibly exciting time for 617 Squadron as we begin a new era of partnership with the US Marine Corps building towards next year's operational deployment with HMS Queen Elizabeth.

'You need to go back more than three decades to find the UK operating anything on this scale or complexity and this is a first for fifth-generation carrier capability.

'The era of big deck, fast jet carrier operations is back.'

HMS Queen Elizabeth, along with her 1,680 sailors, aviators and marines, is due to return to her home port of Portsmouth next month.

At 280 metres long, with a lifespan of half a century and a flight deck of four acres, HMS Queen Elizabeth is Britain's largest and most powerful warship ever built.

Here are the facts and figures behind the vessel which was officially commissioned into the Royal Navy December 7, 2017
