Jenna Dewan is still smitten with her fiance Steve Kazee. 

The couple who celebrated seven months of being engaged yesterday seemed to be going from strength to strength as the Flirty Dancing star took to Instagram to spill her heart. 

The 39-year-old brunette beauty could not help to gush over her main man as she reflected on the time they have spent growing together, especially since the birth of their newborn son, Callum, during quarantine.

 In the cute snap the pair are seen in casual attire as they cuddled up for the camera. 

Jenna, clad in denim overalls and a grey tank top, took the liberty of snapping the photo as she sat on Steve's lap. 

The 44-year-old Tony award winning actor let his Kentucky roots show as he sported a suede cowboy hat and a pair of jeans. 

He cradled his fiance as the two looked blissfully into the camera as Jenna jokingly revealed that she did not realize the filter said 'stay home' until after they snapped the shot. 

'We’ve been home together now every single day for over 400 days and still going...This man is the most incredible father, takes care of all of us, this entire house, EVERYTHING' she beamed. 

Partners: Jenna and Steve first got together in October 2018. The pair announced their pregnancy in November 2019 before the pair got engaged formally in February 2020; pictured October 2019 

 Jenna who shares her daughter, seven-year-old Everly, seven, with ex Channing Tatum is not a first time mother, though her fiance Steve is to Callum, as she continued to talk about him as a father figure. 

 'He is on his third night of taking the night shift with Callum so i can get rest. He is sexy fatherhood personified.'  

She continued to sing her man's praises saying, 'What a wild ride this past year has been and i find myself feeling absolute gratitude we’ve been given this time together, to laugh, to work through all the inevitable triggers of quarantine + newborn, and to still want nothing more than to sit on your lap and love you hard'

Her loving fiance was quick to comment on the sweet snap, 'Here’s to 4,000,000,000,000,000 more together.' 

'Sexy fatherhood': In her sweet message to her partner, Jenna could not help but gush over the amazing job Steve has done as a first time father to their newborn son especially as a dad in quarantine

 Jenna and Steve first started dating in October 2018 just a few months after she and ex-husband Channing split after nine years of marriage. 

The two were inseparable and eventually announced the birth of their first child together the following year in November of 2019.

Five months later the lovers were engaged in February, while Jenna gave birth to their son Callum in March, a week before the world was forced into lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic. 

Since lockdown the two have continued to find the balance between parenthood and self-care as their wedding plans have also been put on hold. 

Once: Jenna first met Steve when she saw him perform in his Tony Award winning role in Once on Broadway in 2012. The singer though with Tatum at the time met him backstage, and once she was single he reached out; Pictured in September 2019

 Back in August Jenna spoke to People magazine about the challenges she was facing dealing with a newborn in an unprecedented time. 

'I had to remember that I needed to look after myself too, during this whole process' she said as she cited yoga and pilates as well as any sort of daily movement as her sanity. 

The Gracefully You, 'it's been an incredible family bonding time for all of us. We’ve been in the house without anything else distracting us, so that’s been a blessing.'
