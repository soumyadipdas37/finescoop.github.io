Israel Adesanya proved beyond doubt that he is the man to beat at middleweight, but the popular fighter's antics in the aftermath of his UFC 253 win are likely to have not sat well with some fans.

The 31-year-old silenced his critics with a comprehensive win over rival Paulo Costa, a formerly undefeated Brazilian, and the pair had not seen eye to eye in the build up to their bout on Fight Island. 

The Brazilian threw a white belt in the direction of the champion at a face off during fight week, in an apparent jibe at Adesanya's jiu jitsu, which angered him to the extent that UFC president Dana White had to restrain the 'Last Stylebender' from attacking his rival.

And following his dominant second-round win over Costa, Adesanya made a series of lewd comments in the direction of his rival's corner.

But before that, the 31-year-old appeared to 'hump' his rival shortly after referee  Jason Herzog called a stop to the contest, and then strolled around the octagon, launching an angry tirade for everyone to hear.

'I wrap my d*** around my waist it's a black belt, motherf*****' he said, in reference to the white belt gimmick from Costa in the build-up to the title bout.

The champion then made his way to Costa's corner to chat with his trainers. The conversation appeared cordial, until Adesanya said 'Imma c** all over you'.

The 31-year-old then went onto breakdance while Costa was still receiving treatment from doctors just feet away.

It was a bizarre series of events following what was a world-class striking display from the champion, who is setting out to set a legacy of the kind forged by UFC icon Anderson Silva.

UFC president Dana White said that Adesanya has what it takes to be a UFC superstar

UFC chief White believes that Adesanya has what is required to be a UFC superstar. 

'I think he's gonna be the new Adesanya of the division,' White said.

'He's got his own style and his own way about him. I think he's gonna be the next big superstar here, especially after tonight's performance.'
