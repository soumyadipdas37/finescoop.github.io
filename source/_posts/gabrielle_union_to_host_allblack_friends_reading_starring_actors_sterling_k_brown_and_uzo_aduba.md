Gabrielle Union is hosting a reading of hit 1990s comedy Friends, reimagined with black actors.

The 47-year-old actress, who guest-appeared on an episode of the NBC show in 2001, will front the online event on Tuesday September 22 with Salli Richardson-Whitfield directing. 

The cast will consist of Sterling K. Brown, his wife Ryan Michelle Bathe, Uzo Aduba, Aisha Hinds, Kendrick Sampson and Jeremy Pope.

It's not known yet who will be playing which character from the iconic sitcom which followed the lives of New Yorkers Rachel Green, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and siblings Monica and Ross Geller.

The event is for a good cause, as Variety reports that the reading will spotlight When We All Vote, a non-partisan voter registration organization.

To watch the reading, fans need to RSVP on the mobilize.us website. 

The fun event kicks off at 6pm ET at Zoom Where It Happens.  

Meanwhile, during Sunday night's Primetime Emmy Awards three Friends stars proved their real-life bond has lasted through the decades.

Kerry Washington helped promote the event with this promotional snap of the stars of the NBC sitcom which ran from 1994 to 2004

Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow hung out to watch the ceremony and joked with Emmys host Jimmy Kimmel that they're still roommates after all this time. 

'Of course I'm here, we live together!' Cox, 56, teased as she appeared next to her Aniston.

Aniston, 51, joined in on the joke, adding, 'We’ve been roommates since 1994, Jimmy.' 

Kerry also shared a photoshopped version with the black cast in place of the original stars. The Zoom Where It Happens event will spotlight When We All Vote, a non-partisan voter registration organization

Delighting fans further, Kudrow then popped up, saying, 'Oh, is this live TV?'

HBO Max confirmed earlier this year that an official unscripted reunion special was in the works.

Aniston, Cox and Kudrow will reunite with Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc for the reunion more than 15 years after the series went off the air.

Unfortunately, production for the special has been delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
