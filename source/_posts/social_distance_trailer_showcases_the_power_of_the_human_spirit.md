The power of humanity, even in the midst of a global pandemic and lockdown, is put on display in the first trailer for Netflix's Social Distance.

The eight-part anthology series was filmed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which 'showcases the power of the human spirit in the face of uncertainty and isolation,' according to the official series description (via Netflix).

The show is comprised of eight standalone episodes which is 'told through a virtual lens and captures the unique emotional experience of being forced apart by circumstance' while relying entirely on technology to connect to anyone.
