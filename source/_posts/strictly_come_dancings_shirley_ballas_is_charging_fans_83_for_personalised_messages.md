Shirley Ballas is making personalised messages for her fans at a cost of £83 a video. 

The Strictly Come Dancing judge, who turned 60 on Sunday, is the latest star to join website Cameo and offer short clips which can be tailored to requests.

Speaking about her new gig, Shirley said she was 'very excited' to get going and couldn't wait to help fans with 'whatever they're going through'.

Shirley, who reportedly earns £350,000 for Strictly, was brimming with enthusiasm as she announced she had joined the site to treat her fans to personalised messages.

Speaking in an introductory video the dancer said: 'Hi everyone I’m Shirley Ballas and I’m so excited to join Cameo. 

'Through lockdown I had so many requests for messages that I actually missed a lot of them. 

'But I’m really really excited to get good messages out to you - birthday messages, wedding messages, whatever messages, uplifting messages - to help you through whatever you need help through. So I’m really excited.’

Shirley looked fantastic in the announcement clip, keeping things casual in an orange cardigan and patterned cream cap.

While a source told The Mirror: 'These sites are huge business and celebs are queuing up to get a piece of the action. It’s easy money for a few minutes’ work.'

Other famous faces who have started making video messages for their fans include soap star Catherine Tyldesley and Corrie's Bill Roache.

As well as making some extra cash on Cameo, Shirley also has her book Behind the Sequins coming out on October 1.

Announcement: Shirley shared the news on her Twitter account this week, saying 'bringing love and smiles to people is a beautiful thing'

The memoir will take fans from Shirley's childhood on an estate on the Wirral and leaving home at 14 years old to conquering the world of Ballroom dancing.

And despite all the excitement in her professional life, the star has managed to make time to celebrate her 60th birthday on Sunday. 

Shirley and her mum Audrey as well as her boyfriend Danny Taylor have been enjoying a luxurious stay at London's Shangri-La Hotel.

It comes after the star announced in July that she had a 'clean break' on her right foot, but assured Strictly fans she'll be fine to appear on the show when it returns.

Walking with the help of crutches and a medical boot, the choreographer had expressed her gratitude towards the NHS.

In a clip filmed by Danny, the media personality said: 'Hi everybody, I've just finished at A&E after a clean break, on my right ankle.

'We're not using Plaster of Paris anymore, using a boot, so I'm learning to walk on these crutches - crutches, right foot, close, a bit like the Waltz. Anyway, I'm going to be absolutely fine for Strictly.'

The TV star reiterated her comments in the post's caption, where she also thanked her actor beau for lending a helping hand after she sustained her injury. 

Shirley penned: 'So a clean break. Six weeks to heal. Thank you to NHS and all staff who took care of me.'

Last month, a source close to Shirley told The Mirror: 'She'll definitely be back on Strictly. No reason for her not to be as she doesn't need to dance to be on the panel but she will be out of the plaster by then. 

'The boot she had wasn't secure enough, so she has been put in plaster to make sure the bones heal correctly.' 

Meanwhile, the full line-up for this year's Strictly was announced this week, with the new shorter series kicking off in October.

Viewers will see the likes of EastEnders' Maisie Smith, actress Caroline Quentin, retired American football player Jason Bell, The Wanted's Max George and GMB's Ranvir Singh all battling it out for the Glitterball trophy.
