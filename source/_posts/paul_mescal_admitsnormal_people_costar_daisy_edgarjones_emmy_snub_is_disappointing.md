Paul also revealed that the first person he wanted to tell about his exciting Emmy nomination was his mother but he couldn't get in touch.

He added: 'I was trying to voice call everybody on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was picking up. 

'I think they were all kind of scared. When I got everybody on the call, it was pretty amazing. My brother who never cries was crying.'
