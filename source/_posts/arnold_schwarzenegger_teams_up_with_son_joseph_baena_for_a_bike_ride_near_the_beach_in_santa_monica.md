It is a perfect way to work out the body and mind and spend some quality time with family. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger hit the streets once again for his near-daily bicycle ride around the Santa Monica area of Los Angeles on Monday morning.

For this go-around the former California governor's son Joseph Baena was along for the ride, as the two eventually made their way just a block from the Pacific Ocean.

The Terminator star, 73, appeared to be enjoying his father-son bonding time dressed in grey shorts and a black IFBB Arnold Sports Festival jacket, which is among the promotional merchandise for the annual multi-sport event named after Schwarzenegger.    

He also donned brown slip-on shoes and dark sunglasses for their rendezvous that also took them through parts of Venice Beach and beyond.  

Schwarzenegger seemed to be setting the pace of the ride while Baena kept pace in black shorts, a black hoodie and black-and-white-checkered slip-on sneakers.

The 22-year-old also wore a black baseball cap and had a big beaming smile on his face during the portion of the ride near the beach.

The pair opted not to wear protective masks whenever they had a safe distance between themselves and others who were walking or riding along their route.

Baena has inherited his father's passion for exercise and bodybuilding. He often teams-up with his famous father for workouts at gyms in the Venice-Santa Monica region, which typically includes various weightlifting routines.

Baena often likes to showoff some of the flexing moves made famous by his dad during his world champion bodybuilder career that began back in the 1960s.

In fact, Schwarzenegger is still considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding.

Baena's mother, Mildred Baena, was the Schwarzenegger family's housekeeper when she had an affair with the legendary action star.
