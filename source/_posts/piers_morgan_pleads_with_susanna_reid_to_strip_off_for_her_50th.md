Gwyneth Paltrow caused a sensation on Monday by sharing a nude photo of herself to celebrate her 48th birthday.

And the 'Birthday suit' snap was the main topic of conversation for Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain. 

Piers, 55, was full of praise for the Hollywood star, gushing she looked 'sensational' before quipping that his co-star should consider stripping off for her own birthday.  

Wow! Gwyneth Paltrow's 'Birthday suit' snap was the main topic of conversation for Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain

'48 years old... I mean, she does look sensational, you have to admit. There's no other way of describing it,' Piers said as the image of Gwyneth flashed up on the screen. 

'Interesting decision to do that. I mean would you two [Charlotte Hawkins and Susanna] do that?' he then asked his two co-stars.

'No,' Susanna promptly replied, leaving Piers to ask her: 'Does that mean you'll be a year older than Gwyneth?'

'In nothing but my birthday suit today': Gwyneth shared a jaw-dropping snap of herself posing completely naked in a lush backyard as she celebrated her 48th birthday on Monday

'Yes I am and I'm going to be 50 in December,' Susanna replied, before jokingly adding: 'It did cross my mind - shall I do that for my 50th birthday!'

Piers was delighted, saying:'Yes! Yes! Susanna Reid birthday pic at 50. 

But Susanna pointed out: 'And then my mind went to how much embarrassment it would cause the children.'

'And Apple, who is Gwyneth's 16-year-old daughter, just put one word on the comments section - 'Mum'. You can just feel the weight of that 'Mum'.' 

Not gonna happen: Piers, 55, was full of praise for the star, gushing she looked 'sensational' before quipping that his co-star should consider stripping off for her own birthday.

In her caption, Gwyneth thanked everyone for their birthday wishes while also plugging her lifestyle brand Goop.

'In nothing but my birthday suit today... thank you all so much for the birthday wishes and thank you to @goop 's insanely amazing brand new body butter for making me think I can still get my kit off. #goopgenes' she captioned the snap. 

Gwyneth was definitely feeling the love from Instagram fans, if not her daughter Apple.

A slew of stars sent their well-wishes to Gwyneth including Demi Moore, Lea Michele and Courteney Cox. 

Mum! Susanna pointed out: 'It did cross my mind... and then my mind went to how much embarrassment it would cause the children'

Not cool, Mom! While Gwyneth's snap delighted countless fans, there was one Instagram user who was not amused - and that was her teenage daughter Apple Martin, 16
