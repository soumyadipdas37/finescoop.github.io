Just days after his new album Tickets To My Downfall was released, Machine Gun Kelly is opening up about his song Lonely, about his late father.

The 30-year-old rapper (real name Colson Baker) spoke about the new album during a Radio.com Live Check-In interview, as the rapper was driving. 

When asked about Lonely, which the interviewer described as, 'such a vulnerable song,' Baker revealed it was about his late father, who passed away on July 5.

'I think that song wrote itself as I was watching my father die in front of me,' he said in the interview.

'If you're a musician or a songwriter, I mean, you write about pain, so I don't know what bigger pain there is other than losing your last person you were taught you could count on,' he added. 

The singer continued that saying goodbye to his father 'that soon,' is still, 'really hard to talk about.'

'i had plans for the one year anniversary of Hotel Diablo today. that album was everything i wanted to say and i know it’s close to my fans... but my father took his last breath this morning, and ive never felt a pain this deep in my life. i’m setting my phone down. love you,' he added.

'I should’ve told him that I loved him years ago. breaks my f***in heart that we wasted all this time...' he concluded.

'I'd say sorry to my father. I have such a rule-abiding, amazing daughter and I was such a rule-breaking, s—ty so,' he said.

'The legal fees, the tens of thousands of dollars from the times I got arrested, the finding out your son missed a whole semester of high school because he was waking up and pretending to go but never going,' he added.

Baker's new album Tickets To My Downfall was released through Bad Boy and Interscope Records on September 25. 

Admitted: Baker also admitted in an interview with British GQ in July that he wished he could apologize to his father
