Celebrity spotting has been taken to a whole new level during the pandemic thanks to Deuxmoi, a viral Instagram handle all about Hollywood gossip.

The ultra-popular page is a crowd-sourced hub of celebrity spottings and detailed reports about how stars behave in person – from their coffee orders to fan interactions to their quirky preferences in the bedroom.

What makes the page even more tantalizing, the account is managed by an anonymous admin who gave DailyMailTV a rare look behind the curtain in an exclusive phone interview.

Spotted! The anonymous administrator behind the addictive celebrity gossip Instagram Deuxmoi gave DailyMailTV an exclusive peak into how the viral sensation works 

'It has to amuse me or else it gets boring,' the mysterious founder said of how she chooses her viral content.

A passing glance at Deuxmoi's Instagram Stories will tell a new follower everything they need to know about what the page is all about. Anonymous morsels of celebrity gossip are submitted to the account via direct message and then, with the permission of the sender, screen grabbed and shared. 

Some of the tid-bits are blind items – meaning the names of the celebrities they're about are omitted - and the admin is adamant about never revealing those names.

'There are certain salacious things I will post but I try not to cross the line,' she told DailyMailTV. 'Obviously, I don't know these people but it try to think about what they wouldn't want me to say based on what they put out there [themselves]. A lot of things I can't post.' 

Deuxmoi has carved out a clear niche for itself in the last few months and the account has kind of taken on a life of its own. The brand has gone through a major transformation since its launch in 2013.

It originally set out to be a lifestyle website run by two friends but sort of 'fizzled' out. The site was shuttered but the Instagram handle maintained, and then in the early stages of the pandemic everything changed.

How it works: Anonymous morsels of celebrity gossip are submitted to the account via direct message and then, with the permission of the sender, screen grabbed and shared; The antecdotes are completely unverified

'It just happened,' Deuxmoi's founder said about the brand's swift metamorphosis. 'I was going through what the rest of the country was going through at the same time. I was doing this to distract myself.'

In March, Deuxmoi posted a request on their Insta Story to crowd source celebrity gossip from a pool of about 45K followers. 

Buried in the responses was one particular nugget of (unverified) information about Leonardo DiCaprio, a pair of headphones and his preferences in the bedroom and, for Deuxmoi, the rest is history.

'I was living in NYC at the time and it was scary here,' she said. 'It made the days go by faster.' Adding that just like the IG's followers, 'It's a form as escapism for me too.'

Now, at over 232K followers and growing, the page is a favorite among celebrity obsessed, gossip hungry social media users and eagle eyed followers ready to dish their own tales about Hollywood.

'There are certain salacious things I will post but I try not to cross the line,' she told DailyMailTV. 'Obviously, I don't know these people but it try to think about what they wouldn't want me to say based on what they put out there [themselves]. A lot of things I can't post.'

The meteoric rise of the handle has been a surprise for the admin who made the decision early on to remain anonymous.

'There's a lot of different reasons,' she said of her choice to leave her identity shrouded in mystery. 'I do have a job. Nobody at work really knows that I do this and I don't want them to. It's almost like living two different lives.' 

'It's not really about me. I'm not an influencer, I'm really a vessel.' She added that she has thought about unmasking herself 'maybe in the future' if the page continues to grow.

These days there are so many tips that Deuxmoi does a sort of 'phone roulette' to randomly pick what will go up.' It's such a roll of the dice,' she said of deciding what to share. 'There kind of isn't really a rhyme or reason to it.' 

'It is really important to me to honor everyone who submits,' the social media mystery said. 'Without them it wouldn't have grown.'

Mostly what is being shared are real people's stories of their interactions with celebrities. For someone famous like a Chris Evans or an Emma Roberts (two names currently being featured on Deuxmoi), they meet thousands and thousands of fans but for each of those fans that could be a once-in-a-lifetime moment.

'I started to feel like a therapist who specialized in celebrity relations,' she joked. 

At first, the brand was only posting negative stories about celebrity interactions. The founder went that route to give everyday folks a place to say their piece. 

She explained that a negative 'two second run in' for a regular person with a celebrity who they admires or love can leave a fan feeling 'like sh*t.' 'I wanted to give them a voice.' 

For the most part, when it comes to the content, anything goes and the posts are comprised of rumors, anecdotes and conjecture. Nothing is vetted or verified, however, the admin does try to be 'sensitive about sensitive things.' 

Love it or hate it: when it comes to the page's haters she doesn't 'give a sh*t.' 'This isn't Instagram by jury,' she said. 'I'm not asking, right now, for anyone's opinion. I'm just running an IG for free. The main Instagram will always be a free open account.'

'I try to be fair and show both sides. The reason I do that is because I want people to form their own opinions.' As for why she doesn't verify what she's posting, the admin says she simply doesn't 'have time.'

'I'm not a reporter. I'm not claiming to be a reporter,' she said. 'It's a curation of information.' True or not, the stories range from the mundane (which the founder loves) to the more salacious. 

'Most of the A-listers are pretty nice,' she said. Adding that where celebs fall on the spectrum of naught and nice is nuanced and 'ever changing.' 

'I'm always getting new followers submitting new information. I was singing Luke Wilson's praises and then someone sent in a story about him at a bar and he had said something rude to her.' 

'Most of the A-listers are pretty nice,' she said. Adding that where celebs fall on the spectrum of naught and nice is nuanced and 'ever changing.'; Amy Adams is consistently on the nice list

The people have spoken: Anna Kendrick, Chris Noth (pictured), Owen Wilson, Jennifer Lopez, Lea Michele and Marissa Tomei are regularly dubbed by followers either difficult to work with or unpleasant to fans

At the end of the day, the creator knows that 'people are human' and bad interactions can happen to anyone. With that caveat, there are a few names that have pretty consistent stories.

Adam Sandler, Amy Adams, Drew Barrymore, Julianne Moore, Steve Carell, Pink and Hugh Jackman are constantly praised for being delightful to fans and great to work with. 

On the flip side, Anna Kendrick, Chris Noth, Owen Wilson, Jennifer Lopez, Lea Michele and Marissa Tomei are regularly dubbed difficult to work with or unpleasant to fans. 

 And, while Deuxmoi's hundreds of thousands of followers clamor to read about these unfiltered moments with celebrities that are divorced from PR spin or the star's own carefully strategized and sanitized social media – not everyone thinks the account is a good thing.

'The feedback I personally get I would say is 90% positive but I know that there are certain groups other place on the internet who are negative,' the admin said. At the end of the day she says, when it comes to the page's haters she doesn't 'give a sh*t.'

'This isn't Instagram by jury,' she said. 'I'm not asking, right now, for anyone's opinion. I'm just running an IG for free. The main Instagram will always be a free open account.'
