A group of Black Lives Matter protesters blockaded the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan on Saturday night, closing off traffic for around 10 minutes before marching to a police precinct and clashing with NYPD. 

Hawk Newsome, leader of the Greater New York chapter of BLM, said three people had been arrested following a violent confrontation outside an upper Manhattan police precinct.

He boasted: 'Say Less. Work More. THEY NEVER SHUT DOWN THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE BEFORE. 

'We did that for our Sisters and Brothers who had their lives stolen by AmeriKKKa.'
