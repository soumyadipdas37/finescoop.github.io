Charlotte revealed earlier this month that she was expecting her first child with boyfriend Matthew Sarsfield.

The reality star revealed she's 'over the moon' to be expecting a baby with the rugby league player, 28, and is due to give birth just a week before what would have been her late father Les Dawson's 90th birthday in February 2021. 

The comedian passed away from a heart attack aged just 62 when she was just eight-months-old. 

She told OK! magazine: 'We went for the first scan and my due date is actually the week before, but there's every chance I could give birth on his birthday. What a tribute that would be.'

She added: 'He would've been the best grandfather. It's bittersweet because he would have been here, making everyone laugh.'
