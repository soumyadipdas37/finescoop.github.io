A Canadian author and investigative journalist claims to have ‘new testimony from a bevy of women’ who allege they have been 'intimate with The Duke of York'. 

Ian Halperin is set to publish a series of books, 'Sex Lies and Dirty Money By The World's Powerful Elite' later this month. 

He claims the book will provide new information on Prince Andrew's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. 

A Canadian author is claiming to have the inside story on Prince Andrew's relationship with paedophile billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein 

Epstein killed himself in prison while awaiting charges on sex trafficking 

The author has listed the book on Amazon, which he claims will make 'world headlines'. 

According to The Sun, Halperin said: 'It's going to shed a lot of light.

'l'll say one thing after my book, if Prince Andrew is not finally interrogated by the Feds, we've got a major problem because I'm unleashing a ton (of) never before revealed stuff.

'About the Epstein case, about Maxwell, especially about Prince Andrew and about a plethora of other people connected to Epstein whose roles have never been revealed before.'

The Prince Andrew story is part of a six-volume book and later editions will concentrate on issues surrounding Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Megxit.  

Prince Andrew has continually denied all allegations of impropriety concerning his dealings with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein which have forced his stepping back from public life.
