Earlier this year, she admitted to resorting to dating on FaceTime after COVID-19 restrictions prevented her from meeting anyone in person.

And Jorgie Porter, 32, appeared to be making the most of her relative freedom to roam, when she was spotted enjoying a dinner date with hunky businessman Ollie Piotrowski, 31, in Manchester on Thursday night.

The actress, who is set to return to Hollyoaks for the show's 25th anniversary, looked sensational in a black minidress as she made her way into upscale eatery The Ivy.

She told new! magazine: 'I've had a FaceTime date. It's quite scary because you think we're just gonna sit face to dace and say, "Hello, how are you?"

'It's kind of awkward, so it's good to do a creative activity like paint a picture together, which is what we did. It's cool because you see how much effort they've put in.

'So if they get their paints and canvas ready, you're like, "Ah, he wants to impress me."' 

The unlucky-in-love actress previously dated Hollyoaks co-star James Atherton from 2011 to 2014, but admits she now relies on her friends to separate potential suitors from those who try and date her because she's a celebrity.

 She's also struggled to find a match online due to many people thinking her profile is fake, a similar response to the one experienced by Hollywood legend Sharon Stone, whose Bumble account was deleted amid claims it wasn't genuine.

'I got Sharon Stoned on Tinder. No one believed it was me,' she told The Sun. 'People were messaging me going, "There’s a fake of you on Tinder. But don’t worry, we’ve reported it and we’ve cancelled it". I was like, "No, it really is me".

'I didn’t get any dates and most of the people getting in touch were a bit catfishy, which was weird.' 

Despite resorting to the convoluted world of dating apps in a bid to find her Mr. Right, Jorgie insists she has no issue with being single. 

She added: 'I’m glad I’ve not settled down at a young age, married, got divorced and had to deal with the heartbreak.'
