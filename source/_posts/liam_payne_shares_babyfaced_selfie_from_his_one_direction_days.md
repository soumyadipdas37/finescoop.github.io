Finishing his look with a smart brown belt, Liam posed with a thumbs up in the mirror as he took the picture with his mobile. 

The singer, who first auditioned for the X-Factor in 2008 aged 14, was seen with his dark brown locks swept over his face in the sweet snap. 

And fans were in awe of the throwback picture and commented on how 'adorable' Liam looked.

A third penned: 'Baby Paynoooo.'

Earlier this week Liam spoke about his engagement to Maya, 20, on Good Morning America.

After being congratulated on his news, he said: 'We’re just really happy. I mean, in the last week, I’ve just had a birthday, my son has gone to school for the first time today, so it seems like a lot of firsts for me, really, actually, which is great.'  

Liam shares three-year-old son Bear with his former partner Cheryl, whom he split from in July 2018.

It was confirmed that the For You hitmaker had popped the question to Maya in August after the brunette beauty was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand after having dinner with Liam at Novikov Restaurant & Bar in London.

The couple were first spotted together back in August 2018, but didn't make their romance Instagram office until September 2019.

Liam has previously described Maya - who he initially met when she was a fan of One Direction - as his "best friend".

He said: 'I've found someone who's genuinely my best friend. She's just so relaxed about everything and someone who's completely got your back with everything is just the wildest thing.  

Love: Amid split rumours earlier this year, a friend explained they were taking their romance off social media, adding, 'Maya and Liam are definitely still a couple and are very happy together' 

'I don't think I've ever really experienced that before in someone so it's quite a wonder to watch actually.'

The singer has also insisted that Maya had helped him cope with his fame and had given him the confidence to be himself in public and simply relax and not worry about any attention he might receive.

He said: 'The difference is with [Maya], she’s so relaxed that it helps me relax in a situation, rather than being somewhere and talk about who is watching and what’s going on.

'People are going to watch whatever. What am I supposed to do? I can’t do anything about it now. It’s too late for that.' 

First meeting: Liam's most high profile romance was with singer Cheryl, who is 10 years his senior. They first crossed paths on the X Factor in 2008 when she was 24 and he was 14
