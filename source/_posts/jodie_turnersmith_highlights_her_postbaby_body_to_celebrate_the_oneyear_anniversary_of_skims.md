She showed off her stunning physique earlier this week in a set of photos to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims.

And Jodie Turner-Smith posted even more gorgeous photos from the campaign to her Instagram account on Sunday.

The 33-year-old model and actress showed off her post-pregnancy figure from multiple angles in the stylish mirror photoset.

Jodie included a short video with the post that featured her reclining on a round carpeted pedestal as she stretched out her arm and caressed her dark braids, which was soundtracked to a moody synthesizer score.

She was dressed in a cream-colored bra with matching high-waisted panties that revealed her slim midriff.

The 5ft9in Queen & Slim star had her in long black box braids, which she showed off in another snap as she gazed intently into her mirror images.

She completed the simple look with a pair of black stilettos.

Jodie changed into a one-piece brown bodysuit in another photo, which showed her standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling mirror.

This time, she wore her hair back in a single thick braid and had a golden mesh headdress over her crown.

'more [chocolate bar and brown heart emoji] for @skims 1 year anniversary,' she wrote in the caption. 

'virgo season coming in mega hot and i’m not just talking about the temperature #VirgoMood #ButAlso #ItIs114DegreesFahrenheit,' she wrote, with the final hashtags referring to the heat wave that has swept Los Angeles in the last two days and has ignited wildfires around the region.

The British beauty shared a less glamorous selfie to her Insta Stories on Sunday that showed her wearing a black lactation bra while she had a fuzzy gray robe tied around her waist and a black scarf wrapped over her head.

'Do lactation brownies count as breakfast food? Asking for a friend,' she joked in the caption.

She also wore a low-cut white dress and showed off her lovely sin, before panning a bit to reveal Joshua driving.

'Mum & Dad,' she captioned the clip, and the two looked as if they were heading out for a picnic with their four-month-old daughter Janie, whom Jodie gave birth to in April. 

A representative for the couple told People at the time: 'Both mother and baby are happy and healthy.' 

Days after the statement was released, Jodie announced the big news herself, gushing on Twitter that, 'i'm a mother!'

Last month, Jodie opened up about the stresses of raising a newborn.

She posted a short selfie video captioned, 'what is it about the sound of your baby crying that drains you of energy??'

The Neon Demon actress added, 'feel like i ran a marathon today — that delirious feeling of pride in your accomplishment and also like where is the nearest hole to crawl inside and sleep till next year?'  

Earlier this week Joshua affectionately posted a social media snapshot of his wife breastfeeding their firstborn child.

The acting couple were first linked in 2018. They were seen wearing wedding rings back in November, but it wasn't until December that they confirmed they had secretly wed.
