She rose to notoriety following her stint in ITV's The Only Way Is Essex.

And Chloe Ross continued to bask in the limelight as she posed up a storm while enjoying a night out with pals at a Greek restaurant in London on Thursday. 

The former TOWIE star, 27, oozed confidence as she rocked a denim blue playsuit, which allowed her to showcase her slender pins.

Chloe was all smiles as she posed for snaps in her stylish denim number which featured a tie belt which cinched her in nicely at the waist.

The reality star paired her playsuit with white trainers, while she carried her essentials in a taupe handbag.

The beauty swept her brunette tresses into a high ponytail, while she upped the glam with a sleek palette of make-up.

Chloe was clearly in a good mood as she pulled off a number of fun poses on her night out.

Chloe's former castmates have been filming the new series of ITVBe's The Only Way Is Essex, which celebrates the show's 10-year anniversary in recent weeks. 

The 10th anniversary series was due to start filming in March 2020, but ITV bosses made the tough decision to put the production on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fans were left without their Essex fix until the show came back with a vengeance on earlier this month with former cast member Amy Childs returning.

The new series has got off to a shaky start as TOWIE received 176 Ofcom complaints after viewers said they were left feeling 'uncomfortable' during Sunday's episode.

During the show, Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 25, were all accused of bullying 19-year-old Chloe Brockett.

The women started arguing when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex, Jack McDermott.

While the episode was airing many viewers took to Twitter to say express their concern about the trio's treatment of much younger cast mate Chloe B.

And now 176 people have lodged a complaint against the popular reality TV show since Sunday.

An Ofcom spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'

While a TOWIE spokesperson said: 'Only Way Is Essex follows the real lives of our cast and as such we see their celebrations, make ups, break ups and disagreements.

'What you see on screen is based on the thoughts and opinions they choose to raise as part of telling their story. We have a robust support system in place to ensure the cast are supported before, during and after filming.' 

Having their say: The row first occurred when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex boyfriend, Jack McDermott
