Olivia Munn was tending to her lush garden on Wednesday afternoon.

There were tomatoes and lettuce in the garden beds as Olivia looked down at them.

Munn looked slender in the skimpy triangle top that had spaghetti straps. Her long dark hair was worn down and she had on a dark cap.

Olivia seems to be in a gardening mood as last week she was seen tending to plants again, this time with Amanda Kloots and her child; Kloots has been in mourning after her husband Nick Cordero died from COVID-19. 

This summer the siren said she had such bad sex with a previous boyfriend, she thought he was gay.

The actress admitted her unnamed partner was 'the worst' in the bedroom and when she questioned him, his confession to a lack of experience led to her having further doubts.

Speaking to Whitney Cummings on the Good For You podcast, she said: 'I have this one boyfriend, in particular, that was just the worst, the worst at just having sex.

'In fact, he went down on me twice during the years we were together, and I asked him once and said, Why don't you ever go down? By the way, I don't want you to. But I'm just wondering why because I feel like most guys I can't get out of my vagina.

'And I'm like, You have to fake it all the time.'

Olivia recalled he said he didn't have a 'lot of experience doing it'.

She added: 'And that's when I was also like, "Um, he may like Benton [the show's male podcast producer] instead," you know? It might be his kind of game and stuff.'

And the Predator star's suspicions were further fueled by the fact her partner only liked to have sex in the dark and 'spooning from behind' so he didn't see her face.

She added: 'But also it was like every every time we had sex, every time: dark. Spooning from behind. Every time. It was a dark relationship. But also lights off, lights out.

'It was like, spooning from behind, so it's like you don't have to see my face, you have to see that it's a girl.'
