Luis Suarez has agreed to join Juventus from Barcelona and is nearing the exit door if he can finalise his payoff. 

The 33-year-old striker looks set to combine with Cristiano Ronaldo next season rather than Lionel Messi with his time at the Nou Camp coming to an end. 

According to Guillem Balague, Suarez is happy to be paid one season's wages by Barcelona to get him to move on and he has agreed to join the Italian side. 

Luis Suarez has reportedly agreed to join Juventus from Barcelona this summer 

The Uruguayan does not have to leave Barcelona and has one more year on his existing deal. 

If he played 60 per cent of the games next season he would trigger another year extension but it appears all parties are ready to move on. 

He will join Andrea Pirlo's side as either a free agent or for a small nominal transfer fee.  

Balague reports that the departure will have no impact on the decision Lionel Messi makes about his future at Barcelona. 

Suarez will be fondly remembered in Catalonia having delivered consistently for the team having joined from Liverpool for £74million six years ago.  

He scored a whopping 198 goals in 283 appearances, combining with Messi and for a time Neymar with devastating effect.  

Suarez was an integral part of the side that won the Champions League, LaLiga and Copa del Rey back in 2014-15.
