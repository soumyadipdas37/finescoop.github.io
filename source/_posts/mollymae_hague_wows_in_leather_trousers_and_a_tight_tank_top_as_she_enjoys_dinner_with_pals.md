However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.

As the complaints ramped up on the site, the reality star clapped back and wryly tweeted: '£10 to any boy that’s not tweeted ‘£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae’s giveaway’..... terms and conditions apply x.'

However, Molly-Mae later revealed on her Instagram Stories that the negative comments had hit a nerve. 

She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always.

'Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.'
