She recently vowed to drop a dress size after having some 'pounds creep back on' during the coronavirus lockdown.

And Kelly Brook put on a casual display as she stepped out with her beau Jeremy Parisi for an outing with their pet pooch in Hampstead, London, on Thursday.

The model, 40, opted for a simple look as she teamed a loose black shirt with form-fitting leggings that accentuated her slender legs.

Kelly complemented her look by wearing a pair of black trainers, while she added a glittering touch by accessorising with a silver pendant.

She pulled her brunette locks back into a tight ponytail and shielded her eyes with a pair of chic black shades. 

Jeremy, meanwhile, also opted for a casual look for their lunch as he paired a white t-shirt with light-wash denim jeans.

Kelly's appearance came after she vowed to slim down after admitting her weight 'crept back up' during national lockdown. 

The voluptuous host, who previously insisted she wasn't worried about weight gain, has pinpointed dress sizes 10-12 as her ultimate goal after embarking on a new diet. 

She is attempting to lose her lockdown weight by taking on the SlimFast challenge, with standard food portions replaced by two meal replacements, three 100-calorie snacks and one 500-calorie meal a day. 

Taking to social media for a Q&A on Tuesday, the model insisted she was determined to reach her target having dropped two dress sizes during a previous attempt at dieting in March, again with the SlimFast plan. 

Responding to a fan, she wrote: 'I went from a Dress Size 14/16 to a 10/12. I'm curvy so I notice weight loss more in my clothes than on a scale.

'My target now is to get to a size 10/12 again as during lockdown I had some pounds creep back on!' 

When asked how quickly it takes to see positive results, she added: 'Usually in my clothes after a week! After lockdown I really wanted to get back into my jeans and dresses so I always notice a change when they start feeling loose and less tight.'
