Helen shares her two daughters with fiancé Scott Sinclair, who she has been in a relationship with since 2009.

In June, the actress took to her Instagram to announce she will no longer edit her pictures as she wants to set a confident example for her girls.

Helen who admitted her postpartum photos left her 'self-conscious', backed up her pledge by posing in a lacy pink lingerie set for a series of un-retouched snaps. 

Helen, wrote on her Stories: 'My boobs have massively changed from pregnancies and nursing and has made me feel really self conscious the past year. My stomach has changed from my babies.'

Helen later detailed why she decided to take the brave step, penning: 'I've decided to stop editing my pictures to be a better role model to my daughters. Beautiful lingerie set @pourmoiltd.

'I've been lucky enough to carry two healthy babies and nurse them both for nearly two years. My skin on my stomach has changed, my boobs massively have (no creepy comments from any creepy men here this is a post about body confidence for other women, I will just delete and block). 

'The change in my boobs definitely has made me feel less confident in myself but I wouldn’t change a thing.

'I have cellulite, I don’t have a big bum I have edited it in the past as it’s something I am self conscious of. I’d look at other women on Instagram and put myself down for not looking like that'
