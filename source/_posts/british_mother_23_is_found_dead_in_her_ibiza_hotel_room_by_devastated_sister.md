A British mother has been found dead in her Ibiza hotel room by her devastated sister after dying in her sleep during a family trip. 

Amy Connor, 23, was staying at the Ibiza Rockets Hotel in the resort of San Antonio, where her body was found by her sibling, Toni, 26. 

The sisters, from Coleraine in Northern Ireland, had been sunbathing before going back to their room to rest on August 20. 

Amy Connor, 23, was staying at the Ibiza Rockets Hotel in the resort of San Antonio, where her body was found by her sibling, Toni, 26

Toni told Belfast Live: 'We had been down to the pool and then came back up to the room for a while, so Amy got into the shower and then got into bed.

'I went and sat out on the balcony and ate some crisps and chilled and when I came back in, she was still in the bed. 

'It was so surreal, it didn't make sense. It was just such a shock.'

Ms Connor's funeral takes place in Belfast today.
