Angelina Jolie is one of the most famous women in the world.

But the actress/activist/filmmaker looked like the average LA mom while taking some of her six kids to their local West Hollywood Target on Saturday.

The Oscar winner, 45, donned her usual uniform of all black during her shopping trip with Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and Vivienne, 12.

There were a few luxury touches to the celeb's outfit. She carried around a handsome Valentino purse while clad in nude slides that were also from the Italian fashion house. 

Exuding effortless glamour, she smoothed her brunette locks back into a low bun and topped things off with sophisticated wire-frame glasses. 

Everyone wore masks, according to current California-wide guidelines to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Jolie and ex Brad Pitt's youngest children are 12-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox. Their oldest, Maddox, is 19 and studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea.

Angelina and family's outing comes amid reports things are extremely tense between the star and her 56-year-old actor ex.

Relations between the former couple who share six children have deteriorated to the point where they are no longer engaging in family therapy ahead of a custody trial slated for next month, UsWeekly reported earlier this month.

'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place,' a source told Us Weekly. 

Pitt and Jolie had appeared to reach a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted leaving the actress' LA home in June after spending time with the children.

However, UsWeekly claims they are now at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.

Eldest child Maddox, 19, is allowed to choose his own timetable and is rumored to no longer have any contact with his father. 

'Brad wants 50/50 joint physical and legal custody of the kids. Angelina has been unagreeable to those terms,' a source told UsWeekly.

The insider added that Jolie 'will only agree to talk about an agreement if the home base for the children isn't Los Angeles. The younger kids are in school in Los Angeles, which Angelina has always been opposed to.'

It's previously been suggested that Jolie wants to relocate to the UK and base the children with her there.

DailyMail.com has reached out representatives for Pitt and Jolie seeking comment.
