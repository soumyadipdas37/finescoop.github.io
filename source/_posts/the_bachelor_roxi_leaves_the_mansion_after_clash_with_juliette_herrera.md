The Bachelor's Roxi Kenny made headlines following her explosive argument with intruder Kaitlyn Hoppe at last week's cocktail party.

And rumours are swirling that the 29-year-old's fiery temper prompted her departure from the show after she clashed with another co-star, Juliette Herrera.

Roxi apparently got into a confrontation with Juliette Herrera during filming at the Bachelor mansion - and things became so heated that she decided to leave.

A source told Daily Mail Australia that the pair's argument was 'full on'.

Their clash is believed to have happened in the early hours of the morning after the contestants reunited at the Bachelor mansion Oxford Falls, Sydney, following the COVID-19 shutdown.

On-site production of The Bachelor was suspended in March due to the escalating health crisis, and resumed in the first week of July.

'As soon as the girls reunited, Roxi and Juliette started arguing,' added the source. 

The insider went on to claim that producers were 'blindsided' by the hostility between the women and had to 'jump in'. 

It comes after New Idea reported that Juliette had been involved in a separate heated exchange with Maddy Carver during filming.

Maddy Carver apparently confronted Juliette after finding out that she had been telling everyone in the mansion she was 'fake' 

A source said of the 'ugly' spat: 'The girls were standing around in total shock. They couldn't believe what had just happened.' 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
