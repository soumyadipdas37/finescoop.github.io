Matthew Banta, 23, 'dropped into the fetal position and began crying' when he was busted by cops with a flamethrower on the way to a Black Lives Matter march in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Saturday 

An alleged Antifa agitator 'dropped into the fetal position and began crying' when he was busted by cops with a flamethrower on the way to a Black Lives Matter march. 

Matthew Banta, 23, was caught with the incendiary device in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Saturday night. He was also discovered in possession of 'military-grade 5-minute' smoke grenades, fireworks, and a various Antifa flags and stickers, according to The Green Bay Press-Gazette. 

A criminal complaint alleges that Banta 'is known to be a violent Antifa member' who goes by the nickname 'Commander Red'. 

The complaint goes on to assert that the youngster 'incites violence in otherwise relatively peaceful protests.'

Antifa is a far-left anti-facist movement comprised of different sub-groups, of all whom hold anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian views. 

Banta admitted he was on his way to the BLM rally moving through Green Bay's downtown area (pictured). President Trump has theorized that Antifa members are deliberately infiltrating protests to cause violence and civil unrest

President Trump has accused Antifa members of deliberately inciting violence at protests that have unfolded across the country in recent months. He claims the left-wing agitators often arrive from out of town in order to stir up violence and civil unrest at those events. 

Indeed, on Saturday, Banta was arrested more than 45 minutes from his home in Neenah, Wisconsin. 

Police were alerted to Banta and three other men after a witness called 911 claiming there  were 'a whole bunch of white people with sticks, baseball bats and helmets headed... towards the police'. 

WBay.com reports that one of the men was 'wearing a metal helmet with goggles and military-style gear with multiple pouches'.

Banta reportedly admitted to police he was headed toward the Black Lives Matter protest, but denied he was trying to stir up trouble. 

Fox 11 aired footage of the large march, with crowds seen moving through the city's downtown. 

However, 15 people were arrested at the BLM march after the rally 'took a turn and police ordered it unlawful'. 

Banta was taken into custody and charged with obstructing an officer and two counts of felony bail jumping. His bond has been set at $2,500. 

Earlier this month, he was arrested for 'pointing a loaded gun at a police officer' and 'biting and kicking an officer during a protest'.

He was charged for that offence with second-degree recklessly endangering safety and released on a $10,000 bond. 

Meanwhile, police officers in Green Bay are worried about the presence of Antifa members in their city. 

'It’s worrisome when people associated with Antifa come here to Green Bay from out of town for the purpose of protesting here or for the purposes of committing violent acts,” Green Bay Police Chief Andrew Smith told WBay.com. 

While community group Black Lives United-Green Bay (BLU) say they have no association with Banta, they did offer a statement to the publication. 

'BLU is not discouraged by the way folks are grieving...we are in this together. We don’t see rioting as taking away from our message because it actually reinforces the state of emergency that we are in,' they said. 

Police officers and politicians have a different view. 

“Burning buildings, hurting people, shooting, looting, vandalizing — there’s absolutely no way that is a form of protest,” Police Chief Smith told Fox 11. 

Meanwhile, Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden also disavowed violence on 'the left and the right', after pundits claimed he was not speaking out forcefully enough on the issue. 

Some Black Lives Matter rallies have turned violent in recent months. Saturday's protest in Green Bay (pictured)  ended with multiple arrests after the demonstration took a turn
