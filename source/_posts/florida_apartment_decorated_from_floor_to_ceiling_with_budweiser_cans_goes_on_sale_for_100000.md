An apartment with Budweiser cans covering nearly every room from floor to ceiling has gone on sale for $100,000.

The 815 sq ft property, in Lake Worth, Florida, has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, but a couple of Budweiser signs welcoming visitors outside the home give only the tiniest hint of what is inside. 

The home's former beer-loving owner, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran who died in June, spent 16 years plastering nearly every wall and ceiling with empty cans of the popular beer, with stunning photos demonstrating the neatness of their creation.

The living room, both bedrooms, kitchen and walk-in wardrobe are among the rooms seen with the red and white cans adorning the walls and ceiling, according to TODAY.

The only rooms free of any cans are both of the apartment's bathrooms. Also displayed in the flat is a host of classically American memorabilia, including Buffalo Bills and baseball posters.

Adams-Kearney, who owns the brokerage Kearney & Associates Realty, where the home is listed, said she has been in real estate for 15 years but had never encountered anything like the Budweiser apartment.  

'We've seen some things in our days because we've been through the short sale market and the foreclosure market but nothing like this,' she commented.

The agent said she first learned about the property when she was called by Kris Johnson, the representative for the estate of the owner, veteran Mike Amelotte, who had died in June.

In the pint-sized kitchen (pictured), the appliances including the oven and the fridge and the work surfaces are mercifully free from cans, but any new owner can still enjoy their presence on the walls

Outside the condo there is no sign of the incredible furnishing which is inside (pictured). Real estate agent Kristen Adams-Kearney told TODAY that she was 'blown away' upon her first visit to the apartment

Amelotte is said to have bought his home in 1986 and started collecting cans after drinking them. He then began the project to decorate his home in 1990, according to Kris Johnson, the representative for his estate. Pictured, the living room

The decoration has been done very neatly, demonstrating Amelotte's commitment to his beloved beer and home. Pictured, the walk-in wardrobe 

Adams-Kearney said she only realized that the home was adorned with actual cans when she walked in and discovered its unique feature. Pictured, the living room

The only rooms free of any cans are both of the apartment's bathrooms (pictured), although any new owner might be glad of the  fact

Since being listed, Adams-Kearney said the apartment has had multiple offers and is now under contract with potential new owners who did not see the home before putting in an offer

The property's other bathroom is also free from cans, although any new owner could add to the work if they so wished
