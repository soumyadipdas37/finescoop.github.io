Britons have been enjoying nights out across Britain over the Bank Holiday Weekend and paying no mind to social distancing rules.

Revellers were lining up outside of clubs in tightly-packed groups in Manchester - where coronavirus-related restrictions are being lifted next week.  

In Leeds, people were hugging and dancing together as buskers played music in the street.

In Soho, London, one reveller was pictured pushing another through the street on an office chair, while in Sheffield, a group of young men dressed up as medieval knights as they ventured out for the evening. 

Around four million people were ordered on July 30 not to mix with other households in Greater Manchester, the biggest city in northern England, parts of West Yorkshire and East Lancashire, though they could still go to the pub and to work.

Lockdown restrictions will be lifted in parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire, where coronavirus cases have decreased.

From next week, more than one million people can meet family and friends from different households, with social distancing, for the first time in more than a month.
