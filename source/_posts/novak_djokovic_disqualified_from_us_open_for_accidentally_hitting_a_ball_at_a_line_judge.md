Novak Djokovic has been disqualified from the US Open for accidentally hitting a ball at a line judge in his round of 16 tie against Pablo Carreno Busta.

The World No1 was about to change ends after a game and then he hit the ball towards a line judge without looking and hit the girl in the face.   

The Serbian was serving well and playing great tennis and finally pounced on Busta's serve to generate triple set point at 5-4, 0-40.

But Djokovic failed to convert three set points and lost six points in a row and then fell onto his shoulder at 5-5, 0-15. 

The mutliple grand-slam champion then called the trainer on and after resuming lost his service game.

Djokovic was then frustrated and fired a ball behind which struck the lineswoman in the throat.

The lineswoman yelled out and fell to teh ground and then was helped by umpire Aurelie Tourte and Djokovic.

After a 10-minute discussion with Carreno Busta sitting quickly on his bench, Djokovic was defaulted and kicked out of the tournament.

This means on the men's side of the US Open, there is no grand slam winner left in the tournament and Djokovic was heavy favourite to win the American tournament again this year.

The last Slam without at least one of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic in the semi-finals was Roland Garros 2004.

Federer is out injured and Nadal did not want to compete amid safety concerns surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.
