She became the first star voted off Celebrity Karaoke Club... despite being a professional singer.

Yet Tallia Storm still seemed to be in high spirits as she enjoyed a night out in London on Wednesday. 

Dressed to impress for the occasion, the 21-year-old Scottish beauty ensured all eyes would remain firmly on her.

Tallia poured her curves into a skintight pink corset dress with a low-cut neckline that showcased her cleavage. 

She teamed the garment with a pair of thigh high silver boots and a fringed glitterball clutch bag. 

Her trademark curly blonde locks were worn swept back in a ponytail, allowing a look at her gold hooped earrings.  

Think pink! Dressed to impress for the occasion, the 21-year-old Scottish beauty ensured all eyes would remain firmly on her

Tallia's night out coincided with the launch of Celebrity Karaoke Club, which sees a bunch of stars hoping to impress each other with their vocals and stay in the competition.  

In between the rounds the stars can either grab a cocktail at the bar or gossip about their rivals in the toilets.

The celebrities have to form alliances with their fellow competitors in the hope their popularity will propel them to victory.

Sadly, Tallia's time on the show came to an abrupt end, when she became the first celebrity booted off.  

The competition is a tough one as some of the stars have extensive backgrounds in the musical world while others are total vocal novices. 

In 2012, Jess Wright signed a three-single deal with record label All Around the World and went to Marbella to film the music video for her debut single Dance All Night.

Diana Vickers meanwhile found fame as a competitor on The X Factor in 2008 and was a runner-up on the show - in a nod to her vocal abilities.

Other stars on the show include comedian and Loose Women favourite Judi Love, comedian and TV host Joel Dommett, drag queen and entertainer Courtney Act, TV and radio presenter Roman Kemp and Ibiza Weekender's David Potts.

TV and radio presenter Melvin Odoom, comedian and impressionist Luke Kempner, Drag Race's Baga Chipz, Gogglebox's Scarlett Moffatt and Love Island's Samira Mighty are also in the star-studded line-up.
