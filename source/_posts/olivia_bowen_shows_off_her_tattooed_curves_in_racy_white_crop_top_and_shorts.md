She's been hitting the town with pals and husband Alex Bowen recently to celebrate her wedding anniversary.

Olivia flaunted her tanned and tattooed figure in the white crop top and matching hot pants.

She added a glam touch of makeup, including a ruby red lip colour as she showed off every angle of her racy look. 

'Pj’s or out that is the question? Cutteee,' she teased in the Instagram caption.    

Olivia has been celebrating two years of marriage with husband Alex recently, with the pair dining at London's Scott's last Tuesday and STK the following evening.

The lovebirds also pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.

Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together. 

The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance. 

When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.

Out! After musing whether to stay in in her pjs, Olivia decided to glam up to hit London for a dinner and night out with her friends

'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.

'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.

'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.' 

Celebration: She's spent the past several days celebrating her two-year wedding anniversary with her husband Alex Bowen. Pictured together on Love Island back in 2016
