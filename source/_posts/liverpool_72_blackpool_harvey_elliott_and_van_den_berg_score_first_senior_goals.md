Liverpool turned on the style to finish their pre-season in ruthless style with a nine-goal thriller against Neil Critchley's Blackpool.

Jurgen Klopp's side arranged the match against their former coach's side, to have a final run-out before the return of Premier League action.

And, despite going two goals down and having several big names missing due to international duty, the Reds surged into life to pull off a demolition comeback.

Harvey Elliott took his chance to impress for Liverpool by grabbing his first senior goal

The youngster was congratulated by veteran James Milner, who captained Liverpool at Anfield

Sepp Van den Berg put icing on the cake, scoring Liverpool's seventh and his first senior goal

An early Blackpool goal was gifted courtesy of youngster Billy Koumetio, whose error allowed CJ Hamilton to capitalise and score.

A penalty soon after was duly converted by Jerry Yates, before Liverpool quickly jolted into life with Klopp bellowing from the touchline. 

Returning defender Joel Matip handed his side a boost after converting on the cusp of half time, before words of wisdom at the interval clearly resonated with the Liverpool players.

Returning defender Joel Matip got Liverpool off the mark on the brink of half-time, at 2-1

Takumi Minamino was bright throughout and his performance was rewarded with a goal

A deft flick from Brazilian Roberto Firmino saw him also get on the score-sheet at Anfield

Sadio Mane was also in the right place at  the right time to tap in from close range

The hosts would come out for the second period and go on to hit the back of the net six times, blowing away their opponents with superior fitness levels.

A frantic four-minute spell saw both Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino ripple the net from close range, before teenager Harvey Elliott slalomed through Blackpool bodies to fire a powerful and low effort and register his first senior goal.

Takumi Minamino, who looked bright and industrious throughout the contest, was rewarded with a goal of his own before substitute Divock Origi scored after being set up by local lad Curtis Jones.

Icing was placed on the cake with another teen breaking their senior scoring duck, with Dutch defender Sepp Van den Berg finding the back of the net from close range.
