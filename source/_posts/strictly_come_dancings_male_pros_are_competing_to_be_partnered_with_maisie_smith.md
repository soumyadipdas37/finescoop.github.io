Coveted: Strictly Come Dancing's male professional dancers are reportedly in fierce competition to be partnered up with new recruit Maisie Smith for this year's series

Maisie, who stars as Tiffany Butcher on her hit BBC soap, won Strictly's Children In Need special alongside former Kevin Clifton last year – making her a favourite to win.

A source said: 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer. She has a massive fan following, which often ensures contestants get far in the competition.'

Reports of the behind-the-scenes competition comes after it was revealed that Maisie is under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette'.

The actress was at the centre of controversy over the summer, when she was spotted smoking at the cigarette at the wheel of her car.

According to The Sun, BBC bosses were 'angry' and 'extremely disappointed' after Maisie was caught smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, after pulling over on an empty road in Essex on Sunday July 19.

MailOnline contacted representatives for Maisie Smith and Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.

The actress has also reportedly ruffled feathers after signing a big money TikTok deal, despite being told not to by soap chiefs.

Ballroom favourite: According to The Sun, a number of the show's men are vying to be the EastEnders star's dance partner, citing her huge fan base and proven abilities

Maisie apparently violated the terms of her EastEnders contract by inking a deal to promote musicians on the app. 

The teen previously allegedly turned down an eye-watering amount of money from a record label to promote their artists' music on her videos. 

She reportedly rejected the offer after being told it would breach her EastEnders contract, however she is believed to have gone on to accept a second deal.

An EastEnders spokesperson told the publication: 'We are looking into this matter.'

Meanwhile, the star reportedly turned down a record deal – which promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue' – so that she could take part on Strictly this year. 

Brilliant: A source said of the actress, 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer'

She is said to have been told by BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly. 

A source told The Sun: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality. 

'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.

'Maisie decided to take Strictly over the deal because she can revisit music after the show. This will give her an even bigger platform than EastEnders to show off her talents. She hopes it will be a huge chance for her.'

Not impressed: Maisie, who plays Tiffany Butcher on EastEnders (pictured), has reprtedly violated the terms of her EastEnders contract by inking a deal to promote musicians on Tik Tok
