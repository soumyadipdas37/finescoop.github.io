Manchester City have opened talks with Benfica over a £50million deal for defender Ruben Dias.

The Premier League title contenders have switched to the stylish 23-year-old after growing frustrated by Sevilla's valuation of Jules Kounde.

Dias has long been on their shortlist but had been priced at £87million owing to his buy out clause.

The knock-on effects of the covid pandemic though mean Benfica are now willing to drop their price to attract much needed revenue.

City may also include Nicolas Otamendi in negotiations but Benfica would prefer a straight cash deal at this stage.

Dias has a long-term contract until the summer of 2024 at the Portuguese side.

Guardiola is an admirer of the Portugal international, who made 49 appearances across all competitions for club and country last season.
