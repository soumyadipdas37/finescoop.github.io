She may be stuck inside during Melbourne's six-week stage 4 lockdown.

But The Bachelor's Snezana Wood is still making sure to find time for glamour.

The mother-of-three showed off her cleavage and stunning figure in a chic sequinned blazer mini dress while playing dress ups at her home in South Yarra, on Tuesday.

The 38-year-old posted some stunning photos of her sexy ensemble to Instagram, and revealed her daily struggle in an accompanying caption.

Snezana explained she was looking after her children, Eve, 15, daughter Willow, two, and her baby Charlie, while her husband and Bachelor beau Sam Wood was working.

'When you’re in stage 4 lockdown, @samjameswood is working, @eve.vict is in remote learning and you’re not allowed to have a babysitter but you still want to take pics for the gram (...so you can pretend you don’t spend all day in food covered sweats and work out gear),' she wrote.

Snezana and Sam met on the third season of The Bachelor in 2015.

The reality star couple later married in Byron Bay in December 2018.

They are proud parents to three children: baby Charlie, daughter Willow and Eve - Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship.

Earlier this year, Snezana and Sam revealed how they celebrated Charlie taking her first steps.

Appearing on Channel Seven's The Morning Show, Sam said: 'Little Charlie took her first steps on the weekend, so that was a big milestone.'

'That means she's more mobile than ever,' the personal trainer added with a laugh.

Host Larry Emdur asked the couple: 'Was Charlie's first step a normal step or more of a lunge?'

Sam jokingly answered: 'It was a one-legged burpee with a clap.'
