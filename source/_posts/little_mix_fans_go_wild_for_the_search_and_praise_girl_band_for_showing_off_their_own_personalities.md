Little Mix fans were left delighted on Saturday night after the girl group's new TV show launched.

In the debut episode of The Search Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall were on the hunt for a boyband, with them auditioning hopeful potentials. 

However as well as loving the performances, many viewers praised the programme for being 'much more personal than other talent shows' as well as saying the band's personalities made it a success.    

What a debut! Little Mix fans were left delighted on Saturday night after the band's new talent show The Search kicked off

Fans were dazzled by the show, which was pre-recorded, with dozens praising Little Mix for adding their own twist on the already established talent TV genre.

One wrote: 'You were contestants yourself and you really have your own talent show now helping other people live their dreams. Definitely the best people <3'

And someone else added: 'A talent show where the acts are constructively critiqued from a potion of actual genuine experience. Wonderful. And Little Mix.'

'This show is so much more personal than all the other talent shows out there, Little Mix are really the standard for everything in this industry,' wrote a third fan.  

Impressive: As well as loving the auditions, music lovers praised the girlband for showing their own personalities on camera (Jesy Nelson and Leigh-Anne Pinnock pictured)









Impressed: Fans praised The Search for being 'personal' and showing Little Mix's own personalities  

While another tweeted: 'Little Mix: The Search is already one of the best talent shows on telly! Those 4 are carrying it on their personalities alone.'

Another fan said: 'What I love the most about Little Mix show is not only seeing the chance to see what talent the contestants are going to bring but the personalities and the girls humour. I'm really glad the girls did this show.' 

However for some the excitement was too much with music lovers saying they had got 'emotional' watching the girls on the show and were feeling 'so proud'.

The Search kicked off by trying to find members for a boyband with Talis, Lee, Zeekay, Adam and Kaci making the final cut.

Surprises! Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall took their judging roles very seriously as they reacted to the stellar performances from male singers

Tough decisions: The girls received thousands of entries and had to narrow it down to those who would be invited to an in-person interview, which was filmed before lockdown

High tech! Ahead of each hopeful auditioning for Little Mix a 'social screen' would show some of their pictures and a video

Overall there will be six categories with girl dance, girl vocal, mixed, vocal and instrument, as well as rap and R&B, coming up in other episodes.

During Saturday's episode Little Mix also showed they're well suited to choosing talent by giving lots of constructive criticism.

They also had viewers laughing inbetween the auditions as they joked around and showed just how close they've become since their own win of the X Factor.

After sending Adam through to the band room the girls started smelling themselves just in case there was anything off putting about them. 

What's that smell? After Adam's performance, and sharing a hug with the singer, the girls started checking they didn't smell

Hilarious: The band also joked that they would be needing some perfume for all the hugs they were about to get from the boys



Jokers: Fans were also amused by Little Mix smelling each other as they prepared for more hugs in the boyband auditions

Fans were also entertained by the girls jokes about the boys flirting with Jade and funny one liners.

Although having a successful launch on Saturday, ahead of their show kicking off Jade revealed that things didn't always go smoothly during the process.

The singer admitted that she 'went off in a huff a couple of times' after disagreeing with her bandmates while filming Little Mix: The Search.

She said things did get tense between herself, Perrie, Leigh-Anne and Jesy, at times as they searched for a band to join them on tour.

Up first: Adam was the first to audition and wowed with his vocals, although Little Mix weren't so impressed when he revealed he didn't know who NSYNC were

Future star? Labourer Lee also got through to the final band lineup with his unique sound

All together: Overall 10 boys were sent to the band room after the day of auditions 

Sing: After getting through the first audition the boys were split into smaller groups to prove if they could work together on harmonies 

With all four girls having strong opinions and acting as mentors, Leigh-Anne, 28, admitted they 'all have different tastes in music, so we were bound to disagree'.

While Jesy said she wasn't surprised they 'didn't see eye to eye', Jade told New! Magazine: 'Maybe I went off in a huff a couple of times'. 

Little Mix: The Search was originally thought as a rival for the X Factor, however music mogul Simon has decided to rest the show this year.  

Little Mix, who switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018, were originally formed on The X Factor in 2011.  

Wise words: Perrie took the lead in delivering critique over vocals, with the girls agreeing on most of the decisions 

Sweet: The band also took to Twitter before the show to share their excitement
