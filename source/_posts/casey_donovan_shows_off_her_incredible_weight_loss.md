Casey Donovan has been on a health and fitness kick during lockdown.

This week, the singer and actress revealed her weight loss across a six-month period in a series of incredible before and after photos.

In the first photo, taken on April 13, the 32-year-old shows off her bare stomach as she attempts to put on a pair of denim shorts.

Due to her weight, the star is completely unable to to zip the jeans up.

In a photo taken the next month on May 24, Casey has managed to do the top button up, but the fly is still open and the fit appears to be incredibly tight.

Finally, in the third photo taken on September 8, the shorts are completely buttoned and zipped up.

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph last week, Casey revealed that she's been focusing on healthy eating and a calorie deficit to lose weight. 

'My five a day would be broccolini, asparagus, sweet potato, onion (they’re a vegetable aren’t they?) and avocado,' she said.

'My body doesn’t work well on fruit in general because of my polycystic ovary syndrome.'

Flashback: Casey had a fuller figure in this selfie from November, 2019, taken a few months before she embarked on her fitness kick 

 The reality star has also started exercising, and also admitted that 'sex is great cardio'.

'I have tried shakes and I’ve tried keto but at the end of the day you have to find something that is sustainable for your body,' she explained.

'A calorie deficit is the best thing that has worked for my body, as well as upping my protein.'
