She's previously admitted to having a wild sex dream featuring a woman who looked like Megan Markle. 

And Jackie 'O' Henderson has now revealed she finds women physically more attractive than men. 

Jackie, who has remained single since splitting from husband Lee Henderson in 2018, made the surprising confession on Wednesday's Kyle And Jackie O Show during a discussion about female genitalia. 

'I just find women, overall, more attractive': Jackie 'O' Henderson, 45, revealed on Wednesday's Kyle And Jackie O Show that she finds women physically more attractive than men

'I would say, a girl's thing hanging out versus a guy's thing hanging out, is much more attractive,' she told co-host Kyle Sandilands and newsreader Brooklyn Ross. 

Stating her case, Jackie insisted: 'You know, ours is just a teeny tiny little bit, [while] yours is like a big ball that's hanging out - hairy and veiny.'    

Brooklyn joked that Jackie may be coming to a mid-life realisation about her sexual preference.

'You sound more and more like a lesbian every day, Jackie,' Brooklyn laughed, prompting Jackie to admit she's 'actually worried about herself'.   

Fascinated, Kyle queried whether Jackie thinks about women while 'pleasuring herself'.   

'No, that's where I know I'm not [a lesbian],' the blonde reasoned.

'When I think about sex I think about a guy. But for some reason I just find women, overall, more attractive,' the mother-of-one said. 

While heterosexual Kyle naturally agreed with the sentiment, Brooklyn - who is openly gay - had other ideas. 

'A guy with a 6-pack, don't you think that's hot?' Brooklyn insisted.

Jackie responded: 'If you were looking at the perfect man, like naked, and the perfect woman naked, I'd be drawn to the woman.'

In 2017, Jackie famously confessed on-air that she'd dreamed about a sexual encounter with a woman who resembled Megan Markle. 

Divulging the 'vivid' details, Jackie said: 'I'm on my back and I am nude and she's on top of me.'  

No doubt: Jackie responded: 'If you were looking at the perfect man, like naked, and the perfect woman naked, I'd be drawn to the woman'

'She was wearing a little white lacy g-string and was on all fours. I'm kissing her bottom and [Bruno Bouchet, a KIIS FM colleague] was there watching,' she added. 

Jackie announced her split from husband-of-14-years Lee Henderson in October 2018. 

The couple share custody of nine-year-old daughter, Catalina 'Kitty' Mae Henderson.
