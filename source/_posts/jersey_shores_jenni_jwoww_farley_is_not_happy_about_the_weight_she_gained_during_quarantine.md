Jersey Shore star Jenni 'JWoww' Farley reluctantly hit the gym on Monday to shed the weight she allegedly gained during lockdown from the coronavirus pandemic.

'I'd rather take selfie videos than work out right now. Not happy about this quarantine weight,' the 34-year-old reality star - who boasts 23.4M social media followers - lamented.

'But I was for sure happy eating and drinking all the crap that caused it!'

The 34-year-old reality star lamented: 'I'd rather take selfie videos than work out right now. Not happy about this quarantine weight, but I was for sure happy eating and drinking all the crap that caused it!'

However, Jenni appeared to just be fishing for compliments as her slim 5ft7in figure looks virtually the same as it did back in February.

Farley's castmates Deena Nicole Cortese, Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino, his wife Lauren, Wild 'N Out rapper Justina Valentine, and Mob Wives alum Renee Graziano commented with fire emojis and compliments on her post.

'Omg [you're] a skinny Minnie!' Deena wrote.

The Miss Domesticated blogger wasn't wrong about the sweets as she and her children - daughter Meilani, 6; and son Greyson, 4 - frequently cook pancakes, muffin pizza, mac and cheese balls, and rainbow cake for her vlogs.

It's ironic that Jenni loathes working out as the gym is practically the second home for her boyfriend, professional wrestler Zack Clayton Carpinello.

'#Blessed': Meanwhile, the 45-year-old Champ and The Tramp podcaster (L) moved on with bridal hair specialist Danielle Miele (2-R) in May 2019 - three months before his divorce from Farley was finalized (pictured August 2)

Farley went public with her 25-year-old toyboy in April 2019 after originally meeting at him at her 2015 wedding to Roger Mathews.

Meanwhile, the 45-year-old Champ and The Tramp podcaster moved on with bridal hair specialist Danielle Miele in May 2019 - three months before his divorce from the New York-born beauty was finalized.

Fans can expect much more from Jenni as MTV renewed her show Jersey Shore: Family Vacation for a fourth season on June 25.
