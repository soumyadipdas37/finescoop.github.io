Jessica Alves appeared in great spirits as she stepped out on Tuesday after treating herself to glamorous new hair extensions at Krystalized Hair Salon in Loughton.

The Brazilian reality star, 37, put on an eye-popping display in a busty black catsuit as she explained to MailOnline that her long hair is the 'ultimate symbol of femininity.'

Jessica flashed a broad smile as she emerged with significantly longer tresses than she was spotted with earlier in the day, with the star also revealing she maintains her tresses every six weeks.

Speaking about her hair transformation, Jessica said: 'Every 6 weeks I have to do the maintenance of my hair extensions.

'I find very therapeutic going to beauty Salons, I get to meet other ladies and exchange beauty tips and also to listen to their relationship dramas it is always fun.'

However, Jessica admitted that her flowing locks means more to her than just how she looks aesthetically. 

The blonde, who transitioned into a woman earlier this year, added to MailOnline: 'To me the long hair is the ultimate symbol of femininity.

'Day by day I see changes on my body and skin became more and more feminine my body now matches my soul and my mind.'

Despite a day in the salon chair, Jessica still dressed to impress for her appointment, slipping her killer curves into the form-fitting black number, which drew emphasis to her ample cleavage.

Jessica added a chic black cape jacket to her look, while she cinched in her narrow waist with a black and gold Gucci belt.

The TV personality accessorised her look with a quilted black Yves Saint Laurent handbag and quirky, pointed boots, while she carried her mobile and face mask in her hand.

Jessica, who is set to head Holland next week to film her new TV show, upped the glam with a sleek palette of make-up, while her freshly-done blonde tresses cascaded down her back. 

Jessica revealed on Thursday that she had her twelfth nose job, which she told MailOnline she didn't know she was set to have.

The reality personality shared a glimpse of her new nose via Instagram following the cosmetic procedure after visiting the Prof. Dr. Ali Gürlek in Istanbul, Turkey, on Wednesday, before she was seen leaving the city's W hotel the following day.

Jessica explained to MailOnline: 'Throughout the years I have had a lot of problems, I have had a lot of nose jobs done in Brazil, Colombia, Iran, America and here in Istanbul with great success. 

Candid: 'Day by day I see changes on my body and skin became more and more feminine my body now matches my soul and my mind'

Procedure: Jessica revealed on Thursday that she'd had her twelfth nose job and had 'great success' with the procedure in Istanbul (previous nose job pictured right)

'On the downside I've had infections with cartilage, but what caused problems was when they use cartilage from a donor and that's when my drama started a few years ago.

'My latest nose job was in January last year in Iran, the doctor cleared all my nose, removed all the cartilage and left it without any cartilage at all. That's why it was so shrunk.

'Now Dr. Ali Gürlek in Istanbul used cartilage from my ear and I can breathe much better now.'

Jessica added that she was refused the procedure five times, as she went on: 'I saw five different surgeons and everybody declined the surgery, they said they didn't know how to do it and they were overly negative.'
