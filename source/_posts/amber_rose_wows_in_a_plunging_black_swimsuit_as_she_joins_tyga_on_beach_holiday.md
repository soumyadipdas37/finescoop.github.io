She is currently holidaying with her baby daddy Alexander Edwards as well as his best friend Tyga and a group of their pals in Cabo, Mexico.

And Amber Rose and her friends appeared to be having a great time soaking up the sun on the beach on Thursday, before hitting the water on a jet-ski.

Amber sported her signature blonde buzz cut and appeared to go make-up free for their outing, while also revealing her selection of tattoos.

The star later showcased her adrenaline junkie side, as she donned an orange lifejacket and hopped onto a jet ski before whizzing around the bay.

She was joined on the shoreline by rapper Tyga as they chatted to two female companions together.

She was later seen helping a female pal out, as she helped to retie her leopard print cut-out bikini.

Her boyfriend Alexander later made an appearance on the beach as he was seen joining the group, while Amber rested an affectionate hand on his shoulder. 

Tyga, 30, showed off his muscular physique in a pair of colourful green swim shorts, over a pair of Calvin Klein underpants.

Amber and Alexander appeared to be without their 11-month-old son Slash. 

In addition to Slash, Amber shares seven-year-old Sebastian Thomaz with the rapper Wiz Khalifa, 32.

Amber and Wiz got engaged in March 2012 and married in July 2013, but it was announced in September 2014 that she was filing for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.

Amber previously dated rapper Kanye West, 43, for two years starting in 2008. 

Back in February, Amber shocked her fans by getting 'Bash Slash' tattooed on her forehead, for her sons Sebastian and Slash.

She said she was partly inspired to get the ink after Kobe Bryant's death in a helicopter crash in January.

A.E. complemented her by getting the birth dates of both sons tattooed on his own forehead.
