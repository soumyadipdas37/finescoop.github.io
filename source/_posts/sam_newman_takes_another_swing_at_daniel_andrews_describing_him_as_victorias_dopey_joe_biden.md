Controversial media personality Sam Newman has had another crack at under-pressure Premier Daniel Andrews, describing him as 'Victoria's dopey Joe Biden.'

The 300-game AFL Geelong Cats champion and former Footy Show host vented his frustrations as a string of strict stage four lockdown restrictions were relaxed in Melbourne.

While swimming in pools and personal training sessions outdoors are now permitted in the two hours of daily exercise, golf remains off-limits. 

A renowned golf tragic, Newman saw Sunday's announcement as another excuse to take another potshot at the Premier, likening him to presidential candidate and former US vice president Joe Biden.

Sam Newman has once again attacked the Victorian Premier over lockdown restrictions

'Andrews has become Victoria's dopey Joe Biden. To say communal swimming is ok (because it doesn't require a facility), but golf is not, shows the IQ required of an elected official. Unwittingly, he has given consent for sedition. #victorialockdown,' Newman tweeted on Sunday.

His views sparked several hundred comments and divided opinion. 

'You can mingle in a park with a 100 strangers but can't play a round of golf with your friends. Where is the data and science behind all these bogus decisions? Never been a more incompetent government in our history,' one person agreed.

Another added: 'Access to playing golf can be easily modified - just hypothetically you could restrict rounds to nine holes, extend minutes between tee off times, max two in a group, no access to change rooms.'

But many others welcomed the phased easing of lockdown and disagreed with Newman.

'I dunno Sam. A bunch of old codgers, susceptible the virus hanging out together compared to lone submerged swimmers in outdoor pools where the scientific evidence shows the virus does not spread in pools, chlorinated etc. But ya know, gotta have that IQ I suppose,' one man tweeted.

Another added: 'It is all about reducing the risk and movement of people. The more activities that are allowed straight away, the more chance of a  third wave. We are 40 per cent chance of a third wave if we open up too quick. Golf can wait a couple of weeks.'

Newman's latest comments come a fortnight after he called for manslaughter charges to be laid against Andrews over his handling of the pandemic.

Of the 872 lives lost to coronavirus in Australia, 784 were in Victoria.

He also urged his fellow Victorians to protest the lockdown last month.

'Of all the protests that we have put up with, how about a quarter million of us gather in the CBD to take the City/State back, before EVERY previous march will have been pointless,' he tweeted at the time.

Newman was forced to backtrack on his comments and received a warning from police.

Melbourne's 9pm to 5am curfew was lifted on Monday after being enforced for eight weeks in a bid to bring the state's second deadly wave under control.
