Lydia said in an Instagram Q&A: 'I had no pain relief and you're not any more of a hero if you don't have pain relief but for me I'm quite an anti-drug person so I try to avoid taking any type of medication if I can.

She added: 'When I was in labour all I wanted was a Pukka pie and chips, so that's what I had.'
