We seem to have reached peak cocktail hour. Socially distanced spritzers in the garden, cocktails shaken to celebrate the children’s return to school — no excuse seems too slim right now.

But did you know you can enjoy your favourite cocktail any time, without risk of hangover, simply through your chosen fragrance?

Notes in many perfumes echo those of our chosen tipples: alongside gin-like juniper, hints of rum, whisky and cognac are all now available for use in scents.

‘If you think of the composition of whisky, there are facets that are earthy and peaty, but there’s also rose and honey,’ says perfumer Yann Vasnier.

Perfume-makers have always been clever olfactory mixologists, adding a dash of aldehydes (used in Chanel No.5), for a champagne-like sparkle, a twist of lime for zing, or a shot of juicy red fruit.

Here we’ve compiled a menu of fragrances to shake and stir the senses. Chin, chin!

Try Juliette Has A Gun Moscow Mule.   

50ml eau de parfum, selfridges.com

Get ready to party with a perfume that re-imagines the euphoria of this ginger-powered cocktail. Alongside the twist of ginger and zesty lemon, enjoy bergamot for extra sparkle.

Try Pepe Jeans for Her Cocktail Edition.   

80ml eau de toilette, superdrug.com

This doesn’t just smell like a cocktail, its stunning bottle looks like one, too (pictured). Juicy in the extreme, with blueberry and raspberry, pineapple and cassis, poured over white flowers, sandalwood and sugar-spun amber.

 Try Carolina Herrera 212 VIP Rosé 

50ml eau de parfum, boots.com

This scent positively fizzes with notes of rosé champagne, peach tree flower, the tingle of pink pepper and musk, plus ‘the essence of the most exclusive party in NYC’, the makers promise. Dust off those high heels and rummage in the wardrobe for a frock before spritzing this on.

 Try Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Coconut Fizz

 75ml eau de toilette, johnlewis.com

A tropical breeze of luscious coconut gusts through this scent, which is also sunlit with bright citrus notes. Its counterpart in Guerlain’s summer 2020 collection, meanwhile, is Aqua Allegoria Granada Salvia, a must for anyone who loves the sweet tang of pomegranate.

 Try Tocca Bianca 

50ml eau de parfum, tocca.com

From an Italian fragrance house whose name translates as ‘touch’, zesty Bianca bursts into life with a blend of lemon and mandarin so citrus-fresh it sets your nose a-tingle.

 

 Try Atkinsons Pirates’ Grand Reserve

 100ml eau de parfum, harrods.com

As the sun sets on Grand Reserve, you’ll be bathed in the scent of patchouli, Madagascan vanilla, cocoa bean and cedarwood. Was piracy ever this glamorous? 

Try Histoires de Parfums This Is Not A Blue Bottle 1/.6

60ml eau de parfum, histoiresdeparfums.com

More like an Aperol spritz on steroids, with its extraordinary citrus hit: sweet orange, yuzu and grapefruit are catapulted from the striking bottle, garlanded by white floral neroli, orange blossom and lotus.
