He told The Sun: 'The worst decision I made after the show was when I was running along the canal.

'It was too hot and I took my top off. Somebody nearly came over the top of their bike because they were screaming.

'I would have felt very guilty if they had been injured.'

Normal People delighted the nation when it aired in April, with millions of viewers following the romance between Paul's character Connell Waldron and Marianne Sheridan, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones. 

Recalling the reality of shooting awkward sex scenes, the star revealed on one day of filming that the contact between their bodies made a fart noise.  

He said: 'On the Friday of the first week, me and Daisy had to do a day of sex scenes and we were covered in this gel called Egyptian Magic. It's basically fake sweat.

'We had to switch positions and our bodies were in close contact. When we separated it made a really loud fart noise. 

'Me and Daisy started hysterically laughing, but the crew and director (Lenny Abrahamson) all thought that one of us had farted and really were trying to preserve our dignity.

'They were like, 'OK, we're going to just go again'. So yeah, that was pretty embarrassing. It totally takes any tension out of situations.

'Once you fake fart in front of the other person, it's all good.'

Earlier this month, Paul admitted that his co-star Daisy's Emmy snub was 'disappointing'.

Paul, who was shortlisted in the Best Actor in a Limited Series or a Television Movie category, soared to fame during lockdown for the Sally Rooney novel adapted TV show.  

Talking about his nomination and co-star Daisy's, 22, snub, Paul told Just Jared: 'It's disappointing because I would love to have shared that with her.'

Paul also revealed that the first person he wanted to tell about his exciting Emmy nomination was his mother but he couldn't get in touch.

He added: 'I was trying to voice call everybody on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was picking up. 

'I think they were all kind of scared. When I got everybody on the call, it was pretty amazing. My brother who never cries was crying.'
