A family's pet Chow Chow-cross mauled a 12-day-old boy to death while his mother was on the toilet and his father was outside with another child, an inquest has heard.

Elon Jase Ellis-Joynes was savaged by the dog called Teddy on Sunday, September 13, at the family home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

Baby Elon was still alive when his heartbroken mother Abigail Ellis frantically called an ambulance, Doncaster Coroner's Court heard on Thursday.

She told the 999 call handler that Elon was breathing, but was 'really poorly' and was 'bleeding from his leg or his stomach'.

Mrs Ellis and Mr Joynes (pictured together) were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence after the incident. Both have been bailed pending further inquiries.

David Copley, coroner's officer, told the court: 'At 15.04 on Sunday, September 13, a call was made to South Yorkshire Ambulance by Abigail Ellis.

'She stated that her son, Elon, was breathing, but was really poorly.

'He was bleeding from his leg or his tummy, she thought that one of the dogs had bitten Elon.

'She had been on the toilet and her partner Stephen was outside with another child and came running in.

'Officers attended and Stephen Joynes identified Elon to police officers.'

Elon, who was born on September 1, was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later.

No family members were present during the brief hearing and senior coroner Nicola Mundy released Elon's body so that a funeral can take place.

She said: 'I want to release Elon for the purposes of a funeral to proceed.

'I am aware that there is an ongoing investigation and I adjourn this inquest until matters are investigated.'

Emergency services were called to the home shortly after 3pm on Sunday, September 13

Prior to the inquest, police said the baby had suffered serious injuries after being attacked by a dog and died a short time later in hospital.

A police spokesman said that the dog was removed from the address and will remain in secure kennels until the force's inquiries have been completed.

Floral tributes were left at the family's mid-terrace house as well-wishers and neighbours offered their support for the family.

Elon was the third generation of Mrs Ellis's family to die in the house in recent years, after she lost her father and previous partner.

Mrs Ellis and Mr Joynes were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence after the incident.

Both have been bailed pending further inquiries.
