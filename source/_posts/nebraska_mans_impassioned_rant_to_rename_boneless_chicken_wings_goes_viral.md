A Nebraska man issued a heartfelt plea for his city council to stop using the term 'boneless chicken wings' because the popular menu item doesn't actually come from the wing of the bird.

Chemical engineer Ander Christensen, from Lincoln, passionately told a local council meeting to 'remove the name boneless wings from our menus and from our hearts' because 'we need to raise our children better'.

He proposed alternative terms that he felt better represented what the snack actually is - such as 'wet tenders', 'Buffalo-style chicken tenders' and even 'saucy nugs'.

Alternatively, Mr Christensen - who is the son of Lincoln City Council member Roy Christensen - defiantly suggested they should just be called 'trash'.

The clip of Mr Christensen's genuine calls to make his town a 'social leader' of the cause quickly went viral, USA Today reports.

In it, he says: 'Lincoln has the opportunity to be a social leader in this country. 

'We have been casually ignoring a problem that has gotten so out of control that our children are throwing around names and words without even understanding their true meaning, treating things as though they are normal.

'I go into nice family restaurants and I see people throwing this name around and pretending as though everything is just fine.

'I'm talking about boneless chicken wings.'

Traditionally, the snack is made out of breadcrumb-coated chicken pressed served in a buffalo wing-style sauce.

He adds: 'Number one: nothing about boneless wings actually come from the wing of a chicken.

'We would be disgusted if a butcher was mislabelling their cuts of meat, yet we go around pretending as though the breast of a chicken is in its wing? 

'Number two: boneless wings are just cuts which are already boneless. I don't go and order boneless tacos, I don't go and order boneless club sandwiches, I don't ask for boneless auto repair, it's just what's expected.

'Then number three: We need to raise our children better. Our children are being raised afraid of having bones attached to their meat.

'That's where meat comes from, it grows on bones.

'We need to teach them that the wing of a chicken is from a chicken. And it's delicious.

'I propose that we rename boneless wings in the city of Lincoln. We can call them 'buffalo-style chicken tenders'. We can call them 'saucy nugs' or 'trash'.

'We can take these steps and show the county where we stand. And that we understand we've been living a lie for too long. 

After the hilarious clip went Viral, Mr Christensen took to Twitter sharing a meme about his thoughts

'And we know it because we feel it in our bones. 

His father Roy - who watched on during his son's impassioned statement - adds: 'For the record, that's my son.'

Mr Christensen told local media: 'I am not in the pocket of big chicken.

'Some have actively put out wanted signs for me for saying slander.'

He added: 'I am going to start a committee to check the prospects of running for president because we need a candidate that’s bipartisan that people can get behind and know that he’s the man to solve the issues.'

Talking of boneless wings he said: 'Unless you’re going to strap those things to the side of a jet you cannot call them a wing.'
