It's territory only the bravest fashionistas dare tread, but Jenni Falconer took the divisive double denim look one step further by wearing a blue jean jumpsuit on Tuesday. 

The Scottish presenter, 44, caught the eye for all the right reasons as she left Global Radio Studios in the fitted one-piece and made her way across London's Leicester Square. 

The near-skintight outfit served to accentuate fitness mad Jenni's slender physique following her latest stint on the airwaves.

The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.

Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers.

She said of the new role: 'Start 2 Run is perfect for complete beginners and people who have started running during lockdown and hit the 5K distance.

'Running has become a lifeline for so many of us – as our daily exercise and a way of getting some fresh air.

'For many people, building up to a 5K or just beginning to jog short distances has shown the joy of running and this app is the perfect coaching tool to keep you going.'

The presenter is no stranger to keeping active and often shares images and videos of herself working out and staying fit on social media.
