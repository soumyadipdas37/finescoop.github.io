Earlier this year Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake became parents for the second time, DailyMail.com revealed in July.

And now Timberlake's former NSYNC band mate Lance Bass has shared with Entertainment Tonight that the little child is 'cute.'

But the 41-year-old Dancing With The Stars veteran did not dare reveal the name of the baby as Justin would 'kill him' if he did. 

Sweet news! Earlier this year Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake, seen in October 2019, became parents for the second time, DailyMail.com revealed in July. And now Timberlake's former NSYNC band mate Lance Bass has shared with Entertainment Tonight the baby is 'cute'

Timberlake and Biel already have son Silas, aged five.

'The baby is cute of course, it's Justin and Jessica!' Bass told the site as he admitted that he had seen photos of the newborn.

But he did not want to share the name of the child. He joked: 'That's a good question…Justin would kill me!' 

Representatives for both Timberlake and Biel have been contacted for comment.

In August Brian McKnight confirmed to Hollywood Life that the couple had a second child.

'Having kids and having his family, I think [Justin] took some time to focus on those things because those things are very important,' he said.

'I think if he’s going to do music, he’s going to make sure that that's secure, and then he'll bring us into his music,' he continued. 'And being inspired! He just had a new baby. I think that's going to be really inspiring for him and he'll have some new music based on that, I'm sure.'

DailyMail.com was first to share the news that Jessica and Justin had a second child adding Biel's mother Kimberly Conroe Biel was with her daughter and newest grandchild at the time of the birth. 

Timberlake and Biel have not been pictured publicly since March and are thought to have been staying at their home in Big Sky, Montana, since March 25.

Jessica's last Instagram post was from Tuesday as she posted chest up in a hoodie with no makeup on.

The birth of the couple's new son comes months after Timberlake was caught getting close to his co-star Alisha Wainwright, 31, during a night out in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Timberlake and Wainwright were filming NFL movie Palmer at the time, in which they play lovers.

Onlookers told the Sun Timberlake, who was not wearing his wedding ring, appeared to have been drinking heavily but said he and Wainwright 'were smiling and laughing'. 

Two weeks later, Timberlake apologized to Biel for the indiscretion with a public mea culpa posted on Instagram in which he admitted to drinking too much on the night in question.

In it, he said: 'I stay away from gossip as much as I can, but for my family, I feel it is important to address recent rumors that are hurting the people I love.

'A few weeks ago, I displayed a strong lapse in judgement – but let me be clear – nothing happened between me and my co-star.

'I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son.

'I want to apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be.

'This was not that. I am incredibly proud to be working on Palmer. Looking forward to continuing to make the movie and excited for people to see it.'

Neither Biel nor Wainwright have ever publicly addressed the incident.
