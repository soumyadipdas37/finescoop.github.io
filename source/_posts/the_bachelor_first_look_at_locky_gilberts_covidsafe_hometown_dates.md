The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert is set to face his toughest challenge yet as he meets the families of his final four contenders during hometown visits on Wednesday.

And in a trailer for the penultimate episode, the 31-year-old adventure tour guide reveals how this year's hometowns will adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Locky explains in the promo that he won't be leaving Sydney and the families will 'come to him' instead. They will also have to follow social distancing rules.

'I cant believe it's hometowns already, but not as we know it,' he says.

'Unfortunately because of COVID, it's a little bit different. The families are coming to me, and there's going to be some social distancing and stuff, but I'm still glad to get to know their family.'

Despite having home-field advantage when it comes to the location, Locky admits that meeting the families is still a daunting task.

'I know I'm going to get a grilling and I know I'm going to get questions that I have trouble answering,' he adds. 

'But I'm pretty good with families, so I'm ready for this.'

The Bachelor's final four was decided last Thursday, when fifth-place contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe failed to receive a rose.
