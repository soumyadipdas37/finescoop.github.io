The new Women's Super League season starts on Saturday and although Chelsea could be considered fortunate to have won the 2019-20 title after the campaign was brought to a premature end, it is difficult to see the Blues giving up their crown.

Sportsmail's Ian Herbert and Kathryn Batte have analysed the runners and riders ahead of the big kick-off, with Aston Villa hosting Manchester City in the first match at 2:30pm.

Who will win the league?

In the words of one senior WSL club executive, it’s a ‘two-and-a-half horse race’. Chelsea and Manchester City, the league’s big spenders, seem likely to fight it out again and Arsenal under Joe Montemurro will be the dark horses.



No team have won back-to-back titles since Liverpool in 2013-2014, but it’s hard see past Emma Hayes’ champions Chelsea, who haven’t lost a competitive game since April 2019 and who have set the pace in one of the busiest windows in WSL history.

Few WSL transfers carry a fee, but Pernille Harder’s arrival from Champions League finalists Wolfsburg is thought to have cost a world record £300,000.

She, Australian Sam Kerr and Beth England provide a remarkable strike force at Chelsea, though Kerr has taken time to acclimatise.



City have also recruited, with USA internationals Rose Lavelle and Sam Mewis their new star names, but reclaiming the title from Chelsea is a big ask of their new manager Gareth Taylor, brought in from the men’s youth set-up at the club.

Arsenal haven’t spent big but they could make a challenge if Vivianne Miedema, top of the WSL for goals and assists last season, maintains her form. Arsenal may also benefit from not being in the Champions League.

And who looks doomed?

Birmingham and Bristol City narrowly avoided the drop last season, averaging less than a point a game along with Brighton, and both could be set for another relegation battle, with the financial effects far worse for sides whose parent clubs are not in the Premier League.

Bristol have had the stronger window of the two, with five new players, and have kept impressive England youth forward Ebony Salmon.

Birmingham have a new manager in Carla Ward from Championship club Sheffield United but have lost two experienced players in Lucy Staniforth and Rachel Williams.

A team for the neutrals?

Aston Villa’s £2m budget is dwarfed by the £5m-plus of Chelsea and City, but last season’s Championship title- winners ooze equality between the men’s and women’s set-ups.

Both squads train at Bodymoor Heath and the women’s side, often watched on Sundays by men’s manager Dean Smith, also use the Premier League team’s match day bus.

They have invested in a strong girls’ academy set-up this summer, as well as bringing in six recruits from Germany, Scotland, Portugal and England.

A mid-table finish would be a good return for manager Gemma Davies, at 28 the youngest coach in the WSL, though Birmingham City will probably want to have a say in that.

Having trailed the Blues in the women’s football stakes, Villa have replaced them as the most ambitious side in the Midlands with a recruitment policy which has included poaching many of their players.

Emma Follis, Marisa Ewers, Shania Hayles were all part of an exodus from Birmingham. Villa also poached Cristina Torkildsen to run their girls’ academy. Some lively Midlands derbies await.

Will Liverpool go straight back up?

No guarantees. It was humiliating for them to drop out of the WSL in the year that the men finally won the Premier League and the fact that the club’s new £50m training base doesn’t accommodate the women is not encouraging.

A number of the players who left after relegation posted tweets stating that they were heading for a more challenging environment elsewhere. Their close-season signings are not exactly world class, though new Danish No 9 Amalie Thestrup from Roma could be exciting.

There had been some expectation that Vicky Jepson’s side would be the only professionals in the Championship, though Leicester City have announced they will be fully pro, too, and they have been spending strongly. Sheffield United, free-scoring runners-up last season, have hired respected manager Neil Redfearn.

Redfearn appears to have concluded that Liverpool’s women’s set-up lacked ambition when he left them after only three months in 2018.

The recent appointment of Liverpool’s director of communications, Susan Black, to the main board as executive director of Liverpool FC Women seems significant in giving more of a voice to the women’s set-up.

Has Covid set the women’s game back?

In many ways, yes. Without the pandemic, we would be entering the season on the back of a Great Britain team having competed at the Olympics and ending with a build-up to England at Euro 2021. That tournament has now been put back a year. Before last weekend’s Community Shield, there had been no elite domestic women’s football since the Continental Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea on February 29 and with the FA currently in the midst of a swathe of redundancies, the game is hardly awash with cash.

But there are grounds for optimism. With the start date of the National Women’s Soccer League in the US still shrouded in uncertainty, a number of US players — including Lavelle, Mewis and Jess Fishlock — are moving here.

It is no coincidence that US broadcaster NBC has just announced plans to broadcast 50 games from the WSL this season, bringing badly needed profile and income.

DAZN will also stream 44 matches in Germany and Italy. The appointment of Ian Wright as a WSL ambassador has already proved a shrewd move by the FA.

Phil Neville’s biggest hope for the season?

Though his replacement as England manager, Sarina Wiegman, has been appointed already, Neville will want to bow out on a high with the British team at next summer’s Tokyo Olympics, and few young players offer as much potential for him as one of Manchester City’s new signings, Chloe Kelly.

The 22-year-old scored nine goals in the WSL for Everton last season and rejected offers from Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid to join Gareth Taylor’s side. She could be a huge asset in Japan.
