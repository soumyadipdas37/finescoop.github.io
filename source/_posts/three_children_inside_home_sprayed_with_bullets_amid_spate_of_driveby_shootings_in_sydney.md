Nine people including three children survived after being inside a home targeted in a drive-by attack in the latest in a string of shootings in Sydney.

Police were called to a home on Runcorn Street in St Johns Park at about 11.35 on Tuesday night after reports the residence was ambushed by gun fire.

Several windows and cars on the property were damaged in the drive-by attack, while none of the nine people who were home were injured.

Detectives have established a crime scene and have appealed to the public for information regarding two dark-coloured sedans and a dark-coloured SUV, which were seen near the home at the time of the attack.

The incident is the sixth shooting in Sydney's west and southwest since August 26, sparking fears of a bikie war breaking out across the city.

Shots were fired in a unit with three people inside on Columbine Avenue in Punchbowl before 8.45 on Tuesday night.

No one was injured and several people were seen leaving the site in a silver car.

Police are investigating the crime scene and no arrests have been made for either shooting.

There were another two shootings in the city on Monday night, with Mark Shammo shot in the legs and torso on Garrong Road in Lakemba at about 8.15.

The 29-year-old was taken to hospital for surgery on non-life threatening injuries after taking shelter in a home, while four men fled from the scene in a white SUV.

'We are definitely of the belief that this was a targeted attack,' Acting Superintendent Dennis Donohue told 9News.

'It's of great concern to us that this man was attacked in the private residence with other innocent members of the public.'

Later that evening two children were among nine survivors in a drive-by shooting in a home on Tarlington Parade in Bonnyrigg at about 11.30pm.

NSW police said a person was seen fleeing in a white hatchback following the attack.

Inquiries are continuing and no arrests have been made for either shooting.

Former Comancheros bikie Fares Abounader died in a hail of bullets outside his home at Wall Avenue in Panania before midnight on Saturday night. 

Despite the best efforts of his family, a neighbour and emergency services the 39-year-old was unable to be saved and died at the scene.

'The shooting was very calculated and very deliberate and quite brazen,' Detective Superintendent Robert Critchlow said on Sunday. 

'Despite the fact that the victim is known to police it doesn't change the fact he was a family man. His wife and young child were home at the time.

'No-one deserves to be treated like this and murdered in such a callous fashion in front of his home.'

It is believed Mr Abounader was the victim of a targeted shooting as tensions continue to simmer between the Comancheros and Bandidos.

Mr Abounader was allegedly involved in the 2009 brawl at Sydney Airport, when Comancheros bikies clashed with their Hells Angels rivals.

Hells Angel member Anthony Zervas was killed and then-Comanchero boss Mick Hawi, who died in 2018, was charged with manslaughter.

Mr Abounader fled the scene after allegedly throwing a knife down a drain.

Lastly, Mohamed Saab was found with gunshot wounds to his shoulder, ribs and leg outside a home in Knoll Avenue in Turrella before 7am on August 26.

Neighbours swarmed the street as the 37-year-old father-of-two was hauled into an ambulance and taken to St George Hospital in a serious condition. 

Many have been left shaken by the shooting of the well-known businessman who they say is a 'role model'.

Investigators are still piecing together what sparked the shooting, which they believe was targeted.

A dark sedan was spotted leaving the area moments after the attack.

'Some of the information that has come forward leads us to believe this was not a random incident,' Chief Inspector Chris Hill said.

As inquiries continue, anyone who was in the area or who has information has been urged to come forward to police.
