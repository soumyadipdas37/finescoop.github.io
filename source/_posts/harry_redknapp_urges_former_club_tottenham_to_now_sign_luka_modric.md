Harry Redknapp has urged former club Tottenham to now make a move for Luka Modric as they prepare to finalise Gareth Bale's sensational return to the club.

Bale is expected to complete a return to north London imminently on a season-long loan deal worth over £13million.

But Redknapp believes his former club should go one step further and bring another ex-player back to the club, insisting Luka Modric could add another dimension to Jose Mourinho's midfield.

Speaking on Stats Perform News, Redknapp said: 'I'd go and see if I could get Luka Modric back. Take the pair of them, Bale and Modric.

'That would be a great coup. Luka is still a fantastic player. That would be amazing.

'I still feel they need somebody there; they've got the forward players, but they need somebody to supply the bullets.

'That's where someone like Luka Modric can play killer passes, into great movement up front. They lack a player like that.'

Modric played for Spurs between 2008 and 2012, establishing himself as one of the best midfielders in the world before leaving for the Bernabeu.

Real signed him for around £30m and he has gone on to win the Champions League on four occasions, as well as LaLiga twice.

He is out of contract next summer and it remains to be seen how willing the Spanish giants will be to offer him new terms, given Modric has just turned 35.

But he made 40 appearances for Zinedine Zidane last season, hinting he is still very much a part of his plans and it would take a huge fee to lure him back to Spurs.

Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Bale had sealed a season-long loan return to Tottenham.

He will have medical tests in Madrid on Friday before flying to London in the next 24 hours to ratify the move. A few minor formalities were completed on Thursday and all that is left is for Bale to arrive and sign.

Boss Jose Mourinho refused to be drawn on the Bale deal after Thursday night's Europa League victory against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Bulgaria.

'I can't comment,' he said. 'I don't comment on something that I don't know. For me, at this moment, until Gareth Bale is a Tottenham player I still think and respect the fact that he is a Real Madrid player. I am not going to comment on a Real Madrid player.'

Tottenham have also sealed their £27million swoop for left back Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid. He completed his medical on Thursday, which could open the door for Ryan Sessegnon to leave on loan.
