He's one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. 

And Hugh Jackman, 51, proved his nice guy credentials yet again on Saturday, while walking his beloved dogs Dali and Allegra in New York. 

The masked-up X-Men star happily chatted to NYPD officers as he strolled through the city's West Village neighbourhood.

Ahead of the Grammy Awards, Hugh looked calm and relaxed as he shared a brief conversation with officers on duty.

Despite the sunny day, Hugh opted for a pair of loose-fitting blue chinos and a plain black sweater. 

He finished his outfit with a pair of blue sneakers and a black trucker hat.

Believed to have also been running a few errands, Hugh carried a number of items in a plastic bag.   

Hugh, wife Deborra-Lee Furness, 64, and their children Ava, 14, and Oscar, 20, recently returned to New York from their stunning holiday home in the Hamptons.

In July, Hugh revealed he was homesick for Australia after a lengthy lockdown in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Deborra-lee and the couple's children, Oscar and Ava, had initially been in Melbourne when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March.

But they returned to the U.S. just four days later in order to keep the family together. 

Hugh will virtually attend The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards this week.

He is one of five nominees up for an Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Limited TV series or Movie for his role as Frank Tassone in Bad Education.

'I'm humbled by the nominations for both me and the film and excited to be named with such a talented group of actors,' Hugh said in a statement at the time. 

Jimmy Kimmel will host the show from a stage inside California's Staples Center, which will have no red carpet or audience, Variety reported last month.
