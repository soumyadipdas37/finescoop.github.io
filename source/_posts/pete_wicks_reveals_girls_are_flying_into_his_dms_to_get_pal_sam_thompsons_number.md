'It is an intrinsic human trait, and a deep responsibility, I think, to be an organ and a blade. But, learning to forgive ourselves and others because we have not chosen wisely is what makes us most human.

'We make horrible mistakes, it's how we learn. We breathe love, it's how we learn, and it is inevitable.' 

Zara's posts come after a source revealed to MailOnline that a tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity.

The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.
