A mum has declared she scored the 'best birthday present ever' after a Lotto ticket she received from her husband yielded her a $4million windfall.

The Melbourne woman held one of the five division one winning entries nationally in TattsLotto's $20million Superdraw on Saturday.

Each division one winning entry took home a prize of $4 million. 

'My hubby gave me this ticket as a birthday present,' the mother, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Lott.

'We don't play that often, but on a whim he went into the store and got me this ticket. He must have been in the right place at the right time.

'When he gave it to me he said 'This ticket will make you happy' as a joke. So I handed it back to him on Sunday and said 'Happy Father's Day to you honey, this ticket will make you very happy too'. 

'We work really hard for our money, so this will go a long way.' 

The thrilled mum revealed that the winning ticket was the best gift she'd ever received. 

'It still doesn't feel real. I won't believe it until I see it in my bank account. Then I think it will feel really really real.'

She said part of the money would go towards a kitchen renovation and a tropical family holiday once international borders open. 

'I've been wanting to do it ever since we moved into the house but having the money to do it was an unobtainable goal. It would have taken me 15 years to save that much.

'Some people might think with that amount of money I could buy a whole new house, but I think I'll start with a whole new kitchen.

'I've always wanted to take the family on holiday somewhere where we can relax.

'Somewhere we can sit on a tropical island and just do nothing.'  

The winning entry was purchased at newsXpress Melton, in Melbourne's west.

NewsXpress employee Gaurav Joshi said it's the first time the store has sold a division one winning entry since taking ownership six months ago. 

'We will be telling all of our customers about the win and decorating the store with balloons and banners to celebrate the fantastic news,' he said.
