She revealed she's expecting her first child with boyfriend Matt Sarsfield last month. 

And pregnant Charlotte Dawson appeared in great spirits as she treated herself to McDonald's at one of the fast food restaurant's Manchester branches earlier this week. 

The Ex On The Beach star, 27, enjoyed a relaxing ride around the English city in Missguided's Rolls Royce, where insiders claimed she was in final discussions for her very own maternity collection with the brand.

Cradling her growing baby bump, the mother-to-be opted for comfort in a blue jumper dress, which she paired with cycling shorts and perspex heels. 

Switching into a second outfit, the Celebs Go Dating star looked radiant in an animal print dress, which was toned down with nude peep-toe stilettos. 

The daughter of late comedian Les Dawson upped the style ante by accessorising her look with a elegant watch and circular-framed shades.

While her tresses were won in bouncy curls, Charlotte accentuated her beauty with dewy foundation, fluttery false lashes and pale pink lipgloss.

On her rumoured edit, a source told MailOnline: 'Charlotte's skyrocketed in popularity over lockdown and since she announced her pregnancy brands have been fighting to sign her up for an exclusive contract.

'Her humour and relatability make her the perfect match for her own collection and her nearly 1 million followers on Instagram are the perfect audience to target. Charlotte loves fashion and is so excited and the prospect of her own line.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Charlotte and Missguided for further comment. 

Just a few weeks ago, the reality star revealed she's 'over the moon' to be expecting a baby with the rugby league player, 28, and is due to give birth just a week before what would have been her father Les' 90th birthday in February 2021. 

Oh baby! The media personality revealed she's expecting her first child with boyfriend Matt Sarsfield last month 

The comedian passed away from a heart attack aged just 62 when she was just eight months old. 

She told OK! magazine: 'We went for the first scan and my due date is actually the week before, but there's every chance I could give birth on his birthday. What a tribute that would be.'

She added: 'He would've been the best grandfather. It's bittersweet because he would have been here, making everyone laugh.'
