Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder's highly-anticipated trilogy fight has provisionally been pencilled in for December 19, says promoter Bob Arum. 

A third bout between the pair is set to materialise after Wilder made it known he wishes to exercise his rematch clause, following the first defeat of his career against Fury in February. 

Before the coronavirus pandemic, the rematch had been scheduled for mid-July but now, Arum is confident of the fight being held before the year is out at the brand new Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.

Boxing promoter Bob Arum believes the trilogy fight will take place before the year is out

'That's what we're moving ahead on, on all fronts, with the security, with the virus, and everything,' Arum said, as reported by ESPN. 

'We're talking with everybody here in town, with the [Las Vegas] Raiders. So we're optimistic that we'll be able to do the event in Nevada, in Las Vegas.' 

The brand new 65,000-capacity Allegiant Stadium opened this year and will play host to the relocated Las Vegas Raiders in the NFL this season.

Arum is hopeful for at least 10,000-15,000 spectators being allowed into the stadium for the fight, with the return of crowds in sports arenas on the agenda amid the COVID-19 crisis in the next few months. 

Should Fury win, that would be a step closer to a mega all-British heavyweight unification fight against Anthony Joshua, on the assumption AJ beats mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev in the meantime. 

A two-fight 'financial agreement' between the two British heavyweights was agreed earlier this year.  

Fury was absolutely dominant against Wilder during their second fight this year 

Fury and Wilder's first fight was a draw in December 2018 in Los Angeles, despite Wilder knocking Fury down twice in the fight. 

The Brit rose from the canvas on both occasions though and many feel he was in the end hard done by not to win on points. 

But there was no guessing who the clear winner was earlier this year, when the Gypsy King put on a performance of a lifetime to beat Wilder, with his corner throwing in the towel during the seventh round.
