The Bachelorette couple Taite Radley and Ali Oetjen announced their split in July, after two years of dating.

And while the couple insisted it was a mutual decision at the time, rumours are swirling that there may have been more to the break-up than meets the eye.

However, Taite shut down this baseless speculation on Tuesday, insisting that he and Ali, 34, parted ways amicably and remain friends.

The 29-year-old gym owner also denied unsubstantiated rumours there was a third party involved in their break-up.

'Ali and I just split up as we went different ways,' he told the So Dramatic podcast.

'Sometimes I guess life has different plans. We still chat a lot though, which is good.'

Ali and Taite announced their split on July 25, confirming that they were 'taking time apart' and giving each other 'some space'.

The pair, who met on The Bachelorette in 2018, said that they still loved each other and didn't rule out a possible reconciliation.

At the time, fans speculated that Ali and Taite had split due to the coronavirus pandemic, which had forced them to live apart for 88 days.

'It's this damn pandemic, the stress is bringing out the worst in all of us,' one follower commented on Instagram below Ali's break-up post.

'Don't worry, you and your man will reconnect once all this crap is over.'

Another added: 'Very sad news - sorry to hear this. Distance and time apart is not an easy thing for a relationship.'
