A woman who casually watched a video on her phone while driving and laughed about it when caught out is facing a $533 fine after police tracked her down.

The Queenslander, 25, from Broadbeach, was filmed by a passenger of another vehicle watching her phone on the car's dashboard while perched up over the steering wheel.

She was travelling from Bermuda St at Burleigh Waters to Bundall - about 9km away - with the phone seemingly blocking her view of the car's speedometer.

Witness Jayden Barta, who filmed the incident, said he was 'appalled' by her behaviour.

She appeared to be distracted by her phone for more than 5km, he told Nine News.  

'When she looked at us she just laughed and kept going on - her eyes glued to the screen,' he said.

'You're not only putting yourself in that much danger, you're putting everyone else in danger.' 

Police were able to track the woman down after Mr Barta passed his recording onto Crimestoppers.

She was located within less than 24 hours and will face a $533 fine.

Drivers in Queensland travelling without due care and attention risk being fined this amount.

Queensland Police officer Geoff Sheldon told Nine News: 'Anything that takes your attention off the road has the capability of killing someone.' 

Daily Mail Australia reached out to Mr Barta for comment.
