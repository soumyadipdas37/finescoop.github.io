New Manchester City signing Nathan Ake has revealed that he is looking forward to the challenge that awaits him following his £40million switch from Bournemouth.

Ake was relegated from the Premier League with Bournemouth at the end of last season but still received praise for some of his individual performances. 

The 25-year-old stressed that he has already proved that he has the talent to succeed at the highest level.

Ake told The Mirror: 'I have not signed for City thinking I can prove all the critics wrong. I have already proved to myself that I have the ability to play at top level – and I love a challenge. 

'I showed that when I was a kid playing in my hometown in the Hague and I moved to ­Rotterdam to join Feyenoord. I showed it again when I packed my stuff and moved to Chelsea.

'I have had to work incredibly hard to make it to the top – and I know I am ready. I have also achieved my dream of playing for Holland.'

The Dutch international revealed that he struck up an 'instant connection' with Pep Guardiola

Ake revealed that he found it difficult to believe that City wanted to sign him.

The centre-back added that he struck up an 'instant connection' with manager Pep Guardiola.

Ake said: 'I had to pinch myself in the arm. I was thinking, 'Is this real?'.

'When I heard they wanted me to come to Manchester I was bowled over.

'Manchester City are one of the best clubs in the world and Pep Guardiola is one of the best managers in the world.

'I had a really good talk with Guardiola and there was an instant connection. The way City play really suits me. I have played against them so many times and I know how hard it is to face them.' 

Ake's first Premier League appearance for City could come on September 21, when Guardiola's side commence their campaign away to Wolves.

Having joined Chelsea as a youngster, Ake featured for the Blues at first-team level but was loaned out on three occasions, with the last of those spells being with Bournemouth before he made a permanent move.

In total he played 121 times for the Cherries, and he will now get the opportunity to test himself in the Champions League with City.
