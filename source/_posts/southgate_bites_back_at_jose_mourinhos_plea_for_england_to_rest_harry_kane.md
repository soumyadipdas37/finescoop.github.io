Gareth Southgate has hit back at Jose Mourinho's recent comments regarding the need to rest key players during the international break, ahead of a frantic Premier League campaign.

Last season Tottenham were badly hit by injuries at a key part in the campaign, and were left without talisman Harry Kane for the latter stages of the run-in. Now, Mourinho is clearly fearing history repeating itself as England prepare for a triple bill of fixtures with limited rest.

Mourinho has aimed jibes in the direction of the England team regarding the treatment of Kane ahead of a busy run of fixtures for the Three Lions, though Southgate has taken the thinly veiled criticism in his stride.

Mourinho made sure to make his opinion known regarding captain Harry Kane's fitness

Mourinho publicly made the point that he did not start Kane against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, and used this to send a message to England by saying: 'When Kane is fit he should start every game for Tottenham but he didn’t [against Chelsea],'

He added: 'So I think this is the point. When you have such a player and you want to win every match, you play him, but you just can’t do it.

Southgate responded to Mourinho by saying it is his duty to keep Kane safe from injury

'I don’t speak with Gareth or Steve [Holland, assistant manager]. I just let them do the job in the way they want to do it with the freedom they deserve. 

'Hopefully Gareth and Steve understand what happened with Tottenham this week and they respect the players. That’s just my hope but I’m not going to call or ask or beg,' Mourinho added.

Responding during a press conference on Thursday, Southgate said: 'All Jose needs to do in April and May is he's got to look after Harry Kane for us because there will be 55 million people relying on that.

'Jose was on great form, I heard him. He won't phone but he will stand on the top of Tottenham's stadium and tell us, so that was good. 

'I'm upset I am not one of his friends I know Steve [Holland] is but in fairness he helped him to a title so that's understandable', Southgate added with a smile.

'We're certainly not looking to start players in three games.

'I can't guarantee that no player will play no minutes of all three games. You might end up having to put someone on for five minutes and then people will be saying "well you didn't do what you said."'

Mourinho is desperate to avoid a repeat of last season when Kane was sidelined for months

'But our aim is to manage the squad, we've got to be responsible we're conscious of the wellfare of the players. This season as a whole is a huge challenge for clubs and national teams so we've got to work together on that.

'It doesn't help anybody if we're not joined up on our thinking.' 

Southgate is expected to recall a number of senior stars who missed the September camp and Nations League clashes because of injury.

Said players include Chelsea new boy Ben Chilwell and his former Leicester team-mate James Maddison, along with another of Mourinho's Spurs players in Harry Winks.

Marcus Rashford is also set to return, while defender Harry Maguire is poised to be included for the first time since his summer arrest on the holiday island of Mykonos.

Youngsters Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden are still to be omitted from the squad, following their shameful antics in the aftermath of England's victory over Iceland last month.
