Jeff Brazier compared a photo of son Freddie starting his final year of secondary school alongside a picture of him on his first day on Instagram on Thursday.  

And Jeff, 41, has shared some sage words of advice with other parents as he reflected on how his youngest son, 15, has changed over the years. 

TV star Jeff, who is also dad Bobby, 17, from his relationship with the late Jade Goody, said 'Stop stressing, putting all of that unnecessary, unhelpful pressure on yourself to make your kids into something you’re picturing in your head.

Wise words: Jeff advised parents to stop 'putting all of that unnecessary, unhelpful pressure' on their kids in a heartfelt post 

'We give them the tools, they ultimately decide what to do with them.  

He continued: 'Focus on being a great example, they notice everything you do but if you do, a mistake for you can be a valuable education for them so it’s ok!'

Jeff then told parents he has found it can be beneficial to give kids freedom to plan their own schedules.  







'Hardest thing to do is watch your children making mistakes': Jeff has clearly learned a lot being a parent to his two young boys 

He wrote: 'The ability to set targets, plan next steps and take ownership of what they do, why they do it and how long they do it for is exactly what we do as adults so let’s give them some of that responsibility/trust now.' 

Finally, he said it is important for children to sometimes make mistakes.  

'It’s so inevitable they will mess up.. Be there to ensure the lesson was caught but don’t clean the mess up for them or no responsibility will be taken in future.

'We can make things ‘too easy’ when maybe the experience we’re aiming to create should be fair and realistic to what lie ahead.' 

All grown up: Jeff has previously said he is 'hugely proud' of Freddie and Bobby, who have grown into 'wonderful young men'

Last year Jeff Brazier opened up about the decade since his ex-wife Jade Goody's death, admitting that things at times had been 'tremendously difficult'. 

In the same interview, with Barrow-in-Furness based paper The Mail, he went on to say that his sons were 'coming of age' and 'have grown into wonderful young men' adding that he's 'hugely proud of them.' 

Jeff has been married to PR director Kate Dwyer since 2018, with the two of them raising Freddie and Bobby together.
