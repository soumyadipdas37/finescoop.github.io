Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has hailed new arrival Kai Havertz's attitude but stressed that the Germany international must be given time to settle in England.

Havertz joined Chelsea from Bayer Leverkusen for £90million last week and much is expected from him in his first season in the Premier League.

Lampard is excited about the qualities that Havertz can bring to Chelsea but is wary not to expect too much from the 21-year-old straight away. 

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has revealed he has been impressed by Kai Havertz's attitude

Lampard told Chelsea's official website: ‘Kai is a really exciting signing for myself and for the club first and foremost.

‘We also have to understand that he is a fantastic young talent but we must give him time to let him settle and let those talents come through.'

Lampard has also been impressed with Havertz's attitude since his arrival at the club's Cobham training ground. 

Lampard said: ‘On his personality, I have been absolutely overwhelmed with how humble and down to earth he is, and how well he wants to do here, and how he is very excited with the challenge. He wants to come here and be a top player for Chelsea, and really prove his talents on this stage.'

Lampard praised Havertz but warned not to expect too much of the Germany star immediately

Havertz, who can play as an attacking midfielder, up front or out wide, is similar to former Chelsea player Michael Ballack in terms of physique according to Lampard.

He said: 'He has great talent on the ball, his productivity is brilliant in terms of goalscoring and assists, and physically he is great in terms of how he can get around the pitch, and talking about his size we are comparing him to Michael Ballack. 

'All those things come together but I emphasise we do need to give him time, but I am really excited about what he can do.'

Havertz made a major impact for Leverkusen last season, scoring 12 goals and provided six assists across 30 Bundesliga appearances.

There have been a host of other arrivals at Chelsea during this transfer window, with Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva also joining the club.

Chelsea are eager to make further signings too, with Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy reportedly close to joining for £20m.
