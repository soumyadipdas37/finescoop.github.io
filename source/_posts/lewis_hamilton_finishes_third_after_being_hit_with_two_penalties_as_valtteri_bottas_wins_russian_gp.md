Lewis Hamilton’s quest to match Michael Schumacher’s 91 race wins was wrecked by a 10-second penalty in the Russian Grand Prix.

The world champion, who started on pole, was stymied before the race began, when he staged two practice starts on an ‘undesignated’ area, by the pit lane exit.

With the race only a few laps old, the stewards imposed a five-second penalty for each of the infringements.

Lewis Hamilton could only finish third at the Russian Grand Prix after being hit with two five-second time penalties

The penalties related to making a practice start in the wrong area as he took to the grid before the race on Sunday

Hamilton was furious, calling the decision ‘bull****’ and asking: ‘Where’s that in the rulebook?’

Since he asked: ‘FIA International Sporting Code Article 12.1.1 (i), failure to follow the instructions contained in the Event Notes (v3) item 19.1, practice start location and Article 36.1 FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations.’

It appeared a tough call, of course, and silly and bossy, but it was unavoidable given the rules as they are written.

The stewards watched video evidence before reaching their verdict.

Valtteri Bottas capitalised on Hamilton's error by winning to keep alive his slim hopes of winning the world championship 

The punishment denied the Briton probable victory – with Valtteri Bottas, his Mercedes team-mate, registering his second win of the season. Max Verstappen, of Red Bull, was second, and Hamilton third.

It was an anti-climactic end to a weekend where all the excitement had centred on Schumacher’s landmark 91 wins. It was also harsh on Hamilton, for he had asked his pit wall experts if he was OK to do the practice starts where he did. He was told yes by race engineer Peter Bonnington.

Later, when news of the punishment was broken to Hamilton, he was furious, asking: ‘What happened?’

Mercedes brought him in, earlier than he wanted, after 16 of 53 laps, for new tyres and he served his time in hokey there and then. ‘This is just ridiculous, man,’ he said as he sat it out.

He emerged in 11th place, more than half a minute back from Bottas, his chances of victory well and truly over.

He moaned about his lot. ‘Why did you stop me so early?’ he asked. ‘I’ll have to manage (my tyres). I’ll struggle to make it to the end.’

And told of Verstappen’s latest time, he snapped: ‘I don’t want any more info, Bono. It doesn’t make any difference.’

He at least escaped with just one penalty point on his licence for each illegal start, taking him to 10 in the calendar year. Two for each would have taken him to 12 and a one-race ban.

He now has to watch his Ps and Qs in the next four races – Germany, Imola, Portugal, Turkey – before his first points are wiped.

Prior to the kerfuffle, Hamilton had driven well. Passed briefly by Bottas using the drag into the second corner of the race, he then reclaimed the lead on the outside of the next bend.

A safety car came out after McLaren’s Carlos Sainz and Racing Point’s Lance Stroll crashed on the opening lap. Hamilton managed the restart well, maintaining the lead that in the end counted for little.

Yet he leads from Bottas by 44 points after 10 of 17 races.

 

Host commentator

Hamilton's pre-race error has handed his team-mate victory with the Brit finishing third behind Bottas and Verstappen.

4. Perez

5. Ricciardo

6. Leclerc

7. Ocon

8. Kvyat

9. Gasly

10. Albon

LAP 51/53: Proof that Bottas was simply cruising? He responds to Verstappen's charge by setting a new fastest lap. Hamilton is running in a very lonely third place.

LAP 50/53: Verstappen has got the gap down to Bottas to under six seconds - it's all too little too late though for Red Bull to have a decent chance of winning this race.

LAP 49/53: Albon does eventually get past Norris who on well beaten up tyres pits before emerging in 15th behind Raikkonen. A day to forget for McLaren after Sainz's opening lap retirement to add as well.

LAP 48/53: Verstappen continues to close in on Bottas, who I suspect is just easing his Mercedes home now. The gap is now eight seconds as the Dutchman sets a new fastest lap.

LAP 47/53: Gasly is looking very quick on those newer tyres, and he is now past Norris to reclaim ninth.

LAP 46/53: Cracking fight for ninth. Norris holds off Albon and Gasly with excellent defensive driving and in the end the Frenchman drives around the outside of the driver who replaced him at Red Bull to take tenth. That would have felt good for Gasly. "Oh Yeah" he says over the team radio.

LAP 43/53: Verstappen has taken a nibble into Bottas's lead, but it's no more than that - dropping to just under 11 seconds,

LAP 42/53: As a very brief virtual safety car is called, so marshalls can replace mandatory barriers, Gasly pits to drop him out of the points. Strange call, that. Have AlphaTauri misjudged that? He is down to 11th behind Alex Albon's Red Bull.

LAP 41/53: Hamilton's bid for second is also looking bleak now, he is eight seconds behind Verstappen but isn't making much inroad into the Red Bull.

LAP 40/53: Granted, that Ferrari is rubbish this year, but does Vettel have any excuse to be behind the Alfa Romeo of Antonio Giovinazzi - a customer team to Ferrari? His team-mate is running in sixth.

LAP 39/53: Your top 10 now we have seen the pit-stops and time penalties:

1. Bottas, 2. Verstappen, 3. Hamilton, 4. Perez, 5. Ricciardo, 6. Leclerc, 7. Ocon, 8. Kvyat, 9. Gasly, Norris.

LAP 37/53: What I didn't take into account with Raikkonen was that he still had to pit! Having now changed his tyres he drops to 16th behind Sebastian Vettel, who is getting a bit too familiar with these lower order finishes now.

LAP 36/53: Some better news for Hamilton. He has also been given a penalty point for his second infringement, but that means he only has 10 points in total and he will avoid a one-race ban. 

LAP 34/53: And now Gasly is past. The Finn though is still looking good for a world championship point, although 11th place Lando Norris is just a couple of seconds behind.

LAP 33/53: A solid drive for Kimi Raikkonen by the way, he is running in ninth for Alfa Romeo on the day he equals the record for the most starts in F1. He is coming under pressure from Pierre Gasly in the AlphaTauri though.

LAP 32/53: Barring mechanical gremlins or driver error, Bottas has this race won. He comfortably leads Verstappen by over 12 seconds

LAP 31/53: Breaking: One penalty point for Hamilton's first infringement. in relation to Jonathan's point from around Lap 23.

LAP 29/53: That 91st win for Hamilton looks gone this afternoon but he could still get second. Right now he is tucked up behind Kvyat, who has just pitted as I type.

Hamilton is up to third then, seven seconds behind Verstappen and 20 behind race leader Bottas,

LAP 28/53: In comes Leclerc for his stop, allowing Verstappen back into second. The Ferrari driver emerges in seventh just ahead of Ocon.

LAP 27/53: No surprises there. Ricciardo is hit with a five-second penalty for running wide in turn two trying to pass Ocon.

LOVE. THIS.RENAULT: "You have a five-second penalty for the Turn 2 incident" 🎧RICCIARDO: "OK. I'll drive faster" 🎧RENAULT: "Cheers buddy" 🎧#RussianGP 🇷🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/o6uHYKP8CD

LAP 26/53: Bottas and Verstappenpit, but while the former maintains the lead, the Dutchman comes out in fourth behind Leclerc and Kvyat.

LAP 25/53: I've seen cleaner organised overtakes. Renault allow Daniel Ricciardo to pass Estebn Ocon for eighth place but in doing so he runs wide into turn two. By doing so he should veer away and go around a designated bollard, something he does't do. I won't be surprised to see him pick up a five-second penalty for that.

LAP 24/53: Hamilton is now up to fifth behind Daniil Kvyat in fourth and Charles Leclerc in third, but he is angry under that crash helmet,

He claims the team brought him in too early for his pit-stop, but they insist it was to cover an undercut from a rival driver.

'We wait to see if Lewis is handed penalty points for his infringements. He is currently on eight points. If he were to get points today that take him to 12, he would be banned for the next race in Germany. Nobody has yet been banned since this procedure was introduced.'

LAP 17/53Hamilton pits from P1, and serves his two five-second penalties on the stop ⏱️He rejoins behind Sebastian Vettel in P10 #RussianGP 🇷🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/K4vjaq3cf2

LAP 21/53: Meanwhile Bottas leads comfortably from Verstappen with a gap of over seven seconds to the Dutchman, Mercedes are once again in a league of their own,

LAP 19/53: He is already past Vettel an pit-stops elsewhere means he is now up to sixth. He is looking good for a podium finish at least.

LAP 18/53: Why didn't Hamilton just serve the time penalty after the race? Well, he has been asking his team the same question and the answer he is given is because he changed tyres, which means he had to serve it in the pit-lane.

LAP 17/53: The answer is 11th and behind Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari. He is on the hard compound but many of the cars in front of him do have to pit.

LAP 16/53: What do I know? Hamilton pits for his stop and his 10-second penalty, where will he come out?

LAP 15/53: A new fastest lap from Hamilton, who now leads Bottas by over two seconds. He isn't pitting anytime soon by the looks of it...

LAP 14/53: Mercedes come into the pit-lane to try and service Hamilton's car... excepts he stays out and sets a fastest lap instead. Lewis still thinks there is life in his tyres, and he appears to be justified.

LAP 13/53: Hamilton has been told to up the pace by his team, to try and start clearing cars for a pit-stop.

LAP 12/53: Hamilton's victory is far from certain, but this is not a Monza type of situation where he ends up nowhere. SHould he serve the penalty now, he would probably come out just behind Charles Leclerc in eighth 

LAP 11/53: Contrary to my reporting a few moments ago, it does look like Hamilton will be able to serve the penalty as one 10-second stop in the pit-lane.

LAP 10/53: Hamilton is fuming as he is informed of his penalty, claiming "where is that in the rulebook". It doesn;t look like he has much defence however. Just pure frustration from the world champion.

LAP 9/53: His lead is over a second from Bottas right now, with Verstappen a further second down.

LAP 8/53: He can choose to serve one in the pit-stop and one to be added to his time after the race, but he cannot serve both at the same time.

LAP 7/53: Hamilton has been hit with TWO penalties for that pre-race breach of practising a start outside the designated area. That means he has two five-second penalties.

LAP 6/53: Hamilton leads away and maintains his lead into turn one. All good for the world champion

LAP 5/53: The safety car is in on this lap now the debris from Sainz and Stroll's crash has been cleared.

LAP 1/53Carlos Sainz was forced wide after the start - and hit the edge of the wall as he tried to rejoin the track 👀💥#RussianGP 🇷🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/SYczEWyUzD

LAP 4/53: Your top 10: Hamilton Bottas, Verstappen, Ocon Ricciardo, Perez, Gasly, Leclerc, Magnussen, Grosjean

LAP 3/53: Pleased to confirm that Sainz and Stroll are ok... which is not what I can say about their respective McLaren and Racing Point cars.

LAP 2/53: A poor start from Verstappen who after being passed by Bottas into turn one was forced off at turn two, but he retains third.

Sainz did the same thing, but trying to rejoin the track clipped the wall.

LAP 1/53: Great start from Valtteri Bottas who passes Max Verstappen for second and nearly Hamilton for the lead!

He goes around Lewis into turn two but can't hold the position as the Brit responds to retake the lead.

Carlos Sainz and Lance Stroll ave both crashed though and that brings out the safety car.

Hamilton is still under investigation by the way, but he will start from pole position which could leave him vulnerable to the slipstream into turn one. Expect all the drivers to be one stopping.

But there is an Indian summer in Sochi, with air temperatures in the high 20s.

It's been stunning all weekend in Sochi and race day is no different 👀Perfect conditions for some F1 racing! ☀️#RussianGP 🇷🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/7FlGJqxSVl

By leaving enough room for drivers to get past on his left-hand side while practising his start on the exit of the pit-lane, this covers him from any punishment. So as you were, Lewis on pole.

How time flies. It doesn't feel that long ago since he burst on the scene in the Sauber in 2001. F1 has come a long way since then.

322nd race start for Kimi 😮Today, he matches the all-time record of @rubarrichello 👏#RussianGP 🇷🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/8d38gaWJcq

And here's a look at the revised grid 👀Under two hours to lights out ⏲️#RussianGP 🇷🇺 #F1 pic.twitter.com/fTncmurwSJ

Charles Leclerc squeezing on the grid in tenth is the best they could hope for qualifying, and it looks like he and team-mate Sebastian Vettel are already interested in taking up a career in another sport. It is transfer season in football after all...

Only F1 can produce high drama before it even gets underway. Lewis Hamilton has made what looks like a practice start outside of the designated zone on the exit of the pitlane and he is under investigation by the stewards...

But only just! He was mere seconds away from being eliminated at one stage as we look back on yesterday's action.

Another pole position in Sochi yesterday, he looks well on course to win again in Russia and with it equal Michael Schumacher's tally of 91 grand prix victories.

Good afternoon all and welcome to our live coverage of the Russian Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton will start on pole as he aims to draw level with Michael Schumacher's 91 career wins at the Russian Grand Prix.

In a dramatic qualifying session on Saturday, Hamilton once again set the fastest time as Max Verstappen pipped Valtteri Bottas to second.
