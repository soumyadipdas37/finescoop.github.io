A knife-wielding man has been shot by police in front of shocked shoppers as a horrified witness described the scene. 

The terrifying encounter occurred outside of Lilydale Market in northeast Melbourne around 8.30am on Tuesday morning.

A woman named Pauline witnessed the tense scene on her morning walk and described the incident in a dramatic radio interview.  

'He's decided to walking through the carpark, there are guns drawn and they're yelling at him to put the knife down... there are three of them with guns drawn,' she told 3AW.

Victoria Police were forced to shoot the knife-wielding man in the car park of Lilydale Market (pictured), just after 8.30am on Tuesday morning after he refused to drop the weapon 

Pauline said the man was 'brandishing a large knife' outside of Chemist Warehouse and was 'just wandering around' before beginning to walk away from the centre.  

She described the standoff and said police were backing up with their guns drawn and holding pepper spray and tasers.

Pauline said she could see at least five police officers, several police cars and an ambulance before multiple shots were heard in the background. 

'Oh s*** they're shooting, they've just shot. I can't see if they've shot him but there's just been three or four rounds... It looks like they've taken him down.

'I can't see if they've actually shot him, but there's a lot of police scurrying around right now,' she said.

Pauline said a special operations police squad arrived on the scene as an ambulance approached the man in the carpark.   

Victoria Police were called to the marketplace at about 8.30am after 'a man armed with an edged weapon' was reported on Hutchinson Street.
