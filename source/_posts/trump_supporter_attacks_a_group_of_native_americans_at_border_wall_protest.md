Kumeyaay land lies between San Diego and Baja California in Mexico. 

According to an Instagram post written by the group, the woman had also tried to tear down their tent. 

'You're being recorded,' one of the group members tells the irate woman in the video. She replies 'I don't give a f***,' as she lunges at the woman recording the scene.  

The peaceful protesters respond in a non-violent manner and attempt to restrain the woman. 

Later in the footage, as the group begin praying to their ancestors and singing and chanting, the Trump supporter appears to mock them by hoppinh around and mimicking their Native American dance rituals.

'We used songs and prayers again just like how we non violently stop desecration to the land.'
