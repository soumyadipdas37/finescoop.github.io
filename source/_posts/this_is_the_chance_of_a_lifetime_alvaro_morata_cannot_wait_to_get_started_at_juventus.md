Alvaro Morata has hailed his return to Juventus as 'the chance of a lifetime' and believes new coach Andrea Pirlo can guide the Turin giants to Champions League glory.

Juventus have signed the former Chelsea and Real Madrid striker on a one-season loan from Atletico Madrid for €10million (£9m). 

The agreement also gives Juve an option to buy the 27-year-old Spaniard at the end of the season for €45m (£40.5m) to be paid over three years.

Morata spent two years at the Turin club from 2014 to 2016 before joining Chelsea for a then club record €60m.

At his official unveiling on Friday, he told football-italia.net: 'Being back here is great. I'm now a more experienced person and player. 

'This is the chance of a lifetime.

'Seeing Pirlo as a coach has been great. I saw it coming because he was made to be one. Juve need him and I'm happy to be here with him.

'After the first two training sessions, I was already impressed with how he managed the group. He knows how to get us to play well with the ball.

'I'm sure we'll do well. I'm ready to play and do whatever the coach asks of me. I want to win and I'd like to score 35 goals.

'I've always said that my dream was to play for Atletico Madrid, but they were banking on me here when I was a still a young lad, so I'm very grateful.

'I'm at the right place at the right time. The best memory of when I was here is my wife, in addition to the trophies I won, which are unforgettable.'

Morata reunites with Cristiano Ronaldo, his strike partner at Real Madrid.

'I know Cristiano well, both as a player and as a person. I always had a good relationship with him. He told me that he was happy I came here.

'It wasn't my decision to leave the first time. A contract must be respected. Before returning, I talked to everyone and saw that there was this possibility.

'I was happy at Atletico, I won't forget what I did for them, but now I'm here and that's the most important thing.

'I've always felt the faith of his club, even when I wasn't here.'
