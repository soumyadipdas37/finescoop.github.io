Christmas has come early to Coles with the launch of its festive bakery collection.

Now available in stores Australia-wide, the 11-piece range includes old favourites like the 'CHOICE Recommended' Christmas pudding and new additions like mince pies stuffed with blackcurrant and apple.

Classic mince pies have been upgraded with a new and improved recipe that promises 'even more juicy fruit and an attractive shortcrust pastry star design'.

And with prices ranging from $2 to $7, the range is sure to be welcomed by budget-conscious customers who can buy every product for a reasonable $26.

After shifting a staggering one million mince pies in September 2019 alone, Coles is hoping to smash last year's sales record by getting in early with shoppers.

Coles Bakery Manager Rosie Anderson said the release date - almost four months ahead of Christmas Day - was brought forward to bring hope to coronavirus-weary customers as the pandemic rolls on.

'We've been working hard to bring a timely festive bakery collection to stores early to help raise the spirits of those Australians who need it most,' Ms Anderson told Nine News.

And Coles aren't the only iconic Australian brand getting into the festive spirit a little earlier than usual.

On August 27, hardware giant Bunnings rolled out a collection of Christmas lights to brighten the mood amid COVID-19.

The range - exclusively available in select stores - includes pink reindeer, fibre optic trees and giant Nutcracker soldiers that stand over a metre high.

An employee from the Craigieburn outlet, 25km from Melbourne CBD, announced the launch with a Facebook photo that's gone viral since it was posted on Tuesday night.

'After the year we've had, bushfires and a pandemic (and our metro Melbourne folk still getting through), looking forward to seeing lots of seasonal lighting,' she wrote in the caption.

It's not clear which other stores are stocking the festive collection, which does not appear on the brand's website because they are promotional items.

On social media, the excitement was evident.

'Eekkk! That makes me happy! Especially as we are hosting family Christmas this year and I wanted to get a head start!! Thank you!' one person said. 

Another added: 'We need something cheerful, that's for sure! I think I need to get into the festive spirit this year.'

But some felt the launch was premature, even against the backdrop of the pandemic.

'Gosh Christmas stuff already, it's not even September yet,' one woman said.

A second said: 'Christmas decs (sic) already.. Oh my god, yes I love Christmas but why can't they wait until October at least?'

A third was more outspoken in her criticism.

'No!!! Halloween needs to come first. Hate b****y Christmas. Worst time of year,' she said.

'People turn into monsters and become so greedy - completely missing the whole point. Anyway, that's my whinge.'
