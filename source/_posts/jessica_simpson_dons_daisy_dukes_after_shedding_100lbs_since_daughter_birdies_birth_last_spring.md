Jessica Simpson showed off her stellar figure as she slipped into a pair of Daisy Dukes while modeling her latest clothing collection with her daughter Birdie. 

The 40-year-old singer/actress-turned-entrepreneur/author radiated confidence in the sassy Southern look, pairing her tiny shorts with a tie-up top that flashed a hint of her toned center.

Jessica was proud to flaunt her body, charming the camera after shedding over 100lbs since the birth of her baby girl in March 2019.

It was hard to believe it's been a full 15 years since she made jaws drop playing Daisy Duke herself.

Her dark denim shorts hugged her hips, skimming high up her thighs to reveal maximum amounts of leg.

Up top, Jessica continued to sizzle in a yellow checkered top which put both her midriff and her cleavage front-and-center.

Never afraid of a bit of glitz, Jessica piled on jewelry, adding bracelets, earrings, necklaces and a couple of eye-catching rings.

The mother-of-three was in full glam, honing her already high cheekbones with some dramatic contour and painting on a full, nude pout.

Jessica made herself comfortable on set, posing with a pea-green, vintage van and several surfboards.

She continued to stun in a second look, which was just as leggy as the first. This time, Simpson invited her girls Birdie and Maxwell, eight, along. It seemed like a girls day, as son Ace Knute, seven, wasn't present.

Mom proved she was her own best advertisement as she donned a cute brown-striped romper with fluttery sleeves.

Special: 'Holding tight to what matters most and enjoying these lasting moments of sunshine!,' her brand wrote in the caption of their Instagram

Her girls looked just as darling, clad in their own airy, summer duds from Jessica's kid's line.

'Holding tight to what matters most and enjoying these lasting moments of sunshine!,' her brand wrote in the caption of their Instagram.

The caption also revealed that the pics were taking 'at the end of last year,' meaning they didn't even show the full extent of Jessica's weight loss journey.

The wife of NFL alum Eric Johnson recently told People how 'shocked' she was last month when she discovered she fit into a pair of jeans she wore 14 years ago.

Happy lady: 'I was in complete shock,' the mother of three told the magazine. 'It was a good 40th birthday present.' Seen in August on SiriusXM

'I was in complete shock,' she told the magazine. 'It was a good 40th birthday present.'

In July she shared an image of herself to Instagram in the jeans looking proud. 

In the caption alongside the picture, Jessica wrote: 'I have kept these throwback True Religion jeans in my closet for 14 yrs (I’m not exaggerating!). I figured that since I’m in the final hours of my 30’s I’d give them another try, and hello 40, so nice to meet you.'  

Now, in September, Simpson is still marveling over the fit.

The actress added: 'I've tried to pull those things over my hips so many times. I just thought my hips, from having babies, would never go back, but the jeans went up.'

It's been quite the transformation for Jessica who was 240lbs when she was at her heaviest, after gaining 100 pounds while pregnant with Birdie, her youngest. 

'I was very open about being well over 200 pounds, on the heavy side of 200 pounds,' the singer said. 

'I’m open about my insecurities and my flaws, and if I can help inspire anybody to feel better about themselves, that’s why I’m here.'        

Now she wears jeans all the time: Seen here in August in another pair of jeans; she has said she was once 240lbs but has lost 100lbs
