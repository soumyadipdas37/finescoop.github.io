Side sleepers need a thin eye mask that's not excessively padded and - most importantly - effectively blocks out light.

There is a wide variety of sleep masks on Amazon that will help you get more and better quality rest, but if you're still searching for the perfect sleep mask you might want to check out the HOMMINI Sleep Mask.

It's the perfect time to buy as the sleep mask is currently 20 per cent off on Amazon, but you'll have to be quick to score this deal as it's discounted for one day only.

Now 20 per cent off, the HOMMINI Sleep Mask fits the curves of their face perfectly and it even comes with its own pouch and earplugs for travelling

Currently costing just £11.99, this blackout eye mask is a side-sleeper's dream. Made from breathable ultra-soft fabric, it features a thinner-than-most design and adjustable straps for a comfortable and secure fit.

Not only do shoppers say it fits the curves of their face perfectly (which helps block out light), it also allows your head to rest comfortably on its side without anything digging into your skin. And it even comes with its own pouch and earplugs for travelling.

With more than 700 reviews, Amazon shoppers praise the HOMMINI Sleep Mask, saying it has completely transformed their bedtime routines. Reviewers describe it as 'comfortable' and 'top quality', 'while blocking absolutely all light'.

'I've suffered from sleep deprivation for many years due to working shifts, one wrote in their review of the mask. 'I've tried quite a few sleep masks over that time, and I'd say this the best one to date. 

'Lightweight, comfortable and blocks out the light - a lot cheaper than blackout curtains etc.'

'I have difficulty sleeping once it starts getting light,' added another customer. 'So although I love summer, the early light really affects my sleep. So thought I'd give this sleeping mask a try after the good reviews.

'It works. It's brilliant. It fits over your eyes, so there is no pressure. It is soft and comfortable even for a front sleeper like me. Honestly, I've never had a better sleep in my life than with this mask.' 

And unlike classic sleep masks, the HOMMINI Sleep Mask has a 3D cup design that creates little to no pressure on your eyelids, which is ideal you want to preserve your eye-makeup or lash extensions when taking a quick nap.

The extra room also allows your eyes to blink freely, yet it still properly traps light, removing tension from your eyes and helping the body and nervous system to switch to night mode.
