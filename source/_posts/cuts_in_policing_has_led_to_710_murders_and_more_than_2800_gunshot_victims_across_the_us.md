Major cities across the United States are seeing a 'dramatic and widespread spike in homicides' after police funding cuts, according to one expert. 

Paul Cassell, a professor at S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah has dubbed the rise in crime the 'Minneapolis effect'. 

The city council in Minneapolis voted to dismantle the police and slash its budget after the May 25 death of black man George Floyd while in custody. 

Cassell estimates that 'as a result of de-policing during June and July 2020, approximately 710 additional victims were murdered and more than 2,800 victims were shot'.  

In research published this month Cassell wrote: 'Recently, major cities across the country have suffered dramatic spikes in homicides. These spikes are remarkably large, suddenly appearing and widespread. 

'At this rate, 2020 will easily be the deadliest year in America for gun-related homicides since at least 1999, while most other major crime categories are trending stable or slightly downward.'

He added: 'Reduced proactive policing (sometimes referred to in the academic literature 'de-policing') is the most logical explanation for the recent homicide spikes.'

A July study by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice found Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Detroit have all seen a rise in homicides, aggravated assault and gun assaults in 2020. 

The study found that 'rates of homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault began to increase significantly in late May'. 

Minneapolis has has more than 400 shooting victims and 59 homicides so far in 2020. 

Crime data from the Minneapolis Police Department shows homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, auto theft, theft from motor vehicles and arson were all up in the city so far in 2020, when compared with 2019 up until September 15.

Violent crime, including domestic aggravated assault, was up almost 15 per cent in the first nine months of the year, while property crime was up almost eight per cent in the same time period.

Of all the crimes that have increased, homicide saw the largest spike of 87 per cent, rising from 30 in 2019 to 56 in 2020, while incidents of arson have increased by 82 per cent over the total at this point in 2019.

Robbery rose from 931 to 1,275 (37 percent) while incidents of aggravated assault increased from 1,750 in 2019 to 2,100 this year (20 percent). Meanwhile, rape fell by 22 percent, and domestic aggravated assault fell by 8.4 percent.

In terms of property crimes, burglary rose from 2,223 to 2,785 (25 percent), thefts from motor vehicles rose from 3,127 to 3,937 (26 percent), and auto theft rose from 1,982 to 2,766 (40 percent), while larceny fell by almost 10 percent.

Shootings in New York City were up 166 percent last month compared to August 2019, according to police crime statistics released Wednesday.

The Big Apple has seen a troubling spike in crime and violence this year, and new data shows there were 242 shootings recorded last month. In August 2019 there were just 91 shootings recorded. The number of shootings rose in all boroughs except Staten Island.

The number of murders is also up citywide, increasing from 36 in August 2019 to 53 last month, marking a 47 percent rise. Overall, crime for August 2020 increased from 9,033 reported last year to 9,093 – a .7 percent increase. 

Cassell told Fox 9: 'I think what Minneapolis is seeing is the same thing we’re seeing all over the country. We’re seeing a reduction in proactive policing, and as a result of that homicide and shootings are skyrocketing all over the country.'

He added: 'We are seeing a stop in proactive police - stop and frisk, and vehicle stops, and things police officers have to initiate.'







In his study he wrote: 'A close analysis of the emerging crime patterns suggests that American cities may be witnessing significant declines in some forms of policing, which in turn is producing the homicide spikes. 

'Crime rates are increasing only for a few specific categories—namely homicides and shootings. These crime categories are particularly responsive to reductions in proactive policing.

Paul Cassell, a professor at S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah has dubbed the rise in crime the 'Minneapolis effect'

'The data also pinpoint the timing of the spikes to late May 2020, which corresponds with the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis and subsequent anti-police protests—protests that likely led to declines in law enforcement.

'If this thesis is correct, it is reasonable to estimate that, as a result of de-policing during June and July 2020, approximately 710 additional victims were murdered and more than 2,800 victims were shot.

'If this article’s thesis about a Minneapolis Effect is correct, an important implication is that policymakers in major cities should proceed cautiously before taking step to “defund” the police in ways that might reduce proactive policing that is important in preventing gun violence.' 

Officials in New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Portland has all approved police funding cuts.  

Just two months after voting to dismantle the police and slashing its budget, Minneapolis City Council members pressed the department's chief over a surge in crime, prompting a GOP candidate to slam the lawmakers as hypocrites.

'Residents are asking, "Where are the police?"' Council Member Jamal Osman said on Tuesday, adding that calls to the Minneapolis Police Department from constituents have gone unanswered.

'That is the only public safety option they have at the moment. MPD. They rely on MPD. And they are saying they are nowhere to be seen.'

Osman and other council members questioned police Chief Medaria Arradondo on Tuesday about the increase in crime, including daylight car jackings, robberies, assaults, shootings and street racing. 

But others noted that the council just recently slashed the police budget by $1.1million and also voted to amend the city charter that would allow for the dismantling of the entire police department. 

The hypocrisy and failure that we’re seeing from this City Council is astounding and deeply troubling,' Lacy Johnson, a GOP candidate who is running against Democratic incumbent House Rep. Ilhan Omar, told Fox News.
