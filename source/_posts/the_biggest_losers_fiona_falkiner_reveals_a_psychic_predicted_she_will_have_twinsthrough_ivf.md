Fiona Falkiner is undergoing IVF to have a baby with her fiancée Hayley Willis, and she's been documenting the journey for her fans. 

And the 37-year-old recently suffered what she thought was a devastating set back, when she thought she'd taken her hormonal medication at the wrong time. 

She said on her What The IVF podcast this week: 'I just cried all night long. I was filled with complete fear and dread and thought I had put everything in jeopardy after all we had been through. I have never beaten myself up so much'.

Luckily, the former Biggest Loser host quickly learned she'd taken the medicine at the right time. 

Fiona also says she had a 'good feeling' about her latest harvest of eggs, after a psychic told her she'd have two children - perhaps even twins. 

'I'm feeling really good this time. My mindset is much more positive than the last round. I think having two embryos rather than one helps; having a back-up lessens the pressure,' she said.

Fiona recently revealed her 'traumatic' and 'lonely' journey in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 

She told the paper: 'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'  

In the same interview, Hayley, 30, revealed that she, too, hopes to carry a baby, shortly after Fiona gives birth. 

Hayley said: 'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best.'

Fiona and Hayley announced their engagement in April 2019, after 10 months of dating each other. The couple have already purchased a house together. 

The romantic proposal took place at sunset on a private beach at The Moso resort in Vanuatu, with Hayley presenting her partner with a diamond ring.  

The two women will tie the knot later this year in an intimate wedding ceremony.   

The couple haven't announced a wedding date yet, but they've previously stated that it will be a 'low-key' ceremony with friends and family.
