Thiago Silva has hit out at Paris Saint-Germain for the manner of his departure from the club this summer, admitting it was a 'situation that p****d me off'.

The 36-year-old was keen to extend his eight-year stay in Paris this summer but was not offered a contract extension by sporting director Leonardo.

He played on during the Champions League finale - taking PSG to their first final where they were agonisingly beaten by Bayern Munich - before completing a free transfer to Chelsea.

The Brazilian defender lifted 23 trophies during a glittering eight-year stay in Paris

But he believes it was handled awkwardly and hastily after nearly a decade of service to the Ligue 1 club. 

'It's a situation that p****d me off. I really didn't like the way it was conducted', he told France Football.

'Even if there was lockdown, things should have been done differently. 

'I was in Brazil, in quarantine, when Leonardo called me to tell me that because of the pandemic and the difficulties ... [He pauses.] No, first, he asked me if I was OK to continue for two more months to compete in a possible Final 8. I told him yes.

'But he told me that the club would not go beyond these two months. It would be two months and nothing else. It should have been done differently.'

Silva lifted a staggering 23 trophies at PSG and said: 'All my career at PSG, I gave the maximum, I never cheated.

'It's as if three matches in the final eight changed everything? And everything I had achieved in those eight years didn't matter anymore? It is not consistent. 

'Leo did this in an awkward and hasty fashion. Not just with me by the way. I also think of Cavani who is the top scorer in the history of PSG. I say this so that the club progresses and does not make these kinds of mistakes in the future. '
