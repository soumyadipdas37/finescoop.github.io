Bert Newton suffered multiple health scares in recent years, including three bouts of pneumonia.

And on Monday, his wife Patti revealed the Australian TV legend, 82, has made some changes to his lifestyle.

Speaking to New Idea, the 75-year-old said Bert has 'changed' his diet and monitors what he eats.

This comes after a source claimed Bert's recent battle with pneumonia 'shook him to the core'.

'When he had a health scare with pneumonia in 2017, it shook him to the core,' an insider told the publication in April.

'He realised he was actually vulnerable and that terrified him. He knew he had a close call and had to take far better care of himself.'

Bert's health first became a concern in 2012 when he underwent a quadruple bypass.

In the years following the heart surgery, he was hospitalised three times with pneumonia and was also diagnosed with anemia.

Anemia can make a person feel tired or weak because there are not enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues.

The four-time Gold Logie winner told reporters outside hospital in 2017 that he was feeling better after being treated for pneumonia.

'I'm feeling better now. It took a while. I didn't realise until I copped it the first time, that pneumonia is such a serious thing, but I'm feeling better now,' he said.
