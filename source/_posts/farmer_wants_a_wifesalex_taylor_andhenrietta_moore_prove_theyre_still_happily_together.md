After dumping Jess Wolfe for Henrietta Moore in last month's Farmer Wants A Wife finale, Alex Taylor is still happily loved-up with the brunette beauty.

On Sunday, Henrietta shared a photo of herself standing alongside the 29-year-old farmer and friend David Freeman.

'With my two favourite farmers this morning in rainy Currumbin,' the 31-year-old teacher captioned the photo.

Both Alex and Henrietta were beaming as they wrapped their arms around each other and posed for the photo. 

In what was arguably the show's biggest twist, Alex revealed he started to see Jess, 25, as just a friend after initially choosing her over Henrietta. 

'I just kept on starting to feel that I could only see her as my friend. I couldn't see this romance blossoming that I was craving,' he explained in the show's finale, adding, 'My heart wasn't in it.'

Alex said he ultimately broke up with Jess, before teasing he still managed to find love after his stint on the show.

Henrietta then came walking down the staircase, leaving the show's other farmers and their partners visibly surprised.

'Things ended with Jess and I, and there were all of these questions still floating around,' explained Alex.

'I contacted Henrietta and we started talking again, and it just felt right. I still feel connected to her. 

'Chemistry is a hard thing to find, and that spark. You don't find it with very many people.' 

Henrietta said they never planned on getting together again romantically, agreeing to meet up 'as friends'.

'Chemistry is a hard thing to find, and that spark. You don't find it with very many people,' said Alex in the show's finale 

But she admitted it wasn't long before sparks started to fly again, and Alex said a romance between them 'felt natural'.

'We are quite different people on some level, but soulmates,' said Henrietta, before giving Alex a passionate kiss.

Added Alex: 'I feel happy and I feel confident again, and I haven't felt like that for a long time... I feel alive again.' 

'I contacted Henrietta and we started talking again, and it just felt right. I still feel connected to her,' said Alex in the show's finale
