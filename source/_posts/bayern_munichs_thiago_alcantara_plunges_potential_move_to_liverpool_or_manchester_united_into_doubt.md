Thiago Alcantara has played down rumours he is leaving Bayern Munich this summer, thereby putting a potential Premier League move into serious doubt.

The Spanish midfielder has been strongly linked with a move to either Liverpool or Manchester United this summer following intense speculation that he is set to leave the Champions League winners. 

And Thiago, who is currently on international duty with Spain ahead of their clash with Ukraine on Sunday, revealed he has not told anyone he is leaving Bayern this summer and is only focused on the Nations League campaign.

Thiago has been strongly linked with a move away from this year's Champions League winners

The 29-year-old told reporters on Saturday: 'I have not told anyone that I am leaving. Every year you (the media) put me in a different club. 

'For me my future is Sunday's game and there is no topic on this. I don't care one bit. I'm only interested in tomorrow's game.'

Thiago played 90 minutes in Spain's 1-1 draw with Germany on Thursday evening which kick started the country's international campaign for 2020. 

After the match, Germany and Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen admitted he would love the LaLiga side to resign Thiago, who left the Camp Nou for Bayern in 2013. 

The shot stopper claimed that the Spanish midfielder suits Barcelona's style of play, though Thiago poured cold water over those rumours too.

He added: 'It is an honor to hear my name, but he (Ter Stegen) is not a sporting director of any team and I don't have to give an answer. It's obviously a joy to hear my name.'

 Thiago has come off the back of a superb campaign with Bayern, who completed a sensational treble this summer, culminating in the Champions League Final win over Paris Saint-Germain in August. 

Managed by former Bayern player Hansi Flick, the Bavaria team reclaimed the Bundesliga and German Cup titles this summer with the Spaniard impressing in the heart of midfield. 

Yet the 29-year-old believes there is still more to come from Flick's side next season, ahead of the Bundesliga's return on September 18.  

Thiago said: 'It has been a wonderful season. We (Bayern) have won all the titles at club level, but there is always room for individual improvement. Every year I want to learn from my team-mates. 

The Spaniard has also been linked with a move to Liverpool and Manchester United this year

'I always think that the current moment is the best we can live in. I am physically very well. Having come from Lisbon I'm on a roll, but I think that the following year I will be better'.

Yet Thiago also hopes other teams do not pick up on Bayern's tactics and replicate them - or the German champions could expect more competition next time around. 

He claimed: 'I hope that Bayern's game does not set the trend for new football. It would be fatal for us. We want to have our way of playing and that's it. 

'In the selection we do not copy any style. It has been a long time since we last had this pressure (and) dominance (where we are) belittling the rival. 

'It's another thing to achieve it, but we always want to play like that.'
