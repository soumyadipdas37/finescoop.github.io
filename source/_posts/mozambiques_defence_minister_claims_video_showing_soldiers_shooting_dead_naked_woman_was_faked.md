Mozambique's defence minister said today a video showing men dressed in army uniforms beating and killing a naked woman is fake.

Jaime Neto pledged to have the 'malicious people' who doctored the footage paraded in front of the public and punished.

The video, circulated by multiple human rights groups on Monday, showed heavily-armed men taunting the woman and referring to her as 'al-Shabaab' - an Islamist insurgent group.

It was purportedly filmed in the gas-rich province of Cabo Delgado where the army has been locked in a vicious struggle with the jihadists since 2017.

In the video, one of the soldiers hits the victim over the head and across the body with a stick before others shoot and, they say in the video, kill her on the side of the road.  

In a statement released late on Monday, the army said it considered the images shocking and horrifying, and 'above all condemnable'.

'The FDS (Defence and Security Forces) reiterate that they do not agree with any barbaric act that substantiates the violation of human rights,' it said, calling for an investigation into the video's authenticity.

'This is quite chilling,' tweeted Amnesty International's east and southern Africa director Deprose Muchena. 'When does this end?' 

Speaking to local television on Wednesday, defence minister Neto claimed the video was faked by 'malicious people' to harm the military's image.

He did not provide further details but said that those who made the footage would be found and punished.

Troops will continue with their peace-keeping operations in the province, Neto added.

The footage comes amid allegations of abuses by government soldiers in Cabo Delgado province. 

Military forces have been struggling to regain control of the area, which is home to one of Africa's biggest liquefied natural gas projects.

Militants have launched a series of attacks on villages and towns in Cabo Delgado over the past three years, killing more than 1,500 people and displacing at least 250,000.

The group has grown bolder in recent months, escalating violence as part of a campaign to establish an Islamist caliphate.

A strategic port in the town of Mocimboa da Praia has been occupied by jihadists since August 12.

After an escalation in the insurgency, which saw the capture of the key port town in August, and the security forces' response, reports and videos of beatings or other abuses have become increasingly common.

The stinging success of Mozambique's Islamic extremist rebels in seizing and holding the northern port city signals to the government, neighboring countries and the world that Africa has yet another insurgency hotspot

Last week, Amnesty International said it had verified videos showing attempted beheadings, torture and other ill treatment of prisoners, the dismemberment of alleged opposition fighters and possible extrajudicial executions.

The government dismissed the allegations, saying insurgents regularly impersonated soldiers in an attempt to confuse national and international public opinion.

Zenaida Machado, researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for an investigation and said such acts, if committed by soldiers, sowed distrust in the population and strengthened insurgents' narrative.

'It's the worst case of betrayal,' she said, adding that frightened people should not run from insurgents only to find themselves in danger from those supposed to keep them safe.
