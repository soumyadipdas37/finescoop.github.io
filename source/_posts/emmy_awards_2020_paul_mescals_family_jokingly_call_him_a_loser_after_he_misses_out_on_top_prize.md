Paul Mescal's family jokingly called him a 'loser' after he missed out on his Lead Actor award for Normal People at the virtual 72nd Emmys ceremony on Sunday night.

The Irish heartthrob, 24, had been nominated for the top prize alongside Jeremy Irons, Hugh Jackman, Jeremy Pope and Mark Ruffalo, with the latter winning.

After the virtual ceremony, Paul's musician sister, Nell, 17, took to her Instagram Story to share a hilarious screenshot of the family FaceTiming the actor.

Family jokes: Paul Mescal's family jokingly called him a 'loser' after he missed out on his Lead Actor award for Normal People at the virtual 72nd Emmys ceremony on Sunday night 

In the snap, the star's mother was seen doing the 'loser' L-sign to her forehead while the rest of the family giggled.

While Paul appeared to have changed out of his Louis Vuitton suit and into a more casual white T-shirt. 

Nell captioned the screenshot with: 'We still love you.' 

Normal People had also been nominated for Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or Drama Special and Directing for a Limited Series, but also missed out on the prizes to Watchmen: This Extraordinary Being and Unorthodox - respectively.

Ahead of the virtual ceremony, Paul had dressed to impress in a Louis Vuitton suit as he posed on his stairs at his home in London.

Normal People's Irish star Paul, meanwhile, scored his nomination for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role as Connell, but his co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones and the BBC show were snubbed, a decision he previously insisted was 'disappointing'.  

Ahead of the ceremony, he shared uploaded the black and white snap of himself in the designer two-piece suit and wrote: 'This is nuts. I am wearing @louisvuitton on my stairs for the Emmys! Best of luck to all the nominees x'. 

Talking about his nomination and co-star Daisy's, 22, snub, Paul previously told Just Jared: 'It's disappointing because I would love to have shared that with her.'  

Nominations: Normal People had also been nominated for Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or Drama Special and Directing for a Limited Series, but also missed out on the prizes to Watchmen: This Extraordinary Being and Unorthodox - respectively  

Paul also revealed that the first person he wanted to tell about his exciting Emmy nomination was his mother but he couldn't get in touch.

He added: 'I was trying to voice call everybody on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was picking up. 

'I think they were all kind of scared. When I got everybody on the call, it was pretty amazing. My brother who never cries was crying.'

The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards took place with a largely virtual ceremony due to the pandemic on Sunday night.

Sweet: Talking about his nomination and co-star Daisy's, 22, snub, Paul told Just Jared : 'It's disappointing because I would love to have shared that with her.' (pictured in show still)  

Producers sent over 130 home video kits to stars for their remote speeches, and Jimmy Kimmel anchored the show from the Staples Centre as other presenters delivered gongs to some of the winners' homes in full tuxedo hazmat gear. 

Host Jimmy, 52, admitted the traditional glitz and glamour could end up a 'beautiful disaster' as the Emmys became the latest major awards show to grapple with holding a ceremony during a still-raging pandemic.

Choosing the comedian to emcee the ceremony reverses course from last year's no-host ceremony. 

Elsewhere, British nominees The Crown's Olivia Colman and Killing Eve's Jodie Comer, missed out on the Best Actress in a Drama Series category to Euphoria star Zendaya, 24.

Starry: Other British nominees included Succession star Brian Cox who missed out on the Lead Actor prize to his co-star Jeremy Strong 

Other British nominees included Succession stars Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen, who have scooped nominations in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor in a Drama Series categories respectively.

Brian missed out on the prize to Succession co-star Jeremy Strong while Matthew failed to take home the Supporting Actor gong to The Morning Show star Billy Crudup.

Outstanding drama series, considered by many the biggest award on the night, featured The Crown, Better Call Saul, The Handmaid's Tale, Killing Eve, The Mandalorian, Ozark, Stranger Things and Succession - with the latter show winning.
