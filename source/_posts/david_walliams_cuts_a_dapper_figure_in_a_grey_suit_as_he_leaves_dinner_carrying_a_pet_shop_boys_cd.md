David Walliams cut a dapper figure as he left dinner at Scott's restaurant in London on Thursday evening. 

The TV star, 49, looked sharp in a dark grey suit as he exited the eatery carrying the Pet Shop Boys' album Behaviour. 

David's outing comes ahead of his appearance on the pre-recorded Britain's Got Talent semi-finals.

The TV judge flashed a broad smile as he made his way down the street following an evening at the swanky eatery.

David donned a smart jacket and trousers combo, which he wore with a pale blue shirt and dark brown leather shoes.

And the comedian was clearly keen for his fun evening to continue as he was seen clutching a CD by the synth-pop duo. 

On Sunday, David joined his fellow BGT judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon to whittle down 200 acts to just 40 to appear in the ITV show's semi-finals.

Following the semi-finals, the live final will air albeit with some big changes, most notably the absence of music mogul Simon, who is recovering after breaking his back in a shock bike accident. 

He'll be replaced by Ashley Banjo, with he Diversity star, 31, - who won the ITV show in 2009 with his dance troupe - taking up the new role for the first semi-final. 

Simon told The Sun: 'Ashley will be a fantastic addition to the panel. He knows the power of the show and the responsibility of it. 

'I couldn't think of a better person to sit in my seat whilst I follow doctor's orders. I hate that stupid bike.'

Fun times: The Britain's Got Talent judge appeared in good spirits during his night out

Clearly excited about his judging gig Ashley added: 'As if 2020 couldn't get any crazier! Walking on that stage as a 20-year-old street dancer from East London and now I am walking out there and stepping in for the big man.

'It feels really nice, almost poetic.' 

Entertainment mogul Simon broke his back earlier this month after falling from his new Swind EB-01 bike at his Malibu home.

Although it had been hoped that Simon might be able to appear via video call for the already delayed shows, it has now been confirmed that he will not be seen at all.

A source told The Mirror: 'It was decided that the idea of having him judge the BGT finalists via a link was just not feasible – nor sensible.

'Everything is fixed, he just needs healing time. Flying halfway across the world is not part of the plan and he has agreed to put his health first.'

The shows have already been hit by delays due to coronavirus restrictions. Although the audition episodes were shown in April the live finals had to be postponed.

Filming has also been changed to ensure that crew and acts can remain socially distanced and there is going to be a virtual audience.

Now instead of live shows, the episodes will be pre-recorded and shown in what would have been The X Factor's prime-time Saturday night slot.

The first pre-recorded Britain’s Got Talent semi-final airs Saturday 5th September at 8pm
