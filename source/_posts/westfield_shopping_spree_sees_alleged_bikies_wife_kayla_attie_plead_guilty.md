The glamorous wife of a heavily-tattooed alleged bikie has admitted to buying a Play Station 4 and shoes with fake cash during a massive $1300 shopping spree.

Kayla Tianne Attie, 23, was out late-night shopping with two of friends in August last year when she used counterfeit cash at both EB Games and Footlocker.

CCTV from inside Westfield Eastgardens, in Sydney's south-east, captured footage of the trio - including Attie who was described as blonde and with lip fillers - carrying a number of bags out of the store about 9.30pm, having shopped for some two hours.

But after the money was found to be counterfeit, NSW Police's anti-bikie Strike Force Raptor knocked on the door of the home Attie shares with her husband and alleged Finks OMCG member Sarmad Mekhail.

The couple held hands inside the Downing Centre Local Court on Monday as Attie's lawyer Michael Moussa entered guilty pleas to one count of dishonestly obtaining property.

Kayla Tianne Attie (pictured with husband Sarmad Mekhail), 23, has admitted to using a bunch of fake cash to buy a Play Station 4 and shoes at Westfield Eastgardens in Sydney's south-east

The wife (pictured) of alleged Finks bikie gang member Mekhail allegedly spent a total $1300 at EB Games and Footlocker during a late-night shopping spree with friends last August

Attie was initially faced with five offences relating to the dodgy shopping spree, but police prosecutors did a plea deal with Mr Moussa to drop four of those charges. 

Court documents told how Attie and her two friends walked around the Eastgardens shopping centre with bundles of $100 notes in their pockets like something out of a gangster movie.

First they walked into the EB Games store about 8.40pm and handed over five of the green $100 notes for a Play Station 4.

Next they stepped into a nearby Footlocker shop where CCTV showed Attie pulling a bundle of $100 notes contained with a rubber band from her pocket.

She handed over eight of the notes, received $70 in change and left with her hands full with bags of shoes.

But more than two months later she was awoken at 6.25am to the noise of anti-bikie Strike Force Raptor banging on her door.

The heavily-armed police entered the home and arrested her.

Officers then raided the property where she lived with alleged bikie Mekhail and the couple's young son.

Inside they found a black Play Station 4 matching the one bought months earlier.

The crime is set to come as a shock to Attie's social media followers, where she regularly posts a series of selfies in expensive lingerie (pictured) or of her lavish lifestyle

In June she showed off a Gucci belt and a fancy black dress as she and her husband smiled at their son Elias' christening

Attie's shopping spree at Footlocker and EB Games totalled $1300, but initially it was alleged she had spent more than $2000.

The dropped charges included $247 spent at women's clothing store Supre.

The guilty plea to obtaining property by deception must come as a shock for Attie's social media followers, to who she regularly showed off a lavish lifestyle. 

In June she showed off a Gucci belt and a fancy black dress as she and her husband smiled at their son's christening.

The tattooed pair were married in early 2019 after the birth of their son, Elias. 

CCTV from inside Westfield Eastgardens captured Attie shopping with two friends, with police describing her as 'blonde' with 'lip fillers'

Attie was initially hit with five charges but will return to the Downing Centre Local Court on October 21 for sentencing on just one count of dishonestly obtain property

'Standing by your side and watching you become the person and daddy you are today has been so special,' she wrote last year.

'I am so so blessed to have you as my partner and can’t wait to be on this crazy ride called life with you. Baby No.2?'

Attie will return to court on October 21 for sentencing.
