Danny Ings reported back to St George Park with a mixture of nerves and excitement that left him feeling as if he was returning to school.

The Southampton striker was set to be named in Gareth Southgate's squad for the March games against Italy and Denmark that were abandoned due to the coronavirus pandemic but he was rewarded for a brilliant campaign with a first England senior call since 2015.

Ings won his only cap against Latvia when Roy Hodgson was manager - he gave his shirt from the game to his father, Shane - but Southgate has long-been an admirer of the 28-year-old, who scored 22 goals last season in the Premier League and blossomed with the responsibility of being their main man.

Danny Ings' fine form at Southampton has been rewarded with a return to the England fold

Southampton want to reward Ings, who has entered the final two years of his contract, with a new deal but before that intention can become reality, he wants to make his mark in the Nations League fixtures against Iceland and Denmark.

'It is not intimidating, competition at any level is a good thing,' said Ings. 

'It is the same at club level too, when there is competition you are pushing each other and getting the best out of each other. For me it is just about being the best I can be and giving myself this opportunity for these squads and that is what I am trying to do.

Gareth Southgate is a long-term admirer of Ings and watched him closely last season

'It is kind of like the first day back at school, one of those feelings where like you go in and you are a bit nervous inside. You haven't been here in a few years. But the moment I stepped into the building its familiar faces..' 

On the prospect of signing a new deal, Ings added: 'I have just read the same as what you probably have. I'm extremely humbled that the club value me - that's great. 

'I don't know what the next step is - I don't know what the club's intentions are - but the fact they value me makes me feel good.'
