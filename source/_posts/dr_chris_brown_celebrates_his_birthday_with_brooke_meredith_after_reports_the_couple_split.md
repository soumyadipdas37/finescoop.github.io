Chris Brown and his girlfriend Brooke Meredith sparked rumours they had split earlier this year.

But on Friday, the pair put an end to the reports when they were spotted celebrating the veterinarian's 42nd birthday together in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The couple appeared stony faced as they soaked up the warmer weather during a stroll.

Chris cut a casual figure in a blue T-shirt and tan chinos which he paired with brown thongs. 

The television presenter carried a grey puffer vest with him and shaded his eyes with a pair of trendy sunglasses. 

Meanwhile, Brooke looked chic in a white collared shirt and a pair of denim jeans that flaunted a hint of her taut midriff.

The model accessorised the look with simple flats, a black crossbody bag and sunglasses. 

She flaunted her stunning looks with natural makeup and wore her brunette locks in a half up 'do.  

The stroll comes after reports Chris had split from Brooke, after less than six months of dating.

In August, Woman's Day claimed that Chris was back on the market after cryptically hinting at his split from the 29-year-old model on Instagram.

'Over the last few months there's been no more dependable partner in the pandemic than a face like this,' he wrote alongside a photo of his cat.

The couple were last spotted together back in May, when they were pictured holding hands during a romantic beach stroll.
