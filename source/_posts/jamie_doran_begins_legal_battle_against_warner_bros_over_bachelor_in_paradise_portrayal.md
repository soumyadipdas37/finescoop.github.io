Bachelor franchise star Jamie Doran has officially lodged legal claims against Warner Bros International.

Jamie first announced his intention to sue in July - citing that his 'in-depth' legal case went beyond his negative portrayal on popular dating series Bachelor In Paradise.

According to The Daily Telegraph, the reality star, 40, has hired a high-powered Sydney lawyer to represent his lawsuit.

While it's been two months since Jamie made his extraordinary lawsuit intention, the star's recent appointment of a lawyer proves he's not bluffing.

Lawyer Keith Radenbach of Radenbach Legal confirmed to Confidential on Monday that Jamie is going ahead with his lawsuit.

'He's lodged claims formally and we're progressing further claims,' Radenbach said, choosing not to elaborate on the nature of Jamie's claims. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Warner Bros., as well as Jamie Doran's management and lawyer Keith Radenbach for comment.

On July 29, Jamie announced he would be taking legal action against Channel 10 and Warner Bros. over his portrayal on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. 

'Don't assume that my legal case against Network 10 and Warner Bros is built around an "edit". It's a lot more in-depth and there's a lot more in play here,' Jamie said on social media in August. 

However, since making these claims, Jamie has only lodged official claims against Warner Bros., and not Channel 10.

Update: In August, Jamie gave further details on his legal case, claiming it would be 'more in-depth' than the media had been speculating

Change of mind: Despite originally threatening Network 10 with legal action, Jamie has only lodged official claims against Warner Bros.

In the firefighter-turned-FIFO worker's initial Instagram statement, he explained why he had decided to call in his lawyers.

He wrote: 'This is not the news I wanted to post, but I feel I owe this to at least my family, friends, and also fans of The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. 

Jamie continued: 'A "bad edit" should be the least of their problems moving forward.'

'I'm not going to comment on this any further for the time being and would appreciate it if people would respect my privacy.'

In response to Jamie's legal threat, a network spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia on July 29: 'Channel 10 has not received any papers regarding this claim.'

Jamie was portrayed as a 'stage-five clinger' on Bachelor in Paradise this season, and received a similar edit on The Bachelorette last year.
