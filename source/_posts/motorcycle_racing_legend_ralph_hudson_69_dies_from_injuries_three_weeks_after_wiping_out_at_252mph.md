A 69-year-old legendary motorcycle rider who once reached a record speed of 300mph during a race died on Sunday three weeks after losing control of his motorcycle and crashing in Utah while he was clocked at 252mph.

Ralph Hudson was severely injured in a crash while racing at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Wendover, Utah, on August 14.

Hudson’s death was announced on Sunday by the Southern California Timing Association.

Immediately after the crash, Hudson was treated by medical responders at the scene and transported to Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City.

Hudson was a 69-year-old legendary motorcycle rider who once reached a record speed of 300mph. On August 14, he lost control of his motorcycle and crashed in Utah while he was clocked at 252mph.

‘It is with a breaking heart I must inform our racing community that Ralph Hudson succumbed last night to the injuries he suffered at Bonneville on August 14,’ SCTA announced on social media.

‘He was surrounded by his son David, myself and his best friend of 30 years, Linda.

‘Information regarding a celebration of life and a memorial scholarship in Ralph’s name will follow when available.

‘We sincerely thank everyone for their kind words, prayers and support during this very difficult time.

‘Ralph would want everyone to stay strong and keep going fast.’

Hudson was airlifted from the crash scene at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Wendover, Utah, to a hospital in Salt Lake City

In 2017, Hudson broke the world land-speed record for fastest partially streamlined, sit-on motorcycle when he clocked in an average speed of 284mph across three runs over a full mile, according to the Glendale News-Press.

Hudson even managed to reach 300mph during his run on the world’s largest salt flat in Bolivia.

From 1971 to 1976, Hudson competed in motorcycle racing at Bonneville, but quit for three decades to support his family.

After his son graduated college in 2006, he returned to racing.
