Former NRL WAG Phoebe Burgess has forged her own career path as an influencer.

And on Saturday, the 31-year-old modelled a flowing floral frock in the stunning surrounds of her parents' Bowral estate, located in the New South Wales' Southern Highlands. 

It comes shortly after the mother-of-two landed a lucrative new deal, as a style ambassador for Specsavers Australia.

In the Instagram images, Phoebe drew attention to her lithe arms and tiny waist in the maxi-dress as she posed for a number of photos, and accessorised with trendy cat eye sunglasses.

For one particular shot, she ran her manicured hands through her wavy blonde tresses, and appeared completely in her element.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, Phoebe modelled the latest in fake reading glasses, as she announced her new role with Specsavers Australia in an Instagram post.

'My non-glasses, glasses are the perfect pairing to simplify any of my louder outfit combos,' the brand ambassador told fans in the post's caption.  

'The crystal clear trend brings a certain sophistication while the keyhole bridge throws it back for a vintage vibe.

'Who would have guessed that acetate plastic could be so chic?!' she continued.
