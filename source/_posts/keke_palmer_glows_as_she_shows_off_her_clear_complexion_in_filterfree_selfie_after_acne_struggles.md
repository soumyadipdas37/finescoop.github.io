'Every time I think my skin is on the up and up I turn around and I'm broken out even worse than before. Scarred up and wondering which products I have to throw out if not ALL.' 

'Feeling completely insecure which in turn makes you irritable and just self conscious for the smallest reasons,' she went on.

But Keke realized opening up would help fans with their own struggles, saying: 'I just thought to share because I know I’m not alone.

But she finished on an optimistic note, telling everyone: 'I'm only human and everyday I'm gonna roll with the punches but some days I will get the air knocked out of me. Gonna keep going though! Cause that's how I was built. Much love.'
