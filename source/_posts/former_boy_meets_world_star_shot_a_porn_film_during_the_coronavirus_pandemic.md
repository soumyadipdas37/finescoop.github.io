Former Boy Meets World star Maitland Ward has revealed how she managed to film a feature-length porn movie during the coronavirus pandemic. 

The 43-year-old adult actress penned an essay for The Daily Beast on Saturday, in which she detailed safety procedures on set of the X-rated flick, titled Muse.  

Production of the highbrow film - which is set during the COVID-19 shutdown and asks the question 'Can pornography be art?' - began in Los Angeles back in July. 

At the time, the city was seeing a dramatic surge in coronavirus cases, making Ward apprehensive about the prospect of getting hot and heavy on camera.

'At first, I have to admit, I was a little skeptical. How would this all work? Would the cast and crew be able to remain safe and healthy for a span of days and weeks?' she writes in her essay. 

'But any trepidation I had quickly left me when I saw the time and effort put in to insure this production would run smoothly and safely.'

Ward goes on to reveal that cast and crew received COVID tests every single morning, regardless of whether or not they were required to be on set. 

The rapid tests were usually returned within 24 hours, giving all employees peace of mind. 

The porn production house also hired an EMT, and temperatures were checked frequently and at random.

Additionally, 'disinfecting, and distancing were enforced, [and] only performers in scenes could take their masks off.' 

The former sitcom star even claimed that there was an unexpected benefit to shooting the sizzling feature in the midst of the pandemic. 

Ward has been abstaining from sexual relations in her person life due to anxiety about spreading and contracting the coronavirus - but the safety of the set gave her a place to let loose without having to worry about anyone being infected. 

'I had missed random human contact so much I think I mauled my first scene partner, but he didn’t seem to mind,' she cheekily writes.  

Ward further states that the procedures put in place on the set of the film could also be applied during production of mainstream Hollywood movies.

'The shoot went so well, the film has now been turned into a series that will span several seasons, while mainstream doesn’t know when any of its shows can film again at all,' she boasts.

The redheaded actress is best known for her role as Rachel McGuire on Boy Meets World. 

She starred in two seasons of the classic ABC/ Disney sitcom from 1998 - 2000. 

Earlier this year, Ward wrote about her transition to the world of adult entertainment in a separate essay for The Daily Beast.

Ward says she is now making far more money as a porn star than she ever did working for the Disney Channel show and is proud of her career move. 

'Many expected my rise in the adult world, including many in the adult world itself, to be a flash in the pan. It was a stunt. I wasn't serious. But that's what makes this story different: my genuine love for adult performance and for colorful cinema,' she wrote. 

'My story is a journey rather than a cautionary tale. And I'm ready to prove the naysayers wrong.'
