Eddie Jordan is sitting on the balcony of his apartment near the Camps Bay suburb of Cape Town. 

It is early January and early evening and the sun is setting and the sky is streaked with brilliant, beautiful shades of red and Eddie has a glass of white wine in his hand and his wife and sons are listening to him and I’m listening to him and he’s holding court like he loves to do.

He is telling stories about his exercise regimen and he’s dropping names. He says he goes on long bike rides up the coast away from Cape Town with Adrian Newey, one of the greatest car designers in F1 history.

He says that the other day, he went jogging on the sea front with Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa. A smile flits across his sons’ faces.

They start to tease him. It turns out Eddie was jogging along the front when he came across Ramaphosa and his security retinue walking to a meeting.

Eddie gabbled at him for a little and then the president moved on. Eddie disputes the alternative version of events but only half-heartedly and with a sheepish smile. Then he begins a story about Bernie Ecclestone and Formula One in the 1990s.

When he was the team owner of Jordan Grand Prix between 1991 and 2005, Jordan, 72, always knew everybody and everything. Things have not changed.

He is a relentless hunter-gatherer of information about the sport and its machinations. He is not at Mugello this weekend for the Tuscan Grand Prix because he does not want to watch the race wearing a mask so he’s on a yacht off Sardinia and he has still got his ear to the ground.

Jordan says that it is very difficult for Mercedes to improve upon what they have achieved

We are talking about Sebastian Vettel’s impending move from Ferrari to Racing Point, which was announced last week and one question leads to another and he says he has news.

He has watched the pieces falling into place during the last couple of months and now he knows, he says, that a deal that would change the face of F1 has been agreed and is just waiting to be signed. He does not know when it will be announced but he is adamant it will happen.

There have been rumours for some time that Mercedes, the reigning constructors’ champions, the home of six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, and a team enjoying one of the most dominant phases ever seen in F1, may pull back or redirect their involvement in the sport while they are still way out in front at the head of the pack. Mercedes have consistently maintained they will continue to be involved for many years.

Their domination of Grand Prix racing — they have won the last six drivers’ and constructors’ titles — has begun to reach the stage where it is attracting negative publicity.

It is a familiar irony of sport that excellence sometimes leads to unpopularity. Mercedes are so good, so powerful, so far ahead of the rest that they are being accused of making the sport boring. There is logic to the idea that now is a good time to move on.

‘The ownership of the team is going to be taken over by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos,’ says Jordan. ‘The Ineos name is already on the side of the car anyway and they have this technological partnership so this is a nice way out for Mercedes.

‘The team will be called Ineos but it will still be run from the factory in Brackley and Mercedes will retain a 30 per cent share in it. It will not be known as Mercedes any more and Toto Wolff, the team principal, will no longer be in charge.

‘It has become difficult for them. How can they keep winning? How can they improve on what they have already done? They can’t. Toto’s reputation as one of the great team leaders in the history of the sport is already secure.

‘What he has achieved at Mercedes puts him in the same league as Ron Dennis at McLaren and Jean Todt at Ferrari, but all good things come to an end.’

The deal is said to be worth in the region of £700 million for a 70 per cent share in the team and would represent the most high-profile investment in Ratcliffe’s portfolio of sports teams. The billionaire industrialist, who is Britain’s richest man, bought cycling’s all-conquering Team Sky last year, is bankrolling Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup sailing team and owns French Ligue 1 side Nice.

Owning an F1 team, though, would bring him and chemicals giant Ineos a whole new level of visibility and publicity.

Ineos were unveiled as sponsors of Mercedes at the start of this season, with their name embossed on the cars in splashes of burgundy.

That deal alone is said to be worth £100m over five years and was described as more like a ‘partnership’ than a mere sponsorship arrangement at the time. Jordan believes that the partnership is about to change into ownership.

The plan at the start of the season was that the ‘partnership’ would allow Ineos to meld the expertise of Mercedes F1 engineers with Team Ineos’s cycling team and Team UK’s America’s Cup project.

A group of 18 Mercedes engineers were sent to Portsmouth to work on the Ineos Team UK AC75 sailing boat to race in the America’s Cup.

Mercedes’ leading aerodynamics expert Graham Miller moved from the Brackley factory to the south coast. The sale of the team would not end Mercedes’ involvement in F1. It would retain a share in the Ineos team and it is possible that they would bolster their relationship with Racing Point, who will be re-badged as Aston Martin from next season.

Mercedes already supply the engines for Racing Point and some observers have seen Vettel’s decision to race for the team next season as another signal of Mercedes’ involvement, strengthening the team’s German influence.

Increased involvement with Aston Martin would also shift the company’s road-car image further towards the high-class end of the market.

When Ratcliffe unveiled the Ineos sponsorship with the team, he spoke of how Mercedes’ image had already changed.

‘If I look at the Mercedes brand 15 years ago,’ he said. ‘It was like a taxi or elderly person’s car.’ A more high-profile association with Aston Martin would complete the transformation.

Wolff has spoken openly about the fact that he has a small stake in Aston Martin, a fact which increased speculation about his future. There are rumours of fissures in his relationship with Daimler chairman Ola Kallenius, rumours that both men have denied. One suggestion is that if Ineos take over the team, Wolff will seek to change his role from team principal to an advisory position.

‘I need to question myself,’ said Wolff earlier this summer when he was discussing his future in the team. ‘I don’t want to become a team principal that goes from great to good without realising that he is maybe not adding as much to the team as he did in the beginning.

‘I still feel that I can add a lot, but of course I’m contemplating about my future.’

Any change in Wolff’s position would also fuel speculation about the future of Hamilton.

He and Wolff have a close working relationship and any change to that could be a trigger for Hamilton leaving the team for which he has won the last three world titles and five in all, to go with the championship he won with McLaren.

Hamilton’s contract with Mercedes runs out at the end of this season and he is yet to sign a new one but he insisted last month that he had no desire to race for another team. An obvious destination would be Ferrari, who are contesting their 1,000th F1 race this weekend.

But the Italian team are in such a state of disarray that anyone who joins them now, even Hamilton, would have to contemplate at least a season of racing in an uncompetitive car.

Jordan says that it would be difficult for Hamilton to join Ferrari given their current situation

‘It is a foregone conclusion that Lewis will win a seventh title this season,’ says Jordan. ‘When he does that, he will have equalled Michael’s [Schumacher] record. A lot of the drivers who drove for me at Jordan went on to drive for Ferrari — including Michael obviously — and most of the racers I have met have a pull towards driving for them at some time in their career.

‘I don’t know any driver who doesn’t relish the idea of joining the Prancing Horse but the problem with Lewis going there next season is that the Ferrari situation is catastrophic at the moment.

‘I have been in F1 a long time and I have never seen the Ferrari situation this bad. The car just does not have the speed. For a team with their resources, it is unacceptable.

‘Equally, if Lewis went to Ferrari and won a championship there, it would complete his legacy. I still don’t think he gets the credit he deserves. I think Lewis has a claim to be the greatest of all time.’

Hamilton leads the drivers’ standings by 47 points. The odds are he will be Mercedes’ seventh champion in a row. Jordan is adamant that it will also be their last of the current era.
