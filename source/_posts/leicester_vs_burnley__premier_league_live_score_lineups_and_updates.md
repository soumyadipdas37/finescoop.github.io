Burnley get their Premier League season underway with a visit to the King Power Stadium to take on Leicester City this evening.  

Brendan Rodgers' side will be hoping to make it two wins from two after their thumping win over West Brom on the opening weekend of the season.

Burnley's original opening fixture was postponed because of Manchester United's involvement in the Europa League's latter stages. 

Sportsmail will provide live EPL coverage of Leicester vs Burnley including score, lineups and build-up.
