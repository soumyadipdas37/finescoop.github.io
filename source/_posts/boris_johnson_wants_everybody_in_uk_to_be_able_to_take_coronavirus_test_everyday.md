Boris Johnson today said he wants everybody in the UK to be able to take a daily coronavirus test in order to get life back to normal after Matt Hancock blasted people for needlessly booking checks. 

The Prime Minister said his 'vision' for the future is for the whole nation to have access to a pregnancy-style test which would reveal within 15 minutes if someone has the virus. 

The PM said the so-called 'enabling tests' could be used at the start of the day so that workers know for certain whether they are infected and need to stay at home. 

His comments came after Mr Hancock blamed an ongoing test and trace fiasco on people without coronavirus symptoms trying to get checked.

The Government is facing mounting criticism after reports of numerous people with symptoms being unable to get a test or being told they have to travel long distances to get one. 

Mr Hancock said people without symptoms unnecessarily booking tests was putting the system under strain. 

He also hinted Covid tests could be rationed unless people who are fit and healthy stop draining capacity, as he said: 'We've got to be firmer, I'm afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing.'

Mr Hancock said it was 'not acceptable' for people to ask for a test if they have no symptoms.

In other coronavirus developments today: 

Rapid pregnancy-style tests for Covid-19 could be approved within weeks, according to a leading scientist.

 Sir John Bell, an Oxford University scientist and key Government adviser, said the cheap devices were currently being assessed by scientists at Public Health England.

He claimed they could be sold on Amazon or Boots for as little as £5 if they are proven to be over 90 per cent accurate. 

Professor Bell said the devices, that are 'no larger than a teacup', plug into a socket in the wall and process swabs within an hour.

One from the US which is currently under review is able to process a sample in the time it would take for a person to have a shower or eat their breakfast, he claimed. 

The UK is currently relying on PCR swab tests which take at least 24 hours to turnaround after being sent to a laboratory. 

Home test kits are already part of the Government's testing scheme but they still need to be sent to the laboratory. Less than seven per cent come back in the 24-hour target time. 

There are at least four rapid tests being trialled in hospitals and care homes. But they are clunky and not designed to be taken at home. 

Sir John, a regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, believes mass screening will become possible with rapid home kit tests.  

Sir Keir Starmer grilled Mr Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions over people's inability to get tests. 

Mr Johnson defended the current performance of NHS Test and Trace and said its workers were 'doing a heroic job'. 

He then set out more detail of the Government's plans to move to a mass testing regime which will see people without symptoms tested.

Mr Johnson said: 'Yes, we will do more and the world we want to move to as fast as possible is a world in which everybody can take enabling tests at the beginning of the day, an antigen test, to identify whether we have the virus or not, like a pregnancy test, within 15 minutes or so, so that we know whether we are able to live our lives as normally as possible.

‘That is the vision that the Health Secretary and others have been sketching out over the last few days.

‘That is where we intend to get to.’

Earlier, the Health Secretary rejected claims that the testing system was failing, telling Sky News that testing capacity was at its highest ever level.

He added: 'We have had stories of schools sending a whole year group to go and get a test and that is not appropriate, what is appropriate is that if you have symptoms then get a test.' 

Questioned over whether the system was failing, he told Sky News: 'I completely reject the accusation, in fact quite the contrary.'

He said the UK has the biggest system per capita in Europe and the highest testing capacity 'we've ever had'.

'However in the last couple of weeks we've seen an increase in demand, including an increase in demand from people who are not eligible for tests, people who don't have symptoms,' he added.

'We've seen an increase of about 25% of people who are coming forward that don't have symptoms and aren't eligible.'

The Health Secretary told the public not to get coronavirus tests unless they have symptoms in order to stop people having to travel long distances to get tested.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'We have seen this quite sharp rise in the last couple of weeks of people without symptoms who don't have a good reason coming forward to get a test.

'There have been stories of whole schools, or parts of schools, being all sent to get a test - that is not acceptable, that is not an appropriate use of our testing resources.

'I've even heard stories of people saying, 'I'm going on holiday next week therefore I'm going to get a test.' No - that is not what the testing system is there for.

'We've got to be firmer, I'm afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing.'

'Of people who got symptoms, 92 per cent got a test within ten miles of (their home),' he told the Today programme.

'The reason we have constraints at the moment is not because capacity has gone down, it's because demand has gone up.

'For instance, I've heard stories of whole schools been told to get a test and all pupils. That is not what testing is there for.'

Defending the government's test and trace service amid growing criticism, the Health Secretary claimed people with no symptoms applying for tests was putting the system under strain

The positivity rate of coronavirus tests in the UK has remained flat since June, showing that the proportion of people testing positive is not changing drastically - this suggests the rising number of cases is linked to the rising number of tests

Testing has increased vastly from no more than 13,000 tests per day at the start of April to around 150,000 in July and 200,000 in August

Mr Hancock also said he'd heard of cases of people requesting coronavirus tests because they were going on holiday and wanted to find out whether they had the virus.

Testing capacity has recently been cranked up across the UK to 'record highs' but it is still meant to only be available for people who have coronavirus symptoms.

MailOnline found that it was possible to order a coronavirus test, even if you didn't have Covid symptoms, by filling in a request form online saying that you'd been asked to take one. 

There was no option to say that you had been asked to get a test by your school, or that you had no symptoms but were concerned. 

The director of testing, Sarah-Jane Marsh, yesterday apologised to those who were not getting tests and warned they were at a 'critical pinch-point'.

'Can I please offer my heartfelt apologies to anyone who cannot get a Covid test at present,' she wrote. 

Mr Hancock also refused to rule out a second national lockdown, telling Sky News: 'Our goal is to avoid having to do anything more drastic - I won't make a vow like that. 

'I'm a Health Secretary in the middle of a pandemic.'  

The coronavirus test ordering system does not give users the option to say they are ordering a test because they are concerned

The British Medical Association today said it was 'ludicrous' that the coronavirus test booking system is directing people to centres dozens or even hundreds of miles away from their homes. 

People report being instructed to drive dozens of miles, some of them more than 100 miles or even from Suffolk to Scotland, to their closest available same-day test.

An investigation by the BBC found that the system routinely tried to direct people to testing centres tens or hundreds of miles from their homes.

London postcodes were directed to Cardiff, it found, while someone in Devon might have to travel more than 100 miles to Wales, and a postcode in the Lake District redirected to a test centre in Scotland.

One hapless man, David Llewellyn, told the broadcaster he was told to go to a centre near Blackburn, near Manchester, more than 200 miles from his home in Suffolk.

And a MailOnline investigation discovered testing centres in Twickenham, Heathrow and Greenwich were practically empty despite callers being told no slots were unavailable. 

A number of people in the capital needing swabs have now come forward to complain they had been told none could be taken in the city.

Dr Peter English, chair of public health at the British Medical Association, said: 'It’s ludicrous that people are being directed so far from their homes for testing. 

'In some cases, it means driving for three hours – and back – which is completely inappropriate at the best of times, let alone for someone who may be ill with Covid-19 symptoms. Travelling such distances are expensive, and that’s if individuals have access to a car at all.'

Health Secretary acknowledged the system was facing 'operational challenges' but said it was 'working well' overall. 

NHS testing boss issues 'heartfelt apology' to people unable to get Covid tests and blames lack of capacity at laboratories for backlog 

By Jemma Carr for MailOnline 

NHS Test and Trace director of testing Sarah-Jane Marsh (pictured) has issued an apology 

A senior official at NHS Test and Trace last night issued an apology to people unable to get a Covid-19 test as officials consider new lockdown restrictions to curb the current spike in cases.

Director of testing Sarah-Jane Marsh said there is capacity at testing sites but laboratories processing the tests are at a 'critical pinch-point'.

Ms Marsh added that the system is doing 'all it can to expand quickly'.

There have been reports of people being told there are no appointments available at test centres in England and that there are no home tests kits available to send out.

Ms Marsh wrote on Twitter: 'Can I please offer my heartfelt apologies to anyone who cannot get a Covid test at present.

'All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded; it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point. We are doing all we can to expand quickly.

'We have additional NHS, Lighthouse, University and Partner Labs all due to open up imminently and we are also expanding the use of non-Laboratory based tests.The testing team work on this 18 hours a day, seven days a week. We recognise the country is depending on us.' 

Andy Thompson, 38, a technical manager from Crewe, said his six-year-old daughter is home from school with a continuous cough, but has so far been unable to get a home test.

'It's an absolute shambles. No home tests available. And now the nearest test centre is Oldham, a 100-mile round-trip with a sick child,' he said.

Ms Marsh said there is capacity at testing sites but laboratories processing the tests are at a 'critical pinch-point'

'I didn't realise how bad it is. If you haven't got a car, no way you're getting tested.'

People have also complained in recent days and weeks of being directed hundreds of miles to get a test.

On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged that people would have to travel no more than 75 miles for a test.

Further problems with the testing system came as a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the latest increase in coronavirus cases is 'very worrying'.

Professor Andrew Hayward said scientists are monitoring the data closely for signs of wider community transmission of the disease.

'Generally it is local outbreaks, but there is also very worrying increases in cases, particularly over the last few days,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'That is what we are really keeping a close eye on - the extent to which it moves away from these local outbreaks to broader community transmission.

'What we saw in the last few days from this surveillance data was this worrying increase in cases which, as we know from the first wave of the pandemic, can potentially get out of hand if we don't be very serious about the control measures.'

The Department of Health last week revealed it is investing £500million in getting rapid on-the-spot coronavirus tests into public use in its battle against Covid-19. 

Trials in Salford, Southampton and Hampshire will blaze the trail for the tests, which could change the way people live with coronavirus.

Mr Hancock suggested that if regular, mass testing can come as a result of these devices, it would be the country's 'best shot' at spelling the end of social distancing rules in the absence of a vaccine. 

Tests made by the companies Oxford Nanopore (LamPORE technology), Optigene and DNANudge are all being trialled by the British Government on members of the public.

Meanwhile, NHS hospitals are using a swab test-processing machine called the SAMBA II and Public Health England is evaluating kits made in the style of pregnancy tests which could become available in the future.   

MailOnline takes a look at some of the tech that could be used in the UK:

LamPORE – saliva sample testing in 90 minutes

The small LamPORE test could be deployed in airports, offices, schools, pubs and restaurants – bringing testing to the bulk of the population 

Sample type: Saliva or nasal swab

Turnaround time: 90 minutes

Tests per day: 2,000 (small); 15,000 (large)

Accuracy: 99% (claimed)

Price: Unknown (UK has bought at least 450,000)

Biotech company Oxford Nanopore has developed portable swab-recording devices that use the firm's LamPORE tests, which can determine whether a user has Covid in the space of an hour-and-a-half.

The larger device is more suitable for hospitals and airports 

The machines take 90 minutes to give a result and can process up to 15,000 samples a day.

It involves taking a sample of saliva, unlike existing methods which require invasive and difficult nose and throat swabs. 

The LamPORE device, which also comes in a desktop version which is about the size of a printer, uses electronic means to record and analyse the samples.

Each test is given a barcode which is individually assessed before returning back with the result. This must be done in a lab but these can be set up remotely, such as in the back of a van or at a pop-up testing site. The portable version of the LamPORE device is the same size as a CD player. 

Ministers have ordered 450,000 of the tests, which are now being trialled in Salford and Southampton. Millions more are due to be rolled out later in the year if they prove to be effective.

The Salford trial will invite people in the community to come for weekly tests using a new saliva Covid-19 test that produces results in under an hour and a half.

The pilot will begin with a select number of participants and up to 250 tests a day, to be scaled to the whole area. 

Initially, the pilot will focus on specific high footfall locations in the city, which includes retail, public services, transport and faith spaces. 

Phase two of the no-swab saliva test pilot in Southampton will also start this week. 

The second phase of the pilot will trial the weekly testing model in educational settings, with participation from staff and students at the University of Southampton and four Southampton schools. 

Over 2,100 pupils and staff across four schools will be invited to have a test as part of the pilot, which is led by a partnership of the University of Southampton, Southampton City Council and the NHS.

The makers of the test have not revealed how accurate it is, and the Government has refused to divulge that information, too.  

Mr Hancock said of the tests: 'Oxford Nanopore’s new rapid LamPORE tests will benefit thousands of people with fast and accurate test results, removing uncertainty and breaking chains of transmission quickly and safely.

'I am hugely grateful for the fantastic work Oxford Nanopore have done to push forward this important innovation in coronavirus testing.'

OptiGene – swab results in 20 minutes

Sussex-based biomedical company OptiGene has created a nasal and throat swab test that takes just 20 minutes to diagnose people 

Sample type: Nasal & throat swab, or saliva

Turnaround time: 20 minutes

Tests per day: 300 per hour

Accuracy: 97%

Price: Unknown

Sussex-based biomedical company OptiGene has created a nasal and throat swab test that takes just 20 minutes to diagnose people.

Once swabs have been collected from patients, the samples are loaded into the devices, known as the Genie HT, which look for tiny traces of the virus in their DNA.  

The machines amplify the DNA billions of times chemically so they can detect the virus with extreme sensitivity. They can also be used with saliva samples.

The device has proven to be just as accurate as PCR swabs, which take days to give results, in clinical trials by Public Health England. 

In contrast to the widely used PCR tests, which need be processed at different temperatures, the Genie HT does not require a change in temperature to detect results. 

It is currently being trialled by the Government on thousands in A&E departments, GP coronavirus testing hubs and care homes across Hampshire, and will be rolled out in the new testing programmes in Salford and Southampton.

Four thousand people of all ages have been involved in the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Trust trial.

A study done during that trial Hampshire have found the test to be 97 per cent sensitive, meaning it can find 97 out of 100 positive cases, and 99 per cent specific, meaning only one in 100 people would get a false positive result.  

DNANudge – 75 minutes to a result from a nostril swab

 One of the new test kits, made by London-based DNANudge, scours DNA in nose swabs and takes just 75 minute

Sample type: Nostril 

Turnaround time: 75 minutes

Tests per day: 15 

Accuracy: 98%

Price: £28 each on average (UK paid £161million for 5.8m tests including 5,000 machines)

The DNANudge test can detect the virus from just a nostril sample - much less invasive than some throat swabs.

Once a swab is taken, it's inserted into a handheld reader that provides results within just 75 minutes. 

The DnaNudge has a sensitivity of over 98 per cent - meaning it can pick up on mild and asymptomatic cases - and specificity of 100 per cent.

The 100 per cent specificity means it can tell the difference between a person who doesn't have the disease at all and a sample which wasn't taken properly, meaning there aren't any false negatives.

After successful trials on 500 patients in London hospitals, the 'lab in a cartridge' device was approved for clinical use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) at the end of April.

The Government has purchased at least 5,000 of the DNANudge machines, which can process up to 15 tests a day, to provide six million tests in the coming months.

The test, developed by Imperial College London's Chris Toumazou, is based on the design of a DNA test and can give a result in just over an hour, significantly cutting down on the 48-hour wait for a laboratory diagnosis. 

Matt Hancock has previously said about the machines: 'By quickly detecting whether the virus is present in an individual, this new test is an important step forward in point of care testing which means that positive cases can be identified and contained quickly and safely. 

'I am hugely grateful to DnaNudge and their incredible work to innovate coronavirus testing, which will mean we can test millions more people in the coming months.'          

SAMBA II – £30-a-go swab analyser is 99% accurate

The SAMBA II was created by  University of Cambridge spin-off company Diagnostics for the Real World

Sample type: Nose and throat swab 

Turnaround time: 90 minutes

Tests per day: 15

Accuracy: 99%

Price: £30 per test

 The SAMBA II has shown to be almost 99 per cent accurate at analysing swabs and can give a result in just 90 minutes.

The portable machine can diagnose Covid-19 in less than 90 minutes, but only has the capacity to process 15 tests a day.

It was developed by University of Cambridge spin-off company Diagnostics for the Real World.

It scours DNA in throat and nose swabs to detect the virus.

Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge has been trialling the device since April.

They have shown to be so effective that the hospital switched nearly all of its coronavirus testing from standard lab tests to the Samba machines in May.

A Samba test, costing approximately £30 per sample, would outweigh the cost of each additional bed day at around £200 'many times over', the team said.

The tests have been validated at the Public Health England, Cambridge in 102 patient samples and shown to have 98.7 per cent sensitivity and 100 per cent specificity.

The machines are already used to diagnose other blood-borne diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.

Randox – portable swab tester saves on lab time

Randox's portable antigen test, called the Vivalytic, can process five swabs an hour

Sample type: Nose and throat swab 

Turnaround time: 12 minutes 

Tests per day: Five per hour

Accuracy: Unknown 

Price: Unknown

 The Government partnered with Northern Irish firm Randox in April to ramp up testing in the nation. 

Randox's portable antigen test, called the Vivalytic, can process five swabs an hour. These are likely to be the same type of swabs currently used – that go in the nose and mouth – but processed at speed.

It has been scaled up across multiple hospitals in Northern Ireland.

The device is also used at the point of care and operated by a healthcare professional.

Randox says its device works by 'identifying SARS-CoV-2 and differentiating it from nine other respiratory infections with similar symptoms, including influenza and all known coronaviruses'. 

The devices are still being trialled.

In July, 750,000 swabs were recalled after they failed to meet the required safety standards. Randox said the issue was with one of its suppliers of its swabs.

The machines which process the swabs have not been deemed unsafe. 

Pregnancy test-style kits – home tests for £5 being checked by PHE 

Sir John Bell, an Oxford University scientist and key Government adviser, said cheap pregnancy-style tests devices were currently being assessed by scientists at Public Health England

Rapid tests for Covid-19 which give a diagnosis in minutes could be approved within weeks, according to a leading scientist.

Sir John Bell, an Oxford University scientist and key Government adviser, said the cheap devices were currently being assessed by scientists at Public Health England.

He did not reveal which tests have been selected for inspection by officials, but mentioned a 'lovely test from the US' being brought in. 

He claimed they could be sold on Amazon or Boots for as little as £5 if they are proven to be over 90 per cent accurate. 

Professor Bell said the devices, that are 'no larger than a teacup', plug into a socket in the wall and process swabs within an hour.

One from the US which is currently under review is able to process a sample in the time it would take for a person to have a shower or eat their breakfast, he claimed.  

Sir John said scientists at Porton Down - government run laboratories in Salisbury, Wiltshire, are currently assessing rapid antigen tests.

Intelligent Fingerprinting – experimental kit that uses sweat

The rapid test  scours sweat for the virus and takes just 10 minutes

This sweat-testing kit is not a confirmed part of the UK Government's considerations but has potential as a simple alternative to swab testing. 

British diagnostics firm Intelligent Fingerprinting and Imperial College London joined forces to develop a rapid test that scours sweat for the virus.

The test is said to take just 10 minutes to produce a diagnosis. It works by collecting fingerprint sweat onto a small test cartridge for analysis. The sample is then analysed by a portable DSR-Plus analysis unit.

The machine uses sensitive lateral flow technology and fluorescence measurement methods.

Its makes say the test is more hygienic and has less chance of being done wrong because it utilises sweat samples rather than a throat or mouth swab. 

It's unclear how accurate the test is or whether UK ministers are looking into it.
