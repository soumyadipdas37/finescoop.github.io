The 35-year-old teased her taut midriff in the crop top, while showing some hip in the jeans, which were open on the sides and laced up with thin chains.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of gold hoop earrings, matching bangles and blue and purple Nikes with yellow laces, matching her top.

Draya also matched the top with a yellow Chanel handbag, which she showed off in the Instagram shot, writing: 'I be on my grind daily.'  

She previously took to her Instagram Story with a selfie in the look, as she sat on her porch, writing: 'Sitting outside of my crib in yesterday's clothes, stalking packages, and supervising these delivery men.'
