It's been a sorry fall for Dele Alli over the last few years but no one could have ever envisioned it coming to this: Tottenham resigning him to a lost cause. 

Alli was once thought of so highly it was almost as if he was the best thing to come along since sliced bread. That feels like a long time ago now.

As a 21-year-old midfielder scoring 18 goals in a Premier League season, the trajectory of his career was only heading in one direction. Under the guidance of Mauricio Pochettino, it genuinely felt like he was developing into the world's next big thing.

Dele Alli's Tottenham career is in doubt with Jose Mourinho losing patience with him

The midfielder was hauled off after just 45 minutes in their opening day defeat against Everton

Mourinho felt like the man to get Alli firing again but has failed to motivate the England star

It has gone very off script then to think that only three years later that Tottenham would be ready to cut ties and Alli would be so far off the England squad he doesn't even enter the conversation. 



But somewhere along the way the spark has gone out. The twinkle in his eye has long disappeared and given way to dejection and frustration and it has left everyone scratching their heads wondering what has happened to the player that was once our most exciting product.

Alli had gone stale in the last year of Pochettino's tenure but when Jose Mourinho was announced as his successor last November there was a sense that he could be the man to reinvigorate the midfielder and get the best out of him.

That theory appeared to be vindicated when the consistency which had been eluding him for the past 18 months made a brief return in Mourinho's first handful of matches. 

He registered an assist in Mourinho's first game in charge, a victory against West Ham, and followed that up with a brace against Bournemouth and a goal at Old Trafford.

The next game he got two assists and scored a few weeks later at home to Brighton. It felt like the beginning of something wonderful but as results began to slip so did his form. 

In the 2016-17 season, Alli scored 18 times in the league and looked like the real deal

 Mourinho has invested time in Alli but now seems to have given up with star now set to be sold

From the 'All or Nothing' documentary, it was clear to see that Mourinho has invested time and energy in Alli. He would have known very well the value an in-form Alli could have added to his team. 

And so he held pep talks with the midfielder, urged him to consider his 'party boy' lifestyle and warned him of the regrets he would have if he failed to achieve the things his talent warranted.

Mourinho knew Alli was capable of more and pushed him to show it after branding him 'f***ing lazy'.

He wanted to find out what made him tick and how he could get him back on the right path. Mourinho used to be a master in problem solving but he is not the manager he once was either and this particular puzzle has proven too difficult.

The 24-year-old hasn't showed any signs of the old Alli in recent months and cut a despondent figure having been hauled off after 45 minutes in their opening day defeat against Everton. It's been claimed that Alli and Mourinho fell out at half-time and that their relationship has now completely broken down.

If Alli's future wasn't uncertain before it certainly appears to be now after Mourinho decided to leave him out of his squad to face Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the Europa League.

It is obvious that Daniel Levy is prepared to put his utmost trust in Mourinho - he doesn't just rip up Spurs' transfer policy and shatter their wage structure to sign Gareth Bale, a 31-year-old forward for just anybody - and if he wants Alli out, Alli will be moved on.  

Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan have emerged as likely landing spots and neither seem like a bad option, though one feels like a better suit.

Inter have Antonio Conte, a passionate and inspirational coach who will not  mince his words: If anyone is going to give Alli the royal kick up the backside he needs to get firing again, he would be a good bet. 

Conte demands the best from his players and is no stranger to getting careers back on track - just look at what he has done with Romelu Lukaku.

When he found him, Lukaku was stuck in a rut - a similar situation to what Alli has found himself in - but after just one season with Conte he has rediscovered his scoring touch and is once again one of the best marksmen in Europe. 

Antonio Conte has a proven record of getting the best out of his players and wants Alli at Inter

Alli's former team-mate Christian Eriksen is at Inter but has struggled for form since joining 

The duo had a great relationship at Spurs and could help each other if they reunited at Inter

Conte has always admired Alli from afar and tried to sign him when he was at Chelsea.

Since taking over the reigns at Inter last summer, Conte has developed a preference for Premier League players and brought Alli's team-mate Christian Eriksen to the San Siro earlier this year.

Eriksen shared a fruitful partnership with Alli and they - along with Harry Kane - functioned as Tottenham's driving force for many years. 

Eriksen has not yet delivered the kind of performances that made him one of the Premier League's best ever imports in an Inter shirt but there is hope that reuniting the pair could act as a catalyst for them both.

There is no escaping that Alli's career is in need of resuscitation and a change of scenery might be just what the doctor ordered.
