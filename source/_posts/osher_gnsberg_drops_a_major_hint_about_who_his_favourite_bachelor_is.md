Osher Günsberg has hosted eight seasons of The Bachelor since 2013, but has never revealed his favourite suitor.

But he hinted on the Cocktails and Roses podcast on Thursday that one leading man left him particularly impressed: 2015's Sam Wood.

The TV presenter, 46, said that he really respected gym owner Sam, 40, for how he didn't string along women he wasn't interested in.

Does Osh have a favourite suitor? Osher Günsberg, who has hosted eight seasons of The Bachelor since 2013, hinted on Thursday that one leading man left him particularly impressed

He was discussing Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor with ex-contestant Alisha Aitken-Radburn when he praised Sam's conduct on the show.

Alisha noted how disappointing it must have been for Steph Harper to go on a single date with Locky Gilbert and not return to the mansion with a rose.

When this happens late in the season, this usually means the woman in question is going to be sent home at the next rose ceremony - which could be days away.

Good bloke: Osher said that he really respected 2015 suitor Sam Wood (left, with his winning contestant Snezana Markoski) for how he didn't string along women he wasn't interested in

Osher pointed at that during his season Sam would send women home straight away if he didn't feel a connection, rather than dragging them to a rose ceremony and potentially giving them false hope.

He said: 'If you're a prospective Bachelor and you're listening to this show as research - if you're in like the pre-[show] bubble lockdown figuring out what the hell you're going to do as the Bachelor - Sam Wood it, mate.

'If you're not feeling on the single, in my opinion be a big man, Sam Wood it and say goodnight right there and then.

Right decision: Osher pointed at that during his season Sam would send women home straight away if he didn't feel a connection, rather than dragging them to a rose ceremony and potentially giving them false hope. Sam is pictured with Snezana, whom he married in 2018

'Don't make them wait another couple of days for a rose ceremony.'

Sam went on to choose single mother Snezana Markoski during the 2015 season finale, and they got engaged later that year. They married in Byron Bay in 2018.

The reality TV lovebirds have since welcomed two children, Willow and Charlie. He is also a stepfather to 15-year-old Eve, Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship.

Osher has hosted every season of The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since Channel 10 bought the licence to the U.S. dating franchise in 2013.

He even found love on the show himself when he met freelance makeup artist Audrey Griffen on set of Blake Garvey's season in 2014.

The couple married in 2016 and welcomed a son named Wolfgang in August 2019.

Osher is also a stepfather to Georgia, Audrey's teenage daughter from a previous relationship.
