She has been working on her incredible physique during lockdown.

And Jenny Powell looked sensational as she took her pet pooch for a walk in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on Monday afternoon.

The TV presenter, 52, put on a casual chic display in a loose-fitting purple top that had an embroidered design and frilly sleeves.

Wow! Jenny Powell, 52, put on a VERY leggy display in a frilly purple top and denim shorts as she took her dog for a walk in Cheshire on Monday

Jenny completed her look with a pair of denim shorts and white trainers that helped accentuate her slender legs as she strolled with her pet pooch.

Her raven tresses were brushed into loose waves that fell over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

The former Wheel Of Fortune star added a glittering touch to her look with a silver bangle bracelet and a black hair-tie.

Jenny is engaged to a man, publicly known only as Martin; she divorced ex-husband Toby Baxendale in 2009 after a three-year marriage. They share daughters Constance, 19, and Pollyanna, 11.

Last year, Jenny spoke with Kate Thornton, during an appearance on the White Wine Question Time podcast, about meeting Martin by chance in 2016.

She recalled: 'I was in Pret a Manger at Euston waiting to get the train back up to Manchester and this Adonis walks in, I thought, "Bloody hell, he’s alright".

'And I just put my head down because I was ogling him, and this shadow loomed over me and it was him asking if he could sit down.' 

She added: 'He was chatting away and he said, "Do you want my number?" And I said "What for?" I mean, what girl says that to a fit bloke?

'He went, "Well, you obviously haven’t been dating very much because now, in this day and age, I don’t put any pressure on you; I’ll give you the option. I will give you the number, then you can walk away and then you can think about it." 

'So I grabbed the number off him. I texted him saying: "I'm a mature woman, I don’t play games. My name’s Jenny. This is me. This is my number. Whatever." He rang that night, and asked if he could take me out to dinner.'

After rising to fame on '80s TV show No Limits, Jenny appeared on Wheel Of Fortune alongside both Nicky Campbell and John Leslie from 1995 until 2001.
