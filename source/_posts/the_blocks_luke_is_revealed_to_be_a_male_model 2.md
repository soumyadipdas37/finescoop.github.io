Tuesday's episode of The Block revealed a bombshell - Luke has a side job as a male model.

The 35-year-old carpenter received a gentle ribbing from foremen Keith Schleiger and Dan Reilly.

'Bit different to the catwalk, isn't it?' teased Keith, prompting a smirking Luke to ask, 'What catwalk?' before walking away.

'I just heard a little whisper, mate. He's actually a male model,' a disbelieving Keith told Dan.

'Is he? That might explain a few things in there,' quipped Dan after being left unimpressed with Luke's handiwork in the bathroom.

Clearly amused by his new discovery, Keith began to sing the 1992 hit song to Luke as he walked around the construction site.

'On the catwalk, on the catwalk, yeah, I shake my little tush on the catwalk,' he teasingly sung.

Noticing Luke's smooth legs, a curious Dan and Keith then asked him if he 'shaved'.

As Keith speculated about whether or not he gets waxed, a cheeky Luke turned around and smiled, before shaking his bottom for the camera.

'Well, at least he's good at something,' concluded Keith.
