Scott Morrison has celebrated Father's Day by putting the finishing touches on a cubby house he helped build with his youngest daughter.  

The yellow-coloured play house has been nicknamed 'Kidabilly House' and takes pride of place in the backyard of the family's Kirribilli home, in Sydney.  

The house began as a 'passion school project' for his 11-year-old daughter Lily, though became an opportunity for Mr Morrison to bond with his family.

'The greatest blessing as a dad is spending time with my girls, just being in each other's company is wonderful,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'It's hard to find that time, especially given the demands of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and recession.

'So when my youngest daughter Lily wanted to build a cubby house for her school passion project, this was a great opportunity.' 

Mr Morrison was spotted making several trips to Bunnings over recent weeks to pick up supplies.

His office released a compilation video that showcased the build from start to finish.

'I am here with Lily and we are here to build a cubby house today,' Mr Morrison says.

'We've been to Bunnings. We've got all the wood. We've measured it all out and we're all ready to go. This is quite a family project.' 

Though, Mr Morrison didn't just bang nails into the wood with a hammer.  

He also accidentally hammered his left index finger, leaving him with a badly bruised and swollen nail.

Mr Morrison will spend Father's Day with his wife Jenny and two girls, which includes his eldest daughter Abbey.

This is the first Father's Day Mr Morrison will celebrate without his own father John, who passed away in January.

Mr Morrison took to Instagram to make a heartbreaking tribute to his father following the news.  

'He was a loving husband to my mum Marion for 57 years. 

'He was a wonderful father to me and my brother Alan. He loved Jen as a daughter and was a devoted grandfather to our girls.

'Love you Dad and well done good and faithful servant.'
