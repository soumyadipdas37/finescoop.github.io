She simply dotes on her Maltipoo Elvis.

So it was no surprise that Lucy Hale decided against leaving the pup at home by himself and brought him along on a trip to a Los Angeles mall on Sunday.

The Pretty Little Liars alum, 31, was spotted arriving at the Westfield Fashion Square holding Elvis in one arm as she carried a purse in her other hand.

The actress looked on trend in a tie dye t-shirt that she wore tucked into the top of a pair of blue jeans.

She wore her dark hair tied back from her face and donned sunglasses and a black face mask.

She accessorized with a couple of necklaces and some earrings.

This past Monday, Hale had gushed over her pup in an Instagram post.

Posing with the dog in her lap, she shared a selfie video to her Instagram Story with the legend: 'The nose kills me.'

In the images, she gazes directly into the camera as she rests her head in one hand and smiles sweetly while holding the white fluffy dog in her lap. 

In a separate snap, the pooch is seen posing with a large bone name plate as he sits on an arm chair.

Hale is so devoted to Elvis - or Elvy as she likes to call him - that she got his name inked in cursive on her arm earlier this summer.

Back in May, the actress told Elle that she believes she and Elvis, whom she adopted in 2016, knew each other in a previous life. 

'I totally believe in reincarnation and I know for a fact that I have known Elvis in a life before because we are just entirely too connected,' she said in the 'Ask Me Anything' video for Elle.
