She welcomed daughter Janie with spouse Joshua Jackson just four months ago.

So Jodie Turner-Smith was the perfect model to pose in Kim Kardashian's shapewear line SKIMS on Thursday. 

The 33-year-old Queen & Slim actress looked radiant in a white tank bodysuit for the photoshoot, which she shared to her Instagram.

An accompanying video showed the model and actress unpacking a vintage suitcase while rocking the shapewear.

Turner-Smith captioned the post, 'happy birthday @skims! really excited to be a part of the 1 Year Anniversary campaign because my body has changed so much in the last year and at every size i’ve felt sexy in @skims'.

The English beauty concluded her post, 'thank you for supporting me from press tour to postpartum'.

Last month Turner-Smith posted to Insta Stories about the experience of looking after the infant daughter she shares with the Dawson's Creek alum.

She posted a brief selfie video captioned: 'what is it about the sound of your baby crying that drains you of energy??'

The Nightflyers actress added: 'feel like i ran a marathon today - that delirious feeling of pride in your accomplishment and also like where is the nearest hole to crawl inside and sleep till next year?'

Jodie gave birth to her baby girl this April and a representative for the couple told People: 'Both mother and baby are happy and healthy.'

A couple of days after her rep's statement Jodie publicly announced the big news herself, gushing on Twitter that 'i'm a mother!'

Earlier this week Joshua affectionately posted a social media snapshot of his wife breastfeeding their firstborn child.

The dynamic duo became a couple in 2018 and were glimpsed wearing rings last November before confirming in December that they were married.
