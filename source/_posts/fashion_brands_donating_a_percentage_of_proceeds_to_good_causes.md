Empire state of mind: St. Marks Couture is a New York-based streetwear and clothing brand founded by Yasir Dhannoon and Daniel Salmon

Empower: All profits from the Don't Walk/Vogue tee are be donated to Black led organizations 

St. Marks Couture is a New York-based streetwear and clothing brand founded by Yasir Dhannoon and Daniel Salmon.

The collection was born out of the love two New York transplants have for the Big Apple. 

'We were inspired by St. Mark's place for its uniqueness, diversity and unique history being the origin of art movements, nightlife and what represents NYC,' said Yasir.    

The brand offers all the athleisure essentials, including hoodies, hats and sweatshirts, with their most recent design being the "Don't Walk/Vogue" t-shirt.

'The Don't walk/Vogue was inspired by our love for NYC nightlife, and because the vogue movement is a queer/trans staple in the community,' said Yasir.

Given the state of the world, 'we decided to donate all profits to Black led organizations each month, especially those supporting trans black population in NYC.' 

They poll organizations on Instagram to choose which one to support. So far they've donated to: GLITS, Martha P Johnson and NYC Anti Violence Project. 

'We believe that it is our duty to support and pay back to that community in any way we can.'
