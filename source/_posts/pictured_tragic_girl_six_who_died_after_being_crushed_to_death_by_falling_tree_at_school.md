The 'beautiful little girl' aged six who was tragically killed after being hit by a falling tree at school was today pictured for the first time.

Ella Henderson was rushed to hospital from Gosforth Park First School in Newcastle-upon-Tyne shortly after 1pm on Friday.

An air ambulance took her to the Royal Victoria Infirmary where medics battled to save her life - but she died the following morning.

Grieving friends and family rushed to share their tributes on a fundraising page set up by Ella's mother Vikki Henderson for her 40th birthday - just days after the 'loving sister' was killed.

More than 2,700 people have donated to the cause where more than £40,000 has been raised for the air ambulance charity which tried to save Ella's life. 

In a post on her Facebook page, Mrs Henderson wrote: 'This is not a post I thought I would ever be writing my birthday this year, I'm asking for donations to Great North Air Ambulance Service.

'I've chosen this charity because their mission means a lot to me, and I hope that you'll consider contributing as a way of celebrating with me. Every little bit will help me reach my goal.'

One message - signed off as 'Grandma and Pops' - said the youngster gave them 'such joy in your short life'.

It read: 'You had so many life experiences and were so lucky to have such devoted parents and such a loving sister. We will never forget you. Sending all our love and kisses.'

Another post written by Jennifer Lyn said Ella had a 'lovely kind nature and sweet smile'. 

Tributes describe Ella as a beautiful little girl as her mother Vikki raises thousands for charity

Outside the school, dozens of floral tributes were left for the youngster as thoughtful members of the community shared their condolences over the weekend.  

Children's paintings of rainbows and teddy bears now sit alongside bunches of sunflowers and colourful roses.

One tribute read: 'Bright and beautiful flowers for a beautiful little girl'.

Great North Air Ambulance Service said it was 'overwhelmed by the response to Vikki's fundraiser'.

A source told the Daily Express: 'Vikki's actions in setting up the page, and everyone's generosity in supporting it, will mean other people can benefit from the care of our team. Our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragedy.'

Gosforth Park First School's headteacher said there will be extra support for staff and pupils in the wake of the tragedy.

Leanne Lamb said: 'Our entire school community has been shocked and devastated by the tragic news that one of our pupils passed away during the night, as a result of injuries suffered from a falling tree in the school grounds.

'First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the child's family and friends as they come to terms with this tragic loss.

'As a school and community, we will take the time to mourn and are putting in place extra support for the staff and pupils who are devastated by this incident.

'We would ask that people respect the privacy of the grieving family and the school as we work to understand exactly how this happened.'

 

A spokesman for Northumbria Police confirmed that an investigation was underway, saying: 'Our officers are continuing to support her family and our thoughts are with them at this incredibly difficult time.

'An investigation has been launched with police working in conjunction with the health and safety executive.'
