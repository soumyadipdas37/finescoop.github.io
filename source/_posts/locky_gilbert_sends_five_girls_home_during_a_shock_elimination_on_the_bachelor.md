Locky Gilbert felt the wrath of Areeba Emmanuel during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, after sending the feisty reality star packing.

After being eliminated along with four other contestants, Areeba, 25, fumed that this year's Bachelor clearly had a penchant for 'basic girls'.

'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.

More to come.
