A US production company announced a new reality television show competition where one winner receives a prize that is out of this world – a trip to space.

Called 'Space Hero,' the show's champion will launch aboard a rocket to the International Space Station (ISS) for a 10-day stay with the crew, as reported by Deadline.

The number of contestants has yet to be revealed, but those up for the challenge will undergo rigorous training and grueling tests that push them mentally, physically and emotionally.

The series is set to be shown live around the world, allowing viewers to vote for their favorite contestant to send into orbit.

The production company, also called Space Hero, has secured a seat on the 2023 mission to the ISS for the person who has the right stuff.

Space Hero is being produced by Propagate, which is run by Ben Silverman and Howard T. Owens, who were involved with 'The Office' and 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,' CNBC reports.

Aerospace firm Axiom has also joined the venture, which will train the contestants and overseeing the mission, along with securing a seat on a rocket for the winner.

'The series will search the entire globe for an everyday citizen with a deep love for space exploration,' the company shared in a new release.

'Space Hero will provide an opportunity for anyone from any background to become the first globally-elected space explorer to take part in a mission to the International Space Station.'

The number of contestants has yet to be revealed, but those up for the challenge will undergo rigorous training and grueling tests that push them mentally, physically and emotionally. However, the Space Hero website only shows a countdown clock and no other information about the show

Deadline initially reported that the winner will take a seat on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule for the voyage to the ISS, but Axiom told CNBC that the launcher has yet to be determined.

However, the aerospace company is currently working on other projects with SpaceX, including a 2021 Crew Dragon mission that will send three paying customers and one Axiom commander to the ISS.

Axiom told The Verge that SpaceX is not out of the running for the show, but could go against Boeing's CST-100 Starliner.

The production company has yet to reveal details about cost, but SpaceX sell its seats for about $50 million whereas Boeing offers its for roughly $90 million.

DailyMail.com has contacted Axiom and Space Hero for more details and has yet to receive a response.

Space Hero is not the first production with its eyes on space, as NASA confirmed in May it is set to film a movie aboard the ISS starting Tom Cruise, who will blast off on a SpaceX rocket.

If it gets the go-ahead, the production would be the first action adventure feature film to be filmed in outer space.

NASA's Jim Bridenstine shared on Twitter in May: 'We're excited to work with Tom Cruise on a film aboard the International Space Station.'

'We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make NASA's ambitious plans a reality.'

There is still much be discussed before liftoff is finally approved with no studio currently said to be involved in the title, according to Deadline.

Estée Lauder also announced it is sending bottles of its new skincare serum to the massive orbiting laboratory later this month and astronauts on-board will shoot footage of the product in microgravity.

Estée Lauder president Stéphane de la Faverie all but confirmed the plan last month during an online panel at the the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics's virtual Ascend Summit.

'I'm a risk taker, and that tends to basically come with ideas that are a little bit, you know, outside of the normal, traditional ways of doing marketing,' Faverie said. 

'We're constantly pushing the boundaries of how to showcase our products.' 

The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (£80 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.

It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. 

Research conducted aboard the ISS often requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen.

ISS studies have investigated human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology.

The US space agency, Nasa, spends about $3 billion (£2.4 billion) a year on the space station program, a level of funding that is endorsed by the Trump administration and Congress.

A U.S. House of Representatives committee that oversees Nasa has begun looking at whether to extend the program beyond 2024.

Alternatively the money could be used to speed up planned human space initiatives to the moon and Mars.
