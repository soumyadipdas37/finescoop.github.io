title: Anthony Bailey 
description: Further to a column by freelance commentator Mark Seddon on 28 August 2010 we wish to clarify that an accusation of blackmail against Anthony Bailey OBE was thrown out by a magistrate’s court in 1995, which concluded that his accuser was himself ‘a fraud and an imposter’. Mr Bailey was awarded full costs. We regret this was omitted from our report and are happy to make clear that, after refusing a donation from him in 2005, the Labour Party subsequently agreed their reason for the rejection had been mistaken and  accepted further donations from him. We apologise that these omissions caused distress.
