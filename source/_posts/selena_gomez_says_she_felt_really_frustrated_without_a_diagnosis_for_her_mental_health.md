Selena Gomez felt 'really frustrated' without a diagnosis for her mental health.

The Heart Wants What It Wants hitmaker previously revealed she had bipolar disorder, but admits before she got a diagnosis, she felt 'really alone' because she didn't know anyone else felt the way she did.

'It is something that is very close to me. I've been honest about things in mental health and about my story, so I knew that it was going to be something that I should include,' the Rare singer told Bustle this week. 'I know that there is still such a stigma, but there's still so many people who don't even know their diagnosis.'

Healthy girl: Selena Gomez felt 'really frustrated' without a diagnosis for her mental health. The Heart Wants What It Wants hitmaker previously revealed she had bipolar disorder, but admits before she got a diagnosis, she felt 'really alone' because she didn't know anyone else felt the way she did

The ex of Justin Bieber added, 'And it is really frustrating because when people don't know, it feels like you're really alone, and you feel crazy. Because like, why doesn't anyone else feel like I feel?'

Selena has also offered her advice to her fans who are worried about their mental health and how it has been affected during the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, as she praised her family and 'chosen family' for helping her through it and keeping her 'sane'.

She added: 'I just really ... it breaks my heart, because I actually don't know what to say. 

Her heart: 'It is something that is very close to me. I've been honest about things in mental health and about my story, so I knew that it was going to be something that I should include,' the Rare singer told Bustle this week. 'I know that there is still such a stigma, but there's still so many people who don't even know their diagnosis.' The star was in her Ice Cream video 

'I would just say that I would not have been able to walk through any of this without my family, even my chosen family. I think having a connection to people is what keeps me sane. 

'And I also feel like taking walks around, being in nature - all of that sounds cliche, but it's actually very true.'

Earlier this week the siren talked to Cosmopolitan magazine about her changing weight and how she feels 'insecure' these days.  

Haute stuff: Selena Gomez showed off her slender figure for her new Ice Cream music video that debuted last week

Slim: And on Tuesday more images from the shoot where the 28-year-old was in a black Puma bodysuit were posted on Tik Tok, revealing the former Disney star is slimmer than ever 

A year ago the Rare songbird said that she was body shamed online for putting on a few pounds. The cause of the weight gain was medications she took to help her combat Lupus.

The former child star was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune condition causing inflammation to the joints, skin and other organs, according to the National Health Society (NHS). 

Her condition got so dire, Selena had to have kidney transplant surgery after facing kidney failure.

The star talked about her body as she plugged her new beauty brand Rare to Cosmo. 

Shamed for this: This comes a year after the Rare songbird, seen on the far right with her friends, said that she was body shamed online for putting on a few pounds. The cause of the weight gain was medications she took to help her combat Lupus

She said she worked on the line after feeling 'insecure' with her looks. 

'I've gotten insecure. I also have lupus so I fluctuate in my weight a lot, so I've had to learn pretty early to have thick skin when it comes to this stuff and to understand that it doesn't matter at all. It's just hateful. It's all it is,' she admitted to the publication this week.

'So I wanted to find a way to make this brand into a community - into a lifestyle that's beyond make-up and showing you how to apply it.'

The Texas native added: 'It's about talking about makeup and the relationship you have [with it]. 

'I don't want this to be about me. I know obviously it's created by me, but I would be more proud to see the mission we have behind it as well as enjoy it.'

In November 2019 the star told vodcast Giving Back Generation she had to go on medication to treat her Lupus. That made her add some weight.

'I have lupus and deal with kidney issues and high blood pressure, so I deal with a lot of health issues, and for me, that's when I really started noticing more of the body image stuff,' she stated.

The cover girl felt attacked on social media for her new shape. No one knew at the time she was treating her Lupus. 'It's the medication I have to take for the rest of my life—it depends on even the month, to be honest,' she said.

Another Ice Cream look: She added, 'I don't want this to be about me. I know obviously it's created by me, but I would be more proud to see the mission we have behind it as well as enjoy it'

'So for me, I really noticed when people started attacking me for that. And in reality, that's just my truth. I fluctuate. It depends on what's happening in my life.'

The cruel comments caused her to hide. 'That got me big time,' she said. 'That really messed me up for a bit.'

In 2019 she found a way to deal with the pressure. 'I'm very happy with living my life and being present,' she said. 

Up close: The singer also told Cosmo that after growing up in the spotlight, she soon became aware of her looks by comparing herself to others in the industry

Makeup is a part of her life: 'This area has always been a part of my life. I've been working since I was seven. And as I got older and started working on my show [Wizards of Waverly Place], it was such an important part of my character,' she noted

'Because that's it. Similar to me posting a photo and walking away; for me that's it. I will do a red carpet, I will do whatever; I don't need to see it; I participated; I felt wonderful and that's where the extent of it is. 

'I don't care to expose myself to everyone and hear what they have to say.' 

The singer also told Cosmo that she has been wearing makeup since age seven.

'This area has always been a part of my life. I've been working since I was seven. And as I got older and started working on my show [Wizards of Waverly Place], it was such an important part of my character,' she said.

'And then music became a part of my life, and I realized [make-up] was crucial to the entire story of a music video.'

But then feels of insecurity came up.

'I started noticing when I would get to the place where I'd compare myself to other people or when I'd look in the mirror and think, 'Okay, what can I do to look this way?'' she admitted.
