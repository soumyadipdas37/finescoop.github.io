An Australian woman has shared the incredible bathroom ensuite makeover her 'handyman hubby' completed in 10 weeks - earning praise for its resort-style features.

The lady, who lives in New South Wales, revealed pictures of what her master ensuite looked like before and after the renovation on Facebook; exchanging the retro red tiles for a luxury grey and black matte finish. 

'From ugly to glam! My ensuite has finally been finished today. My hubby who is normally a plumber is now also a tiler and an electrician. So happy with the transformation,' she wrote.

BEFORE: The ensuite had a small shower, a matching red vanity with two sinks, large mirror and a window that faced the side of their house

AFTER: During the 10-week blitz, her partner fitted a bath, timber vanity and basin bought from Homegear in Sydney, before installing two curved mirrors and shower glass from Highgrove Bathrooms

The ensuite had a small shower, a matching red vanity with two sinks, large mirror and a window that looked directly out on the side of their house.

'I found my husband at the pub one night and decided he looked handy and married him,' she joked about the tradesman behind the overhaul.

During the 10-week blitz, her partner fitted a bath, timber vanity and basin bought from Homegear in Sydney, before installing two curved mirrors and shower glass from Highgrove Bathrooms.

'Tiles are sourced from a local tile shop and made here in Newcastle called Travatine Grey Matt and Gascogne Black Matt,' she said.

Decorative light pendents were secured from eBay and hung over the bath with a smaller window created to let light seep into the room.  

'All of the gold tapware is from Eagles Plumbing,' she continued.

She was initially worried the gold wouldn't 'work' with the other elements in the bathroom but she's happy with the outcome.

Many of the comments beneath the post praised the high standard of work, and her ability to find such a 'good man' at the local pub.

'Beautiful transformation and well done to your jack of all trades hubby!' Said another.

A third added: 'Looks great. Good thing you picked hubby up at that pub, he is useful to have around'.
