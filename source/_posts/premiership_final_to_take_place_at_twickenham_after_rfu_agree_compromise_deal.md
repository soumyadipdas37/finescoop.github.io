The Premiership final will take place at Twickenham next month after the RFU reached a compromise deal with the clubs over the staging fee.

As reported by Sportsmail, the clubs had voted against holding the Championship-deciding showpiece at the game’s headquarters due to the cost.

But after more talks between Premiership Rugby Limited and the RFU on Friday a solution has been reached whereby Twickenham will host the game on October 24 at a discounted price.

The RFU’s willingness to reduce their standard charge from £500,000 to £50,000 follows the growing acceptance that there will be no fans after the Government cancelled several pilot events this week.

The governing body are also understood to have been receptive to the strong feelings expressed by leading players that they wanted the domestic season to end at Twickenham, particularly after what has been an unprecedented campaign.

‘Rugby union is facing the biggest challenge in its history and we are fighting a battle for the future of the game,’ said PRL chief executive Darren Childs.

‘But we owe it to the clubs, players and management who have fought to reach the Premiership final that the culmination of the season is held at Twickenham.’
