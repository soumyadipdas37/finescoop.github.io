Jamie Spears is accusing daughter Britney's lawyer of 'grandstanding' by trying to unseal parts of her ongoing conservatorship case.

The 68-year-old says it's too soon for Britney to be making decisions about the future of her conservatorship and only the court can decide if she has the capacity to understand the consequences of making certain information public.

In court documents seen by TMZ Jamie accuses Britney's lawyer of making a show of trying to unseal the court documents at a time when the #FreeBritney movement is getting a lot of media attention.

Protecting her? Jamie reportedly wants Britney's medical records to remain sealed as he's concerned about the affect it could have on her if made public

Jamie says that before Britney can waive her right to privacy, it needs to be determined by the court that the singer has 'the capacity to understand the consequences of her waiver.'

Jamie reportedly wants Britney's medical records to remain sealed as he's concerned about the affect it could have on her if made public. He also reportedly wants to protect her two sons from the possible detrimental effects of the sensitive information going public.  

He also responded to Britney's lawyer's claim that she wants more 'personal autonomy' in her life. 

Jamie responded that the conservatorship is voluntary and Britney can file to terminate at any time but hasn't at any point. 

Earlier this month the singer's attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported on Thursday.

Britney's lawyer has also stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke',

The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers.

Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, according to TMZ. 

'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote. 

The outlet added that the Toxic singer said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye. 

Britney shares sons Sean Preston, 14 and Jayden James, 13 with ex Kevin Federline.

The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans. 

Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Womanizer crooner to be released from her conservatorship.

'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf. 

Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception, has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate. 

The court document stated of Free Britney: 'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.' 

That line seemed to be in direct response to an interview that Britney's dad gave last month in an effort to curtail the movement.

'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public,' Britney's lawyer said in court documents

'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told PageSix.

Adding: 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'  

Earlier this summer the Free Britney frenzy reached a fever pitch when a legion of her fans became convinced that her social media videos were old and being shared by her team to try to 'fake' that she is okay.

That prompted Spears to share a sort of proof-of-life post - a date stamped photo  - to assuage the concerned fans and show she isn't locked up and still has access to her phone. 

'Just so you guys know these aren't old ... check the date at the top of the 2nd pic!!!!' she wrote in the caption at the time.  

'The fact you need to post the date to prove she's real looks really suspicious...we all know someone's running the account,' wrote one person who wasn't placated by the attempt. 

This latest court filing is part of Britney's ongoing effort to have her father's legal control over career, finances and estate lifted or loosened.

Last month, her lawyers submitted paper work stating she was 'strongly opposed' to her father having control of her estate and finances, according to TMZ.

The why: A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing; she has not performed live since October 2018 (Pictured on tour in August 2018)

Instead the singer wishes for her temporary conservator Jodi Montgomery to take on the role permanently. 

Jamie was appointed as his daughter's conservator in 2008 following her very public breakdown. However, last year, he stepped aside from the role due to ongoing health issues.

A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing.

She has not performed live since October 2018 when she wrapped up the final legs of her Piece of Me Tour after concluding her Las Vegas residency on December 31, 2017.

Since then, she has been living mainly at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles, with her boyfriend Sam Asghari.
