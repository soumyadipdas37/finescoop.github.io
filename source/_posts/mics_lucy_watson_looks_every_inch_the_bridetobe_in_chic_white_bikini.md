Earlier in the week, the brunette beauty shared a sweet image next to her beau, 31, on a romantic boat trip and wrote in the caption: 'here's to forever,' accompanied by an engagement ring emoji. 

Toasting to the occasion with glasses of champagne, the vegan restaurateur enthused she was having 'the best day ever' as they watched the sun set.

The reality star's younger sister Tiffany, 26, congratulated the pair on their holiday engagement, and commented: 'SO HAPPY. Congratulations both of you.'

Her former MIC co-star Nicola Hughes, 30, added: 'I’ve been ecstatic all day. SO HAPPY.'    

Lucy and James have been going strong ever since meeting on the E4 series back in 2015.

Prior to her relationship with her husband-to-be, Lucy's ill-fated flings with Andy Jordan, Jamie Laing, Spencer Matthews and Oliver Proudlock all featured on the show.

The loved-up duo left the show just a year after embarking on a relationship and bought their first home in London in August 2017.

They spent nearly 12 months renovating their Victorian home, an experience Lucy previously insisted was 'great' for their romance.
