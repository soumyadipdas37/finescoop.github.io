Ready for some serious sparkle? As we spend more time inside, cleaning has become an even bigger pastime.

Whether you enjoy 'hinching' your home or dread dusting, Amazon has an abundance of hard-working household cleaning supplies that help make the process that much easier.

Ahead, we've handpicked five of the very best cleaning and mess-clearing solutions that Amazon shoppers and cleanfluencer Mrs Hinch, aka Sophie Hinchliffe, love to keep your home spotless and sparkling.

Mrs Hinch's favourite and beloved Minky cloth, which makes light work of all cleaning and washing up tasks, has over 1,300 rave reviews on Amazon. Shoppers say the dual-sided microfibre pad is a 'game-changer', 'better than sponges', and 'perfect for cleaning all around'.

Now on sale for just £4.66 - which is the lowest price we've seen on Amazon to date - the anti-bacterial cleaning pads from Minky make cleaning kitchens and bathrooms a breeze. They boast non-scratch technology so you don't need to worry about marks.

In a recent Instagram story, Mrs Hinch revealed how she uses this SonicScrubber Power Cleaning Brush to clean all the annoying nooks and crannies in her home, including the inside of her washing machine drawer compartment. It will get rid of the gunk in no time.

Forget reaching for an old toothbrush to clean your faucet or grimy grout, this electronic brush is a smart solution and does all the hard work for thanks to its oscillating head which moves 10,000 times a minute.

The brand claims it 'improves cleaning time by up to 57 per cent' - so it's not surprising the gadget has received over 3,200 glowing reviews on Amazon.

If you're in the market for a mop that doesn't flood your kitchen floor, we recommend the Vileda Turbo Microfibre Mop and Bucket Set.

Now 36 per cent off, the market leader has a unique foot-operated spin function to activate spin wringing, which allows for quick and easy clean up.

The household essential also features a 2-in-1 microfiber mop head suitable for all hard floor types including tiles, wood and laminate. Plus, the heads are machine washable so they can be used again and again.

From cleaning kitchen surfaces and greasy hobs to wiping down mucky oven doors, the bestselling Stardrops Pink Stuff Paste does it all. Even better, you don't have to spend a fortune for super sparkling results as it costs under a fiver on Amazon.

Another go-to cleaning product of cleaning guru Mrs Hinch, the Stardrios Pink Stuff Paste shifts dirt and marks from hard to clean surfaces. Apply a generous dollop of the Pink Stuff onto the area you want to clean, leave for up to ten minutes, then gently wipe away marks, dirt and stains.

Fans of the all-purpose cleaner on Amazon say it's 'amazing' and 'works like a dream', describing it as 'a fab cleaning product for tough strains'.

Don't underestimate the power of a decent squeegee. With over 19,000 reviews, the OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Squeegee is not to be sniffed at and will make cleaning a breeze.

The under-the-radar tool is the best of the best thanks to its ability to wipe your shower dry with no streaks in sight. It works well on mirrors, windows and tiled surfaces, and comes with a suction hook so it's easy to store.

Reviewers have described it as an 'essential piece of kit for a clean bathroom' and 'the only squeegee you will ever need in your life'.
