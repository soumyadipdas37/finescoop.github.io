Gemma has been able to showcase her weight loss in a range of social media snaps as she promotes her bespoke clothing range.

'[T]he countdown begins my beautiful luxury lounge wear designed by moi will be available from next week.' 

Talking to PlayOJO bingo on Wednesday, Gemma opened up about her weight loss journey, as she revealed: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it. 

'It is a full programme, you get nutrition advice, nice recipes and guidance and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to lose weight.'

The television personality has previously come under fire for promoting the jab, which 'regulate the glucose level in your blood, allowing your body to use your stored fat for energy'.

This means that you can safely consume small portions without experiencing the undesired effects of starvation mode.  

Gemma continued: 'My advice to anyone looking to start a weight loss journey would be adopt the right mindset.

'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective.'

Earlier this month, Gemma furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat'.

Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body.

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand.

'So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' 

Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.
