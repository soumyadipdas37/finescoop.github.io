Huge swathes of Australia will bask in sunshine and experience unseasonably high temperatures over the long weekend. 

Days of wet weather are due to come to an end as a trough brings warm air through Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia beginning on Friday. 

Parts of the country will hit 12C above the October average for the Labour Day public holiday on Monday.

East Coast residents will enjoy sunny weather over the long weekend with the Labour Day public holiday on Monday as temperatures hit 10C above the October average

In western parts of Sydney the temperature is expected to be in the high 20s over the weekend before climbing above 30C on Monday. 

Weatherzone meteorologist Graham Brittain told Yahoo News the heat will subside after the public holiday and NSW will see another week of rain.

Temperatures will drop substantially with a high of 23C forecast on Tuesday. 

Adelaide's peak will be on Friday with a high of 32C, which is 12C above October's long-term average.

'In Melbourne, Saturday will reach about 27-29 which is about 10 degrees above the October long-term average,' Mr Brittain said. 

Canberra is also forecast to have clear skies and warm temperatures across the weekend with the mercury reaching 26C on Sunday - 7C above average. 

The Bureau of Meteorology's Diana Eadie told Daily Mail Australia the peak will be on Saturday.

New South Wales will be the most significant state impacted as temperatures in Sydney and western parts of the city climb above 30C. Pictured: Coogee Beach in Sydney's east

'It's pretty unusual, Melbourne will be 28C on Saturday and Sydney will be 30C on Saturday and 28C on Sunday,' she explained.  

Central and southern parts of NSW are expected to be dry and regional parts of the state will see temperatures into the low 30s over the weekend. 

On the other side of the country, BoM predicts Western Australia will be 12C below average. 

Perth is expected to hit highs of just 20C, a stark contrast to last year's 31C on the same day.
