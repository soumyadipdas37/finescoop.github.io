Brielle Biermann defended a picture she took with stepfather Kroy Biermann after sitting in his lap during his birthday party.

On Sunday, the reality star, 23, posted a shot with her stepdad, who was celebrating turning 35, and her mother Kim Zolciak-Biermann, 42, at the Atlanta steakhouse Bones.

'HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most amazing father & man I’ll ever know,' the Don't Be Tardy star captioned the post. 'I couldn’t imagine a life without your hardworking, selfless, loving, caring self!'

She continued: 'I’m so proud of you and all you’ve accomplished we had too much fun last night i forgot to post yesterday love love you dad!'

When one user on the site asked Brielle, 'Why you sitting on your momma husband lap?' Brielle, who has 1.3 million followers on Instagram, explained there was no room to sit elsewhere.

'Honestly [because I] had [nowhere] else to sit we were making jokes the whole time about him being Santa it was comedy,' the Atlanta-born beauty responded.

Kim and Kroy, a former defensive player for the Atlanta Falcons, exchanged vows in November 2011, and less than two years later, in July of 2013, Kroy publicly said he'd adopted both Brielle and her sister Ariana.

Happy: Kim shared kind words about her husband's birthday on Instagram earlier this week

The Real Housewives of Atlanta alum and Kroy are also parents to kids K.J., nine, Kash, eight, and six-year-old twins Kaia and Kane.

Speaking with E! News in 2013, Kroy explained how the decision came as a result of prioritizing family in his life.

'In order to keep balance you have to have priorities,' he said. 'Our careers are our priorities, our kids, our health, our happiness ... before Kim and before the girls and before the boys, I lived a pretty regimented life.

He continued: 'I'd wake up, eat breakfast, go to work, come home…it was pretty normal. Now, my house isn't going to be as clean as it was before, but it's not important. Those things are not important and it's all about prioritizing and understanding.'

In her birthday wish to Kroy, Kim wrote, 'Happy 35th Birthday to the love of my life! We had so much fun yesterday I forgot to post!'

'Boy did I rob the cradle with you and I'm so glad I did! You amaze me daily somehow, someway... everyday. Although it is annoying that you know everything literally. You are the most INCREDIBLE DADDY on this planet, an incredible husband and I love every minute we spend together.'
