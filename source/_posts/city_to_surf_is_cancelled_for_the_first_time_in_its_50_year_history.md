The annual City2Surf run has been cancelled for the first time in 50 years because of coronavirus restrictions.

The organisers announced on Friday the iconic Sydney run 'will not be possible in 2020'.  

'Unfortunately, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current NSW Government restrictions on mass gatherings, a physical City2Surf cannot take place as planned on 18 October 2020,' organisers said.  

Instead, a City2Surf Virtual Run will be held in its place.

Runners are encouraged to run along their own neighbourhood streets.
