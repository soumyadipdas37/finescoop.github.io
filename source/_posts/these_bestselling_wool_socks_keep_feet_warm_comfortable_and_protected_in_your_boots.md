Whether you're wearing jeans and ankle boots, wellies, or your favourite knee-high boots, you'll need the best wool socks to keep your feet warm and cosy as temperatures start to drop.

Enter the YSense Women's Cotton Knitting Wool Warm Fall Crew Socks. Boasting more than 1,500 five-star ratings on Amazon, this five-pack of wool socks are a must for any boot-wearer.

Shoppers say the socks are 'comfy and warm', describing them as 'perfect for winter'. They come in ten sets of styles and colours, including muted neutrals, stripes, and fair isle patterns to complement whatever boots you're wearing.

And best of all, they cost a budget-friendly £9.99 for a pack of five - it's no wonder shoppers are buying several pairs.

The ribbed top socks are the number one bestseller in the retailer's Women's Socks category, and they can be found in the site's top 100 in clothing items, too. One shopper noted in their review: 'Perfect socks for boots, just the right thickness and height.'

'Put your best foot forward into these feet huggers,' wrote another reviewer. 'These socks are fabulous. The sizing is accurate and very well made - certainly value for money. Definitely a considered purchase should you want a robust, colourful sock.'

The socks from YSense are made with a wool, cotton and polyester blend, and customers say they feel incredibly lightweight and comfortable without sacrificing warmth. 

The one size fit for most (size from UK 4 to UK 8) socks are a hit among Amazon shoppers who have described them as 'comfy and warm' and 'perfect for winter'

One shopper described them as 'really warm and comfortable without being too bulky or tight'.

Another shopper said they're better quality than other more expensive options. They added: 'Brought for hiking as the proper hiking socks were not warm enough. They are probably the best socks I've ever brought!'

The only downside? Potential shrinkage. A reviewer wrote: 'Definitely do not toss these in the washer! They will felt and shrink.'
