A taxi driver who migrated to Brisbane from India is now living the Australian dream after buying a 52-acre grape farm in regional Victoria. 

Jaswinder Singh Dhaliwal arrived in Australia from Punjab in 2008 and began working as a cleaner and driving taxis.   

But after receiving his permanent residency in 2016, Mr Dhaliwal and his family decided to ditch the city life and relocate to Mildura, SBS Punjabi reported.

The family were on the hunt for 'any sort' of farming opportunity, which would allow Mr Dhaliwal to follow his passion for agriculture.

'I used to be a taxi driver in Brisbane. I was also involved in a cleaning business in Queensland for at least four years,' he told the publication. 

Mr Dhaliwal explained farming had been a tradition in his family for generations.

'I was very lucky that I found some local friends from the farming sector who helped and guided me to start this venture in Mildura,' he said. 

The father-of-two said there are 'huge' opportunities for people to try their hand in the farming sector in the Mildura.

The town of about 32,000 people is closely located to the New South Wales border and is about six hours north-west of Melbourne. 

The family quickly adjusted to the rural life after buying a 52-acre farm for the cultivation and harvesting of grapes.

'We are living a very peaceful life. Our family prefers rural life as compared to the hustle and bustle of the city. Moving here was a unanimous decision by our family and we have never regretted making this choice,' he said.

Mildura has all the facilities the family needs - including schools and a hospital - and Mr Dhaliwal's wife was able to find work. 

The farmer said his current career choice means he gets to spend more time with his children. The family are enjoying a 'prosperous, happy, and healthy' life.
