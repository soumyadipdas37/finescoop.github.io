The daughter of Australian sporting greats Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny had battled with alcoholism and an eating disorder before she passed away this week.  

Jaimi Kenny passed away at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father.

The 33-year-old had been supported by her parents and siblings through many years of treatment at private clinic End ED, on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.

Shattered staff at the clinic said they could not discuss Jaimi's struggle, but told how she became part of the 'family' over the years.

Despite her struggles with weight, friends of Jaimi told how she always brought 'light and laughter' to the lives of those she around her.

Her model brother Jett paid tribute to his sister on Tuesday, admitting that while he 'may not have been the best brother' they 'loved one another unconditionally'.

'I may not have been the best brother to you all the time, I know you thought you weren't being the big sister I needed all the time, but I do know we loved one another unconditionally all the time,' he wrote.

'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched.' 

End ED is located in the mountains surrounding the Sunshine Coast and provides an avenue of support for eating disorder sufferers and their families.

Among those to pay tribute to Jaimi in the wake of the news of her death was End ED clinician Millie Thomas. 

'You are my best friend and my soul sister and you always will be,' Ms Thomas wrote.

'My heart is shattered into a million pieces right now - I can't fathom life without you.

'My days will never ever be the same without your love, your light and your laughter.

'You mean the world to me darling heart and I will love you forever and always.' 

Lisa shared a statement just hours earlier telling of her family's 'unbearable' pain at the death of her 'beautiful daughter'.

'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' Lisa wrote. 

'So loved. So beautiful. So kind to everyone... So painful. I can barely breathe. 

'Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one,' Jett Kenny wrote on his emotional Instagram tribute to Jaimi on Tuesday

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself. Her love of flowers, cooking, art, decorating, photography, babies, the beach, and helping others will always be remembered.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child.'

Lisa's ex-husband Grant broke the news of their daughter's death on Monday with a public statement.

Jaimi was the couple's eldest child, and a sibling to sister Morgan and son Jett. 

Lisa and Grant married in 1986 and were one of Australia's most famous couples with both enjoying individual sporting success on the world stage.

But after their separation in 2019, Grant has since welcomed a fourth child with radio presenter Fifi Box, while Lisa married Elvis impersonator Mark Tabone in 2018.

Jaimi continued a close friendship with Fifi even after she separated from her father. 

Lisa's husband Mark Tabone also addressed the tragedy in an Instagram post on Tuesday.

'As the tears flow and the heart aches, I write this as a tribute to beautiful young lady, who's life ended way too soon,' he wrote. 



'Bright, caring and loving soul': The 58-year-old former competitive swimmer spoke of her 'unbearable' pain in a gut-wrenching Instagram post on Tuesday (above). Her post was interspersed with pink floral emojis - an ode to Jaimi's 'love of flowers'

Sad: 'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child,' Lisa said

Pillar of support: He thanked the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'

'As your mother and father weep your loss, I too feel lost and heavy hearted. Nobody should ever lose their child. 

'You always put everybody else first. You were gifted with many talents, amazing cook, arts and crafts, writing, and your love and creativity with flowers.' 

He went on to thank the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'.

The Curry-Kenny family confirmed Jaimi's death on Monday afternoon with a public statement.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read a statement from Grant Kenny.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'

Jaimi had just turned 33 in June, with her mother taking to social media at the time to wish her a happy birthday. 

'Our first born. Really... where have all those years gone! Have a lovely day bubba. We all love you so much,' Lisa wrote.
