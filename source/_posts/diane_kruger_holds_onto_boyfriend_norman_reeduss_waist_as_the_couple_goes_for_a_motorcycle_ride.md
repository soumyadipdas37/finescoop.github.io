They're doting parents to a baby girl who's almost two years old.

Diane Kruger and Norman Reedus were seen cuddling up while cruising on his motorcycle down the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California on Thursday afternoon.

The Inglorious Basterds star, 44, clutched the hips of her Walking Dead beau, 51, as the helmeted pair rode along on his white Triumph Tiger motorbike.

Kruger wore a yellow ochre top and shredded jeans while on the back of the bike.

Norman wore a t-shirt of the exact same color for the outing, along with a khaki vest and dark pants. 

Reedus wore Ray Ban sunglasses to protect from the wind, which Kruger lowered the clear visor on her AGV helmet.

Diane wore white Nike trainers while Norman was in black footwear. 

The couple, who've been together since 2016, were also seen shopping at Malibu store James Perse. 

The In the Fade star gave birth to her baby girl in November 2018, but she and Norman have decided to keep their daughter, as well as her name, out of the spotlight for the time being.

And while this is a first child for Kruger, Reedus is already father to son Mingus Lucien, 20, from his prior relationship with Danish supermodel Helena Christensen. 

Diane, for her part, has been in past relationships with Dawson's Creek star Joshua Jackson, and was married to French actor Guillaume Canet from 2001 to 2006.

Since entering quarantine, the German actress has been using her Instagram like a virtual day-to-day diary.

Last month, the blonde beauty stunned her nearly 1million followers when she posted a gorgeous full body snapshot to her Instagram Story.

Diane posed with her back to the camera and put her taut derriere on display in a red one piece swimsuit as she stood up on her tip toes with her hands in the air.

The National Treasure star will next be seen on the big screen in 355, a spy thriller costarring Jessica Chastain, Sebastian Stan and Penélope Cruz.

As of now, it's expected January 15th, 2021.
