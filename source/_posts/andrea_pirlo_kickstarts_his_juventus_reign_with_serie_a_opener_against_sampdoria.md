Andrea Pirlo's first league match in charge of Juventus will be at home to Sampdoria as he looks to guide the club to a record tenth successive Serie A title.  

Having announced on Tuesday that the season will commence on September 19, Serie A revealed every round of fixtures for 2020-21 just 24 hours later. 

Juventus start at home to Sampdoria before a daunting trip to the Stadio Olimpico to take on Roma. For Inter Milan, who look set to be Juventus' toughest challenger for the title, they begin their bid away to newly-promoted Benevento.

The release sparked lots of interest in when Pirlo and Conte will go head to head but fans will have to remain patient with the sides' first meeting not until January 2021. 

Lazio, who at the time of the stoppage for the coronavirus pandemic found themselves a point adrift of Juventus, will look to make amends for their poor end to last season with their opener against Atalanta. 

That could likely be pushed back due to Atalanta's involvement in the Champions League knockout rounds last month.
