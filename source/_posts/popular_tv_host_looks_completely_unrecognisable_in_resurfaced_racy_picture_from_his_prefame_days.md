Viewers know him as one of the regular guest hosts of Channel 10's The Project.

However, Tommy Little looked utterly unrecognisable in a picture from his pre-fame days, which resurfaced on Tuesday.

In the throwback image, the 35-year-old showed off his rippling six-pack abs as he went shirtless - a stark contrast to the slick suits he wears for work nowadays.

Tommy added to his barely-there look with a construction cap while his boxers peeked out from beneath his low-slung trousers.

The image stunned his fans after it was shared on the Carrie and Tommy Radio show's Instagram platform.

Tommy's former look was even more unrecognisable given that his arms didn't sport the plethora of tattoos he has now.

A little different! The image is actually that of host Tommy Little, 35, who is known for his suited and booted appearances on The Project

Having a bit of fun with their Instagram followers, they asked: 'Let's settle this... Tommy says this is a photo of him (pre-tattoos), but we don't see the resemblance.

'Tommy or Stripper?' they asked viewers who were left divided at the real identity of the man in the photo.

The comedian has been a popular figure on The Project since 2014.

Last month Tommy found out that his job at the Channel 10 show was safe after the network cut at least 25 jobs in response to the COVID-19 recession.

The Project and its hosts managed to avoid the swinging axe last week as the broadcaster announced a dramatic 'restructuring' of its news division, with the likes of Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Natarsha Belling and Tim Bailey being made redundant.

But many furious viewers have said that the left-leaning current affairs show, hosted by Waleed Aly and Carrie Bickmore, should have been first on the chopping block.
