Woah mama! Demi Rose was one again keen to put her best assets on display as she posed up a storm for a sizzling snap on Sunday

After many months in lockdown, Demi was making up for lost time over the weekend as she wowed in the sizzling snap which showed her curves. 

With her curves on full display, the brunette was hard to miss as she continued to enjoy her extended stay on the Balearic party island. 

In another snap, she reclined on a sunlounger, where she was sure to make the most of her cleavage while later turning away from the camera to flaunt her derriere.   

Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling.

Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.

Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.

Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.

'What is your bet that this will be over in June, July, August... What do you think, like never? Corona really f**ed us up, really majorly f**ked us up.

'I hope you're all staying safe and me... I am meditating, I'm trying to read a lot of books. Me and Teddy are really bored. I really want corona to f**k off, honestly.'

The bombshell was catapulted to fame when she became romantically linked to Kylie Jenner's ex, rapper Tyga.
