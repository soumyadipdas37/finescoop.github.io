In July, Amy outlined her reasons for her re-lactation, adding that Demelza 'preferred the bottle' and she had felt 'selfish' for breastfeeding as her family wanted to help with feeding. 

Posting on Instagram, Amy discussed why she felt compelled to return to breastfeeding. 

She wrote: 'Sooo many of are asking why I would want to #relactate after I mentioned it on my stories the other day....

'The answer is because firstly I genuinely miss #breastfeeding and only stopped because Dem preferred a bottle and my family all wanted to feed her so I felt selfish.' 

She continued: 'I will try to document but as always as a #firsttimemum I'm always scared to dish out advice before I've really done it as everything is a first.'

Amy announced she was expecting her first child with Daniel back in October, before welcoming Demelza in January.
