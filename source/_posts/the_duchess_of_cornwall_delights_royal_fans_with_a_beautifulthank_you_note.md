The Duchess of Cornwall has thanked her supporters for their well-wishes following her birthday - admitting that they were 'especially appreciated this year'.

Camilla, who turned 73 on July 17, sent thank you notes to royal fans who had taken the time to send their congratulations - with one delighted receiver sharing the message to her Instagram account yesterday.

The card included a snap of the duchess casually dressed in jeans with a blue sweater over a pink shirt, while posing on the steps outside her Scottish home of Birkhall.

Capturing Camilla reading All Change by Elizabeth Jane Howard, the photo was originally released by Clarence House in April when the royal shared her favourite reads for Easter.
