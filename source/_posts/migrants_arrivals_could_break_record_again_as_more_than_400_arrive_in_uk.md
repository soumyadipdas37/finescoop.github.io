Britain's migrant arrival record could be broken again today as 'more than 400' land in the UK as they rush to cross the Channel before weather changes.  

At least 27 boats were brought into the marina in Dover, Kent after migrants attempted the crossing following a quiet few days due to high winds in the Channel.

Border Force deployed extra resources as crossings resumed in earnest today, with boats containing as many as 30 people spotted in the busy shipping route.     

Authorities were forced to make use of lifeboats at 8am to collect those making the illegal crossing as Border Force vessels were already full to capacity.

Photographs from Dover captured dozens of people thought to be migrants wrapped in blankets and wearing life jackets as they arrived on British shores.

Young children were among those rescued by authorities on what an insider described as a 'very, very busy morning' for Border Force. 

Migrants are thought to have taken advantage of favourable conditions in the Channel, with wind speeds as low as 6mph early this morning. 

Today has been described as 'the last day of opportunity' before the weather turns on Wednesday, making conditions too difficult to attempt crossings.

There were no crossings over the weekend or on Monday as French authorities warned of strong northerly winds and strong currents.

But dozens of people were today spotted having to queue up and wait to be allowed ashore due to the volume of new arrivals.

Arrivals wearing face masks were also seen lining up along the side of Border Force cutter Seeker.

Seeker, which made a rare visit to the inner harbour to drop off the migrants, is part of a scaled-up contingent of Border Force vessels that have been busy in the Channel today.

In total, the agency has had at least five boats in operation: cutters Seeker and Searcher and patrol boats Hunter, Speedwell and Eagle.

A police boat has also been operating in the Channel along with the coastguard helicopter and the RNLI.

More than 6,500 migrants have successfully travelled to the UK aboard small boats in 2020, analysis shows.

September is the busiest month on record, despite there being over a week to go.

The current single-day record for migrant crossings is 416, set on September 2.

On Monday evening the first of up to 400 people were seen arriving at a military barracks that is being used to house Channel migrants.

Napier Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, has been selected by the Home Office to house migrants while their asylum claims are processed.

Staff in Folkestone were seen yesterday walking around the disused military base surveying the large open facility and its multiple accommodation buildings.

A member of staff wearing a Hi Vis jacket was seen pointing out where a shower block is going to be installed in the outside space between the housing blocks.

In the evening, around 30 people were rushed inside after arriving at the barracks in two black Mercedes and one grey Volkswagen.
