Amateur bakers are obsessing over an unusually simple recipe for Japanese chocolate marble bread that claims to be so straightforward, it's impossible to mess up - even for beginners.

Popular across Asia, the sweet, cake-style loaf is widely regarded as the softest and fluffiest bread on earth.

So perhaps it's no wonder that foodies are rushing to watch a video on YouTube cookery channel Akino Kitchen, which shows viewers how to make the bread in two easy steps: dough and chocolate filling.

And true to its word, the recipe is proving a hit among first-time bakers who say it has 'turned out amazing' every time they've tried it.

Japanese chocolate marble bread, widely regarded as the softest, fluffiest bread on earth

1. THE CHOCOLATE FILLING

To make the chocolate filling, bakers will need 10 grams of self-raising flour, 10 grams of corn starch and 10 grams of cocoa powder, which should be sifted into a bowl with 40 grams of granulated sugar.

Dry ingredients should then be whisked with 65ml of milk and heated in the microwave for one minute. 

Once heated, 70 grams of chocolate chips should be added to the bowl. The heat from the microwave will melt the chocolate into a thick paste.  

Next, the white of one egg should be whisked into the mixture, thinning it slightly, before 10 grams of butter is mixed in on top.

Finally, the rich chocolate paste should be spread in a layer - roughly 22cm long and 15cm wide - over a sheet of cling wrap, covered with a second sheet and refrigerated until needed.

Once cooked, the bread should be feather light and exceptionally soft, lightly browned on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside

2. THE DOUGH

For the dough, bakers will need to mix 250 grams of flour with 30 grams of sugar, three grams of salt, one whole egg and 155ml of milk.

The ingredients should combined into a thick dough which must then be kneaded on a chopping board and folded around 25 grams of butter.

The dough should be left in a large bowl covered with a sheet of cling wrap, which causes it to puff and expand by roughly three times its original size.

Once this has happened, the dough should be rolled out into a thin layer and folded over the chocolate sheet. 

INGREDIENTS

10g self-raising flour

The rolled out dough should then be sliced into three columns and twisted over and under each other, just as you would braid hair. 

Once braided, the dough should be lifted into a loaf tin and covered once more with cling wrap which will cause it to rise, stopping short of the top of the container. 

After it's risen, the dough should be brushed with leftover egg to ensure the bread turns golden brown in the oven where it must be baked for 25 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius.

Once cooked, the bread should be feather light and exceptionally soft, lightly browned on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside - ready to eat.
