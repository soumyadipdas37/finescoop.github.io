Craig Revel Horwood has revealed he had a crisis at the start of lockdown, worrying how he would be able to pay the bills. 

With Covid wreaking havoc in the performing arts sector, the television personality, 55, had to take five months off work, but is now gearing up for the upcoming series of Strictly. 

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Craig revealed he was filled with 'panic and anxiety' for a month about how he could afford to keep up with his affluent lifestyle.

The TV is estimated to make £110,000 per Strictly series and £180,000 from theatre work, including panto, and has two £1million homes. 

But with theatre having to close their doors over summer and for the foreseeable future, Craig said: 'I had a crisis at the start of lockdown thinking: How am I going to pay my bills? 

'It took me a good month to accept that this is reality and then it took me another month of panic and anxiety and just wondering how I am going to pay the bills and what is going to happen. It was just awful.

'I had to remind myself there are millions of people in the same boat and we all have to adapt and get on with it.

'It's been a good time to look at myself, it has been a good time to write and to get on with it. And actually achieve things I have had on a list of things to do for a couple of years.'

Craig also discussed his wedding plans. Gardener Jonathan Myrin, 35, proposed to the dancer in April during a trip to a national park in Tazmania. 

He said: 'I am taking the chance to plan the wedding, We are having to improvise a lot more than we are used to but I am forging on.

'We want to have it at home. A ceremony in the forest. It is such a beautiful position around here. It will be in about two years.'

He added: 'It is a good time to plan a wedding - even if it will be in about two years. And there is a lot! As anyone will know to wedding planning.'

Speaking about the new series of Strictly Craig told MailOnline: 'Strictly is going ahead which is really nice. It does make you feel Christmassy. 

'It is a bit later than it usually is but people will be ready for it. People really want it. 

'I think it is a good thing that the BBC have decided to go ahead and do it and have precautions in place.'
