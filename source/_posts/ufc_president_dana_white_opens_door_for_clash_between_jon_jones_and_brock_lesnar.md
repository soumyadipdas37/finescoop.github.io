Dana White is open to the idea of a seismic heavyweight showdown between Jon Jones and Brock Lesnar. 

Jones is moving up to heavyweight to take on champion Stipe Miocic but also recently called out Lesnar, a pay-per-view fan favourite and former WWE entertainer. 

'Bones' wrote on Twitter: 'Brock I'll beatcho a** too', and White threw his weight behind the idea. 

Jon Jones called out Brock Lesnar and Dana White is open to making the fight happen 

Lesnar last fought in 2016 and his win was made a no contest after a failed drugs test

The UFC president said: 'If [Jones and Lesnar] both want to fight each other, I'm sure it's a fight the fans want to see and it would be a good introduction for Jones into the heavyweight division.

'So, yeah if they both wanted to do it, I would do it.' 

Lesnar, 43, had his last MMA fight against Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in October 2016.

The former heavyweight champion's win was later overturned to a no-contest after he tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.

Despite his best years being behind him, fans would no doubt love to see Lesnar face the man many regard as the greatest of all time. 

White thinks a meeting with Lesnar would be a great way for Jones to start at heavyweight

Lesnar, 43, brings in huge pay-per-view numbers and remains a big name in the sport 

Jones has dominated the light-heavyweight division and after seeing Miocic beat long-time rival Daniel Cormier in their trilogy bout last month, is intent on moving up a weight class. 

Jones only has one blotch on his otherwise perfect copybook but that was a disqualification for illegal elbows rather than legitimate defeat. 

Lesnar meanwhile told White he'd retired from MMA back in 2019 but is understood to have always wanted the mega-fight with Jones so may yet reverse his decision. 

Francis Ngannou is front-runner to take on Miocic next, which may create an opportunity for Jones to take on Lesnar in the interim.
