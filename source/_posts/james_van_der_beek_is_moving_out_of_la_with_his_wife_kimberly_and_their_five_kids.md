It was not immediately clear where Van Der Beek and his family were headed to.

Kimberly took to Instagram Stories with a series of shots documenting the family's move, including shots from inside a moving van, and saying goodbye to their neighbors. 

Van Der Beek took to the site earlier this week with a message of optimism amid the uncertain times of the coronavirus pandemic and social change.

'There’s so much to be upset about right now,' he wrote. 'To all my activist friends - especially the ones fighting for causes that aren’t elective for them - be sure to take care of yourself. Get out in nature. Invest some time and energy in the people who love you.

Kimberly, 38, took to Instagram Wednesday with a series of shots documenting the family's move, including shots from inside the emptied house and a moving van 

'Remind yourself that there is still a goodness and order within this existence that transcends politics, skin pigmentation, man-made systems, viruses, and anything else that might generate a push notification to your phone.'

He continued: 'Then keep fighting the good fight. But be sure to love yourself first... enough to maintain a connection with what moves you and loves you back.'

Van Der Beek shot to fame playing Dawson Leery on the WB series, which also featured Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams. He's also been seen in Varsity Blues, One Tree Hill and CSI: Cyber.
