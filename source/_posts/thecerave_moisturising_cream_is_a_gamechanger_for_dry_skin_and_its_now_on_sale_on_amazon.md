If you're looking for reliable skin care without the bells and whistles, CeraVe is the brand to know. 

Affordable and dermatologist-approved, it's beloved for its kind and gentle formulas. A huge drugstore brand in the US, it has received plenty of well-deserved hype since coming to the UK in 2018. 

The powerhouse moisturiser CeraVe Moisturising Cream is a great place to start. What's more, it's now 25 per cent off on Amazon so you can snap up a tub for just £12. 

The hugely popular CeraVe Moisturising Cream is now on offer on Amazon for only £12

Whether you're on a budget or trying to suss out what works for your skin, CeraVe is well-worth checking out. 

The CeraVe Moisturising Cream is one of the brand's best loved and most popular products. The rich texture and barrier-restoring essential ceramides make this cream ideally suited to those with dry to very dry skin. If you suffer with skin conditions like eczema, this can help soothe the sore skin. 

Sensibly formulated, the CeraVe cream frequently tops the bestselling beauty charts. While it might not come in gorgeous packaging, the impressive ingredients like ceremides and hyaluronic acid make it a real powerhouse. 

With close to 2,000 reviews on Amazon, shoppers are impressed with the cream, with some even hailing it a 'moisturising master' and a 'game changer'. 

One reviewer commented: 'This cream is an absolute game changer! Within a month of using this everyday after a shower, my skin feels and looks the healthiest its EVER been! I didn't expect much from it but all I can say it try it for yourself!'

Another delighted shopper wrote: 'If you have sensitive skin it's pretty much a lottery with creams. But I was amazed with the results - in two days my skin settled down and pretty much normalised (from quite a bad state - I pretty much looked like I've stared inside the nuclear reactor core). More dramatic improvement even compared to steroid creams etc. Such a relief.' 

With essential ceramides to protect the skin’s natural barrier and hyaluronic acid to help retain skin's natural moisture, this cream described by shoppers as a 'moisturising master'

The fragrance-free, non-fussy formula can be used on the face and on the body so whether your face is suffering with lack of oil or if you've got cracked elbows this is promises to do the trick. And quickly. 

'This moisturiser made my skin less dry and irritated after 48 hours. I had previously been using skin products for combination skin and my skin had been peeling with dry skin and was very sensitive. I decided to try a product for specifically dry skin and I noticed a difference in 24 hours and within 48 my dry skin had nearly completely gone.'

Thanks to the rich formulation a little goes a long way so the 454g pot is sure to last you. Despite being a relatively thick cream, it's fast-absorbing so will sit well under makeup and won't clog the pores. Win win.  

'After spending and wasting so much time on different products and all others, this by far is the best cream and product I have bought and used. Fragrance free and you cannot tell at all you have this on or used it. Even if you wash your skin and face skin still feels smooth and silky. Doing wonders so far and skin hasn’t felt so good!'
