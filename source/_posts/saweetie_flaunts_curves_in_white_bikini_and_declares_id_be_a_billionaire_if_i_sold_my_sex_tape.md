She is already one of hip-hops fasting rising stars, though she has yet to release her debut album Pretty B***h Music, expected out later this year. 

But Saweetie seemed to be enjoying some downtime on Tuesday as she chronicled her day in the sun, showing off every inch of her curves. 

The 26-year-old My Type hitmaker shared a series of snaps in a white bikini to Instagram in fabulous summer style.

Posing in a white triangle string bikini, the Bay Area born star shielded her face in a large straw hat that left laser cut shadows on her face. 

With a large silver watch on her wrist and a thick cuban link chain on her neck she posed with one hand resting on her chest and the other securing her hat. 

She also leaned closer in to the camera, showing off her glamorous face of makeup with contoured eyelids and cheekbones, strong brows and large wispy eyelash extensions.

Continuing to document her bikini-clad adventures, she shared more videos to her Stories enjoying time in the shade and as she prepared to live-tweet on Rap Cavier's account. 

Earlier this year, the rapper (born Diamanté Quiava Valentin Harper) sizzled in a latex bodysuit for her July/August cover of Maxim, as she discussed her upcoming album and empowering with music. 

Saweetie is now the only rapper to ever be a Maxim cover star, an accomplishment she finds to be representative of her mission to encourage women.

Though her debut album has yet to be released she already has two platinum singles and reached the top 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

She started to gain attention after releasing her song Icy Girl to Instagram, which garnered a million views in the first week and was covered by MTV, XXL and the source. 

The song was followed up by her 2019 summer single My Type, which debuted on Billboard's Hot 10 chart, making her only the seventh female rapper to do so.   

Tap In, the lead single from her upcoming album has already become a sensation, after going viral with a dance on TikTok.

Rising star: Her album's lead single Tap In climbed the Billboard charts and earned her a Song of the Summer nomination at the VMAs, Post Malone, DaBaby, and Jack Harlow were tapped for the remix

The single was inspired by Too Short's hit Blow The Whistle, and by a routine she has with her Twitter followers telling them to 'Tap In' to a thread. 

It climbed the Billboard charts and earned her a Song of the Summer nomination at the VMAs, Post Malone,  DaBaby, and Jack Harlow were tapped for the remix. 

Of Pretty B****h Music, she said B***h is an acronym 'B***h means Boss, Independent, Tough, Creative and Hyphy. This is going to be a great moment for women. My music is empowering, inspiring, but it’s also fun.' 

Saweetie has been in a relationship with Migos star Quavo since 2018.
