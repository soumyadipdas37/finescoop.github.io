A furious Luis Suarez 'threatened to publish emails listing the clubs he was forbidden from joining' before Barcelona finally agreed to his Atletico Madrid move.

The Uruguayan striker is poised to join Atletico for £5.5million after the two clubs thrashed out an agreement on Wednesday night.

But not before Suarez reportedly wanted to disclose an email message Barcelona had sent him naming the clubs he could not move to for free. Suarez wanted to show that Atletico Madrid was not on there.

Atletico Madrid confirmed that they have agreed a deal to sign Luis Suarez for £5.5million

According to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo, Suarez's actions led to the speedy resolution of the deal with Barca's LaLiga rivals.

The 33-year-old is set for an emotional farewell press conference at Barcelona on Thursday ahead of his move to Atletico, where he has agreed a two-year contract.

It brings to a close a six-year stint at the Nou Camp in which he scored 198 goals in 283 appearances, winning four league titles, four Spanish Cups and the Champions League.

Suarez was informed back on August 24 by new Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman that he was not part of his plans for the season ahead.

Suarez had one year remaining on his contract but that would have been extended until 2022 had he played in 60 per cent of the team's matches this season.

President Josep Maria Bartomeu had left Suarez off a list of 'untouchable' players who wouldn't be sold this summer but were willing to supplement his salary at the club he joined.

However, an agreement listed a number of teams he couldn't sign for, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.

Suarez appeared to be bound for Juventus and flew to Italy for a language exam that would earn him Italian citizenship and a non-EU slot in their squad.

However, time ran out to complete the process and Suarez entered into talks with Atletico.

Bartomeu then tried to block the move, insisting he could not depart to Atletico for free.

However, Suarez has finally secured his move to Atletico for a £5.5m fee, raising the intriguing prospect of a striker partnership with Diego Costa.
