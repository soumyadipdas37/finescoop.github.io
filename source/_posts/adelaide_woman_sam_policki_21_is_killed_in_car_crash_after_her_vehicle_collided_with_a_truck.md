A 21-year-old woman has been remembered as 'a bright light taken too soon' after she died when her car collided with a semi-trailer on a highway intersection. 

Sam Policki was killed instantly while her passenger, who is believed to be her 25-year-old boyfriend, was injured in Bungama, just east of Point Pirie, in South Australia at 8:10pm on Sunday night.

SA Police believe Ms Policki was turning right from Warnertown Road onto the Augusta Highway when her Toyota Corolla collided with the truck. 

Shocking pictures from the scene show the Corolla was severely damaged while the truck appeared to have swerved off the road and into bushland after the crash.

The boyfriend was airlifted to Flinders Medical Centre with non-life-threatening injuries while the truck driver was uninjured. 

Ms Policki's distraught family and friends have begun to pay tribute to the young woman on social media.  

'A bright light taken put out too soon! Who would have known our visit last year would be the last time,' Ms Policki's cousin wrote. 

'I was blessed to be able to call you my cousin, you are one of the most beautiful souls I have had the privilege of calling family.'

'She was truly a beautiful person with the most beautiful personality... humbled and so sincere... always smiled... rest in peace our doll,' another family member wrote.

Meanwhile, one relative said: 'We've come such a long way my angel, you were like one of my daughters. Thinking of you.' 

Ms Policki's death is the 67th life lost on SA roads this year compared with 80 at the same time last year.

Major Crash Investigators attended the scene to examine the circumstances surrounding the crash.
