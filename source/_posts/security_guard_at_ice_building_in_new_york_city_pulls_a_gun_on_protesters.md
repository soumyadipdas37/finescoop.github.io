A security guard at a federal building for the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in New York City pointed a gun at protesters in a shocking threat caught on video.

On Wednesday a protest to abolish ICE unfolded in Manhattan following a whistleblower complaint that immigrant women detained in Georgia allegedly received hysterectomies without consent.

Demonstrators gathered inside the Jacob K. Javits Federal building at 26 Federal Plaza to decry the allegedly forced gynecological procedures where they raised their fists, chanted in unison and blared blowhorns.

Video from the protest shows the moment a female security guard brandishes a gun and points it directly at the protesters.

Protesters were rallying to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and stormed the lobby of the building on Wednesday. As they chanted the guard brandished the gun, pointed it threateningly, then put it away and waved protesters towards the door

The protesters shout even louder when they see the gun and the guard puts it back in its holster and waves for the crowd to leave the building.

The security guard works for the private firm Paragon Systems.

'It got intense. We are out here every day putting our lives on the line so that everyone else can be safe,' another guard said to the New York Post on Thursday.

Demonstrators left about 20 minutes after the gun incident. 

The Federal Protective Service, which oversees the security guards, said the incident is under investigation.

Protesters vandalized the building spraying 'Abolish' and 'Free them all' on the walls of the heavily fortified tower Wednesday. 

Many carried signs that said Protesters 'ICE & DHS agents of genocide' and argued with news photographers saying they weren't allowed to take their photos without their 'consent.'  

The doors to the building's Duane Street entrace were also smashed and covered with plywood on Thursday. 

On Monday a whistleblower who previously worked at an ICE facility in Georgia filed a complaint to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general saying 'mass hysterectomies' on immigrant women and alleged medical neglect unfolded there.

Dawn Wooten, a former nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, said in the complaint some women may have required a hysterectomy but 'everybody’s uterus cannot be that bad.'

She testified that the immigrant women were referred to one unnamed doctor outside the facility for the 'high rate of hysterectomies' and that a number of migrant women told her they were undergoing surgery without fully understanding why.

'Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy - just about everybody,' Wooten said. 'He's even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady.'

ICE said in a statement that only two immigrants held at the center had been referred to an outside gynecologist for hysterectomies since 2018.

The Office of the Inspector General has opened an investigation into the allegations.

'The accusations will be fully investigated by an independent office, however, ICE vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures,' Ada Rivera, the medical director of the Healh Service Corps said to the Wall Street Journal.
