'We are so excited to have Atlas here! It's been an amazing journey and we are feeling so thankful,' the Hubbards told People.

'Having three [children] under three [years-old] was not our plan, but clearly it was God's plan, and now we can't imagine it any other way. Liv is so excited and ready to meet her baby brother.'

The singer and guitarist, 33, also heaped praise on his wife, and women as a whole, for her strength in giving birth to their three kids in such a short span of time.

'With each delivery, I'm reminded not only of how amazing the birthing process is, but also how incredible women are for giving birth.'
