Gordon Ramsay's son Oscar proved he's inherited his father's dance moves as they took part in a viral TikTok challenge over the weekend.

In a cute video shared to Instagram over the weekend, the chef, 53, sang along to Nightcrawlers' Push The Feeling On, before jumping out of his car to showcase his fancy footwork.

The TV personality's youngest child, 17 months, was the spitting image of his father as he boogied in a puddle.

The clip kicked off with the outspoken star jamming to music in a car, before he leapt out of the vehicle and onto the beach to cut some serious shapes on the beach by his £4.4 million Cornish home.

Following in his footsteps, the toddler excitedly wiggled his arms and legs as he grooved to the hit track, which has been widely used for the famous Friday Dance challenge.

Gordon shares his baby boy, Megan, 22, Matilda, 18, and twins Jack and Holly, 20, with his long-term wife Tana, 46.

Earlier this week, the culinary artist revealed he's set to make his debut as a prime time game show host, as part of a new deal inked with the BBC.

He will front the new show – called Bank Balance – following a fierce bidding war between the BBC and rival network ITV.

 Gordon, whose production company Studio Ramsay devised the show, said of the upcoming programme: 'This is going to be truly epic.

'It is such an intense game with so much jeopardy to win big and lose even bigger, where the difference between failure and success is always in the balance.

'I’m so happy to be working with the fantastic team at the BBC and cannot wait to get in the studio and start stacking those gold bars!'

A press release describes Bank Balance as 'a high-stakes, high-pressure, game show where contestants need both knowledge and nerves to succeed, where they can literally build themselves a fortune or see it come crashing down in an instant'.

Kate Phillips, Controller of Entertainment Commissioning at the BBS said in a statement: 'It’s fantastic to have Gordon on board hosting this new prime time game show. It promises to test nerve, accuracy and knowledge as well as entertain you.'

Production on the game show is scheduled to kick off later this year. 

The father-of-five worked for free last year after deciding not to take any salary from his company's profits.

Gordon is the director of Gordon Ramsay Restaurants Ltd which includes eateries such as his three Michelin star Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.

A report filed to Companies House now shows that the chef didn't take any director's dividend from the profits which totalled £11.9million last year, reports The Sun. 

The restaurateur has an estimated worth of £200million and this was the second year he didn't take any dividend. However his fellow director Andy Wenlock was paid a wage of £417,000.

He also put in £7.4million of his own money as a 'loan' according to the report and has given 'personal guarantees totalling £5 million in respect of the Group’s banking facility'.
