British pop group Steps left fans devastated after they were forced to postpone their comeback tour amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But after teaming up with Australian singer Sia Furler for their latest album, What The Future Holds, it appears a 2022 Australian tour could be back on the cards.

'Performing live has always been our favourite part of being in Steps – we had the most fun of our career on tour,' they said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia.

The group - Claire Richards, Faye Tozer, Lisa Scott-Lee, Lee Latchford-Evans and Ian 'H' Watkins - were scheduled to play shows around Australia as part So Pop. 

Australia has been one of the groups biggest markets outside of the United Kingdom, where they will tour in November 2021.

'We're already planning for the next [tour] to be our biggest spectacle yet,' they added, hinting it will be full of surprises. 

'We will never forget the past with Steps, it's what made us, but we've got to look to the future too.'

Their forthcoming album, What The Future Holds, sees them reunite with writers including Fiona Bevan (One Direction, Lewis Capaldi), Ina Wroldsen (Shakira, Britney Spears) and Karl Twigg (who worked on their first three albums). 

The lead single, also titled What The Future Holds, was written by Greg Kurstin and Australian hitmaker Sia Furler. 

'[Sia] wrote the track for herself but realised it wasn't really for her and gave it to us,' reveals Claire.

'It's not like it was in the bottom of a drawer somewhere. It was her who said, ''We should give this to Steps because it would really suit them"'. 

Lisa gushed about the opportunity to work with the singer: 'I am such a huge Sia fan.'

'Her music is completely up my street, I have so much admiration for her as an artist and a songwriter so I'm in pop heaven.' 

Their sixth album, What The Future Holds, will be released on November 27.
