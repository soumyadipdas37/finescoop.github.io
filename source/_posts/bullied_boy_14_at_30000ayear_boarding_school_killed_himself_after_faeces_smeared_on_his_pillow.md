A bullied 14-year-old pupil at a £30,000 a year boarding school took his own life just days after cruel classmates smeared excrement on his pillow.

French-born Pierre DaCosta Noble was found hanged on the grounds of the prestigious Windermere School in the Lake District on November 9.

An inquest into his death on Monday heard Pierre would have been “deeply upset” by the pillow incident, which impacted his decision to commit suicide.

Cockermouth Coroner’s Court was also told how on a separate occasion the teenager had poo smeared inside one of his shoes.

Officials from Windermere School described Pierre, who joined as a boarder in Spring 2019, as a 'model student'.

But the court heard he had told friends he was not enjoying his time at there.

Paul Ainsworth, a physics teacher and house master of Pierre, said: 'Someone had put excrement in his boot and smeared it on the inside of his pillow.

Windermere School in the Lake District charges £30,000 a year and was attended by Pierre

'We found it odd that he was targeted as he was well liked.'

Describing the night Pierre died, Mr Ainsworth said he went missing when it was time for the boys to go to bed.

The inquest heard he signed out just after an evening meeting at around 8pm and had not returned.

Mr Ainsworth said he thought Pierre would either be in a friend’s block or speaking with his parents on the phone so asked a couple of senior boys to look for him.

The hearing heard the two pupils returned visibly upset after finding the Year 9 student hanged.

Mr Ainsworth tried to resuscitate Pierre until the emergency services arrived and took him to Royal Lancaster Infirmary, where he was later pronounced dead.

The house master said he did not follow normal protocol, to raise the fire alarm when a child goes missing, due to concerns it would cause Pierre more distress on what was already a difficult week.

The coroner asked Joanna Parry, deputy head of pastoral care at Windermere School at the time, whether he made the right decision.

She said: “I believe he made a good decision. He did not know what the students were going to find when they went out,”

A multi-agency report into Pierre’s death had originally said the excrement incident had no impact on his decision to take his own life.

But Jennifer Davies, head of safeguarding at Windermere School, told coroner Andrew Tweddle she no longer thought it had come to the right conclusion. 

Headteacher Ian Lavender was asked by the coroner why he never had any face to face interaction with the student.

He explained there was a system in place and that he was aware of the incident, classed as bullying, but would only be involved himself further down the line.

Mr Lavender added: “I deeply regret that I did not get involved with the matter sooner.”

The coroner said: “It is clear what his intentions were. It is my conclusion that Pierre did deliberately intend to take his own life.”

Windermere School is a 157-year-old independent, coeducational boarding and day school in the Lake District with 350 students.
