Keeping all eyes on her look, she added a flick of black eyeliner and a hint of gloss. 

Captioning the snap, she penned: 'She's busy.'  

On Friday Maya revealed a sneak peak of the Don't Hate The Playaz Halloween special with a striking feline look to her Instagram Story. 

Turning up the glam, the star showcased a full smokey eye complete with spider web detailing and hand-drawn bats.

Wow: In a black vinyl jacket and a sleek high ponytail, Maya added: 'I want to save the big reveal for actually Halloween but I just cannot get over'

She added: 'Just to give you guys some context we were just filming the Halloween special episode of Don't Hate The Playaz.'  

The filming comes after Maya graced the cover of Wonderland Magazine for a sensational new shoot with an accompanying interview detailing her feelings on the industry and how she will struggle with acting 

Maya said: 'I definitely think I'm resilient. Sometimes I surprise myself, because there's been a few times...

'I feel like oh my God, this is the end of the world — and then it's not the end of the world. And then I'm back.'   

Maya also recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it's like, 'This is this, it's everybody's business'. 

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heavy Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire.'
