Ramy Youssef just shared a surreal moment from this year's virtual Emmy Awards.

The writer/actor revealed what happened behind the scenes of the coronavirus-proofed, at-home ceremony in a hilarious video on Instagram Monday. 

'When u lose the Emmy,' Ramy, 29, wrote below a clip of people in tuxedo-inspired hazmat suits waving goodbye while waiting outside of his house with one of the coveted trophies.

Absurd: Ramy Youssef shared what happens when you don't win an Emmy these days, revealing a hazmat suit-clad awards employee waving goodbye while walking away with the coveted trophy

It looked like the very protected Emmy employees had been hovering outside of the Hulu favorite's house.

But when the winner was announced, it was 'Au revior' to Ramy. 

Youssef was a bit of a favorite in the category, already having taken home last year's Golden Globe for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy.

But he lost the Emmy for Lead Actor In A Comedy Series to Eugene Levy of Schitt's Creek.

The Canadian series was one of the evening's big winners, earning trophies in six Primetime categories.

No dice: Youssef was a bit of a favorite in the category, already having taken home last year's Golden Globe for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy. He lost to Schitt's Creek star Eugene Levy though

It looked like the very protected Emmy employees had been hovering outside of the Hulu favorite's house before saying 'Au revior' when the real winner was announced

Struggle: Samantha Bee struggled to get into a mystery box that could have contained an Emmy or a consolation prize

The at-home awards reveal was a little different - but equally as absurd - for late night talents Samantha Bee and John Oliver.

Both were gifted with a 'mystery box' which held either an Emmy or a bottle of champagne as consolation.

The Last Week Tonight With John Oliver host emerged triumphant, plucking a trophy from the beautifully crafted box after being winning Outstanding Variety Talk Series.

But Bee had a bit more trouble with her box, sharing her struggle on social media.

After spending several minutes trying to pry it open, she finally extracted a smaller mystery box that with a bottle of champagne inside.

Interesting: While the Full Frontal With Samantha Bee host was surprised to find a bottle of champagne inside, she tried to hide a grimace after learning the Trenton, New Jersey-produced of bubbly retails for $28

Though Samantha was gracious for the consolation prize, the glow didn't last for long.

She tried to mask a grimace after reading the label and finding out the Trenton, New Jersey-produced of bubbly retails for $28.

Last night's Emmys were radically different that the usual affair, as producers tried their hardest to create Hollywood's first major pandemic-era awards show.

Late night funnyman Jimmy Kimmel hosted from the empty Staples Center in Los Angeles while winners beamed in from the safety of their homes, skipping the red carpet fanfare.
