There's one thing that unites most households across the country - and that's the biscuit tin.   

Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI) has carried out a blind taste test to reveal the best biscuits on the market - and with categories such as rich teas, chocolate chip cookies, bourbons and custard creams, as well as chocolate and regular digestives - there's sure to be something for you.

Galaxy’s Chocolate Chip Cookies, £1.99, placed not only best in its individual group category, but was also the overall winner of the best biscuit taste test. 

Meanwhile, the top-rated infamous sandwich biscuit went to M&S’ Custard Creams (£0.35 for 200g), which was also the second-highest ranked biscuit in the competition.
