Spencer Matthews has told how he was motivated to quit drinking as he believed his wife Vogue Williams may have left him if he didn't.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 32, explained that he had to put his wife, 34, first and so quit his alcohol habit for good. 

Speaking on a Tap Into Success webinar for Nicorette, Spencer said: 'There was a really good chance that my wife would have left me if I carried on drinking the way I was drinking. For the first time in my life I put her first. 

Honest: Spencer Matthews, 32, has told how he was motivated to quit drinking as he believed his wife Vogue Williams, 34, may have left him if he didn't

'Usually the old me would have said, "Do you know what? Fine. If you don't like it then get out." I had this really kind of selfish "me before anyone else" streak before.

'When I realised I cared more about her than I do perhaps myself, and that I was making her see less in me, that gave me a real burning desire to be better for her, initially.'

Spencer and Vogue married in Glen Affric, Scotland in June 2018 and the couple are parents to son Theodore, two, and daughter Gigi who was born in July.

The TV star, who has his own line of non-alcoholic drinks, added: 'I feel like we have the most wonderful relationship. I can hear that she respects my opinion and respects me as an individual, and that is worth its weight in gold to me.'

It comes after Spencer previously revealed he had to give up alcohol after his drinking habits became 'unsustainable' ahead of his wedding to Vogue. 

He told The Times: 'My relationship with alcohol became unsustainable. For people who are going to ask, "Were you an alcoholic?" I suppose the short answer is "Yes."

Admitting that alcohol "disturbed his thought process," he added: 'I would never wake up the following the day feeling like I should be in a body bag, but my functionality, my decision-making, my creativity would be impaired.

'I would be all on or all off. I'd give up for three months and feel incredible. But for some reason I'd always go back to it. 

Opening up: Spencer previously insisted he had to give up alcohol after his drinking habits became 'unsustainable' as he prepared to marry Vogue (pictured in November 2019) 

'Moderation was impossible for me. People close to me wouldn't have thought that I had a drinking problem because it wasn't evident although towards the very end of my drinking perhaps it became a little bit more of an issue.'

The former Made In Chelsea star previously admitted that become a father to son Theodore made him reassess his priorities and says 'my wife and son are my world.'

Taking to Instagram in November, Spencer said: 'Sobriety is a lifestyle choice I made a few months before becoming a dad.

'In the back of my mind for many years, I had always felt that my relationship with alcohol, although seemingly harmless was unhealthy and somewhat destructive.

'My relationship with alcohol was destructive': Spencer previously discussed his decision to become sober before becoming a dad 

'Drinking lead me to make poor decisions and achieving my full potential was slipping away.

'I had abstained from alcohol for lengthy periods at a time but in doing so had made drinking at the end of that period a reward - a pat on the back for my achievement. It was a vicious cycle...'

Spencer said that becoming a dad meant he had to change his ways.

He said: 'I had to change my relationship with alcohol in order to become the man that I knew I could be and that my family would be proud of. Sobriety has opened my mind and unlocked parts of me that I didn’t even realise existed.

He said: 'In the back of my mind, I had always felt that my relationship with alcohol, although seemingly harmless was unhealthy and somewhat destructive' (pictured in 2014)

'I am more ambitious and hard working now than I have ever been and there has been a serious shift in my priorities and what’s important to me.

'My wife and son are my world and being there for them in every way possible is the only thing that matters to me... that and my work...

'Over the last year and a half I have learnt an awful lot about the low and no alcohol sector and what it has to offer and have developed a business to compete in that sector at the highest level.

'If you are sober curious, we are for you. I’m incredibly proud to invite you to follow and join us in discovering a different way to drink. Cheers to that!'
