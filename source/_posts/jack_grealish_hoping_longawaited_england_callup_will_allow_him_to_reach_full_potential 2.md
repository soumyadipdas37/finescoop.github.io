Jack Grealish has described England's players as the 'best in the world' after being called up to Gareth Southgate's squad to face Iceland and Denmark in September.

The 24-year-old has received full international recognition for the first time after Marcus Rashford and Harry WInks withdrew from the Nations League squad on Monday.

Now the Aston Villa midfielder, who saved his boyhood club from relegation on the final day of the Premier League season, believes working alongside the best players in the country will enable him to reach his full potential. 

Jack Grealish believes playing alongside top internationals will help improve his game

The Villa captain told The Sun: 'I believe in my own ability and I'm confident I can perform at international level.

'But I also want to improve and I'm eager to learn what it takes to be a success at this level.

'If anything, I believe the better the players you play with or against, then the better you will perform yourself. I've always believed that.

Grealish registered 10 goals and eight assists for Aston Villa in all competitions in 2019-20

'When you look around the England squad, they are not just the best players in the country — they are the best in the world.'

Grealish was a surprise omission from Southgate's original squad after performing as one of the Premier League's most creative midfielders last season, registering 10 goals and eight assists in all competitions.

In explaining his decision not to select the 24-year-old, Southgate said he viewed Grealish as a forward — rather than a midfielder — meaning he was battling with attackers such as Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Raheem Sterling and Mason Greenwood.

Grealish first represented Republic of Ireland as a youth international but will bid to make his senior England debut when they take on Iceland on Saturday, September 5, before facing Denmark on Tuesday, September 9.
