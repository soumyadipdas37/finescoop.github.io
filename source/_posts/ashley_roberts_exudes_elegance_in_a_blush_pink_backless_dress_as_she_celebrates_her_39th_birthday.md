She is celebrating going into the last year of her thirties.

And Ashley Roberts made sure she turned 39 in style and was every inch the birthday babe as she left the Global Radio studios in central London on Monday morning after her Heart FM show.

The former Pussycat Dolls singer looked incredible in a blush pink silk midi-dress by Reiss featuring an elegant backless design as she sashayed to her car after being spoiled with cake and champagne.

The radio presenter teamed her striking gown with nude stiletto heels and toted an off-white leather Saint Laurent handbag.

Ashley sheltered her eyes from the September sunshine with a pair of pearl-rimmed shades and had a huge smile on her face as she emerged from the studio. 

The broadcaster wore her blonde hair straight and opted for natural make-up to accentuate her striking looks.

Despite having to work on her birthday, Ashley seemed to be having a ball and posted an Instagram video as she twirled around the studios.

The singer and dancer seemed thrilled as she was spoiled with numerous cakes and boozy treats from her Heart FM 'family'.

Ashley shared an Instagram video showing a caterpillar cake, a sumptuous-looking white chocolate creation, a bottle of Taittinger champagne and Hypnotiq fruit liqueur to kick off her day of celebrations. 

The star's birthday appearance comes after she revealed she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. 

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine in July, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 30.

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. 

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.' 

Ashley previously revealed she tried to freeze her eggs a couple of years ago, but the process didn't work.

No pressure: Ashley previously revealed she tried to freeze her eggs a couple of years ago, but the process didn't work

Speaking on her Heart Breakfast show in January, the singer and dancer admitted it was a 'tough' experience to go through. 

Ashley said: 'I tried to freeze my eggs actually a couple of years ago, and I had the bruises and was injecting my stomach and it's awful.

'Yeah, all the hormones and everything. It actually didn't work for me which I wasn't fully aware that that could even happen... it's a tough time.'

Freezing allows women to store their eggs at a young age so they can be used in IVF when they want a family. This gives a greater chance of conceiving as the quality of the eggs they produce as they get older gradually deteriorates.

Fewer than a fifth of women are able to have a baby after using frozen eggs, according to the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).
