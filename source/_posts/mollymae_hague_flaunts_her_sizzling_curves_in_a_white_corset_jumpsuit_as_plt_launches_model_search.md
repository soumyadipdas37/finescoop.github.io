She's released several fashion collections and signed another six-figure deal with PrettyLittleThing earlier this year.

And Molly-Mae Hague, 21, looked sensational as she modelled a white jumpsuit with a stylish corset detail during a recent shoot for the online brand.

It comes as PLT announces that they're looking for five 'next level babes' to become the new faces of the brand and work alongside the existing model squad.

Molly-Mae flaunted her curves in the figure-hugging jumpsuit, which boasted a plunging neckline to accentuate her ample assets.

The beauty tied her long blonde locks back into a sleek ponytail and and kept her accessories to a minimum with a pair of clear heels.

During the shoot Molly-Mae also slipped into a pair of wide-leg jeans with rips over the knees and flashed her taut midriff while lifting her grey jumper.

While in a third stylish look, the Love Island star wore a light grey t-shirt with a ribbed detail under the bust and a silver chain necklace.

The sizzling snaps from Molly-Mae's shoot come as PLT announce they're launching an UK and Ireland wide search for the next faces of the brand in October.   

Speaking exclusively with MailOnline, the company explained how they're looking for five 'next level babes' to represent their brand.

PLT said they're after diverse individuals who aren't afraid to be themselves, standout and who exude beauty inside and out.

The lucky winners will receive a prize valued at five figures which includes a one-year contract with newly-launched The Four Model Management and the chance to be the face of a PrettyLittleThing campaign.

Poser: Molly-Mae added a full face of makeup including a slick of brozer and a nude lipstick to accentuate her pretty features

This global campaign will give the winners a chance to be seen by millions and include a two-day location shoot with the rest of the winning model squad. 

The winning models will also be treated to a press and influencer dinner to celebrate the campaign launch.

To be in with the chance of launching into model stardom, hopefuls have to submit a maximum for four pictures. PLT said a mixture of head and full length shots would be preferred but not essential.

However a major factor in the application is that no filters or editing can be used on the submitted images – the brand is after natural beauty.

Alongside the competition, PrettyLittleThing founder and CEO Umar Kamani is launching a new agency Four Model Management.

The modelling agency will be based in Manchester, with Umar saying he's 'incredibly excited to bring to life our new agency'.

The businessman said: 'We plan to become the next generation of modelling agencies and will bring the next level of diverse, inclusive and freshest faces to the table.' 

While a spokesperson for Four Model Management added: 'With the industry changing at such a fast pace we rely on our experienced staff members to be one step ahead at finding the NEXT TOP THING. 

Style: Molly-Mae has launched several collections with PLT and recently signed another six-figure deal with the online fashion brand

'As a global management we aim to represent the strongest and most diverse individuals all over the world ensuring they have the correct care, management and support in the industry. 

'The Four aims to launch the most explosive vibe to the model world ultimately becoming the next new powerhouse in the game!' 

The announcement comes after Molly-Mae recently revealed that she was giving away a massive haul of goods – including Louis Vuitton bags – as she celebrated garnering 1million YouTube subscribers. 

However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.

As the complaints ramped up on the site, the reality star clapped back and wryly tweeted: '£10 to any boy that's not tweeted '£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae's giveaway'..... terms and conditions apply x.'

However, Molly-Mae later revealed on her Instagram Stories that the negative comments had hit a nerve. 

She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always. 

'I'm one of those people that do tend to read things and I do tend to let it get to me.

'But I just made this giveaway for something for us all to enjoy together, a way that we can celebrate having a million subscribers together and also a way for me to give back was the main thing.  

'I wouldn't have any of this stuff without you guys, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I do. Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.' 

Can't believe it: It comes after the blonde beauty revealed the winner to her £8k giveaway on Instagram
