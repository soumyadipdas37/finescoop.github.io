Married At First Sight star Martha Kalifatidis revealed on Thursday that she's constantly inundated with unsolicited d**k pics from her Instagram followers. 

The 31-year-old reality star filled in for Jackie O on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show when she was asked by a listener if she receives any dirty images. 

Martha, who boasts 346,000 followers, said she receives the images constantly but finds them 'disgusting.'

The former makeup artist also revealed that she prefers men who are 'well-groomed.' 

'Yeah, I get a few gorgeous d**k pics,' Martha said sarcastically. 

Shock jock Kyle Sandilands probed her, asking: 'You like them? I thought some girls didn't like them?'

Martha then fired back, saying they're 'disgusting.' 

'As if I like them, they're disgusting,' Martha said. 

'They're usually guys who aren't groomed. I've been very spoiled and I always choose to be with a really groomed guy. It's quite confronting...hairy.'

She added that the pictures are always too bright as well.

'You don't want a flash in it, maybe some candlelight, not like the theater light!'

She added that she never replies to the followers and 'blocks and deletes' them.
