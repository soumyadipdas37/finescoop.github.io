Two young girls have been orphaned after their 'utterly devoted' parents were killed in a head-on car collision. 

Robert Bateman, 36, and his 35-year-old wife Paula died when their Ford Focus was in collision with an Iveco Daily van on the A142 between Chatteris and Mepal in Cambridgeshire. 

Their daughters Lexi, 10, and 18-month-old Elizabeth were also in the car when it crashed just after 8pm on Thursday. 

Robert Bateman, 36, and his 35-year-old wife Paula died in a head-on collision in Cambridgeshire. Their daughters Lexi, 10, and Elizabeth, 18 months, were also in the car and have been discharged from hospital

Elizabeth suffered minor injuries while Lexi had serious but not life-threatening injuries. Both have since been discharged from hospital. 

Cambridgeshire Police said the van driver, a 32-year-old man from Lincoln, was arrested on suspicion of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and driving while unfit through drink or drugs. 

He suffered minor injuries and remains in custody. 

In a tribute issued through police, the family of Mr and Mrs Bateman, from Manea in Cambridgeshire, described them as 'utterly devoted parents'.
