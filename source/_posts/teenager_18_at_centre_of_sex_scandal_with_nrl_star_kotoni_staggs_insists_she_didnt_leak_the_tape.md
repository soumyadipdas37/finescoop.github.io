A Brisbane teenager accused of releasing a sex tape involving Brisbane NRL player Kotoni Staggs says she never intended for the video to go public.

McKenzie Lorraine Robinson, 18, appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday facing a single charge of distributing a prohibited visual recording.

The woman from Brisbane's Newstead suburb allegedly shared the recording of Mr Staggs between June 14 and August 5 without his consent, according to court documents.

Outside court, defence lawyer Jason Jacobson insisted the teenager did not post the video on social media.

'It was not Ms Robinson that made this private video go public,' he told reporters.

'That was never intended by her and she very much regrets that it did and she very much regrets the impact that it caused for Mr Staggs.

'There is an explanation as to how this happened and that will be put to the court at a later date.'

Despite the embarrassment for the Bronco, Staggs was cleared of any wrongdoing by the NRL's integrity unit after the video was released.

Robinson's case was adjourned for mention on September 30.

She was granted bail on her own undertaking.

Robinson reportedly messaged the Brisbane Broncos star on Instagram before the pair met up and slept together soon after. 

Robinson allegedly asked the 21-year-old if she could film the sexual encounter on her mobile phone, saying she could be 'trusted', according to The Courier Mail.

Staggs alleges Robinson, who describes herself as a 'holistic wellness coach,' repeatedly called and messaged him following their rendezvous.

She allegedly also asked the NRL star if he would have a threesome with her and a friend.

Staggs is believed to have asked Robinson to stop contacting him weeks before the video was released. 

He made a complaint to police after the video surfaced, claiming it was released without his consent. 

The 18-year-old has shared several scantily-clad photos of herself on social media, where she writes that she is 'dedicated to empowerment and love'.

'I am a (sic) empath and have a huge high energy connection to the universe through crystals, meditation, aromatherapy and oracle readings,' a post on her Instagram reads. 

Staggs' lawyer Dave Garratt  previously told the Courier Mail his client praised Queensland Police for their handling of the mater.

'Mr Staggs is extremely embarrassed and disappointed that his private life has been brought into the public domain,' Mr Garratt said.

'It has caused embarrassment to him, his family and the club and he is hoping to put this behind him now and leave it with the authorities.'
