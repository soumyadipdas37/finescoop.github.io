A fed up 'boomer' has left a sarcastic note in his neighbour's letterbox after he was kept up all night by a raging house party in one of Perth's most affluent suburbs. 

The Bell Tower Times shared the note on its Facebook page, admiring the 'impressive levels of neighbourhood pettiness.'

It's understood the note was sent by a frustrated homeowner in Wembley Downs after a string of loud parties by a younger neighbour.

The typed note highlights the fact the man will be 'unlikely to apologise for having another party with his parents away' and 'for keeping others awake until 3am'.

One Facebook user jokingly stated 'no sleep makes boomer something something' while another admired 'the level of trolling some people have'

Having every reason to feel aggrieved, the typed note also states he also 'won't apologise for calling the police with a noise complaint' or that he 'doesn't care that his neighbour is sleep deprived.'

He concludes his brilliant rant by encouraging him 'to email Dad to let him know how it felt to be kept awake to all hours.'

The term 'OK boomer' has become a popular catchphrase typically used by teenagers and young adults.

The derogatory phrase is adopted by younger generations to show their indignation towards older people, typically those born after 1945, who are dubbed 'baby boomers.'
