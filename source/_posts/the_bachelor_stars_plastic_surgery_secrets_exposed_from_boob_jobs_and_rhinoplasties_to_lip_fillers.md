The Bachelor and plastic surgery have always gone hand in hand. 

And Locky Gilbert's season is no exception, with several stars confessing to undergoing dramatic procedures to transform their looks.

On Monday, Juliette Herrera confirmed rumours she's gone under the knife to enhance her figure, telling New Idea she's had a breast enhancement.

'I wanted bigger boobs... that's it', she said when asked about her surgeries. 

Indeed, throwback photos show the 34-year-old stylist looking completely different to how she appears today.

Several photos show her with thinner lips, less defined cheeks and a much smaller cleavage, which suggests she's undergone multiple enhancements.

The Bachelor contestant's upper lips appear to have doubled in size in recent years, possibly due to non-surgical lip fillers.

Despite her young age, Juliette may have also undergone Botox to prevent wrinkles from forming on her forehead.

Meanwhile, eliminated contestant Marg Zogoulas, 23, told New Idea that she previously underwent a rhinoplasty.

However, photos of the beauty blogger's face prior to her nose job appear to have been scrubbed from her public social media pages.

Charley Bond has also been forthcoming about her transformation over the years. 

While she has not gone under the knife, the physical education teacher, 25, did upgrade her smile with the help of cosmetic dentistry.

'Absolutely LOVE my teeth now!' she wrote in her post.

Several contestants have also admitted to changing their looks with injectable treatments rather than surgical procedures.

Areeba Emmanuel, 25, told New Idea on Monday that she 'had her lips done once', while Zoe-Clare McDonald, 23, said she received lip fillers when she was 19 but had them dissolved a week later. 

Meanwhile, Kaitlyn Hoppe, 26, told the publication she's had 'just a bit of Botox'.
