She loves to make fashion statements during her morning walk to work.

And Ashley Roberts opted for something a little more casual when she headed across Leicester Square to start her shift at Heart radio on Friday. 

The Pussycat Dolls star, 39, looked incredible wearing a monochrome ensemble from Serena Bute London and £705 Gucci trainers.

Her ensemble came with a designer price tag, with her 100% silk shirt coming in at £325 and her flat-fronted joggers ringing in at £365. 

On top of that, Ashley carried a YSL cream handbag on her wrist, which retails for £1580., not to mention those designer sunglasses.  

Ashley found herself alone in the studio at first due to social distancing measures and sang about the joys of it being Friday on her Instagram Stories.

'There's totally nobody in' she said as she belted out some notes. 

She then showed off her full outfit as she posed against a wall with a cup of tea in hand.

On Monday night, Ashley stepped out for dinner at La Famiglia in Chelsea to mark the milestone of her 39th birthday. 

Referencing her birthday,: 'Ring Ring: Alexa says it’s 30 degrees and my birthday hunni’s. Thank you for all your lovely messages!!!'

The post prompted an inevitable wave of positive comments from fans, among them former Strictly Come Dancing champion Stacey Dooley, who wrote: 'WELL WELL WELL, happy bday sis.' 

Earlier that day Ashley admitted she had been spoiled with cakes, champagne and cards from her extended family at Heart Radio after turning up for her role as showbiz correspondent. 

The singer shared an Instagram video showing a caterpillar cake, a sumptuous-looking white chocolate creation, a bottle of Taittinger champagne and Hypnotiq fruit liqueur to kick off her day of celebrations.
