Diane Kruger didn't miss an opportunity to showcase her stellar style while out and about in LA on Tuesday.

The German actress looked chic as can be wearing an all black ensemble during a stop by a Bristol Farms grocery store.

There, Diane, 44, put her slender stems on display donning a dark babydoll dress with long, puffed sleeved and a high neckline.

What a doll! Diane Kruger looked chic as ever while wearing a flirty black babydoll dress during a trip to the grocery store on Tuesday

While the frock was fairly conservative up top, the daring hemline gave people something to talk about.

Kruger, who shares a nearly two-year-old daughter with partner Norman Reedus, completed the leggy look with lace-up boots and a monochrome mask with stripes.

The Inglourious Basterds actress swept her golden tresses out of her face and into a low bun. Not needing much makeup, Diane had a natural glow to her skin.

After stocking up on supplies, Kruger made her way back to her family.

Diane and partner of four-years Norman welcomed a baby girl back in November of 2018.

But the very private couple have tried their hardest to keep their daughter out of the spotlight, not even sharing the tot's name with the public.

While the little girl is Kruger's first child, Reedus is already father to son Mingus Lucien, 20, from his prior relationship with Danish supermodel Helena Christensen. 

Diane, for her part, has been in past relationships with Dawson's Creek star Joshua Jackson, and was married to French actor Guillaume Canet from 2001 to 2006. 

The National Treasure star will next be seen on the big screen in 355, a spy thriller costarring Jessica Chastain, Sebastian Stan and Penélope Cruz.

As of now, it's expected January 15th, 2021.
