It's two weeks in and the first celebrity - Charles Oakley - has been sent home.

And the remaining 14 contestants were back hard at work on Thursday as Dancing With The Stars rehearsals continued in full swing.

Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause turned heads as she arrived at the dance studio in a sleeveless crop top and flowing skirt.

Chrishell, 39, and pro partner Gleb Savchenko have logged a total of 31 points out of a possible 60 so far in the ABC reality show.

In an interview with Good Morning America on Tuesday, Chrishell, who is going through a divorce from This Is Us actor Justin Hartley, described being on DWTS as 'one of the scariest things I've ever done.'

She added: 'I couldn't have imagined how immersive and all-encompassing this show was before. When you aren't dancing, you are thinking about dancing.'

The reality star hurt herself during rehearsals ahead of Tuesday's live show and only participated after being given the all-clear by medics.

Before Thursday evening's practice session, Kaitlyn, 35, had shared via social media that she was having a MRI on her ankle.

'Yesterday was kind of a write off for me because I was just in pain and kept my foot elevated and just did nothing all day yesterday,' she shared on Instagram.  

'I don't want to seem like a baby because I know so many people go through injuries on this show, and battle through, and that's what I want to do. But i just want to keep everyone posted,' she explained.
