Fashion fans are going wild over the release of ASOS t-shirts featuring the popular character 'Groovy Chick' from Bang On The Door. 

The online retailer has released an exclusive collection of t-shirts in collaboration with label Daisy Street. 

The designs both feature the Groovy Chick character from Bang On The Door, a brand founded 30 years ago that found popularity during the late nineties and early noughties thanks to its playful cast of characters.

A green Groovy Chick t-shirt priced at £19.99 has already sold out on the ASOS website.

The stylish piece was paired with denim jeans on the model who accessorised with a beaded necklace.

However, a white Daisy Street relaxed t-shirt with groovy chick back print for £21.99 is still available and the online retailer claims it's selling fast.

The crew neck design made from 100 per cent organic cotton, has a relaxed fit and is pictured worn with white jeans, low-top white trainers and a cream under shoulder handbag.

Gushing about the collection, one Twitter user wrote: 'I thought I'd never see her again... but here she is'

Another said: 'Wait, you can get Groovy Chick merch from ASOS??? I need it all immediately.'

Bang On The Door who debuted the original Groovy Chick collection, have continued to sell pieces including aprons, caps and hoodies on their website.
