A 'drunk' mother faces having her baby taken into care after she was filmed pushing her pram on to a skateboarding ramp before repeatedly falling over.

The woman, who was identified as Olga Zorikova, was recorded by teenagers at the skate park in Yefremov in Tula, Russia.

The 38-year-old tipped the pushchair over twice and on the second attempt the crying six-month-old girl somersaulted out.

Police have since launched a cruelty investigation into the incident and the local social care authorities have intervened to protect the child, according to reports. 

In the clip, the woman can be seen wearing a green mini skirt and a leather jacket as she races across the park.

She reaches the edge of a ramp before the wheels of the buggy appear to get wedged which sends the pram toppling forward.

The woman manages to turn sideways at the last minute to avoid putting all of her weight on top of her baby.

She picks up the little girl, who has started crying, but just seconds later she tries to run up the ramp with the baby in the pram once again.

This time the pushchair falls backward and the baby somersaults out as her mother slips to the ground. 

Russian police intervened after the video was released on social media.

Witnesses say the teenage skateboarders had called on adults to help and the 'drunk' woman fought with locals who tried to grab the baby to protect the child.

'It took two young men to stop her while another man took the baby. My nephew was there at the park,' said a local woman.  

The woman was earlier 'deprived of the right to raise her two elder children', twin boys, amid fears for their safety, according to reports.
