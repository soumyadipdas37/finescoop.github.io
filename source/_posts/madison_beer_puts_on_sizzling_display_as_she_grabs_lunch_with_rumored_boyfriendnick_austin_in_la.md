Madison Beer has had quite the month, recently dropping music from her debut album, before appearing on the MTV VMAs.

The Justin Bieber protégé is also focusing on her personal life, as she continues to fuel rumors of a new relationship.

She put on a sizzling display Monday in a country club chic look, as she stepped out for lunch with TikTok star Nick Austin, with whom she's been spending time lately.

The 21-year-old showed off her taut midriff and toned legs in a white sports bra and some skintight black bike shorts.

She draped a white sweatshirt over her shoulders for a preppy touch to her usual scantily-clad uniform.

Beer finished the ensemble with some thin '90s black sunglasses, a matching face mask, several pieces of gold jewelry and white sneakers with matching tube socks.

She carried a black Chanel crossbody bag over her shoulder, as she arrived at Toast Bakery Cafe in West Hollywood.

She and the Hype House member have been spotted together a couple times over the past week. 

The New York-born singer has recently been promoting her debut studio album Life Support, which is set to drop by end of summer. 

She recently told NME how mental health inspired the album: 'I was going through a really tough time when we were making this album. 

'I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I was in and out of dark mental states and in therapy three times a week.' 

Beer said of her team: 'They were just there to be a support system and that was another support system for me. I genuinely believe that the time I was creating my album and was genuinely suicidal, they were intertwined for a reason.'
