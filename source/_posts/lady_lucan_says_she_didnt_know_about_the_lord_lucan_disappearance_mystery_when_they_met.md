The mystery of what happened to John Bingham, the 7th Earl of Lucan, has gripped the British public for decades and made headlines around the world. 

But it appears the current Lady Lucan was not aware of the scandal surrounding her future family when she first met her now husband. 

George Bingham, the 8th Earl of Lucan, is the only son of John Bingham, who went missing in 1974 while he was the prime suspect in the murder of the Lucans' nanny, Sandra Rivett, who was found dead at the family's Belgravia home. 

Anne-Sofie Foghsgaard, Countess of Lucan, told Tatler she had 'absolutely no clue' about the history when she was introduced to her husband and added: 'I don't think people are that interested'.

'I think [the interest is] very much a generational thing, but also a very British thing,' she said. 'When I met George I had absolutely no clue about it, and also, frankly, I don't think people are that interested.' 

Lady Lucan is the founder of luxury clothing brand, Lucan. Dismissing any negative connotations, she argued it is 'a stunning name, and it's got a lot of history to it. It's British, full of heritage, colours and places. It's a luxury brand.' 

The current Lord Lucan was only seven years old when he last saw his father. 

Richard John Bingham, the 7th Earl of Lucan, disappeared after Ms Rivett was found dead in the Lucans' basement. 

29-year-old Sandra was — an inquest ruled in 1975 — most likely murdered by Lucan, who’d mistaken her for his estranged wife, Veronica, with whom he was locked in a bitter custody battle.  

Days later his borrowed car was found abandoned and blood-splattered at the cross-Channel port of Newhaven, East Sussex. One theory was that Lord Lucan had jumped into the sea and drowned.

In an ITV documentary in 2017, his wife, the late Lady Lucan said she believed Lord Lucan had jumped off a ferry shortly after the killing.

'I would say he got on the ferry and jumped off in the middle of the Channel in the way of the propellers so that his remains wouldn't be found,' she said. Lady Lucan was found dead in September 2017 at her home in Belgravia.  

Several other fantastical theories about his disappearance have placed him in the Australian outback, as a hippy drop-out in Goa, and even fed to the tigers at his friend John Aspinall's zoo. 

In January this year, Ms Rivett's son Neil Berriman, from West Sussex, claimed Lucan is alive and currently housebound, awaiting a major operation after decades living in Australia. The current Lord Lucan rubbished the claims at the time. 

Although a High Court judge granted a death certificate in 2016, paving the way for his son to inherit his title, this has provided neither resolution nor a conclusion to the mystery.

The Daily Mail from November 1974 as police hunt for Lucan's body at sea and his estranged wife Lady Lucan leaves a police station after saying he was guilty of the murder - and trying to kill her

 December 18 1934: Richard John Bingham is born in London into an aristocratic family with connections to Ireland.   

1955: He got a job with a small merchant bank, William Brandts, for £500 a year. 

1960: He retires having won £26,000 - around £600,000 in today's money - over two nights playing 'chemin de fer' at a gambling party run by John Aspinall.

1963 Marries Veronica Duncan - the couple have three children

1964 Becomes an earl after the death of his father, the 6th Earl of Lucan

1972 Their marriage collapses and Lucan moves out of the family home at 46 Lower Belgrave St, London. He loses a custody battle and accrues gambling losses

November 7 1974 The children's nanny Sandra Rivett is found dead. At 9.45pm, Lady Lucan, in great distress, burst into the Plumber’s Arms, the pub near her home in the exclusive area of Belgravia in central London. 

With blood streaming from several wounds on her head, she cried: ‘Help me, help me, help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’

Lady Lucan, who was estranged from her husband, told police her estranged husband had killed their nanny and tried to kill her. Police found the couple’s three children asleep in their beds, unharmed, and when they went to the basement they were greeted by a macabre scene.

The basement lightbulb had been removed, but in the semi-darkness, officers made out a pool of blood with a man’s footprint in it, a blood-stained length of lead piping and a mailbag containing a body.

November 14 1974: Lucan's car is found abandoned near Newhaven and police begin seraching for his body at sea after his speedboat was found scuppered.      

June 1975 Lucan is named as Ms Rivett's killer at the inquest into her death. 

1999 His family is granted probate over Lord Lucan's estate, but no death certificate is issued.

2016: A court issued a 'presumption of death' certificate for Lord Lucan, a ruling that cleared the way for the couple's son, George Bingham, to become the 8th Earl of Lucan.
