A police officer who once starred in a crime-fighting TV documentary has been unmasked as a paedophile who tried to groom children online.

PC Lee Tatton, 54, appeared on UKTV's fly-on-the-wall documentary Cops UK: Bodycam Squad as a response officer covering Hanley in 2016.

But the Staffordshire Police officer's career now lies in ruins after he admitted a number of child sex offences at Birmingham Crown Court this week.

At the time he was nicknamed Tatts and was filmed rescuing people from a flat fire and breaking up a pub brawl in Stoke by camera crews.

He was arrested in December last year while dealing with minor crime for the Northern Resolution Centre by his own force's Operation Safenet team.

The dedicated unit is tasked with looking into online child abuse to protect vulnerable young people from perverts and padeophiles.

Tatton was immediately suspended from duty by Staffordshire Police and remains on suspension subject to an internal force hearing.

At court, Tatton pleaded guilty to attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and four counts of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child. He will be sentenced on November 2 this year.

Production company Raw Cut spent several weeks in 2016 shadowing paedophile Tatton and his fellow officers on a range of incidents.

He was filmed rescuing people from a flat fire and breaking up a brawl a pub in Stoke - where he was accidentally pepper-sprayed by a colleague.

It was hoped that the crime-fighting programme - on UKTV's Really channel - would give the public an insight into the work of Staffordshire Police.

Speaking when the show premiered, Tatton said: 'It was put to our shift about the camera crews coming out with us and I was happy to volunteer. After a while it became second nature explaining to them what we were dealing with.

'I hope it will give people an insight into what we do and the things we have to deal with at 4am and 5am when most people are tucked up in bed.'

In a statement this week, Assistant Chief Constable Scott Green said: 'Tatton's actions are unacceptable and have caused harm and distress to the very people we should be protecting and keeping safe.

'His actions fell well below the high standards that the public and the force demands and expects of police officers.'
