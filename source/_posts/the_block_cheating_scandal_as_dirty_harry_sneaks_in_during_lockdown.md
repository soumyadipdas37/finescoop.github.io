The Block's Harry Pavlou was recently accused of sneaking into the building site when the contestants were supposed to be at home during the COVID-19 lockdown.

And the 57-year-old, who is competing on the show with his daughter Natasha, admitted on Monday to snooping around on set to 'take some measurements'.

While the interstate couples were back home, Harry was within walking distance of the construction site in Brighton - and his decision to discreetly work on his reno has sparked a cheating scandal.

'We live not too far from the site of The Block, and having that time to reflect, I decided to change what we were doing with the room upstairs, so I dropped by to take some measurements,' Harry explained to TV Week.

'I was only there for probably half an hour but I got sprung! The senior producer saw me. I tried to hide but it didn't work.'

Other contestants were 'disappointed' in Harry after they found out he'd visited the set, with SA couple Daniel and Jade Joyce taking it the hardest.

But Harry said he was not was aware that people were 'cranky about what I did'. 

'If anyone did have an issue they should have come and talked to me about it. But no one came and talked to me,' he said.

Following the scandal, he has now been nicknamed 'Dirty Harry' - but he has 'owned it' rather than being offended by the moniker.

Production on The Block was suspended in March before resuming with COVID-safety precautions in May. It was during this lockdown that Harry snuck on set.

On Sunday's episode, Harry and Natasha revealed their master ensuite to the judges, who gave them a 28-and-a-half score.

The father-daughter duo tied with Sarah and George, while Luke and Jasmin tied in first place with Jimmy and Tam on 29 points. 

Daniel and Jade finished third on 28 points.

The Block continues Monday at 7:30pm on Channel Nine
