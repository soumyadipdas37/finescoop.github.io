A former Myer model has been charged with trafficking narcotics after Indonesian police allegedly found marijuana in the bathroom of his Bali villa. 

London born Jed Texas, who has also graced the cover of Men's Health Magazine and partied with Kate Moss, was represented by Sydney agents Chic Management until Friday. 

Texas, who has a Melbourne-born girlfriend, is accused of having 85.15 grams of the drug hidden in plastic bags in his ensuite toilet, according to Newscorp.

Texas, who changed his name from Higgins, first appeared as a teenager in gay magazine 'Attitude' which led to him being signed by Elite Management. 

He completed a number of international assignments in the fashion capitals of Paris, Milan and New York. 

He also worked for Tom Ford and Burberry in their campaigns and appeared in Vogue and GQ magazines. 

The 30-year-old relocated to Australia in 2015 with Hannah Judd, 26, after they met when they both worked for Vivienne Westward in London.

The couple tried their hand at social media blogging with a page called Models Taste in which they reviewed restaurants. 

Bali police raided the model's beachside villa in April where they allegedly found the drugs, though a subsequent body search and urine test both turned up nothing. 

He has been in the island's notorious Kerobokan jail charged with possession and trafficking narcotics since his arrest.  

Indonesia's strict drug laws carry a maximum sentence of 12 years for possession and 20 years for trafficking while $1.6million in fines could also be imposed if Texas is found guilty.  

Police allege Texas admitted he bought the marijuana from an unknown man for $60 during coronavirus lockdowns on the island
