A taxi driver has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his 'amazing' mother-of-seven wife at their home in Leeds.

Abida Karim, 39, was found dead by police in a 'domestic-related' killing in West Yorkshire yesterday morning. 

Her husband Sajid Pervez, 37, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody for questioning.

It is understood that Ms Karim only returned home last week after burying her father in Pakistan.
