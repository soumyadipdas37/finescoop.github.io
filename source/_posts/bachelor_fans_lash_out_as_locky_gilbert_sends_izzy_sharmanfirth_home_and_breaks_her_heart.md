'Omg nooo, seeing Izzy cry broke my heart. She's soooo deserving of all things good, she literally such a light!' commented another. 

Before adding: 'Half of me is sad he chose the other catty, problematic girls over her but then the other part of me is glad she doesn't have to settle for Locky.'

Izzy was emotional as she hugged Locky goodbye before he walked her out.

Just before leaving, he told her: 'You're so amazing, you bring out the best in me. I've had literally the best time.'

Izzi replied: 'You've got some amazing girls back there. Good luck.'

In the car, Izzy tearfully told producers: 'I saw myself standing at the end of this whole experience with Locky. I was not expecting tonight to go the way it has. I guess it wasn't meant to be.

'Right now, I'm just feeling really heartbroken. But I wouldn't change anything,' she added.

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
