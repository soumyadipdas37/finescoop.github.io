Tammy Hembrow's hot new romance with Matt Poole is continuing to sizzle.

And on Thursday, the 26-year-old influencer shared a photo to Instagram of herself holding on to her boyfriend, 32, for dear life as they shared a passionate kiss.

The couple packed on the PDA outside his new restaurant, Maman Bar and Kitchen, in Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast.

In the snap, Tammy held Matt's face in her hands as they locked lips. 

She dressed for the evening in an animal print crop top with a matching midi skirt, which clung tightly to her curves.

Matt, who placed a hand on Tammy's famous derrière, opted for a laid-back look in a white button-up shirt and jeans.

The fitness mogul wrote in the caption: 'Proud of this human such beautiful first night at @maman_barkitchen congrats!!'

Matt, a former Ironman and surf lifesaver, replied: 'Thank you for everything.. dream team.'

The couple's affectionate display comes after Matt made his debut on Tammy's YouTube channel last week and answered a series of questions from her fans.

The genetically blessed couple revealed who was the 'most dominant' in their relationship, and also who'd been the first to say 'I love you'.

'I think you're the dominant one,' Matt said. 'I go along and I go along, and then when you push me too far, I snap, and you go, "Oh, too far."' 

'Yeah, I would agree,' Tammy responded. 'I just think I'm quite a dominant person.'

The pair, who met at an event in Bali last year, also revealed who'd said 'I love you' first.

'I did. I am obsessed,' Matt admitted, before Tammy explained how Matt had confessed his feelings after they'd 'had a little fight' on holiday in the Whitsundays earlier this month. 

'We had a little fight over nothing, and then when he was trying to make up with me and apologise, he told me he loved me,' the fitness mogul said with a smile.
