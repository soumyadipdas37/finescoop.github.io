Loose Women's Brenda Edwards has opened up about her abusive ex-partner in an emotional interview on today's show.  

The mother-of-two, 51, from Luton, who has children Jamal and Tanisha from a previous relationship, was left fearing for her life when she was punched in the face and threatened with a knife, two-years after she had escaped her abusive boyfriend. 

The X Factor star revealed she would 'blame herself' for her partner's violent and manipulative behaviour, but eventually left her boyfriend after he strangled her over a 'missing apple pie'.  

She told that at the start of their relationship, her partner was 'charming' and complimentary, but soon became controlling and aggressive.

'I met this guy who was charming and gorgeous and said all the right things, "You look lovely, I love what you have on",' told Brenda. 

'Then we started seeing each other and it was "Why are you wearing that? You look awful, that doesn't suit you, take it off. Then we were having a conversation and he punched the wall in my flat. He apologised and I let him off, it's like "Maybe I did something". 

'Then the second time, he punched the door and I had to tell people the ironing board had fell, I was papering up cracks to cover it.'  

As his behaviour became increasingly volatile, Brenda would begin to doubt herself more and more, asking what she'd done to deserve it - but eventually realised she had to escape after he violently attacked her over some food shopping. 

Brenda, pictured on the show last year, told that a the start of their relationship, her partner was 'charming' and complimentary, but soon became controlling and aggressive

She told: 'I found myself asking "What have I done to deserve this?" and I literally found myself talking to myself saying "What are you doing Brenda" and that is a sign you're not yourself. 

'There was an incident where I brought some apple pies and one of them was missing and he came home and freaked out and started strangling me. It was the strangling that made me say, "I have to get out of this".' 

But Brenda hadn't told her family and friends about the abuse, and feared her situation could worsen if she involved others. 

'I hadn't spoken to my family,' she said. 'And I thought if I spoke to my family they'd get involved and this could turn really ugly and I'll blame myself. 

Brenda and her best friend planned her escape, packing a bag for her and her two children while her friend waited at the flat to take her to safety. Pictured, Brenda with her Jamal and Tanisha as children

'I had both of the kids at this point, I phoned my best friend, I said what was going on and there was kind of, "You haven't said this before so it can't of been that bad", but it was the case of getting the strength to do that.'

'He turned up, I heard the keys in the door and felt the goose pimples,' said Brenda.  'There was bit of a tussle between me and my friend and him and we got out.' 

After hearing threats from her boyfriend, Brenda 'disappeared' for two years, and felt as though she was rebuilding her life - until her former partner showed up unannounced to her home.  

'I hadn't started seeing someone, but there was someone there, explained Brenda. 

'I said "Go upstairs", because I knew he was volatile.

Host Kaye adams asked Brenda: 'Did you fear for your life?', to which she replied: 'I was totally scared'

While Brenda has since had counseling, she explained that for around four years, she was forced to think 'four steps ahead'

'Then a massive argument came, he punched me in the face thinking something was going on when it wasn't. 

'Unbeknown to me my ex had knife and while he was threatening to do something with the knife, I text my girlfriend and she called the police, Before the police came he punched me in the face.'

She added: 'I spent a lot of time always thinking four steps ahead, thinking if I do this what will happen and if I do that what will happen, and that's what my life was for a couple of years, for three or four years.'
