Simeon Coxe, the legendary co-founder and singer of the 1960s experimental electronic band Silver Apples, has died at the age of 82.

Coxe died at his home in Alabama at 4am on Tuesday, September 8, after suffering with the progressive lung condition pulmonary fibrosis, a statement from his manager said.

The musician was famous for performing with primitive synthesizers of his own design, fusing traditional rock structures with melodies generated electronically.  

He founded the Silver Apples with drummer Danny Taylor in 1967. The band was active until 1970, before reforming in the mid-1990s. Taylor died in 2005.

They were among the first to incorporate electronic music techniques into 1960s rock and pop styles. 

Despite the band's short lifespan, they are credited with influencing the likes of Beck, Beastie Boys and Portishead.

His manager Jack Trevillion said that the pulmonary fibrosis had made it hard for him to breathe without oxygen, but that he died peacefully.

He added: 'Silver Apples leaves a lasting legacy and contribution to electronic music with their ground-breaking sound that has stood the test of time and influenced many artists over the years, right up to the present day.'

Prior to the founding of the Silver Apples, Coxe and Taylor played in a more typical 1960s rock band called the Overland Stage Electric Band.

But when Coxe was introduced to an oscillator - a very primitive forerunner of the synthesizer that had been built in the 1940s - he began experimenting with it over his band's music.

'They hated it,' he told The Guardian last year, and all the band members quit except for Taylor, and the pair formed the Silver Apples.

Coxe added more and more oscillators (or, as he put it, 'a home‑made pile of electric junk'), eventually building an instrument he called The Thing, and which the press called 'The Simeon'.

The Thing consisted of 'nine audio oscillators and 86 manual controls... The lead and rhythm oscillators are played with the hands, elbows and knees and the bass oscillators are played with the feet', according to the band's debut LP. 

As part of New York's underground music scene, they released two albums - 'Silver Apples' (1968) and 'Contact' (1969) - but did not see much commercial success.

Despite this, the band boasted many famous fans, including John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix, whom they jammed with before his legendary Woodstock Performance in 1969, according to the BBC.

A lawsuit was filed against the band and its record label Kapp in 1970 by Pan Am, owing to the similarity between the artwork of 'Contact' and the airline's logo. The lawsuit put an end to the band and record label.

For the photograph on the cover of 'Contact', Coxe and Taylor had actually received permission from Pan Am to sit in a cock pit of one of the airline's planes, but after the band added a picture of a plane crash on the reverse side, the record was pulled from the shelves and the Silver Apples had all their instruments confiscated. 

However, the band experienced a revival in the 1990s when German bootleg recordings of their albums surfaced and got them noticed.

Coxe reformed the group with other musicians, releasing new music, and in 1997 he played a show at New York's Knitting Factory, attended by Johnny Depp, Kate Moss, the Beastie Boys and Sean Lennon.

The Silver Apples were active in New York from 1967 to 1970, and reformed again in the mid-1990s. Coxe released his final album in 2016

In 1998 he reconnected with Taylor to complete their third LP - The Garden - in the same year, which had been stopped by the lawsuit in 1970. They went on to release three more albums after that.

But in 1998, tragedy struck when the band's tour bus was forced off the road while they were driving home from a Halloween show in New York.

In the crash, Coxe suffered from a broken neck, an injured spine, and partial paralysis. After 'years of physical therapy' - funded in part by a benefit concert organized by fans - the musician felt well enough to perform again.

However, by the time he had recovered, Taylor's health had also deteriorated, having been diagnosed with a degenerative muscle disease, and he died in 2005 of a heart attack. 

Coxe continued to release music, choosing to use samples of Taylor's drumming in live performances instead of using a session drummer.

Simeon Coxe was famous for using his own creation, which he called 'The Thing', when performing and making music. The Thing consisted of 'nine audio oscillators and 86 manual controls... The lead and rhythm oscillators are played with the hands, elbows and knees and the bass oscillators are played with the feet', according to the band's debut LP

His injuries still caused complications, however. 'I still stumble a lot just walking around,' he told Electronic Sound magazine in 2012. 'If I pick something up that's hot, it'll burn me before I realise I shouldn't be picking it up.

'But when it came to playing, I discovered it didn't matter that I couldn't feel with my hands. As long as I could see the dials on the oscillators, I could play them.'

He released his final album - Clinging to a Dream - in 2016, but said he never lost the desire to perform.

'Every day I wake up trying to figure out how to unravel something new,' he told Huck magazine. 

“Simeon is survived by his long-term companion and creative collaborator, Lydia Winn Levert; brother David Coxe (and wife Foster) and his nephew Aaron Coxe and family,' the statement released by his manager said. 'Rest in peace, Simeon,' it added.
