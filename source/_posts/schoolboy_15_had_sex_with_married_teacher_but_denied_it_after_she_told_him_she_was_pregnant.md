A schoolboy who claims he had sex with a married teacher said he told his headmaster nothing had gone on because she was pregnant and he did not want his child growing up in prison.

The teenager said he had three sexual encounters with 35-year-old Kandice Barber, who is alleged to have sent him a topless photo of herself that was passed around their Buckinghamshire school.

The jury at Aylesbury crown court was told today that Ms Barber said to the boy, who was 15 at the time, that she might be pregnant with his baby.

Giving evident over a video link today, the teenager, who is now 17, said: 'I didn't tell the school at first because she told me she was pregnant with my child.'

He agreed with Nadia Chabat, defending, that he had said he did not want his child growing up in prison.

Teacher Kandice Barber, 35, arrives at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire, where she is appearing accused of engaging in illegal sexual activity with a 15-year-old boy

The court has heard that an investigation began at the start of 2019 when the school obtained a topless picture of the teacher. 

She was to tell the police her Snapchat account must have been hacked.

Ms Chabat said Ms Barber had suffered a miscarriage before Christmas. 'By January you knew she was no longer pregnant.' He replied: 'I didn't know that.'

Asked why he had lied to the head teacher, he said: 'I didn't lie. I was just nervous. I probably just got my dates wrong.'

He agreed he told the Head that he had no photos of his teacher on his phone and that he had said nothing had gone on between them.

The teenager said Ms Barber had asked him to delete all their Snapchat messages. He agreed he had kept a screenshot of one topless image in case he needed it as evidence.

In his first interview with the police in March last year the teenager said he wore a condom as he had full sex on one occasion with the teacher in a field.

Ms Chabat asked him why he thought she might be pregnant. He replied: 'It could split. I know it couldn't be 100 percent. It is not guaranteed.'

The jury heard that the boy requested a second police interview. It took place in April when he told officers he had also performed a sexual act on Ms Barber in her car before she gave him oral sex on him in a nearby wood.

Asked why he had not told the police in the first interview when he was asked if anything else had gone on, he replied: 'I had never encountered the police before. I just got nervous.'

He admitted telling close friends she had given him oral sex.

In a third interview in June last year he said that after his 16th birthday, in October 2018, the teacher had performed oral sex on him again in the same woods.

Prosecutors alleged Barber (pictured outside Aylesbury Crown Court today) had picked up the youngster in her car and driven him to a secluded area where she had sex with him

Ms Barber of Wendover, Buckinghamshire denies: three counts of causing or inciting a child under 16 to engage in sexual activity, one of sexual communication with a child, causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activities while in a position of trust, causing a child to watch a sexual act by a person in a position of trust.

In a prepared statement she denied having sex with the boy. She said her pregnancy, when she lost the baby, was well known in the school and the father was her husband.

Yesterday, Aylesbury Crown Court was told Barber approached the boy at a school sports awards day and added him on Snapchat.

Prosecutors alleged the teacher, then 33, had then picked up the youngster in her car and driven him to a secluded area where she had sex with him.

Jurors heard how the teacher, who had school-age children of her own, had later met up with the boy for two other illicit trysts and sent him pictures of herself topless, which were then widely shared around the school.

Richard Milne, prosecuting, said: 'This case is about an adult teacher having sexual relations with a pupil at the school where she taught.

'It all started at a sports evening on September 27, 2018 when she came over to him and asked to borrow his phone. 

'She had possession of his phone, she put her details into his Snapchat account. Things developed on her part by her sending him messages. She would tell him she was having a bath or a shower and then ask him if he wanted to meet.

'She had driven over, he got into her car, she asked for somewhere private, he suggested some fields. It was 5pm in the evening on a school day.'

Explaining the position of trust charges, Mr Milne said: 'In this jurisdiction, England and Wales, teachers are not permitted to have sexual relations with pupils and it is not to do with the age of consent, it is because they are in a position of trust, be they male or female.

'The law does not permit, indeed criminalises, any sexual activity between a teacher and a child under the age of 18 years, even if they were consensual relations.'

The hearing continues.
