She's a devoted animal lover who adopted a vegan lifestyle back in 2018.

So it makes perfect sense that Ellen Pompeo would go an afternoon walk with a friend while carrying one of her four pet pooches in a shoulder pouch in the trendy Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles on Monday.

At times, the little grey puppy's head and tail could be seen peaking through the top of the black pet carrier that was slung over her left shoulder.

For the walk, the Grey's Anatomy star, 50, went makeup free and dressed down in black leggings and a baggy white t-shirt. 

She also donned grey sneakers and pulled her long blonde tresses back into a ponytail.  

With the sun glaring down on another warm summer day, she also kept a pair of dark sunglasses handy on the top of her head.

On more than a few occasions, the actress directed her attention to her little dog that appeared to be more than happy to be relaxing in the carrier.

Pompeo's friend also opted for sporty comfort in the fashion department in black leggings, a black tank top and sneakers.

The Massachusetts native raises three children, Stella Luna, 10, Sienna May, six, and Eli Christopher, three, with music producer husband of ten years Chris Ivery, 53.  

The couple decided to adopt a vegan diet two years ago after Pompeo had a routine checkup with her doctor.

It turns out her physician touted her book -- "Breasts: The Owner's Manual -- that recommends a plant-based diet as a means to decrease the risk of female-specific cancers such as breast and ovarian cancers.

['Dr. Funk] told me she turned her three kids completely vegan and I came home from my appointment with her where she basically gave me [the information] … and I said, "'That’s it, we're all vegan,"' Pompeo told People.

Pompeo has played the role of Dr. Meredith Grey on Grey's Anatomy for all 16 seasons of the medical drama series.

The 17th Season of Grey's Anatomy has not yet started production, due to COVID-19, and there is no indication as to when filming may start.
