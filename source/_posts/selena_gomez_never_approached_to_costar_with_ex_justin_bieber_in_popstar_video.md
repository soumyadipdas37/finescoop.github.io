Selena Gomez never got a request to co-star with her ex Justin Bieber in the Popstar music video, contrary to a recent claim.

Justin was a major presence in the video for Drake and DJ Khaled's song, even miming a lyric about Selena.

However an insider in Selena's camp told People the 28-year-old songbird 'was never approached and had no plans to participate in the music video.'

This source's statement flies in the face of Imperium Group CEO Shazir Mucklai who claimed to Globe Newswire to have urged Selena to feature in the video.

Selena's latest People source has also denied Shazir's allegation that he has a role in her Rare Beauty brand with Sephora.

Meanwhile Justin fired up his Instagram page this Saturday to treat his fans to some behind-the-scenes photos from the music video.

In one smoldering snap he could be seen posing shirtless with a slew of his music video co-stars in brightly colored clothing.

Another picture showed him flopped facedown on a bed with DJ Khaled's catchphrase 'ANOTHER ONE' splashed across the wall.

Justin also posted a picture of himself in a long bright blue coat while posing up alongside his creative director Nick DeMoura.

Internet personality Andrew 'King Bach' Bachelor could also be seen lounging on a sofa with Justin while shooting the music video.

Drake and DJ Khaled took a step back in the music video for Popstar, instead letting pal Justin take center stage.

While Biebs lived the high life in the video, seen sipping champagne while covered in diamonds and surrounded by girls, there was one more moment that stood out for fans.

Justin's seen lip-syncing a Drake lyric mentioning the 26-year-old's ex girlfriend Selena Gomez.

'Look, Ariana, Selena, my Visa,' the Canadian crooner mimes as he and a posse walk through a party at his mansion.

There are several other sly references to the Baby singer in the song, which also mentions his longtime manager Scooter Braun, who also sneaks in a cameo.

Drake also pokes fun at Justin's pretty boy image, later rhyming: 'S**t don’t even usually get this big without a Bieber face.' 

The video opens with DJ Khaled self recording dozens of videos with ideas for the Popstar music video and sending them to Drake.

'We have to shoot the Popstar video,' the producer says. 'I know the boarders closed, they won't let me in the country, what do you want me to do? The song is too big. We have to shoot the video. We have to figure something out.' 

The videos of Khaled overlap into an almost indistinguishable mix of his ideas. 

'Khaled man, this guy's off his rocker,' Drake says exasperated opening the videos. 'I don't know what to say...It's like you someone everything that you have and they're like "anotha one. (sic)"'

Wild night: The song starts rolling over film of people passed out in the hallways of a mansion, leading to Justin waking up in bed as he sings to the song 

 Called in a favor: It seems Drake 'called in a favor' to get Justin to star in the video

'I can't do a video,' Drake says. 'I can't even leave the country and this guy wants me to do a video for him. There's one thing I can do for sure but I'm gonna have to call in a favor though.' 

The song starts rolling over film of people passed out in the hallways of a mansion, leading to Justin waking up in bed as he sings to the song. 

Justin walks down the hallways followed by a large security guard, with a bottle of champagne in his hand and diamond chains on his neck. 

He gets downstairs to the party still going on and he quickly makes himself comfortable in between two young ladies.

Cameo: As Drake raps 'I'm a popstar, but this s**t ain't bubblegum, yeah / You would probably think my manager is Scooter Braun,' the manager makes his perfectly times entrance

Justin heads upstairs to find people dancing, as he has a stylist undress and dress him quickly. 

He then heads to a studio with a red backdrop as the lyrics continue 'Crown in my hand and I'm really playin' keep-away / S**t don't even usually get this big without a Bieber face.' 

The Baby singer continues to enjoy the house party, dancing in the driveway with friends and sitting poolside in a large blue fur coat.

Just a dream: As the song ends, Justin is once again waking up but this time he is not in a house filled with people but in bed next to his wife Hailey Bieber, telling her about the party-filled dream

As the song ends, Justin is once again waking up but this time he is not in a house filled with people but in bed next to his wife Hailey Bieber. 

'You okay?' the 23-year-old model asks. 'I had a crazy dream. Drake asked me to be in a video, but he wasn't in the video it was just a bunch of people,' Justin says shaking his head. 

He turns to his wife and says 'I love you,' before suggesting they take their dog out for a walk. 

While out on their walk, Justin pauses as his phone rings and 'DRAKE' appears on the screen.
