Barack Obama's long-awaited and much-anticipated memoir will be published on November 17 - two weeks after this year's presidential election.

His reflections on his life and his presidency will come in two parts.

'A Promised Land' is volume one and will trace his life from his childhood through his first term in the White House, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden, his publisher Penguin Random House announced on Thursday.

The book clocks in at 768 pages and will include two 16-page photographic inserts. It will sell for $45.

The timing of the releases means the former president will be on tour promoting his book after voters decide whether or not to give President Donald Trump a second term in the White House.

'There's no feeling like finishing a book, and I'm proud of this one. I've spent the last few years reflecting on my presidency, and in 'A Promised Land' I've tried to provide an honest accounting of my presidential campaign and my time in office,' Obama said in a statement.

'Along with being a fun and informative read, I hope more than anything that the book inspires young people across the country - and around the globe - to take up the baton, lift up their voices, and play their part in remaking the world for the better,' he noted.

The first volume will be released in 25 languages and the publisher plans to print 3 million copies.  

A publication date for the second volume has not yet been set and will be announced at a later date. 

The first volume of the book will cover his early political activism through the 2008 presidential campaign, where he defeated Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and then beat John McCain in the general election to become the nation's first African American president.

It will also details how Obama dealt with the global financial crisis, handled Vladimir Putin, passed the Affordable Care Act, and Operation Neptune's Spear, which led to the death of bin Laden, according to the publisher.

But the book will also contain personal moments, including his times of 'self-doubt and disappointment.' 

Obama will also discuss how living in the White House affected his family: wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia. 

Michelle Obama's memoir 'Becoming' was published to great acclaim in 2018.

It sold more copies than any other book published in the United States that year, breaking the record in just 15 days.

And, as of March 2019, had sold more than 10 million copies.

The Obamas signed a two-book deal with Penguin Random House in 2017 and were reportedly paid $65 million.

The former president has authored two other books: 'Dreams From My Father,' published in 1995, has sold more than 3.3 million copies in the United States and Canada and 'The Audacity of Hope,' which was published in 2006, has sold more than 4.2 million.
