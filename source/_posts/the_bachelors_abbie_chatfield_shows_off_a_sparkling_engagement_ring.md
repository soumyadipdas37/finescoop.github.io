Abbie Chatfield set the Internet alight on Friday night when she showed off a sparkling engagement ring.

But the former Bachelor star is not yet a bride-to-be, having just tried on her friend's prized bling while at dinner.

In a short clip shared to Instagram Stories, the 25-year-old joked how she 'felt a little bit sick' with the diamond on that finger.

Tagging her friend in the post, Abbie was heard saying: 'Forcing me [to] put it on! Put it on! It makes me feel a little bit sick. Me? So single.'

She also revealed that when she does get engaged, she has a particular ring in mind.

'Whoever marries me, I want a gold one, thank you,' Abbie penned online.  

False alarm: But Abbie is not yet a bride-to-be, having just tried on her friend's prized bling while at dinner. She joked about how she felt 'sick' and 'uncomfy' with the ring on that finger 

Reality TV debut: Abbie starred on Matt Agnew's season of The Bachelor last year, where she placed runner-up behind Chelsie McLeod. Pictured with Matt 

Abbie starred on Matt Agnew's season of The Bachelor last year, where she placed runner-up behind Chelsie McLeod.

The influencer went on to star in this year's season of spin-off Bachelor in Paradise, but did not find a lasting connection. 

Abbie told Daily Mail Australia this month that she's glad she was paired with the astrophysicist, and not this year's suitor, Locky Gilbert.

'I'm glad Locky wasn't my Bachelor because the thought of doing outdoorsy stuff makes me want to die!' she joked. 

She said Locky was 'fine' as a Bachelor, but admitted that his adventurousness wasn't exactly suited to her personality.

'I'm glad that I had a little science nerd,' she said. 'I'm glad that I had Matt.' 

Not as adventurous: 'I'm glad Locky wasn't my Bachelor because the thought of doing outdoorsy stuff makes me want to die!' Abbie joked
