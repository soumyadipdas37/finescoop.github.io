Global leader in luxury bridal Pronovias Group has always been more than a wedding dress destination.

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the benevolent brand donated wedding dresses to hospital-employed brides-to-be working on the frontlines.

And now, the company has established a clear scheme of helping the environment with its #WeDoEco initiative, its first sustainable bridal collection.

The company-wide initiative that includes all Pronovias Group brands (Pronovias, St Patrick, White One, Nicole, and Lady Bird) is part of a bigger plan for the next five years to set new bridal industry standards for a sustainable future.  

The #WeDoEco initiative is comprised of thirty-nine size-inclusive dresses (0 to 34) ranging from 360º Eco (all around sustainable) to Ecofriendly (made of sustainable materials). 

To satisfy every bride's needs, the dresses in the collection demonstrate varying degrees of sustainable factors, including, where the dresses are produced, what they are made of, and how they are packaged. 

Fifteen dresses are 360º Eco which means they are made in Spain or Italy only, are composed completely with certified eco-profiles, and delivered in eco-packaging.

'We are passionate about the environment and passionate about making our brides’ dress dream come true. 

'Today millennials and Gen-Z consumers are more discerning than ever, they don’t want to compromise between a stylish fit and a sustainably sourced dress.'
