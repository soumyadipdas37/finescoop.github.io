They're one of the great success stories to come from Married At First Sight. 

And ahead of welcoming their first child together, Jules Robinson and Cameron Merchant have snapped up a $1.8million property on Sydney's Northern Beaches.

The reality star couple wasted no time moving into their new property, after Cameron sold his one-bedroom boutique apartment in Kirribilli for $900,000.

The contemporary home features four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a large outdoor entertaining area for their baby to play in.

The main bedroom features a built-in robe and ensuite.

The property is mere minutes away from Cameron's parents, Margaret and Russell, and a short drive to Dee Why Beach.

Cameron and Jules have been racing against time to finish renovating their new property before welcoming their new addition.

To get the job done, the reality TV couple have called in renovation experts, couple Mitch Edwards and Mark McKie, from The Block.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia last week, soon-to-be-father Cam said the couple have already picked out a name for the baby, if their bundle of joy should be a girl.

He said they decided during filming their season of MAFS in 2018. 

 'I mentioned it to Jules when we first brought up kids, and she loved it and we have gone with it.'   

Cameron and Jules, who legally married in November 2019, have chosen to keep the sex of their unborn child a secret until birth.
