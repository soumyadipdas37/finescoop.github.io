Virgin Atlantic has confirmed it could axe a further 1,150 jobs from across the company taking the total number of job losses to 4,700 during the coronavirus crisis.

The company has said they are 'working closely with unions Unite and BALPA' and that a company-wide consultation period of 45 days begins today.

It comes less than four months after axing 3,150 roles and announcing the closure of its base at London's Gatwick Airport. 

The company confirmed a further 400 employees left through voluntary redundancy or early retirement.

The announcement has been made just days after securing a £1.2billion rescue deal.

In a statement, the firm said: 'The last six months have been the most challenging in Virgin Atlantic’s history.

'Even in the toughest times, the people of Virgin Atlantic are what sets it apart and they have made tremendous sacrifices.

'Unfortunately, despite actions already taken to reshape and resize the business, regrettably the airline must go further one last time with changes at scale, to ensure it emerges from this crisis.'

It added that to mitigate as many cabin crew redundancies as possible, additionally, the airline is introducing a voluntary, Company-led and financed furlough scheme for an additional 600 crew when HM Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ends at the end of October.

Should the Government extend its Scheme, the airline intends to continue to benefit from it. 

The airline is calling on the UK and US governments to introduce testing regimes to help ease the restrictions on transatlantic travel.

The statement said: 'As the airline increases passenger operations, the opening of US borders and removal of quarantine is imperative to recovery.

'These travel restrictions impact on Virgin Atlantic disproportionately given its long-haul operations focussed on the transatlantic.

'The airline is calling for both UK and US governments to introduce robust passenger testing regimes to lift travel restrictions whilst protecting public health.'

It comes as it was revealed there are at least 30 countries which offer or accept coronavirus tests at airports.

Many have introduced systems where a negative test will either end the need to quarantine or reduce its length.

Some carry out testing on arrivals at the airport. Others also accept recent tests carried out before departure.

 Countries where testing before flying or on arrival can reduce quarantine times include Germany, France and Austria
