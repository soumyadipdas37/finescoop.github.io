'Cult' mom Lori Vallow has pleaded not guilty to charges related to the deaths of her children. 

Lori, 47, entered her plea on Thursday morning in Madison County Court via a Zoom call from jail. 

This month marked the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of Lori's children, Joshua 'JJ' Vallow and Tylee Ryan, whose bodies were found buried on her husband Chad Daybell's property in June.  

Investigators believe the children, who were never reported missing by their mother, were murdered within hours of when they vanished within two weeks of each other in September 2019.  

Both Lori and Chad are now facing two felony counts for conspiring to conceal or destroy evidence in the case.

Lori is facing three additional misdemeanor counts of resisting or obstructing officers, solicitation to commit a crime and contempt of court from her arrest back in February.  

Chad has already pleaded not guilty to both the conspiracy charges and two other counts for destruction or concealment of evidence.

Both defendants are set to face trial in January 2021. 

Madison County Special Prosecutor Rob Wood and the state of Idaho asked a judge to join the cases against Lori and Chad last week - just after Chad's attorney asked to have the case against him thrown out altogether. 

Neither Chad nor Lori have been accused of harming Tylee and JJ. Authorities have yet to say how the children died, or whether homicide charges will be filed in the future.

Tylee vanished on September 8, 2019, just days before her 17th birthday. Investigators said her body was burned and dismembered before being buried sometime the following day. 

JJ was last seen two weeks later on September 23. His body was wrapped in duct tape and plastic and buried the same day, investigators said. 

Authorities believe Lori's now-deceased brother Alex Cox brought the children's bodies to Chad's home to bury them. 

The search for JJ and Tylee began back in November 2019 when police officers performed a welfare check at Lori's home in Rexburg and found that neither of the children had been heard from since two months earlier.  

The case captured nationwide attention with the revelations that police were also investigating at least three suspicious deaths linked to Lori and Chad, as well as relatives' claims that the couple are members of a dangerous doomsday cult.

Lori and Chad went on the run the day after police began searching for the children and reopened an investigation into the death of Chad's first wife Tammy Daybell, who died on October 19, 2019.  

Police tracked the couple down in Hawaii in January and Lori was later arrested on charges of child abandonment and desertion. 

The search came to a devastating end in June as JJ and Tylee's remains were discovered in Chad's backyard in Salem, Idaho. 

This is a developing story.
