Kerri-Anne Kennerley

TV veteran Kerri-Anne Kennerley is among the biggest names to be axed amid Channel 10's cost-cutting measures.

The beloved presenter acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to tighten the budget, and thanked her friends and colleagues for their support.

'I just know I'm back on the 'lazy Susan' of television. Yeah, it's very, very tough for a lot of people,' she said on Studio 10.  

The media veteran also graciously said that she accepts losing her job if it means she is saving the livelihoods of her colleagues.

'Let's face it. We've got to get down to logic here. It is what it is. It's not the first time, unfortunately. Companies do these sort of cuts to make the business better, which in the long run saves a lot more jobs,' she said.

Natarsha acknowledged that 2020 has been a 'challenging year for many' and has 'in many way reminded us about what truly matters in life.' 

'I'm sad to leave, but excited about the new chapter ahead. I can't wait to share with you what's coming up!' she concluded.

'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.

'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role. We talked about it openly and warmly about what that might look like.'  

On his own terms: Speaking of his bosses' reaction to take matters into his own hands and leave Studio 10, Joe added: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them

'I was caught off guard. I'll be honest... I was totally surprised when I got the phone call. I just had no idea', he told The Daily Telegraph. 

'You don't want to hear the news you are no longer in their plan going forward. But, well, I've taken that in my stride,' he said.   

He added: 'I've had a good 25 years and I've been lucky to have survived that long. There have been retrenches and I've survived those, but not quite this time.'
