Australian rock legend Jimmy Barnes is no one-trick pony.

Just weeks ahead of releasing his new book, The 64-year-old has now announced the launch of his latest creative pursuit - a podcast. 

Titled Story Time with Jimmy Barnes, the six-part podcast series will feature interviews with some of the singer's most intriguing celebrity friends, including MasterChef Australia judge Jock Zonfrillo.

'I've done a few things on radio, I hosted a show on Triple M, but the podcast thing is a great idea because we've all become used to connecting with each other on these different platforms during the whole COVID lockdown thing,' Jimmy told The Daily Telegraph on Sunday.    

Other celebrities who will appear on the podcast include The Living End frontman Chris Cheney, golfer Peter Lonard, author Debra Oswald and production manager 'Sneaky' Pete McFee. 

Jimmy's beloved wife Jane and daughter Mahalia will also appear on the podcast.

Fun project: 'I like the idea of doing this because the interactions with my mates, whether they're musicians or chefs or writers, is a lot of fun,' he told The Daily Telegraph

Sydney-based Jimmy came up with the idea to launch a podcast while in lockdown at home amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Self-isolation proved a very creative time for the Scottish-born songwriter, who used the time to complete his third memoir, Killing Time: Short stories from the long road home.

He also spent time in lockdown learning how to play the bagpipes, and even entertained fans with nightly concerts.   

'I'm loving spending quiet time at home. I get the time to do some of the things that I always said I would do but could never find the time,' he told The Daily Telegraph in April.  

Story Time with Jimmy Barnes will be launched on October 7, and will coincide with the release of Killing Time: Short stories from the long road home.
