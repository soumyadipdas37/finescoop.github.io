Farmer Wants A Wife star Jess Wolfe was brutally dumped by hunky farmer Alex Taylor for runner-up Henrietta Moore in a huge plot twist on the reality dating series last month. 

And bubbly blonde Jess has well and truly proved she's still not over it, as she took a rather a vicious swipe at Alex on Tuesday. 

Taking to Instagram, she shared a clip from the show, in which she is seen waving her arms at the handsome Cunnamulla sheep and beef farmer, along with the caption: 'Remember me?' 

'Sorry Alex, you have had your turn!' Farmer Wants A Wife's Jess Wolfe took a vicious swipe at former beau Alex Taylor after being brutally dumped for runner-up Henrietta Moore 

According to a report in New Idea magazine, the newly-single blonde initially captioned the photograph: 'Sorry Alex, you have had your turn!' 

She later changed it to just: 'Sorry Alex' while tagging him in the post.  

Alex dumped Jess for Henrietta during last month's Farmer Wants A Wife finale and the pair are still together.

'Fantastic to finally meet the Moore clan,' he wrote, appearing with Henrietta's sister Penelope and presumably her mother.

'With my two favourite farmers this morning in rainy Currumbin,' the 31-year-old teacher captioned the snap.  

In what was arguably the show's biggest twists, Alex revealed he started to see Jess, 25, as just a friend after initially choosing her over Henrietta. 

'I just kept on starting to feel that I could only see her as my friend. I couldn't see this romance blossoming that I was craving,' he explained in the show's finale, adding, 'My heart wasn't in it.'

Alex said he ultimately broke up with Jess before teasing he still managed to find love after his stint on the show.

Henrietta then came walking down the staircase, leaving the show's other farmers and their partners visibly surprised.

'Things ended with Jess and I, and there were all of these questions still floating around,' explained Alex.  

'I just kept on starting to feel that I could only see her as my friend. I couldn't see this romance blossoming that I was craving,' he explained of Jess (pictured), despite choosing her on the show

'I contacted Henrietta and we started talking again, and it just felt right. I still feel connected to her. 

'Chemistry is a hard thing to find, and that spark. You don't find it with very many people.' 

Henrietta said they never planned on getting together again romantically, agreeing to meet up 'as friends'.  

But she admitted it wasn't long before sparks started to fly again, and Alex said a romance between them 'felt natural'.

'We are quite different people on some level, but soulmates,' said Henrietta, before giving Alex a passionate kiss.

Added Alex: 'I feel happy and I feel confident again, and I haven't felt like that for a long time... I feel alive again.' 

'I contacted Henrietta and we started talking again, and it just felt right. I still feel connected to her': Alex and Henrietta are still together
