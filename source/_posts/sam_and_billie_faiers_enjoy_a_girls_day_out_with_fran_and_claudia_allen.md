Sam and Billie Faiers proved they won't be letting the new government rules stop them from having a good time as they headed out with Francesca and Claudia Allen.

The Mummy Diaries stars appeared in jubilant spirits as they enjoyed a belated birthday celebration for Claudia at Cecconi's in Mayfair, London, on Thursday.

Sam, 29, shared a video of the women, who were joined by another pal, strutting down the street as she declared: 'Start early, finish early', in accordance with the new 10pm curfew enforced to all bars and restaurants in England.

Sam styled her dark blonde locks in a bouncy blown out style and accentuated her pretty features with soft touches of make-up.

Meanwhile, Billie, 30, looked equally fashionable in a purple jumpsuit, which was tied around her midriff and enhanced her svelte figure.
