She's been keeping busy in recent weeks by shooting scenes for her new ITV reality show Meets Her Match with her fiancé Bradley Dack. 

But Olivia Attwood took a brief break from filming as she headed to Sainsbury's to do the weekly shop in Manchester on Thursday.

The TOWIE star, 29, dressed down for the casual outing as she loaded her car with groceries, before heading to a charity shop to donate two bags filled with items.

Cutting a low-key figure, the former Love Islander was dressed in a clingy, long-sleeved top, a plaid shirt worn around her waist and distressed jeans.

The media personality nailed sporty chic when it came to her footwear choice as she strolled across the car park in box-fresh trainers by Nike.

With her tresses worn in Dutch braids, the glamour model complemented her beauty with matte make-up and accessorised with large hooped earrings and a designer crossbody bag.

The former grid girl recently announced her new reality TV show will air on ITVBe this autumn.

The eight-episode series will follow Olivia and the Blackburn Rovers footballer as they plan for their wedding and buy their first home in Cheshire.

The couple got engaged in Dubai in October last year following a four-year on/off romance.

Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.

However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore.

He said to her at the time: 'I love you, I always will. You know that, nothing doubts that. You can't kid yourself.'

Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson.
