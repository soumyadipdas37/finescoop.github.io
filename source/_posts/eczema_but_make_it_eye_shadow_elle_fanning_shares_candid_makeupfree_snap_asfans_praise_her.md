Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflammation.  

The All the Bright Places star's 4.8 million followers were quick to praise the actress for her candid photos and lauded her for showing 'real normal skin' on social media.

One person said: 'Thank you for not using like a dozen filters, its so nice seeing real normal skin texture on this app and it makes me feel good about myself.'

Another follower commented: 'Thank you for posting this Elle you have no idea. I have struggled with my eczema on my hands and for over a decade now and as of more recently have had it on my face and twice on my eyelids. 

'Thank you for being vulnerable and posting this and making people like us feel a little better, bc I really do feel seen and not as ashamed to talk about it / share.'

Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked.

Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. However, it may also develop for the first time in adults.

Eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body.

Eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin that leads to redness, blistering, oozing, scaling and thickening. 

Eczema's cause is not fully understood but it can flare up with stress, changing weather, allergies, illness or dry skin.

Patients should avoid known triggers for flare ups and use emollients.   

Elle and her sister Dakota Fanning are starring in an upcoming movie called The Nightingale in which they will play estranged sisters navigating the dangers of life in Vichy, France, during World War II. 

Although it was originally slated for release this year the coronavirus pandemic has caused it to be bumped to December 2021.

The director is French film star Melanie Laurent, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie Inglourious Basterds. 

This is also not the first time Elle has worked with her sister - she made her film debut as a younger version of Dakota's character in the 2001 drama I Am Sam. 

She can also be seen in a string of extravagant ensembles on her new darkly comic Hulu show The Great which she leads as Russian Empress Catherine II.

The series was created by Tony McNamara, co-writer of the similarly acid-tongued historical comedy The Favourite, who thought of Elle in the part.
