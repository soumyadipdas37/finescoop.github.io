Jill Duggar enjoyed a piña colada while out for a date night with her husband Derick Dillard this weekend — making her the first Duggar to confirm that she drinks alcohol.

On Saturday, the 29-year-old went out for dinner with Derick at a Mexican restaurant in Arkansas and shared a picture showing a tasty-looking frozen drink in front of her.

When commenters asked what she was sipping, she told them it was a piña colada — and further confirmed that it was a 'regular' one, not a virgin one made without alcohol.

Good for her! She confirmed that it was a 'regular' alcoholic version of the drink in the comments

'Date night with my favorite person @derickdillard,' Jill wrote, captioning a photo of herself and Derick sitting side-by-side.  

'We’ve missed our regular date night outings during covid and have had lots of in home dates, but we were able to swap childcare with friends last night for a date!'

In the comments section, she responded to inquisitive fans asking about her drink choice, confirming that she was, in fact, having an alcoholic beverage. 

Even a single cocktail is a major departure from Jill's upbringing in a strict evangelical Christian family, where she and her siblings were raised to stay away from alcohol. 

For some fundamentalist Christians, even wine is off-limits — and they believe that references to wine in the Bible actually mean grape juice.

There has been some speculation that Jill has opened up to the occasional cocktail, but this is the first time that she has explicitly said so. 

Go, girl! In July, Jill and Derick visited a whiskey and cigar lounge owned by her cousin Amy's husband Dillon King

Snark? Amy, 33, said their new favorite word was 'freedom' on Instagram — and Jill's husband Derick Dillard thanked them for 'good food, drinks, and company'

In July, the mother-of-two was pictured out at Wellington's, a whiskey and cigar lounge in Springdale, Arkansas owned by her cousin Amy's husband Dillon King.

Jill wasn't actually photographed partaking in either vice, but Derick Dillard did thank the other couple for treating them to 'good food, drinks, and company.' 

Amy shared a photo of them together on Instagram after the visit, taking a dig at Jill's parents and her restrictive upbringing in the caption.

'Our new favorite word: Freedom!' she wrote.

While Jill didn't comment on the snarky caption, Derick did chime in, writing: 'Thanks for treating us! We had a great time! Good food, drinks, and company (not necessarily in that order.)

Though the picture didn't show Jill or Derick actually drinking — or smoking cigars for that matter — Jill did post some snaps of the cheese and charcuterie plate they enjoyed — which seemed to be a perfect pairing for a glass of wine.

Yum! Though Jill wasn't pictured with alcohol at the time, she did share a photo of a tasty cheese and charcuterie plate

No big deal! Her 'rebel' cousin Amy has no problem with alcohol, and seems to be supporting Jill while her relationship with the rest of her family is strained 

Jill, however, has been stepping away from a lot of her parents' stricter teachings — and her husband has hinted before that they may not mind a drink here or there. 

In 2018, when a Twitter user asked Derick why they didn't drink wine, he seemed to deny it.

'Where did you read that?' he said. 'I don’t think we’ve ever said that.'

Jill has 'rebelled' against her parents' rules and teachings countless other ways, too, wearing pants and even shorts, cutting her once-long hair, taking relatively openly about sex (within the confines of marriage, of course), piercing her nose, and — some fans speculate — using birth control (the couple has not confirmed this; though Derick did say that his own parents used birth control). 

This summer, she shared a sponsored Instagram post for a modest swimwear company, modeling several of their outfits.

Big boy time: Jill Duggar's oldest son Israel started kindergarten two weeks ago

Off they go! The whole family went with Israel to drop him off at the school - and all four of them donned face masks per the school's new regulations 

And on August 24, she dropped her oldest son, Israel, off at his first day of kindergarten in public school after she and her siblings had all been homeschooled. 

The proud mom seemed thrilled to be sending her five-year-old off on an adventure she herself never got to have. 

Unfortunately, some of this — and the couple's refusal to film for the family's TLC reality show anymore — has led to strained relationships with Jill's parents.

Derick has claimed on numerous occasions that Jill's father, Jim Bob, restricts her visits to their home — and that Jill has to ask permission to come over, especially if Jim Bob isn't there.

Jill even reportedly had to get permission from Jim Bob to go do her sister Jessa's house when she gave birth to daughter Ivy last year. 

Down with the tyrant! Meanwhile, Derick has been calling out Jill's dad Jim Bob for restricting their access to the rest of the family 

Enabler: Jim Bob reportedly restricts Jill's access to the family home, and she is unwelcome at some family gatherings — but Jill's abuser, sex pest Josh, is inexplicably welcome

Derick has had some truly scathing words for his father-in-law, who doesn't seem to place similar restrictions on older son Josh, who admitted molesting four of his younger sisters, including Jill, as well as a fourth child when he was a teenager. 

In July, he even went so far as to compare Jim Bob, 55, to Jeffrey Epstein, accusing him of placing a higher importance on money than following Jesus.

'[Counting On is] is still under his control. And he will attack the victims if they threaten his show.

'We were humiliated and threatened when we first tried to not film,' he added. 

'We have to break this culture, that cares more about money and ratings than protecting the most vulnerable. 

'Jeff Epstein already showed us that if you have enough money, power, and influence, you can get away with anything. Sadly, it doesn’t stop with him. There are many more stories in this world that are not too different, existing in a culture where it can still thrive.'
