Elizabeth Sobinoff has added to her ever-growing tattoo collection.

On Saturday, the former Married At First Sight star showed off her latest ink to fans on Instagram.

Sharing a photo at a Sydney tattoo parlour, Elizabeth, 28, revealed she has added a large design to her inked physique.

The brunette beauty proudly showed off her new tattoo, which was placed on her left thigh.

The design, which was placed alongside two previously-inked wolves, included a forest, mountain and moon inside a circle. 

'Inked up again! Thank you Gillian for my new contribution to my collage,' she wrote.

'If you didn't know me you'd think I was cleaned skin,' she added.

Her boyfriend Seb Guilhaus commented underneath her post, writing: 'Insert wolf howl.'

This comes months after the reality TV star revealed a huge new inking underneath her bust, as well as one on her back. 

Pulling up her black top, the brunette proudly showed off a bee and flower design across her torso, followed by a kookaburra on one side of her back.

In June 2019, she also got a comprehensive new inking, spanning from her back, down the side of her body, and to her thigh.

The sprawling design incorporating various animals was inspired by the children's book Possum Magic, by author Mem Fox, and the TV show The Animals of Farthing Wood.   

Since meeting on Married At First Sight last year, Elizabeth and her boyfriend Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are living as a couple.
