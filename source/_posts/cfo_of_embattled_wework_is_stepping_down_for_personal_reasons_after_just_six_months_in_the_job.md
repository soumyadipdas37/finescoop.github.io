WeWork's chief financial officer is stepping down 'for personal reasons' just six months after she took the post.

The troubled co-working company announced Kimberly Ross' resignation in a press release on Wednesday.  

Benjamin Dunham, who has served as CFO of WeWork Americas for the past two years, will take over from Ross beginning October 1, the company said. 

Ross' exit comes as WeWork, majority owned by SoftBank Group Corp, faces a tough business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a rush to work-from-home arrangements has weighed heavily on the company by reducing occupancy and increasing operating costs.  

The firm has weathered several significant leadership shakeups in the last year after  the departures of its co-founders, Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey. 

Neumann stepped down last fall amid rumors that he was being pushed out, and McKelvey followed his lead in June.

WeWork CEO Sandeep Mathrani shared his excitement at Dunham's promotion in Wednesday's press release.  

'I am grateful to have Ben join the executive team at WeWork, continuing to build on the strong foundation laid by Kimberly,' Mathrani said. 

'With Ben's previous experience leading global companies and his current role as CFO of WeWork Americas, I feel confident that he has the experience, leadership capabilities and vision to help WeWork achieve long-term success, streamline our expenses and ultimately achieve our financial goals.' 

Dunham is quoted as saying: 'It's a momentous time to be at WeWork, as the value of flexible space has never been stronger. With the hard work that our company has undertaken over the past year, we are well on the path to profitability and I look forward to partnering with Sandeep and the leadership team to achieve our vision.'
