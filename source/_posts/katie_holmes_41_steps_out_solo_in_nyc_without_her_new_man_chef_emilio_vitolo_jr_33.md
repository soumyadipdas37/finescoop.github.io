Emilio Vitolo Jr. and Katie have been spotted together outside at his father's popular restaurant Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan several times in the last week.

Emilio is often seen chatting with his father Emilio Vitolo Sr., who owns the restaurant. 

They were first spotted together on Tuesday, September 1 on a date at Mediterranean restaurant Antique Garage in Soho; the duo were laughing and smiling at each other.

On Sunday, September 6, the duo confirmed their romance with a hot and heavy make out session at Peasant Restaurant in Manhattan; the actress sat on his lap as they kissed each other passionately.  

Since then, they've been seen on multiple occasions together with major PDA. 

In its positive review of Emilio's Ballato, New York Magazine noted the restaurant has a 'clubby' atmosphere, partly due to Emilio Sr., who decides which customers gets a table and in what order they'll be served from his spot at the front.

Despite the insular style, plenty of celebrities have been drawn to the restaurants classic Italian dishes, including former President Barack Obama and Hollywood stars Tom Hanks and Bradley Cooper. 

Last week, DailyMail.com published photos of the chef and the 41-year-old Dawson's Creek star locking lips outside of his restaurant just feet away from his father, who kindly averted his eyes.

On Wednesday, DailyMail.com also revealed that Vitolo broke it off with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text when handsy photos of him and Holmes were first published, leaving the handbag designer shocked and forcing her to move back home. 

Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019, and she doesn't seem to have been bothered by his engagement.  

Katie and Emilio first met when a mutual friend introduced them, and their passions have only intensified since she returned home to New York City following time quarantining with her family in Ohio.  

An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.

The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with the playboy actor, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.

The acting couple were first linked in 2013 hand-in-hand through Malibu, but they kept their relationship private throughout the years.

The couple finally split after they took their relationship public last year at the Met Gala.

Prior to coupling up with Foxx, Holmes was married to Hollywood icon Tom Cruise.

The couple began their whirlwind courtship in 2005 and were married in seven weeks.

Katie filed for divorce in 2012, which was finalized after only ten days.

She and Cruise had welcomed their daughter Suri in 2006, who now spends her time with Katie, who has primary custody.
