She was recently left devastated when her pet puppy Rolo passed away.

But Katie Price's teenage daughter Princess was showing off her makeup skills as she posed for a cute selfie on Tuesday.

The teenager, 13, sported a full face of makeup and false lashes as she showed off her pouting skills for the snap with makeup artists Zoe James.

Princess sported heavy false eyelashes and pink lipgloss as she appeared in the sweet snap with Zoe.

The teen has clearly taken after her famous mum when it comes to her makeup skills, which Katie shared with fans on Instagram.

She penned the caption: 'My gorgeous @officialprincess_andre did @zoejamesmua makeup and her own they are both beautiful inside and out.'

Katie herself has previously come under fire for gifting her youngest daughter Bunny, five, with a large collection of makeup.

In a video shared on Katie's Instagram at the weekend, an ecstatic Bunny could barely contain her excitement as she showed off a huge pile of make-up including lip gloss, mascara and nail polish.

However, not everyone was enthusiastic about Katie and Bunny's make-up haul as some hit out at the reality star for allowing her young daughter to have so much cosmetics, with some stating: 'she's still a child.'

However, several were quick to defend the star, highlighting that it is harmless fun and that most little girls love to experiment with their mum's make-up.

Katie shares Bunny with her ex-husband Kieran Hayler. They also have six-year-old son Jett.

Princess was also left devastated back in July when her adorable pet puppy Rolo was killed in a 'tragic accident.'

Katie was reportedly distraught after the French bulldog was found dead, mere weeks after she bought him for Princess' 13th birthday. 

Princess also took to Instagram to pet a heartbreaking tribute to Rolo, saying she 'missed him already' along with a gallery of snaps of her pet.
