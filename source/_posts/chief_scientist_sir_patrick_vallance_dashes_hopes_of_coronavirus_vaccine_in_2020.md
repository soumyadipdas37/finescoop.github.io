A coronavirus vaccine may not be available until the spring leaving Britons in the lurch over Christmas, the Government's Chief Scientific Advisor has warned.

Sir Patrick Vallance told a Downing Street press briefing this afternoon that although research is 'progressing' the vaccine may still be at least four months away.

'Vaccines are progressing, some will read out this year in terms of efficacy and safety,' he said. 'I think there's a reasonable chance that therefore we can think about the possibility of vaccination next year some time at larger levels.' 

It comes after the Oxford vaccine trial was put on hold this morning after a volunteer was rushed to hospital with suspected swelling in their spinal cord. 

UK drug giant AstraZeneca, which owns the rights to the vaccine, said last night that all studies of the jab had been paused indefinitely while it investigates whether the patient's side-effect is connected to the vaccine.

The jab had been expected at the end of 2020 but on Monday its creators sought to dampen expectations, with Matt Hancock warning it would not be available until the 'first few months of 2021'. 

The Government announced the tightening of lockdown restrictions in England this morning, and said Britons will not be able to meet in groups larger than six from Monday.

Almost 3,000 new coronavirus cases have been recorded daily for the past four days, a level that has not been seen since mid-May.

Russia will begin offering its coronavirus vaccine to volunteers this week, amid warnings that it has not been properly tested in human trials. 

The Sputnik V, which is based on the vaccine for adenovirus or the common cold, has been fast-tracked to production after less than two months of human testing.

Health minister Mikhail Murashko announced today that it would be made available to the population, according to the TASS news agency.

President Vladimir Putin has previously claimed it is safe and that he tested it on his own daughter. 'I know it works quite effectively, forms strong immunity, and, I repeat, it has passed all the needed checks,' he said at a government meeting on state television last month. 

But scientists in Russia have questioned the speed of its development, and warned it could have side-effects if offered to the public too early.





Admitting the Oxford vaccine would not be available this year, Hancock told LBC radio on Monday: 'The best-case scenario is that (the vaccine's roll out) happens this year. I think more likely is the early part of next year - in the first few months of next year is the most likely.

'But we've also bought vaccine ahead of it getting approved from a whole different series of international vaccines as well.'

As many as 30 million doses of the vaccine have been secured, and already being manufactured, ahead of it gaining approval. 

Sir Patrick Vallance said there are 200 possible vaccines in development globally and eight have entered the last stage of clinical trials.

'What we do know already is that many of these vaccines are showing the right immune response,' he said this afternoon.

'So people who have been vaccinated volunteers who've been vaccinated are generating an immune response to the virus.'

He said the Oxford vaccine is 'right at the front' in global efforts to find an immunisation bullet against the virus as 'it's been in more people than anyone else'.

'The trials as you've seen reported have been paused because of an investigation into a potential unwanted effect.

'That is not an unwanted thing in a phase three programme. We need  to make sure with these vaccines that they work, that they work well enough and that they are safe.'

There have been 12 more deaths of Covid-19 in the UK. Britain's death toll will be officially announced by the Department of Health this afternoon and may be different to the preliminary total calculated by adding up deaths reported by each home nation



The Government's move to tighten coronavirus restrictions has sparked fears that families Christmas gatherings could be disrupted.

But seeking to pour cold water on the fears, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News that although the restrictions are there for the 'foreseeable future' they will be withdrawn if the number of new cases starts to fall again.

'Three months is a long time in a pandemic,' he insisted. 

'Christmas is a long way off. I really hope that we can turn this around before Christmas. We've got to make sure that right now people both understand the rules and follow them.'

It is unclear what the exact nature of the reaction to the Oxford vaccine was, but the New York Times quoted a source claiming the patient had transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord that can cause permanent paralysis.

The disorder can be triggered from a number of causes that set off the body’s inflammatory responses, including viral infections, which is what a vaccine is intended to do.

Trials for AstraZeneca's shot are underway in the US, UK, Australia, Brazil (pictured) and other nations. Phase 3 testing will now be paused while safety data is reviewed 

The jab was expected at the end of 2020 but its creators have had to temper expectations after community transmission began to fizzle out in Britain and stall crucial trials needed to seal its approval. It was called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 before Oxford teamed up with AstraZeneca to manufacture it 

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the pause to the Oxford vaccine trial is not necessarily a setback and that trials of the jab were put on hold over summer when a patient fell ill.

He told Sky News: 'It is obviously a challenge to this particular vaccine. It's not actually the first time it has happened to the Oxford vaccine and it's a standard process in clinical trials.'

Asked if it will push back the roll-out of the vaccine, Mr Hancock said: 'Not necessarily - it depends on what they find when they do the investigation. There was a pause earlier in the summer and that was resolved without a problem.'

The UK's coronavirus task force has secured access to six of the vaccines in development, providing they are found to work.

They are also in four different classes of vaccine, meaning that the failure of one should not impact the others.

1. GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur: 60million doses 

The Government revealed on July 29 it had signed a deal with pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur

If the vaccine proves successful, the UK could begin to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk from coronavirus, as early as the first half of next year, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. 

Human clinical studies of the vaccine will begin in September followed by a phase 3 study in December. 

The vaccine is based on the existing technology used to produce Sanofi's seasonal flu vaccine. Genetic material from the surface protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is inserted into insect cells - the basis of Sanofi's influenza product - and then injected to provoke an immune response in a human patient.  

2. AstraZeneca (manufacturing University of Oxford's): 100million

AstraZeneca, which is working in partnership with Oxford University, is already manufacturing the experimental vaccine after a deal was struck on May 17.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading the Oxford team, is confident the jab could be ready for the most vulnerable people by the end of the year.

Her comments came after the results from the first phase, published in The Lancet on July 20, showed promise.

The team have genetically engineered a virus to look like the coronavirus - to have the same spike proteins on the outside - but be unable to cause any infection inside a person. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. 

3.  BioNTech/Pfizer: 30million 

US drug giant Pfizer - most famous for making Viagra - and German firm BioNTech were revealed to have secured a deal with the UK Government on July 20.

It reported positive results from the ongoing phase 2/3 clinical trial of one called BNT162b1 on July 1.  The company is still running phase 2 trials at the moment.

Pfizer's vaccine is one called an mRNA vaccine, which do not directly inject bits of the virus into the body but send genetic material.

mRNA vaccines programme the body to produce parts of the virus itself by injecting the body with a molecule that tells disease-fighting cells what to build. The immune system then learns how to fight it.

4. Valneva: 60million 

The Government has given Valneva — whose vaccine is understood to be in the preclinical stages of development — an undisclosed amount of money to expand its factory in Livingston, Scotland. 

While the Government revealed a 60million dose deal on July 20, the company said it had reached agreement in principle with the UK government to provide up to 100million doses. 

Valneva's jab is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, meaning it injects a damaged version of the coronavirus itself into the body.

The virus has been destroyed in a way that makes it unable to cause infection, but the body still recognises it as a dangerous intruder and therefore mounts an immune response which it can remember in case of a real Covid-19 infection. 

5. Janssen (Johnson & Johnson): 30million

The Government has agreed to buy 30million doses of a vaccine made by Janssen if it works.

Officials have agreed to help the company in its development of the jab by part-funding a global clinical trial. The first in-human trials of Janssen's jab began in mid-July and are being done on adults over the age of 18 in the US and Belgium.

The jab is named Ad26.COV2-S, recombinant, and is a type of jab called a viral vector recombinant vaccine.

Proteins that appear on the outside of the coronavirus are reproduced in a lab and then injected into the body to stimulate an immune reaction.

The 'Ad' part of the vaccine's name means it works using an adenovirus - a virus best known for causing the common cold - as a vehicle to transport the coronavirus genetics into the body.

6. Novavax: 60million

Britain has ordered 60million doses of a vaccine being developed by the US-based company Novavax. It will help to fund late-stage clinical trials in the UK and also boost plans to manufacture the vaccine in Britain.

Novavax's jab, named NVX-CoV2373, showed positive results in early clinical trials.

It produced an immune response in 100 per cent of people who received it, the company said, and was safe and 'generally well-tolerated'. 

Novavax's candidate is also a recombinant vaccine and transports the spike proteins found on the outside of the coronavirus into the body in order to provoke the immune system. 

7. Imperial College London: Unknown quantity

Imperial College London scientists are working on Britain's second home-grown hope for a jab. The candidate is slightly behind Oxford's vaccine in terms of its progress through clinical trials, but is still a major player.

The UK Government is understood to have agreed to buy the vaccine if it works but details of a deal have not yet been publicised. 

Imperial's jab is currently in second-phase human trials after early tests showed it appeared to be safe. 

Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream.
