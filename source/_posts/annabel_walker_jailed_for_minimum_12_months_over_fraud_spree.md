A glamorous socialite who stole $26,000 in goods and lied about getting psychiatric help for lying will spend at least a year behind bars for her 'shocking' spree of crimes.

Annabel Walker, 32, was led out of the Downing Centre Local Court in handcuffs on Wednesday after being sentenced to 12 months in prison without parole.

The jail term is an incredible downfall for Walker a one-time student at Frensham, a prestigious $30,000-a-year boarding school in the NSW southern highlands region.

Walker pleaded guilty in July to the spate of charges relating to luxury hotel stays, goods and other services which she never paid for.

But on the eve of her sentence date she parted ways with her legal team, leaving her to represent herself in court.

That move did not end well with Walker's mother and other relatives crying as she was led from the courtroom after Magistrate Susan McIntyre ordered she be jailed.

Annabel Walker (pictured), 32, has been jailed for at least 12 months over what a magistrate called a 'shocking' spree of fraud related crimes 

She admitted to taking $26,000 in hotel stays (pictured is the lavish Rae's on Wategos resort at Byron Bay where she stayed), products or services without every paying for them

The court heard how the socialite's solicitor Michael Moussa called her at 5.30pm on Tuesday night to recuse himself for the matter.

'It has literally been 12 hours since I found out, I haven't slept a wink,' Walker said. 

Mr Moussa had most recently represented Walker in late August when she was hit with further charges of lying about attending court ordered psychiatric treatment. 

The false document charges relate to the use of a fake letter claiming she'd attended mental health sessions, which police say she hadn't.

The allegations were first raised at Walker's last court appearance in July, with police applying then to have her put behind bars immediately.

'My instructions are they (police) have confirmed with the hospital that she hasn’t been admitted to the hospital since 2018,' prosecutor Craig Smith told the Downing Centre Local Court

'The police have been attempting to locate Ms Walker with a view to an arrest and detention application.' 

Walker fought back tears in July as Magistrate McIntyre told her she would be jailed for her crimes and slammed her 'disturbing history of dishonesty'.

Magistrate McIntyre did not miss in a scathing assessment of Walker, telling her the only thing left to decide was if she would receive a full time or suspended sentence.

'Given her shocking record, two breaches of a CCO (community corrections order) and how many drive while disqualified's (she's had) in the last ten years... imprisonment or an alternative is a real prospect,' Magistrate McIntyre said. 

'Actually, that is what's going to happen, it is just how that imprisonment is served.'

The court heard that Walker obtained a total of $17, 981 from her former employer in Australian Leisure Group. 

On the eve of her sentence date Ms Walker parted ways with her legal team including Sydney solicitor Michael Moussa (right), and was left to represent herself in court 

Wednesday's sentencing is the latest in a long downfall for the former student at Frensham, a boarding school in the NSW southern highlands which costs up to $30,000-a-year to attend 

Walker failed to pay $2,030 for a printing job, $3,361.60 for lighting and $2,816 for a sign to be painted as well as thousands in products from Harvey Norman

There was also $2,030 for a printing job, $3,361.60 for lighting and $2,816 for a sign to be painted.

Walker had also stayed at the lavish Rae's on Wategos resort in Byron Bay and bought products from a Harvey Norman store, none of which she paid for.

Walker sat quietly in court clutching a tissue tightly in her hand throughout the day.

When she was finally called to give evidence in relation to her bail conditions Walker fought back years as she told how she'd lost her job and moved away from Sydney's eastern suburbs after being charged.

'When I was charged I lived in Darlinghurst, but after I moved down to the Southern Highlands to be close to my family,' Walker said.

'I recently lost my lease and property after an article in the local paper about me.'

Outside court Mr Moussa told Daily Mail Australia that Walker was now ready to 'get on with her life'. 

Walker grew up in the Southern Highlands before moving to Sydney's glitzy eastern suburbs 

 Downing Centre Local Court had previously heard Walker was ready to get on with her life, but she will now have to spend at least 12 months in prison before she can do so

'She's had a very hard time and she’s learned from her experience and she now just wants to get on with her life,' he said.

'The last year has been very difficult and she has sought the appropriate assistance that she needs and now she's good as gold.'

In addition to the fraud charges, Walker was also be re-sentenced over a number of driving offences. 

She will serve at least 12 months behind bars and will be eligible for parole
