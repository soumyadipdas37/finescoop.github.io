A Sydney mother, 31, shared gushing posts about her five-year-old boy describing him as her 'little prince' and praying he grew up 'obedient' and 'smart'. 

That's before her boyfriend, 20, allegedly beat the boy within an inch of his life with a pole or stick last Friday night and both were charged by police.

NSW Police will allege it was an attempted 'disciplining' which left the child head-to-toe in bruises, suffering brain damage and riddled with splinters. 

Daily Mail Australia can now reveal how the Cabramatta mother presented herself as the most doting of parents before NSW Police found the boy late last week.

The child allegedly suffered the most serious injuries from suspected abuse that a veteran Westmead Children's Hospital doctor said he has seen in his entire career. 

But there was never any sign of anything untoward from the mother on social media - where she crowed to friends about how devoted she was to her boy. 

'You are all of my life,' she said. 

The mother - who can't be identified for legal reasons - described the five-year-old as her 'little prince'. On right, he dresses as a construction worker and poses with his favourite toy

The mother candidly described how the boy had been born premature at just 27 weeks and said he had blossomed into a 'good boy'. 

'He has done his journey very well to become a good boy today and love me with all of his heart,' she wrote.

In May, she described him as 'my biggest present for Mother's Day' and each year shared photos of him celebrating his birthday. 

To mark the child's fifth birthday, she wrote, according to a translation: 'This time 5 years ago, mum was still in pain, but now my son has grown up like this.

'I don't want anything but hope you will be obedient, eat well and grow up quickly, smart and fast. 

'Mum is happy now. Happy Birthday to my little prince.'   

Other material shows the child holding hands with a little girl and scurrying about the front yard with a toy earthmover. 

Neighbours have told how he would play in the front yard of the mother's home about twice a week.

The mother was arrested on Friday evening and was charged with the offence of 'not provide for child cause danger of serious injury'. Her boyfriend was charged with wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

The 20-year-old man accused of beating the five-year-old 'within an inch of his life' appeared calm during a brief appearance in front of a magistrate on Tuesday

Court documents revealed police are investigating whether the man's alleged abuse of the boy occurred just last Friday evening or over the two previous months. 

A magistrate on Saturday said he had seen 'very disturbing' photos of the boy's injuries. 

Magistrate Peter Miszalski said: 'What started off smacking the victim to discipline, ended with the victim being severely injured.'

Both have been denied bail, with the mother to face court next week, and her boyfriend due to return in front of a magistrate in eight weeks' time. 

Police gather outside the home the night after the alleged 'smacking' incident escalated into a suspected case of child abuse 

A police charge sheet tendered in court this week accused the mother's boyfriend 'intentionally wounding' the child 'between the 1st day of July 2020 and the 28th day of August 2020.' 

A senior source with knowledge of the police investigation said the boy's injuries will be investigated bruise-by-bruise to see if he was allegedly beaten 'just on the Friday night or earlier'.

Whether there is evidence of him facing ongoing abuse will come from doctors. 

'These types of investigations rely heavily on medical evidence and that's quite time consuming,' the police source said.  

The investigation continues.

Westmead Children's Hospital surgeon Dr Adam Fowler tweeted that the boy's injuries made him 'physically sob whilst examining'

The boy was rushed to hospital last week and placed on life support. 

He remained in a critical but stable condition on Wednesday. 

A neurosurgeon at Westmead Children's Hospital tweeted on Saturday that the boy's injuries 'made me physically sob.'

'The worst case of suspected child beating I've seen in my professional career,' Dr Adam Fowler tweeted.

The messages were later deleted.
