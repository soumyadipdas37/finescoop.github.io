South Korean boy band group BTS electrified viewers as they performed their new hit single Dynamite on Wednesday during the America's Got Talent results show.

Their song, which recently debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, is the band's first tune to be sung completely in English.

The seven-member group performed it on a variety of sets at Universal Studios Hollywood, where AGT is filmed, as a sign blaring 'Dynamite' glowed brightly behind them.

Hit single: South Korean boy band group BTS, including Jungkook, electrified viewers as they performed their new hit single Dynamite on Wednesday during the America's Got Talent results show

They danced around a drive-in, gas station, and amusement park to the wild cheering of AGT fans, who were watching live and streamed from a stack of TV screens on set.

Viewers also enjoyed a visit by a former AGT star who brought some big names to his act.

Scottish mentalist Colin Cloud, 33, who'd appeared on AGT season 12, had earlier asked the audience to bring pendulums of some kind to the show, and hold them aloft.

He tasked the judges with writing down a random word that popped into their heads, and waited until everyone's pendulums stopped swaying.

Colin then guessed correctly that Heidi Klum's word had been 'yo-yo,' Howie Mandel's was 'Paris,' and Sofia Vergara's was 'Happy,' from the 2013 Pharrell Williams song.

He then showed a pre-taped video in which  AGT winners magician Shin Lim, 28, ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer, 15, and singer Kodi Lee, 24, parroted those answers.

The show's last semifinals episode of season 15 saw AGT's remaining 11 acts whittled down to five, all of them hoping for a shot at the $1 million grand prize.

The first person voted through was Cristina Rae, a singer from Nashville who'd survived homelessness to move the judges with her cover of Cynthia Erivo's Jump.

'We will end this journey together,' said Heidi, 47, who'd given Cristina her Golden Buzzer during auditions. 'I am so excited for you. You are a huge inspiration to so many people.'

Cristina was followed by Daneliya Tuleshova, a 14-year-old vocalist from Kazhakstan, who had given a brassy, mature performance of Jessie J.'s Who You Are.

Asked what advice she might impart to a weeping Daneliya, Sofia, 48, said, 'I don't think I have to tell her anything. She knows what she's doing. She's already a star.'

The Bello Sisters, a trio of Italian acrobats aged 13, 19, and 22, won the third open slot after impressing the judges with their ability to balance and contort their bodies.

'I think America made the right choice,' Howie, 64, said. 'We've seen acrobats and athletes before, but never three beautiful women with that kind of strength.'

Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, then earned the show's Dunkin' Save slot, scoring votes for her version of Thomas Rhett's Be A Light.

'I was sitting here hoping it was going to be you,' Heidi said. 'You are absolutely incredible.'

The fifth act to go through was Bad Salsa, the Kolkata, India-based dance duo who'd emerged from poverty and made a name for themselves with their rapid-fire moves.

They were saved by judges Howie and Sofia, who knew what it meant to them and already thought of them as 'international sensations' for their dizzying, electrifying routines.

Those going home included Las Vegas mentalist Max Major; singer Celina Graves, 30; San Diego's The Voices Of Our City Choir; New York City dance group W.A.F.F.L.E. Crew; Welsh daredevil Jonathan Goodwin, 40; and North Carolina street performer Brett Loudermilk, 31.

America's Got Talent will air its finale and results show next week on NBC.
