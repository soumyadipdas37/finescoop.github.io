Niecy Nash wed her longtime friend, 41-year-old Jessica Bett, last month.

And in the new issue of People, the 50-year-old Claws actress explains she is thrilled with her choice to tie the knot with the musician. 'I’ve got the greatest love of my life... I couldn’t be happier,' said the Hollywood veteran.

And she added that it really makes no difference what gender her spouse is: 'My marriage has absolutely nothing to do with gender and it has everything to do with her soul,' said the star. 'She is the most beautiful soul I have ever met in my life.' 

 You know it’s love by the way it feels ❤️🧡💛💚 Thank you @jessicabettsmusic for all the feels 🥰

The performer also shared many details of her wedding: the ceremony took place at their $2M home in Ventura County, California, on August 29 in front of 24 guest. Their mini honeymoon was in Santa Barbara.

The wedding came as a surprise because she had just divorced her husband Nash, Jay Tucker in March.  

 'I don’t feel like my marriage is my coming out of anywhere, but rather a going into myself and being honest about who I love. And I’m not limiting myself on what that love is supposed to look like.' 

The beauty also wants her fans to know that she was not hiding holding anything back. 'I was not suppressing my sexuality my whole life,' said the TV star. 'I love who I love. At one point in my life, I married twice and I love those people. And today I love this person.

'I've done everything I wanted to do on my own terms and my own way. So my choice now in a partner has nothing to do with who I've always been. It's a matter of who I am in this moment.'

Nash also shared she became close friends with Jessica in 2015.

But at the time she was happy with her husband Jay and she did not see the singer as someone she would date. 

But then in October 2019, Niecy told the site, something changed.

'I loved her before I was in love with her because she is such a special human being,' said Nash.

'But we began to see each other in a way we never had before. Sometimes you get so broken by love, you run from it. But I’ve learned that you should always hold space for magic because it can happen at any time.'  

Nash and Betts broke the news of their wedding last week on Instagram. 'I love my wife,' said the TV wonder in one caption.

Then Nash said the 'I love my wife,' adding 'Our Betts is yet to come❤️.'  

Niecy looked lovely in a strapless white gown with a mermaid finish and her singer wife had on a shirt and tie with vest and slacks during an outdoor ceremony.

She added a hashtag for Jessica Betts Music and said 'love wins.' 

The photographer was credited as Robert Ector.

Chicago native Jessica shared the exact same photo as she said, 'I got a whole Wife.' The post was the first time Niecy, who is a supporter of the LGBTQ community, has shared that she has been romantically linked to Jessica.

The star was smiling as she held up her pink rose bouquet with one hand and in the other held the hand of her new wife while the two walked on a white floor.

 I keep a smile on that face! 😍 @jessicabettsmusic ❤️💍#bettsofbothworlds #LoveWins 🌈@robertector 📷

Niecy had on a white gown with no straps and a sweetheart neckline. 

Her waist was tiny and was further accentuated by the mermaid finish of her skirt.

Her hair was worn down and her makeup was beautifully done. Her wife had on a white shirt with tie and slacks with tennis shoes and flashed her new gold wedding band.

The Scream Queens star also shared an image with her new wife on Instagram Stories with a hashtag for 'plot twist.' 

The two go back in time. Jessica sang at Niecy's wedding to Jay in 2011 in Malibu.  

In June 2018 the two were together on the set of Claws and two months later, Betts posted a video where she was singing to the star at her wedding to Tucker: 'This woman of God, I’m honored and blessed in her presence. She’s anointed and appointed. She singin my tune.'

In February, Jessica shared a topless photo of Niecy to Instagram to wish her a happy birthday. 'Happy Birthday to a Real One,' said the songbird.

'Wishing you both happiness': Filmmaker Ava DuVernay shared an image from the ceremony on social media and said it had been 'an honor' to witness their wedding

In October, DailyMail.com exclusively reported that the couple's troubles began amid strain over living in different cities, Nash's graphic sex scenes on television and her sexy new look.

In her property settlement, the actress 'gets their house in Bell Canyon, CA and the 2016 Tesla. She also gets to keep her production company, Chocolate Chick,' TMZ reported.

Additionally, the outlet said that Jay, who is an electrical engineer, will keep his 2011 Ford F-150 truck and a $184,820 payout from his ex-wife.

The money is Tucker's cut from the sale of a property they once shared, and aside from that, both parties agreed not to request spousal support. 

Interestingly, prior to news of their split being made public, Nash had quietly listed the Bell Canyon home for $1.2 million in July of 2019.

According to sources who spoke with DailyMail.com, the couple had been having issues for nearly two years prior to finally calling it quits. 

Betts was there for the last wedding: The two go back in time. Jessica sang at Niecy's wedding to Jay in 2011 in Malibu

Niecy and Jay were married in Malibu in 2011 but their relationship took a turn in part due to the star's full-body cosmetic surgery makeover and her 'extreme career ambitions.'

A source close to the former couple told DailyMail.com at the time: 'Niecy got a brand new body right before she went to film Claws down in New Orleans and that's when their troubles began. Jay was really uncomfortable with her graphic sex scenes on the show and that made their problems worse.

'They were living in two different cities and Jay expressed he didn't like his wife being in New Orleans while he was in LA.'

When the comedy-drama had its big premiere in LA in June of 2017, Tucker didn't attend because the couple had been fighting about the show, according to the source.

And while Tucker did attend Nash's ceremony for her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the summer of 2018, he wasn't by her side in September when she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie for her role in When They See Us.

Niecy was also previously married to Don Nash from 1994 to 2007.
