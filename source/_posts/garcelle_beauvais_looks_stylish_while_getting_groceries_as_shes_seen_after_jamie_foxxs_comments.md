She recently hosted a very amusing podcast episode in which she got some major attention from her former TV love interest Jamie Foxx. 

And Garcelle Beauvais looked quite content in Los Angeles, California on Friday, as she simultaneously made a grocery run and also picked up a coffee.

The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star, 53, was lovely in a yellow button-down shirt, which she paired with flared denim jeans.

Garcelle alternately carried her leopard print face mask and tucked it in her open collar.

She wore flip flops and both her bright pedicure as well as manicure were visible in the afternoon sun.  

The mother-of-three wore classic dark sunshades, and let her long black hair cascade down around her shoulders.

The sighting comes one day after Beauvais hosted the latest episode of her podcast Going To Bed With Garcelle, on which her old costar Foxx appeared.

The Oscar winner, who starred opposite Garcelle in his eponymous series The Jamie Foxx Show from 1996 until 2001, said he though that they 'should have been together' in real life during their chat.  

While bantering with Beauvais, Foxx, 52, joked that when he sees the actress and reality star with another man, he thinks he 'f***ed up.'

During the cheerful conversation Garcelle told Jamie: 'By the way, you never really give any guy that I’m with any real attention.'

In response, Jamie dished that this was 'Because me and you, we should’ve been together. So every time I see him, I was like: "Damn, I f***ed up."'

The result is that whenever he meets a beau of hers 'I give him a real s***y look,' to which Garcelle replied: 'I feel it! I feel it and they feel it.' 

During the cheerful conversation Garcelle told Jamie: 'By the way, you never really give any guy that I’m with any real attention'; seen with fellow guest, stylist Mayasha Long 

Both of them declared themselves 'single' on the podcast, as did decorator and stylist Mayasha Long who was Jamie's fellow guest on the episode. 

During the chat, Jamie and Garcelle also jokingly agreed that they are 'in a relationship forever,' and she added, rather saucily, that he is 'also hung like a horse.' 

Previously, Beauvais has referred to her relationship with Foxx as more of a brother-sister bond, as they not only worked on their WB sitcom for five years, but also costarred in at least one feature film together – White House Down in 2013.
