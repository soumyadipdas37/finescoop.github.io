Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt watched on as Salford were thrashed in their first meeting with Manchester United on Wednesday night.

United's Class of 92 legends and co-owners of the League Two club were all in attendance in the stands at the Peninsula Stadium for the Leasing.Com Trophy clash.

They saw the emergence of a new crop of United youngsters as the Under 21 side eased to a 6-0 victory.

Hannibal Mejbri put United ahead in just the eighth minute before Amau Puigmal doubled the visitors' lead on the half-hour mark.

Mark Helm allayed any fears of a Salford comeback with United's third early in the second half. Charlie McCann added a fourth before Helm found the net again and Anthony Elanaga made it six.
