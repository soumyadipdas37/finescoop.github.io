Captioning the images, she wrote: 'The most classy woman I’ve ever known. Beautiful inside and out. So much fun, always there when you needed her and so so clever. I am empty.' 

The shared photos illustrated Jodie's close bond with her mother and including snaps of them walking their dogs, readying themselves for glamorous nights out and preparing for Christmas.

Jodie also tweeted a collection of snaps from Kristina's life, including one of the mother-daughter pair in matching sparkling pink gowns.

Alongside the video, Jodie wrote: 'This just came up on my Facebook. It's me and my parents at @SimplyRedHQ - my mum is so cute and my dad is so dad like [laughing emojis].'

Jodie shared the same video to her Instagram, reiterating that she is hoping for her mother's health to return.

She also previously claimed her ill mother was 'thrown out of hospital because of coronavirus.'

In May, the star responded to a tweet by charity Balls To Cancer, which urged sufferers to still 'get advice from doctors and visit A&E' amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bodybuilder disagreed with the organisation's statement, insisting her parent was 'turfed out' of a health facility and told to 'come back in eight weeks' with no treatment for her 'aggressive growing cancer'.

Balls To Cancer wrote: 'We cannot say it enough. THE NHS IS OPEN please do not sit at home with any cancer symptoms, get to speak to your doctor or visit A & E.

'The figures in cancer diagnosis are drastically down. Please remember lives are saved by early detection! Please RT.'

Sharing Kristina's experience of dealing with cancer amid the global crisis, the media personality explained: 'Not quite true.

'My mum was basically turfed out of hospital and told ''come back in 8 weeks'' even though she has the most aggressive growing cancer her consultant had ever seen. 

'Thrown out of hospital because of COVID. No treatment. She's dying at home. No word from hospital.'

'That's Terrible Jodie. Very sorry to hear that. What NHS trust is that?' [sic], the charity responded as many social media users detailed similar hospital incidents during the UK's recent lockdown.

The Celebrity Big Brother star later reached out to musician Barry Manilow to ask whether he could wish her mum well amid her cancer battle.

She wrote:' @barrymanilow hi there, it’s a big ask I know but my mum is fading fast with terminal cancer & she & I saw Barry live together in the UK at least 30 times over the years. She loves him.

'Is there any chance of getting a 10 second video from Barry for her to wish her well please?' [sic]

MailOnline contacted Jodie's representatives for further comment at the time.
