It may be one of Australia's longest-running TV shows.

But Home and Away suffered a rookie error this week after fans noticed a bizarre detail in the background of a café scene.

The scene was centred around two cast members having a conversation next to the salad bar, but viewers couldn't help but notice a female extra pretending to chop vegetables in the background.

 

And... cut! A bizarre Home and Away gaffe went viral this week after viewers noticed an extra awkwardly pretending to chop vegetables in the background of a café scene 

The knife hovered above the chopping board as the actress made cutting motions without actually touching the lettuce leaves.

The clip has since gone viral, with Nova FM's Kate, Tim & Joel uploading the hilarious footage to Instagram on Monday.

'Poor actors! This extra was seen fake-chopping in the background of a scene in Home & Away (Channel 7),' the post was captioned.

Coincidentally, one of the Nova FM radio hosts, Kate Ritchie, actually rose to fame playing Sally Fletcher on the soap. 

Insert chopping sound here? Rather than chopping the vegetables, the actress simply hovered the knife above the lettuce for a few seconds and made cutting motions

Home and Away bosses defended the gaffe by insisting the extra was prioritising environmental sustainability by reusing the same vegetables for multiple takes.

As a background character, the actress presumably would have had to 'chop vegetables' for some time before the scene finally wrapped.

'No greens were harmed in the making of this episode. #ReduceReuseRecycle,' read a lighthearted statement on Home and Away's Instagram account.

Home and Away and its rival soap Neighbours have long been hailed as the 'golden ticket' for aspiring actors looking to establish themselves on Australian TV. 

Set in the fictional town of Summer Bay, the show has given a slew of stars their start - including Isla Fisher, Chris Hemsworth, Melissa George and Guy Pearce.

Home and Away airs weekdays at 1.15pm and 6pm on Channel 5 (UK) and Mondays to Thursdays at 7pm on Channel Seven (Australia)
