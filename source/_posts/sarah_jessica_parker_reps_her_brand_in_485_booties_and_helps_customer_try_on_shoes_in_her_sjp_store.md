SJP Collection CEO Sarah Jessica Parker squatted down to better help a customer safely try on shoes inside her boutique in Manhattan's Seaport District on Wednesday.

The Ohio-born 55-year-old made sure to rep her own six-year-old accessories brand by wearing the $485 'Minnie' booties in 'scintillate.'

Sarah protected herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a $20 Masqd 'Noir' mask, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made mandatory for all public outings way back on April 15.

Parker finished off her boss lady look with a silver sparkly blazer over a black-striped long-sleeve top, and cuffed blue jeans.

Ironically, Parker's new flagship boutique on West 54th Street in Midtown used to be Manolo Blahnik's boutique until closing in November.

'We were both thrilled and daunted by its history,' the four-time Golden Globe winner told Footwear News on Tuesday.

'Yes, I have memories in this building, in this store. I have real, sincere memories of making those purchases, not making purchases, looking at stuff, and then its role in Sex and the City, and the way we got to be in this store.'
