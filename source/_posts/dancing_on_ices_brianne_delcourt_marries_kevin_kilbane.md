Dancing On Ice's Brianne Delcourt has married Kevin Kilbane.

Brianne, 39, revealed she had been due to marry Kevin, 43, in a big wedding in Ireland on Friday, but the coronavirus pandemic meant they had to cancel their plans.

However the couple were undeterred by the news and took to Instagram to post a photo of themselves toasting with champagne. 

Sparking speculation they had tied the knot, Brianne wrote: 'So, today was the day Kevin & I were supposed to be getting married in Ireland 09-04-2020. Damn you Covid..., so we celebrated our way .......'.

The professional skater looked gorgeous in a lace floral bridal dress which featured a plunging neckline.

Posing in front of a scenic sea backdrop,  Brianne's veil fluttered in the wind as footballer Kevin, who looked dapper in a tuxedo and bow tie, kissed her on the lips. 

The retired Everton ace also shared the photograph on Instagram and wrote: 'We celebrated our proposed wedding day anyway.. I love you'.   

Brianne and Kevin first met in October when they were partnered on Dancing On Ice, and they have been in a relationship since December.

The couple then got engaged just two months later after being eliminated from the show, with Kevin popping the question at a steakhouse in London.

Discussing the reaction over their whirlwind romance and engagement, Brianne mused: 'We wake up every day and say how blessed we feel. 

'I feel like I have known Kevin forever. I wish I had met him 20 years ago.' 

Previously speaking about her wedding plans, the blonde beauty told Hello Magazine: 'I have found The Dress, and our heart is set on getting married in Ireland, it will be so beautiful, and it is special to Kevin.'

Kevin’s late father was born in County Mayo in Ireland. 

The footballer added: 'Over the next month we are going there to introduce Brianne to my family, and to look at venues. We are going to set a date for September or October.'

The couple added that they intended to have two maids of honour and two best men, with Brianne adding she hopes her three-year-old daughter Gracie 'will be my flower-girl but she might just take over the whole day'.

Former footballer Kevin, who played for the Republic of Ireland national team -has two daughters, 16-year-old Elsie and 14-year-old Isla, with his ex-wife Laura, who he split from in 2011 after 12 years of marriage. 

Canadian skater Brianne raises daughter Gracie, three, with an unnamed ex. She has appeared on Dancing On Ice since 2010 but announced earlier this year she would not be taking part in next year's series. 

Brianne has hit the headlines with her past relationships, having previously romanced her Dancing On Ice celebrity partners Matt Lapinskas and Sam Attwater as well as Danny Young, who was partnered with Frankie Poultney.
