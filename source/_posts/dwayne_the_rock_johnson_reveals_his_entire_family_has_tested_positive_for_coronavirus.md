Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has revealed that his 'entire family' has tested positive for coronavirus. 

The 48-year-old revealed the news on Wednesday, saying that his wife Lauren Hashian, 35, and their two daughters all tested positive for COVID-19, but stated they're 'on the other end of it' and are 'no longer contagious.' 

He made the announcement on an Instagram video to his 196million followers, calling the diagnoses 'one of the most challenging and difficult' things that they've ever had to go through as a family.

'Testing positive for COVID-19 is a lot different than recovering from nasty injuries, getting evicted or being broke, which I've been more than a few times,' he began.

'My No. 1 priority is to always protect my family and my loved ones... I wish it was only me that tested positive. It was my entire family and it was a kick in the gut. We in a family are good, we're on the other end of it and no longer contagious. Thank God, we're healthy.'

He added: 'We are counting our blessings right now. We are well aware you don’t always get to the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier.'

'I have had some of my best friends lose their parents to this virus that is so incredibly relentless and unforgiving. We are counting our blessings, but we are good.'

The former wrestler is father to three daughters — 18-year-old Simone, from his previous marriage to ex-wife and manager Dany Garcia, and girls Jasmine and Tiana, whom he welcomed with wife Lauren in 2015 and 2018, respectively. 

It is not clear if Johnson was referring to his manager Dany and elder daughter Simone when he said his 'entire family' had been struck down with the virus. 

Despite his illness, it's been a busy time for the actor, who last month topped Forbes highest paid actors list, earning a staggering $87.5 million.
