Lisa Rinna revealed her 19-year-old daughter paid the $5,700-per-month rent on her Los Angeles apartment, without any financial support from her mom or dad.

During the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills reunion on Wednesday, the 57-year-old Melrose Place alum had only praise for her daughter, Amelia Gray Hamlin. 

'It's all her money,' Rinna told her costars, who appeared visibly impressed. 'I'm not even helping her a thousand dollars.'

The reality star elaborated that her teenager paid the substantial rent on the 900-square-foot home with her 'modeling money.'

'Amelia Gray makes more money than all of us,' Rinna gushed of her youngest, who has since moved into a house with her older sister, Delilah, according to Bravo.

RHOBH Viewers got a home tour of Amelia's former pad earlier this season, when she began her search for a new home with Kyle Richards' daughter Alexia Umansky.

On Amelia's wish list was a 'really modern and contemporary' property with 'a pretty kitchen island' and 'big windows.'

Upon seeing her apartment, she revealed she didn't mind 'size of the' tiny bedroom, as she is 'very used to a small room.'

Upon reflecting on her own first place of her own, Lisa said she lived in a '900-unit apartment building' that had roaches.  

'I was lucky to have an apartment with hand-me-down furniture and a door that locked,' she noted on the July 22 episode of RHOBH; seen with her two daughters in February
