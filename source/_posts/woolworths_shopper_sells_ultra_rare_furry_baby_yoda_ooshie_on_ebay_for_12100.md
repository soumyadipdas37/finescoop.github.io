'Baby Yoda Ooshies - Ultra Rare. First on eBay, individually numbered 059. Not to be confused with the normal green Yoda, this one is the baby and has felt/fur clothing,' the seller wrote in the eBay ad.

The sale ends on the evening of Saturday, September 19. 

The Child joins the 36-piece collectable set, featuring iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar.

The ultra rare furry Thor will also be in hot demand among shoppers, with just 100 of the figurines circulating around the country.

The rare collectables come just weeks after a 'leaked' picture on social media emerged revealing the never-before-seen 'furry' versions of Thor and The Child.
