Neil Buchanan has responded to rumours circulating on social media that claimed he is mysterious street artist Banksy.

The 58-year-old British TV personality who is best known for hosting children's programme Art Attack from 1990-2007, was speculated to be the elusive artist after a Twitter user's post about the conspiracy theory went viral.

Racking up over 2,000 re-tweets, the user wrote: 'Just heard that it's rumoured Neil Buchanan is Banksy. If true, it's the funniest s*** ever. Aintree's finest. 

'He's a musician and art has followed in the cities of shows he's done allegedly. This is straight in the "believe without question" category.'

A representative for Neil revealed they had been inundated with queries about the possibility of the TV personality being the artist because of a social media conspiracy theory 

A representative for Neil penned a statement on his website revealing they had been inundated with enquiries from people attempting to fact check the rumour.

Denying the suggestion, they wrote: 'Unfortunately this website does not have the infrastructure to answer all these enquiries individually, however we can confirm that there is no truth in the rumour whatsoever.

'​Neil spent lockdown with vulnerable members of his family and is now preparing to launch his new art collection in 2021. Thank you and please stay safe.'

Bristol native Banksy, has gained a reputation for his large art pieces in public spaces while managing to conceal his identity.

Various attempts to unmask Bansky whose most famous work includes Balloon Girl, Follow Your Dreams and London Underground Rats have been unsuccessful, with Robin Gunningham being the most commonly cited individual who could be the street artist.

Sparking the conspiracy theory, a Twitter user claimed Neil has often been in the same cities as Banksy's artwork 

This sneezing and coughing rat was at the centre of a Banksy artwork on the Tube earlier this year, carried out as the train passed through central London

The artwork was filmed being made and at one point Banksy ushered away a commuter from the part of the carriage he wanted to paint

Social media users recalled Neil creating large outdoor pieces on Art Attack as one of the reasons why they believe the conspiracy and admitted they will believe the rumour even if there isn't any direct evidence.

One person wrote: 'Heard the rumour that Banksy is Neil Buchanan and I need no evidence or proof or substance to it, it's absolutely the only thing I'm choosing to believe this year.'

'The rumour that 90s/00s icon Neil Buhanan is Banksy is simultaenously the best and weirdest thing to happen in 2020. And I've never wanted a conspiracy theory to be truer,' wrote another.

A third added: 'Neil Buchanan saying he's not Banksy seems an awful lot like something Banksy would say'













A stream of social media users said they would continue to believe the rumour even if there's no supporting evidence
