The Premier League's long-serving No 2 Bill Bush is reportedly set to leave the organisation after 15 years.

Richard Scudamore's departure from his role as executive chairman in November 2018 has heralded a period of upheaval among key figures, and Bush is now set to be the latest to step away.

The Athletic have claimed that Bush is not expected to leave imminently, but top flight clubs have been informed and the process of sourcing his replacement is already underway.

Richard Scuadmore's departure as executive chairman has seen changes among top figures

Bush became part of the Premier League's top table in 2005 after joining from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and has acted as the main link with the government. 

It is also believed that his role partly focused on intellectual property, an area of expertise that would have seen him heavily involved in the collapsed Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle. 

The same report also highlights Bush's involvement in supporter relations and brokering meetings between the league, the Football Supporters' Association and similar groups.

The imminent return of top flight action is understood to have been heavily influenced by Bush. His connections with government officials helped ensure a rapid turnaround between seasons despite the recent rise in coronavirus cases.

The league is targeting a strategy director to work closely with current chief Richard Masters

It has been claimed that all 20 clubs were reassured that Bush would continue to help out where necessary, and would not fully step away from his current responsibilities. 

The reshuffle among high-ranking officials at the Premier League will see two more senior executives brought in. 

A new head of planning is to be hired following the departure of Peta Bistany, and a new role has also been made available. 

The organisation is reportedly targeting a strategy director, whose remit would include helping current chief Richard Masters to create a direct connection with customers using a streaming platform.
