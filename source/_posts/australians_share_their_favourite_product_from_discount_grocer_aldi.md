A group of Australian Aldi customers have collated their 'must-have' products from the discount supermarket, including triple brie cheese, steak with truffle butter and a family-sized lasagne.

A fellow shopper was interested in knowing what everyone in the Aldi Mums Facebook group's 'holy grail' food choice was, anything fresh or frozen, and wasn't disappointed by the huge reply she got.

There were more than 590 comments in total - with many people giving more than one answer for their favourite product, unable to narrow them down.

'Omg I don't know where to start,' one woman said, before saying that she could only ever buy Aldi's Butterfully Butter. 

'I'm in love with the organic dark sea salt chocolate from Aldi,' said another loyal customer. 

A third added: 'I wish they would bring back the cookie dough ice cream they had in 2015 or maybe I am glad they don't have it anymore'.

One shopper's 'holy grail' item was the fresh Turducken at Christmas time, while another loved the roti bread in the freezer section because it's 'so handy to add to a quick dinner'.

By the end of the thread it was clear that there was no one section in Aldi stores that gifted better products than the others - they were all equally as good.

'My husband LOVES the steaks with the truffle butter. He thinks his life is over if he doesn't get them once a week,' one mother said.

While another said the 'melting moments' where her favourite, even though they made you put on 'bulk weight'.
