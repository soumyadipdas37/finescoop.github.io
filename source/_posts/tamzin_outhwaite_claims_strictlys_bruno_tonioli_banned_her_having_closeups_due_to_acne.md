Tamzin Outhwaite has claimed that Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli refused to let her star in close-ups for an advert in her 20s, as she was struggling with acne.

The actress spoke candidly about her skin battles during an appearance on Celebrity Skin Talk with Scott McGlynn, reflecting on a time she'd worked with Bruno on an ad for Freixenet sparkling wine.

She said: 'There have been times in my life where I've had such bad acne that it's affected my work. When I was in my early 20s, I was doing a champagne commercial as a champagne bubble. I had a little blonde wig.

'It was Don Johnson playing the piano. We were the champagne bubbles on the piano keys. We were in gold all-in-ones.' 

Bruno was our choreographer, we were filming in Barcelona. One morning my acne came up very bad around my jaw line, it was raised and it couldn't be covered.

'I remember Bruno said, 'I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to sit you out for this close up shot'. It was because of my acne. 

'I was mortified. I do remember feeling mortified that something so physical on my face was stopping me doing what I loved.'
