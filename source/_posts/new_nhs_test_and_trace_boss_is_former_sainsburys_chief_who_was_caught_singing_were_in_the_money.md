The new NHS Test and Trace boss is the former Sainsbury's chief executive of Sainsbury's who was caught singing 'we're in the money' when the supermarket was in talks over a mega-merger with Asda.

Mike Coupe, 60, who retired as chief executive officer of Sainsbury's at the end of May, is set to replace Sarah-Jane Marsh as testing director of the service.

Baroness Dido Harding, the head of England's test and trace system, said in an email to staff that Mr Coupe 'will bring a wealth of experience in large scale supply chains, logistics and digital transformation'.

Ms Marsh is returning to her post as chief executive of Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, and it is understood Mr Coupe will be in the role until Christmas.

In 2018, Mr Coupe was forced to apologise after being caught singing Broadway hit 'We're In The Money' in between media interviews about a merger with supermarket giant Asda.

The £12billion merger was later blocked by the Competition Authority watchdog because it would lead to higher prices for customers and damage competition.

In the email seen by the Health Service Journal (HSJ), Baroness Harding said: 'We have been incredibly privileged to be able to "borrow" Sarah-Jane for the last five months but it will soon be time for her to return to her substantive role as CEO of Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust.

'Sarah-Jane has led the team with unparalleled drive, compassion, and humour.'

She said Mr Coupe has 'worked for 35 years in the food retail industry and will bring a wealth of experience in large scale supply chains, logistics and digital transformation'.

The interim executive chairwoman of the National Institute for Health Protection added: 'Mike will undertake a period of induction over the next month, working with Sarah-Jane and the team across Testing, initially focused on scaling new testing technologies, and will take over the Testing helm when Sarah-Jane leaves us at the end of October.'  

Mr Coupe previously admitted Sainsbury's struggled due to panic-buying during the Covid-19 pandemic, revealing that for five days running at the start of the lockdown food sales were higher than the busiest shopping days at Christmas, leaving shelves largely empty.

He said: 'We sold more, for five days running, than we would normally sell in our busiest day at Christmas, that's why you saw the gaps on the shelf. We have seen a very marked change in the way our customers are shopping. 

'They're coming less frequently and are buying about twice as much when they do come. Very much a return to the weekly shop, but beyond it.' 

In reaction to the appointment, Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth tweeted: 'How about putting those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge of Test & Trace?

'Local public health teams should be leading contact tracing. That way we would have an effective Test, Trace & Isolate regime that helps control this virus.'

Earlier this month, Ms Marsh issued an apology to the thousands of people unable to get a test for Covid-19.
