Leicester Tigers are in danger of being taken to the High Court unless they pay out close to £750,000 to five players who were axed in the summer.

Greg Bateman, Kyle Eastmond, Noel Reid, Manu Tuilagi and Telusa Veainu had their contracts terminated by in July after refusing to accept a 25% pay cut.

All bar Eastmond have signed for new clubs on reduced salaries and have sought legal advice for lost earnings caused by unfair dismissal.

One source told the Mail on Sunday: ‘The players weren’t in agreement with the pay cut but that wasn’t a sackable offence. The club were 100% in breach of contract.’

The players’ total loss in earnings is close to £750,000 – with Tuilagi facing the biggest shortfall – and Leicester were given a 28-day window to reach a settlement.

The Mail on Sunday understands no offer has yet been made to the players, who are subsequently poised to sue the club for damages in the High Court.

Leicester Tigers declined the opportunity to comment.
