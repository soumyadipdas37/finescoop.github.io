A woman watched in disgust as security escorted a mentally ill man from a hospital ward and left him on the side of the road just a day after he was admitted with hypothermia.

The man was still wearing his hospital gown when he was left out the front of Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital on Sunday.  

He had been found a day earlier naked and in a swampy creek, suffering from hypothermia, the Courier-Mail reported. 

A woman was 'disgusted' when she watched security escort a mentally ill man from a hospital ward and leave him on the side of the road a day after he was admitted with hypothermia

Mother-of-three Hayley Birtles-Eades told the publication she was 'horrified' when she watched the man as he was 'frogmarched' out of the hospital.

'Protective services marched a mentally unwell and clearly unstable man out of the hospital... What the actual f**k is going on with the world?' she posted on Facebook after the incident.  

'This man is clearly unable to take care of himself, he’s a danger to himself and to the public, tossing him out on to a main road is NOT duty of care.'

Ms Birtles-Eades went on to say that the man should have been sedated and put in a psychiatric ward if that was what he needed, but that 'tossing him outside wearing only a hospital gown and a nappy' wasn't the answer.  

'I am shocked and horrified with what I just witnessed.'   

 Ms Birtles-Eades recorded part of the ordeal.

Ms Birtles-Eades called an ambulance when she noticed the man had been left outside the hospital

In the footage, the man can be heard moaning and whining as he is forcibly dragged from the premises.  

'You've been discharged – let's go, come on… you're going... off,' one guard says.

The mother-of-three was in the emergency room waiting for her husband to receive treatment for a suspected stroke. 

She was asked to stop filming the incident and was told it was 'illegal', but Ms Birtles-Eades said that was the least of her concerns. 

'The hospital can fix broken bones, but if you've got a broken brain, you're stuffed,' she said.

'How many times does a person have to ask for help before they get it? How bad do you have to be – dead?'

Ms Birtles-Eades called an ambulance when she noticed the man had been left outside the hospital.

The Queensland Ambulance Service transported him right back to the same hospital emergency room. 

A Queensland Health spokesman told the Courier-Mail that staff gave the man a gown as he arrived naked and said that the man's GP was contacted before he was discharged. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Queensland Health for comment.
