Rochester police has announced its first ever female police chief after the departure of its command staff following protests over the death of Daniel Prude.

Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan, a former lieutenant with the Rochester Police Department, was appointed as the interim chief of the addled force Saturday morning.  

Mayor Lovely Warren announced her appointment in an event at City Hall.

This came after Warren dismissed former chief Le'Ron Singletary last week after he and several senior members of the force stood down in their masses following a backlash over Prude's killing.

Outrage erupted last month when footage surfaced of black man Prude, who was suffering mental health issues, being suffocated by police officers in the streets of Rochester nearly six months ago.
