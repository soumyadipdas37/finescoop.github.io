Some of New York City's Michelin star restaurants are crying out for an update from the city on whether or not they'll be able to resume indoor dining in the fall, and say that without it, they will have to close their doors. 

Restaurants and bars were finally able to offer outdoor dining again on June 22 after nearly three months of closures.

Those who were able to opened their doors again but were met with strict rules; all diners must be 6ft apart, wear masks when not at their tables and they must order food with every drink served. 

Now, as summer winds down and cooler temperatures set in, there are fears over how they will continue to cling on through the fall.

The outdoor dining scheme ends on October 31 and so far, Bill de Blasio has put forward no plans to allow people back inside restaurants. 

It has left the surviving restaurants 'flying blind'. 'If we don’t open inside, it’s going to be a disaster,' said Daniel Boulud, of the famous Daniel on 65th St, told The Wall Street Journal.

Marea in Midtown is among restaurants that has offered upscale, outdoor dining 

Carbone, in the heart of Greenwich Village, has also been welcoming diners since outdoor dining began



Many say they would rather know now if they won't be able to open in the fall to begin negotiations with landlords. 

Daniel Boulud, of the famed Daniel restaurant, said it will be a 'disaster' if he cannot let diners back indoors 

'Dr. Autumn is knocking on the door in a big way,' Danny Meyer, of Union Square Hospitality Group, said. 

He added that the lack of information from de Blasio and Cuomo was making it 'impossible to have rational conversations.

'We are now flying blindly,' Blair Papagni, who owns Anella in Greenpoint and Jimmy's Diner, added. 

More than 1,000 restaurants across New York City have already been forced to close due to the pandemic. 

It remains unclear how many will be able to reopen when it it safe to welcome diners back inside.

Some do not have the capacity for outdoor dining, and for others, it is not worth it financially. 

Despite the increasing pressure on the industry and growing frustration among restaurant owners, there is still no information coming from the government. 

Other states including Rhode Island and Massachusetts have resumed indoor dining. 

Some parts of upstate New York have also allowed indoor dining to resume but New York City remains under a strict ban. 

More than 300 restaurants have sued the city over the ban. They are seeking $2billion in damages in a class action lawsuit. 

De Blasio signaled on Monday that indoor dining may still be months away from returning despite NYC recording a 0.59 percent COVID-19 infection rate - one of the lowest rates since March.

The dire outlook for already struggling restaurants came as reports emerged that de Blasio has delayed laying off 22,000 city workers in the hopes that the state government will provide funding.

'We do expect - and pray for and expect - a vaccine in the spring that will allow us to get more back to normal,' de Blasio said.

'But I will absolutely tell you, we're going to keep looking for that situation where we can push down the virus enough where we would have more ability to address indoor dining.

De Blasio, who is considering whether to extend outdoor dining beyond the October 31 expiry date, went on to say that he hoped to have more information in the coming days about the return indoor dining.

'Is there a way where we can do something safely with indoor dining? So far we have not had that moment, honestly,' he said.

'It would take a huge step forward to get to that point and that's the truth.'

Andrew Rigie, of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, questioned de Blasio's suggestion that the city hadn't worked out how to safely allow indoor dining.

'With indoor dining resuming soon in New Jersey, New York City will be surrounded by indoor dining but locked out from participating at significant economic peril,' he said.

'The situation is at a boiling point and our government leaders must immediately develop a plan to reopen indoor dining across the five boroughs, like what's been provided to restaurants throughout the rest of the state.

'Otherwise, our city's economic crisis will reach a point it cannot come back from, with thousands of more restaurants permanently closing and likely more lawsuits filed against the government.

'The rest of New York State has been operating for months now at 50 percent reduced indoor occupancy using the same requirements that NYC was going to use starting July 6, until it was put on hold indefinitely.'

It comes as New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said that restaurants will be allowed to reopen for indoor dining on Friday.

The number of diners must be limited to 25 percent of the restaurant's capacity and tables must be spaced in accordance with social-distancing rules.

Masks will have to be worn except when eating or drinking.

The announcement comes five months after the state shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Like neighboring New York City, restaurants and bars have only been allowed to offer outdoor seating after they could reopen in June.

Indoor dining has been prohibited in both New Jersey and New York since the coronavirus pandemic erupted in March.

Restaurants outside of NYC in other parts of the state have already been allowed to welcome back indoor diners.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday acknowledged the 'competitive disadvantage' New York City restaurants were going to face given New Jersey's loosened restrictions.

Meanwhile, de Blasio is delaying potential layoffs for 22,000 city workers in the hope that the state government will provide funding.

Those city workers were expected to be notified on Monday if they would still have jobs come October 1 after de Blasio announced the potential layoffs in June.
