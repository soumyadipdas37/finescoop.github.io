New government guidelines recently increased the number of places Britons need to wear a face mask. 

And Lottie Moss came up with a novel way to ensure she didn't forget hers, as she sported a face mask dress on her stroll around London on Thursday. 

In a sensible yet stylish move, the 22-year-old model ensured she kept covered up in the one-piece by PrettyLittleThing.

As well as covering her nose and mouth, the garment skimmed over her lithe figure, showcasing her tiny waist.

Putting her toned pins on display, Lottie went bare legged, slipping her feet into chunky black boots. 

The model, who is the younger half sister of Kate Moss, completed the look by styling her glossy golden locks in high bunches.

Lottie was flying solo on the outing, but she has been linked to a string of men in recent weeks.  

Earlier this month, Lottie was seen putting on a cosy display with a mystery hunk following a lavish meal with friends in London. 

Elsewhere, she fuelled dating speculation as she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during a recent holiday. 

In videos and pictures shared to Instagram, Chris, 27, can be seen putting on a cosy display with the blonde, and even proceeds to drape his leg over her.

Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April.  

Lottie was also linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host. 

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury. 

A mutual friend told The Sun on Sunday: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.

'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'
