A mum of three has appeared in court accused of attempting to murder her husband as their son is also charged with assisting an offender.

Kevin Singleton was found with head and stab wounds at the family home near Scunthorpe on Monday afternoon.

Wife Joanne Singleton, 48, has been charged with attempted murder, and their son Fox Singleton, is accused of assisting an offender. 

They appeared before the court separately. The couple also have two daughters.

Prosecutor, Angela Finnan said paramedics from East Midlands Ambulance Service found Mr Singleton with 'a substantial head injury' and 'a number of puncture wounds,' including a punctured lung. EMAS had been alerted at 1.51pm.

The prosecutor described them as 'life-threatening injuries,' and added that the victim remains in traumatic care in hospital, but did not state which hospital.

Barrister Ian Haywood, on behalf of Joanne Singleton, confirmed CSI officers had been at the home since Monday and were due to complete their forensic examination of the scene by late yesterday.

District Judge Daniel Curtis said the offence was 'one of the gravest of offences that comes through this court.'

He rejected an application for bail and remanded Mrs Singleton to custody to reappear at Hull Crown Court on October 9.
