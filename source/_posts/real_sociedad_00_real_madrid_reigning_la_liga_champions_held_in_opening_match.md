David Silva and Martin Odegaard both made their debuts but Real Madrid and Real Sociedad couldn’t break each other down as they shared the points at the Reale Arena on Sunday night.

After 10 years at Manchester City, Silva’s much anticipated return to La Liga finally happened on minute 63 minutes but the magician couldn’t put his spell on a tight game in which chances were scarce throughout.

In their first match post-Gareth Bale, Real Madrid started with the young Brazilians Rodrigo and Vinicius playing either side of Karim Benzema and they lacked the cutting edge in attack.





Sergio Ramos had claims for a penalty turned down when his shot inside the area hit Aihen Munoz first on the hip and then on the arm.

Despite being second best in the first half Real Sociedad had the best chance of the game late in the first period when Isak’s shot was well saved by Thibaut Courtois’ outstretched right leg.

Ander Barrenetxea sent a volley just wide in the second half as Real Sociedad improved but without managing to find the finishing touch.







Real Madrid gave debuts to 20-year-old winger Marvin Olawale and to 18-year-old attacking midfielder Sergio Arribas but Real Sociedad held out.

Alex Remiro got down well to his left to make a late save from Karim Benzema with the visitor’s last attack but defeat would have been hard on the home team.

Zinedine Zidane said: ‘We played well, especially in the first half. It was tougher in the second half and it’s true that we didn’t create that many chances.

‘We have to look for solutions and find the gaps in games like this. Odegaard was good tonight. It’s his first game back and bit by bit he will get better.’

Host commentator

The referee blows his whistle for full time. The reigning Spanish champions drop points in their first game of the 2020-21 season. 

Zidane's side created little in that second half and the hosts might have won the game when Barrenetxea's volley drifted narrowly wide. 

However. Benzema will rue the glaring opportunity he missed in the first half after showing quick feet to round Remiro.

Real Madrid return to action when they travel to Real Betis on Saturday, while Real Sociedad face Elche.

Another change for the hosts. Guevara goes off and makes way for Gonzalez.

Meanwhile, Arribas replaces Vinicius Jr for Real Madrid.

David Silva might have made it a dream debut there but for Raphael Varane. The attacking midfielder receives the ball from Januzaj on the edge of the box, and his rasping strike flattens Raphael who blocks bravely. 

The French defender consequently receives treatment on the floor.

Carvajal is shown a yellow card after cynically taking down Merino.

Ferland Mendy is sandwiched by home defenders as he breaks into the area, but the referee waves away penalty claims and awards a free-kick to the home side.

Imanol Algaucil opts to make two changes. 

Januzaj and Bautista come on for Oyarzabal and Barrenetxea.

Kroos forces Remiro into another fairly comfortable stop. Madrid are moving through the gears but Zidane decides to make three changes. 

Odegaard, Rodrygo and Modric are replaced with Casemiro, Valverde and Marvin.

David Silva makes his Real Sociedad debut, replacing Isak. 

The Spaniard is introduced moments after Benzema forced Remiro into a routine low save.

Carvajal unleashes a fierce shot from range. Alex Remiro fumbles but gathers at the second attempt before throwing the ball out to start a counter attack.

David Silva is out warming up on the touchline. The former Manchester City man could make his first Real Sociedad appearance in this second half.

Odegaard races through midfield and picks up on Benzema's intelligent run, playing an incisive pass into his path. The forward shoots low but his effort is blocked by Elustondo.

The hosts go close once again, starting the second half as they finished the first. Oyarzabal chips a delightful ball into the path of Barrenetxea who volleys inches wide of Courtois' far post.

Real Madrid get us back underway at Reale Arena.

Referee Juan Martinez Manuera blows his whistle to end the first half.

Real Madrid dominated the half without frequently breaking through the home defence. Sociedad arguably had the best opportunity of the half when Isak was denied by Courtois.

Isak races through after Sociedad pinch the ball in midfied. The home forward tries to slot into the bottom corner but his shot is blocked by Courtois' outstretched left leg. Fine save by the ex-Chelsea goalkeeper.

What a chance! Benzema presses Alex Remiro into a mistake and swiftly picks up the ball in front of goal. The Frenchman rounds the home goalkeeper but inexplicably fires wide from six yards.

From the following phase, Real Madrid cultivate another opportunity and Benzema slips before firing wide from the edge of the area.

Real Madrid are getting closer now. Kroos' corner kick causes havoc in the Real Sociedad penalty area and results in Ramos volleying towards goal. Munoz throws himself at the ball and blocks bravely.

Munoz becomes the latest player to enter the book after tussling with Rodrygo. Kroos' subsequent set piece is headed away.

Mendy is taken out by Gorosabel in the penalty area but the home defender gets a vital touch to put the ball behind for yet another Madrid corner.

In the ensuing phase of play, Mendy is shown a yellow card for a bad foul.

Barrenetxea is shown a yellow card for blocking Carvajal. 

The Real Sociedad man made the foul in frustration seconds after he was unable to reach Merino's probing pass.

Kroos whips in another corner but Real Sociedad are awarded a free-kick after Sergio Ramos commits a foul in the penalty area.

Ferland Mendy sends a low cross into the box and Elustondo clears behind. 

Toni Kroos wedges the corner to Luka Modric on the edge of the area but his volley is blocked.

Benzema goes for goal from 25 yards after an intricate passing move but his tame shot is comfortably fielded by home goalkeeper Alex Remiro.

Vinicius pulls off an outrageous nutmeg on Elustondo and the Sociedad defender pulls his opponent to the ground in frustration. 

Toni Kroos swings the resulting free-kick into the box but it gets headed clear.

Benzema goes to ground after an aerial collision with Elustondo. The pair get back to their feet and are now ready to continue.

Odegaard has been heavily involved in the opening stages. Real Madrid have looked to play on the counter attack and use the pace of Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo.

Real Sociedad get us underway here at Reale Arena.

Real Sociedad have won two of their last four meetings with Real Madrid, but Zinedine Zidane's men ran out 2-1 victors last time the sides met. 

Los Blancos won nine of their final 10 league matches after lockdown, and the June victory in San Sebastian helped them on their way to securing the title.

Sergio Ramos and Karim Benzema found the net before Mikel Merino pulled a goal back in the closing stages.

The champions have arrived and are warming up ahead of their first competitive match of the 2020-21 season.
