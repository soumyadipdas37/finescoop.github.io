There are just eight contestants left vying for Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor.

And on Wednesday, rumoured finalists Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis posted some very telling cocktail party photos ahead of tonight's rose ceremony.

Nurse Irena, 31, posted a snap of herself in a sparkly blazer dress accompanied by a cheeky caption that suggested she and Locky are still very close.

'Stole this from Locky’s wardrobe. We are back tonight at 7:30,' she captioned the post, followed by a monkey emoji. 

Meanwhile, marketing consultant Bella, 25, posted a picture of herself in a pink zebra print dress accompanied by a rather flat caption. 

'Emotions are running high tonight. Tune in at 7:30pm as we reach the tail end of this crazy journey,' she wrote. 

End of the road? Bella (pictured) said 'emotions are running high' in tonight's episode and that she was reaching 'the tail end of this crazy journey'

Bella's reference to 'the tail end of the journey' seems to suggest that her relationship with Locky will end once The Bachelor finishes. 

It is rumoured that Bella and Irena will be the final two contestants who Locky has to choose between. 

The marketing consultant is set to confront Locky about Irena on Wednesday night's episode, which actually seems to play in Irena's favour.

'I decided to say something to Locky because it seems like she's getting into his head,' Bella said in a promo. 

But Locky was having none of it, saying:  'I am actually pretty pretty upset, I have seen a side of Bella I didn't think I would see'.  

The Bachelor is then shown insisting they go back to the party, while Bella tries to make him stay with her.

'I really hope it's not too late,' a distressed Bella says at the end of the clip.
