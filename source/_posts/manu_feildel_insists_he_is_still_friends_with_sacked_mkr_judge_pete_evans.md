Manu Feildel has insisted he's very much 'still friends' with his former My Kitchen Rules star Pete Evans.

On Tuesday, the 46-year-old spoke out to New Idea about his relationship with anti-vaxxer Pete - whose controversial opinion on health topics has been deemed dangerous in recent months.

But despite claims that Manu has turned his back on Pete, the Plate of Origin star has now said that 'nothing has changed' between the two.

'I’ve caught up with Peter last week. We’re still friends, we’ve been friends for a long time so nothing’s changed.'

When asked if he found it difficult to see his friend face backlash, he responded: 'He doesn’t look at it as backlash, he looks at it as publicity.

'He gets his message across and people like it, people don’t and you know, it is what it is.'

Divisive: Evans has been involved in a string of controversies since being sacked by Seven earlier this year for his extreme views. In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale' 

He went on to say that his friend is 'fine' and that he's simply getting on with his life.

October 2014: Evans claims the Paleo diet can prevent autism

March 2015: His book is pulled from shelves due to its bone broth recipe for infants

July 2016: Evans claims vegan women should eat meat during pregnancy, advises against wearing 'normal' sunscreen, and claims Wi-Fi is 'dangerous'

August 2016: He says osteoporosis suffers shouldn't eat dairy

September 2016: Evans claims camel milk could supplement breastfeeding

April 2017: Evans campaigns against the 'mass fluoridation of public water'

December 2018: Evans reveals he looks directly into the sun

April 2020: Evans' ketogenic recipe book is slammed by health professionals and he is fined for promoting his 'healing lamp'

Among his false claims about the pandemic, Pete has previously declared he's immune to coronavirus, and blamed the health crisis on 5G technology.

Trump supporter Evans' central belief is that 'food is medicine' and that by following a Paleo diet, people can develop superhuman immune systems that can withstand all illnesses, including COVID-19.

There is absolutely no scientific basis for this. Following a particular diet does not make a person any less likely to contract the deadly respiratory virus.
