Coles chief executive of commercial and express Greg Davis said Coles is committed to offer great value on products customers buy most.

'We've been reviewing the products our customers are buying every day and determining where we can really make a difference to the family budget during what has been a very challenging time for so many Australians,' he said.

'In the last year alone, we have saved our customers millions of dollars on chicken products alone including chicken thighs, drumsticks and whole chooks.'

The savings come as the supermarket drops the prices of popular items across its aisles to celebrate its tenth year of 'Down Down' and the 'Big Red Hand' providing Australians with trusted value they can rely on every time they shop.

Down Down has been a key part of chain's commitment to delivering great value to customers. Over the 10 years to the end of June, Coles have delivered an estimated cumulative price deflation of 10 per cent.

The supermarket has delivered millions of dollars in savings across the store through trusted value initiatives including the addition of 326 further products to the Down Down program.
