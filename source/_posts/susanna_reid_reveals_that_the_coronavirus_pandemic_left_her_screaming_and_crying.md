Susanna Reid has disclosed that the coronavirus pandemic gave her crippling nightmares where she would wake up 'screaming and crying'. 

The Good Morning Britain host, 49, discussed her anxiety struggles which surfaced at the start of the pandemic in March, and how she has found the whole experience 'very frightening'.    

During an interview with The Telegraphs’ Stella Magazine, Susanna explained: 'It was an anxious time for everybody, but those early days were very frightening.

Scary: Susanna Reid disclosed that the coronavirus pandemic gave her crippling nightmares where she would wake up 'screaming and crying'

'I started to have really vivid, terrifying nightmares where I would wake up screaming and crying even though I couldn’t quite remember what the nightmares were.'

The GMB presenter- who hosts the ITV show alongside Piers Morgan- felt her fears reached new heights after learning that her co-star, Kate Garraway's husband was sent to intensive care after contracting the virus.   

Derek was rushed to hospital in March and was placed into an medically-induced coma to aid his recovery.

He is now out of his coma, but remains in hospital and has dropped a whopping eight stone over the past six months due to his illness.

The former lobbyist is unable to speak, so Susanna has taken it upon herself to support her colleague throughout the challenging period. 

She has been doing what she can to assist Kate, 53, and her children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14, as they return to school. 

After her husband was hospitalised, Kate decided to take some time off to support her family, but she announced her return to Smooth Radio earlier this month so Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love,'.

In a moving interview in Saturday's You magazine, the mother-of-two said: 'We hope and believe he will come out of it but we just don't know. 

'The heart of the family has been ripped out and we don't know if we will ever get it back.'
