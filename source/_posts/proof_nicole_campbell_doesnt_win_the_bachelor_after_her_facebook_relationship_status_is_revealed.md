She's still in the running to win Locky Gilbert's heart, but it looks like Nicole Campbell doesn't go all the way on The Bachelor.

In a screenshot taken from her Facebook page on July 30, the 26-year-old still listed her relationship status as 'single'.

Filming on the hit reality dating series was postponed at the end of March, just three weeks into production amid the coronavirus pandemic, but resumed in early July.

On Wednesday, Nicole was still one of 15 girls left in the competition after the series started out with 24 potential suitors.

She caught Locky's eye early on in the show, arriving to meet him for the first time in an elaborate dance costume.

Shortly after their initial meeting, the 31-year-old Bachelor gifted Nicole with a 'triple threat rose'.

The highly sought after rose entitled her to a single date, a spot in a group date and an invitation for exclusive one-on-one time with Locky.

'You came out, amazing,' he began, before adding, 'You taught me how to dance - I didn't think I was gonna do that.' 

He then went on to praise the vivacious blonde's bubbly energy.

'Every time I was walking around, you were always the life of the party, and that's amazing to me,' he explained, before handing her the coveted rose. 

 'I said before this all started, if a girl jumps into my arms, that's gonna be a winner for me.' 

But while she may have been an early favourite, her relationship status suggests she doesn't walk away with the ultimate prize.
