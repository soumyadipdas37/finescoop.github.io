A mother-of-two who has gone from a size 18 to a size 10 after losing an impressive four stone in lockdown is now desperate to remove a flap of excess skin on her tummy.

Laura Painter, 27, from Enfield, north London, said she feels the healthiest she's ever been but the folds of skin across her tummy 'get her down' - and she believes it will cost around £8,000 to get rid.

She has started saving up, but is currently unable to do her job - manager of a betting shop - due to the pandemic, so has launched a GoFundMe page to help her raise funds.

Laura said: 'I started saving 2 weeks ago and I'm at £60 currently! I want to have a tummy tuck and have this skin removed so that my quality of life can be better.

Laura, who has always struggled with her weight, said she feels the healthiest she's ever been

Despite feeling proud of herself and her body, Laura admitted the folds of excess skin on her tummy 'get her down'

'I know not everyone will agree with this but I’m only asking for help for some of it as I want to pay for it myself but it’s not possible as of now.'

Laura, who has two daughters aged five and one, tipped the scales at 15st 7lb before the onset of Covid-19. 

'I’ve struggled with my weight from a young age,' she said. 'My weight has gone up and gone down so much over the years..

'Having children can be such a strain on our bodies; two babies down and it’s safe to say my stomach is in need of a hand.'

Laura said: 'I'll always love my Playdoh belly, but I'd prefer a flat one. But I'm not going to hate myself because it isn't flat'

When lockdown hit in March, Laura took up fitness, starting with going jogging and moving onto home workouts. 

She gradually incorporated both into her weekly routine, and is now the lightest she's ever been at 11st 8lb and a trim size 10-12.

'I'm happier and healthier then I've ever been in my adult life,' Laura admitted.

Speaking about the excess skin that now rests on her tummy, she added: 'It brings me down and just makes me feel sad - but at the same time proud and grateful for what I’ve been able to achieve in such a short amount of time. 

'I'll always love my Playdoh belly, but I'd prefer a flat one. But I'm not going to hate myself because it isn't flat.'

After looking into excess skin removal surgery, which she said costs in the region of £8,000 in the UK, Laura began saving two weeks ago.

'I'm at £60 currently!' she said. 'My youngest is only one and not in childcare yet as I’m unable to go to work at the moment.

After looking into excess skin removal surgery, which she said costs in the region of £8,000 in the UK, Laura began saving for hers two weeks ago and launched a fundraising page

'When she's two I’ll be back to work hopefully and able to save more than I have been able to at home.'

Her fundraising target is £2,000, with Laura hoping to pay for the rest of it herself. She has so far received £150 in donations.  

Laura said any donations would be 'so great', adding: 'Please don’t feel forced, but a helping hand never hurt anyone, just helped them.'
