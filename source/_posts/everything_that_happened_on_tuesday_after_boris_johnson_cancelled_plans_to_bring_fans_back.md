Hopes that football grounds will see the return of fans were dashed after Boris Johnson's announcement on Tuesday.

Trial events scheduled for October have been delayed due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, meaning supporters could be stopped from attending matches at stadiums until 2021. 

With many fans still holding questions about the Government's announcement, Sportsmail's Mike Keegan explains everything that happened on Tuesday and how the world of football reacted.

What exactly did the prime minister say?

‘We have to acknowledge the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen large sporting events, so we will not be able to do this from October 1. 

I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities. The Chancellor and Culture Secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them.’

What does this mean?

In the short term, it means none of the proposed trials to bring fans back will happen. The picture for the longer term is unclear, given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. Overall, though, Tuesday's announcement was disastrous for sport.

I can go to a pub and sit with other groups of people. Why can’t I go to a stadium with a reduced capacity?

The issue with attending sporting events, the Government believes, is not the game itself but the whole experience, from leaving your house to returning. That includes your journey to and from the venue, queueing at the turnstile, the walk to your seat (or terrace) and any interactions while there — including visiting the bar or bathroom.

For which clubs is it especially bad news?

Some will feel the impact more than others but the equation is simple: those who rely on gate receipts to make up a large share of their revenue will be hardest hit. Thanks to the size of TV deals and the vast commercial riches on offer, the Premier League will not feel the impact as much as those lower down the pecking order.

For clubs lower down, it will hit hard. The EFL estimate combined losses of £200million if there are no fans in grounds this season, which will take some absorbing.

It has long been feared that the pandemic will send some historic outfits out of business. This news will push some closer to the brink. Other sports — whose clubs rely on gate receipts — will also be reeling. The RFU is braced for a £50m loss in revenue. No crowds at the autumn internationals will be a savage blow across the sport. Premiership clubs have warned some will go bust by Christmas without crowds. Rugby league — already in debt to the Government — will suffer, given its reliance on gate receipts. Horse racing will also feel the pinch with no punters at the track.

Any good news?

Mr Johnson disclosed the Chancellor and Culture Secretary would be looking at what they can do to support at-risk clubs. 

With regards to professional men’s football, the Premier League will be urged to agree a bailout loan with the EFL. Support packages for other clubs in other sports will be discussed.

Back to square one?

Pretty much. Some trials have been held and their results will be stored. But common sense suggests the return of fans is as far away as it has been since sport went behind closed doors, now winter is around the corner and the virus is on the march again.

What happens next?

Mr Johnson said these restrictions would stay in place for six months unless ‘palpable’ progress is made. 

In other words, fans are not coming back any time soon. That means those already in a perilous financial position need support. If not, they — notwithstanding decades of heritage and history — will vanish.

... AND HOW THE WORLD OF FOOTBALL REACTED

JOEY BARTON (Fleetwood manager)

There is an Armageddon about to happen here. We have seen Macclesfield go, Bury went last year and we have seen Wigan in a tight spot.

There are going to be a lot of clubs that, if we don’t have fans back, are going to be severely hampered if not forced to the wall. Our club is at the centre of the community.

You have people who have worked tirelessly with no financial reward because they care deeply. People are getting discarded and made redundant and clubs are being closed. That is just wrong.

Sean Dyche (Burnley manager)

If the Premier League can do their bit to enhance the chances of others surviving, possibly they’ll step in.

But if you’re going to apply that rule of thumb, does that mean every incredibly successful hedge-fund manager is going to filter it down to those not so successful? Are the restaurants and bars going to filter it down? You can’t just measure football on its own. If you apply it to football, you have to apply it across the country.

Liam Scully (Lincoln City chief executive)

It's one of the biggest games in the club’s history (hosting Liverpool in the Carabao Cup tomorrow), and not to have fans is desperately disappointing.

I fear there are going to be casualties. As current custodians of the football clubs, we’re all petrified.

Nicola Palios (Tranmere Rovers vice-chairman)

A lot of clubs were already having financial difficulties before this pandemic and sadly this may tip some of them over the edge. If a rescue fund isn’t forthcoming, you’ll see a devastating impact in terms of loss of clubs and jobs.

Robbie Cowling (Colchester United owner)

There seems to be a parallel universe where Tottenham sign a player on loan (Gareth Bale) who is paid more in a week than it would take to keep Macclesfield alive. Communities are losing their clubs. It’s devastating.
