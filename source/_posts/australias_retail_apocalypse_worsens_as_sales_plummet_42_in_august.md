Hundreds of stores are shutting down as Australians spent $1.2 billion less on retail last month amid the COVID-19 recession. 

Retail spending dropped by 4.2 per cent nationally from July to August, according to preliminary trade figures released by the ABS on Wednesday.

Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown and Stage Three restrictions in regional Victoria saw retail trade in the state drop by 12.6 per cent, dragging down the national figure.

Excluding Victoria, the rest of Australia fell 1.5 per cent from July to August.

Household goods, clothing footwear and personal accessory retailing, department stores, and cafés, restaurants and takeaway food services, also saw large monthly falls, with the largest drop in Victoria. 

Meanwhile, NSW saw a large decrease in spending at cafés, restaurants and takeaway food services. 

With many businesses now laying off staff, payroll jobs decreased by 4.5 per cent and total wages decreased by 4.3 per cent from March 7 to September 5.  

As a result of the retail apocalypse, David Jones announced it would be cutting 20 per cent of it floor space 'including closing stores where this makes sense'.

Given there are 47 David Jones stores in Australia and New Zealand, this means that nine to ten shops could be closed.

The first store to shut down is one of two nearby David Jones branches on Bourke Street in the Melbourne CBD. 

The smaller 'men's store' was sold in July for $121 million and will be absorbed into the larger 'women's store' across the road, along with the food hall.

David Jones is now leasing back the men's premises during the transition.

Earlier this month, Australian fashion label Colette by Colette Hayman announced it would be closing more than 100 stores to save the business.

Fashion retailer Mosaic Brands revealed it will close up to 500 stores across Australia after being 'utterly derailed' by the COVID-19 pandemic late last month. 

Noni B, Rivers, Millers and Katie are some of the popular outlets that will be affected by the closures. 

In May, 167 Target stores closed down for good after feeling the bite of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Parent company Wesfarmers completely shut down 75 of the stores while 92 were converted into Kmarts, as it was found to be more profitable.
