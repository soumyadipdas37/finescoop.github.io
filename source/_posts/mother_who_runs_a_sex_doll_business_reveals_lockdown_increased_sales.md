A businesswoman who sells sex dolls has revealed how her company has been thriving throughout the pandemic, and that she's noticed an increase in sales each time a new lockdown restriction comes into place.  

Jade Stanley, 36, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, launched her company Sex Doll Official in 2018, and sells and rents plastic sex companions, some of which can cost up to £8,000, to 'lonely' customers. 

The mother-of-four explained that due to widespread isolation during the coronavirus crisis, she saw surges in sales every time there was a change in lockdown rules, insisting customers want 'more than just a sex toy'. 

Appearing on This Morning, she also revealed that she's noticed a much bigger demand for male and transgender sex dolls, and told there's a 'big market' for couples who want to involve a 'safe third party' in the bedroom.

'We tailor for anyone', said Jade, 'no age is a barrier, male or female, there is a wide span of our customer range. During lockdown we had a surge because of isolation issues surrounding people, young old, anybody.

'Every time a restriction would come into place, I would see surges and these dolls are very much companion dolls, when people come to my website they’re looking for more than just a sex toy. 

'This is a companion, this is someone to sit in your home and bring a lot of happiness into people’s lives'. 

'You've seen an increase in sales of male dolls haven't you' , asked host Holly Willoughby.

Jade's sex dolls can cost up to £8,000 and can be equipped with AI and respond to the stimuli sent by their users. They can talk, move and act on the fantasies of their owners

'I have', she replied, 'A really large increase in male dolls, there’s a really big market, and transexual dolls as well. 

'Couples, the safe threesome. I’m actually in the process of setting up a pop up shop, because couple’s usually want to view the doll before they purchase.' 

The businesswoman appeared alongside one of her male sex dolls called Jessie even treated hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield to a look at another one of her dolls she's sent to the studio.

Jade, who has been married to husband Elliot for 14 years and has four children, explained that many of her customers view their dolls as a 'presence' in the same way as they would their pet.

'There are a lot of people out there who see a doll as a presence', she told, 'Like having a dog or cat in your home, they do warm up we can put voice boxes in which is quite a big request.'

She explained that some customers buy their dolls simply so they can prop it up in a chair, or pose it lying in their bed.  

'It is the fact I have customers who buy dolls to just sit in the chair or lie in a bed and that, unfortunately, does take the place of a real person, said Jade. 

Jade's most expensive dolls cost up to £8,000, but customers are able to design their companion in any way they want

'Social media has made people interactive online but not outside, this is a really Covid safe way of having psychical interaction with someone'.

'You make the doll completely bespoke to your liking', Jade explained, 'You choose everything, the dimensions of the doll you’d have, the hair implanted which looks better, you choose every aspect of that doll. 

'That again has brought a lot of comfort to people, if that’s what people want to do who are we to judge?'
