Usually you turn the page each month to see a new idyllic landscape or picture of a fluffy kitten. 

But how would you feel about a calendar full of ... car parks? 

For Kevin Beresford, it's a dream come true. The amateur photographer, who describes himself as Britain's dullest man, has spent the past ten years visiting car parks across the country, from multistoreys to wasteland pay and displays.

The 63-year-old from Redditch, Worcestershire, is the founder of The Car Park Appreciation Society – and is the only member so far. 

His hobby doesn't come cheap as he has racked up almost £3,000 in parking charges alone visiting locations up and down the country. 

Mr Beresford said: 'What I enjoy about them is the architecture, like any other building I can appreciate them for how they are built and why.

'The structure of them varies and no two car parks are the same, which keeps it interesting. I've been taking pictures of hundreds of car parks all over the UK and with those images I made a car park calendar and even wrote a book about them.' 

Asked if any car parks in particular stand out, Mr Beresford said: 'My favourite one is demolished now. It was the car park that was used in the Michael Caine movie Get Carter in Gateshead.' 

The Trinity Square car park featured prominently in the 1971 film. It was demolished in 2010.

Admitting, 'I'm the dullest man in Great Britain, and possibly the world,' Mr Beresford said: 'I found that a lot of artists do quite mundane things like Andy Warhol's [Campbell's] Soup Cans.' 

He added: 'I started The Car Park Appreciation Society but unfortunately nobody has joined yet so I'm looking for new members who can send me pictures of the car parks they come across.'

He said: 'I made a roundabout calendar and it just took off, we couldn't make them quick enough to keep up with orders.' 

He also created a calendar featuring old Welsh postboxes.
