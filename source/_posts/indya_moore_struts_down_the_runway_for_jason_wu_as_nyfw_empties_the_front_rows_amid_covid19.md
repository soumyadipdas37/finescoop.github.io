Moore - who uses they/them pronouns - wowed in the unique garment, which was a sleeveless design that featured a ruched neckline and a flattering cinched waist.

The scalloped hem of their dress was decked out in eyelet detailing that coordinated with the more intricate eyelet details above it. 

Indya slipped their feet into a pair of sandals with white and maroon striped straps and vibrant pieces of fabric that dragged on the floor as they walked.

The Queen And Slim star showcased their natural curls and looked to be wearing little to no makeup, which allowed their jewelry to pull focus.

Indya had on a pair of gold hoops that were decked out in beads that coordinated with the beaded choker around their neck. 

In order to adhere to COVID-19 related precautions, NYFW is operating without their famous front row this season. 

Press and photographers were seen wearing masks as they captured each model during Sunday's show.

Vibrant: Wu's Spring 2021 collection consisted of bright, bold colored and vacation-ready silhouettes, inspired by the designer's 'home away from home' Tulum, Mexico

A reminder: 'I wanted to create a collection that reminds me of the bright, tropical hues that recall so many happy memories,' explained Jason in a letter passed out to attendees at the show

'I wanted to create a collection that reminds me of the bright, tropical hues that recall so many happy memories,' explained Jason in a letter passed out to attendees at the show.

As for the collection's theme, he hoped to create a sense of 'escapism' with each ensemble 'because fashion should inspire and make us feel happy.'

Casual side: He added that, with this collection, he was able to explore 'the more casual side of the Jason Wu woman'

Jason's vision was clear as models strutted down the catwalk in various resort wear worthy of a tropical getaway.

In traditional fashion show style, Wu had his own moment on the picturesque runway.

A good cause: Wu wore a face mask that had the phrase 'Distance Yourself From Hate' written on it, which happens to be the name of a new campaign he started in collaboration with GMNC and The Collective Shift

The 37-year-old Taiwanese-Canadian designer had on a plain black tee and a pair of black jeans.

Wu also wore a face mask that had the phrase 'Distance Yourself From Hate' written on it, which happens to be the name of a new campaign he started in collaboration with GMNC and The Collective Shift.

According to Jason, 'the sales of the masks' produced by the campaign will 'help provide food and protective masks to underprivileged communities.'
