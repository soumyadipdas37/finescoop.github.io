It was a day that began like most for morning radio host Travis Winks  - he swatted at his 3am alarm and dragged himself to work, unaware his life was about to change forever.

For three hours he entertained Wollongong breakfast listeners alongside Mel Greig before going home to nap, watch TV, and wait for his wife Amanda to get home.

But that Monday in 2016 began a 67-day period in which his father was shot dead by police, his sister found herself behind bars, and his brother almost died in a suicide attempt.

The shocking series of events ripped apart his close-knit family-of-six and left those who survived still wracked by guilt and anger.

Travis still has to fight back tears at the thought of his dad Russell Winks, 65, never getting to see his 10 grandchildren grow up.

'This 67-day period in my family's life is burned into my brain… I just wish I could talk to my father one more time,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He kept his pain under wraps until his brother Trent tried again to take his own life two years later in July 2018; this time successfully.

Angry and devastated, he began writing that very night, and this month releases his book Shattered.

No family is perfect

Travis grew up in a typical Australian family in southeast Queensland, the youngest of four siblings to hardworking parents Russell and Joy Winks.

His sister Amy was the eldest followed by brother Trent and another sister, Emma, a few years younger, and despite the usual sibling rivalry were close growing up.

'Trent would have the s**ts with me for being an annoying little brother, or with Amy for being a diva, or Amy with Emma for stealing her clothes,' he recalled. 

Travis remembers their annual post-Christmas trips to Coolangatta as great times running around, going to the beach, and playing video games at the club while mum and dad had a drink.

He and Trent went to the same high school as their father - four years apart - and Mr Winks came to watch their rugby and cricket games.

There were family picnics with extended family on weekends, and backyard football at family friends' houses.

As they grew up, Mr Winks would come out for beers with Trent and Travis' friends when they were old enough, teaching them to 'respect the XXXX Gold'.

Mr Winks wasn't around as much as he'd have liked, working flat out as a successful accountant, while Mrs Winks later became a teacher.

'My parents were extremely hardworking to put food on the table and send us all to private school, mum went back to university,' Travis said.

But part of their drive came from troubled upbringings that never fully left them.

Mr Winks was the youngest of four children, by many years, and was never loved by his father - despite him craving it - hurting him to his core.

'He put on this tough exterior but he was a lot softer inside. You think you can read people, but you can't,' Travis said.

'All he ever wanted was to be loved by his dad, and he wasn't so he gave all his love to us so he wouldn't be like his father.'

Mrs Winks was one of 10 children in rural western Queensland and her mother died in a farming accident when she was just 18.

Mr and Mrs Winks were already dating by then, and essentially became parents to her younger siblings, marrying in December 1971.

By 2016, Mr Winks had earned enough to retire at 55 a decade earlier and their had moved to a big property in Freestone, near Warwick on the NSW border. 

They were part-time parenting their six-year-old granddaughter as Emma, a single mother, travelled frequently for work.

'Dad would get her ready for school and mum made her lunch and he'd drop her off at the bus stop as she loved catching the bus,' Travis said.

'Dad looked at her as a second chance because he missed a lot of things with us because he worked so hard.'

Trent was a excellent salesman, kicking goals as a sales manager for beer giant Lion Nathan and every publican in Brisbane knew and loved him.

But in early 2015 he was made redundant, and his attempt to open a seafood truck with the payout was a disaster.

'He loved that job… losing his career took away his identity,' Travis said.

He spiralled into a an increasingly severe depression and refused help from his family, and his wife and mother of his three young children.

Trent's refusal to accept help and rarely taking his medications rendered him unable to hold down a new job and put his marriage under strain.

By 2016, despite the best efforts of his wife, he had moved out to his parents' unit in Tweed Heads and was in divorce proceedings.

Everyone was on edge, he had disappeared for many days at least once taken off before and threatened to kill himself several times.

On September 12, Mrs Winks became worried that Trent hadn't checked in for a few days and asked a neighbour, who had a key, to check on him.

He found Trent on his bedroom floor at 7.48pm barely alive. He had swallowed all his medications, plus whatever other pills he could find in the flat.

'He popped those tablets like tic tacs. If mum wasn't so adamant to get the neighbour in there, Trent probably would have choked to death on his own vomit,' Travis said.

October 19

Eldest child Amy was a successful businesswoman and real estate agent, but that couldn't stop her from falling in love with the wrong man.

'For every good moment there were a bunch of bad ones,' Travis described the four years of abuse his big sister was put through.

'He was manipulative, possessive, controlling, highly violent and abusive, and always accused her of not being loyal.

'But there were times when he was lovely and that's why she kept going back to him.'

Amy left many times, but was always coaxed back despite Travis telling her she was 'being stupid' and could do far better.

'People in domestic violence relationships are like drug addicts in that they will tell you want you want to hear and then go do something else,' he said.

'She went to the police a few times and no one was interested.'

As Amy was reeling from Trent's suicide attempt, he exploited her vulnerability to convince her to come back to him. 

But, in Travis' words, he 'poked the snake one too many times'. The emotional abuse wore her down and she snapped.

First she sent several threatening text messages, including one of her holding a knife.

Later she went to his house to confront him, but he refused to engage and just yelled abuse at her. 

She responded by repeatedly driving her car into his and decided that wasn't enough so she smashed up some of his friends' cars as well.

'Amy was imploding, she wasn't going to take the hurt and abuse anymore and she was letting it out – but in the wrong way,' Travis said.

At the end of her rampage, Amy also tried to kill herself by ramming her car, which was somehow still barely driveable, into a tree.

She survived the impact and was taken to hospital after staggering out of the wreck, before being arrested days later.

Her catastrophic meltdown earned her 13 criminal charges and she spent 119 days behind bars until she made bail in February 2017.

The charges included stalking, threats of violence with a weapon, breaching a domestic violence order, three counts of dangerous driving, willful damage, and possessing a knife in a public place.

Amy was jailed for two years and six months in the Brisbane District Court on August 24, 2017, and immediately granted parole with time served.

Within two weeks of making bail, with the help of charity Sisters Inside, she had a job and now owns a small fashion business.

'Amy said going to jail was a good thing because it got her away from him for good,' Travis said.

'But she handled it in the worst way possible, which meant she went from being the victim to the offender and he's got off scot-free.'

Though she has stayed out of trouble and made a new life for herself as a business owner, the four years of abuse, and what happened after her arrest, left deep scars.

Travis said she hasn't had another relationship since because she 'thinks she's too broken to find love again', and is racked by guilt over her father's death.

November 17

Travis idolised his father growing up, and even after he moved to the U.S. as a sport reporter for ESPN and then to Wollongong, they talked every other day.

He was proud of how his dad worked so hard and essentially fathered three generations of kids, and now got to enjoy retirement on a farm. 

Before Trent's suicide, Mr Winks appeared to be happy and content, besides some financial stress over building defects in the Tweed Heads unit.

Mr Winks would do anything for his children - determined to show them the love his father never gave him, and protect them form whatever came their way.

But the events of those 67 days left him feeling like everything was spiralling out of control and nothing he was doing could fix it.

'My dad was so focused on helping Trent and then Amy had her breakdown, I think he ran out of answers,' Travis said.

'He was the problem solver, as an accountant, and he couldn't solve the problem. 

'He had so much love for all of us and I think he felt like he was letting us down because he couldn't fix it. 

'Dad was so upset that be made an emotionally-charged decision that could have been prevented that cost him his life.'

Two week before his death, Mr Winks put up his beloved Freestone property to get Amy bail, but the magistrate wouldn't even entertain bail. 

'He was floored that he couldn't get her out and took it really hard,' Travis recalled.

A week later he was taken to hospital with chest pains a blood clot was found in his lung, for which he was prescribed blood thinners.

Test results at the same visit also indicated a possibility that he may have stomach cancer and he was told to get a test for it as soon as possible.

After his death, an examination of his stomach in the post-mortem showed no signs of cancer. 

Travis doesn't believe these health issues were a significant factor in his father's death, but did increase his overall stress.

On the day of his death, Amy called Travis from jail to explain to him how to wire money into her prison account so she could call her parents and buy stamps to mail them letters.

Travis then talked to Mr Winks, who was anxious to get his daughter cash and had failed in his attempt to send some earlier that day.

He told him that he would get her some soon that would tide her over for the next week, and he would call him on the weekend to explain the process.

Travis said this call, the last conversation he ever had with his father, was strange because he was far less chatty than usual.

Usually they would talk about the weather, their shared love of the Brisbane Broncos, how their kids and grandchildren were doing and what sport they were playing, and complain about politics. 

But that day he was very 'closed off', frustrated, and not eager to continue the conversation.

Travis voice cracks as he remembers the last words he spoke to his father at the end of the call.

'Amy had asked me to tell dad she loved him very much as she saw how devastated he was at her court hearing.

'So I told him that, and that I loved him as well. At least I got to say that one last time.'

Mr Winks wasn't content to wait to send Amy money and was only further upset when Emma called to say she was also having problems with the transfer.

'It was clear that during the course of the call Mr Winks became increasingly frustrated with the situation, and the conversation became heated,' inquest findings into Mr Winks' death detailed.

After the call, about 4pm, Mr Winks put on his work boots, grabbed his hat and walked down to the back paddock. 

Mrs Winks called after him and he called back that he was 'going down the back paddock to bash his head against a tree and bleed to death'. 

This was taken as a frustrated quip, that he just needed to go walk it off, but after 10 minutes Mr Winks decided to go after him.

She found him loading a .22 rifle she didn't even know he had, and begged him to put it down and come back to the house.

Travis explained this was a rifle they used to shoot as kids that the family thought he got rid of after the Port Arthur Massacre.

However, actually kept it wrapped in a tarpaulin with spare ammunition and cleaning equipment, hidden under the cover of a water pump of the bore at the back of the house.

Mr Winks told his wife 'I'm done', so she begged him to shoot her first as she didn't want to live without him.

'I'm not going to do that, how about you go back up to the house. I'm done,' he told her.

At this point their granddaughter, Emma's daughter whom Mrs Winks left doing homework, was hysterically yelling 'nanny, poppy, where are you?'

She decided to run back to the house to look after the little girl, and on her way back up the gully heard five shots.

Fearing her husband had just shot himself, but not being able to bear going back to find out, she phoned her neighbours Andrew and Barbara Hardwick.

They drove over right away and Mr Hardwick walked to the gully and came upon Mr Winks, 'agitated and angry', sitting with the rifle in his hands.

Mr Hardwick told him his wife feared he was dead, but Mr Winks walked away further down the gully out of sight.

During this time, Mrs Winks called triple-0 at 4.16pm and police progressively arrived at the property in an attempt to get Mr Winks to drop the gun and go to hospital.

The inquest, held more than two years later in December 2018, recounted the standoff with police that led to Mr Winks being fatally shot.

Senior Constable Jeremy Lambert and Constable Laura Zillman were the first on the scene and starting negotiating with Mr Winks at 4.38pm.

Mr Winks refused to surrender and instead yelled to them that he didn't want to be shot by a pistol and to 'get someone with a rifle'. 

He then walked out of sight down the gully and the officers waited for reinforcements to arrive.

Senior Constable Joseph Cook heard the call on his police radio and grabbed a rifle from the local police station.

He arrived about 5pm as his colleagues were planning to fall back and form a perimeter around the property to negotiate with Mr Winks from afar.

There was just one problem - Mr Hardwick's car was further down the gully and still had its keys in the ignition.

The police plan was to clear out of the property and negotiate with Mr Winks via a mobile phone left at the house.

But if the keys were left in Mr Hardwick's car, Mr Winks could use it to leave the property, so Senior Constable Steven Gibb ran to get them.

As he approached, Mr Winks appeared and SC Cook and three colleagues took cover behind the police car.

'For the sake of thirty seconds or a minute we all would have been gone and we would have safely tactically withdrawn,' SC Gibb later told the inquest of the tragic timing.

Mr Winks addressed SC Cook, who was armed with the rifle, directly - likely in the hope of convincing the officer to shoot him.

'As Mr Winks approached the officers he was asking why they had not come down to the gully, as he was waiting for them,' the inquest findings stated.

SC Cook repeatedly asked him to put down the gun, but he responded by hurling abuse at the officers and shouting 'f**king shoot me'.

The officer promised Mr Winks he would not be handcuffed and arrested, as he feared, just taken to hospital to get help.

'Mr Winks said that the police could not help anyone, and that the way they dealt with his daughter was ridiculous. He said the whole system was s**t,' the inquest finding stated.

The two talked for about four minutes with Mr Winks about 15m away from SC Cook and his colleagues. He told him to drop the gun 25 times.

'Mr Winks remained very agitated. He was continually pacing from side to side, and waving his rifle around, swapping it from hand to hand and sometimes resting it on either shoulder.'

SC Gibb, at Mr Hardwick's car, was six or seven metres from Mr Winks and thought about using his taser, but decided he was too far away.

This is the final part of the conversation between Mr Winks and SC Cook before the fatal shot was fired:

Winks: 'I'm not putting the gun down, I'll tell you that right now, I'm not putting it down'.

Cook: 'what will it take you to put it down'.

Winks: 'hey?'

Cook: 'What will it take for you to put it down'.

Winks: 'I'm on a no win mate, I'm on a f**king no win, I f**ked up'.

Cook: 'how did you do that, what happened'.

Winks: 'you'll charge me for having a rifle, alright for a start, a gun that's never been fired for thirty f**king years, you'll charge me for that'.

Cook: 'sir don't come any closer'.

Winks: 'and then I can't go on my f**king holiday'.

Cook: 'sir put that rifle down'.

Winks: 'no I won't'.

Cook: 'put it down'.

Winks: 'I told you I won't, see you're not even…

The inquest finding explained that at this point Mr Winks stopped pacing and looked directly at SC Cook, which he thought meant he was ready to talk.

Mr Winks secretly kept an old .22 rifle wrapped in a tarpaulin (right) with spare ammunition and cleaning equipment. He retrieved it the day he died and cleaned the gun while sitting on this rock, where his wife found him loading it. His hat is also discarded to the right of the rock

But instead he 'raised the rifle in both hands to centre chest height and aimed it directly at SC Cook. At this point Mr Winks appeared focused.'

'Believing that Mr Winks was going to shoot him Senior Constable Cook fired at Mr Winks.'

Mr Winks was hit in the upper right chest and fell to the ground, dropping the rifle. It was 5.19pm.

Believing it was Mr Winks who fired, SC Gibbs also fired his pistol but missed.

Officers gave first aid until an ambulance arrived seven minutes later, but Mr Winks was pronounced dead at 5.50pm.

The inquest debated concerns from Mr Winks' family about the rifle being deployed to the scene after he stated that he wanted to be shot by one.

Ultimately, Queensland State Coroner Terry Ryan found police acted appropriately, and commended SC Cook's attempts at negotiation.

The whole family was devastated, with Amy and Trent both feeling like they helped cause his death.

Mrs Winks partially blamed the charges levelled against Amy, and the stress caused by her being denied bail.

'Forty-five years I've been married to him next month. He is the best man I have ever known. But today was the day he wanted to die,' she told police.

'Because he could not handle what injustice has been served on our family and he couldn't help.'

Travis said the family, particularly Trent, for many months held on to a lot of anger against the police for the shooting - until they saw the body cam footage.

'The video showed us they gave him every chance to surrender - they even told him he could hold the gun, just don't wave it around or point it at us. But he wouldn't listen,' he said.

'We knew after that they did what they had to do – I would have pulled the trigger too, because I'd want to go home to my wife and kids. 

'Those poor buggers have to live the rest of their lives with it.'

But Travis is still outraged that it took two years for an inquest to be held into has father's death, while the family remained in limbo. 

'To let something drag on for two years I don't think is acceptable, it needs to be better. We couldn't get closure for two years, which is not good enough,' he said.

As the standoff was taking place, Travis was on his way home from work after a long day of meetings and planning - when he got a call from Emma.

'She said police were looking for dad and he had a gun, but didn't know more,' he recalled.

Emma called him a few more times when she arrived but the reception was too awful to make out what she was saying.

Fearing the worst, Travis excused himself from the dinner table, lit a cigarette, and paced around the garage waiting for updates.

He got a text from Emma that simply said 'he's dead'.

'I dropped to my knees on the concrete floor. I was short of breath. Amanda came in and just held me on the floor,' he said.

Mr Hardwick soon after called him and relayed exactly how his father had died. 

'I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I couldn't comprehend it,' he said.

Travis knew he had to 'man up' as he was the only one who was going to be able to hold everyone together and deal with the aftermath.

Amy was in jail, Trent was in bad shape, Mr Winks had just lost her husband close enough for her to hear the shot, and Emma was too devastated to help.

Travis first flew to the Gold Coast to get Trent and be with him because he was a 'loose cannon' and knew he wouldn't respond well to the news. 

His wife Amanda came with him to confirm the identity of his father's body, in an act of love he doesn't know how he can repay.

'I was terrified to walk in there. She stood by my side and held my hand and told dad she'd look after me,' he said.

July 2018

Trent sprung into action after his father's death, using his sales acumen to help Ms Winks with the financial aspects of her husband's death.

This gave him a purpose and a distraction from his own issues that Travis hoped would spur on a long-term recovery.

But it was not enough, and it wasn't long before Trent fell into an even deeper depression.

'He was lost without dad, dad was his rock and our parents were the only ones he really listened to,' Travis said.

Trent took his own life in July 2018 using a generator to pump carbon monoxide into his father's SUV and was found surrounded by photos of those he loved

Trent was on medication and seeing therapists, but often didn't take his pills and skipped numerous appointments.

Mates offered him work to give him something to focus on, but he always turned them down.

Travis regrets not knowing at the time that money can be withdrawn from superannuation to pay for mental health treatment.

Had the family known it was an option, it could have got Trent into a private facility for lengthy mental health treatment. 

'We'll never know if we could have convinced him to do that, but I would have thrown the kitchen sink at that,' Travis said.

'He needed the real deal, like where footballers go, and the average person can't afford that.'

In July 2018, Trent drove his father's SUV to Merryvale – a town where the family had dinner the night before the funeral at a pub where the owner was an old friend of Mr Winks.

He was found dead in the back of the car, having hired a generator to pump carbon monoxide inside, suffocating him.

Photos of those closest to him - his kids, siblings, parents, and close friends - were scattered around him, along with a handwritten suicide note.

'I walked around after dad's death thinking something else was going to happen as people were too vulnerable,' Travis recalled.

'He ended his pain, but just caused more for the rest of us. My mum lost her son and husband in quick succession.'

Lion Nathan remembered Trent so fondly that the company paid the bar tab for his wake. 

Letting the beast out

The night his brother's body was found, an enraged Travis began typing away on his laptop and within hours had the first chapters of what became Shattered.

'I needed to let the beast out,' he said. He had kept it chained up inside for far too long.

Even as the 67 days were unfolding, and when he came back to work two weeks after his father's death, he held all the pain inside.

His WaveFM 96.5 breakfast listeners had no idea what he was going through, and he wanted it that way.

'It's a fun show and no one wants to hear about your problems so I never spoke about it,' he said.

'I just had to put on a brave face, people have enough problems, they shouldn't be burdened with mine. 

'The show was a good distraction. I could so easily have just folded up and being able to deliver that show was a bit of an escape.'

Shattered to six months to write, and along with reliving painful events, there were a lot of good memories he brought up with his siblings.

'One minute Emma and I would be in tears the next we would be laughing as we reflected on certain things our father did when we were growing up,' he said.

'There’s been a lot of negativity in our family, so it was lovely to be able to reflect on those innocent, happy family moments.'

Even after the cathartic release of writing his book, Travis admits he is still plagued by some of the demons that compelled him to put pen to paper.

'I've told Amy I'm still angry at her sometimes, but I love her,' he said.

'I'm disappointed in my brother because he had to opportunity to be helped and he wouldn't, he had too much pride and was embarrassed about his illness.

'Dad... it makes me really angry because it's such a waste, he worked so hard his whole life and retired at 55 and threw it all away. 

'He took the bulls**t soft option, and I'd say that to his face.' 

Mrs Winks can't catch a break – last week a burglar broke into her house and stole her handbag and valuables and car keys, then wrote off the car.

'I don't know how much more a woman can take. She's lost her husband, her son, and watched her daughter go through hell and pay a high price,' Travis said. 

'She's a broken woman, she has scars that will never heal. I was really worried she would give up but she's still standing and she's a fighter.'

Shattered took six months to write, starting the day of Trent's suicide, and is published this month

Travis said what his family went through showed him there were two ways to deal with trauma - throw in the towel, or fight to come pout the other side.

He hopes anyone who reads his book will be emboldened to take the first option, instead of the one chosen by his father and brother.

'Bad things happen to good people and you can't throw in the towel,' he said.

'When you have experienced trauma or tragedy it is difficult to know where to begin to pick up the pieces and move forward with life. 

'By sharing my story I hope people realise no matter what you do to help, no matter how tough you think a person is, no matter how well you know a person, you just never know what’s going to happen and how people will react when they’re pushed to the limit. You can’t control the uncontrollable. 

'I hope that those who read it realise that for every action there is a consequence, and, for every problem there is an opportunity.'
