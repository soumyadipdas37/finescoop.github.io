Gary Neville has defended Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden after their hotel saga in Iceland that saw them sent home from the England camp.

The pair, who had been awarded their first England caps in Reykjavík, broke the covid-19 protocols and Icelandic law and they snuck two girls into their hotel rooms after the 1-0 victory in the Nations League. They were caught on snapchat as the girls filmed their time with the pair.

They were both fined by the Icelandic authorities and sent packing by manager Gareth Southgate and are under investigation by the FA.

'I mean at this moment in time, I'm sure they will be feeling awful,' Neville told Sky Sports. 

'We have seen both of their apologies, obviously being removed from the squad is something that you never want during your career. But always, whether it be any incident over the last 10 years on TV, you always have to go back into player mode when you are in that dressing room.

'Mistakes you have made in life, that you've seen teammates make. They need love right now. They're young lads, they aren't robots. Anybody at home who has been 18, 19, 20 would have either themselves or seen a friend of theirs do something like that in their life; breaching discipline, let yourself down, have a fight.'

The Manchester United forward broke his silence after landing back in the UK following his exile from the Three Lions camp. 

In a statement released on United's website, Greenwood said: 'Having now had the chance to reflect on what's happened, I can only apologise to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused.

'It was irresponsible of me to break the COVID-19 protocols which are in place to protect players, staff and the public. In particular, I want to apologise to Gareth Southgate, for letting him down, when he had shown great trust in me.

'Playing for England was one of the proudest moments in my life and I only have myself to blame for this huge mistake. I promise my family, the fans, Manchester United and England that this is a lesson I will learn from.' 

Meanwhile, Foden took to Twitter to an issue an apology.  

He said: 'Following the story which has emerged today regarding my actions in Iceland, I want to make a full apology.

'I apologise to Gareth Southgate, to my England team mates, to the staff, supporters, and also to my Club and family.

Foden took to social media on Monday evening to issue a full apology to everybody involved

'I am a young player with a lot to learn, but I am aware of the huge responsibility I have in representing Manchester City and England at this level.

'On this occasion I made a poor decision and my behaviour didn't meet the standards expected of me.

'I breached COVID-19 protocols put in place to protect myself and my England colleagues. As a consequence I will now miss the opportunity to travel to Denmark with the squad, and that hurts.' 

When asked whether the severity of the punishment should be greater due to their responsibilities representing England, Neville replied: 'I get it, it's not ideal, they've made a mistake, a big mistake. 

'They'll regret it and they'll pay for it. But they are two talented individuals, they live on the edge, they live off adrenaline, the buzz and their lives are fast. We can slate them, slag them off, all those things they know are true but there also has to be a level of tolerance over what they are. 

Neville admitted that they both made a 'big mistake' but people will eventually forget about it 

'Yes they are representing their country and they will feel really bad. They will feel more gutted when their teammates are running out on the pitch. They'll feel like the whole world is coming down around them, it's not. 

'We have seen situations like this 100 times, in 6 months' time, won't get mentioned that much. 6 years' time no one will remember it. They have to remember that tonight. They will still be loved by their teammates. The reality is they are young kids.

Fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher agreed with Neville but believes they may struggle to earn a call-up to the next Three Lions squad under Southgate.  

Carragher said: 'I'm with Gary. I've been sent home from England squad before, under 21s.

'Obviously different circumstances, four or five of us sent home, had to move away from the squad. We weren't punished after, this was more a drinking situation after a game. We spoke to the manager, apologised and were back in the squad. 

'I think the lads may find it tough to get themselves back in the next squad. Gareth will want to put a marker down there. There have been situations in the past with him involving Rooney, Sterling and Gomez. 

'So there may be some punishment to come, but it won't be set in stone. I do think they will be used in the Euros, they are two of the best young English players coming through. And just because you are good, your mistakes shouldn't be forgotten, but just keep their head down and let their football do the talking.'
