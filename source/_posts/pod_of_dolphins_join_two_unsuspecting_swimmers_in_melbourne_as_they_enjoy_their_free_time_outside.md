The magical moment a pair of swimmers were joined by a playful pod of dolphins on Victoria's coast has been caught on camera.

The two swimmers were relaxing in the ocean off the coast of Lorne on the Great Ocean Road, 138km south-west of Melbourne.  

Since Melbourne has been in a hard lockdown since August 2, residents in regional Victoria, including Lorne, have been allowed to go outside to exercise without the strict one-hour time limit.

They are also allowed to undergo outdoor recreation but can only gather with one person from outside their household in public. 

But that is all due to change at 11.59pm Wednesday when regional parts of the state progress to the third step in Premier Daniel Andrews' lockdown reopening roadmap.

As they were floating a dolphin leapt out of the water, startling the two swimmers.

Footage of the encounter was posted on Facebook with the caption: 'this dolphin came out to play with the swimmers this morning...'.

The dolphin continued to be cheeky and swim between them while doing flips in the water.

One of the swimmers was even seen diving under the water the interact with the playful creatures. 

The video quickly received lots of attention with more than 600 likes and comments saying the dolphin has been a regular in the area.

'Far out!!!!! What an absolute blessing,' one Facebook user wrote.

'This is amazing this dolphin has been hanging around allot wanting to make friends with all that comes near. Soooo beautiful,' another said.

'That’s amazing footage, what a special place,' another person commented.

The four reasons to leave your home will no longer apply, most workplaces will reopen and schools will return with a staggered start in regional Victoria.

Gathering limits will also increase to 10 people outdoors and up to five nominated visitors from another household bubble.

Gathering limits will increase to 10 people at weddings, 20 mourners at funerals and 10 people plus one faith leader at outdoor religious gatherings.

Melburnians (pictured at Elwood beach) are expected to flock to regional Victoria in search of eased restrictions as outdoor gathering limits are raised to 10 and restaurant dining resumes  

Children can also return to community sport and adults will be able to take part in non-contact sport. 

Mr Andrews announced the eased restrictions for regional Victorians on Tuesday.

'There are no new cases in regional Victoria and that means there are just 43 active cases across regional Local Government Areas.

'I am absolutely delighted to be able to announce that regional Victoria from 11.59pm tomorrow night will be able to take the Third Step,' he said.

The premier commended regional Victorians for adhering to the tough lockdown.

'I am so, so pleased and proud of every single regional Victorian who has stayed the course, follow the rules and got tested.

'There is no greater evidence to the people of Melbourne that this strategy, getting numbers low, is essential,' Mr Andrews explained. 

Outdoor gathering limits will increase to 10 people. That number does not include infants under the age of 12 months.

People in regional Victoria will also be able to leave their homes without restriction. 

Limits for outdoor religious gatherings and weddings will increase to 10 people, while funeral limits will rise to 20 mourners.
