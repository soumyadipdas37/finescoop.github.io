Former NSW Premier John Fahey was farewelled at a state funeral out of Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral on Friday.

The two-hour requiem mass was celebrated by Catholic Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher. 

A plethora of Australian political identities were on hand to pay their respects, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, and three former Prime Ministers - John Howard, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott.

Others to attend included fellow ex-NSW Premier Mike Baird, Governor General David Hurley, one time NSW Premier Bob Carr and radio tsar Alan Jones.

COVID-19 restrictions saw the guest list extended to family and friends only.

Mr Fahey was NSW Premier from 1992 to 1995 and played an integral role in the bid for Sydney to host the 2000 Olympic Games before going on to become federal finance minister.

After leaving politics, Mr Fahey took on a new role as the president for the World Anti-Doping Agency.

He also became a senior adviser to JP Morgan and a National Catholic Education commissioner, along with joining the board of the Cancer Institute and the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

He was also later appointed as chancellor of the Australian Catholic University.  

As state premier, Mr Fahey introduced the disability services act, the seniors card and appointed the first minister for the status of women. 

He died on September 12 after a battle with leukemia.

Mr Fahey will be laid to rest privately after the mass on Friday.
