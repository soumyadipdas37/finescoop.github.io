Carl Froch insists Wikipedia's $20million (£15m) net worth valuation of him is 'quite accurate'.

The multiple super-middleweight world champion, who now works for Sky Sports, was speaking on the Gary Newbon Sports Show about his wealth and his career. 

But Froch, who reportedly earned £10m for beating George Groves, insists 'money isn't everything' to him as his family is more important.

'I did ok throughout my career. Financially I am in a great position. I don't know where Wikipedia get their figures from. But you can Wikipedia it "Carl Froch net worth" and it's around $20million,' Froch said. 

'I won't say that's correct either way but it's quite accurate. I've done very well out of the sport but you know money isn't everything.

'I have three kids, I have my health. I can have a conversation without a problem. I wake up with my children I have breakfast with them everyday, I take them to school and pick them up everyday. 

'My daughter started school this week. I love my kids so much. That's my wealth. My wealth is my health and my children and my love for my family. I have never really been motivated by money.'

Froch was also asked why he never fought Welsh fighter Joe Calzaghe as Froch was Calzaghe's mandatory at one point in their careers.

Froch said: 'That would have been a great fight. If you asked Joe Calzaghe who would win he would say straight away without even thinking about it he would say "easy fight for me, I would have beat him no problem. I'm all wrong for him". 

'If you asked me who wins that fight. There's a very high chance Calzaghe beats me on points. It's very conceivable that i would lose that fight on points. He had fast hands, a high work rate that I've never seen in that division.

'He's got toughness, high work rate, how do you beat him? I think I would have backed him up and beat him. I think the fight could have gone either way. 

'I think I could have stopped him but I could have lost on points. Why did it not happen? I was mandatory for his title. He didn't want the fight so he vacated the belt. 

'Whether he didn't want the fight or not, he vacated the title. When he could have fought me or vacate the belt, he vacated the belt. The fight didn't happen because Joe Calzaghe didn't want the fight to happen.'
