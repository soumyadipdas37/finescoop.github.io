Keeping all eyes on her figure, Malin opted for minimal makeup and wore a hint of bronze eyeshadow with a touch of nude gloss for the Empowering Every Curve campaign. 

Captioning the snaps, the mental health campaigner penned: 'EMPOWERING EVERY CURVE I HAVE! Our bodies are here to be loved, not hated on.

She ended: 'Designed by women for women. #ad #myboux @bouxavenue.'

The reality star's ex Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3 after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.   

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.
