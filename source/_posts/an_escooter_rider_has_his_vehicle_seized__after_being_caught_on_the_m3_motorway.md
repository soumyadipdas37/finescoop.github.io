 An e-scooter rider in his 50s has his vehicle seized and is slapped with six points on his driving license, after being caught by police driving down a motorway.

The driver was pulled over by officers while on the hard shoulder of the M3 in Hampshire.

He had been spotted joining the southbound carriageway near Eastleigh from the sliproad before police stopped him.

He was slapped with a fine, given six points on his driving licence and had his scooter seized.

Hampshire Constabulary warned that e-scooters are illegal to use on public roads and footpaths.

A post on the Hants Roads Policing Twitter account said: 'Unbelievably the rider of this e-scooter thought it was ok to ride on the M3 near Eastleigh.... yes, the motorway!

'They have been issued with a fine, 6 points on their driving licence and the scooter seized for no insurance.

'Just a reminder that they are illegal to use on public roads and footpaths unless rented as part of the trial zones.

'You risk getting points, fine and your scooter being seized if used illegally.'

The Government is currently conducting a trial of electric, or e-scooter, rental fleets in cities across the country with a view to legalisation.

It was reported last week that e-scooters could even be fitted with number plates after warnings that antisocial behaviour related to their use is on the rise.
