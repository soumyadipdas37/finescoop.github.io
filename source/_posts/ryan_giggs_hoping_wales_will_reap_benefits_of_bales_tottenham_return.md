Ryan GiggsÂ believes Gareth Bale will be even better for Wales at Euro 2020 after ending his Real Madrid nightmare by rejoining Tottenham on loan.

Bale enjoyed huge success in the Spanish capital, winning four Champions League titles, but a breakdown in relations with coach Zinedine Zidane paved the way for him to move back to Spurs for at least one season.

Despite his recent lack of playing time in Madrid, Bale has usually shone on international duty, and Giggs is confident that more regular football will make the 31-year-old an even more dangerous opponent at next summer's tournament.

Giggs said: 'It doesn't matter what quality and experience he possesses, it's always better when you are playing, especially in the international arena when you have two games in a short space of time.

'To play a game and then go again a few days later is very difficult. It will be so much better if he is playing regularly, he will be sharper and able to play those two games in a short space of time.

'It is always difficult. He's been able to manage it and produce performances because he looks after himself but it will be so much better when he is playing regularly.'

Bale was left out of the squad for the friendly against England at Wembley next Thursday, as well as the Nations League fixtures in Ireland and Bulgaria.

Giggs expects that Bale will soon recapture his best form now he is working with Jose Mourinho in north London.

He added: 'He's at a club he knows well with a very good manager and he's said himself it's like going back home.

'He will play more regularly than he did at Madrid. It's a good move for Gareth, it's good for Spurs and good for the Premier League in general, to have someone like that who we can watch every week.'
