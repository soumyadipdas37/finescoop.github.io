It is hoped that Motson, who is reportedly now out of hospital, will be able to appear on talkSPORT on Friday.

His colleagues at the radio station, Paul Hawksbee and Andy Jacobs, sent Motson good wishes.

Jacobs said: 'We should wish Motty well. He was gonna be with us tomorrow.'

Hawksbee said: 'Yeah, Motty's had a fall. And he's in the hospital at the moment, he's gone to the hospital. So we do wish Motty all the best and a speedy recovery.'

Motson was the BBC's voice of football, having covered over 2000 games on television and radio since starting out in 1969.

He commentated on ten World Cups, ten European Championships and 29 FA Cup finals. 

After retiring from commentating in 2018, he returned to work with talkSPORT later that year.
