A woman has captured the moment her mother fell through her ceiling as she practised her singing ahead of college auditions. 

The teenager, who has just moved to New York to study musical theatre, was filming a warm up routine at her childhood home.

She didn't expect her mother to come crashing through her ceiling after slipping on her flip flops while searching for luggage in the attic.

Posting the clip to Tik Tok she wrote: 'Live footage of my mom telling me to break a leg #FreezeFramePhoto #GardenProject #shesokay #breakaleg #ceiling #musical #fyp'

The teenager, who has just moved to New York to study musical theatre, was filming a warm up routine at her childhood home. She didn't expect her mother to come crashing through her ceiling after slipping on her flip flops while searching for luggage in the attic

The short clip shows Liz, whose username is lizjsm, singing along to a piece of music before dramatically ducking when a piece of ceiling in the corner of the room collapsed behind her.

As she turned around she shouted 'Oh my God' as her mother's leg dangled down into the room. 

In a follow up video Liz revealed her mother 'didn't even get a bruise' and the hole was still in the ceiling after an attempt to repair it with duct tape failed.

She said: 'So the story is I am moving to New York to go to school for musical theatre and I was practising for my placement auditions for my classes and she was up in the attic at the same time looking for luggage.' 

Liz said there were wooden beams in the attic where her mother should have stepped, but she tripped on her 'super cute little silver flip flops and fell'.

'I got it on video and it was amazing. But she's fine, she's great and I didn't know it was going to happen and it scared the crap out of me but she's good,' she added.
