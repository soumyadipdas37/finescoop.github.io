A stunning travel blogger and TikTok star has revealed her private DMs with The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert.

Claire Lucinda went viral this week after posting a video to TikTok that revealed what appeared to be private direct messages with Locky.

The brunette beauty was lip syncing to suggestive lyrics in the video, including 'You tryna keep us a secret' and 'You don't want your other hoes to see'.

Many fans interpreted Claire's viral TikTok to mean that she'd been speaking to Locky during his time on The Bachelor, but the blogger has now clarified that's not the case. 

Speaking to The Wash, Claire said that she was speaking to Locky last year while Australian Survivor All Stars was airing.  

Once The Bachelor was about to begin, Claire says she stopped chatting to Locky 'out of respect for the girls'.

'We were planning on catching up, but then when it all got announced he was [doing The Bachelor] there was really no point continuing to chat anymore,' she explained.

'I would never in a million years want to undermine what he is doing on the show and any connections he is making with girls there,' she continued.

'They are all absolutely beautiful and I’m sure some have an amazing connection with him. I would never want to step on any toes.'

Locky was caught 'liking' a bunch of photos on Instagram of bikini-clad Love Island stars back in April.

After his cheeky 'likes' resurfaced on social media this week, former Bachelorette Angie Kent called the hunk out for being 'disrespectful'.

Responding to a compilation of screenshots showing Locky's likes, Angie wrote: 'I find it super disrespectful when dudes who have girlfriends go on cute little liking sprees of babes in bathers or lingerie.'

She continued: 'I mean sure, have a good old look and appreciate the magic that is the female chass, you’re only human.... but unless home girl is your girlfriend or ya best friend, how about you don’t go and double tap that? It’s not that hard.

'Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. Their big male egos would throw toys so far out of their prams... we’d never hear the god damn end of it.'

Locky's most recent ex-girlfriend, former Love Island Australia star Jordan Cayless, responded to Angie's rant: 'Couldn't have said it better myself!'

Claims: Locky's season of The Bachelor is currently airing on Channel 10
