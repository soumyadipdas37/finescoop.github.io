Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has confirmed that the Italian side are interested in signing Arsenal defender Sokratis. 

The Greek centre-back has fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal and could leave as Arsenal look to generate more money for new signings.

If Sokratis was to join Napoli it could lead to Kalidou Koulibaly making the switch to Manchester City. 

Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has confirmed the club's interest in signing Sokratis

As reported by Il Napoli Online, De Laurentiis said: 'We are working on signing Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Arsenal, we consider it an option.'

Speaking about the possibility of selling City target Koulibaly, he said: 'When there are important offers, we will sell.' 

Sokratis has prior experience of Italian football having previously played for Genoa and AC Milan.

De Laurentiis admitted that Napoli are open to selling players in this window for the right price

If Sokratis was to join Napoli it could lead to Manchester City signing Kalidou Koulibaly

He has played 69 times for Arsenal since joining from Borussia Dortmund two years ago, but was used sparingly after last season restarted. 

Arsenal have many centre-backs on their books, with another having joined this week in Gabriel Magalhaes.

City, meanwhile, are eager to secure a deal for Koulibaly, who could cost £72million.

Pep Guardiola's side have already brought in Nathan Ake from Bournemouth in this transfer window and Koulibaly could also make the switch to the Etihad Stadium.
