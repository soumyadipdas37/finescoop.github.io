Australian foodies are marvelling over a mum's surprising 'genius' tactic for making a large batch of boiled eggs without the shell.

Mum Laura shared the quick cooking hack to the Instant Pot Community Facebook group and said it 'works a charm' as the eggs don't need to be individually peeled once boiled.

She first cracked eight eggs into a heatproof bowl that was sprayed with oil, then placed the bowl into a pot and filled it with one cup of hot water.

She cooked the eggs on a medium heat for five minutes until they were boiled to add into a salad.

'I'm making potato salad and needed eight boiled eggs, chopped. Did you know you can just crack them in a bowl and put the whole bowl in the pot? No ice bath or peeling required,' she said online.

'The resulting bowl-shaped egg loaf is initially horrifying, but once you chop it up, it's wonderful!'

The time-saving hack quickly went viral and was shared more than 81,000 times online, as other foodies were left amazed.Â

'This is genius. I hate peeling eggs!' one person said online.

'That is a game changer!' another said, and a third added: 'So clever!'

'Then use a baking rack that has a smallish square grid, and simply push it through. Instantly diced,' a fourth suggested.

The easy cooking method can be completed as long as a heatproof bowl is used to place into a pot.
