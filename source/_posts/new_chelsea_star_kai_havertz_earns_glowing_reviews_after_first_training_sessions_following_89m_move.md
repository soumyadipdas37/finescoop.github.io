Chelsea's record signing Kai Havertz has earned glowing reviews after his first training sessions with the club, according to reports.

The 21-year-old playmaker sealed an £89million move to west London earlier this month from Bayer Leverkusen and is expected to play an integral role in the new-look team next season.

It appears Havertz is ready and raring for his Premier League debut with Goal claiming that he has impressed with his hard work at the club's Cobham complex.

The 21-year-old, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen, is said to have earned glowing reviews

He began training with his new Chelsea team-mates on Saturday, less than 24 hours after jetting out to England to officially put pen to paper on his lucrative five-year deal.

Havertz has been put through his paces by coaching staff in a bid to get him in perfect shape for the club's opening top flight fixture against Brighton on September 14. 

The recent indications from Chelsea's camp suggest that the superstar will almost certainly start on the south coast.

His arrival extended the Stamford Bridge outfit's remarkable £230m summer spending spree. Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner will often combine with the Germany international next season as part of a lethal strike force.

Xavier Mbuyamba, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva have also been recruited as part of the push for silverware. 

Havertz scored 18 goals and laid on nine assists in 45 appearances for Leverkusen last season - and the move now makes him the joint-most expensive player ever signed by a British club.

The highly-rated forward has admitted that his decision to head to England was largely swayed by Blues boss Frank Lampard's 'big impact'.

'Of course he had a big impact on my decision because I loved him as a player and watched him very often, and I think I can learn from him now he is a manager as well,' he told the official club website.

'I think he is a very humble person and a great guy and I can't wait to play with him and learn from him.

'He was very offensive like me and he loves to score goals, and I love to score goals as well so I think he will help me a lot in my position. Also maybe on the things that I can improve and I can't wait to work with him.' 

Goal have also reported that fellow new signing Ben Chilwell is expected to miss the first two games of the new season, however, due to a heel injury.
