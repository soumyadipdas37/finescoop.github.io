Russian bombshell Irina Shayk showcased her incredibly taut midriff in a white crop top as she enjoyed some quality time with her three-year-old daughter Lea.  

As she strutted down the sidewalk in New York City on Friday, the 34-year-old supermodel sported a pair of baggy pants, which were embroidered with crucifixes. 

While keeping her gym-honed abs on full display, she layered her stylish ensemble with a black jean jacket and her signature Doc Marten combat boots.

The beauty, who shares her little girl with ex Bradley Cooper, followed her state's strict requirement to wear a mask or face covering, as of April 15. 

Shayk pushed her mini-me, who wore a black Versace sweatshirt and pink shoes, in a black and navy stroller. 

Like Lea, the Vogue cover girl styled her hair in two braids and appeared to be enjoying the fresh air.

The doting mom was later seen, walking around solo, after presumably dropping off her tot off with Cooper or a caretaker.

While on her own, she hid her expression under a pair of razor thin sunglasses and removed her black face mask.  

Irina shares 50/50 joint legal and physical custody of her daughter with her ex-partner, according to TMZ.

And while Shayk and Cooper officially ended their four-year romance in June 2019, the amicable exes were spotted embracing each other on September 8. 

Cooper is on break from filming his role as Barbra Streisand's hairdresser-turned-movie producer Jon Peters in Paul Thomas Anderson's untitled seventies San Fernando Valley-set flick. 

The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.

'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she's back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March. 

'He's been making an effort to take projects that aren't too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he's very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he'd carry her everywhere.'

'He's totally devoted to Lea, it's really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.

He's been back in NYC after spending time in Southern California shooting a yet-to-be-titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.

She has been spotted several times with her potential new boyfriend Vito Schnabel, who is a longtime pal and previously dated Heidi Klum.

Earlier this week, Shayk revealed her ice cube skincare secret in a Vogue 'day-to-night makeup' vlog.

'I grew up in very cold weather,' the By.Alexander brand ambassador explained in the 10-minute tutorial.

'When I wake up or travel, and feel a little swollen [with] bags under my eyes, I run to the fridge and I get an ice cube, and [glide it] all around my eye area, my chin, [and] all around my face.'

Shayk wrapped up in a gold Versace robe as she recommended using 12 different products ranging in price from $30 Pat McGrath Labs Dark Star Volumizing Mascara to $394 Mimi Luzon 24K Pure Gold One Treatment.
