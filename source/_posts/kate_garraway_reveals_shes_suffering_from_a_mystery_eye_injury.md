Kate Garraway has told fans that she is suffering from a painful eye injury.

Speaking in an Instagram video on Wednesday, the star told her followers she would do her best to get through her Smooth Radio show, but she was struggling to see.

Kate, 53, has only recently returned to her weekday show, after taking time out to care for her children while her husband Derek Draper remains in hospital battling the long-term effects of COVID-19.

Ouch: Kate Garraway has told fans that she is suffering from a painful eye injury, doing her best on Wednesday to get through her Smooth Radio show

Wednesday's video showed Kate sitting in the Smooth Radio studio, looking chic in a printed shirt and wearing glasses. 

'Morning! Am I looking clever?' she asked viewers, before explaining: 'I always think that when I've got my glasses on I look a bit more brainy. But if you're listening to me on Smooth Radio you'll know that nothing has actually changed.'

'I've got a really sore eye. It's really hurting and I don't know what I've done to it. I can't put my contacts in and I'm wearing my glasses.'

'The songs however, are as perfect as they always are here on Smooth Radio so do join me!' she urged.

Kate then joked: 'And for an extra game you can see if I get the names right of the bands on the playlist because I can't read very well either.

'But it's relaxing listening and that's what counts!' she added. 

Earlier this month, Kate confirmed she would be returning to work on Smooth Radio so Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'

The presenter had taken time off work to spend time with her children and Derek who remains in intensive care, where he has spent the last six months. 

As she announced her return to the airwaves, Kate acknowledged the frightening circumstances she currently faces, but hopes work will provide a welcome distraction for both herself and her husband. 

Still smiling! 'I've got a really sore eye. It's really hurting and I don't know what I've done to it. I can't put my contacts in and I'm wearing my glasses,' she explained

She said to The Sun: 'I’m delighted to be returning to my morning show on Smooth and to my Global family who have been a big support to me.

'Things are still hugely challenging and a long way from being normal, but I’d like to think that this will give Derek yet another opportunity to hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.

'My heartfelt thanks go to Myleene Klass who has been brilliantly care taking the show for me and to all my regular listeners for their messages of support.'

She admitted there couldn't be a more relaxing job to ease her back into a stable work routine.

In the midst of Derek's health battle, Kate has focused on looking after their children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14.

She announced her temporary departure from Good Morning Britain in August so she could help her children prepare for their return to school, after returning for a few weeks earlier in the summer.
