Actress Pia Miller could very well be returning to screens nationwide after uploading a 'back on set' post at her old stomping ground.

The former Home and away actress set fans into a frenzy when she checked in at Palm Beach - home to fictional coastal town Summer Bay.

The 36-year-old uploaded a picture of a sunrise at the familiar beach, where she used to play policewoman Katarina Chapman on Home and Away.

The character was killed off in a horror crash during the show's season finale in December 2017.

Pia moved on to staring in serial killer TV show Bite Club in August 1018, where she played Kate Summers - detective Zoe Rawlings' best friend.

She cheekily captioned the post uploaded to her story on Wednesday: 'Hello again.'

A second image of her 'back on set' further fueled speculation she is returning to the Summer Bay set.

The Chilean-born model was pictured standing in front of a camera on the sand at Palm Beach while dressed to the nines.

Pia was captured wearing a long apricot-coloured slit dress, with her locks perfectly in place.

'Back on set today for the first time in months,' the post's caption read. 

Her tease follows Pia moving into $7.8million home in Sydney's eastern suburbs and reuniting with her multi-millionaire agent boyfriend Patrick Whitesell, 55. 

The mother-of-two and her beau were seen spending quality time with her youngest son Lennox, 13, on September 15.

The post also follows Pia telling Now To Love in 2017 'it was super emotional' leaving Home and Away after the show's finale.

 'I felt sad but also really proud to have been part of the show,' she said.

'I think knowing it was my last scene was as emotional as the actual premise of the scene itself.

'The cast and crew become an extended family, we spend more time with them then we do our own families sometimes so it was incredibly hard knowing I wouldn't be returning back on set the following week.'
