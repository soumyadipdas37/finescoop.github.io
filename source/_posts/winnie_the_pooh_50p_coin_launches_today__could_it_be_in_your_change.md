Four versions of the design will be made available, selling for up to £1,125

Winnie the Pooh will become the latest character from a children's book to appear on a 50p coin, complete with a jar of honey, although those hoping to find one in their change will be left feeling sour.

Launched a little more than a century  on from the birth of Christopher Robin Milne, the son of Winnie the Pooh creator A.A. Milne, the Royal Mint said the coin would be the first in a wider collection featuring the characters from the children's books.

The Mint teased two other designs for upcoming 50p coins featuring Christopher Robin and Piglet, but if the first coin released from the Hundred Acre Wood proves as popular as previous sets then there is no doubt others will follow.

The bear, who first appeared in a book of the same name in 1926, follows other much-loved characters from children's books like Peter Rabbit, Paddington Bear and the Gruffalo onto the face of 50p coins.

However, unlike the first two and other characters from Beatrix Potter's books, Pooh will not be released into circulation and the coin will only be available to buy from the Mint.

Four versions of the design will be put on sale: brilliant uncirculated, coloured, silver proof and gold proof. 

An unlimited number of brilliant uncirculated coins will be available to buy, while there will be 45,000 coloured, 18,000 silver and just 525 gold coins put on sale.

Prices range from £10 for the basic brilliant uncirculated version all the way up to £1,125 for the 525 gold coins, enough to buy 833 jars of own brand honey from Tesco, collectively weighing 378.1kg.

Although the coin not entering circulation is a blow for collectors, especially those hoping to sell it on for a profit, commemorative children's coins have proved incredibly popular in recent years.

Beatrix Potter 50p coins displaying the likes of Jemima Puddle-Duck, Tom Kitten and Flopsy Bunny have sold in the hundreds of thousands according to the latest Royal Mint sales figures, which cover commemorative coin sales as recently as 2017. 

The Mint sold 221,866 2017 brilliant uncirculated Peter Rabbit 50p coins, 165,668 Jeremy Fisher 50p coins and 159,302 Tom Kitten 50p coins. 

These are far lower numbers than the fabled Kew Gardens 50p coin. This circulating coin can now fetch more than £100 on websites such as eBay. 

And the release of three 50p coins featuring the Gruffalo in February 2019 sparked such a rush to the deep dark wood to get hold of them that the Royal Mint's website crashed just after midnight, while This is Money found itself in a queue of more than an hour the next morning to even get onto the website.
