Victoria Beckham shared a slew of snaps from her couples' health retreat holiday with husband David on Instagram on Saturday.  

The fashion designer, 46, and the retired footballer, 45, stayed at Villa Stéphanie in Baden Baden in Germany's Black Forest, where a seven night programme starts from £3,430 per person.   

Victoria looked a far cry away from her Posh Spice days in her 'postcard' photos from the spa break.

In one photo, the mother-of-four donned black leggings, a jumper and a baseball cap as she perched on a rock during a hike with David, who wrapped his arms around her. 

In another snap, Victoria teased a hint on her sports bra in a low-scoop vest as she enjoyed a bit of relaxation and recuperation on the sofa. 

She wrote: 'Minimal make-up and ReeboxXVictoriaBeckham'.

'Delicious, healthy meals': The couple met a nutritional coach on the day of arrival for a consultation to analyse personal preferences and needs

With just 15 rooms and suites, the spa states it is a 'couture' service for those wanting to experience the very best and achieve effective, long-term results with the utmost privacy and discretion. 

And David was a huge fan of the food. The couple met a nutritional coach on the day of arrival for a consultation to analyse personal preferences and needs. 

As a result, the couple had individually-created menus by chefs, which were bursting with vegetables and fish, with David showing off his meals on Instagram. 

The former footballer revealed he had been eating vegetarian meals for the past three weeks and wrote: 'Never done this before but I've been eating veggie for the last three weeks.' 

Villa Stéphanie is also dedicated to 'digital detox', so the two could completely disconnect their suite from the electric grid and WiFi.

The luxury retreat has a three-night programme which starts from £1,648 or a seven night stay for £3,430.
