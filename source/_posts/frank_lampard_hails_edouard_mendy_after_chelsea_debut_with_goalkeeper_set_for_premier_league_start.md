Frank Lampard looks to have finally found a solution to his goalkeeping woes after Edouard Mendy made an impressive start to his Chelsea career against Tottenham.

Mendy was handed his first start in the fourth-round Carabao Cup tie after completing a £22million move from Rennes last week and produced a fine stop from Sergio Reguilon.

The 'keeper had one nervy moment when he dropped a cross in the second half but was powerless to do anything about Erik Lamela's late equaliser for the home side.

Frank Lampard said he was very pleased with the goalkeeper's commanding performance 

The 28-year-old's debut ended with a penalty shoot-out and while he was unable to keep out any of Spurs' spot-kicks, Lampard insisted he was delighted with his new signing's first outing.

'I thought he was very good,' said the Chelsea boss after his side's League Cup exit.

'He made a couple of good saves, one particularly good save.

The goalkeeper was called into action a number of times and made some impressive stops

But the 28-year-old was unable to keep out any of Tottenham's penalties in the shoot-out

'He came and caught a few balls, even the one where he came and didn't catch, the idea that he wants to be positive is not a bad thing. Very, very pleased with every part of his game, really.' 

Mendy looks set to make his first Premier League start against Crystal Palace on Saturday with neither Kepa Arrizabalaga or Willy Caballero doing enough to convince Lampard they should play.

Kepa was dropped for the Blues' draw with West Brom after mistakes against Brighton and Liverpool.

But Caballero did not cover himself in much glory as Chelsea conceded three first-half goals at the Hawthorns.

Lampard will hope Mendy can become his settled first choice 'keeper with the Blues looking to get back to winning ways at Stamford Bridge this weekend.
