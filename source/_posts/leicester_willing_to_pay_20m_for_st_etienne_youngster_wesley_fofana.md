Leicester are willing to offer £20m for St Etienne's Wesley Fofana after being encouraged that the 19-year-old may be open to leaving.

AC Milan and Everton have also checked on Fofana who was outstanding last season but the Foxes are leading the race as they continue their search for defensive reinforcements.

Brendan Rodgers utilised midfielder Wilfried Ndidi at centre-back on Saturday.

New signing Timothy Castagne will join up with the Leicester camp soon due to international duty, after he joined the Midlands club from Atalanta in a deal worth £22million.

Rodgers sealed the Belgian's signature following Ben Chilwell's £50million exit to Chelsea, as the 24-year-old penned a five-year deal with Leicester. 

Elsewhere, Foxes midfielder Adrien Silva has interest from Sampdoria.
