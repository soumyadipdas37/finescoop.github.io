Abbie Chatfield tried her hand at surfing on Thursday, wearing a purple bikini and a rash shirt for the occasion.

The 25-year-old former Bachelor hopeful enrolled in a day course with Get Wet Surf School on the Gold Coast.

But after asking her instructors for their honest opinions after her lesson, Abbie discovered her talents may lay elsewhere.

Despite thinking she 'did okay' out in the water, Abbie asked instructors Sami and Blake for a 'review', filming the whole interaction for Instagram Stories.   

'She's as good as she is at surfing as she is at dancing,' deadpanned Sami, prompting Abbie to respond, 'Okay, bit of shade, but that's fine.' 

Blake said a photo of him facepalming himself while out in the surf with Abbie summed up the experience for him.

Taking it all in her stride, the reality star laughed at their assessments of her surfing ability, as photos of her out in the water flashed up on a screen behind them.

The surf school also posted a series of photos of Abbie during her lesson, and said what she lacked in skill, she made up for in 'energy and enthusiasm'.  

'Such a pleasure meeting the beautiful @abbiechatfield today,' they captioned the photos. 

Practice makes perfect: In one photo, Abbie was seen practicing to stand up on her surfboard on a patch of grass, before taking it into the water

That bad? Blake said a photo of him facepalming himself while out in the surf with Abbie summed up the experience for him

'Your energy and enthusiasm was contagious. Can't wait to get you back out there'.

In one photo, Abbie was seen practicing to stand up on her surfboard on a patch of grass, before taking it into the water.

Other photos showed the reality star looking slightly terrified as she concentrated on staying upright on her board. 

'Such a pleasure meeting the beautiful @abbiechatfield today. Your energy and enthusiasm was contagious. Can't wait to get you back out there,' the surf school wrote on Instagram
