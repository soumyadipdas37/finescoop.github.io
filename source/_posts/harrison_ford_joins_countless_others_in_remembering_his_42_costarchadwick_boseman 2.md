Harrison Ford is the most recent Hollywood actor to honor and remember the late Chadwick Boseman, whose death on Friday at age 43 shocked the industry. 

In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Monday, the 78-year-old  Indiana Jones star called Boseman 'as much a hero as any he played.'

The pair costarred in the 2013 film 42 which followed the life of baseball legend Jackie Robinson.

'Chadwick Boseman was as compelling, powerful and truthful as the characters he chose to play,' Ford said in the statement. 

'His intelligence, personal dignity and deep commitment inspired his colleagues and elevated the stories he told. He is as much a hero as any he played. 

'He is loved and will be deeply missed,' the Star Wars alum concluded.

On Friday, Chadwick succumbed to a secret four-year battle with colon cancer, which sent shockwaves throughout the film world and beyond.

The Los Angeles baseball team the LA Dodgers held a moment of silence for Chadwick on Saturday night ahead of their game, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation posted a heartfelt tribute on social media to the Black Panther star. 

Boseman's costars from that record-breaking Marvel film as well as other movies in which he appeared have also penned touching homages to the fallen actor.

Tributes came from his Da 5 Bloods co-star Clarke Peters, as well as his Black Panther director Ryan Coogler. 

'Chadwick Boseman was as compelling, powerful and truthful as the characters he chose to play,' Ford, who played Dodgers executive Branch Rickey in the film, said in a statement 

'His intelligence, personal dignity and deep commitment inspired his colleagues and elevated the stories he told. He is as much a hero as any he played,' he continued about the fallen star

Coogler, 34, called Boseman 'a caretaker, a leader, and a man of faith' in his remembrance of the MCU leading man.

And actress Danai Gurira, who played the Black Panther's primary Wakandan bodyguard/attendant Okoye, also shared an emotional message about her late costar.

'How do you honor a king? Reeling from the loss of my colleague, my friend, my brother. Struggling for words. Nothing feels adequate,' Gurira, 42, began.

'I always marveled at how special Chadwick was. Such a pure hearted, profoundly generous, regal, fun guy. My entire job as Okoye was to respect and protect a king. Honor his leadership. Chadwick made that job profoundly easy,' she added.

'He was the epitome of kindness, elegance, diligence and grace. On many an occasion I would think how thankful I was that he was the leading man I was working closely with. A true class act,' she continued.

Others who remembered the late actor include Angela Bassett, who played his queen mother in 2018's Black Panther, Viola Davis, Mark Ruffalo, LeBron James and his Da 5 Bloods director Spike Lee.
