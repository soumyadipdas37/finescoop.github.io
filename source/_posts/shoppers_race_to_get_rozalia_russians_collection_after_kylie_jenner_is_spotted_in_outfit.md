Australian shoppers are racing to snap up fashion influencer Rozalia Russian's loungewear collection before they sell out after Kylie Jenner posted a photo in one of the comfortable tracksuits.

The makeup mogul and mother to Stormi Webster, 23, shared an image of herself on Instagram wearing the $139 oatmeal unisex tracksuit pants and matching $69 racerback tank from the Apparel by Rozalia x Atoir collection on Sunday. 

Captioning the snap 'weekend vibes' Kylie quickly accrued more than 7.3million likes, with both Rozalia and fashion label Atoir sharing the monumental moment on their own platforms.

The oatmeal tracksuit pants have sold out completely on the Atoir website, with pre-order now available for the next batch dropping in late September

'If this doesn't deserve a feed post I don't know what does... Kylie Jenner wearing Rozalia x Atoir oatmeal tracksuit and singlet today,' the Victorian social media mogul wrote.

The oatmeal tracksuit pants have sold out completely on the Atoir website, with pre-order now available for the next batch dropping in late September.

But customers can still snap up the singlet top in sizes six through to 14.  

The It girl, blogger and now-designer - who boasts an impressive 255,000 followers online - curated the line of loungewear in June, with the pieces selling out within 20 minutes of launching. 

The range is filled with neutral tracksuits, sweaters, tops and a trench coat, items that are perfectly suited to those still working from home.

Prices range from $69 to $160 for different-coloured separates and the colours include stylish white, black, grey, oatmeal and teal. 

'The work-from-home wardrobe is un-apologetically here to stay even as isolation eases,' Rozalia said of the collection.

'Our range takes you from Zoom meetings to at home weeknight dinners with friends and family and is a curated fashion-forward range that allows you to leave the house in style.'

The line is unisex and features a fashionable high crew neckline and flattering oversized fit.

There is still plenty of stock available online - as they have replenished outfits four times since June - and customers can pick up the same tracksuit in teal, black and white.
