He recently returned to the helm of Good Morning Britain following his Summer holiday break.

And Piers Morgan took a call from his daughter Elise, eight, during Wednesday's show as he wished her good luck as she returned to school.

The broadcaster, 55, jokingly ribbed colleague Susanna Reid, 49, during the call, as he mocked her for stating that it was the taking part that counted in the wake of their co-star Ranvir Singh's Strictly announcement.

As the programme returned from an ad break, Piers was seen chatting on his mobile phone, where he revealed he was catching up with his daughter.

He told the camera: 'Just speaking to my daughter live on air, wishing her good luck for her first day back at school, and all her friends.

While his co-host Susanna Reid chimed in: 'Good luck Elise!' 

Piers continued: 'She's good a message for Susanna: It's fine to have fun on things like Strictly, but actually, you've got to win. Quite right Elise'.

That's my girl: The broadcaster, 55, took a call from his daughter during the show as he wished her and her friends well as they went back to school

Susanna then snapped back: 'Well I wonder who taught you that, Elise?'

With Piers replying: 'She's been taught well.' 

As he continued to chat with his child, he added: 'So have fun, but win. Alright Elise, I've got to go, we're live on air. I'll talk to you later, bye.'

Confirming that Piers was indeed on a real phone call, Susanna explained: 'He genuinely is talking to his daughter by the way.'

While fellow presenter Ranvir Singh was heard saying: 'That is so sweet!' 

Susanna then referred back to her and Piers' earlier clash over Ranvir's unveiling as a new Strictly Come Dancing contestant which saw Piers insisting that she had to win, while Susanna argued that it was the taking part that counted. 

Susanna told Ranvir: 'Don't let Elise pile the pressure on you.'

With Piers adding: 'She's got three older brothers, it's all about winning.'

Earlier this month,  Piers joked his daughter Elise was channelling her inner Susanna Reid in a series of amusing snaps shared via Instagram.

Piers  looked on amused as his youngest child, who he shares with wife Celia Waldon, put on an animated display behind him.

The first photo saw both Elise and Piers smile brightly, before she wagged her finger at him angrily, and then pulled a funny face. 

Things then took a dramatic turn in the fourth snap as Elise pretended to throttle her dad as he put on a shocked expression for the camera.

Referring to his Good Morning Britain co-presenter, Piers wrote in the caption: 'Elise modelling her inner Susanna.'

Susanna seemed to enjoy the snaps very much, as she claimed Elise's interpretation of her was 'perfection.'

Earlier on during his trip, Piers ended up on crutches after tearing a tendon on the second day of his six-week family holiday.

The presenter shared a snap of himself using the crutches on Monday while stood alongside his sons Spencer, 26, Stanley, 22, and Albert, 19.

Alongside the photo, he wrote: 'Peg-leg. (nothing like tearing a tendon on Day 2 of a 6-week holiday) ⁦#StTropez'.
