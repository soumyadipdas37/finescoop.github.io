The jilted husband of Brad Pitt's new girlfriend Nicole Poturalski has been seen for the first time since she holidayed with the Hollywood heart-throb.

Dressed casually in a green linen shirt, blue jeans and white trainers, 68-year-old restaurateur Roland Mary was spotted at lunchtime today going into his Berlin eaterie Borchadt, where Brad and Nicole first met last August. 

Pitt, 56, sparked rumours of a romance with Angelina Jolie lookalike Nicole when he was spotted with her at France's Le Castellet Airport on Wednesday. 

Onlookers said the pair were behaving like 'lovestruck teenagers' as they couldn't keep their hands off each other at the airport - before flying to a smaller airport close to where they were staying last week at Château Miraval, the estate Pitt purchased for $67 million in 2011 with his ex-wife Angelina.

Blessed with a tall, athletic figure and striking features, the youngster was always interested in her appearance, her friend and former neighbour claimed. 'Nicole always wanted to be a fashion model, even as a young girl,' the friend told MailOnline

Mr Mary, who has been married several times, is said to be 'philosophical' about his wife's close relationship with the American big-screen legend.

The businessman is said to be in an 'open marriage' with his 27-year-old partner, with who he has a seven-year-old son, Emil.

Double Oscar winner Pitt was struck by Nicole's stunning figure and seductive pout when they were introduced last summer at the Berlin city centre restaurant.

The star was having dinner there while promoting his latest Tarrantino movie 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood' with the legendary director and co-stars Leonardo di Caprio and Margo Robbie.

Nicole is said to have passed Brad her phone number and they met up several weeks later when she was in Los Angeles for work.

'When Brad was at Borchadt, she [Nicole] gave him her number with a wink,' a friend of the couple who was at the restaurant that night told MailOnline. 

While Nicole's trip to Pitt's Chateau Miraval in the south of France last week came as a shock to the showbusiness world, it was not a surprise to Mr Mary.

Mr Mary has declined to discuss his wife's trip to France with star Pitt. He said simply, 'No comment'.

But the businessman who owns four restaurants in Berlin, including the celebrity haunt Borchadt, has told friends and family that the situation is 'normal'.

Cosy! Pitt and Nicole were pictured enjoying a cosy date nine months ago, as their relationship was confirmed on Thursday

'There is no tension between Roland and Nicole,' a friend of the family told MailOnline. 'Everything is fine.'

 Pitt has known Mr Mary for years, after becoming acquainted with Borchardt in 2009 when the star was filming on location in Germany for the Quentin Tarrantino movie 'Inglorious Bastards'.

And it was here that he first set eyes on Nicole, who bears a striking resemblance to his ex-wife Angelina Jolie.

'Brad first met Nicole in August last year at Borchardt which is her husband Roland's restaurant,' a friend of Nicole told MailOnline.

'Brad Pitt has been coming to Borchardt for years. He knows Roland and Nicole was at the restaurant when he came to celebrate his new film.

Double Oscar winner Pitt became acquainted with Borchardt and its owner Mr Mary (above) in 2009 when he was filming Quentin Tarantino's movie, 'Inglorious Basterds'

'Brad was introduced to Nicole and she passed him her number.

'Nicole travels a lot for her work as a fashion model and he connected with Brad Pitt while she was in LA for work.'   

Little is known about the nature of the beauty's friendship with Brad, but she frequently updates her 101,000 social media followers with sizzling snaps from her high-profile fashion shoots.

The model has graced the cover of ELLE and is currently signed to Next Management in Los Angeles and A Management in Germany.

Nicole, who enjoyed a sun-soaked trip to Ibiza last month, is based in Berlin where Mr Mary owns a number of other properties.

She has brains as well as beauty and her 10 years on the catwalks of the fashion world has helped her become multi-lingual and she can speak in five different languages.

Nicole comes from Bergkamen, Germany, which is in the old industrial Ruhr region and is of Polish heritage.

On her Facebook page, the fashion star, who is a favourite for British designer Vivienne Westwood, reveals she is single and listed her former city as Warsaw.

Her career has taken her to fashion shows in New York, Paris and Milan and she has been a cover girl for ELLE, Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire.

At 13, she wanted to be a marine biologist but was apparently spotted by a talent scout in Disneyland Paris and her parents agreed to allow her to model.

But talented and beautiful model still managed to complete her Abitur - German A levels - and founded an organisation devoted to helping sharks.

While she boasts a long list of accomplishments, the model is particularly proud of her son, Emil, who makes regular appearances on her Instagram account.

In February, Nicole raised eyebrows as she shared a cryptic post of herself strolling along Beverly Hills' upscale Rodeo Drive.

Captioning the image, which showed her flashing a broad smile while donning a black tank top and a denim miniskirt, she wrote: 'Missing my strolls with my Love.'

Several weeks later, in March, she alluded to her 'love' once again in another post.

Next to a snap of herself wearing grey lounge wear as she clutched a drinking glass, she wrote: 'Saturdays these days for me is self reflection, reading books spending time with my better half.'

While she shared the posts with candid accompanying captions, Nicole didn't name or tag the person in question.

When contacted by MailOnline, a representative for Brad Pitt said: 'We don't comment on personal relationships.'

MailOnline has contacted Nicole Poturalski's representatives for further comment.
