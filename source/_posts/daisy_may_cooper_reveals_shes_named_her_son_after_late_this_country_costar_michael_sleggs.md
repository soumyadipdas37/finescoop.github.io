Daisy May Cooper paid tribute to her late co-star Michael Sleggs when naming her newborn. 

The This Country star, 34, welcomed a baby boy on September 1 but remained in hospital for a 'traumatic few days' after suffering complications in labour. 

In a sweet Instagram post on Friday, the actress revealed all was now well as she announced the name of her little one.

Just a couple of months prior, in May, Michael revealed he was terminally ill following a 'fairly rapid' deterioration, later clarifying he was suffering from heart failure. 

He had played Michael 'Slugs' Slugette on the BBC Three sitcom This Country alongside Daisy, who plays Kerry Mucklowe.    

The show follows the daily exploits of best friends Kerry and Kurtan in rural England.
