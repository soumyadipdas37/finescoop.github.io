A woman has been ordered to pay $54,000 in damages after posting nude photos of her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend on Facebook and calling her a 'fat wh**e'. 

Canberra woman Jay Gill went on an online and real-life rampage of harassment against with her partner's ex, sharing pictures of her online before chasing her around a supermarket.

Gill distributed 'revenge porn' pictures of the woman, who cannot be named, through Facebook Messenger to at least 80 people in November 2017.

The woman had sent the 'tit pic' to her former partner while they were together thinking no one else would see it, Canberra Star reports.

When Gill sent the photo to other people she also sent a message saying the woman was a 'fat wh**e with her ugly nipple hanging out'.

Friends who saw the photo contacted the victim, including her butcher who asked if the woman knew there was a 'nude pic of you doing the rounds'.  

The victim told a hearing earlier this month that she was so horrified her butcher had seen the photos that she has not returned to his business since. 

A stranger also messaged the woman saying: 'Hey I don’t even know you, but thought you might like to know Jay Kingsley is sending nude pictures of your tits to me! No idea why!'

Chief Magistrate Lorainne Walker said Gill then continued to post a 'running commentary of irrational vitriol' about the woman that turned into a 'public scandal'.

The woman sued for defamation and argued both the image and messages had damaged her reputation as it portrayed her as a 'wh**e and sl*t'.

Ms Walker agreed that the online posts had portrayed the victim as 'a fat whore, a slut, neglectful of her children, an unfit mother and a person who bore children by different men in order to exploit the welfare system'.  

Gill attempted to fight the defamation and argued sharing the image was 'trivial' and was unlikely to cause the woman harm as her comments were 'honest opinion'.

She was briefly jailed in 2019 for threatening to kill the woman after continuously threatening her in public.

In one instance, Gill chased the woman and one of her four children around a supermarket yelling: 'fat wh**e, I'm gonna kill you'.

The woman said the treatment by Gill and the photo being made public had made her anxious, withdrawn and paranoid.

She had trouble sleeping and had also been prescribed medication for her anxiety.

Magistrate Walker said Gill's harassment was 'inherently quite vile' and awarded the victim $54,000 for defamation that Gill will have to payout.
