Jody Morris and Chelsea's coaching staff aren't the only influences on Frank Lampard's management, with the Blues boss admitting he consults his wife over players' 'life issues'.

The Englishman took on his first Premier League season in only his second term as a manager in 2019-20, impressing under the Stamford Bridge pressure to finish fourth and reach the FA Cup final. 

The Blues icon is continuing to learn quickly in the dugout and has experience playing under some of the world's top bosses to pull from - but Lampard has revealed his wife Christine is a crucial sounding board for his man-management. 

Frank Lampard has revealed his wife Christine helps him deal with his players's personalities

The pair have been married since 2015, with Christine a famous TV presenter working on ITV

Lampard impressed in his first season back at Chelsea as a young boss but is still learning 

'I do throw a lot of things off Christine,' the legendary former midfielder said. 

'She's not picking what full-back we're going to play that weekend but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues - and actually football issues sometimes - I can definitely go home.'  

'I go, "Christine, what do you think about this problem: I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday. But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?''' 

Lampard revealed that Christine helps him understand players' issues in their personal lives

'And she goes: "Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them."

'So she's not my life coach as such, but I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'

Christine, who married Lampard in 2015 during his breif Manchester City spell, is a high-profile TV presenter, currently appearing on ITV's Loose Women.
