A teenage baker described as a 'one-in-a-million star' by Instagram's co-founder has shared his three-step recipe for chocolate brownies - and it's so simple, anyone can make them.

Morgan Hipworth is the founder of Bistro Morgan, a boutique bakery five kilometres southeast of Melbourne CBD where he spends hours in the kitchen developing exciting new pastries and desserts for local customers. 

In a recent Instagram video, the 19-year-old showed viewers how to make his 'ultimate chocolate brownies', which have chocolate chip cookie dough base covered with a top layer of rich brownie batter.

To make the brownies - which he calls a 'chocolate lover's dream' - Mr Hipworth uses half a cup of melted butter, half a cup of cocoa powder, one cup of sugar, two eggs, half a cup of all-purpose flour and a quarter cup of chocolate chips.

Teenage baker Morgan Hipworth's 'ultimate chocolate brownies', which can be made from supermarket ingredients in three simple steps

He starts by pressing ready-made cookie dough into the base of a greased baking dish.

One of the best-selling brands in Australia is Aunty Kath's $4.80 rolled cookie dough, which is available from leading supermarket like Coles and Woolworths. 

Getting started on the brownie batter, Mr Hipworth loads all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and whisks until smooth and thick.

Then he spoons the mixture over the cookie dough and bakes it in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes until soft and gooey - it's really that simple.

Delighted followers quickly flooded the comments section with messages like 'mate, you are awesome', 'this makes me so hungry' and 'I'm making these tonight.

One fan who has already tried the recipe confirmed the brownies 'taste like heaven'.

'Oh my goodness gracious me, I'm hitting diabetic coma watching this (totally going to make it immediately),' a woman replied.

One man described the brownies as 'sugar on sugar' and declared he is 'honestly living for it', while another said he would ask his mother to make him a batch immediately.

No stranger to public praise, Morgan Hipworth has been over achieving for most of his life. 

Some of the mouth-watering treats stocked at Bistro Morgan, a booming bakery opened by teenage businessman Morgan Hipworth in 2016

One year before opening his bakery in 2016, the then 14-year-old was busy supplying his signature doughnuts to 15 Melbourne cafes on weekends.

His flavour creations included a Gaytime Crunch inspired by the popular ice cream, Coco Pops, Lotus Biscoff and Red Velvet, all of which he stocks at Bistro Morgan today.

The hard-working youngster was once hailed as a 'one-in-a-million star' by Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, who said 'it's because of entrepreneurs like Morgan' that the photo sharing platform has become so successful.
