A British teenager has been stabbed to death in a Spanish holiday resort.

Andrew Milroy died from a single stab wound to the chest in Lloret de Mar during the early hours of yesterday morning.

Police are thought to be hunting a gang of French youths of north African origin Andrew is said to have had an altercation with.

The killing happened in the shopping centre of Lloret de Mar during the early hours of Sunday morning

His mother Jackie, originally from Richmond, Surrey, has spoken of her devastation.

She runs American diner, called Route 66, in the Costa Brave resort with her husband, Andy.

Mrs Milroy, who emigrated to Spain 26-years-ago, said: 'I can't think straight at all, I'm just in so much shock.

'We haven't spoken to the police yet so we don't really know what happened.

'I'm hoping things will become a bit clearer later.

'All we do know they're still looking for the person who killed my son.'

Andrew, who was born in Spain, was attacked around 4am in Lloret's central shopping district.

A nearby hotel security guard called police after being alerted by the boy's friends.

Ambulance workers found him lying in a pool of blood in an alleyway by a clothes shop.

He died after being rushed to Sant Jaume Hospital in the nearby town of Blanes, 40 minutes drive north of Barcelona.

A post-mortem was due to be carried out later today.

A spokesman for the Mossos d'Esquadra, the local police force investigating the crime, said: 'An investigating judge has imposed a secrecy order over the case which prevents us from going into detail about what happened.

'All we can confirm is that a British 15-year-old who lives in Lloret de Mar was stabbed to death in the town around 4am on Sunday morning.

'An investigation is underway. There have been no arrests yet.'

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Madrid added: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Lloret de Mar and we are offering consular assistance to his family.'

Tragic Andrew was born in Spain and attended a local school called Inmalucada Concepcion.

A friend left a Twitter message which read simply, 'Rest in peace Andrew.'

His parents used to run a pub popular with ex-pats and holidaymakers in the resort called Sergeant Peppers Fun Pub.

They also had a bar called Braveheart's International Pub before opening their current business.

The stabbing was the third involving a British youngsters in the past week in Spain.

Another British teenager was rushed to hospital last Wednesday after being stabbed in the groin.
