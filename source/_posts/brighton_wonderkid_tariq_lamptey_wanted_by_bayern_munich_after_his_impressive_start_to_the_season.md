Tariq Lamptey is a target for Bayern Munich but the Champions League holders are almost £10million short of Brighton's asking price, according to reports in Germany.

Right-back Lamptey, 19, has made a brilliant start to the 2020/21 Premier League season and is being lined up as back-up to Benjamin Pavard for Hansi Flick's side.

But according to German outlet SPORT1, Bayern offered just £14m to the Seagulls, who are demanding a fee closer to £23m.

Lamptey has been impressive and was good against Marcus Rashford's Manchester United

Moreover, last season's treble winners will have to act fast with the window closing on October 5 and with reported first-choice target Sergino Dest closing in on a move to Barcelona.

Lamptey has quickly become a permanent fixture in Graham Potter's side despite having only made the move to the seaside club from their Stamford Bridge counterparts for £4m in January.

The Brighton wonderkid left Chelsea's Under-23 set-up to join the first-team squad at the Amex and his lightning displays have turned heads around the Premier League.

Lamptey already has three assists to his name this campaign, including one against his former club in their first game of the new top-flight season by setting up Leandro Trossard in the Seagulls' 3-1 defeat.

However, the news of Bayern Munich's interest in him comes a day after Sportsmail revealed the German side are considering a move for Norwich City right-back Max Aarons.

Barcelona had also approached Norwich over a deal for Aarons but their offer of a loan with the option to buy for £20million was rejected with the Championship side demanding a guaranteed fee.

Bayern had hoped to sign Barcelona-bound Dest but have always had Aarons on their list of options and are weighing up an offer.

The 20-year-old Aarons also has interest from Roma and AC Milan who have been discussing figures with Tottenham for Serge Aurier.
