She's been busy filling in for Simon Cowell as head judge on Britain's Got Talent.

And Amanda Holden got to have some much needed relaxation time as she enjoyed a romantic getaway to Cliveden House in Berkshire this weekend.

The TV presenter, 49, put on a very loved-up display with her husband Chris Hughes during the trip before sharing a sizzling selfie of her lounging in lace while in bed.

Amanda exuded glamour as she relaxed in a white dressing gown over a black lacy top while reading a book fittingly called The Mistresses Of Cliveden.

The blonde beauty wore her locks down for the sultry snap and added a slick of pink lipgloss as well as some smokey eyeshadow.

Elsewhere on the trip, Amanda and Chris appeared to enjoy the good weather as she planted a tender kiss on his cheek in a sun-soaked selfie. 

Amanda also shared a black-and-white snap to her Instagram grid, showing her resting against a car while flaunting her toned limbs in white shorts.

The star put on a busty display in the glamorous snap in a low-cut ruffled top which boasted puff sleeves and tied in a statement bow at the waist.

She also shared pictures of a generously sized glass of bubbles while inside one of the luxury 376-acre country estate's gorgeous rooms. 

Taking to Instagram on Sunday, Amanda said: 'Had the best #romantic #weekend with #Chrispy in this historic and infamous place steeeeped in history.

'Thank you to all the staff for looking after us so well... NOT an #ad ( thanks to John on the door for humouring me by taking this pic early this morning)'

Having a great time: She thanked the Cliveden house staff for their hospitality on Instagram on Sunday

Cliveden house is a popular spot for celebs and has hosted an array of famous faces over the years including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charlie Chaplin.

The property, once owned by William Waldorf Astor, was also the hotel where Meghan Markle stayed the night before her wedding to Price Harry in 2018.

Amanda's trip comes after she teamed up with West End superstar Sheridan Smith for a duet of the hit song I Know Him So Well.

The single is the latest musical offering from Amanda's album, Songs From My Heart, which will be released on October 2.

The tune and accompanying video is a cover of a song from Chess The Musical and was released on Friday.  

In black and white stills from the music video, Amanda and Sheridan, 39, look as though they are having lots of fun as they giggle while in the recording studio.  

Amanda said: 'I got a great friendship out of this song in Sheridan Smith. I’d loved her for years and we’ve always hugged when we met but we didn’t know each other.

'I really wanted her to duet with me on I Know Him So Well so I asked David Walliams for her number.

'She was heavily pregnant, but she couldn’t have been nicer or more enthusiastic when I called her, and the final result is better than I even imagined.'

She continued: 'This is also the first single I ever bought for my mum who loved Barbara Dickson. We had all her albums and even though I have never to this day seen Chess, this is the song I’ve always loved.'

Family has always been at the heart of Amanda's music

The idea to create an album came about after Amanda and her daughters recorded Tightrope (from The Greatest Showman) for her husband to mark their 10th wedding anniversary in 2018. 

Amanda and Chris tied the knot in 2008 at Babington House, Somerset, two years after welcoming their first child. They are parents to daughters Alexa and Hollie.
