Brian Austin Green appears to be back on with his former fling Tina Louise.

The 90210 star recently hinted in an interview that he would 'never say never' to reuniting with estranged wife Megan Fox, despite the fact that she has moved on with her rapper boyfriend Machine Gun Kelly.

However, Brian, 47, only had eyes for tattooed model Tina, 39, as the pair were pictured stripped down to their bathing suits for a beach day in Los Angeles on Monday.

Brian reportedly split with Tina at the end of July after a month of dating, and he has since caused controversy with former wife Megan, 34, by mocking her gushy social media posts with her new 30-year-old rapper boyfriend, whose real name is Colson Baker.

During their beach outing, Brian could barely keep his eyes off the stunning model, as she showed off her incredible physique in a bikini. 

The sighting comes just days after Brian told his Instagram followers he would 'never say never' about getting back together with Megan.

She's a knockout! Tina Louise is providing a welcome distraction for Brian, who appears to have an issue with his ex wife Megan Fox moving on so swiftly since their split

'I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together, and you see eye to eye and then sometimes those paths do different things,' he said during an Instagram Live on Saturday.

'We shared a lot together and we really went through a lot together,' he added of Fox, who started dating rapper Colson less than a month after their split. 'At some point I think our paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other.' 

However, last month, trouble started when Megan posted a sexy mirror selfie of herself and Colson with the caption: 'Achingly Beautiful Boy... My heart is yours.' 

The public display of affection appeared to be too much for her ex Brian, who threw shade just hours later by posting a snap of their three sons with the similar caption: 'Achingly beautiful boys..... my heart is yours.'

His controversial clap back certainly got fans talking, as one user commented: 'Ha! Brian the shade in your caption is too much... I love it,' while another said: 'I see what you did there.'

The actor had previously maintained that the pair had an amicable split, yet since then, Megan's relationship with Kelly has moved at considerable speed. 

Brian and Megan share three children together Bodhi, six, Journey, four, and Noah, seven, while he also has another son Kassius, 18, - who features in his post - from his previous relationship with actress Vanessa Marcil.

The pair filed for divorce after 11 years of marriage citing 'irreconcilable differences' in May this year. 

Following the split, Brian spoke out to say it had nothing to do with 'cheating' and insisted that she and Kelly were just 'friends' despite them sharing racy scenes from the rapper's music video. 

Speaking on his podcast, Brian said: 'I've never met [Machine Gun Kelly], but Megan and I talked about him and they're friends at this point. And from what she's expressed, he's a really just nice, genuine guy. I trust her judgment. She's always had really good judgment.'

However, in July, Megan appeared to reveal that the pair were more than just friends as she confessed she 'knew' something would happen between them before they'd even met. 

'I was like, "Who is going to play this role?" And he was like, "Oh, we just got Machine Gun Kelly," and immediately, I was like, "Uh oh,"' Megan recalled on the podcast Give Them Lala... With Randall. 

'Because I knew - I could feel that some wild s**t was going to happen to me from that meeting, but I wasn't yet sure what,' she added.

'I just felt it like, deep in my soul - that something was going to come from that. So then, we met on set.'

The Transformers star even went so far as to say, she could see something akin to a soul mate in the rapper, or what she calls a 'twin flame.'
