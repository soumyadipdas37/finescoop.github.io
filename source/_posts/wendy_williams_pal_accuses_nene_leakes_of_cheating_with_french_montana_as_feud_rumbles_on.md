The bad blood between Real Housewives Of Atlanta's Nene Leakes and talk show host Wendy Williams shows no sign of abating.

On Tuesday, William's best friend Madina Milana tore a strip out of Leakes in an Instagram post which she accused the reality star of cheating on her husband Gregg with rapper French Montana.

Leakes responded on her own Instagram on Wednesday by posting a photo of herself looking at her phone with the caption: 'John Doe wit all these liessssss! Say what now!?!? i can’t' and adding laughing-crying emojis.

Bad blood: Wendy William's pal Madina Milana has jumped into the war of words between the talk show host and RHOA star Nene Leakes in a bid to defend the daytime TV personality 

Huh: Leakes responded on her own Instagram Wednesday by posting a photo of herself looking at her phone with caption: 'John Doe wit all these liessssss! Say what now!?!? i can’t' 

In her Instagram clip, Milana, whose known Williams for the best part of two decades and has worked on her TV show, accused Leakes of using Williams for fame.

'Ok NeNe, we gonna stop with these lies. We gonna stop with these games,' she began. 'You snuck your way back into Wendy’s life. You tricked me. Y’all asked me to have a sit down, ask her to come to dinner. Which I did. Your thirsty a** flew on the plane the next day.'

'Why? So you can be mean and evil and try and come back into her life. And use her and lie on her.'

Threat: Milana alleged Leakes had cheated on her husband by hooking up with rapper French Montana and warned more damaging stuff would come out if she kept attacking Williams

Allegation: 'Why don’t you talk about the part where when we was in the truck, you was letting French touch all up on your ******. That’s right. A whole married woman, NeNe,' Milana said

Milana then went on to allege Leakes had hooked up with Montana.

'Why don’t you talk about the part where when we was in the truck, you was letting French touch all up on your ******. That’s right. You was all up under French Montana. A whole married woman, NeNe.'

She then said: 'What I’m gonna tell you is this. You better fall all the way back and keep everyone’s name out your mouth. If you keep coming for people that’s what’s gonna happen. It’s gonna be more stuff aired out, more receipts shown. And I don’t think you want that smoke boo. So fall back.'

Leakes clearly took it all in stride, even posting a snap of herself searching in her purse and writing: 'Looking for this damn Kat that @frenchmontana done SNATCHEDDDDDD. GOT to dig deeper Chile.'

Daily Mail has reached out to French Montana and to Nene Leakes for comment. 

Funny: Leakes clearly took it all in stride, even posting a snap of herself searching in her purse and writing: 'Looking for this damn Kat that @frenchmontana done SNATCHEDDDDDD'

Unhappy: Nene had called out Williams and Bravo's Andy Cohen after they dissed her departure from Real Housewives Of Atlanta on Watch What Happens Live  on Sunday

Following Williams' appearance with Andy Cohen on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live on Sunday night, Leakes blasted the daytime TV personality for saying she'd made a bad decision to exit Real Housewives Of Atlanta after 12 seasons.

'She does Andy Cohen's show and, here, she sits speaking negatively of my exit and bringing my family into the equation,' Leakes, 52, said of her pal's betrayal. 

Speaking directly to Williams in the Instagram video, she added: 'Now that's what you're not gonna do, Wendy.'

Williams had described Leakes as a drama queen who likes attention in her WWHL appearance and was dismissive of any reality show spin-offs Leakes might be planning to do in the future. 

'Is it going to be Nene being a grandmother? That's boring. Nene and her own kids? That's boring. Nene trying to figure out Hollywood? That's boring,' she deadpanned.

Stirring the pot: Williams had described Leakes as a drama queen who likes attention in her WWHL appearance and was dismissive of any reality show spin-offs Leakes might be planning 

Had been close: 'She does Andy Cohen's show and here she sits speaking negatively of my exit and bringing my family into the equation,' Leakes said of Williams' betrayal 

At loggerheads: 'Stop bringing up my name on your show to help your ratings,' Leakes told Bravo honcho Cohen. 'You've been forcing me out for the last four years' 

In her video response, Leakes asked Bravo honcho Cohen to cease saying anything that isn't 'positive' after maintaining a professional relationship for more than a decade.  

'Stop bringing up my name on your show to help your ratings,' Leakes continued. 'You didn't want me here. You've been forcing me out for the last four years.'

She remarked: 'There's no reason why you need to keep bringing me up and talking so negatively of me.'   

Addressing Williams and Cohen, she slammed them of 'poking the bear over and over again.'

In a series of tweets, Leakes also accused them of using her to try and shore up the poor ratings for both their shows.  

Nene first announced that she was done with the Real Housewives Of Atlanta in a YouTube video on September 17, after undergoing 'exhausting' and 'emotional negotiations with the network. 



Contract talks: Leakes announced she was leaving RHOA after 12 seasons and questioned why she wasn't treated on a par with her white Housewives counterparts
