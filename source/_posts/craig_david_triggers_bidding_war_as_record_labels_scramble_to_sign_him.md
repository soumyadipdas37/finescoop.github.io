He's one of the UK's most successful male recording artists, having bagged 20 Top 40 singles and seven Top 40 albums as well as numerous awards throughout his 20 year career.

And it appears that Craig David is still in high demand as he's reportedly sparked a huge bidding war between record labels who are desperate to sign him.

The 7 Days hitmaker, 39, who's debut album Born To Do it was released 20 years ago, made a huge chart comeback in recent years, with record bosses apparently keen to cash in on his success.

Craig made a phenomenal chart resurgence in 2015 and has since gone on to score six Top 40 singles as well as two successful albums which reached No1 and No2 in the charts.

The Sun reports that he has now completed his two album deal with record label Insanity and is now back on the market ahead of his next album.

A source told the publication: 'Craig was blown away by the reaction to his comeback. But he felt like he wanted a change of tack after completing the deal with his last label.

'He’s working on a new album now which he plans to release next year and is exploring exciting options on who to work with for it.

'Craig is a free agent at the moment and all of the major record labels have shown interest.' 

The insider went on to say that the vocalist is in a position to negotiate the 'best deal' and could even demand a 'seven-figure fee' given at how well he has done of late. 

MailOnline have contacted representatives of Craig for comment.

Craig was forced to cancel his 2020 tour due to the pandemic and has rescheduled the shows for 2021. 

Speaking during a recent appearance on Lorraine, Craig revealed that he has made some of his music available for free to tide his fans over until he's back on stage. 

He said: 'It took me a moment, I needed to observe and see what was going on before I could help people. I wanted to put music up for free on my Instagram.

'I was reaching out to songwriters and saying, "If you’re OK, can I put this music out today now?"

'People need the healing of music now, not in two, three weeks’ time. We need things to slightly take our minds off of what’s going on.'

Craig added that he feels like he is a child making music in his room all over again during lockdown.

He said: 'I feel like a kid again. Everything I did in my mum’s flat I’m doing again. It’s going across the whole country but I was like, "I’m in control of this like I was back in the day in my room making CDs. I think artists are feeling control again."'
