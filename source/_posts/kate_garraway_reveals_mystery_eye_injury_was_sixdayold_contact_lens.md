Kate Garraway has revealed she 'baffled' nurses when they pulled out a six-day-old contact lens on Thursday, after ending up in hospital with a mystery eye injury.

The presenter, 53, admitted she felt 'embarrassed' as she told her story to Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins on Good Morning Britain on Friday.

Kate had complained of an injury to her eye during her Smooth Radio show on Wednesday and had to wear glasses because she couldn't read the headlines when presenting GMB the next day.

Charlotte, 45, asked: 'How are you, are you ok?' 

To which Kate replied: 'Well Charlotte, I'm so glad you asked because everyone has been gripped by this. It turned out to be an extraordinary medical problem. 

'I went to a brilliant eye hospital in London yesterday and a team of eye nurses were baffled, absolutely baffled. Then eventually, after having drops, they found it was actually a contact lens stuck up in top of my eye that's been in there for about six days.'

Oops: Charlotte, 45, asked: 'How are you?' Kate replied: 'Well Charlotte, I'm so glad you asked everyone has been gripped by this. It turned out to be an extraordinary medical problem'

Ben asked Kate: 'Was it a whole lens or just a bit?'

'Just a little bit, what happened was I thought I had taken it out, but there was a sneaky bit in there remaining. I felt a little bit embarrassed because I'd taken up other peoples' time just by root cause untidiness.'  

It comes after Kate had to wear glasses on Thursday's Good Morning Britain and told viewers she was having trouble reading the morning headlines.

Stunned: 'I went to a brilliant eye hospital in London yesterday and a team of eye nurses were baffled, absolutely baffled'

Oh dear: 'Then eventually, after having drops, they found it was actually a contact lens stuck up in top of my eye that's been in there for about six days'

Speaking on the breakfast show, she said: 'Let's have a look at the front pages now, if that is, I can see them. If you haven't noticed [the glasses]... I've injured my eye.

'I don't know what I've done to it, but I'm going to get it checked out today. But it means it's all a bit of a lottery at the moment as to whether I can read anything.'

Kate was joined by co-hosts Ben and Susanna Reid, but caused a bit of 'glasses envy' with 49-year-old Susanna.

Speaking on Friday, she said: 'It's been a tough week for Derek actually, a tough week.'

Ben replied: 'Really?', while Lorraine Kelly, who they went to talk to shortly after said: 'Sorry it's been a rough week, but it’s been lovely having you on the telly.'
