She has been celebrating her two-year anniversary with her husband Alex Bowen. 

And Olivia Bowen looked sensational in a plunging silk crop top as she stepped out with her beau for dinner in London on Tuesday. 

The former Love Island star, 26, put on a loved-up display with Alex as the pair arrived holding hands at the restaurant while they continued their celebrations. 

Wow: Olivia Bowen, 26, looked sensational in a plunging silk crop top as she stepped out with her beau for dinner in London on Tuesday

The TV personality looked every inch the star in the sleeved cream top which accentuated her ample assets and showcased her incredibly-toned abs. 

Olivia paired the top with high-waisted nude trousers which sculpted her hourglass figure and draped effortlessly over her patent court shoes. 

The reality star wore her signature blonde tresses in loose waves and added glam to her look with mascara on her fluttery eyelashes and a slick of nude lipstick.

Finishing her look, Olivia toted a nude Balenciaga bag for her evening essentials and added a simple silver necklace with a pearl pendant. 

Meanwhile Alex, 29, looked smart in tailored black trousers with a round-neck t-shirt and draped a grey collared jacket over his shoulders for the occasion.     

Olivia has been celebrating two years of marriage with husband Alex this week, with the pair dining at London's Scott's on Tuesday and STK the following evening.

The lovebirds also pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.

Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together. 

The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance.

When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.

'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.

'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.

'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.'
