She is currently undergoing hotel quarantine in Queensland after relocating with her family for work opportunities.

And on Wednesday, Nikki Osborne revealed the X-rated joke her family played on her.

The comedian, 39, shared a video on Instagram showing that she received a package that read: '1x disposable dildo.'

'My family up here have a good sense of humour,' she said, adding that: 'the police weren't sure if they should deliver this.' 

She giggled as she revealed the package contained a banana - and not a sex toy. 

'Gotta love family dropping off "care packages" to the hotel,' Nikki wrote in the caption.

Last week, she revealed to The Courier Sun that she and her family would be relocating from Melbourne to Brisbane because the of Stage Four restrictions in Victoria. 

Nikki, who was raised in Queensland and has lived in Victoria for 15 years, had her national comedy tour cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

'It's really depressing down here,' she told the publication on Saturday.

'All our friends' businesses are going bust and all my industry mates can't work... it's depressing watching your kids staring at a screen or a wall,' she told the publication.

'Melbourne has always been the comedy hub. But that’s all turned on its head. Now it’s actually been wonderful for me because I can justify living in Queensland and that be good for employment.'

Nikki, her husband Jamie Starr and their two children are currently a few days into their two weeks in mandatory hotel quarantine, and from there she hopes to secure work on productions in Queensland.
