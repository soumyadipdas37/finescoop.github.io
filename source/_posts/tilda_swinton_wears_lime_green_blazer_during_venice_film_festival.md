Tilda teamed her bright jacket with satin tracksuit trousers and purple loafers, with the finishing touch a pair of purple statement shades.

She also made sure to slip on a face mask as she made her way through the crowds to her first stop of the day. 

Earlier in the week Tilda honoured the late actor Chadwick Boseman as she accepted an award at the festival by proclaiming 'Wakanda forever' on stage.

The 59-year-old was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award and proudly held her coveted trophy aloft after receiving the honour at the opening ceremony from Cate Blanchett, who heads this year's jury.

At the end of her acceptance speech, Tilda gave a nod to her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe star Chadwick as she said: 'Viva Venezia. Cinema cinema cinema. Wakanda Forever. Nothing but love'. 

Tilda portrayed The Ancient One in Doctor Strange and Avengers: Endgame while Chadwick starred as T’Challa/Black Panther in the 2018 blockbuster Black Panther, which is set in the fictional country of Wakanda.

Chadwick tragically passed away on August 28 following a four-year battle with colon cancer.

Also in her speech, Tilda said: 'Cinema is my happy place, my true motherland. Its fellowship is my heart’s family tree. 

'The names on the list of those awarded this honor, meanwhile, they are the names of my masters. They’re the elders of my tribe. 

'The poets of the language I love above others. I sing their songs in the bath. I’m the punk kid film nut hitching a ride to the station to get to the foothills of the heights of their achievements.'

Another stylish star: French actress Stacy Martin was also pictured at the hotel, wowing in a short black mini dress and statenment boots

New project: Actress Mahdieh Nassaj arrived at the festival photocall for her new movie The Wasteland on Thursday

Tilda looked elated as she was handed the famous Golden Lion prize, as the 77th annual festival kicked off in socially distanced style.

When it was announced over the summer that Tilda would be receiving the award, she said in a statement: 'This great festival has been dear to my heart for three decades: to be honoured by her in this way is extremely humbling.

'To come to Venice, this year of all years, to celebrate immortal cinema and her defiant survival in the face of all the challenges that evolution might throw at her – as at us all – will be my sincere joy.'
