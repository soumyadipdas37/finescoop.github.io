Model Cheyenne Tozzi, 31, has spoken about her actress sister Tahnya's heartbreaking struggles to become pregnant with Studio 10 host husband Tristan MacManus.

 Cheyenne, who is a mother-of-one herself, revealed she's been supporting Tahnya, 34, during what has been an extremely difficult time for her family.

Sydney-based Cheynne, recalled a heartbreaking phonecall she'd previously had with Tahnya (who was at the time based in Melbourne) about her sister's pregnancy woes.  

Of the conversation, Cheyenne recalled: 'I could hear in her voice how much she was struggling. Certain traumas in our lives have brought us closer together.' 

Cheyenne said she 'jumped straight on a plane to be there for her' after the emotional call.

'I'm so proud of her, and proud that in her darkest moments she was able to turn that into something positive to try to help others,' Cheyenne said of her sister's project.

Tahyna has since welcomed three children with her Irish dancer husband who she wed in 2014.
