A woman was allegedly savagely stabbed while she was out jogging in broad daylight in a quiet Melbourne street.

The woman in her 20s was jogging near Primula Boulevard in Gowanbrae about 10.20am on Thursday when she was allegedly attacked and stabbed, police said.

She suffered injuries to her back and hand and was rushed to Royal Melbourne Hospital where she underwent surgery. She remains in a stable condition. 

The woman in her 20s was jogging near Primula Boulevard in Gowanbrae (pictured) about 10.20am on Thursday when she was allegedly attacked and stabbed, police said 

Following a police investigation, detectives executed a search warrant at a Gowanbrae home where they arrested an 18-year-old man. 

He was then charged with intentionally causing serious injury, stalking, assault with weapon, assault with intent to commit sexual assault and common law assault. 

The man was also charged in relation to another reported sexual assault on the same walking path which occurred on April 7.

He was remanded in custody overnight and is due to appear in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Friday.
