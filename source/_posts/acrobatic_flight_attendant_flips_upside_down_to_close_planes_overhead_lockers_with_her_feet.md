This is the impressive moment a flight attendant shows off her remarkable acrobatic skills to close the overhead lockers with her feet - while wearing high heels.

Lindsey O'Brien, 35, gripped onto the armrests before flipping upside down and using her feet to close four luggage containers above.

She twirled back down to the aisle and lifted her arms in triumph as her fellow crew members cheered her on.

The video was filmed in June aboard an aircraft which had been grounded in her home city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, due to Covid-19.

Lindsey, who has been a flight attendant for six and a half years, said: 'We were on the ground in between flights and my friend wanted to try the move.

'I used to do yoga and I was a cheerleader growing up so my core is pretty strong and I had to see if I could do it.'

In the video, Lindsey can be seen placing her hands on the seats either side of the aisle before turning herself upside down.

She then proceeds to shut the overhead compartments with her feet before returning to a standing position in the middle of the aisle, much to the delight of her colleagues. 

Lindsey, who has asked that we do not reveal the airline she works for, admitted that it took about 20 tries to get the perfect take.

'Every time I did it one bin wouldn't close, we wanted me to close four at once.'

Lindsey, pictured, has been a flight attendant for six and a half years and says it took 20 tries 

She added that the video was a welcome relief from the strain of working as a flight attendant during a pandemic.

'This was one of those times when we were trying to make the best of a crazy situation.

'We always wear our masks when we are around passengers and at airports and this was just a rare occasion when we could kick back and just have some fun.

'I don't even remember what airport we were at.'
