A white woman has landed herself in hot water with indigenous advocates after buying a didgeridoo for her partner for Father's Day. 

Social media influencer Sarah Stevenson, known by her one million followers as Sarah's Day, gave her partner Kurt Tilse the wind instrument as a gift from their one-year-old son Fox on Sunday.

The father shared a photo on Instagram of him playing the didgeridoo, also known as the Yadaki by some Aboriginal communities, for his son at their Sydney home.

'Thanks mate, such a great Fathers Day gift! What a special gift rich with so much culture,' Tilse wrote.

'I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Dharawal speaking people who are the Traditional Custodians of the Sutherland Shire.'

But the post caught the attention of Indigenous advocates and followers who accused the couple of cultural appropriation, decrying the gift as 'inappropriate and disrespectful'. 

'I wish this was a picture of you reading an Indigenous children’s book to your son. So many ways to appreciate First Nation’s culture that isn’t appropriation,' one woman wrote. 

Another added:'So disappointing.'  

Sharing the image on their Instagram page, educational Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander group @blakbusiness slammed the pair for purchasing the Yadaki from a non-Indigenous seller. 

'Non-Indigenous people owning or profiting from our culture is very problematic as it reflects a history of carpet-bagging and takes economic opportunities away from our mob,' the post read.

The group also shared images of comments they wrote addressing their concerns on the photo, that they claim were later deleted. 

'Turning off comments is silencing Aboriginal voices and perspectives,' they wrote to the couple.

It is not the first time the fitness blogger has come under fire. 

In May, the Youtuber was blasted with complaints, including death threats, for cultural appropriation after she appeared in a promotional video for her new active wear range with colourful split braids. 

She promptly issued an apology video saying she was unaware the hairstyle had cultural links to the black community and would not have used it had she known.  

Other photos shared by @blakbusiness on Monday showed messages the group had sent her following the first incident offering to educate her on cultural appropriation, that Stevenson never returned. 

Tilse responded by defending the purchase in his Instagram story, writing his intentions had been misinterpreted.

'I only want to glorify the rich culture that is attached to this country and the land,' he wrote. 

'I am proud to be Australian and want to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land.' 

Instagram page @blakbusiness shared a comment the group wrote on the photo, claiming several of their comments had been deleted

Cultural appropriation is the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society. 

The Instagram star also copped criticism last November during an attempt to raise money for bushfire victims.

The 27-year-old announced she would donate $1 from every product she sold, sparking outrage from scores of her more than 2million fans who thought the small percentage was a 'cop out'.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sarah Stevenson and @blakbusiness for comment.
