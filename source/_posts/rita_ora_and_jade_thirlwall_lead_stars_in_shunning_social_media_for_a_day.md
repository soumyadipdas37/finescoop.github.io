Rita Ora and Jade Thirlwall have joined a slew of stars vowing to ditch social media for Digital Detox Day. 

The Hot Right Now hitmaker, 29, and Little Mix singer, 27, took to Instagram on Friday to reveal they'd be backing the campaign, which will see stars taking a break from their accounts on Saturday to raise awareness of mental health.

The campaign has been promoted by YouTube star Zoe Sugg and Rizzle Kicks' Jordan Stephens, in collaboration with Lush and the organisation IAMWHOLE to 'help people form healthier relationships with their devices'.
