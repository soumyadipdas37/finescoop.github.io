Earlier this month, it was rumored that Cara has started dating singer Halsey, after their exes Ashley Benson and G-Eazy got together.

Cara and Pretty Little Liars alum Ashley broke up in April after two years together. 

Over the summer, Cara was linked with Cindy Crawford's model daughter Kaia Gerber, 19, after the latter's split from SNL star Pete Davidson.

Kaia and Cara even got matching 'solemate' tattoos before the teen beauty moved on to actor Jacob Elordi.
