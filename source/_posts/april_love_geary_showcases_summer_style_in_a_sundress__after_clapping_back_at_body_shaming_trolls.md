She's one busy mom.

April Love Geary, 25, looked summer chic as she stepped out to run errands near her home in Malibu on Saturday.

The wife of crooner Robin Thicke recently clapped back at haters online who have been criticizing the model for gaining weight since having her two daughters.

The blonde beauty kept things simple while grabbing supplies at the Vintage Grocers market.

She rocked a muted coral short sleeve sundress that was made of a textured material with a plunging V-neck.

The loose fitting frock flowed away from her 5' 11" frame and hit just below her tanned knees.

April left her long hair down in beach waves and donned a printed protective face mask with leopard print sandals.

The mother of two carried a brown paper bag full of provisions from the market and accessorized with sunglasses and a YSL purse.

Geary has been busy during quarantine keeping up with daughters Mia, two, and Lola, one. 

And, the IMG model fired back at baseless body shamers this month who have been openly trolling the weight she has gained since giving birth.

'Just letting you know that I'm not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was 'so much more attractive' when I was skinnier,' began Geary, who posted the video to her Instagram Story.

'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' she said. 

Although she did not provide specific examples of the body shaming she has been receiving online, Geary made clear with her tone that the frequency of such comments is high.

April became a mom first time in 2018, four-years after she began dating Thicke.

Robin proposed to April in December of 2018, while she was pregnant with their second child, daughter Lola.
