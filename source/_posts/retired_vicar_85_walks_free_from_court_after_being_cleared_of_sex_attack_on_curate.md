Rev Geraint Hughes, 85, was found not guilty of sexual assault by a jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court

A retired vicar has been cleared of sexually assaulting a woman curate after being accused of leaping at her ‘like a rabbit out of a rabbit hole’.

Rev Geraint Hughes, 85, pictured, allegedly told her ‘I really miss having cuddles’ after being recently widowed.

The woman claimed she tried to fend off the clergyman by saying ‘Let us pray’ when he kissed her three times.

She was visiting his home last year to discuss Sunday services when he wrapped his arms around her, it was alleged.

Hughes, the former Dean of Brecon Cathedral in South Wales, admitted hugging the married curate and kissing her once. 

But he said it was all a misunderstanding and he ‘didn’t cross the line’.

A jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court took less than 30 minutes to find him not guilty of sexual assault.
