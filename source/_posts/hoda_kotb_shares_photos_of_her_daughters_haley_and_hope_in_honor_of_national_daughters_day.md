Hoda Kotb paid tribute to her daughters Haley Joy and Hope Catherine in honor of National Daughter's Day, sharing sweet photos of the sisters playing together. 

The 56-year-old Today co-anchor took to Instagram on Friday to post adorable snapshots of her little girls, revealing just how big three-year-old Haley and one-year-old Hope are getting.  

'Daughters rock! Happy national daughters day,' she captioned the images, which show her only children hanging on a metal pole sticking out of the grass.

Sisters: In the photos, Hope and Haley are wearing denim jackets and playing outside together 

In the first snapshot, Haley is squatting down in front of her little sister Hope, who is looking down at the ground. Hoda has yet to post a photo revealing her youngest daughter's entire face.

The girls are dressed in jean jackets and sweats, with little Hope wearing a knit hat on her head. In addition to the snapshot of both her daughters, the proud mom posted solo shots of each of her girls. 

Hoda was 52 years old when she and her fiancé, financier Joel Schiffman, adopted Haley in February 2017. Two years later, they welcomed Hope in April 2019.
