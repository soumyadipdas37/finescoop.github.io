PR queen Roxy Jacenko showed herself undergoing a complete hair transformation on Tuesday. 

And it appears the 40-year-old is over the moon with her new blunted bob. 

On Wednesday, the entrepreneurial powerhouse Roxy looked high-glam as she posed in the mirror, with one side of her bob tucked behind her ear.

'Oh hey,' Roxy wrote alongside her fresh new look. 

In the image, Roxy let her blonde tresses fall to the front of her face. 

The stunning blonde kept things simple on the day, wearing a plain white Under Armour T-shirt. 

The Sweaty Betty PR founder wore a glossy makeup look which she paired with dark eye makeup and a matte lipstick.

Roxy's SAS Australia co-star Ali Oetjen commented on the photograph: 'HAAAWTT! Wow!!'     

On Tuesday, Roxy uploaded a video of herself undergoing the major transformation while sitting in the chair of celebrity hairdresser and hair stylist, Travis Balcke.

'It was time,' she captioned her Instagram post.

It is not the first time the blonde beauty has looked dramatically different.

The mother-of-two sported a noticeably smoother visage and a plumper-looking pout earlier this month in a promotional photo for her online marketing classes. 

Roxy will next be seen on SAS Australia. She and convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby reportedly 'walked' from the new series. 

According to The Daily Telegraph in August, the two stars are understood to have left just days into filming.

The report goes on to say that Roxy departed the series due to a 'lack of comforts' while Schapelle struggled with the 'fitness' aspect of the gruelling new reality series.
