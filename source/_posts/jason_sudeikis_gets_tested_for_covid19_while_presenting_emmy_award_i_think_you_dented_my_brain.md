Ted Lasso co-creator and star Jason Sudeikis poked fun of the strict protocols put in place by the TV Academy to prevent the spread of the coronavirus during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony on Sunday night.

The 45-year-old SNL alum was in the middle of presenting the trophy for outstanding comedy series when a nurse wearing scrubs, gloves, mask, and face shield stepped onscreen to test him.

'Really? Can't wait five minutes? Okay, sorry folks, we're just legally obligated to get COVID tests every hour. TV Academy policy,' Jason (born Daniel) said during the virtual ABC telecast.

Safety first! Ted Lasso co-creator and star Jason Sudeikis poked fun of the strict protocols put in place by the TV Academy to prevent the spread of the coronavirus during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony on Sunday night

'Don't worry, you won't even notice she's here. So anyway, some truly revolutionary shows like I Love Lucy and All In the Family and Everybody Loves Raymond...oooh wow, that's deep! Okay. Owww.'

After probing Sudeikis' nostril with a swab, the nurse asked him what his birth date was and he jokingly replied: 'I don't know anymore. I think you dented my brain.'

Unsurprisingly, the Emmy went to the father-son creators of Schitt's Creek - Eugene & Dan Levy - since the show won 17 other trophies that night. 

Meanwhile, the Virginia-born, Kansas-raised actor's fiancée of seven years - Olivia Wilde - shared a vintage snap of I Love Lucy's Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball and congratulated all the nominees and winners.

Nearly a clean sweep! Unsurprisingly, the Emmy went to the father-son creators of Schitt's Creek - Eugene & Dan Levy - since the show won 17 other trophies that night

Jason and the 36-year-old Emmy-winning producer will celebrate the third birthday of their daughter Daisy on October 11 and they're also parents of six-year-old son Otis.

Four years ago, Sudeikis joked on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live that he and Wilde 'won't get married until weed is legal in every state.' 

The Mandalorian guest star ended his first marriage to writer-producer Kay Cannon in 2010, and Olivia ended her first marriage to Italian filmmaker Tao Ruspoli in 2011. 

'Happy Emmys Day!' Meanwhile, the Virginia-born, Kansas-raised actor's fiancée of seven years - Olivia Wilde - shared a vintage snap of I Love Lucy's Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball and congratulated all the nominees and winners

Two-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey confirmed Friday that he'll take over Jason's impersonation of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for the 46th season of Saturday Night Live, which premieres October 3 on NBC.
