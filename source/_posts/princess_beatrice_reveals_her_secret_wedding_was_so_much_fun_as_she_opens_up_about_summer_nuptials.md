Princess Beatrice has said her secret wedding was 'so much fun' in her first comments about her surprise summer nuptials.  

The Queen's granddaughter, 32, was due to marry Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 36, at St James's Palace on 29 May but plans were postponed due to Covid-19 - and they instead tied the knot in a surprise secret ceremony at Windsor Castle on 17 July with just twenty guests. 

The royal has now spoken out about the wedding for the first time as she appeared in a video for the Forget Me Not Children’s Hospice and announced the winners of the organisation's Kids Summer Art Competition 2020.

In a video released on their Twitter page, Princess Beatrice said: 'I had the chance to get married this summer and it was so much fun.'

Appearing in the clip, Princess Beatrice opted for a midi floral gown for the occasion and wore her long auburn locks in soft curls. 

Beatrice has been working with the charity for the past eight years and is its official royal patron. 

The royal has visited the hospice on several occasions and spent time with both the young children and their families who receive the much needed support and care.  

The video appears to have been filmed at the same time as the royal's wedding dress was unveiled at Windsor Castle last week.

The Sir Norman Hartnell gown, first worn by the Queen in the 1960s, was loaned to Beatrice by her grandmother for her low-key wedding to Edo. 

Her wedding gown will be on display from September 24 until November 22, the Royal Collection Trust announced earlier this month. 

Princess Beatrice and Edo enjoyed a slimmed-down wedding at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor on July 17. 

The ceremony details were not made public beforehand and the pair were originally due to marry in the Chapel Royal followed by a reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace – but their wedding was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Appearing in the charity video, the royal beamed as she described her own secret summer wedding as 'such fun' 

The clip appears to have been filmed on the same day that Princess Beatrice attended the unveiling of her bridal gown at Windsor Castle last week 

Beatrice's father the Duke of York walked her down the aisle but he did not feature in the photographs released by Buckingham Palace. The wedding was also attended by The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. 

Princess Beatrice's latest comments come as the York family celebrate the news that Beatrice's younger sister Princess Eugenie is expecting her first baby.

The royal, who married husband Jack Brooksbank in October 2018, are expecting the baby in early 2021. 

Sharing the news on Instagram last week, Eugenie, 30, wrote: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021....,' alongside photos of baby slippers and her and Jack smiling.

Her mother Sarah Ferguson shared her excitement, writing: 'I am so excited by the news that Eugenie and Jack are expecting their first child.

'Thrilled for them both and in my 60th year cannot wait to be a grandmother. Welcoming a new baby into the York family is going to be a moment of profound joy.'

On her Storytime with Fergie and Friends channel, she read out – appropriately enough – a tale of magic called Nanna Maureen, by Casey Gillespie.

The baby will be the first grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, and will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's ninth great-grandchild.

Princess Beatrice's comments come days after her younger sister Princess Eugenie announced she is expecting her first baby with husband Jack Brooksbank
