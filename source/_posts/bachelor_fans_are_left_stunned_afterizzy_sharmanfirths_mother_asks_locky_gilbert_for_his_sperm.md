Bachelor viewers were left stunned after Izzy Sharman-Firth's mother asked Locky Gilbert for his sperm during Wednesday's episode.

The 29-year-old Bachelor hopeful had taken Locky home to meet her two mums, when one of the women decided to ask the handsome reality star for his sperm.

'We just wondered... This is probably a little, tiny bit out there, but, you know, I've always said to Isabella, if she doesn't really find a man and she feels like a baby, is there any chance, as a consolation prize, just a little bit of sperm...' she asked.

Fans had plenty to say about the outrageous interaction, which left Locky, 31, momentarily dumbfounded.

'If Izzy wants to know where it all went horribly wrong, perhaps go back to the moment where mum brokered Locky's sperm as a potential consolation prize,' tweeted one viewer.

'Izzy, will you accept this sperm?' wrote one person, while another shocked viewer asked, 'Did Izzy's Mum just ask for Locky's sperm...'

Others thought the woman's aggressive approach to asking for what she wanted was both terrifying and admirable.  

'Locky's Sleep Paralysis demon is Izzy's Mum coming at him with a sperm extractor,' tweeted one person.

'So... Izzy's mums are planning to take Lachy's sperm in some sort of sacrificial ritual? Right? RIGHT?' asked one viewer.

'These two women didn't come to play... they are in a sperm hunt,' added another fan, while one tweeted, '"Can we get a little sperm..." Izzy's mum has the Esky out in the car.'   

Wrote one fan: 'Izzy's mum is running a commune AND a sperm harvesting program. My new idol.'  

Izzy's mum assured Locky that all he'd have to do is provide the sperm, and said she was asking because she thought he'd 'make nice, tall babies'.

And after being grilled about his opinions on feminism, Locky said he thought the sperm question was an indication that his meeting with Izzy's mums had turned around.

'At first, I thought the mums were not happy, but now they're talking about freezing my sperm? So I guess the talk's going pretty well,' he said. 

He added: 'We would have good-looking kids.' 

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
