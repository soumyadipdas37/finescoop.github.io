When Queensland closed its borders in August, many Australians praised the state for taking action to protect its citizens from COVID-19.

But as the summer months fast approach, those locked out of the Sunshine State are feeling frustrated and envious of the lucky locals enjoying their gated paradise.

Making matters worse is the army of Queensland-based Instagram models and reality stars who insist upon rubbing their easy-going lives in the faces of their thousands of followers. 

Wish you were here? Bikini-clad Instagram models and reality rejects are flaunting their idyllic and easy-going lives in Queensland as the borders remain shut. Pictured: Ali Oetjen visiting the beach on Sunday  

Kicking off the list of Insta-braggers is former Bachelorette Ali Oetjen, who spent Monday afternoon posing for envy-inducing photos in Noosa.

'Since being up here in Noosa I've been getting my car professionally cleaned,' chirped Ali as she posed in the sunshine next to her maroon vehicle. 

Beaming in a floaty white shirt and linen shorts, the blonde looked far more serene than how the millions stuck in Melbourne's stage-four lockdown must be feeling.

Elsewhere, Bachelor reject Steph Harper put her backside on display on Monday as she posed for a racy Instagram photo on her Gold Coast balcony.  

'Not a bad place to be,' mused the blonde, referring to her idyllic locale.

However, the focal point of the image was not the balcony's view, but rather Steph's physique, which was barely covered by a skimpy black G-string and matching bra.

'Blue skies, white highs, won’t blind everything you hide,' wrote the blonde as she preened for the camera in a floral frock. 

Instagram sensation Tammy Hembrow has also been enjoying a similarly charmed existence inside her Gold Coast mansion.

While Melbourne residents have struggled to cope with curfews and on-the-spot fines, Tammy has been sharing Instagram posts of herself in bikinis at the beach, attending parties and holidaying in the Whitsundays with her boyfriend Matt Poole. 

On Sunday, Married At First Sight's Jessika Power also sparked envy among her fans by sharing a photo of herself attending an exclusive bash in Surfers Paradise. 

Far from appearing concerned about the state of the world's crippling health emergency, Jessika beamed as she posed with fellow MAFS star Ines Basic and ex-Bachelor stars Stephanie Harper, Charley Bond and Gemma White.

Skye Wheatley - who was slammed for staging a glamorous photo shoot in front of cleared-out toilet paper aisles in Coles at the height of panic buying in March - has also been documenting her fancy-free existence in Queensland amid the pandemic.

On Monday, the former Big Brother star uploaded a racy image to Instagram of herself lounging seductively by the ocean, alongside the caption: 'Feels like summer'.

Steve Irwin's 'hot niece' Rebecca Lobie uploaded a similar bikini photo earlier this month as she enjoyed a leisurely weekend trip to the beach.

Insta-bragging isn't reserved for the ladies, however, as Queensland social media star Reece Hawkins also recently shared a sun-soaked photo of himself relaxing in the backyard. 

Earlier this month, Bachelor in Paradise's Jake Ellis uploaded a photo of himself visiting a Gold Coast café - something many Australians have been unable to do because of the pandemic.
