Kylie Jenner is undeniably smitten with her two-year-old daughter Stormi Webster.

And the 23-year-old makeup mogul captured the tot's infectious smile in a series of snapshots shared to her Instagram on Friday. 

'this smile,' captioned Jenner, who boasts 194million followers on the platform.

She wore a bright orange tee that had an upside down Reese's Puffs logo printed on it and a pair of comfy grey shorts.

To finish off her casual ensemble, Kylie slipped Stormi's feet into a pair of white socks and some fun multi-colored sneakers.

Kylie shares Stormi with 29-year-old rapper Travis Scott, whom she split from in October of 2019.

Despite ceasing their romantic relations, Kylie and Travis have remained civil and committed to co-parenting their little girl.

Shortly after showing off Stormi to the world, Jenner uploaded a sassy self-portrait to her Instagram page.

'weekend vibes,' wrote the Kylie Cosmetics founder, followed by two flower emojis.

Kylie rocked a monochromatic look, which she previewed earlier in the day, as she posed in front of the large gray door that acts as the entrance to her lavish mansion. 

She had on a fun headscarf with flowers that had smiling faces that covered her long hair which was lighter at the bottom.

Kylie added a white crop top that showed off her lean tummy, adding khaki sweatpants that seemed one size too big.

$eling: 'My three lip kits are officially live and I also have a sale going on right now on Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin, one of my annual sales,' said the 23-year-old business woman

Jenner's chunky beige sneakers had a thick sole and she had a small purse on her shoulder as she held on to a jacket. And there was plenty of bling with several yellow gold bracelets. 

The daughter of Kris Jenner added a cross necklace with diamonds.

Her makeup was nude tones that looked soft and clean. 

Kylie also was seen in her car; she has explained that often she has to leave her neighborhood so she can post because her home does not have good wifi.

Earlier this week the youngest Jenner showed her fans what's on her breakfast menu.

In new images shared to her Instagram Stories the mogul offered a close-up look at the dishes that looked quite delicious.

In one post was eggs, bacon and avocado toast, in another was pancakes with a berry sauce and a third saw a blueberry muffin dusted with powdered sugar. The total calories count for all three dishes is over 1,300.

It is not known if she ate all three plates but she likely had some of it in the series of posts that went up on Wednesday morning.

Three scrambles eggs is about 234 calories. Two slices of bacon is around 90 calories.

When avocado toast is made with whole grain bread and one third of an avocado is used, it's 260 calories.

Two small pancakes with jelly on top and syrup with butter is in the ballpark of 300 calories.

Indulge: And the blueberry muffin looks healthy and small, but it is likely about 450 calories

The total calorie combination is 1,334. The daily recommended calories in the US is 2,000, which would include all three meals.

Interestingly, the daily recommended calories in France is 1,500. 

The siren also showed off her dinner, which seemed to be chicken with onions and lemon with a carrot with a side of tube pasta and a red sauce as well as a plate of Bruschetta with mozzarella, tomatoes and basil dressed in balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

On Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie has been seen in the kitchen as she says, like her mom Kris Jenner, she loves making meals.

During Thanksgiving she offered her recipe for sweet potatoes that included maple syrup.

The mother to Stormi Webster does not seem to try too hard to cut calories, but she still has an enviable hourglass figure that she uses to promote her Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin companies.

Her shape could just be due to good genes or consistent workouts.

Her eating habits are in direct contrast with those of her sister Kim Kardashian who has been on the Atkins Diet, which limits carbs.

Kim, who will be 40 in October, has talked often about how hard it is to stay slender because she loves junk food like Kentucky Fried Chicken and In-N-Out as well as churros.

And sister Khloe, who was called the 'fat sister' has written an entire book on how to stay slim by cutting down on carbs.
