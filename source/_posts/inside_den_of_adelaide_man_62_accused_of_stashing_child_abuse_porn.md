The squalid den of a 62-year-old man who allegedly stashed child porn in his home has been uncovered following a police raid on the property. 

The Adelaide man has also been accused of sending $65,000 to producers of child abuse material in the Philippines following an Australian Federal Police raid on his home on July 16.

Police said they seized a laptop, USB, several DVDs and CDs, a dozen Western Union money transfer forms and multiple external hard drives for further examination.

The AFP allege the man was a customer of the child abuse facilitators in the Philippines and has been sending them money since 2006.

Investigators allegedly found child abuse material and 'extensive communication' with suspected residents in the Philippines when they did a preliminary examination of the data storage devices.

Police said analysis of seized items is ongoing and further charges may be laid. 

The man has been arrested and charged with possessing child abuse material and using a carriage service to access child pornography material.

The maximum penalty for these offences is 15 years’ imprisonment.  

He was due to face Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Monday.

The warrant was carried out on the man's home after information supplied by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, police allege.

'No child anywhere in the world should have to be victimised for the perverted desires of some people in our community,' AFP Detective Acting Superintendent Gavin Stone said.

'The AFP and South Australia Police are working around-the-clock with our partners to bring to justice those who seek to do harm to our children.'
