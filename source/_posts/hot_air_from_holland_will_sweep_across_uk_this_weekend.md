Britain will bask in a spell of sunshine and warm weather this weekend as a plume of hot air drifts across the UK. 

While we may not be able to sit outdoors with six friends, Brits can at least enjoy the balmy weather for a few days before the temperature drops. 

Warm air from mainland Europe has triggered some unlikely September sun with temperatures expected to climb to around 22C in London at the weekend. 

The seasonal average daytime temperature for England and Wales in September is 18C (64F).

Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna explained that the unseasonable highs had been triggered by warm spells from countries in mainland Europe such as France and Spain.

But the Met office has warned sun-seekers to not get too used to the heat as temperatures are expected to drop by next week. 

Met Office forecasters say Saturday and Sunday is likely to be warm and sunny for much of the UK, before conditions turn more unsettled from Tuesday.  

The Met Office said Scotland can expect odd spots of rain before sunnier, warmer spells on Saturday while the rest of the UK will be generally sunny and warm.  

There could be showers early on Sunday morning, Met Office forecasters warn, with early mist and fog before a generally dry and sunny day.  

The picture will become more unsettled from the northwest on Tuesday.

On Monday and Tuesday Britons flocked to beaches and parks across the country to enjoy the hot spell which brought with it temperatures of up to 30C (86F). 

The sunny weather came as the government's new 'rule of six' on social gatherings was put into motion this week.

While many Britons appeared to be following the guidelines, others were pictured clearly flouting the new rules - an offence that can lead to a £100 fine.
