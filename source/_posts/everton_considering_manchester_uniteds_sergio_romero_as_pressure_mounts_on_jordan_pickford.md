Everton are monitoring Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero as potential competition for the error-prone Jordan Pickford, according to reports. 

The United shot stopper has fallen down the pecking order following Dean Henderson's move to the number two goalkeeper behind regular first-choice David de Gea.

The Toffees, meanwhile, are looking for alternative options in goal and Pickford made two glaring errors in the 5-2 Carabao Cup win over Fleetwood Town in midweek.

And according to The Mirror, Romero is interested in a move to Goodison Park with Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti keeping tabs on the situation, though no formal offer has been made. 

Pickford was once again slammed by Everton supporters despite helping his side reach the fourth round of the League Cup against Joey Barton's Fleetwood.

With the Premier League side holding a comfortable 2-0 lead at the break, the England international goalkeeper's poor pass out from the back allowed Mark Duffy to reduce the deficit to one.

While Everton reestablished their two-goal lead shortly after, Pickford was at fault again for Fleetwood's second goal of the game, as Callum Camps' overhead kick went straight through his hands and into the corner of the net.  

The 26-year-old was also criticised by pundits for diving too late for Grady Diangana's opener in Everton's 5-2 win over West Brom at the weekend, a goal which saw the Toffees fall behind early on. 

And Romero's arrival could mean trouble for Pickford as the Argentine has proven to be a reliable option between the stick at Manchester United.  

Romero is now Man United's third-choice goalkeeper though has 39 shutouts in 67 matches

Romero has been at Old Trafford for just over five years, though has only made seven Premier League appearances for the Red Devils, with his last top-flight appearance coming on the final day of the 2017/18 season in a home tie against Watford. 

He did play a key role in United winning the 2017 Europa League title, playing 12 times as Jose Mourinho's side lifted the trophy against Ajax in the final.

The goalkeeper's current Manchester United deal ends in the summer of 2021 and the club could cash in on their third-choice option or risk losing him on a free transfer. 

Romero's overall record for Manchester United in all competitions stands at 67 matches, in which he has kept 39 clean sheets and conceded just 27 goals.
