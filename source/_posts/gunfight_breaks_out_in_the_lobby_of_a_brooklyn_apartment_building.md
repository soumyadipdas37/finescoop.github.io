'I don’t know who would do this,' said William Mendez, a longtime friend of Scully's. 'I don’t believe he had any enemies. Everybody loved Mike.'

'He loved Brooklyn,' Mendez, 55, added. 'You needed help, he was there for you. He was just the best.'

According to friends of Scully, he was warm-hearted and kind man who spent several years working for a technology company. He liked to bring his dogs with him to church.  

He was also an entrepreneur who bought and sold items, like perfumes and clothes, on the side. Scully kept a list of all the perfumes he had in stock, friends said.

Scully lived downstairs from his brother in a two-family home they shared. The brother was overcome with emotion as he hugged their sister outside their home just hours after the shooting, NYDN reports.

David Martinez, a longtime friend of Scully, said the man's girlfriend died about two years ago and the loss was devastating.

Her funeral was one of the only times the Martinez saw Scully cry. The other two occasions were during the funerals of his father and mother.

'He didn’t deserve this,' said Martinez. 'This is execution-style.'  

Around 3am on Monday, in the same borough were Scully was killed, a six-year-old boy was scooped up off the pavement by his mother after they were both shot during a pre-dawn J'Ouvert celebration.

In the video, obtained by DailyMail.com, some of the 300 people who gathered for a pre-dawn procession celebrating the Caribbean J'Ouvert festival are heard screaming in terror and fleeing after the gun went off. 

The boy is seen lying on the pavement in a pool of his own blood as a woman, identified as his mother, rushes over and tries to pick him up. 

A few feet away from the boy, a man is seen collapsed on the ground after he was also apparently struck by gunfire. 

Police sources told the New York Post that the boy, identified as Maxwell Cesc-Vinho, was shot in the left leg while his mother Patricia Bratwaith, 47, and a man named Flavian Yves, 40, were struck in the left foot. 

The sources identified the other two victims as Bob Charlotin, 46, and Kelly Barthold, 34, and said they were both shot in the right leg.

NYPD officers arrested two men at the scene who were both carrying guns, but police have not confirmed whether either was the shooter.   

Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the shooting, but NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said it appeared to be gang-related.

'It was really crazy - everyone was in shock,' Joshua Kristal, who was in the procession when the shooting occurred, told the Post.  

'The boy, his mom was carrying him. You could see there was blood in his pants. She dropped him, I didn't know what to do, then I saw tons of blood.'
