She's currently in the midst of planning her wedding with fiancé Bradley Dack, after months of putting it on the back burner amid the first COVID-19 lockdown.

And Olivia Attwood, 29, looked as loved up as ever on Tuesday, when she was spotted stepping out for a romantic meal with her 26-year-old partner in Manchester.

The former Love Island star arrived Asha's Indian restaurant arm-in-arm with her beau after a day of shooting scenes for her new show, Olivia Meets Her Match.

Olivia looked casually cool for the outing, donning a black crop top and leggings with a baggy plaid blue shirt.

Donning a pair of Dior high-top sneakers, the blonde beauty rounded out her ensemble with a cobalt blue Chanel leather handbag.

Wearing her golden locks in long shoulder-length waves with a centre-parting, the TOWIE star glammed up her look with a dewy palette of makeup.

For his part, footballer Bradley teamed black skinny jeans with a patterned top and a jacket as he enjoyed his day out with his wife-to-be.

Last week, Olivia appeared to be in full wedding planning mode, as she was seen trying on a selection of gowns at Blackburn Bridal Couture. 

Joined by her mother Jenny for the day, the media personality seemed to be in her element as she slipped in and out of gowns.

Olivia looked sensational in a slinky column gown with sheer panels and lace adornment.

The bride-to-be was a vision in the dress, which featured a low cut neckline and sheer full length skirt with a mini train. 

Sharing a quick video inside the boutique, Olivia mused: 'I've started looking for my dress today. My crew are in tow... because why not? Let's get married baby!'

During the exciting outing Olivia was seen eyeing up a number of possible gowns and searching through racks to find the right one. 

Fans will be able to see more gowns when her new reality TV show airs on ITVBe this autumn.

The eight-episode series will follow Olivia and her Blackburn Rovers footballer fiancé Bradley as they plan their wedding and buy their first home in Cheshire.

The couple got engaged in Dubai last year and the programme will document their relationship as they prepare to take it the next level, with Olivia planning her dream wedding.

Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.

However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore.

Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson.

Speaking to OK! magazine earlier this month, Olivia revealed that her wedding plans were thrown up in the air when the coronavirus pandemic hit. 

She explained: 'We had our hearts set on a destination wedding, but I’m opening up to the idea of a UK wedding because we want to get married next year and definitely can’t afford to go into quarantine for two weeks.

'I’m going to look at some UK venues and see if they can turn my head.'
