Millions of Australians are set to receive a $50 gift from the government under a new household relief package. 

The scheme will apply to Queenslanders who will receive the discount on their next electricity bills, with some in regional areas already having their power bills reduced. 

Another two million are expected to get the discount on their next electricity bill as a result of dividends from publicly-owned power assets in the state.

Tenants and electricity users who receive a bill from their landlord or body corporate will get the $50 bonus payment, as will those where card-operated electricity metres are used. 

Another $50 bonus payment will also be distributed in 2021 in the same way, according to Energy Minister Dr Anthony Lynham. 

'Queensland has the energy trifecta: lowest average prices on the eastern seaboard, reliable supply and a planned transition to a renewable future,' he said on Wednesday. 

'Unlike other states, the dividends from our publicly-owned companies flow not to multinational shareholders overseas, but to Queensland families across the state.' 

The dividends follow the Palaszczuk government's COVID household relief package, which provided Queensland households with $200 off their utility bills and $500 for small business.  

'Queensland has an economic strategy for recovery from the global coronavirus and it is important to help households pay their power bills during these tough times,' Ms Palaszczuk said.

'Because of our strong health response, we are able to get on with helping Queensland Unite and Recover in this post-COVID economy.'

The dividend payment already applied to some Ergon regional bills from last week and will be appearing progressively as people receive bills.
