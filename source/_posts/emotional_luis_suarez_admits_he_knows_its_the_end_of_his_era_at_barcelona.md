Luis Suarez broke down in tears as he proclaimed the 'end of an era' at Barcelona after expressing gratitude for the club's faith in him ahead of his exit. 

The Uruguayan striker, who will sign for Atletico Madrid in a £5.5million deal, brought down the curtain on six years at the Nou Camp by saying he will always be a fan of the club.  

Suarez joined Barca in 2014 and helped the club win four LaLiga titles, four Copa del Reys and the Champions League in 2015.

The 33-year-old said goodbye in an emotional farewell press conference at the Nou Camp on Thursday afternoon.

He said: 'It is such a surprise, I didn't have anything really prepared.

'The club has always had so much confidence in me since 2014 when they signed me. 

'The conditions that I came here, they surrounded me, the confidence they had in me, it wasn't easy to accept this, the coaches and the team-mates, the way they accepted me when I came, it was amazing. 

'All the people know the sacrifice that I made in these years to come to Barcelona and play for the best team in the world. I am aware we are at the end of an era but I should be very proud of everything we have done.'

Atletico Madrid confirmed that they have agreed a deal to sign Luis Suarez for £5.5million

During his time at Barcelona Suarez scored 198 goals in 283 appearances.

However, he was informed by recently-appointed manager Ronald Koeman that he isn't part of his plans.

Suarez has scored eight goals in 18 appearances against Atletico during his career, so Diego Simeone's side will certainly be pleased that he is now playing for them.

The Uruguayan will be determined to prove to Koeman that he made a mistake in letting him leave.

With Suarez departing, Antoine Griezmann, who endured a difficult first season at Barcelona, should receive more opportunities to play as a central striker.
