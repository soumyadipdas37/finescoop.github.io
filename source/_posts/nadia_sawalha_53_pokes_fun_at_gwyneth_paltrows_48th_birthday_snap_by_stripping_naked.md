'In nothing but my birthday suit today... thank you all so much for the birthday wishes and thank you to @goop 's insanely amazing brand new body butter for making me think I can still get my kit off. #goopgenes' she captioned the snap. 

While the snap delighted countless fans, there was one Instagram user who was not amused - and that was her teenage daughter Apple Martin, 16, who simple commented: 'MOM.'

After receiving an overwhelmingly positive response to a recent bikini video, Nadia vowed to never diet or count calories again.

She said of the video: 'The thing was, it was a very hot day when I posted that and I was saying to Mark, I know how many women are feeling today.

'"I'm not going to wear this because of my arms, I'm going to pretend I'm cooler than I am so I don't have to take my cardigan off, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that".

'I thought I'm just going to post this and there's always a bit of nerves before I post anything. But I was absolutely overwhelmed. 

'Over 2,000 comments and I've read every single one. Many of the ones I read made me cry. I've thought all those things that those women have thought. 

She continued: 'I've spent a lifetime not getting in the pool, not wearing a swimsuit. Not daring to show my arms. I'm not talking about weight, I'm talking about the stinking thinking that so many of us as women have.

'Nobody in my entire life has ever said anything as nasty to me as I've said to myself.'
