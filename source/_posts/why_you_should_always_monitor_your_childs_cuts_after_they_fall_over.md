An Australian mother has warned parents to keep an eye on any wounds their children sustain after her son contracted a serious infection from a fall at the zoo.

While the woman was in 'two minds' about sharing the photo of her little boy, she was ultimately convinced to do it as an educational tool - and because her husband wouldn't have known there was a problem without her knowledge.

'I am sure there are other parents who wouldn't know about it either and the only reason I knew is because it had happened to a friend's son two years ago and she had shared,' the lady, who chose to remain anonymous, said.

The innocent-looking photo shows a bandage on her son's hand from a recent cut, and a red line emerging from it, stretching up his wrist.

'A week or so ago the littlest fell over at the zoo. He took quite a bashing but once we got home I cleaned him up,' she said of the incident.

'I rang his school because they were having a "farm" day and I wanted to make sure he washed his hands after digging. I tried to ensure it was kept clean (both his hand and elbow). However, he's an eight-year-old boy.'

When he came home that day the wounds didn't look outwardly infected, but she was concerned that they had gotten a little bit bigger.

They weren't 'gunky' like you would usually expect from an infection.

'Yesterday on our way to the beach he showed me his hand. I wasn't happy as I noticed red tracking down his vein,' she said.

'I then checked his elbow - the same. I took him down to the out of hours GP feeling a bit silly but when the doctor saw it he commended me on recognising it and getting down ASAP.'

The red line is called Lymphangitis, or inflammation of the lymphatic channels that occurs as a result of infection.

This means the infection is in the lymphatic system, and it causes red lines from the wound that travel in the direction of the nearest lymph gland.

If treated quickly, the condition can be mild but if left untreated, complications can occur, and the condition can become very serious. 

When the infection crosses over into the bloodstream, like it did for this boy, it's known as sepsis.

The thin red line was revealed to be blood poisoning, or sepsis. It's not the type of infection you can simply 'leave' alone to heal, she said.

'Thankfully the antibiotics are working and he is well in himself. If you spot this red line running from a wound get your child seen straight away,' she continued.

'Hopefully, my post might help someone the way my friend's post from two years ago helped me.'

Tiny Heart Education shared the post on behalf of the mother, saying that the red line is called Lymphangitis.

* Rapid uneven breathing

* Convulsions

* A rash that doesn't fade when you press it

* Fever or a very low temperature

* Pale skin

* Inability to pass urine 

* Lethargy

'If treated quickly, the condition can be mild but if left untreated, complications can occur, and the condition can become very serious. When the infection crosses over into the bloodstream, like it did for this boy, it's known as sepsis.' 

Sepsis is a life-threatening complication to an infection, and can show itself by way of rapid breathing, convulsions, a rash that doesn't fade when you press it, fever or a very low temperature, pale skin, inability to pass urine and lethargy.

It must be treated with antibiotics, and sometimes, intravenous fluids. If left unchecked it can damage multiple organ systems and cause death. 

Many parents were shocked to learn of the unassuming red line in the post and said they would never have thought it was serious.

'Thank you for all your tips I would have never have known this and it's not something you learn in first aid either,' said one mother.

'This is sensational, I had no idea about this. Thank you for sharing,' said another.
