A growing number of Australian women are exercising in a full-length leotard slashed with a gaping cut out that exposes most of the midriff.

Designed by Melbourne sportswear label Contrology Active, the all-in-one 'Curve Bodysuit' is described as 'the perfect fit for every body' - resulting in a surprisingly flattering effect on various shapes and sizes.

The asymmetrical one-piece - which costs $219 on the brand's official website - is available in extra small through large, with double-lining across the bust for added support. 

The streamlined style which clings to the body is said to be more efficient for vigorous exercise like high-intensity interval training, because there's no loose material to get in the way of your work out.

Made from polyester and elastane, it's perfect for Pilates, yoga and all manner of gym classes for those daring enough to wear it. 

Initially released in 2018, sales of the bodysuit have surged since March when lockdown sparked unprecedented demand for comfortable activewear.

Photos have drawn delighted responses on Instagram, with fashionistas leaving comments like 'love this outfit so much, I need it', 'yes!' and 'this one-piece is life' accompanied by lines of adoring emojis.

The piece has even drawn celebrity fans, with MasterChef Australia judge Melissa Leong rocking it in an Instagram post back in February.

And it's not the only all-in-one leotard capturing imaginations on social media.

Dozens of Australian activewear brands are creating full-body workout suits which promise to mould perfectly to women's natural curves, providing support in all the right places. 

Among the best-selling designs are Solo Staple's $180 bodysuits, which are available in neutrals like black as well as pastel shades of pink and purple.

Solo Staple founder Alicia Superina came up with the idea when she found the leggings, sports bras and baggy tank tops she usually wore running were interrupting her flow.

'I was constantly tucking in or readjusting,' she wrote on her website.

After two years of research Ms Superina launched her brand on Valentine's Day 2020, with a collection of highly practical bodysuits that have been flying out of stock ever since.

It's a similar success story for Paris and Samantha, the duo behind activewear brand Paris and I, who released a range of luxury bodysuits with biker short length in June 2019.

The $129.99 moisture-wicking suits are super stretchy with a 'scrunch' design around the bottom that accentuates the glutes.

In a recent post on Instagram, the ladies drew attention to a number of 'copy cat' brands making cheaper copies of their ensembles, minus the good quality fabric.

Pip Edwards' Bondi label P.E Nation created the $220 Drive Force Catsuit complete with a v-neck in honour of the trend, and has sold out in size extra large.

'In a form fitting shape, this performance catsuit features a hidden shelf bra for extra support with adjustable shoulder straps and a criss-cross back,' the website read.

'The one-piece features ribbed panelling for further support throughout the legs, with sand colour piping detail and a P.E Nation flat rubber print on the side leg.'  

Running Bare has also jumped on the trend with the $139.99 Lotus Medusa Catsuit which has 'no uncomfortable hemlines, tops that ride up' or mismatched separates.
