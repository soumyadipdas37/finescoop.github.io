A 72-year-old woman who lost a finger while trying to save her dog as it was attacked by an off-leash pit bull has opened up about the worst 30 seconds of her life.

'I just remember screaming at the top of my voice, just terrible screaming,' the 72-year-old told Nine News.

CCTV footage shows Ms Hills trying to free Ollie as her wrist got caught in the dog's mouth.

The pit bull's owner ran over and to stop the attack, but a third dog briefly joined fight before it was broken up. 

Ms Hills was treated for at the scene for serious injuries to her hands before she was rushed to Sydney Hand Hospital.

'I thought I was going to lose my whole wrist, I didn't think I was going to get it out of his mouth no matter how much they punched him or kicked him and threw water on him - he never flinched,' Ms Hills said.

Ms Hills has lost part of one finger while metal splints are holding the others together, and she faces months of rehabilitation to gain back the use of her hand.
