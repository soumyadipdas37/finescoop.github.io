Previously working as a tradesman, Luke's older brother Jack, 26, put his work as a builder on hold 18 months ago to launch his own streetwear label, Hemm. 

'Eventually I decided to have a crack at it [the fashion label], and it's been going well. It's mainly for a female audience, but we have the intention of going into the male space as well,' Jack told Daily Mail Australia.

He co-founded the project in 2019 with his partner Celeste Rochele - who he also works with on social media content via her production company, Lens Loop.

With more than 300k followers on Instagram, Jack says part of his growing success as a social media star on the platform has been due to his association with famous brother, Luke. 

As a perk of his large audience, Jack has been fortunate enough to land sponsored posts and collaborations with well-known brands.   

Jack documents his every-day-life on the app, which includes his laidback beachside lifestyle, foodie outings and his passion for CrossFit.

While he jokes his 'commitment level isn't there yet' to enter a CrossFit competition, he said his mates are close to convincing him to sign up for one soon. 

Living an active lifestyle, including surfing, skateboarding and CrossFit, Jack recently installed an infrared sauna from Luxo Living at his Sydney home to help decrease muscle soreness and increase recovery from his strength-training sessions.

'It's been awesome! The sauna is super quick and easy to set up and use, and has saved me heaps of money that I would have spent going to another facility that has one,' he said.

'Whenever I see him it's like brothers hanging out': While Luke has been in the limelight for almost a decade, thanks to 5SOS, Jack said he's remained grounded. Pictured: Brothers Ben, Luke and Jack Hemmings

Jack introduced his famous brother Luke to the guitar when he was in school, and his younger brother's obsession with the instrument quickly led him to global acclaim.

While Luke has been in the limelight for almost a decade, thanks to 5SOS, Jack said he often doesn't register how successful his sibling is.

'Whenever I see him it's like brothers hanging out, but it really hits home when I see some big statistic or see one of his live shows, then it's like "woah". But when I call, text or see him, it's just normal.'
