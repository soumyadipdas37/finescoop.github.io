She's been wowing fans with her style choices for decades now. 

And on Monday it was no different as Caprice stepped out in a sexy denim get-up on her way to Heart FM in London to record a radio advert about women in business. 

The model, 48, opted for a pair of tiny denim shorts that clung to her curves and meant she flashed more than a bit of leg.

Off to work: Caprice flashed more than a bit of leg as she headed over to Heart FM on Monday wearing denim hotpants and fringed knee high boots 

She matched her shorts with a boho-style pale denim jacket that had floral ornamentations and knitted floral-patterned sleeves.

Her jacket was latched together with just one button, which meant the former Dancing On Ice star flashed her midriff as she was seen running across the road.  

For footwear, Caprice wore knee-length tassled cowboy boots, while she carried her essentials in a blue leather handbag.     

Caprice's latest appearance on the streets of London comes as she is set to take on a singing role in the film, The Gift, for the first time since her lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical.

A source said: ‘Caprice has landed a leading role in an upcoming Christmas film called The Gift.

'She is really excited but also slightly nervous because she has a singing part. It is the first time she has sang in about 15 years, since her theatre days when she starred as the lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical.

'She actually has a good singing voice! She saw the final script today at a meeting with the director. 

Acting is something she wants to focus more on in the future and Caprice always tells pals that it is a great creative outlet for her.'

Caprice spent lockdown at her London home with her millionaire husband, Ty Comfort, and six-year-old sons, Jett and Jax.

In June, she was shocked to learn that she tested negative for coronavirus antibodies, despite her family contracting the virus.

Caprice recently enjoyed a family getaway to Ibiza where she was seen showcasing her stunning figure in a collection of bikinis.
