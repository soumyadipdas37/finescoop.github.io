Frank Lampard has confirmed that new signings Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell will be in his Chelsea squad for the Carabao Cup clash with Barnsley, as the Blues look to get their fitness up after a short pre-season.

Chelsea host the Championship club at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night following their defeat to Liverpool on Sunday afternoon, with a Sadio Mane double downing Lampard's side.

The Blues have had a quick turnaround from the 2019-20 campaign, and Lampard is looking to integrate a number of new signings in to his squad after a busy summer in the transfer market.

Frank Lampard has confirmed that Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell are in his squad for Barnsley

The pair are yet to make their first appearances for Chelsea since joining this summer

Timo Werner and Kai Havertz have already made their Chelsea debuts, but the likes of Hakim Ziyech, Silva and Chilwell have been sidelined with either knocks or a lack of match fitness.

And Lampard has confirmed that Silva, a free signing from Paris Saint-Germain who turned 36 on Tuesday, and Chilwell, a £50m signing from Leicester City, will be in the mix for an appearance against the Tykes on Wednesday. 

‘I am not sure if that's a birthday present or not... but he is fit,' the head coach said. 'Thiago Silva is in the squad for tomorrow. He’s getting fit so I’ll make a decision on how many minutes he may get during the game depending on what’s best for him. 

Lampard also said that Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic are closing in on a return

It comes after he confirmed that Edouard Mendy was undergoing a medical with the club

‘Ben Chilwell is also in the squad, while Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech are getting closer as well.'

Attacker Pulisic has been out of action this season and Lampard is hoping the American can get up to speed soon and offer another great option for his star-studded attack.

Lampard also confirmed that goalkeeper Edouard Mendy is undergoing a medical ahead of a £22m move from Rennes, and that Willy Caballero will be between the sticks for the Carabao Cup tie. 

‘The decision on Willy Caballero was made before Liverpool and it was a decision I made a lot in cup competitions last year. Willy trains brilliantly throughout the year and deserves these opportunities,’ Lampard added.
