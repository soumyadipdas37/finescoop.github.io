Billie Piper may have earned a ladette reputation during her younger days, and looks like she's up for a scrap in this picture from her new TV drama, I Hate Suzie, but she reckons the only way to get ahead in showbiz is to be boring. 

Billie, 37, who stars as an actress whose career is thrown into turmoil after compromising pictures of her are leaked online, says: 'It's nonsense that you can write a beautiful piece of work and be completely hammered.'
