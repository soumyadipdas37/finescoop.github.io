He's the eldest son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver.

And Patrick Schwarzenegger proved the apple didn't fall far from the tree as he showed off his hunky torso while spending time at Laguna Beach in California with friends on Saturday.

The actor, 26, put his toned abs on display as he strolled along the beach in grey swimming trunks after a dip in the ocean.

Patrick's chocolate brown locks were slicked back over his head after the quick swim, while he sported a close-cropped beard for a ruggedly handsome look.

He appeared to be in good spirits during the outing at the beach as he wore a relaxed expression while soaking up the sun. 

The model seems to often spend his time at the beach, as he took to Instagram on Sunday to share a glimpse of a huge shark that had come close to shore.

Sharing a video of the sea creature, he wrote: 'Another big boy tagged. Prog 40 yards from the shore (sic).'

Earlier this month, a proper 'cheers' was in order when Schwarzenegger held up a margarita alongside his longtime girlfriend Abby Champion, 23.  

'Not sure which I love more... ' he jokingly wrote across the photo he posted on his Insta-Story.

He also shared a quick video of Champion, who has appeared in the legendary Sports Illustrated magazine, modelling on a roof top with the sun glaring down.   

The couple have been dating for more than four years.

Schwarzenegger kicked off his acting career with a small role at the age of 10 in sports-comedy film The Benchwarmers in 2006.     

More recently he made his leading man debut in the 2018 romantic drama Midnight Sun alongside Bella Thorne and the 2019 psychological thriller Daniel Isn't Real 

His newest film, the sci-fi thriller Warning and comedy-drama film Moxie directed by Amy Poehler, had been slated to drop in 2020, but the coronavirus crisis has delayed both releases.   

He also stars in the action crime-drama film Echo Boomers that's slated to premiere in 2021.
