After marrying in a star-studded Paris ceremony in 2014, the KUWTK veteran welcomed son Saint, four, in 2015.

The condition occurs when all or part of the placenta remains attached to the uterine wall after childbirth.

Kim and Kanye made the decision to welcome baby number three, Chicago, two, via a surrogate.  

The star grew close to her surrogate, who appeared anonymously on Keeping Up with the Kardashians before welcoming Chicago in January of 2018.

Kim and Kanye also chose to welcome baby number four, Psalm, 16 months, via surrogate although they used a different woman. He was born in May 2019.

The star recently revealed that the couple and their surrogate had a therapist during her pregnancy with Chicago.

Kim revealed the news on on Laura Wasser's iHeart Radio original podcast All's Fair.  

She said: 'You get your surrogate attorney, you get your surrogate broker and then the broker recommended that we use a therapist that would communicate with me first and then communicate with her and kind of be our liaison.' 

During her surrogate pregnancy with Psalm, she opted to forego the therapist, 'because I kind of knew the drill.'    

As well as being a risk to her health, Kim admitted that she found pregnancy 'the worst experience of her life!'

Writing on her website, she explained: 'I'm gonna keep it real: For me, pregnancy is the worst experience of my life!'

Tweeting her decision at the time, she wrote: 'Regardless of what Tristan did to me, I was never going to take that moment away from True or Tristan.

'She should not be punished for his actions. He is her father and they both deserve to love one another as deeply as they possibly can.'

After choosing to work on her relationship with Tristan following his cheating while she was pregnant, a scandal with a family friend pushed Khloe over the edge.

The family learnt about Tristan allegedly hooking up with Kylie Jenner's then-best friend Jordyn Woods and it was all caught on camera.

Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air.

Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which helped make Kim and her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall household names and launched their careers in the fashion and beauty business, will air its last season early next year.

There was no reasons for the decision but E! said in a statement that it respects ‘the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras.’ In recent years numerous siblings, most recently Kourtney, have been reluctant to film the show. Kim has also endured a turbulent year with her husband Kanye West’s mental health battle and controversial presidential run putting unprecedented strain on her marriage.

Throughout the years the show chronicled key events in the personal and professional lives of the California family, including Kim Kardashian's marriages to Kris Humphries and West, an armed robbery in Paris, the break-up of Khloe Kardashian's marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom, and the transition of family patriarch Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.

In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, 39, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.

Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.

'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'

'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'

The E! reality show first premiered in 2007, originated with Ryan Seacrest, who served as an executive producer 

In April this year, it was claimed the show had its lowing viewing figures which had sunk to under 900k. 

At its peak, 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.
