Farmers markets have long been associated with delicious produce, fresh flowers, homemade arts and crafts... and now romance.

Australian heartthrob Jacob Elordi recently looked smitten as he took his stunning new girlfriend Kaia Gerber to his local market in New York.

However, fans couldn't help but mock the 23-year-old for spending quality time with the model, 19, at the same spot as his exes, Zendaya and Joey King.

After going public with their romance last week, the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford accompanied Jacob for a sweet stroll through his local farmers market.

However, his eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that it was the same place he took his ex-girlfriend Zendaya to back in March.

It also appears to be the same location he escorted his former flame Joey King to during their romance in 2018.

Fans rushed to Twitter to ridicule him, with one joking: 'jacob elordi be like “i know a place” and then take you where he’s taken every girl he’s ever dated.'
