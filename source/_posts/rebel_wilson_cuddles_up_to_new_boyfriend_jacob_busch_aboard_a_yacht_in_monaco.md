Both Rebel and Jacob wore trendy sunglasses, and wore amused expressions on their faces. 

Rebel showed off her slimmed-down look and angular features, wearing gentle makeup and keeping her hair mostly off her face. 

Jacob wore a crisp grey shirt and poked his tongue between his teeth in a cheeky pose.

Earlier in the day, Rebel flaunted her incredible 18kg weight loss in another Boomerang clip via Instagram. 

After attending an art exhibit at the Villa Paloma Monaco in Monte-Carlo with Jacob, the Australian comedian shared a video of herself twirling on the balcony.  

Rebel has been on a health and fitness journey this year, losing at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).

Elsewhere at the art exhibition on Sunday, Rebel and Jacob met with Prince Albert of Monaco. 

Rebel posed up a storm with the 62-year-old royal when appearing at the art event for renowned Spanish painter Joan Miró.

The beauty made her red carpet debut with Jacob at a gala in Monaco this week. 

While the Isn't It Romantic star and the beer heir held back on any public displays of affection, they are reportedly 'officially boyfriend and girlfriend.'

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser. 

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of US$13.4billion.

Jacob and Rebel's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for the 29-year-old, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59. 

Looking good: Rebel has drastically slimmed down this year after embarking on a health and fitness journey in January
