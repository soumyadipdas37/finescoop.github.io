Teresa Giudice has four children with estranged husband Joe Giudice: Gia, 19, Gabriella, 16, Milania, 15 and Audriana 11.

And on Sunday the 48-year-old Real Housewives Of New Jersey star reminded her followers that she still has an incredible figure.

The pinup shared new images where she was in a bikini as she spent time with her girlfriends in Mantoloking, a borough in Ocean County, New Jersey.

The reality TV sensation was with her pals Jodi Brooke Gladstone, Lisa Fortunato and Kaitlin Parke.

'Suns out, guns out!' said one of her friends while the other remarked, 'Sunday Funday DTS ❤️ Love u' and another wrote, 'Summer time.'

All four women in the photos seemed to be in great shape as they posed away for the camera in swimwear.

Teresa had a very slender tummy as she wore a yellow string bikini.

The star had her breasts augmented earlier this year and took to social media to talk up the procedure with her fans.

'10 Years after my first Breast Augmentation I decided to have my breasts re-done. I am so thankful for Dr. Preminger @premingermd.... I was very nervous to re-do my breasts, but I felt it was necessary for me to feel like my best self,' said the star in January. 

And the TV vet also commented: 'I encourage anyone who doesn’t feel their best self to work on feeling better. Even if it is the smallest thing every day. If it is something that requires cosmetic surgery to feel better I highly recommend Dr. Preminger @premingermd, and could not be happier with the results. I felt like she understood me, and really made me feel comfortable.

'I am grateful to have had such a professional approach.'

Her pride and joy: The brunette shared rare photo with all four of her daughters earlier this summer. The girls are Gia, 19, Gabriella, 16, Milania, 15 and Audriana 11

This comes after the TV icon posed with her four daughters. She said in her caption she loves her kids while adding four heart emojis.

The ladies looked to be near the Jersey Shore where Teresa's brother Joe Gorga owns a home with his wife Melissa.

Teresa looked elegant in a low-cut black romper with neon yellow heels and her long brunette hair worn down.

Her kids were dressed casually in shorts and tank tops with sandals for the afternoon outing.

Daddy Joe: She had the girls with estranged husband Joe Giudice, who has been deported to Italy; a flashback photo

It is likely that they were shooting an episode of RHONJ as the series has resumed production with safety measures in place due to the pandemic.

Interestingly, her girls are almost as tall as she is. 

Teresa shares Audriana and Milania, as well as daughters Gia and Gabriella with ex husband Joe Giudice, 48, who is currently residing in his native Italy after being deported from the United States last year. 

Congrats: Teresa attempted to make the most of graduation in lockdown for daughters Milania and Audriana by presenting each of them with a custom cake earlier this month
