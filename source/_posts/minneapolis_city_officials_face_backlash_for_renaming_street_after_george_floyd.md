Minneapolis city officials are facing backlash for allowing a street to be named after George Floyd who died under the knee of a white police officer in May. 

A stretch of a street in the city that includes the place where Floyd was killed will soon be named in his honor.

Although the street will still be called Chicago Avenue, the city will refer to the blocks between 37th and 39th streets as George Perry Floyd Jr Place. 

The City Council approved the naming Friday, and Mayor Jacob Frey's office said he would likely sign off on it as well.

Following the announcement, several people took to social media to criticize the move.

'I don't think anyone disputes that the officers are wrong and rightfully being charged for George Floyd's death. But now we are naming a street in memory of a criminal? What a joke,' one Twitter user shared. 

Another user wrote: 'When George Floyd, Breanna [sic] Taylor, Atatiana Jefferson, Aura Rosser, Philando Castille, etc were murdered, libs wanted to set guidelines on how to protest and asked to change street names. 

'When RBG dies of cancer though, libs want to tear everything down. See the problem?' 

A third person said: 'It won't be long before someone is killed there, and it won't be by the police.'  

In a tweet, another person made the point that black people want justice instead of having street names changed. 

'Americans be renaming streets like: "George Floyd Jr street" I am sure black folk don't want street names changed. They want justice and change,' the user tweeted.   

Meanwhile, there were others who didn't have a problem with the street being renamed after Floyd

Benjamin Crump, who is representing the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, shared: 'We will continue to make change in our communities in your honor, brother'

A group of demonstrators occupied the area, saying they will not leave until the city meets their demands, including funding for anti-racism training and a temporary property tax freeze for people within that zone

Meanwhile, there were others who didn't have a problem with the street being renamed after Floyd. 

'Conservatives are triggered bc a street will be named after George Floyd but they're perfectly fine with schools being named after slave owners. Make it make sense, y'all,' one person said on Twitter. 

Benjamin Crump, who is representing the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, shared: '3 blocks of the Minneapolis street where #GeorgeFloyd took his last breath will be renamed "George Perry Floyd Jr. Place" in his memory. 

'We will continue to make change in our communities in your honor, brother.' 

Floyd died on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white officer, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck even as Floyd said he couldn't breathe. 

His death was captured in widely seen bystander video that set off protests around the world.

Months after Floyd's death, the intersection remains barricaded and now holds a memorial. 

A group of demonstrators has occupied the area, saying they will not leave until the city meets their demands, including funding for anti-racism training and a temporary property tax freeze for people within that zone.

The city had announced plans to reopen 38th Street this summer but backed off, avoiding a confrontation.

The city continues to work on a long-term plan for the intersection.
