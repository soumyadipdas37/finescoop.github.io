He has been wearing wearing a yellow wristband over the past year during all of his live TV crosses.

And on Thursday, Sunrise weatherman Sam 'Sam Mac' McMillan explained the reason behind the move. 

He said he has donned the bright band to help continue to promote non-profit suicide prevention organisation R U OK?. 

'It's such a tiny thing, but it's meant a lot': Sunrise weatherman Sam Mac has been wearing a R U OK? wristband for the last 12 months during his live TV crosses 

The Channel Seven personality, 37, told news.com.au: 'Initially it was more of a reminder to myself to be more in tune with mental health conversations and to remind myself that you never really know what someone is going through. 

He also said he is often asked by Sunrise viewers through social media or in-person about the band, which has led to open discussions about mental health. 

'It's such a tiny thing but it's meant a lot,' he said of the band.

Sam told the publication that he got involved with R U OK? after the death of his close friend, radio star Richard Marsland, in 2008.

'I remember so clearly the feeling when I got the call about Richard. It's such a sharp, vivid memory and almost instantly I remember wanting to do something to help in that space,' he said.

Sam also shared a post on Instagram on Thursday, showing off the band and reaching out his 122,000 strong followers about the importance of R U OK? and starting a conversation.  

'Almost daily someone writes to me on socials or asks me face to face what the yellow wristband is for. I love that,' he wrote.

Sam continued: 'It's initiated so many meaningful conversations and that's what it's all about. 

'More then ever this year, it's so important to check in on the people you care about.

'I'm doing great, but many aren't. There's more to say after R U Ok?' he added.

Discussions: He also said he is often asked by Sunrise viewers through social media or in-person about the band, which has led to open discussions about mental health
