Drinkers have been caught appearing to defy COVID-19 restrictions by dancing on tables at a pub while signing DJ Ötzi's 2000 hit 'Hey Baby'.

A video shared from the The Club Hotel-Motel at Roma in Queensland on Saturday show pubgoers enjoying their night.

Patrons can be seen jumping on chairs and thumping tables to the song's catchy beat.

Footage also shows them waving their arms in the air and drinking while standing, which goes against the venue's COVID Safe Plan.

People are required to be seated while drinking as part of the state's coronavirus requirements.

It also requires them to remain four square metres apart inside venues, meaning pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels with less than 200sqm of floor space can only host a maximum of 50 people.

An investigation into the footage at The Club Hotel-Motel has been launched, with  an Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation spokeswoman telling The Courier-Mail 'we are looking into the matter' after a complaint was received.

Club Hotel-Motel licensee Felicity Waldron said the complaint was, however, 'a whole lot of crap'.

She believed the venue was 'probably the only one in town' to comply with COVID Safe rules and said she was confident CCTV would rectify any breaches. 

Ms Waldron blamed the complaint on competitors who have suffered throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

'One guy was on a table for about 10 seconds before he was asked to get down,' she told The Courier-Mail.

'The police were here with body worn cameras.'

A number of businesses in regional Queensland have been fined for breaching COVID-19 safety regulations.

These include the Commonwealth Hotel and Royal on Ninety-Nine in Roma, the Federal Hotel in Wallumbilla and the Injune Hotel.

Queensland Police said in July the businesses failed to restrict patron numbers appropriately, implement social distancing, appropriately maintain guest registries and restrict people from gathering around bars, according to Drinks Trade.

Pubs have also been fined in Sydney, including the Phoenix Hotel in Woollahra, the Garry Owen Hotel in Rozelle, the Golden Sheaf Hotel in Double Bay and the Watsons Bay Hotel.

Clubs including the Zhivago nightclub in South Australia and Melbourne's Love Machine, among others, have also been fined for COVID-19 breaches since the pandemic began.

The Queensland Hotels Association in July said enforcing the no-standing rule in licensed venues was 'virtually impossible'.

Queensland Hotels Association chief executive Bernie Hogan said the ban added 'an additional level of complexity'.

'This is a frustration that will have the public more confused and less engaged in keeping themselves safe or adhering to restrictions,' he told AAP.

His comments followed Health Minister Steven Miles saying the ban was 'not too much to sacrifice to keep the doors open and keep all those workers employed.'

'We do not want to get to the point where we have to close down businesses again,' he said.
