They were first linked romantically back in May.

And Ashley Benson and G-Eazy looked closer than ever on Thursday, with the couple snapped kissing and hugging in Mailbu.

The PDA packed display took place during a break in filming from G-Eazy's -whose real name is Gerald Earl Gillum- latest music video.

The rapper at one point leaned down to give his actress girlfriend a passionate kiss, as she wrapped her arms around his back.

The diminutive blonde beauty and the 6ft4in musician later hugged, with Benson's hands resting on her man's behind.  

The Spring Breakers actress was previously in a relationship with supermodel Cara Delevingne, but they parted ways earlier this year.

Benson and the beauty, who had initially been linked since a PDA session in London in August 2018, parted ways this past April.

Benson and G-Eazy - who was previously linked to Halsey, Victoria's Secret model Yasmin Wijnaldum, Megan Thee Stallion and Lana Del Rey - were initially spotted with one another on May 10 during a shopping trip, and seen kissing a few days later.

Delevingne stood up for her ex on Instagram Stories in May when Benson irritated some fans stepping out so soon with G-Eazy after their split.

'It’s more important now than ever to spread love, not hate,' the model said on Instagram Stories.
