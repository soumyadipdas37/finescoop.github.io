Michelle Keegan is set to become a WAG after husband Mark Wright confirmed he's pursuing a career in professional football.

The presenter, 33, told MailOnline he has 'one last shot' at turning pro after admitting he wrecked his chances as a youth player at Tottenham Hotspur by not dedicating his life to the sport.

In an exclusive interview, Mark reveals he's turned down an approach from non-league side Billericay Town and is targeting a move to a club towards the top end of the football spectrum – and wants to document his journey on a TV show.

'I am toying with the idea': Michelle Keegan is set to become a WAG after husband Mark Wright confirmed he's pursuing a career in professional football

Mark, whose younger brother Josh plays for League 2 side Leyton Orient, said: 'I would definitely debate pursuing football. Before it's too late that's something I would love to do.

'I am toying with the idea of having one last shot. I have been thinking about it lately. But if I do it, it has to be now because I'm 33.

'I came away from football too young if you ask me. I ruined my career by my own faults when I was 21 and it's something that has always stuck with me.

'I have definitely been toying with the idea and will review it over the next month and decide if I want to give it a go.

Dream: The presenter said he has 'one last shot' at turning pro after admitting he wrecked his chances as a youth player at Tottenham Hotspur by not dedicating his life to the sport

'I was asked to go to Billericay Town but if I think if I was to do it – Billericay are a great club but if I was to do it I'd want to play for the professional leagues because that would be the whole point. 

'I played at Billericay's level for a while when I was young but the thing I never did was play for the football professional league because I retired too young so if I could go back and give it that one shot and document it for a TV show, that's what I'd want.'

Mark, who married actress Michelle, 33, in 2015, explained his dream of becoming a pro footballer was left in tatters after he started partying in clubs, instead of staying committed to his fitness.

Now, after launching his career on TOWIE, the star said not reaching his full potential on the pitch is one of his biggest regrets in life.

He continued: 'I was flying when I was at Tottenham as a youth team player and I was pushing to play in the first team but I went away one summer and didn't train and took my foot off the gas.

'I went back to training and I was overweight and unfit. I was out of shape and not the player I once was and I lost my confidence, which ruined my career.

'I am so driven now as I remember that moment and what I did and I don't want it to ever happen again.'

Mark launched his presenting career in the US by starring alongside Mario Lopez on TV show Extra.

He left the role after two years in 2019 to move back to the UK and spend more time with wife Michelle. 

'I miss home too much': Mark, who married actress Michelle Keegan in 2015, hopes to further his career stateside, but vows not to move on a permanent basis due to missing his family 

But Mark still hopes to land further work stateside, though he's now against moving there for good. 

He said: 'I would always love to work in America but I wouldn't like to live there again.

'If I was to do a show in America I'd like it to be a series so it comes and ago for a couple of months.

'I love Los Angeles so much and I love the American audience. I don't want to live there again because I miss home too much but I would definitely work out there again.'

Mark has teamed up with mobile game Candy Crush to launch their first ever tournament, where he will set challenges and appear as a character within the saga.

Capital Breakfast host Roman Kemp is set to host the tournament while Laura Whitmore and Alesha Dixon will be joined by Rachel Riley, Adebayo Akinfenwa and Mark as 'celebrity scouts.'

The finale is taking place on October 13 and the winner will scoop the title of the nation's top Crusher.

'My involvement is that I will be setting the players challenges and we are helping to get the message out there so that the most amount of people are involved. It's one big moment for Candy Crush players and a really clever idea from them.'
