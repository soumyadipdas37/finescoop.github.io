The EU is set to sideline Michel Barnier to try to crack the Brexit negotiations deadlock, it was reported tonight.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to stand Brussels' chief negotiator aside to help bring about a trade deal with the UK.

Heads of the 27 remaining member states are believed to be taking over the role after a speech from Mrs von der Leyen on September 16.

They hope the move will heal divisions - with Britain and the EU blaming each other for the stalemate - between the two sides as the timer on negotiations ticks down.

An EU diplomat told the Telegraph Mrs von der Leyen is expected to 'set the scene to sideline Barnier and [the UK's David] Frost to find a high level political solution'.

Each country has an Exclusive Economic Zone which can extend up to 200 nautical miles from the coast. 

That country has special fishing rights over that area. 

However, in the EU each country's Exclusive Economic Zone is effectively merged into one joint EU zone. 

All fishing activity within that zone is then regulated by the bloc's controversial Common Fisheries Policy which dictates how many of each type of fish can be caught.

The joint EU zone is open to fishermen from every member state. 

But after the Brexit transition period the UK will regain sole control of its Exclusive Economic Zone and the bolstered Royal Navy Fishery Protection Squadron will be tasked with patrolling it to make sure every vessel operating there has the right to do so.

The European Commission president, German chancellor Angela Merkel and President of the European Council Charles Michel 'will then lead talks' for the EU.

The Commission would not be drawn on the 'State of the Union' speech when approached by the Telegraph.

It comes as Lord Frost warned Brussels' demands on fishing and state subsidies could 'limit the progress' made in talks next week.

In a sign the UK could be edging closer to a No Deal Brexit, Mr Frost said: 'The EU still insists we change our positions on state aid and fisheries if there are to be substantive textual discussions on anything else.

'From the very beginning we have been clear about what we can accept in these areas, which are fundamental to our status as an independent country.

'We will negotiate constructively but the EU's stance may, realistically, limit the progress we can make next week.'

His comments on Twitter came after Mr Barnier said while Britain can regain control of its waters, 'the fish which are inside those waters' are 'another story'.

The bloc wants to retain access for its fishing boats, but No 10 is adamant that British trawlers will be given priority.

Brussels is also demanding a 'level playing field' on state aid rules, which would effectively tie Britain to EU regulations after the transition period finishes at the end of the year.

Boris Johnson insisted yesterday the UK will 'prosper mightily' regardless of the outcome of the trade talks.

Asked about hauliers' concerns about chaos at the border, Mr Johnson said: 'We're ready for any eventuality, of course.

'But we must make sure that people understand that, at the end of the year, whatever happens, we are leaving the EU, leaving the transition period. We will get through this.

The EU is demanding continued access to UK waters for the bloc's fishing boats but Number 10 is adamant that British trawlers will be given priority. A fishing vessel is pictured working in the English Channel on August 10 

This map shows the extent of the UK's Exclusive Economic Zone - the waters Britain will take back control of after Brexit. At the moment the EEZ of every EU member state is merged into one large zone which can be accessed by fishermen from all over Europe.

'It's absolutely vital that our partners understand that the UK is going to do what we need to do.'

The Road Haulage Association is among seven logistics groups which have written to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, warning that the supply chain from the EU will be 'severely disrupted' next year without urgent action to plug 'significant gaps' in our preparations.

A No 10 spokesman said in response: 'We have been working closely with industry throughout and will continue to do so. We will get through this.'
