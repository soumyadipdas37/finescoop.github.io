In fact, shoppers claim the long-sleeved top is a wardrobe staple and just the thing to see you through all seasons and occasions. 

'Attractive, classy, classic, versatile blouse' wrote one enthusiastic shopper. 'This style of blouse can go well with a variety of outfits from dressy to semi-casual. And black always goes with anything. Very pleased with the style and fit of this blouse.'

Another shopper agreed, adding: 'Such a great, classic look. Lightweight but not see-through' they went on to write 'looks great with dress pants and heels, or with jeans and a leather coat. Dress up or down!'

Despite the very affordable price tag, shoppers are impressed with the quality of the blouse, praising it as 'flattering', 'well-fitted' and 'elegant'.    

A polished wardrobe essential, the blouse has been designed with a small stand-up collar with a frill that continues down the button band, voluminous sleeves and buttoned cuffs

One delighted shopper penned: 'I didn't expect this to be such an Elegant top!!!! It is SO well made, perfect stitching and beautiful finishes!!! It looks so delicate and classy with the ruffled button placket!!! Flowing Soft classy material seems like Chiffon.'

'There are so many things to like about this blouse' added another shopper. 'The fabric has a nice feel and drape - and it is not at all flimsy. That said, it isn't so heavy that it would be too warm to wear in warmer weather. The fit is also nice - it isn't form-fitting, but neither is it so flowy that it wouldn't work under a jacket. It looks nice on its own, but also under something.'
