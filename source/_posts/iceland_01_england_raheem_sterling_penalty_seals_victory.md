Late drama bubbled over during England's UEFA Nations League clash away to Iceland, after two last-gasp penalty kicks at either end providing a hero and villain scenario, with Raheem Sterling coming out on top for England.

Both given for handball, Sterling converted for England before Joe Gomez was immediately deemed to have handled the ball at the opposite end. Birkir Bjarnason stepped up, but could only blaze his attempt over the crossbar.

Gareth Southgate's side believed they had made early headway in the contest, after Raheem Sterling's low searching cross was poked in by Harry Kane at the far post. The goal appeared above board, only for officials to make a questionable offside call without the use of VAR in operation.

England's task became that little bit harder on 70 minutes, after defender Kyle Walker received a second yellow card for a rash tackle on Arnor Traustason and given his marching orders.

90+3min: Incredible!  Bjarnason blasts it straight over the bar! What a let-off for England.

90+1min: Joe Gomez concedes a penalty for a foul on Fridjonsson

90+1min: Raheem Sterling scored but there is a twist...

89min: I'll take the assist for that thank you very much. Raheem Sterling picks up a cross at the back post but his shot is blocked by the hand of Sverrir Ingason who is sent off for a second yellow.

86min: Looks like Iceland have England's number at international level. Could they be the Three Lion's bogey team now? This will be the second match in-a-row where England have laboured in front of goal throughout almost the entire 90 minutes Remember their goal at Euro 2016 came from a Wayne Rooney (remember him?) penalty.

1 - Kyle Walker is the first player to be sent off for the England men's team since Raheem Sterling vs Ecuador in June 2014. Orders.

81min: It's just not been England's evening. They have not created a single worthwhile chance in this half and look like they could play until the end of the month and still not score. Iceland sense they could still pinch something on the counter attack...

78min: England continue to attack with 10 men as Harry Kane makes way for debutant Mason Greenwood.

76min: Traustason  departs as he is replaced by free agent Emil Hallfredsson who was once on Tottenham's books 14 years ago.

73min: Here is that rethink. Jadon Sanco departs for Trent Alexander-Arnold who will fill in the spot vacated by Walker.

70min: Time for an instant rethink for Southgate. Kyle Walker on a booking is just a little too late with a sliding tackle on Traustason, and he can have little complaint to see the red card.

68min: Here is Plan B for England, and it's 'Operation support for Harry Kane' as Phil Foden makes way after a solid debut to be replaced by Danny Ings.

66min: The first change is with iceland as Jon Porsteinsson is replaced by Arnor Sigurdsson - no relation to Everton start Gylfi but he does have the midfielder's No 10 shirt.

65min: It wasn't bad. Kieran Trippier's ball into the box is nodded wide for a corner, but from that set-piece theball then is diverted behind for a goal kick,

63min: Rare free-kick out wide on the left for England, can the Three Lions trouble from a set-piece?

60min: England upping the tempo with mixed success. Finally they breach Iceland's backline with a clever long pass to Jadon Sancho on the byline but his ball into the box is disappointing as it sails out for a goal kick.

57min: A couple of set-piece worries from Iceland but coming up to the hour mark it has otherwise just been walking football pace with England having all the possession. I just wonder if Southgate is thinking of a Plan B - there are certainly no changes on the way right now.

54min: Well as least Declan Rice got a shot away this time. Harry Kane plays a pass into his path on the edge of the box, but with a first time effort he blasts way off target.

51min: Early days of course but there has been no change in the pattern of this game. All England on the ball but they cannot fathom a chance. Plenty of attacks coming down the left but Raheem Sterling is being left with nothing but blind alleys to go down.

48min: Early corner in this period for England but despite the ball played into the box trickling through the box after a deflection, there are no takers as the hosts bring the ball to safety.

52 - Both Joe Gomez (57) and Eric Dier (53) completed more passes than Iceland (52) in the first-half, with no Iceland player having more than nine successful passes. Contrast.

About 10 minutes after Kane's disallowed goal there was a chance for Declan Rice to tap home a byline Jadon Sancho at the near post...only to get his feet in a muddle, kick the ball against himself and then allowing Iceland to clear. Doh!

Was Harry Kane offside? Judge for yourself. Here is the final touch before the striker picked up a Raheem Sterling cross from the left to slide the ball home. He certainly looks onside to me.

43min: Any chance of blowing early for half-time, ref to save us a few minutes? Any? No? Fine.

40min: A booking each now, with Ingason cautioned for bringing down Eric Dier near the halfway line.

37min: Heading into the final 10 minutes of the first half and it is Iceland who will be happier with how this match is playing out. England's attack has withered as this first period has developed and they really look like they are going nowhere right now.

34min: Panic over though as Pickford comfortably sees Arnor Traustason's free-kick curl well wide.

33min: Concern for England as Kyle Walker is booked cor tripping an Icelandic attacker on the corner of the England box as the hosts win a free-kick in a dangerous position.

30min: Nice. An actual shot on goal. It was never going in during a moth of Sundays but Raheem Sterling's low shot from just outside the box just lacked the power to trouble the keeper Hannes Halldorsson.

27min: England continue to dominate the ball but the Iceland defence are coping comfortably with the low tempo dictated by Southgate's side so far. Blue shirts always seem to be everywhere in and around the penalty box.

24min: Remember the early Premier League matches that resumed after lockdown and just never got going? This match is following a very similar pattern. Chances let along goals are at a premium right now.

21min: Iceland win a corner but all of their-set-pieces have so far been well dealt with by the England defence. Jordan Pickford doing well to pluck a high looping cross out of the air.

18min: It's not quite happened for England in the last 10 minutes. The chances have dried up and Iceland are starting to become a little more confident when it comes to breaking away on the counter attack.

15min: Not much happening on the pitch right now, but Southgate has seen enough to start furiously scribbling some notes into his pad on the touchline. It of course could be him trying to think of his shopping list - who knows?

12min: Iceland to their credit have defended well so far. England looking confident going forward though which is one improvement from four years ago.

9min: This has been a good start for England as they continue to apply the pressure. Kyle Walker lets fly with a rising drive towards the near post that is pushed behind.

6min: Harry Kane has another chance as he slides home at the back post (below) but the goal is rather questionably ruled out for offside. There is no VAR today, and it's rather unfortunate because I think that would have gone in England's favour.

3min: It's a back four for England with Kieran Trippier lining up at left-back as his former Tottenham Hotspur team-mate Harry Kane tests the Iceland keeper with an early shot at goal that is well saved.

Iceland were forced into a change in the warm up, with Sigthorsson replaced by Gudmundsson.

International football may be back but the supporters still aren't. National anthems feel very strange without at least a partisan nation cheering on the home side.

Oh we do? Fine. Well it was four years ago at Euro 2016 when Iceland stunned England to come from behind and dump them out of Euro 2016 2-1 in the last-16, bringing an to Roy Hodgson's reign. Now, moving on please...

His Everton form has raised doubts over his claims to be England's No 1 keeper but he keeps his jersey for now. How he could do with a solid evening in Reykjavik as the England players warm up.

Don't panic though. From an England perspective it's only a minor alteration from last time. Keeping it simple we will focus on how it England will hope to use the tournament.

Instead of three teams in their group, they now have four including Iceland, Belgium and Denmark. As they are in the top League (League A) along with three other groups, they would advance to next year's semi-finals if they top their group. If they finish bottom they would be relegated to League B. Each team plays each other twice and that brings us to today's opener in Iceland.

The ol' standard pitch inspection before the warm up...

Here is how the hosts will line up...

Several big players have missed out for England today.

Harry Maguire was dropped from the squad entirely, while Trent Alexander-Arnold, Tyrone Mings, Ben Chilwell, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Harry Winks and Callum Hudson-Odoi have all dropped out.

It's certainly an interesting selection from Gareth Southgate.

Just three players who started against Kosovo all those months ago have kept their places - and they are Declan Rice, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling.

Phil Foden, as expected, and James Ward-Prowse start from the off.

It looks as though Kieran Trippier is the man who will start at left back this evening.

England's last game, a 4-0 win in Kosovo last November, feels a world away. They topped their Euro 2020 qualifying group in style before the tournament itself was pushed back to next year due to the pandemic.

The lengthy pause means there's now a very different look to the current Three Lions group. Sportsmail took a look at who is involved, and who has missed out.

It appears Phil Foden is about to be handed his first senior start for England.

The ten month break has seen Gareth Southgate eager to freshen up his side for this one and the impressive midfielder has been given the nod, according to Sky Sports.

Welcome along to Sportsmail's live coverage of England's first international clash since November!

Gareth Southgate's men have travelled to Iceland for the first fixture of the new Nations League campaign, and they will be aiming to mark their return to action with a good result.

A host of uncapped players will also be hoping for their first taste of senior action today, and there's good news for a certain Manchester City wonderkid...

Kick off in Reykjavik is at 5pm GMT.
