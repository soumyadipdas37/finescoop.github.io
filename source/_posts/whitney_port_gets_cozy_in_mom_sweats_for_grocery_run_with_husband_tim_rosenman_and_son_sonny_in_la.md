Whitney Port has been keeping busy during the global COVID-19 pandemic, launching a new fashion collab over the summer.

But the TV personality is also getting in plenty of quality family time, as she quarantines with her husband and son.

She got cozy Monday in her mom sweats, as she made a family grocery run with husband Tim Rosenman and son Sonny in Los Angeles, during a break from quarantine.

The 35-year-old donned a grey t-shirt, which she tucked partially into a pair of off-white sweatpants, worn high on her waist.

She finished the ensemble with a beige baseball cap, a white face mask and a pair of white New Balance kicks.  

Port previously took to Instagram with a glimpse at her weekend look, as well as her yoga session with Rosenman, 43.

Port previously told Page Six: 'As a multitasking mom, I gravitate toward pieces that can be easily mixed and matched, or one-piece dresses you can throw on.'

She added: 'At the beginning of quarantine, I had very much given into the fact that it didn’t really matter what I looked like, that it was just all about sweats and being comfortable and not caring because nobody was seeing me.'

The fashion blogger launched a capsule collection with Rent the Runway in July, which prioritized eco-friendliness with recycled fabrics and sustainable cotton.

She said of the 19-piece Love, Whit collection: 'Renting is a great way to be sustainably involved in fashion.'
