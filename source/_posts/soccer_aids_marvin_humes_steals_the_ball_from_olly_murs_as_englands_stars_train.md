Soccer Aid star Marvin Humes was showing off his sporting skills as the England players completed their last day of training before the charity match on Sunday.

The DJ managed to steal the ball away from Olly Murs during a practise game, as the team prepared to go head-to-head with the World XI team at Old Trafford in Manchester.

It comes after Soccer Aid 2020 was delayed from its usual start date in June due to concerns sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, with this year's match being the first in its history to be played behind closed doors.

Marvin donned his England training kit as he joined singer Olly on the pitch and to his clear upset succeeded in tackling the ball from him.

The pair showed off their skills under the watchful eyes of managers Sam Allardyce and Wayne Rooney. 

Mark Wright is also set to return to the Three Lions side for the charity after making his Soccer Aid debut back in 2016.

Star-studded: The England side has seen an array of stars taking part since Soccer Aid began back in 2006

Last month Kem admitted he came close to pulling out of the matching after tearing his hamstring during training.

He told The Sun: 'I was pushing myself too hard and one day I heard it pop and I was in agony. It happened about three weeks before the game. 

'It started bruising up straight away so I knew it was bad. The next day I saw the physio and he said I'd torn it.

Funnyman: Comedian John Bishop has also made a return to the England squad

Getting in shape: Love Island narrator Iain Stirling led the stars from the World XI in the midst of training

'He was like, 'Realistically you probably shouldn't play but we can give it our best shot', so I'm just hoping for the best.

'I'd rather get injured again in the game and play a bit than watch on the side and feel gutted. I'll just see how I get on.

His reality star pal, Mark Wright, reportedly suffered a similar fate in 2019 when he tore his hamstring.

He was able to battle through and make it onto the Soccer Aid pitch alongside the likes of Mo Farah and Joe Wicks, and he has been guiding Kem through his recovery.   

The match will broadcast live on ITV, with coverage once again hosted by Dermot O'Leary.

Soccer Aid was founded in 2006 by singer Robbie Williams and Jonathan Wilkes to raise funds for UNICEF UK, with this year's funds going to Generation COVID, which will directly help those whose lives have been impacted by coronavirus.
