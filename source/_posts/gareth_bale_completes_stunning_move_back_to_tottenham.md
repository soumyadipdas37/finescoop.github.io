Gareth Bale completed his emotional return to Tottenham on Wednesday night in a move that was driven by Jose Mourinho.

The Wales international has agreed terms on a year-long deal that Sportsmail understands to be worth more than £13million – part of which will be financed by Real Madrid – and he is relishing the prospect of relaunching his career at the club that propelled him to stardom.

There is no indication yet as to when Tottenham – who face Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the Europa League on Thursday – will make an official announcement but it will happen once a few minor contractual issues are signed.

Gareth Bale has sealed a sensational return to Tottenham to end his Real Madrid nightmare

Bale rose to superstardom at Tottenham before leaving seven years ago to join Real Madrid

Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is said to have played a key role in bringing Bale back to Spurs

Bale's return to North London, seven years after he was sold to Madrid for a the world record fee of £90million, is laced with sentiment but it was a move that Mourinho, Tottenham's manager, felt was absolutely imperative following his side's dismal 1-0 defeat to Everton last Sunday.

Mourinho was adamant that Tottenham needed Bale's driven and dynamism to enliven Tottenham's attack and negotiations accelerated following discussion with Chairman Daniel Levy. 

It is understood no players will go in the opposite direction.

The deal for Bale stands a separate transaction as Tottenham will also Sergio Reguilon, Real Madrid's left-back who has also been linked with Manchester United, today; He is due to undergo a medical and will sign a five-year with Tottenham, paying £27million fee.
