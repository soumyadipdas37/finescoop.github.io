Celebrities came to the defense of Two and a Half Men alum Jon Cryer following his Twitter tirade against Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz on Saturday.

The feud was originally sparked after the 55-year-old native New Yorker announced he donated to the 38-year-old Republican politician's Democratic opponent Phil Ehrin.

'Rep. @mattgaetz invited a white supremacist to the State of the Union,' Jon wrote, correctly referring to alt right activist Charles C. Johnson.

'[Matt] attempted to intimidate a federal witness [Michael Cohen], and endorsed a sociopathic bigot [Laura Loomer] who applauded the deaths of migrants for congress.'

Gaetz directly responded to Cryer by making a reference to his former onscreen brother: 'Charlie Sheen totally carried two and a half men.'

At that, Cryer - who boasts 391K Twitter/Facebook followers - replied: 'Is that why, after he left, it lasted for 4 more years and I won an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy?'

Technically, the Supergirl star received two Emmy Awards for his portrayal of struggling chiropractor Alan Harper in all 262 episodes of the CBS sitcom, which aired for 12 seasons between 2003–2015.

Sheen's bad boy character was notoriously killed off the hit show in 2011 following three rehab stints and a public meltdown against creator Chuck Lorre, who replaced Charlie with Ashton Kutcher.

The Donald Trump defender then belittled Jon's Emmy wins by replying: 'What's an Emmy? An award Hollywood gives itself? I win elections.'

Cryer stressed that Matt 'can't say [Sheen] "carried" a show that lasted four years without him,' but clarified he wasn't underplaying his disgraced 55-year-old ex-castmate's talents.

'And FWIW, this wasn't meant as a slam on Charlie,' the Big Time Adolescence actor tweeted on Sunday.

Comedian Patton Oswalt then re-tweeted the feud and hilariously referred to Jon's 1986 breakout role as Philip 'Duckie' Dalekie in Pretty in Pink, cracking: 'Don't. F***. With. Duckie'

'In addition to being a loathsome person, he is also a dreadful television critic': Star Wars legend Mark Hamill also showed his support for Cryer by re-tweeting the exchange

'He was undeniably the star of the show. And a fantastic actor. Despite his issues, we had many more highs than lows.'

The SAG Award nominee - who endorsed John McCain for president in 2008 - will next reprise his recurring role as supervillain Lex Luthor in the sixth season of Supergirl, which premieres 'midseason 2021' on The CW.
