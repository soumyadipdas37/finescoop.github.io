In a preview for an upcoming episode of The Bachelor Australia, the contestants are left reeling when an intruder enters the competition. 

In the clip, host Osher Gunsberg holds a group Zoom meeting for the remaining girls, where they see footage of the mystery blonde. 

Roxi Kenny, 29, looks aghast as she views the footage of the woman, who is shown from behind, hiking in skin-tight workout gear.

'She's so good looking it actually hurts my soul!' Roxi exclaims in shock, hugging herself and rocking back and worth. 

Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, also views the footage, and reveals she feels a bit offended by the addition of a new woman. 

'It's a bit of a punch in the d**ck,' she complains with a laugh, but seems less than amused.

Loves it! Very impressed is Bachelor Locky, 30, who beams after watching footage of the woman taking a swim

One person who appears very impressed is Bachelor Locky Gilbert, 30, who beams after watching footage of the woman taking a swim. 

'She's frickin' amazing!' he says, leaning back and stroking his chin with a stunned look on his face. 

A clearly delighted Locky looks already smitten as he adds: 'All the boxes are being ticked!'

Osher revealed why producers decided to continue The Bachelor via Zoom rather than abandon the series when COVID-19 hit.

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph this week, the 46-year-old explained that it didn't make sense to stop the season altogether.

'We were pretty deep into filming and it didn't make sense to abandon the series, and we knew we had to finish it,' he told the publication.

'These people had all put their lives on the line hoping to find love and we wanted to give them that chance so we did everything we could to make that happen,' Osher said.

The Bachelor was forced to suspend on-site production of the show back in March.

In a world first, The Bachelor continued production via digital means, including Zoom.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
