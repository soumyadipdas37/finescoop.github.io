He appalled his three brothers and his redoubtable mother last year when he sold the splendid London HQ of The Lady, the stateliest and oldest of Britain’s women’s magazines, founded by his great-grandfather in 1885.

But Ben Budworth, who pocketed £12.4 million from the sale and lives in splendour at Bylaugh Hall in Norfolk, has not lost his talent for antagonising his family.

I can disclose that his brothers Richard, William and Adam, and their mother, Julia, have just learned that Budworth has taken advantage of emergency coronavirus legislation to put himself on furlough, trousering nearly £2,500-a-month of taxpayers’ money in the process.

‘I haven’t heard from him for months,’ 88-year-old Julia, a cousin of the spirited Mitford sisters, tells me. ‘He won’t answer letters, he won’t answer telephone calls — he’s a nightmare, frankly, a nightmare to the whole family.

‘I don’t know what has happened to him. It’s very sad. He was a jolly boy. Somehow he changed. We’re horrified, horrified, horrified. There’s no other word — and that’s not strong enough — for the way he’s behaved.

'The boys — his brothers — are absolutely shattered.’ Budworth, 56, who succeeded his uncle Tom — Julia’s brother — at the helm of The Lady in 2008, is unabashed. 

‘I furloughed myself,’ he tells me from Bylaugh Hall where he keeps his private helicopter. ‘We’ve got four — five — staff on furlough at the moment. I am [one of them]. I can still undertake directorial and statutory duties.’

This is particularly convenient, as he recently married his long-term girlfriend, Helen Robinson, pictured with Budworth. ‘As my wife is the [magazine’s] managing director, we work as a team. She does her bit and I do mine.’

And Budworth is eager to scotch suggestions that The Lady is on the point of being put into voluntary liquidation. 

These have been prompted by documents filed at Companies House which record the voting rights of each class of share in the business — and in any ‘distribution [of funds] arising from a winding-up of the company’.

‘There is absolutely nothing that is not routine in any of that,’ Budworth assures me, insisting that the suggestions are ‘b******s with a capital “B” ’.

Hollywood director Rupert Sanders, who divorced aristocratic model Liberty Ross after enjoying a fling with Twilight star Kristen Stewart, has found love again.

London-born Sanders, 49, is now courting Alexandra Keating, 35, the youngest daughter of former Australian prime minister Paul Keating.

And the pair have been painted in a double portrait that was entered in the Archibald Prize Down Under.

Artist Oliver Watts says of Alexandra: ‘She’s really a special person — very clever, very charismatic. She is happy that Rupert is her boyfriend.’

Boris Johnson lifted his spirits while recovering from coronavirus by rewatching one of his favourite films, Withnail And I. And now its director, Bruce Robinson, has compared the PM to the hapless protagonist of his cult classic comedy. 

‘We have Withnail as a prime minister in a weird way,’ Robinson claims. ‘He’s this boy from Eton spouting f***ing stupid “Tempus Omnia Revelat” b******s all over the place. He is like a Withnail.’

The film version of Martin Amis’s London Fields was one of the biggest flops in recent history and is now best known for its leading lady, Amber Heard, accusing her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, of suspecting she was conducting an affair with her co-star Billy Bob Thornton.

Harrow-educated producer Hamish McAlpine, who now lives in Dublin, says he had a lucky escape from the debacle, having originally been a co-producer before he quit the film in pre-production.

The £6.4 million film took just £340,000 at the box office.

‘I withdrew when I realised the direction it was going in,’ he tells me at a private view of the Tales From The Colony Rooms show at Dellasposa Gallery, near London’s Hyde Park. ‘I joke that I was one of the biggest winners from that film, as I only lost £30,000!’

Adventurer Ben Fogle once thought about surgery to reduce his large nose, but has come to love it.

He reveals: ‘I often get asked about my nose. It’s quite large and it’s often red. I use sunscreen and I don’t drink red wine. I was born with it.

‘As a child I was teased mercilessly about my “massive nose”. I hated it. I considered surgery but eventually I grew to love my nose.

‘It has weathered the Atlantic, Everest and even frostbite in Antarctica.’

Rose Leslie, who played feisty Ygritte (below) in sex and dragons drama Game Of Thrones, enjoys a challenge off screen, too.

The aristocratic actress, 33, who is married to fellow Thrones star Kit Harington, says she enjoys nothing better than plunging into icy waters — with no wetsuit.

‘If I come across a lake or stream, I’m always drawn to jumping in and immersing myself in the cold water,’ says Rose, who was raised at Lickleyhead Castle, her family’s 15th-century ancestral seat in Aberdeenshire.

‘It’s a thrill. I love cold water swimming — running into the North Sea, which is freezing.

‘I read that it kick-starts your immune system and helps alleviate anxiety and stress — so I’m trying to prove that.’

Delays to the release of the Top Gun sequel have ruined the plans of former culture minister Ed Vaizey for a surprise Tom Cruise-themed birthday gift for his wife, Alex.

‘I met Tom Cruise at a Bafta dinner when I was the film minister years and years ago,’ he says. ‘We got on well enough that he arranged a screening of Top Gun, a favourite of my wife’s. So I had this fantasy — this is a significant year for my wife — that I would do a surprise screening of Top Gun 2.

‘However, all my romantic plans have gone by the wayside. But I’m glad to know that Tom is in the country, so I can look him up and take him out to dinner.’

Television historian Dan Snow admits his inspiration is Indiana Jones, the Hollywood hero played by Harrison Ford.

‘Anyone who makes history programmes thinks they’re Indiana Jones,’ he confesses to Susannah Constantine on her podcast, My Wardrobe Malfunction. ‘

Anyone who tells you that’s not true is lying — from senior academics to complete jokers like me who have no business being there.

‘I had a little Indiana Jones hat and I loved it, I took it everywhere.’

Don't expect to see movie heart-throb Jude Law at Glastonbury next summer — he’s more likely to be at a cheese-rolling contest.

‘As I have got a bit older I have drifted back more towards the sort of Lewes bonfire-type festivals and cheese rolling,’ says The Talented Mr Ripley star, 47.

‘I find them a bit more engaging. I have come full circle. Back in the early Eighties my mum went off to Glastonbury and it was really niche.

‘It was hippy and dog-on-a-string, and when I went you could get in free if you were crafty about it.’
