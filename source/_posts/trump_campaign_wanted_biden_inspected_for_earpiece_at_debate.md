President Donald Trump's campaign wanted a third-party to inspect Democrat Joe Biden's ear at Tuesday night's presidential debate to ensure he wasn't wearing an earpiece. 

Fox News Channel reported the request Tuesday morning as more details surfaced about the negotiations the two campaigns are having with the Commission on Presidential Debates. 

The story broke in the hours following Trump's personal lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, going on 'Fox & Friends' and accusing the 77-year-old Biden of suffering 'dementia.' 

The Trump campaign wanted a third-party to inspect Democrat Joe Biden's (left) ears to ensure he wasn't wearing an earpiece to Tuesday night's presidential debate. President Donald Trump (right) reportedly agreed to being inspected 

The first presidential debate will take place Tuesday night in Cleveland, Ohio. The Biden campaign asked for two breaks during the 90-minute face-off, Fox News Channel reported, but the Trump campaign wouldn't go for it 

Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani (right) floated on 'Fox & Friends' Tuesday morning that Joe Biden was suffering from 'dementia,' telling the hosts that he had talked to doctors about it. Steve Doocy (left) pushed back and told Giuliani, 'that's your opinion'  

'The man has dementia. There's no doubt about it. I've talked to doctors, I've had them look at 100 different tapes of his, five years ago and today,' Giuliani told the hosts.  

'He can't recite the Pledge of Allegiance and he's fine,' Giuliani said sarcastically. 

The ex-mayor claimed Biden had 'middle level dementia' and then said the Democratic nominee showed signs of the 'fifth symptom of dementia.' 

'He's got eight out of 10,' Giuliani claimed.   

 'I think the president is quite right to say maybe he's taking Adderall or some kind of Attention Deficit Disorder thing,' Trump's lawyer said. 

Host Steve Doocy interjected, 'that's your opinion,' pointing out that Giuliani wasn't a doctor.  

'It's just not my opinion, it's the opinion of a number of doctors I've interviewed,' Giuliani shot back.  

There's been mixed messaging from Trump world about Biden in the run-up to Tuesday night's first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Trump and his allies have tried to push the narrative that Biden's not 'all there,' while at the same time the Trump campaign told lawmakers and their staff Monday that Biden's debating skills shouldn't be underestimated.  

During debate negotations, Fox reported that Trump agreed to have his ears inspected. 

The president has also pushed Biden to take a drug test, suggesting that his debate performance was much improved when he debated Sen. Bernie Sanders in March, compared to previous Democratic debates where multiple candidates were involved. 

Fox also reported that the Biden campaign requested two breaks during the 90 minute face-off - one every 30 minutes. 

The Trump campaign declined. 

In 2016, Hillary Clinton was briefly accused of wearing an earpiece  - or an 'ear pearl' - to get help during a presidential forum. 

Trump never fully embraced the conspiracy theory, but his son Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about it.
