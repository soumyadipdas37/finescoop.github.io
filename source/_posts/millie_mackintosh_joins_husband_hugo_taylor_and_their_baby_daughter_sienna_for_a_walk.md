She welcomed her first child with husband Hugo Taylor four months ago.

And Millie Mackintosh and Hugo Taylor were every inch the doting parents as they look their little girl - Sienna - out for a walk in west London on Tuesday.

The former Made In Chelsea star, 31, opted for a stylish casual look as she stepped out wearing an oversized khaki jacket with a pair of leopard print gym leggings.

She tied the outfit together with a black T-shirt and a pair of black and white Nike trainers, carrying her belongings in a grey suede bag.

Millie appeared to go make-up free and wore her honey locks loose, while also sporting a pair of oversized cat-eye sunglasses.

Meanwhile, Hugo, 34, also looked dressed down in a pair of navy tracksuit bottoms and a khaki hooded jacket, while accessorising with a blue beanie.

The father-of-one could be seen leaning over Sienna's pram to check on his baby daughter during their walk.

Last week, Millie decided to ditch her nursing bras in favour of something racier, as she shared a glimpse of her new lingerie set, after revealing she had given up breastfeeding because her daughter Sienna was struggling with Silent Reflux.

The reality personality shared a snap of the sheer lace two-piece after telling fans she has to feed her baby girl with a special formula to combat her reflux. 

Millie told fans she'd been sent the sexy lingerie, but had been unable to wear the snap due to her breastfeeding.

But the star was now ready to don the revealing two-piece, writing: 'As my breast feeding journey has come to an end I decided it was time to treat myself to some new underwear! @agentprovocateur *gift.' 

On Tuesday, Millie told fans that she was no longer able to nurse her daughter Sienna as she has Silent Reflux, a condition that causes children to bring up milk, or be sick, shortly after breastfeeding.

She took to Instagram to give an update on her little one, and said she has to stop breastfeeding and start giving her a specific formula.

Detailing her concern for Sienna, Millie explained in a lengthy caption alongside a photo of the two of them: 'A big development for Sienna (and for me) a few weeks ago was the realisation and confirmation that she has Silent Reflux. 

'She'd been displaying quite a few symptoms - distracted short breast feeds, crying every night, arching her back, going stiff, coughing and always trying to stand up.

'All of these symptoms were made worse when she started wearing her hip harness as she couldn't stretch out her legs which is what many babies do in response to reflux.

'We had assumed it was the harness itself causing her distress but it wasn't until I read @magic_sleep_fairy book that it all made sense.

'I felt so bad for not realising before as she seemed so happy in the day. I was reassured a lot of her symptoms were just 'normal' baby behaviour but I knew deep down that something wasn't right. 

'My mummy instinct was right and confirmed at an appointment with a Paediatric Gastroenterologist.'

Millie went on to talk about what she is doing to help Sienna, as she added: 'Sienna is now on medication and based on the professional advice given, it has meant my breastfeeding journey has come to an end much sooner than I had hoped.

'It was a really emotional decision to step back and transition to the suggested specific formula that helps with this condition.

'I reminded myself that firstly it's all about whatever is best for Sienna and secondly I am so grateful for the 4 months of beautiful bonding we shared during our feeding times (it's not a given for everyone)

Not yet! Millie told fans she'd been sent the sexy lingerie, but had been unable to wear the snap due to her breastfeeding

'I was at peace with whatever need to be done in order to make Sienna comfortable.' 

Millie hit out at trolls, as she begged 'mum police' not to judge her: ' I'm in no way suggesting anyone stops breast feeding just because their baby has reflux...

'my reflux / breast feeding journey with Sienna was exacerbated by her wearing a hip harness.

'Breast feeding became even more difficult (impossible to ever get her in a comfy position) and I did try to combi feed for a while but I found it all too much.

Motherhood: On Tuesday, Millie told fans that she was no longer able to nurse her daughter Sienna as she has Silent Reflux, a condition that causes children to bring up milk, or be sick, shortly after breastfeeding

'It's been a tough few months, needless to say anxiety levels went sky-high and I'm still struggling with the emotional rollercoaster of being a new mum - the guilt, the worry, the panic and the other hundred things that I try not to overwhelm myself with!' 

Millie gave birth to Sienna in May during the coronavirus pandemic and national lockdown, something which she said was 'daunting'.

However although hating the idea of not being able to have her husband with her during the delivery, Millie said that her main concern was Sienna's wellbeing.

She added that her 'primal instincts' kicked in and that Hugo did get to be with her for a few hours at the hospital after their daughter was born. 

Revealing: Millie told fans she'd been sent a sheer cream two-piece by a lingerie brand, and was finally ready to wear it after ditching her nursing bras
