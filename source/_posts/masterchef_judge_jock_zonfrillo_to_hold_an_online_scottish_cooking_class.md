Masterchef Judge Jock Zonfrillo is currently in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown in Victoria. 

So, to keep both himself and his fans entertained during the trying time the 44-year-old is hosting an online Scottish cooking class on Saturday via his social media channels. 

The Glasgow born chef will be making an iconic Scottish breakfast of rolls with a square sausage.

'During the Cook-Up I'll prep and cook both recipes from start to finish,' he wrote on Facebook. 

'You should be set for a cracking Sunday breakfast or if you are anything like me a late night snack! Don't forget the Heinz Ketchup and HP sauce!'

In an earlier post he explained that the delicacy is 'one of the first things' he eats when he returns to Scotland.

'If you're Scottish living away from home you know exactly what I mean,' he wrote. 

'Most people outside of Scotland have no clue what it is meanwhile us Scots count down the days, hours, minutes and seconds till we're reunited with it once again.' 

For those that wish to cook along, the lesson is scheduled to take place at 4pm Sydney and Melbourne time.

Since appearing on the Channel Ten cooking show, Jock has made quiet the impression on MasterChef Australia fans, with viewers going wild over his rugged good looks. 

However, the chef told The Daily Telegraph earlier this year that he's a little 'embarrassed' about it all.

'I find it embarrassing. It's very flattering... but I'm Captain Awkward,' he said.
