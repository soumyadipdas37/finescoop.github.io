An amateur home cook has shared how she cooked salmon fillets to perfection using her 3.2 litre Kmart air fryer.

While she was sceptical at first, Diane seasoned the fresh fish before placing into the air fryer at 180 degrees Celsius and to her surprise it only took nine minutes to cook  perfectly. 

'Was a sceptic about how well the air fryer would cook salmon. It was perfect,' she wrote online alongside snaps of her tasty dinner. 

An amateur home cook has shared how she cooked salmon fillets to perfection using her 3.2 litre Kmart air fryer 

While she was sceptical at first, Diane seasoned the fresh fish before placing into the air fryer at 180 degrees Celsius 

To season the fish, she rubbed the salmon with lime-infused olive oil, parsley, thyme and dill, which made the food taste 'so delicious'.

Diane originally found a simple recipe in a cookbook but opted to use the handy air fryer rather than the oven. 

On Facebook other home cooks agreed and said the air fryer is the best gadget for cooking fish and other types of meat. 

'Was a sceptic about how well the air fryer would cook salmon. It was perfect,' she said online and shared images to a popular Australian Facebook group 

'It cooks salmon to perfection. Yours look delicious,' one person said.

'Salmon is the absolute best in the air fryer,' another added.

'Am doing pork tonight, did barramundi last night. So moist,' a third said.

The online post was 'liked' more than 230 times and 111 others commented by tagging friends to share the recipe further. 

Earlier in September, another home cook revealed how she made prawn toast  (pictured) in her $89 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer after a similar recipe was shared on MasterChef Australia

Earlier in September, another home cook revealed how she made prawn toast in her $89 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer after a similar recipe was shared on MasterChef Australia. 

Lynette, from Melbourne, posted the recipe to a popular cookery group where others raved about how delicious it was. 

'Recipe is a modified version from Sarah Tiong Masterchef Au 2020, recipe makes 12 slices,' she said online.

Prawn toast is a Chinese dish made from bread brushed with egg or oil and coated with minced prawn. 

To make the toast, she used bread slices, prawns, sesame oil, fresh ginger, sesame seeds, garlic and salt and pepper to season.

The recipe itself is simple to follow and only takes less than 15 minutes to complete from start to finish.
