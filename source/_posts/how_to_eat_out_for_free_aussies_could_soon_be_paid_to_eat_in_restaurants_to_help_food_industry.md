Australians could soon be paid to eat in restaurants for free as struggling businesses  try to bounce back from COVID-19. 

Every household in Victoria could receive a $100 meal voucher for a restaurant or pub of their choice under the new proposals.  

Restaurant and Catering Australia is pushing Dan Andrews' government to bail out the struggling industry with the $650million plan. 

Similar schemes have been rolled out in the UK, where 40 million meals were offered at half price, and Tasmania, on Monday. 

Melbourne has been under Stage Four lockdown since August 2, the state's second round of restrictions since March. 

Residents are under an 8pm to 5am curfew, can only travel 5km for shopping or exercise and restaurants and cafe's are takeaway only.

Wes Lambert, CEO, of Restaurant and Catering Australia told radio station 3AW it is the fastest way to get businesses back on their feet.  

'It's time for Dan to pay for his plan,' he told listeners.

'Until we get bums back on seats in Victoria, into restaurants, there will be no recovery.' 

Mr Lambert has suggested a meal voucher of up to $100 be distributed to every Victorian household after the curfew is lifted. 

The Tasmanian government launched 'Make Yourself At Home' on Monday which saw $7.5million dollars worth of vouchers snapped up in 40 minutes. 

The $100 accommodation and $50 experience vouchers are designed to encourage people to travel and eat out again.

Diners in the UK were offered half-price meals from Monday to Wednesday in August as part of 'Eat out to help out'. 

'Nearly 40 million meals were subsided by the UK government to bring the restaurant industry in the UK out of the brink,' he told listeners.   

He said it can be hard for state and federal governments to implement a new scheme quickly - so the industry would follow either Tasmania or the UK if necessary.  

'This is the fastest and best way to help the hospitality industry get back on its feet and to get consumers back and dining,' Mr Lambert said.
