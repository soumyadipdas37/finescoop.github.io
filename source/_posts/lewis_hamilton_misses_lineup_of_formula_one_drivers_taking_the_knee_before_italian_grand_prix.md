Lewis Hamilton was mysteriously missing from the line-up of Formula One drivers taking the knee before the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. 

Mercedes driver Hamilton, as well as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, were late to the anti-racism message before the start of the race. Sportsmail have contacted Mercedes for comment. 

As has become customary before the start of a race this season, drivers have stood united in opposition to racism. But at Monza on Sunday, Hamilton was nowhere to be seen in his usual position at the front of the pack as he was running late.
