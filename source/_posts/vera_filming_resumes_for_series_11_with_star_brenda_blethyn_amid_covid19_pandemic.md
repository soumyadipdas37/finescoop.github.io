Vera has resumed filming after the COVID-19 pandemic, with the crew donning face masks and shields to record scenes in Tynemouth on Monday.

Star Brenda Blethyn, 74, was spotted among the ITV drama's cast in the midst of another tense scene as the titular detective prepares to solve another case.

In March, production on the 11th series of Vera was suspended as the COVID-19 pandemic began to grip the nation, with star Brenda admitting they were just weeks away from the start of filming.

Brenda was in high spirits as she donned her character's signature hat to film the outdoor scenes.

The crew all donned protective masks or face shields, as they set up lighting before the cameras began to roll.

ITV have already confirmed that Vera will eventually return with its 11th series in 2021, with the first two episodes to air early next year after being filmed under strict COVID-19 guidelines.

'The safety of all personnel is always at the forefront of production, and with all the extra Covid precautions in place, we will relish creating and delivering six cracking new episodes.'

In March Brenda revealed that she and the cast were just weeks away from the start of filming for Vera's new series, but were forced to put plans on hold due to the COVID-19 crisis.

She said on This Morning: 'We were due to start in a couple of weeks actually. It's all cast, episode one has been written and more commissioned and we're all ready to go. We're just waiting for the all clear.'

Vera will return to ITV in 2021.
