The Woolworths Ooshies craze reappeared in supermarkets across Australia on August 26 - and now customers are attempting to sell the miniature collectable Disney Plus toys on eBay for thousands of dollars.

One shopper from New South Wales set an immense price tag of $50,000 for their 'rare' glitter Elsa from Frozen figurine, even though this toy is quite common.

Another shopper from Queensland also priced their glitter Star Wars The Mandalorian Ooshies for a starting bid of $9,000, while another from the ACT has set the cost to $10,000 for their glitter Woody from Toy Story.

There are currently no online bids for each sparkly Ooshies toy.

But in some occasional cases, few customers have been eager to pay the excessive amounts of cash in order to complete their collection.

Last week two rare Simba Ooshies from the previous Lion King collection were sold for a sum of $15,000.

The complete Lion King set is also currently selling on eBay between $5,000 and $7,000.

In other instances, some eBay sellers are willing to help customers complete the new Disney Plus Ooshies collection and are selling specific individual Ooshies for $3.99 each.

The collection features 36 Ooshies, which follows the success of last year's wildly popular Lion King Ooshies

The plastic Ooshies are available to collect at all Woolworths stores if a purchase of $30 or more is made.

The collection features 36 Ooshies, which follows the success of last year's wildly popular Lion King Ooshies.

Other variations in addition to the glitter toys include glow in the dark, silver, gold, hologram, colour change and original. 

Woolworths has also teamed up with TerraCycle to offer customers a sustainable way to recycle their previous Ooshies.
