She is the Love Island 2019 star who has an eye for style.

And Francesca Allen looked incredible as she stepped out for dinner in London on Thursday.

The reality star, 24, displayed her toned abs in a white crop-top paired with taupe baggy trousers.

The beauty added a jaunty twist to her outfit with a navy blue beret and accessorised with shimmering gold chains.

Opting for comfort she donned white trainers for her night on the tiles.

Her brunette tresses were styled in soft waves while a radiant palette of make-up enhanced her pretty features. 

Over the summer months Francesca enjoyed several holidays and her Instagram was littered with sizzling bikini snaps.

 Aside from her frequent getaways, Francesca was spotted cosying up to a new man during a boozy night out in London earlier this summer.

She looked to be on cloud nine as she got up close and personal with Edward Crossan, vice chairman of London-based waste management company Powerday.

The TV personality, who is family friends with Edward, put on a very affectionate display with the hunk who was previously been linked to TOWIE's Amber Turner.

 In May last year, Edward was seen enjoying a jaunt on a yacht in Ibiza with TOWIE star Amber, 27, who is currently dating Dan Edgar.

The accomplished businessman was named vice chairman of his father's company in January and is featured on the company's website.

His working title is described on the website as: 'Edward joined the family business in 2007, starting as a machine driver and has worked in various roles within the company to now being a director overseeing the development of the business.'

MailOnline contacted Francesca's representatives for further comment at the time of publication.
