She recently returned to Smooth Radio so her husband Derek Draper can listen to her voice in intensive care amid his coronavirus battle. 

And Kate Garraway cut a casual figure in a blue denim balloon-sleeve blouse teamed with white skinny jeans as she left Global Studios in central London on Tuesday. 

The Good Morning Britain presenter, 53, put safety first with a blue face mask and carried a takeaway coffee cup for a post-work refreshment following her radio slot.

Kate toted an oversized ochre leather handbag for her everyday essentials and two shopping bags as she strutted along the pavement.  

She wore her blonde tresses in a chic bob and looked radiant in a natural covering of makeup. 

Finishing her laid-back look, Kate added teal hoop earrings and metallic silver trainers with a white sole.

Kate took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek, 53, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19.

But last week she announced she would be returning to her Smooth Radio show so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'

She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break.   

Derek was hospitalised back in March after suffering complications from contracting COVID-19, and has remained there since.   

Last Thursday the TV star revealed how she celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Derek after being unable to visit him in hospital.

Speaking on last Friday's Good Morning Britain, she revealed she was able see him later in the day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a limited consciousness state.  

Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.

'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again.

'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.'    

Derek is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. 

Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.

She shares Darcey, 14, and William, 11, with Derek.
