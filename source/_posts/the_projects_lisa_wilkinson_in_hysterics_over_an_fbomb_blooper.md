Lisa Wilkinson struggled to regain her composure after an F-bomb blooper on Sunday's episode of The Project.

The 60-year-old slumped over the desk and was in fits of laughter, after a sports segment saw a passionate mother mouthing "f**k off!" from the sidelines.

'I believe she said it was a "fair call",' Lisa's co-host Tommy Little quipped.

Tommy, 35, introduced the segment that saw mother Kim Stojanov proudly watching her son Cody Ramsey's NRL debut.

While a pre-game interview saw Kim understandably getting emotional, her demeanour changed when in the sidelines and critiquing a referee's decision.

Channel Ten muted her blunt remarks, but on screen it was quite clear the words she had mouthed off in fury.

Lisa, who did not see the F-bomb coming, laughed uncontrollably while slumped over the desk.

This isn't the first time Lisa hasn't been able to hide her shock while hosting the current affairs program.

Last month, the former Today show star gasped in horror over a comment made by co-host Tommy.

Condition: Last month, singer Thelma Plum (pictured) revealed how she developed 'dysosmia' - where everything tastes like 'garbage' - when recovering from COVID-19 earlier this year 

Singer Thelma Plum appeared on the show where she discussed having developed 'dysosmia' - a disordered sense of smell and taste - after recovering from COVID-19 earlier this year.

After Thelma, 25, revealed that everything tastes like 'garbage', Tommy quipped that he had a similar condition growing up with his mother's cooking.

Lisa gasped and then remarked: 'You can't say that!'   

Tommy responded in a joking manner: 'I had a similar condition that was called "growing up with my mum's cooking"'
