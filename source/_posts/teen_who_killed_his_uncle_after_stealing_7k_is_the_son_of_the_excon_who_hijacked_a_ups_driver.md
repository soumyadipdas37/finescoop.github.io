The teen boy who confessed to fatally shooting his uncle is the son of the 41-year-old ex-convict, Lamar Alexander, shot dead last year after hijacking a UPS driver. 

Charles Alexander, 15, has been charged with second-degree murder and armed grand theft in the killing of 46-year-old beloved Miami high school football coach, Corey Smith, last Monday.

But Charles, who is said to have a history of mental illness, has been declared unfit to stand trail four times in the past and now his attorney has suggested the criminal justice system may have failed child in need of help due to past trauma. 

Corey Smith and Lamar Alexander were technically cousins, but they were so close growing up that they were seen as brothers. Alexander's son, Charles, was thus considered Smith's nephew.

Last year Lamar Alexander and another ex-con Ronnie Jerome Hill, 41, took hostage UPS driver Frank Ordonez, 27. Ordonez and another motorist who happened to be in the area, Richard Cutshaw, 70, were killed, as well as the two suspects.

The entire incident was caught on television and Smith said of Lamar Alexander the day after the hostage shootout: 'In life, you gotta make better decisions. We weren't raised like that. I love my brother, but he's been making bad decisions his whole life.'

Nearly 10 months later, teen Charles Alexander was staying at Smith's home in West Little River when he robbed him of $7,450 in cash then used his relative's 9mm Beretta handgun to shot him dead in the den, according to police.  

'He asked to come over,' Corey's wife, Amina Smith, said. 'We hadn't seen him since his dad passed. Corey picked him up Sunday night and he spent the night.

'I left to go to work.'

Police were called to Smith's home after at least three gunshots were heard by neighbors. 

Surveillance footage showed that Alexander was the only person at home at the time of the shooting, it is alleged. 

Investigators also found more than $7,000 in cash belonging to the coach inside a pair of jeans hidden in Alexander's black bag, police said.

When investigators interviewed the teen, he told them he was studying at the time of the shooting. After being interviewed for several hours by Miami-Dade Police Department, Alexander was allowed to go home.

Two days later, Alexander's mother called the police and asked to speak to them.

According to investigators, she was 'in fear of the defendant' and said that her son 'confessed to her that he had killed his uncle.'

Police responded to the scene on Monday after gunshots were heard coming from Smith's home in West Little River but Charles claimed he was studying at the time of the shooting

According to investigators, Alexander shot Smith with the coach's own 9MM Beretta gun (like the one seen in the above file photo)

The police arrest report indicated that the murder weapon was found in a trash can outside their home.

Charles Alexander has had a difficult recent past that includes run-ins with the law.

In May 2018, he was arrested for allegedly making a bomb threat at a middle school in Allapattah.

Investigators said school administrators received 'numerous phone calls' stating that a bomb would be detonated unless the school was evacuated.

The phone calls were traced to a phone on campus. Charles Alexander and two others were arrested.

But his case, which was brought before juvenile court, stalled due to mental health problems.

Alexander was four times declared incompetent to stand trial.

'There are many juveniles who also suffer from early childhood trauma, learning deficiencies, and mental illness and the criminal justice system, can no longer afford to allow them to fall through the cracks,' Alexander's attorney, Rod Vereen, told the Herald.

'If the allegations are proven true, that my client committed this unfortunate crime, then here's a prime example of the system failing this child.

'Should he have been involuntary committed over the past couple of years, so he would not have been a danger to the community?

'Coach Smith would still be alive today, right?

'If the facts are true, who failed whom?' 

During a hearing in Miami-Dade juvenile court on Thursday, a judge ordered Alexander be held in secure detention.

Prosecutors in Miami-Dade County plan to charge him as an adult, the Miami Herald reported. 

Lamar Alexander and Hill, two ex-cons, were armed when they tried to rob a jewelry store.
