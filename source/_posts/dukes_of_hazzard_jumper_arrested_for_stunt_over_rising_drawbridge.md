A Michigan daredevil has been arrested for driving his Dodge sedan over a rising drawbridge 'Dukes of Hazzard' style, while allegedly being high on 'whippets'. 

Miguel Gomez, 26, reportedly carried out the dangerous stunt over the Fort Street bridge in Detroit. 

He 'struck and drove through' Fort Street Bridge's security gate at speed and was launched into the air before landing on the other side of the bridge, Wayne County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.

During the stunt he reportedly damaged the security gate as well as his car's tires and windshield. 

A police dispatcher compared the incident to a scene from the 'Dukes of Hazzard', a 1970s television show in which a Dodge Charger would often take flying leaps to escape from law enforcement, according to a report in local station WDIV-TV.

Drawbridge operator Andre Locke, who witnessed the incident, was quoted by the news outlet as saying: 'And I looked, I said, 'No he ain't.''

'Over he went, blew out all four of his tires, and then he crashed into the other gate,' Locke said. 

He added: 'It was a first for me.'  

Gomez faces charges including malicious destruction of property and reckless driving. 

Police said the driver is also suspected of being under the influence from using a source of nitrous oxide known as 'whippits.'

He was arraigned on Saturday and released on a $3,500 bond. 

If convicted, the 26-year-old faces up to five years behind bars. 

'These pandemic times have seemingly brought out the worst in many Michigan drivers,' Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said, as quoted by The Detroit News. 

'The rules of the road the same and there is no place for drivers who refuse to follow them and instead try alleged stunts like this.'
