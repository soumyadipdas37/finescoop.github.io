Chelsea defender Thiago Silva has insisted he is not in London to take in the sights after an error on his debut cost Chelsea in their 3-3 draw with West Bromwich Albion.

The Brazilian star's uncharacteristic mistake allowed Callum Robinson to race through and make it 2-0 to the Baggies - before Chelsea fought back to draw 3-3 - but Thiago has said he remains as committed to seeking glory as ever at the age of 36.

During his illustrious career Silva has won a plethora of silverware including titles in Italy and France, and despite his a bulging trophy cabinet he is still hungry for more.

Robinson couldn't believe his luck after Silva's error, and Chelsea dropped precious points

Ahead of the Carabao Cup clash against old rivals Tottenham, Silva told Chelsea's official matchday programme: 'I'm not here just to go through the motions, or just for the experience, I'm here to win. 

'I want everyone to be very clear about that: I'm going to give my all to make sure that Chelsea win.

'I didn't come here to dine out in London or visit the tourist sites. I came to play football, to work, and that's what I'm preparing for.

'I'm certain, with the group of players we've got and a coach who's a natural leader, that we'll be in the fight for every piece of silverware going this year.'

Silva signed a one-year deal with Chelsea after leaving Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer, after the French giants lost to Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League final. 

Silva was made captain at West Brom but his Chelsea career got off to a poor start

The Brazil star is at ease with the length of his deal and hinted he could well extend his stay in west London: 'I'm totally relaxed about the contract and whether Chelsea will want to renew it or not, I don't know.

'If I haven't met expectations or contributed then we'll sit down and talk about that. But I'm not worried at all.

'I will do my best possible and really contribute to this team, this new project. I've accepted this new challenge, it's going to be really good for me.

'Everyone knows that my ambition is to play in the World Cup in two years' time when I'll be 38. That's a great responsibility.'
