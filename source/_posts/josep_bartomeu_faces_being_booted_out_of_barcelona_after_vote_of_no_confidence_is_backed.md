Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu may soon find himself being forced out of the club with a vote of no confidence now looming over him.

The explosive motion of censure has now reached the amount of signatures from members needed to trigger the process, after the Mes que una Mocio platform was launched two weeks ago in a bid to bring about the vote.

The signatures will first need to be verified within 10 days, and then a poll will be held between the 150,000 members. At least 66 per cent of the votes will need to be cast against Bartomeu to ensure the under-fire chief's reign is brought to an end.

Mass protests from fans have led to club members raising enough signatures for the vote

Those wanting to vote have had to be present in Catalonia, or at one of the few overseas locations where the documents can be officially signed. In excess of 16,520 votes in favour from disgruntled members were needed.

AS have claimed, however, that there were no doubts that the movement would reach the required amount despite the difficulties.

Three rival candidates, Jordi Farre, Victor Font and Lluis Fernandez Ala - all of whom are competing to replace Bartomeu - have joined the vote alongside eight Barcelona opinion groups.

Over 16,250 signatures against Bartomeu were needed and that number has been surpassed

The signatures will be delivered to the club by 6pm on Thursday, with members currently scrambling to gain a healthy margin in the event some votes are not valid.         

Bartomeu has come under increasing demands to step away from his role after his poor handling of the Lionel Messi transfer saga. 

Barcelona recently endured a campaign without silverware and their humiliating Champions League exit saw their talisman submit an official transfer request.

The board were unwilling to let him leave, however, and their steadfast approach eventually forced Messi to stay against his wishes.

The president's reign was due to end next year regardless, with elections currently scheduled for March. But the horror campaign, combined with the poor running of the club, has sparked the process designed to kick him out early. 

Bartomeu took the role in 2014, after Sandro Rossell's resignation, and would be able to nominate a 'continuity' candidate should the elections go ahead as planned.
