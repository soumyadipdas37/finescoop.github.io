They've been busy shooting scenes now the show is back for its 10th anniversary.

And Amber Turner, 27, looked sensational as she put on a busty display while sunbathing with her co-stars in Brentwood, Essex, on Wednesday. 

The TOWIE star was joined by fellow cast members Courtney Green, 25, and Chloe Meadows, 27, for filming, with the beauties all opting for bikini tops to make the most of topping up their tans.

She accessorised her two-piece with a pair of oversized aviator sunglasses and a selection of stylish rings.

Meanwhile Courtney also ensured she was dressed up for the filming, wearing a pair of eye-catching orange and cream trousers.

The 10th anniversary series was due to start filming in March 2020, but ITV bosses made the tough decision to put the production on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.  

Fans were left without their Essex fix until the show came back with a vengeance on Sunday night, with former cast member Amy Childs returning.

There will also be surprise appearances from some of the show's other big stars from the past decade.

Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels and Acquisitions for ITV, added: 'After 10 years, TOWIE is still going strong and remains the number one show on ITVBe.

'We're thrilled to be welcoming back new and old faces for the upcoming mega-series as the show celebrates this special anniversary.'
