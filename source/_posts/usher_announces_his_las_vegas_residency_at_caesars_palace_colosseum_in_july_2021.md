The 41-year-old triple threat will put his incredible dancing and singing skills on display for what is sure to be a spectacle that many fans will flock to. 

'I have missed performing for my fans live and I am so excited to see them in Las Vegas,' Usher said in a statement on Caesars website. 

 'My residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace will be full of surprises and an Usher experience like they've never seen or heard before' he concluded. 

This is the first Las Vegas residency to be announced since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Though the future of live entertainment is uncertain, Caesars Palace and Sin City are holding out hope that things will be able to return to normal by next summer.  

In addition to this exciting new career venture Usher is also expecting his third child with his new partner, Jenn Goicoechea.

Speaking to Us Weekly a close source of the pair reported that 'They are thrilled and very excited.' 

The pair were first linked last Fall after they were seen canoodling at the Hollywood Bowl before attending Sean 'P Diddy' Combs 50th birthday party back in December. 

Raymond has two children Naviyd Ely, 11 and Usher V, 12 with his ex-wife Tameka Foster to whom he was married for two years before splitting in 2009.

Since quarantine Usher has been spending a lot of time with his boys and girlfriend as they prepare to expand their family by one. 

Back in May the star took part in Verizon's Pay it Forward Live series to support small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
