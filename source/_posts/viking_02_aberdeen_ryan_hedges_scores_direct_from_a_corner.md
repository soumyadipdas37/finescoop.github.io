Aberdeen are progressing in the Europa League, earning a win over Norwegian opponents Viking in the second qualifying round. 

The visitors got the lead just before half-time, as Ross McCrorie drilled the ball into the back of the net low after a corner. 

There was a long pause after the goal as the officials debated whether two players in offside positions interfered with play, but the goal was given.
