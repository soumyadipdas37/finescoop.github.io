She plays the ultimate blonde bombshell on the popular US reality series, Selling Sunset. 

And Christine Quinn was more than happy to live up to the reputation while posing for Maxim Australia's October cover story.

The 31-year-old reality star shows off her sensational curves and very ample cleavage in a PVC high-cut one piece in the spread.

Christine has made no secret of the fact that she has had cosmetic surgery, and is passionate that people should be honest about any procedures they've undergone.

The blonde bombshell told Vogue recently: 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia.  

'People think that [things are] real, and it's not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up.

'How I look on Selling Sunset is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.

'The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two-and-a-half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either – $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap.'
