Samantha Cameron has admitted she 'didn't expect' her husband David would be 'overly involved' with their newborn daughter Florence when he was Prime Minister. 

The businesswoman, 49, has spoken of life in Downing Street, after giving birth to daughter Florence, now ten, shortly before David, 53, first took office in 2010 - revealing her husband has always been a 'brilliant dad'. 

Appearing on ITV's Lorraine today, Samantha told that David would 'always' give his children Florence, Nancy, now 16, and Arthur, now 14, evening bath when they were 'tiny'. 

When asked if she had any advice for Carrie Symonds, the wife of Boris Johnson who in April gave birth to her first baby boy, the mother-of-four confessed that raising her newborn 'seemed fairly seamless'.

Appearing on ITV's Lorraine today, Samantha spoke of life in Downing Street after giving birth to daughter Florence shortly before David, 53, first took office in 2010

'I think I was on my fourth by then, so I think it seemed fairly seamless. I have to say, I wasn't expecting him [David] to get overly involved', she told. 

'He's always been a brilliant Dad, so I think one of the things we always did with the children when they were really tiny is he would have a bath with them and that was quite bonding. 

'It was also much easier than for me to bath in one of those tiny plastic things where you're always terrified you're going to drop them and they're going to slip out of your hands, so he always did that when he could and we sort of muddled through somehow.' 

She went on to reveal that to bring a sense of normality to their four-bedroom flat above No 11, the family brought all of their previous home's furniture with them, and would often throw their children birthday parties and hold playdates for their kids.

'It was easier when they were littler because they didn't really understand what was going on', said Samantha. 

'When we moved into Downing Street, I carried on going to work and dropping them off at school and they carried on at their same schools and they had their friends round for parties and play dates. 

'But as they grew a bit older and became teenagers, I think the pressure of having a father as Prime Minister and living somewhere like Downing Street, I think it does become a little stranger.'

She went on to explain that while she wanted to 'support her husband', the creative director wanted to 'carry on with her life', and didn't want to be 'overly involved' with her husband's role.

'It is very different', said Samantha, 'I took the view that I wanted to carry on with my life, you know, support my husband in the best way I could, but also continue my life and the children's life as normal. 

'I continued with my job and I went down to working from full time to three days a week, so I could support him when he needed me, but not getting overly involved. 

'There's not an official role and people take different routes, but that's how I decided to handle it. I had three small children and a new baby .'

Speaking of the dress, she went on: 'You're always looking for something for those occasions and not to blend too much into Downing Street door, so it was always good to get print and colour on your outfit.' 

She admitted that while she would often try to make her outfits look polished and 'effortless', she would often spent lots of time prepping, but confessed she would still occasionally forget shoes or the right underwear. 

Samantha added: 'On the outfit thing, the camera doesn't lie and it's much harder finding things to wear that are appropriate. 

'I'd be lying if I said I didn't spend quite a lot of time prepping and trying to make it look effortless. 

'There were moments where I would forget my underwear or shoes and would have to borrow underwear, we tried to make it look effortless but it clearly wasn't really.'
