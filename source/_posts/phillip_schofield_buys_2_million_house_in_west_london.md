TV presenter Phil Schofield has splashed out on a £2 million bachelor pad in west London as he works out his 'amicable' £9 million divorce with his wife, MailOnline can reveal.

This Morning star Schofield, 58, was seen leaving the large semi-detached property in Chiswick today with co-presenter and close friend Holly Willoughby.

The pair emerged from the house on their bicycles to set off for a leisurely ride in bright afternoon sunshine. 

The house, just a stone's throw from The Thames, is close to his ITV colleague Declan Donnelly’s home and Ant McPartlin's former home he shared with Lisa Armstrong.

Schofield settled into his new house after it emerged that he is also building himself an annex at the family home in Oxfordshire. 

Donning a cycling helmet today, the presenter was dressed in a tee-shirt and cycling shorts with his co-host in a grey tee shirt and black leggings. 

Neighbours told MailOnline that they had regularly seen the presenter around the area since moving in around two weeks ago. 

He has also been frequenting pubs along the River Thames, which just lies a short distance from his new home.

Locals said that Schofield is seen more on foot or bike than in his luxury Jaguar sports car which has a private number plate and is parked on the forecourt of his new home.

One neighbour said: ‘It’s caused quite a stir since he’s moved in and got people very excited. He seems like a very nice man and quite normal. You see him walking or cycling mainly and he smiles every time he goes past.’

Another neighbour added: ‘There’s quite a few famous people already living around here so Phillip Schofield moving in is not a big deal. A lot of people have been talking about it, but nobody bothers him. He’s a lovely bloke and I’m sure he’ll enjoy living in our community.

The news of the move follows a tumultuous few months for one of Britain’s most popular TV faces, following his tearful on-air ‘coming out’ on live television in February.

He is said to be keen to keep his divorce from wife of 27 years Steph as amicable as possible and maintain a good relationship with his daughters.

The new house on a wide residential road boasts a magnificent open-plan kitchen, three receptions, six bedrooms and a converted basement.

MailOnline understands he bought from a family who were moving to New Zealand and put the property on the market about a year ago for £2 million.

His TV pals will be close at hand, with Willoughby living just across the river in Barnes and Dec down the road.

This week, Schofield’s net worth was revealed to have topped £9m, increasing by £800,000 in the last year alone, thanks in part to a £60,000 deal making him the face of a gin advent calendar and his new tell-all autobiography, Life’s What You Make It comes out next month.

As co-director of his company, Steph is likely to be entitled to half of everything, but the couple are determined to remain friends.

A source told The Sun: ‘Phillip and Steph have had a lot of hard, painful conversations over the past ten months but remain as tight and devoted to one another as ever. 

‘Steph is entitled to half. He is not disputing this — all he wants in return is her ongoing loyalty . . . and discretion, his family is his number one priority and that will never change.’

Phillip also co-owns a plush country pile located in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, which has been the family home for many years with Steph and his two grown-up daughters, Ruby and Mollie.

The house - worth at least £2.5 million - is surrounded by lush greenery and one recent report suggested he was planning to build a bachelor bolt-hole by converting a two-bedroom house on the grounds and knocking down one of the garages.

But the move to London suggests he’s making more of a clean break from the former family home, which looks likely to remain Steph’s home following the divorce..

The TV star also owns an incredible holiday home in Portugal.

It is located in the Algarve and offers stunning views across the Portuguese hills.

Naturally, the villa has a private swimming pool and perfectly manicured lawns, as well as a number of al-fresco eating spots.

In September it was revealed that Phil more than doubled his salary in a year, from £803,000 to £1.73million.

The £927,000 rise for the ITV host was revealed in newly published accounts and was largely due to Dancing On Ice’s return in January last year.

In February, Phillip — who made his name with Gordon the Gopher on BBC’s Broom Cupboard — stunned viewers in an emotional interview with Willoughby in which he revealed he was gay.

He said he had wrestled with the decision, adding: ‘You never know what’s going on in someone’s seemingly perfect life.

‘So you won’t know what has been consuming me for the last few years.’

Schofield's agent was contacted for comment.
