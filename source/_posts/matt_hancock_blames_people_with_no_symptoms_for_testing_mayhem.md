Matt Hancock today claimed the test and trace fiasco was caused by people without coronavirus symptoms getting tested inappropriately. 

Defending the government's service amid growing criticism, the Health Secretary claimed people with no symptoms applying for tests was putting the system under strain.

He also hinted that Covid tests could be rationed unless people who are fit and healthy stop draining capacity, adding, 'We've got to be firmer, I'm afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing.'

Mr Hancock said it was 'not acceptable' for people to ask for a test if they have no symptoms.  

In other coronavirus developments today: 

He rejected claims that the testing system was failing, telling Sky News that testing capacity was at its highest ever level.

But he said that in the last couple of weeks there had been an increase in demand among people not eligible for tests.

He said this morning: 'We have had stories of schools sending a whole year group to go and get a test and that is not appropriate, what is appropriate is that if you have symptoms then get a test.'

Mr Hancock also refused to rule out a second national lockdown, telling Sky News: 'Our goal is to avoid having to do anything more drastic - I won't make a vow like that. 

'I'm a Health Secretary in the middle of a pandemic.' 

He defended the test and trace system as 'excellent' despite growing criticism, and said problems have been caused by people without symptoms requesting tests.

Questioned over whether the system was failing, he told Sky News: 'I completely reject the accusation, in fact quite the contrary.'

He said the UK has the biggest system per capita in Europe and the highest testing capacity 'we've ever had'.

'However in the last couple of weeks we've seen an increase in demand, including an increase in demand from people who are not eligible for tests, people who don't have symptoms,' he added.

'We've seen an increase of about 25% of people who are coming forward that don't have symptoms and aren't eligible.'

The Health Secretary told the public not to get coronavirus tests unless they have symptoms in order to stop people having to travel long distances to get tested.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'We have seen this quite sharp rise in the last couple of weeks of people without symptoms who don't have a good reason coming forward to get a test.

'There have been stories of whole schools, or parts of schools, being all sent to get a test - that is not acceptable, that is not an appropriate use of our testing resources.

'I've even heard stories of people saying, 'I'm going on holiday next week therefore I'm going to get a test.' No - that is not what the testing system is there for.

'We've got to be firmer, I'm afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing.'

NHS testing boss issues 'heartfelt apology' to people unable to get Covid tests and blames lack of capacity at laboratories for backlog

NHS Test and Trace director of testing Sarah-Jane Marsh (pictured) has issued an apology 

A senior official at NHS Test and Trace last night issued an apology to people unable to get a Covid-19 test as officials consider new lockdown restrictions to curb the current spike in cases.

Director of testing Sarah-Jane Marsh said there is capacity at testing sites but laboratories processing the tests are at a 'critical pinch-point'.

Ms Marsh added that the system is doing 'all it can to expand quickly'.

There have been reports of people being told there are no appointments available at test centres in England and that there are no home tests kits available to send out.

Ms Marsh wrote on Twitter: 'Can I please offer my heartfelt apologies to anyone who cannot get a Covid test at present.

'All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded; it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point. We are doing all we can to expand quickly.

'We have additional NHS, Lighthouse, University and Partner Labs all due to open up imminently and we are also expanding the use of non-Laboratory based tests.The testing team work on this 18 hours a day, seven days a week. We recognise the country is depending on us.' 

Andy Thompson, 38, a technical manager from Crewe, said his six-year-old daughter is home from school with a continuous cough, but has so far been unable to get a home test.

'It's an absolute shambles. No home tests available. And now the nearest test centre is Oldham, a 100-mile round-trip with a sick child,' he said.

'I didn't realise how bad it is. If you haven't got a car, no way you're getting tested.'

People have also complained in recent days and weeks of being directed hundreds of miles to get a test.

On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged that people would have to travel no more than 75 miles for a test.

Further problems with the testing system came as a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the latest increase in coronavirus cases is 'very worrying'.

Professor Andrew Hayward said scientists are monitoring the data closely for signs of wider community transmission of the disease.

'Generally it is local outbreaks, but there is also very worrying increases in cases, particularly over the last few days,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'That is what we are really keeping a close eye on - the extent to which it moves away from these local outbreaks to broader community transmission.

'What we saw in the last few days from this surveillance data was this worrying increase in cases which, as we know from the first wave of the pandemic, can potentially get out of hand if we don't be very serious about the control measures.'
