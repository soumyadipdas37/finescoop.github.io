Olivia's poignant post comes at a crossroads in the star's life as she is reportedly set to quit The Only Way Is Essex.  

The TV star joined the hit show in April last year, but after securing her own reality show, the blonde beauty may soon walk away from the long-running series.

A TV source told The Sun: 'Liv is focused on her own show and getting married. No one would be surprised if she left after this series.'

The former Love Island star has also revealed she's set to skip some filming for TOWIE in order to spend more time working on her own reality series, Meets Her Match.

She said: 'I will go missing a little bit later in the series due to commitments to my own show but I am involved in the tenth anniversary show.'
