Izzy Sharman-Firth's fun-loving personality landed her the first single date with Locky Gilbert after The Bachelor went into lockdown on Thursday's episode.

But fans have doubts about her future in the competition, pointing out that she has a rather bizarre habit that could spell trouble for Locky.

After her taco-and-bubble-bath date with the former Australian Survivor star, viewers flocked to Twitter to complain about her hyena-like laugh. 

Now THAT'S a red flag! The Bachelor's Izzy Sharman-Firth (pictured) has been roasted on social media for a bizarre habit - as viewers beg Locky Gilbert not to give her a rose 

'Izzy's laugh. Don't give her a rose. I can't do this again,' one viewer begged.

Another added: 'I'm sorry but Izzy is killing me with that laugh.'

Frustrated fans compared the 29-year-old HR consultant's shriek to everything from a 'hyena' to the Wicked Witch of the West.

'I'm sorry but Izzy is killing me with that laugh': One viewer begged Locky to not give the 29-year-old HR consultant a rose 

'Is it just me or does Izzy laugh like a hyena?' one asked on Twitter.  

Others jokingly questioned the real motive was behind the over-the-top laugh.

'This is very boring TV. And I feel Izzy's laugh is totally fake, it has to be... sorry Locky's just not that funny,' tweeted one skeptic.

Another added:'Does Locky really like Izzy or does he just like [that] she laughs hysterically at every unfunny thing he says?'

However, there were a handful of viewers who seemed to think that Izzy's laugh was the best thing about the show.

'OMG, Izzy's laugh is the best,' one supporter tweeted.

Surprise: During the Zoom date, Locky and Izzy cooked tacos before hopping into a bubble bath with a glass of wine 

Another added: 'Izzy has an infectious laugh.'

During the episode, Locky surprised Izzy by having a box delivered to her home containing all the ingredients for a Mexican feast.

The pair proceeded to cook tacos together over Zoom before hopping into a bubble bath with a glass of wine.

Flirty: Things turned flirty when Izzy jokingly complained that there were 'too many bubbles' in Locky's bath. 'Are you just getting me to stand up?' he asked, prompting her to respond, 'Yeah, I'd just like to see a little bit more of your skin.' (Locky also pictured)
