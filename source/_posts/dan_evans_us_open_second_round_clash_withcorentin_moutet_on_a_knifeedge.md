Dan Evans was forced to save two set points to save himself from a significant deficit before rain postponed his feisty US Open second round against Corentin Moutet.

The British number one will resume on Friday at 6-4 3-6 5-6, serving at advantage, after a stylish and occasionally tempestuous duel.

Moutet showed his creativity in coming back to make it a tight third set, having received a code violation for hurling his racket against the back fence in the opener.

Both players struggled to keep a lid on their frustrations in a match that has been full of skilful rallies between two men of relatively diminutive stature.

Evans will need to make a fast start if he is to make the third round against the winner of Andy Murray and Felix Auger-Aliassime. 

Cam Norrie is in third round action at 4pm UK against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.
