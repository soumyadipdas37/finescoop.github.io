Paris Hilton recently birthed a labor of love with her documentary This Is Paris, which premiered Monday on her YouTube.

And the New York-born socialite is aiming to bring another bundle of joy into the world, after revealing she froze her eggs.

The 39-year-old star recently opened up about her plans to start a family, which will include a set of boy/girl twins, and the mom-to-be already has another city name picked out for her baby girl.

Paris said on this week's episode of the podcast LadyGang: 'First one, we're planning it already, is going to be a boy and girl twin. When you freeze your eggs, you can pick if you get a boy, you get a girl, you get twins.'

She added: 'I have baby London, which is the girl, and I'm trying to figure out a name for the boy. So if you have any suggestions, I'm asking my friends. 

'I don't want a theme of cities, but I don't know — it's hard to decide. London for sure for the girl; the boy, I'm just still trying to decide on.'

Paris previously told The Sunday Times last month about wanting a girl: 'I’m obsessed with dressing them up and having a mini-me, or twins, because then you get both [girl and boy] at once.'

The Stars Are Blind artist said: 'I had a really amazing conversation with Kim about it. She introduced me to her doctor, and I was so inspired by her to actually do it.

'I think every woman should do it because you can really control it and not have that, "Oh my God, I need to get married."'

She recently celebrated another anniversary with boyfriend Carter Reum, 39, to whom she was first romantically linked in January at a Golden Globes after party.

Paris wrote in the Instagram tribute: 'When we first met, I had no idea of the amazing journey I was about to embark on. My life was always empty, like I was missing something. 

'But when I met you, I knew you were the one. You’ve filled my heart with so much love. I believe that everything happens for a reason because everything in my life, all the good and the bad, has led me right to you.

The Simple Life star said: 'I'm more focused on the future, and things that really matter, like family and the next phase of my life. 

'But things are going amazing business-wise, I just released my 27th fragrance, of course I'm going to continue always being a Boss Babe, because I love working hard, but I'm now going to put my personal life with my relationship ahead of my business.'
