Former Brookside actress Anna Norbury has died at the age of 26, with her mother paying tribute to her 'beautiful and innocent humanity'.

Anna was best known for playing Alice Farnham in the Channel 4 soap.

She died on September 7, her family have shared today.

Anna's mother Maria wrote in an obituary published in The Telegraph: 'She will be remembered for her warmth, her wit, her clarity, her forthrightness, and above all for her beautiful and innocent humanity.
