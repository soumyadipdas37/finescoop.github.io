She rose to fame in 1999 appearing in blockbuster films The Sixth Sense and Notting Hill.

And actress and reality star Mischa Barton was leaning in to the casual Friday look ahead of the weekend, when she was spotted taking her pooch for a walk in Los Angeles, California.

The O.C. star, 34, sported a cream cardigan for the outing, worn over a grey strappy top and black dress.

Mischa wore her dirty blond hair in an easy bun, and had on a necklace or two.

She had her smartphone tucked next to her ear at one point to take a call, and held a yellow leash as she peered at her brown and white dog who appeared to take a seat on the sidewalk.

On her feet, Barton wore black loafer slides with metal buckle accents. 

Mischa has recently been seen out enjoying some PDA with her boyfriend, Gian Marco Flamini.

Earlier this week, the pair were observed partaking in a romantic meal in Pasadena.

It's not known how long the two actors have been dating; Barton split from Australian male model James Abercrombie in August 2019, after more than two years together. 

Born in London and raised in New York, Barton divides her time between the U.S. and Europe.

Micha's most recent big screen role was as a passenger for a ride share driver played by Stranger Things star Joe Keery in the dark comedy Spree.

The movie, originally shown at Sundance, was released on video on demand last month and also features Franke Grande, Lala Kent and David Arquette.

Outside of that, The Hills: New Beginnings star has mainly figured in various horror vehicles of late, such as The Basement, Ouija House and The Toybox, all from 2018.
