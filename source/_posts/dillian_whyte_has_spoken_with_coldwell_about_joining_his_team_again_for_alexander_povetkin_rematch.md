Dillian Whyte has spoken with respected trainer Dave Coldwell about recalling him to his coaching team for his rematch with Alexander Povetkin, Sportsmail understands. 

The Brixton heavyweight had made several changes behind the scenes over the summer, parting company with long-time trainer Mark Tibbs to link up with Xavier Miller before his knockout defeat against Povetkin.

Coldwell, who's previously guided Tony Bellew and Jamie McDonnell to world titles, was also brought in by Whyte for that fight to bolster his team.

Sportsmail understands they have not discussed Coldwell re-joining his team at length but that there is a possibility Whyte could call on him again to play a role in the rematch as he looks to right the wrongs from last month's defeat, though nothing has yet been decided.

When put to Coldwell about potentially returning to help Whyte, he said: 'I don't know, that's down to Dillian to discuss with his people and his head coach Xavier to make that decision. 

'It's not my place to say what he is doing with his team and his camp, that's down to him and what he wants to decide.'

Whyte faces the highly-experienced Povetkin again on November 21st after being brutally knocked out in their first meeting.

Coldwell said witnessing the knockout from ringside was 'one of the most shocking experiences of my life' but is backing Whyte to claim revenge in the rematch.

'He's handled the loss really well,' Coldwell added. 'He got done by AJ earlier on in his career and look how he came back from that. And dare I say it the AJ fight, because of the beef, and pride as well that that would have been harder to deal with.

'I would imagine that was a bigger loss for him mentally to come back from and he handled that and came back in a fantastic way. So I don't see this being a problem.

'I think Dillian will make some tiny adjustments and finish off what he started and planned to do.'

At 32, Whyte cannot afford to lose again to Povetkin if he wants to maintain his ambitions of challenging for a world title - something he has been cruelly denied of despite holding the mandatory position to the WBC belt for over 1,000 days.

But even if the Brit was to come out on the losing end again, Coldwell insists his career would not be over.

'It is a big backwards step if he gets beaten. But you have only got to look at Dereck Chisora, it's not over until it's over. Especially in the heavyweight division, you're only a fight away from getting something big and probably only two wins away from getting a world title fight,' he said.

'They are frantically trying to get AJ and Fury to meet and all the belts to become one but that's not going to last for long because there's mandatories coming up for different organisations and whoever ends up winning it, if they can actually make the fight, basically as soon as they win it the belts will end up being fragmented again so you could have pairings off here, there and everywhere which will give a lot of these guys in the top 10 opportunities. 

'It's only over when you have no ambition left. Dillian isn't the type of guy to keep going just to get a pay cheque, it's the ambition with him, the same as Chisora. It's the ambition to become world champion or to at least get a crack at it that drives him.'
