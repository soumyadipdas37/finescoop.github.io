A dog really is a man, or a woman's, best friend. 

Jax, a two-year-old golden retriever, saved his owner from taking a tumble after she came home tipsy after a night out.

Hannah Quintus, 22, from Eagle Grove, Iowa, was heading to bed after a few drinks when she became unsteady on her feet.

Her observant dog Jax jumped up and steadied her with his two front paws, guiding her safely to the bed.    

A video camera in the room recorded the incredible footage and after some deliberation Hannah decided to share it online. 

The black-and-white footage shows Hannah removing some toys from her bed looking a little unsteady on her feet.

Jax attentively watches her with his tail wagging until he sees his owner swaying off balance.
