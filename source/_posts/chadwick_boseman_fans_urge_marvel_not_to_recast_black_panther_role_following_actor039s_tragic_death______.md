One fan appealed to the Disney-owned studio in a now viral tweet &#039;Don&#039;t recast that role @MarvelStudios. It&#039;s done.&#039;
Jeremy Conrad (who hosts the podcast MCU Cosmic) shared a similar sentiment &#039;Don&rsquo;t recast. He can&rsquo;t be replaced. #WakandaForever&#039;

While many seem to be in agreement that the character should be retired, some have also suggested passing on the Black Panther title to another fan favorite.
One person posted &#039;If Marvel chooses to continue the Black Panther series, don&rsquo;t recast T&rsquo;Challa, pass the title to Shuri, just my opinion.&#039;&nbsp;
Portrayed by&nbsp;Letitia Wright, Shuri is the younger sister of&nbsp;T&#039;Challa, and the innovative scientist behind much of Wakanda&#039;s advanced technology, making her a shoo-in.
Before his untimely death, Boseman had signed on to lead the upcoming Black Panther 2, which is set to premiered on May 6, 2022.
