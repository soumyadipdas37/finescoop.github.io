Kaley Cuoco shared a throwback picture with John Ritter on the 17th anniversary of his shock death of an aortic dissection.

They co-starred on the sitcom 8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter which he was rehearsing when he was taken ill and hospitalized, dying hours later.

'Can’t believe you have been gone 17 years... thank you for continuing to me make me laugh every single day,' wrote 34-year-old Kaley.

Kaley, who played one of the title teenage daughters on the sitcom, could be seen making a funny face as she posed with John for the black and white picture.

John starred opposite Katey Sagal as the parents of three teenagers played by Kaley, Amy Davidson and Martin Spanjers.

Season two was being made when John died on September 11, 2003, only six days before he would have celebrated his 55th birthday. Kaley was 17-years-old at the time.

One day before the show restarted filming in the wake of John's death, Kaley tearfully remembered him in an on-set interview with Entertainment Tonight.

'We always got together in the back, and we got in a little circle and we always, we did, John would look at us, all of us, and we'd do a prayer, and he'd look us in the eye, John would say: "I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you,"' she said.

A couple of years ago in a Reelz documentary about John she emotionally recalled their last-ever conversation, which took place in her dressing room.

'I go: "Hi!" I go: "Are you okay? I heard you're sick." He goes: "I'm okay, I just wanna talk to you for a second." And I was like: "Okay," and he sat down on the couch. He goes: "I love you,"' she shared, trying not to cry.

'And I was like: "I love you too, silly man!" He goes: "No, I want you to know I love you." I said: "I love you too." He goes: "That's it!" and he gave me a hug and that was the last I saw of him,' she said.

He was survived by his second wife Amy Yasbeck and his four children Jason, 40, Carly, 38, Tyler, 35, and Noah, 22.

After the Three's Company icon died the show killed off his character Paul and was eventually renamed 8 Simple Rules.

The sitcom managed to last through the end of its third season at which point it was canceled by ABC after plunging in the ratings.

'I truly believe if John had still been around we probably would have gone on for a long time,' Kaley told Yahoo! Entertainment this year.

She shared that 'even though I only spent a year with him, that changed the course of my personal life and my career and I knew I wanted to make people laugh forever after working with John. That year really changed me in every way.'

Kaley went on to achieve global fame on the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory and Katey won critical acclaim on the FX drama Sons Of Anarchy.
