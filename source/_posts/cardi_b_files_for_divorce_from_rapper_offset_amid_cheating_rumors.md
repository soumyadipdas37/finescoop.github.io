Cardi B has filed for divorce from her rapper husband Offset. 

The WAP star filed court documents in Georgia on Tuesday and the documents show it is a 'contested divorce,' according to TMZ. 

Cardi and Offset were secretly married in 2017 and share two-year-old daughter Kulture.

In her divorce filing, she 'is seeking primary physical custody as well as legal custody' of their little girl.

The Bronx-born recording artist is also seeking child support, although TMZ states the exact amount is still unclear.

A contested divorce usually stipulates that both parties involved have not come to an agreement regarding an equal division of assets, which then requires judicial oversight. 

Cardi, who's real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar, previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018 just months after they secretly wed. 

The rapper was allegedly involved in a sex tape scandal with another woman in 2017, which she addressed on Twitter.

'No, it’s not right for a [n****] to cheat…But what you want me to do? Cardi wrote. Go f*** me another n****? Start all over again and get cheated on again? This s*** happens to everyone and I be too, you too…People handle they relationship different soo.'
