Highlighting her toned arms, the singer looked sensational in the vibrant two-piece, which featured a barely-there triangle bralet and matching briefs. 

The Don't Start Now star showcased her clear complexion by going make-up free, and scraped her shoulder-length tresses into a slick bun. 

Dainty earrings, a gold necklace and quirky yellow-lens glasses rounded off the musician's appearance.

Smitten: A day earlier, the media personality enjoyed a romantic hike with her boyfriend Anwar Hadid as she continued to take a brief break from her work duties 

Dua has upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar.

The Sun reported The One Kiss hitmaker has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK. 

A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end. 

'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic. 

'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time.
