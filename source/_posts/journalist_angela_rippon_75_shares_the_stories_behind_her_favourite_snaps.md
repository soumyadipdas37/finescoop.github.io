Journalist Angela Rippon, 75, shares the stories behind her favourite snaps

1955: I grew up in Plymouth, which had been bombed so badly in the war that housing was at a premium, so we lived with my grandparents. My playgrounds were bombsites and I didn’t see my Royal Marine father John until I was three. He was in Japan when the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima. My mother Edna had been a lorry driver in the ATS – she was a great role model

1976: It was such fun to do the Morecambe And Wise Christmas Special. Even though the two of them were huge stars, they made you feel like you were doing them a huge favour being on their programme. Eric couldn’t help himself, he had to be funny and Ernie [pictured] was the serious one – he was more astute, but wonderful company

1978: Here I am as the first presenter of Top Gear. I’ve always enjoyed driving. I passed my driving test young and used to drive my father’s Rover 90 in my school uniform. I like cars that are driveable, which is why I have sports cars. I’ve had a bright yellow Triumph GT6 and MGs and MGBs and Japanese sports cars. I try to be more sensible now and have a Honda Hybrid. I also have one of the first-ever Minis. It came off the production line in 1960. It may be one of the oldest Minis on the road

1979: This was taken to celebrate 25 years of BBC TV News. Famous faces include Kenneth Kendall [back row, third from right], Richard Whitmore [sitting next to me] and Richard Baker [next to him]. I joined BBC News in the mid-70s as a correspondent. We didn’t wear flak jackets then and I got hit in the shoulder while doing a story about snipers in Northern Ireland. I thought I’d been shot but it was someone throwing stones! Later, I sat in as Richard Baker’s holiday replacement reading the news, then was asked to do it permanently. There was a definite division between the public who thought it was great to have a woman reading the news, and the Press who thought it extraordinary that a woman could actually do that job. I found that patronising

1981: Along with Andrew Gardner from ITN we did the interview from the Orangery in Buckingham Palace two days before the royal wedding. The final thing I had to say to them was, ‘We wish you a long and very happy life together.’ Charles said, ‘Thank you very much’, and looked affectionately across to Diana – who looked away from him and down at the floor. Perhaps she already had an indication that Charles did not love her as much as she loved him. I think he was enormously fond of her and very protective of her. One can always speculate, but that doesn’t mean your speculation is accurate

1981: I always enjoyed interviewing Margaret Thatcher. Once I’d worked out how she wanted to conduct the interview, it was then easy to do the first part the way she wanted it, and the second part the way I wanted it. She had a great sense of humour and could be very warm, especially when she was with her husband Denis. But when she was in front of the camera, she was the Prime Minister and protected her hard-won image. She wasn’t going to be frivolous

1998: My parents would spend Christmas with me in my flat in Notting Hill. My mother was diagnosed with dementia in 2004, the year after my father died, so I got in touch with Alzheimer’s Society to ask them for help. For many people the helpline is not just the first port of call when they discover dementia in the family, but it becomes a lifeline. My mother continued to spend Christmas with me after her diagnosis – even though she wouldn’t remember it, she would have enjoyed the moment

2011: Dancing and ballet have been my passions since my mother sent me to classes to help my knock-knees. I was also a presenter on Come Dancing for four years so I was thrilled to be asked to be part of Strictly Come Dancing’s Children In Need special with all the girls who were involved in news at that time: Sian Williams, Sophie Raworth, Susannah Reid and Emily Maitlis. I was not, of course. They just got me to come in at the end and jump out of a box. At least it proves I can still do the splits
