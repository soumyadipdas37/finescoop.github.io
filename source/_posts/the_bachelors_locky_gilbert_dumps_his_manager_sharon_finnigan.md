The Bachelor's Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert has parted ways with celebrity agent Sharon Finnigan after working together for just six months.

Daily Mail Australia can reveal the 31-year-old terminated his agreement with SF Management last month, while The Bachelor was in full swing.

'Sharon's not my manager...she's f**king over,' Locky said on Friday night when asked who was representing him.

Ms Finnigan offered a more polite statement when approached for comment on Tuesday morning.

Locky is now being managed by a former employee of Ms Finnigan's.

Daily Mail Australia understands that Ms Finnigan was not surprised to see Locky sign with one of her ex-staffers.

A source said: 'They had no connection and Sharon wasn't a fan of Locky's work. They had different plans for his future and he just wanted out.'

SF Management had confirmed its partnership with Locky on April 22, just a month after he was announced as Channel 10's new Bachelor.

'Welcome aboard @locklangilbert looking forward to you joining our family. Coming soon,' the agency wrote on Instagram, to which Locky responded: 'Happy to be a part of the team, guys.'

Ms Finnigan has a number of stars on her books, including former WAGs Kyly Clarke and Phoebe Burgess, and MasterChef alum Reynold Poernomo. 

Sharon once represented breakfast TV stars Karl Stefanovic and Sam Armytage, but both have since parted ways with SF Management.
