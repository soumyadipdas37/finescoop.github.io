A mother has been arrested and charged with stabbing her five-year-old daughter to death on Chicago’s West Side during another bloody weekend in the city, which was marked by at least 51 shootings, nine of them fatal.

Officers were called to a home in the 3200 block of West Fulton Boulevard at around 9.30am on Saturday and found paramedics already working on the girl, identified as Serenity Arrington. She had been stabbed multiple times.  

The Cook County medical examiner’s office said Serenity was taken to Stroger Hospital where she was pronounced dead.

The five-year-old had been stabbed multiple times in the neck, resulting in her death 

An autopsy conducted on Sunday showed the child died of 'multiple incised wounds' to the neck and declared her death a homicide.

Serenity's mother, 27-year-old Simone Austin, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder after walking up to the police at the scene of the crime. 

According to investigators, the stabbing took place inside the house of Serenity’s grandfather. Police revealed they were familiar with the residence from previous calls for service. 

'There were prior calls to the address. We just don’t know at this time why … what happened today. But there were multiple calls,' Chicago police officer Jose Jara told WGN.

Neighbors said Austin had moved to the block about a month ago with Serenity, her sisters and their pet cat. They recalled seeing the woman sit outside while her daughters played.

No motive has been revealed but investigators are trying to determine whether Austin has had a history of mental illness.

The mother is due in court for a bond hearing later today.
