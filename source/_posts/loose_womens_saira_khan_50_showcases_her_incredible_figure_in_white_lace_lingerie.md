She embarked on a fitness journey earlier this year, enlisting personal trainer Bradley Simmonds to help her tone-up ahead of taking part in a bikini competition. 

And Saira Khan showcased her incredible figure in white lace lingerie as she took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a candid comparison post. 

The Loose Women presenter, 50, posted a boomerang video of herself 'holding my tummy in' before breathing out to show her stomach at its relaxed state.

In a lengthy post, she told fans: 'We inhale and exhale, our tummy goes in and it comes out - that’s how we breathe, that’s how we stay alive.

'My tummy is not flat. It is rounded and when I eat, it gets full and gets rounder still. This is totally and utterly normal. If I did not eat - my tummy would be flat.'

After describing how she 'loves to eat', Saira continued: 'A 6 pack is not always a sign of a healthy body. Some people have gone to extremes to get one. Sometimes they have to virtually starve - that’s not healthy.

Stunning: Saira said: 'My tummy is not flat. It is rounded and when I eat, it gets full and gets rounder still. This is totally and utterly normal. If I did not eat - my tummy would be flat.'

'But a strong core, that allows me to live my life with quality and able to the things I want to do, is why I work it. A strong core also gives me confidence and comfort in my clothes. 

'My core is my strength. So next time you look at your amazing figure - connect your mind to your core, remember it’s purpose - it’s there to hold you up strong and proud.

'Looking at someone else’s core and comparing it to yours, is an exercise that is pointless - look, admire respect and then work yours. Engage, feel and love your core today.'

Back in May, Saira shared her delight as she revealed her impressive weight loss while modelling a pair of jeans from her twenties which she couldn't fit into in February, when she began the challenge. 

She wrote in the caption: 'I did it!! From 2nd Feb 2020 until today May 15th , I’ve been working hard with my PT @bradleysimmonds to fulfil a personal dream. 

'I wanted to feel fit and fab at 50! I honestly can say today, right now, in this moment I am the happiest I have ever been in my life.  I have my health, my family and friends and a birthday cake.'
