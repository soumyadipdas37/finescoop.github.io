A man arrested following the fatal shooting of police sergeant Matt Ratana on suspicion of supplying a firearm was released on bail today.

The man from Norwich was bailed until October as police searches continued at the home of alleged gunman Louis De Zoysa, 23, in Norbury, South London.

Detectives investigating the murder of Sergeant Ratana at Croydon custody centre last Friday have also been searching an area in Banstead, Surrey.

But they are yet to speak to De Zoysa, who is in a critical condition in hospital after he shot himself as he opened fire with a revolver while handcuffed behind his back.

The Banstead location includes access to several derelict buildings and more than 30 acres of land, with police saying the 'complex' search will take days to complete.

The custody centre remains a crime scene, while searches in Pollards Hill, where De Zoysa was arrested, and a location in central London have also been carried out.

It came as further details about De Zoysa emerged yesterday, including that he excelled at the Catholic John Fisher School in Purley, South London.

De Zoysa, whose school yearbook entry said he was 'good with weapons', went on to study mechanical engineering at University College London.

Friends said he was very intelligent but dropped out after just a year. De Zoysa and his four siblings were brought up by their translator mother and yoga teacher father.

Friends have previously spoken of their middle-class lifestyle and his younger brother now attends Oxford University.

Police searches have been taking place at Banstead in Surrey as well as in South London

But one neighbour who knew the family well said the De Zoysa house was notorious in the street for loud arguments and aggressive dogs which were bred for money.

Speaking yesterday, the source said that his father Channa, from Sri Lanka, struggled to hold down regular employment.

The neighbour also claimed to have witnessed arguments which spilled out into the street.

It backs up reports that De Zoysa's British mother, Elizabeth, took out a restraining order against her husband in 2015. This was withdrawn last year when they reconciled.

The neighbour added that she filed a police report when De Zoysa was in his early teens, claiming to have heard gun shots from the garden of the property.

'Some neighbours felt bullied by them,' she said. 'The family were known because their dogs would bark all the time. They were like wild guard dogs.

'The family had some really bad problems. I would often hear loud arguments with very strong language. '

Metropolitan Police officer Sgt Ratana was shot when De Zoysa, who had been arrested for alleged possession of ammunition and Class B drugs in south London, was brought into his police station in Croydon.

Despite being cuffed and searched outside, the suspect is believed to have smuggled a revolver inside and shot Sgt Ratana as he took his temperature to comply with Covid regulations.

Five shots were fired at 2.15am on Friday, including one which left De Zoysa in hospital. Detectives have as yet been unable to speak to him.

Girlfriend Su Bushby, 44, who lived with Sgt Ratana in Worthing, Sussex, has called him her 'gentle giant' and 'soulmate'.

A fund in his memory has been set up by the Metropolitan Police's Hayes Sports Club.

The New Zealand-born officer joined Scotland Yard in 1991 and was head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club. His grown-up son lives overseas.

Officers in his home country yesterday honoured Sgt Ratana with a haka as part of their Police Remembrance Day.

And today, New Zealand Rugby said in a statement: 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of #SgtMattRatana whose loss is being felt hard across the rugby and police community in both the UK and New Zealand. Rest In Peace Sergeant Matt.'
