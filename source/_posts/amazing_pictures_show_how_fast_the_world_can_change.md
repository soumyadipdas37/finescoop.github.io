These amazing pictures, taken years apart from each other, highlight how drastically and quickly the world can change in a few decades. 

From Los Angeles to Stoke-on-Trent or Singapore, these incredible before-and-after photographs taken within decades of one another show how much a place can changed over the years.

The pictures, which were shared in an online gallery by Bored Panda,  include the bay of Singapore in 2000 and 2020 as it experienced a building frenzy.

Meanwhile in Tokyo, one person took a picture of himself at the exact same spot his grandfather did 73 years earlier in 1946 to compare the change in the city. 

A series of pictures shared by people on Bored Panda show how specific places have changed throughout the decades. Pictured left: Singapore in 2000. Pictured right: Singapore now

Some areas have changed so much they're unrecognisable (pictured left, Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima pictured shortly after the city was hit by an atomic bomb in 1945. Right: The Dome, now a war memorial, in 2020)
