Forrest Fenn, the author and artifacts dealer who led thousands of treasure hunters on a chase for a $3 million chest of gold in the Rocky Mountains, has died. He was 90.

Fenn died of natural causes on Monday at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, police spokesman Greg Gurulé told the New Mexican.

For 10 years, thousands of thrill seekers followed the clues left in a poem he published in 2010, seeking the chest full of gold he stowed somewhere in the Rocky Mountains.

In June of this year, he announced that the treasure had been found, but refused to reveal where it had been hidden, saying he had promised the lucky winner he would keep it a secret. 

Developing story, more to follow.
