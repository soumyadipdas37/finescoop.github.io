The creative force behind one of Australia's hottest new apps met each other by accident in an Uber.  

David Wareing, Tim Nicholas and Silje Dreyer are the entrepreneurs behind GetReminded - a free digital platform dreamed up in a Sydney rideshare that reminds users when their bills, policies, mobile phone plans and insurance premiums are up for renewal. 

According to the trio, the simple idea is saving users thousands of dollars a year, they told Daily Mail Australia.

It all started when Mr Wareing returned from overseas after spending about a decade working in motor vehicle marketing. 

'The holy grail in automotive marketing was knowing when people wanted to change their car,' Mr Wareing said.

'I thought, instead of brands just spraying messages to people all the time, isn't it better to understand customers a little more, so they know what they need and when they need it?' 

He had returned to Sydney and was working as an Uber driver when he picked up Mr Nicholas in 2017 - a digital marketing and website development specialist who had the kind of expertise needed to raise money, promote the concept and get the idea of the ground.

But the pair were still one short when it came to technical experience and design capabilities.

Until the day Ms Dreyer showed up in the back of Mr Wareing's Uber.   

'I have a Master's in interactive design from the University of Sydney and had been working in the sector for a few years,' she said.

'When I met David I was very skeptical at first, but I was really intrigued and I just thought there might really be something here.

'We talked about the idea and I just had a gut feeling... I also had nothing to lose.'

In July 2017, the business went live. 

'We started it with a website only. In the tech world they call it a minimum viable product - just to see what the take up would be,' Mr Nicholas said.

'We discovered very quickly that most people were accessing it on their mobile so we knew we have to build this as an app.

'We build version one of our app in just a few months with seed funding, now we are on version three.'

Australia has been a hotbed of start up success with billion-dollar unicorns like Atlassian, Afterpay, Nearmap, Airwallex and 10x Genomics.

GetReminded already has over 23,000 users in Australia and New Zealand, and last month the company launched in the UK and Ireland.

In the near future, GetReminded plans to expand into the US and other markets after securing more funding to scale up and raise brand awareness.     

'There are some calendar apps and reminder services out there but nobody is replicating what we're doing,' Ms Dreyer said.

'What's unique is that it gives you a lot of reminders leading up expiry dates, most apps usually give you a reminder when it's too late and you don't have time to look for a better deal.'

'We are not trying to be a bill paying app, we are not a comparison site, we are not fintech, we are not lending money to people, we are just focused on giving users good consumer help,' Mr Wareing said.
