The shocking final hours of five men's lives have been laid bare in an inquest after they took a synthetic drug they believed was similar to MDMA.

The men, aged between 17 and 32 who were not known to one another, all died in separate tragic incidents across 2016 and 2017.

One man threw himself off a 10th floor balcony, Victoria Police Leading Senior Constable Duncan McKenzie told the Coroners Court of Victoria on Wednesday. 

A second man was restrained by concerned friends for 20 minutes before he stopped breathing, with another unable to recall his name in the hours before his passing.

A fourth man fatally hit his head against a piece of furniture when having a seizure, with the fifth man dying due to a combination of brain damage and organ failure a few hours after he was taken to hospital.    

Dimitri Gerostamoulos, the chief toxicologist from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, told the court the substance the men all consumed was a deadly combination of two synthetic drugs: 25C-NBOMe, a hallucinogenic with similarities to LSD, and 4-Fluoroamphetamine, a stimulant similar to meth. 

'When taken together, the deadly substances can destroy the body’s ability to flush them out,' he said.

'They also tend to stay longer in a person's system and further to that, can lead to cardiac arrest and brain damage.'

The purpose of the inquest is to find out what is widely known about the synthetic drug, from a local perspective as well as globally.

The inquest will also delve into ways to prevent a similar party drug resulting in more deaths, coroner Paresa Spanos said.
