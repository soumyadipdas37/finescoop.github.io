Lea Michele has been basking in the glow of motherhood, since welcoming her first child last month.

But the two-time Golden Globe nominee is also managing to steal away for some quality adult time.

She cut an activewear chic look in black and white Monday, as she stepped out with husband Zandy Reich for a walk through their upscale Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of gold-framed Ray-Ban aviators and a black face mask, keeping safe from COVID-19.
