Meg Ryan has found herself back in the market, following her split from fiancé John Mellencamp late last year.

But the three-time Golden Globe nominee appears to be living her best life, as she isolates amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

She cut a cool look Sunday in a baby t-shirt and baggy pants, as she stepped out to run some errands in Los Angeles, during a break from quarantine.

The 58-year-old showed off her trim figure in a white baby tee, printed with a black star on the chest.

She complemented the top with some baggy army green trousers and a pair of black trainers with white soles.

Ryan finished the ensemble with some square gold-framed sunglasses and a blue face mask, taking precautions against COVID-19.

She took off a puffy black jacket, as she stepped out of her car and into the sizzling SoCal summer sun.

A source told People in November: 'He didn’t want to get married again... He loves her, but marriage never seemed to be a part of it.

'It’s unclear how important a marriage was to Meg. But they spent a lot of time together and it’s too bad they split. They really got along so well together.'     

The Sleepless in Seattle star was previously married to Dennis Quaid, 66, from 1991-2001, sharing son Jack Henry, 28, and daughter Daisy True, 16.
