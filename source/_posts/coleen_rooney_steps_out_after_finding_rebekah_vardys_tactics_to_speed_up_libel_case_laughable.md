She has reportedly called her arch rival Rebekah Vardy's 'strong-armed tactics' to speed up their £1million lawsuit 'laughable'.

And Coleen Rooney cut a casual figure as she stepped out in Cheshire on Tuesday, before heading home in her £100,000 Mercedes. 

The WAG, 34, looked sporty in a white hoodie and black leggings as she popped out to withdraw some money from a ATM.

She donned a pair of black trainers, sunglasses and tied her hair back into a low ponytail. 

Coleen failed to raise a smile on the solo outing.  

It comes as the mother-of-four has reportedly declared she 'won't be bullied' by Rebekah, 38, when their libel case goes to court.

Rebekah is said to have signed legal papers in a bid to get Coleen to head to court 'immediately' amid their ongoing WAG war.  

But a source told The Sun last weekend that 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'

Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'.

It was reported on Friday that Rebekah has filed the papers under the impression that Coleen is 'dragging her heels' following her bombshell accusations she has been selling stories about her to The Sun. 

According to reports, the session, which will be held later this year, will determine whether the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy was 'libelled' when Coleen accused her Instagram account of leaking stories to the press. 

A source told the publication: 'Things have been rumbling on for ages, and costs ­spiralling too.

'This will mean that a judge can actually get to the crux of the case — and make those involved put up or shut up. It should mean things can finally get moving and dealt with quickly.

'This is a shot across the bows. It effectively says, "Come on, stop mucking about, let’s get on with this".'

MailOnline reached out to Rebekah and Coleen's representatives for comment at the time of publication. 

The two are currently engaged in an ongoing feud which began when Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies.
