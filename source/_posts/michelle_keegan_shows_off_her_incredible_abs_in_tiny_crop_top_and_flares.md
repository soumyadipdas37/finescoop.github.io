She's been working hard, following her husband Mark Wright's training regime this summer.

And Michelle Keegan showed off the results of her hours in the gym in a sizzling Instagram post on Sunday night.

The actress wowed in a tiny crop top and satin flares as she snapped a selfie in the makeup chair ahead of a photoshoot.

Wow! Michelle Keegan showed off the results of her hours in the gym in a sizzling Instagram post on Sunday, flaunting her incredible abs in a behind the scenes shot from a recent shoot

The throwback shot showed Michelle getting glam with the help of her masked makeup and hair crew.

Taking the photo in the mirror, the actress flaunted her incredibly toned abs in her racy ensemble as she playfully pouted for the camera. 

'Last week ( I wish I would of taken the trousers home now),' she captioned the stunning shot.

Michelle's new Instagram post came just hours after her husband Mark Wright's ex fianceé Lauren Goodger posted throwback snaps of the pair while marking 10 years in the spotlight ahead of the TOWIE reunion special on Sunday.

The reality star, 33, took to Instagram to thank the famous show for providing her with meaningful 'memories' and insisted she's 'proud' of all her castmates.

Childhood sweethearts Lauren and Mark, 33, became engaged on TOWIE, after both starring since its inauguration in 2010, and were a couple for 11 years before suffering an extremely acrimonious break-up which has led to much mud-slinging. 

Despite their bitter split, the Celebs Go Dating star brushed aside their past drama to upload images of them winning the Audience Award at the 2011 BAFTA Awards.

The media personality wrote in an accompanying caption: '10 years ago changed my life we created a show called 'the only way is Essex' I was 22 when I first started filming and what an amazing journey this has been !!

'I put my life on national television and we won a BAFTA - not a lot people can say that ! You've seen me laugh, cry, engaged, break ups and make ups ! I've grown up on the screens and it was all real! 

'Congratulations to all the OGs @towie these images are from google thank you for memories and well to all my costars im proud of you all and always will be.' (sic)

Mark and Lauren were believed to be on bad terms ever since they called it quits, and the former Extra host went on to tie the knot to actress Michelle in May 2015.

Model Lauren previously branded their marriage 'weird' and claimed they don't speak to each other.
