Each week throughout the 2020-21 season, Sportsmail will bring you a Power Rankings table, listing the top-10 hottest players in the Premier League.

As the stories of the season unravel, the rankings will provide a form guide with players moving in and out of the top 10 depending on both their performances in the previous fixtures and also in recent weeks.

So, in a gameweek which saw a 100th-minute penalty awarded after the final whistle, Manchester City hit for five at home, the handball rule getting people very angry and Andy Robertson going from zero to hero for Liverpool, there was a lot to unpack.

With all of that in mind, how do Sportsmail's latest batch of Power Rankings look? 

10. Jarrod Bowen - West Ham (new entry)

Just when West Ham were being written off, up stepped Jarrod Bowen. 

His brace against Wolves were his first goals for the club since his full debut back in February and having arrived for £25million from Hull, there will be expectations that if West Ham are to stay up this season, Bowen is absolutely key. 

Deployed on the right wing, the key for Bowen to remain effective - and in Sportsmail's power rankings - is to remain a goal threat.

His first against Wolves was brilliant, cutting inside off the right before curling into the corner while the second showed great instinct after Pablo Fornals' shot hit the post. 

Leicester, Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool are the next four league assignments so things will only get tougher for Bowen from here.

9. Callum Robinson - West Brom (new entry)

Another new entry and this time it is West Brom's Callum Robinson. 

When you strike a brace to leave star-studded Chelsea stunned - and 3-0 down - you've more than done enough to force a way into the rankings. 

Impressing on loan last season off the left, his contribution against Chelsea suggests his long-term future is through the middle.

Both finishes were clinical and what many expected would have been evidenced on the day by Chelsea's Timo Werner - only for the German to draw a blank as he eyes his first goal for the club. 

Robinson's versatility is impressive but Bilic prefers him through the middle and if that persists, expect his goal return to soar.  

Callum Robinson had lots of reasons to smile as his brace left Chelsea speechless on Saturday

8. Patrick Bamford - Leeds (new entry)

Given his struggles in the second tier, many would have been forgiven for holding major concerns about Patrick Bamford's suitability as a Premier League striker. 

His record showed just 16 goals from 45 games in the Championship and given the increase in quality, the improved defenders he would be facing, the omens did not look great for the 27-year-old.

But three goals and an assist in three games is writing a very different chapter of his life in the Premier League and Bamford's consistency against Liverpool, Fulham and Sheffield United has seen him more than earn a rankings spot. 

His winner at Sheffield United could prove vital down the line as Leeds not only look to survive this year but instead finish in the top half.

Much was made about Leeds needing a goalscorer but Bamford's form suggests they may be OK as they are.

7. Son Heung-min - Tottenham (down six)

Not the weekend many Tottenham fans - and Fantasy Football owners - had expected from the South Korean.

His four goals away to Southampton were breathtaking and that will remain one of the best individual performances over the entire season. 

But blunted against Newcastle and hooked at half-time due to a hamstring injury, Son's influence was close to nil and the fact he is now facing an extended spell on the sidelines does not help his six-place drop. 

An inevitable fall out of the rankings awaits... but given the Spurs winger's immense quality, it is unlikely to be too long before he is back in contention for top spot.  

6. Emiliano Martinez (up three)

Aston Villa survived by the skin of their teeth last season and early indicators in 2020-21 suggest they have no intention of cutting it quite so fine this time round. 

For that they need a meaner defence. They shipped 67 goals last year, only rock-bottom Norwich City conceded more. 

Dean Smith targeted a goalkeeper and lucked out in coaxing Emiliano Martinez out of Arsenal, amid interest from Brighton, and he has been superb in the opening two league games.

Two games, two clean sheets. Not half bad. 

His toughest assignment to date in a Villa shirt comes next when champions Liverpool come to Villa Park. But given the club kept just seven Premier League clean sheets last season and they already have two, things are going in the right direction and Martinez is a big part of the reason why.  

Emiliano Martinez is fast becoming the purchase of the window in goal for Aston Villa

5. Wilfried Zaha (down three)

It speaks volumes that Saturday's 2-1 loss to Everton was the first time in four years that in a home league game Wilfried Zaha did not dribble past a single opponent. 

Everton focused in on the Ivorian having seen him at his best in the win over his former side Manchester United the week prior. 

A slip of three places in the rankings is fair given he was played in a more central role and garnered little joy from Everton's big, physical centre backs. 

Chelsea, Brighton and Fulham in the next three will provide him with very different defences to get his mojo back.  

Two in-form sides met and while Zaha remained a menace, he emerged on the losing side

4. James Rodriguez (up two)

The Colombian is just brilliant, a joy to watch and his stock is only going to escalate if he continues to put in performances as he did in a tricky game away to Palace.

He is the creative force in a team that is being front-run by Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

But Rodriguez's impact cannot be measured purely on his own goal return.

He has the trust of Carlo Ancelotti and that is key and no player in this side has created more chances in the league this season than Rodriguez. 

Having not played consistently in such a long time, keeping him fit is key. Do that and the sky is the limit for Ancelotti's Everton.  

James Rodriguez is rolling back the years and is getting Everton fans excited to see their side

3. Jamie Vardy (new entry)

The highest of the new entries but there should be absolutely no complaints on this one. 

Jamie Vardy had a party in Manchester and it even got a little bit out of hand as his hat-trick paved the way for Leicester to hit hosts Manchester City for five. 

The hat-trick takes him to five league goals for the season following his opening day brace against West Brom. If he is ageing, he has a funny way of showing it. 

Two of his goals in Manchester came from the penalty spot, the other a sumptuous backheel flick beyond Ederson at the near post following a cross down the right by Timothy Castagne. 

His confidence is oozing and with a determination to defend his Golden Boot, Vardy doesn't seem to have plans to slow down any time soon. 

Jamie Vardy was shy of touches but not of influence as he tore Manchester City to pieces

2. Sadio Mane (up one)

Whether he should even have been on the pitch is a debate in itself but the facts are he was and boy did he make it count. 

The goal he scored, to make it 1-1, was a tap-in, one of those that would end up on a DVD showreel if he had missed it. 

But his performance was sublime - yet again - and his constant pressing is priceless to the way Jurgen Klopp wants his team to play.

Arsenal's wing backs and centre backs had no time to dwell on the ball with the Senegalese never far away and that set a precedent for his team-mates as they came from behind to win the game. 

Klopp's embrace with him when he was taken off with 10 minutes left was a sign of his gratitude to a player that few can compare to at the top level. 

An absolute gem.  

Sadio Mane's consistency is astounding and he was on hand to get Liverpool going on Monday

1. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (up three)

Ta-da... No 1.

The Englishman really deserves it having been one of the stand-out players so far this season. 

Working on the training ground with Duncan Ferguson and absorbing every piece of wisdom shared by Ancelotti, Calvert-Lewin looks like a man who feels like he cannot miss right now. 

Such has been his form, Ancelotti has challenged him to kick on and strive for Didier Drogba-levels of greatness - no easy benchmark to reach, it has to be said.

But Ancelotti has worked with Drogba during Chelsea's 2010 Double-winning season and does see similarities between the Ivorian and Calvert-Lewin. 

He is top of the scoring charts right now, netting 1.8 goals every 90 minutes and his match-winning contribution against Tottenham set the tone for what followed against West Brom and Palace.

With Brighton next and then a Merseyside Derby to follow, now comes the test of how he performs when the light shines brightest on him.  

Dominic Calvert-Lewin is in the form of his life right now and Everton are all the better for it
