Sitting across Michael while wearing her dazzling engagement ring, Ashley explains the agreement would be a protective measure for herself and their one-year-old son Dean in the event the transgression occurs again.

'My idea that I did have and that I wanted to see how you felt about was doing a post-nuptial agreement. Something that would be protecting Dean and me in the event that this happens again,' she explains.

Michael remains silent after her proposal, processing the heavy news.

'Hmm,' he manages before another brief pause.

Efficiency: In a confessional, Ashley said she wanted a post-nup because the legal document would 'speed up the process in the event of a divorce' 

'We can look at that,' he adds.

In a confessional, Ashley goes into further detail about her intention behind the post-nupt.

'Michael and I had a pre-nuptial agreement that expired after five years of marriage,' Ashley explains. 'Now, in the event of a divorce, I will receive fifty percent of our assets. And now, I think it would be good for us to have a post-nuptial agreement because post-nup would outline things that are guaranteed to get, no arguing, no disputing, and essentially would speed up the process in the event of a divorce.'

Back with her husband, Ashley expresses her appreciation for his willingness to be open to the idea.

Painful chapter: The post-nuptial update comes after Ashley gave her husband an ultimatum on Sunday's episode of The Real Housewives Of Potomac

'I don't really know what it would say, but so glad you're open to it,' she says.

'I want to make sure that you're happy, and that I look after you in the right way. I think that's important right now,' he said.

'I agree,' Ashley replies.

Ashley explained while they had had romances in the past with other people, she no longer wanted to do that.

She also said if she found news about his other dalliances, it would be 'catastrophic for our relationship.'

'We're not gonna stay together just for Dean,' she told Michael. 'If I find out anything else, it will be catastrophic for our relationship.'

The couple's marriage has been in trouble after rumors of Michael's alleged dalliances came to light.

Real Housewives Of Potomac stars Candiace Dillard Bassett and Gizelle Bryant came forth with text messages that alleged that Michael was with several strippers, telling people he had a wife and a boyfriend, and apparently trying to hook up, despite being married.

Michael explained to his wife that he and his friends had been talking to some women at a strip club, before one of the ladies offered to go to a hotel with him.

'Michael said, "I was so drunk, I fell asleep, and when I woke up, she was laying in the bed next to me,"' Ashley recalled.

'Then when Michael gets out of bed to check the time, she snapped a picture of him from behind at the dresser and gave it to a blog.' 

Ashley and Michael are now expecting their second child together.   

The Real Housewives of Potomac air Sundays 9/8c on Bravo.
