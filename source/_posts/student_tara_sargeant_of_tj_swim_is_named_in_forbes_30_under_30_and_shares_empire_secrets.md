When Tara Sargent re-purposed $10,000 intended for an overseas trip into launching her own bikini line as a student at age 21, she could have had no idea just how big it would be.

But fast forward three years, and the 24-year-old Australian entrepreneur is now the CEO of the multi-million-dollar swimwear business TJ Swim, beloved by the likes of Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Addison Rae.

Tara was also named as one of the 30 most influential people in business under the age of 30 for 2019.

The 24-year-old began her lucrative business in her parents' laundry when she was just 21.

Spotting a 'gap in the market' when it came to quality swimwear, Tara told FEMAIL she wanted to make bikinis with cheeky Brazilian coverage that lasted 'more than one summer'.

My sole priority has always been to produce premium quality swimwear that complements all body shapes and sizes,' Tara told Daily Mail Australia.

'Our suits are specifically designed to empower women to be confident with their curves.'

Each bikini and swimsuit is handmade in Bali, a destination that Tara used to visit often, with premium quality fabrics to ensure a unique standard of sophistication.

Within months of launching TJ Swim, the business took off, with thousands of shoppers rushing to the young designer's website to snap up some high cut swimwear.

TJ Swim is currently valued at around $3million, and has a cult following of celebrities and influencers.

Tara has also made a splash at international fashion weeks, including Miami Swim Week, with her new neutral capsule collection set to launch this October.
