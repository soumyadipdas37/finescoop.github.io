The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert has confirmed he is still madly in love with the winner from the show. 

The 31-year-old adventure seeker spoke to Perth Now on Sunday, while promoting the Western Australian indoor skydiving championships.  

Locky told the publication that 'the girl I'm in love with' could not attend the event.

The strapping Bachelor added his friends also could not attend.  

'My friends are used to me doing all kinds of stuff and they're like, ''We can't keep up with you'',' he added.

Locky admitted he had never done indoor skydiving before but he did some training before flying high.

Adventurous spirit! 'We did like an hour's worth of training this week and now we're in the championship,' Locky finished 

'We did like an hour's worth of training this week and now we're in the championship,' he finished. 

It comes amid news the girls of the Bachelor mansion will have to contend with a new blonde bombshell, Bec Cvilikas, on the show.    

In a teaser trailer for this week's episodes, host Osher Günsberg tells the remaining ladies another woman has entered the competition via video link.

'She's frickin amazing!' an excited Locky gushes in a piece-to-camera. 'All the boxes are being ticked.' 

But while Bachelor Locky is thrilled about the new arrival, fellow suitor Izzy Sharman-Firth describes the newcomer as a 'kick in the d**k'.   

Last month, Daily Mail Australia published images of Bec at a rose ceremony following hometown week, which was filmed in July.

Five women were pictured on the grounds of the estate: Irena Srbinovska, Kaitlyn Hoppe, Bella Varelis, Izzy Sharman-Firth and Bec. 

Bella and Irena's place in the top five isn't surprising, as they've both been tipped as favourites since the season premiere.
