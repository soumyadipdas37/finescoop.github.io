Shoppers are going wild over an $87 instant hot water dispenser from Bunnings just a month after Kmart launched its sell out model that heats two litres in seconds.

The $87 gadget instantaneously dispenses 1.8 litres of hot water in just eight seconds without preheating - saving 20 per cent energy compared to a standard kettle.

Those who missed out on Kmart's $79 sold-out version are now heading to the hardware store's online store to get their hands on the product, which comes with a detachable water tank.

'So I missed out on the Kmart instant kettle so Bunnings to the rescue... definitely worth it. No more waiting for [water] to boil,' one woman wrote in a Facebook group.

The product is currently available to purchase online only, sold and delivered by KG Electronics, a 'Bunnings Trusted Seller'.

Many shoppers are raving about the instant hot water dispenser from Bunnings, with one woman declaring: 'We have this and love it.'

The product comes just one month after Kmart launched its $79 gadget that rapidly heats two litres of water in three to five seconds.

The gadget pumps out roughly 6ml of water per second and has a child-proof safety lock to prevent kids from turning it on.

Many people raged that they had just invested in new kettles and wished they had heard about the dispenser sooner.

'How did I not know about this? I only got a new kettle yesterday,' one woman complained.

Many said they had ordered the device after seeing positive reviews on Facebook.

One said: 'Reminds me of the hot water urns our mums used to have in the '70s, but a lot safer. Getting one.'
