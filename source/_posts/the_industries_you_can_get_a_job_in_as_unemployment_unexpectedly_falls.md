Unemployment is starting to fall, and with that comes a slew of new job opportunities as some sectors bounce back to life quicker than others. 

Online careers website Seek has released a list of the 20 most in-demand jobs in 2020, showing an increase in adverts for jobs for nurses, counsellors, parcel delivery and farm work.

Nursing is the most needed role, followed by warehousing and storage, aged and disability support, and automotive trades. 

It comes as more Australians get back into work, with the nation's unemployment rate falling from 7.5 per cent in July to 6.8 per cent in August.

Administration assistants, sales reps, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and rehabilitation are the next most in-demand industries.  

Also on Seek's list is childcare, chefs and cooks, retail assistants, labourers and programmers.  

Chief Economist at NAB Ivan Colhoun said some frontline workers in hospitals and aged care may be dropping out of the industry because of the strain of the pandemic.

Advertisements for warehouse, storage and distribution jobs have also increased since February due to an increase in online sales. 

'There was more online activity with many stores having to close their doors and increase their e-commerce focus,' Mr Colhoun told 7News. 

'That has a flow-on effect for logistics as well, as more people are needed for warehousing and then for home delivery.'

The number of Australians officially without work rose above the one million mark in July for the first time ever but in August, the ranks of the unemployed fell by 86,500 to 921,800 people. 

Victoria's unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent was above the national average, as the number of people employed fell by 42,400 as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions.

Of the big states, New South Wales had the lowest unemployment rate of 6.7 per cent.
