Conor Coady hailed his England debut as 'a dream come true', but admitted he was disappointed to have to settle for a draw with Denmark.

The Wolves defender looked assured on his first appearance for the senior side in the goalless draw in Copenhagen.

When asked by Sky Sports how proud he was of his debut, Coady said: 'Immensely, it is a dream come true. I said how much it means to me. There are some world-class players in this team, don't let anybody else tell you differently.

'It is 0-0, a clean sheet, we are happy with that, but disappointed we didn't come away with three points.

'I'm 27, I'm here to help England, these players and the team - that is the main goal, I don't care about my own performance as long as we win.'

Speaking after the game, former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher praised the Wolves defender.

He said: 'I love him. Not just because he came through Liverpool and I got to know him. You can’t help but like him. This was probably beyond his wildest dreams.'

Gary Neville added: 'He’s come through really well. He passed the ball well, led, kept a clean sheet and I think he will be happy that he’ll make the squad next month.'
