Jennifer Hawkins and her husband Jake Wall have reportedly purchased a renovation project in Whale Beach, just weeks after selling their $20million Sydney mansion.

According to The Daily Telegraph, the supermodel, 36, and her property developer husband Jake Wall, 37, purchased the 1950s home in Sydney's Northern Beaches for $6.95million.

The property, known as Rocca Bella, was previously owned by Dame Joan Sutherland and is the peninsula's largest oceanfront estate.

It was listed in 2018 for $8million but failed to sell and ­returned to the market earlier this year.

The spacious property is set on 3,100sqm of land with expansive ocean and coastal views.

Daily Mail Australia have contacted Jennifer Hawkins for comment.

In June, Jennifer and Jake finally sold their stunning mansion in Newport, Sydney, six months after listing it on the market.

According to Domain, the couple managed to find a buyer willing to meet their $20million asking price.

Jennifer and Jake had listed the palatial home for sale back in November, just weeks after they welcomed their first child, daughter Frankie Violet.

The former Miss Universe had hoped to move closer to her family in northern NSW, but her plans were put on hold after she and Jake struggled to find a buyer.

The property's listing agent, Ken Jacobs told The Daily Telegraph in April the COVID-19 restrictions had made it difficult for the couple to sell.

It's in a holding pattern of sorts,' Mr Jacobs told the publication.

He added: 'It's an issue of getting access. We would normally do inspections by appointment only anyway, but there is now the question of verifying with buyers where they have travelled.'
