A home baker has created decadent cronuts in an air fryer - topped with chocolate glaze, sprinkles, biscuit crumbs or crushed peanuts.

Instead of deep frying batter, the mother, from Sydney, used puff pastry sheets and cooking oil spray to create light, fluffy croissant-like doughnuts in her Kmart gadget.

To make the homemade desserts, the woman said she cut out nine rounds on one sheet of puff pastry using a cookie cutter.

Then she cut out the middle with a small cutter to create the doughnut ring. She lightly sprayed each base with cooking oil.

The woman said she then placed the bases in the air fryer at 180 degrees, and baked for eight to 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp.

In her final step, she drizzled chocolate or caramel over the doughnuts, along with an assortment of toppings including rainbow sprinkles, biscuit crumbs, crushed peanuts and desiccated coconut.

After sharing her easy-to-follow steps in a Facebook group dedicated to air fryers, hundreds were amazed at how 'simple' yet 'delicious' the doughnuts looked.

'Just thought the air fryer couldn't get any better. Off to buy puff pastry today after work,' one woman said.

Another added: 'Shut up and take my money.' 

Many said the recipe was 'great' for those who want to avoid eating deep fried desserts, while others said they couldn't wait to make it.

'This is great and I will definitely try this soon,' one said, while another added: 'Great idea! Thanks for sharing and will definitely try.'
