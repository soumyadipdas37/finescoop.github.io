She failed to find love with Matt Agnew on The Bachelor, and had a far-from-memorable fling with Ciarran Stott on Paradise. 

But it appears that's well and truly in Abbie Chatfield's past.

On Tuesday, the 25-year-old reality star couldn't wipe the smile off her face as she cosied up to a mystery man while enjoying lunch in a park in Brisbane.

Abbie, who has just completed two weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine after visiting Sydney, looked happy to be outdoors enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.

The influencer showed off her trim figure in a pair of leopard print tights and a matching crop top.  

Abbie wore her curly red locks up in a high bun and appeared makeup-free showing off her natural beauty.

Abbie and her companion chatted animatedly as they walked a large black dog around the park before picking up a bottle of water and coffees.

At one stage, she and her friend sat down on a bench and shared an intimate conversation before the redheaded stunner wrapped her arms around him and held him close.

The podcast host also kicked off her shoes to relax in the park, enjoying her newfound freedom.

Abbie also took some time to lay on the grass where she kept a close eye on her phone - no doubt keen to catch up with her friends after her time in quarantine.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Abbie for comment.  

During her lockdown, Abbie kept herself busy learning the raunchy WAP dance, based on Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's hit single.

Abbie rose to fame while dating Matt Agnew on The Bachelor in 2019. 

She made it to the final two, before the astrophysicist choose Chelsie McLeod. 

Abbie then starred on Bachelor in Paradise this year, where she set her sights on Ciarran Stott. 

The pair hooked-up, before Ciarran moved on to Jess Brody and, later, Kiki Morris.
