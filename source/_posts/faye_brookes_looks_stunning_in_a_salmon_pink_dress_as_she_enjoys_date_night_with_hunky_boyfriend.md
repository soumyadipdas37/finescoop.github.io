Faye Brookes and her personal trainer beau Joe Davies enjoyed a night out together on Thursday, still as loved up as ever.

The former Coronation Street actress, 32, turned heads in a shoulderless salmon pink dress, with a tulle fringe at the bust.

The figure-hugging number showed off her frame as she cosied up to Joe, who looked smart in a black and white floral shirt, a black trench, skinny black jeans and matching boots.

Standing tall in a pair of strappy heels, Faye accessorised with white gold jewelry, and a taupe leather handbag.

Wearing her mahogany locks in waves around her features, Manchester native Faye highlighted her natural good looks with a a rich palette of makeup. 

Their outing comes as Faye's ex-fiancé Gareth Gates, 36, is said to have found love with Ibiza DJ Chloe McLennan, having split from the actress last year.

Gareth celebrated his birthday last month with a group of family and friends, as well as with Chloe.

Posting a snap to Instagram, he added the caption: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'

He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.

A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'

Indeed, comments have materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth writing 'Mmmmm' under one of Chloe's sultry snaps.

 Faye confirmed her new romance with personal trainer Joe Davies in late November as they made their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night. 

During the night, the actress leaned into Joe as he placed a hand on the small of her back, indicating the friends had grown closer since Faye's relationship with Gareth ended last July. 

And earlier this month, the couple put on an affectionate display as they walked hand-in-hand towards The Ivy restaurant in Manchester before posing for pictures.  

In February, Gareth was linked to his panto co-star Hannah Grace Lawson, but this appeared to just be a friendship.

Romance: A source said, 'They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since' 

 The pair starred in Cinderella over the Christmas period at Nottingham's Theatre Royal for five weeks, when Hannah portrayed the titular character, while Gareth played Prince Charming.

Gareth was married to dancer Suzanne Mole – with whom he shares daughter Missy, 10 – from 2008 until 2012.

He met his Corrie star ex Faye when they featured in Legally Blonde: The Musical, and went public with their relationship in August 2013. 

In September 2018, it was reported Faye and Gareth briefly ended their relationship when the singer's 'very controlling' behaviour led to a series of furious rows.

But by November of that year, they had to give the relationship another try, with Faye pulling out of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! to spend time with him.

In a move that shocked fans, the singer asked her to marry him while they were on holiday in New York City on New Year's Eve 2018.   

Previously discussing the reason behind their first break-up, Gareth told OK!: 'There was a lot of strain on our relationship because I was always away with work and Faye's schedule was getting even busier so we decided we needed some breathing space.' 

During the proposal he performed a 17-minute song about their relationship before getting down on one knee to offer Faye a £30,000 engagement ring.

But by mid-July of last year, Faye reportedly moved out of their shared flat. They announced they had split for good in August.
