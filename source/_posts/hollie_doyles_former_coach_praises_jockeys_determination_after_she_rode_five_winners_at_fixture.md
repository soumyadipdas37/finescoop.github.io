John Reid, the man who coached Hollie Doyle in her early days as an apprentice jockey, says she has the ability to establish herself as a permanent fixture on the biggest stages in the sport.

Doyle, 23, became the first female jockey to ride five winners at a fixture with a glittering 889-1 five-timer at Windsor on Saturday and she completed a wonder weekend with a treble at Yarmouth yesterday on Global Esteem, Light Lily and Igotatext.

All eight wins were for different trainers.

Arc and Derby-winning jockey Reid said: 'Hollie is competing with the best riders in the world and she has shown she can do it. Wherever she goes she will hold her own.

'It's that determination which makes horses go. I have had some good kids but that is an ingredient which you can't put in if it is not there. You can't coach will to win but Hollie has it in bucket loads.'

Reid coached champion jockey Oisin Murphy and a champion apprentice in Jason Watson as well as top female jockeys Nicola Currie, Josephine Gordon and emerging talent Georgia Dobie.

The red-letter days for Doyle have been arriving at regular intervals and another is on the horizon at the weekend when Glen Shiel gives her a first ride in a British group one race in the Haydock Sprint Cup.

Last year Doyle set a new record for British female jockey with 116 wins, beating previous 106

Last year Doyle set a new record for British female jockey with 116 wins, beating the previous best of 106 set by Hayley Turner.

In June she became only the second female Flat jockey to win a race at Royal Ascot when Scarlet Dragon won the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes and last month she landed her first group win with Dame Malliot in the Group Two Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket.

Doyle has been handed increased opportunities by her association with trainer Archie Watson.

But significantly last month she was appointed retained jockey to Derby-winning owner Imad Al Sagar. The job gives Doyle access to better quality rides and openings in even bigger stables.

Al Sagar owns Extra Elusive, who won the Group Three Winter Hill Stakes on Saturday.
