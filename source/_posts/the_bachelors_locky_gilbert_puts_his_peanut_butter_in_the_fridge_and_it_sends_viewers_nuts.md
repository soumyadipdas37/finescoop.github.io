Locky Gilbert left viewers horrified when he put his peanut butter in the fridge during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor.

The 31-year-old Bachelor had been making peanut butter on toast when he put the opened jar into the fridge.

And fans of the show had plenty to say about it, complaining that the spread should only be stored in the pantry.

According to the Bega Peanut Butter FAQs page, peanut butter should be 'stored in the pantry right up until the best before date listed on pack'. 

'We wouldn't recommend keeping it in the fridge, as it makes it harder to spread,' they added. 

Meanwhile, other viewers were concerned about Locky's somewhat questionable decision to spread both butter and peanut butter onto his toast.
