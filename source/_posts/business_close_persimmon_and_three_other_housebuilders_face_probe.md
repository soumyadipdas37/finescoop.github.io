In company news today, four major housebuilders, namely Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey face action from the Competition and Markets Authority.

Buyers have argued that they were caught in a leasehold trap, with rising ground rents and unfair fees.

Elsewhere, embattled coffee chain Pret a Manger has launched a new subscription service to help boost sales. It will offer customers up to five coffees a day if they sign up to a monthly subscription service.

The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.88 per cent or 51.78 points to 5,799.08, while the US markets are also down again today.

Connor Campbell, an analyst at SpreadEx, said: 'A broadly better than expected jobs report out of the US wasn’t enough for the markets to shake their concerns this Friday.

'For the first time since the pandemic began, analysts’ nonfarm estimates were pretty much spot on. In August 1.371 million jobs were created, marginally down on the 1.375 expected. 

'A remarkable number for any time in history bar the one we are currently living through, and one that marks a notable slowdown on both July’s revised 1.734 million and June’s 4.791 million.

'There was good news elsewhere. Wage growth rose 0.4%, a huge improvement on the 0.0% forecast, while the unemployment rate sank to 8.4%, far better than the 9.8% expected. 

'It is worth noting that only a few months ago unemployment had been set to hit 19.4%'

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones is down 1 per cent or 282.54 points to 28,010.19.

Sound Energy slipped 11 per cent to 1p this week after the Moroccan authorities slapped a $14million tax bill in relation to a previous transfer of interest between two of its subsidiaries.

The firm said this assessment is based on a misunderstanding and is formally refuting it.

Just over two months ago, the junior upstream company raised £2.75million reaching a cash balance of £4.2million, at the time estimated to last until next March.

Britons ate more than 100 million meals last month as part of the Eat Out to Help Out discount scheme, the Treasury has said.

Initial figures have revealed that restaurant bookings surged as a result of the stimulus programme designed to boost the hospitality sector after it was hammered by the enforced closure of pubs, restaurants and cafes.

Diners received a state-backed 50 per cent discount on meals and soft drinks up to £10 each between Mondays and Wednesdays in August.

The final day of the scheme, Monday August 31, saw a 216 per cent jump in bookings compared to the equivalent day in 2019, according to initial data from OpenTable.

By the end of Monday, 130,000 claims were made by 84,700 restaurants signed up to the programme, with claims costing around £522million.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the programme as a 'success.'

Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, said: 'The employment data was very strong with more people working longer hours. 

'US employment growth looks in good shape with over a million more jobs created during the month of August and the momentum likely to have lasted beyond this report based upon the sharp decline in continuing jobless claims reported yesterday (unlikely to be captured by this survey).

'The fly in the ointment will be the resumed rise in permanent unemployment. Most of the change here is people on temporary layoffs but the permanent layoffs are creeping up again.

'The report is strong enough to challenge the Fed’s assessment of the jobs market. Now they’re prepared to allow inflation to overshoot it seems unlikely to their actual actions but jobs growth is better than they expected.  The bond market has reacted to that.'

Demand for new cars fell by 5.8 per cent in August as the market slipped back into decline, industry data shows.

The return to the red was described as 'disappointing' following July's 11 per cent surge in registrations as dealerships reopened and began to supply the pent-up demand from lockdown.

Registrations in the first eight months of 2020 are now back by a concerning 40 per cent with the trade body pinning its hopes on a bumper sales performance in September.

The airline has just confirmed it plans to trim its global workforce by a further 1,150 people. The job cuts will affect 'all functions.'

In a statement published just now, Virgin Atlantic said: 'Working closely with unions Unite and BALPA, a company-wide consultation period of 45 days begins today.'

It added: 'To mitigate as many cabin crew redundancies as possible, additionally, the airline is introducing a voluntary, Company-led and financed furlough scheme for an additional 600 crew when HM Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ends at the end of October.

'Should HM Government extend its Scheme, the airline intends to continue to benefit from it.'

Britain's competition watchdog is opening enforcement cases against four of the country's best known and biggest housebuilders over ground rents concerns and alleged mis-selling practices.

The practices of Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey are to be closely scrutinized by the Competition and Markets Authority in the coming months.

The watchdog said that some buyers of the housebuilders' homes may have been misled and been trapped into leaseholds with ground rents that double every decade.

David Vayro, head of built environment projects at law firm, Primas, said: 'Although growth in construction output continued in August, activity has fallen back slightly since July with commercial and civil engineering activity the weakest. 

'Data also shows that order books have not been filling across the piece as quickly as had been hoped. This is probably driven by client uncertainty looking into the Autumn with continued job-shedding, supply chain disruption and higher materials costs. 

'On a brighter note however, house building continues its strong rebound since March and – despite the current data - there is a positive expectation around the impact of forthcoming infrastructure projects and public sector construction spend.'

A wash of new research has found that Britons won't be ready to switch to an electric vehicle when the Government plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.

A nationwide survey by the UK's automotive trade body found that 44 per cent of motorists don't think they'll be ready to run a battery vehicle in 2035, many of them saying they can't see themselves ever owning one. 

Another study has asked Britons to name their performance demands from an electric car before they'd consider buying one, while a separate report focusing on the nation's charging infrastructure has found that the UK has just five per cent of the target number of public devices promised for the end of the decade.

Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club, said: 'All of the construction sectors saw weaker performance in August compared to July.

'House building growth was still robust as it grew at the second fastest rate (after July) since October 2014. 

'The housing market has seen a pick-up in activity since restrictions were increasingly lifted from May, further helped by the Chancellor temporarily raising the Stamp Duty threshold from mid-July – although uncertainties remain about the longer-term outlook.

'Commercial activity grew for a third month running, but was relatively modestly and below the rates seen in both July and June.

'Civil engineering activity saw renewed contraction in August after growing in July at the fastest rate since December 2018.'

The UK construction industry saw growth slow down in August as firms warned of a lack of new work.

The closely followed IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index hit a reading of 54.6 last month, compared to 58.1 in July.

Any reading above 50 represents an expansion in business activity.

Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: 'The latest PMI data signalled a setback for the UK construction sector as the speed of recovery lost momentum for the first time since the reopening phase began in May.'

Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club, said:'Further out, car manufacturers will be affected by the form the UK’s longer-term relationship with the EU will take. 

'In particular, car manufactures will be monitoring the possibility that the UK and EU might not reach a free trade arrangement by the end of the year when the transition arrangement ends.

'An issue for the car sector is that while the Government wants a free trade agreement with the EU that removes tariffs and quotas, it wants less regulatory alignment with the EU so the UK is able to diverge in rules and standards. 

'This could mean costs, new rules, and frictions at the border, which will affect businesses with integrated supply chains – notably the car sector.'

Demand for new cars fell by a 'disappointing' 5.8 per cent last month, industry data shows.

Some 87,226 new cars were registered in the UK in August compared with 92,573 during the same month in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

Registrations during the first eight months of the year are down 39.7 per cent compared with the same period in 2019.

SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: 'The decline is disappointing, following some brief optimism in July.'

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: 'Investors had a shock yesterday when a brutal sell-off in tech stocks caused a big wobble in global equities, with the tech-heavy US markets taking the worst hit. 

'The FTSE 100’s 1.5% decline was nothing compared to the Nasdaq’s 5% slump because the UK market has very little tech exposure.

'Friday saw the FTSE 100 barely move at 5,846 with investors still demonstrating an appetite for risk as the two sectors showing gains on the day were oil and mining. 

'The worst performing FTSE sectors were the defensives ones which you’d normally expect investors to snap up when markets go through a bad patch, namely utilities and healthcare.

'Other European markets were also static on Friday, while Asia saw just over 1% losses. These relatively minor movements would suggest that investors aren’t in panic mode and that Thursday’s sell-off might just have been people locking in some of the stellar gains made on tech stocks this year.

'However, there remains a fragile backdrop with mixed economic data, ongoing concerns about rising unemployment and no sign yet of a coronavirus vaccine, meaning that the slightest bit of bad news on any of these factors could be enough to cause further volatility in the markets.'

Construction of HS2 will formally start today with a 'shovels in the ground' moment.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the high-speed railway will create thousands of jobs and create vital links between urban areas.

HS2 Ltd, the Government-owned company building the scheme, would not disclose the location of today's event, but it is believed the Prime Minister will attend.

An official Government report has claimed the project could cost up to £100billion and end up being completed five years behind schedule.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 index is up 0.82 per cent 143.52 points to 17,603.21.

Neil Wilson, chief analyst at Markets.com, said: 'Ugly, ugly, ugly. 

'That could be the description of yesterday’s brutal sell off in tech stocks which led a broad market decline. 

'The selling in some of the big tech darlings yesterday was spectacular: Tesla –9%, Apple –8%, Microsoft –6%, Zoom –10%. The Nasdaq settled down -5% for the day but off its lows and it's only back to where it was last week, which simply shows what an extreme melt-up it’s been. The S&P 500 closed down -3.5%. Ugly is the only word.  

'Ugly is also the description of the general state of the economy and politics in the US and, arguably to a somewhat lesser extent, the U.K. 

'The US presidential battle is getting nasty as hell. We should have expected this - it will likely get much worse. But the implications for the market need serious consideration. 

'I worry there is an increasingly grave risk the election result is contested to a point where the concept of a smooth handover of power is tested - well beyond ‘hanging chads’. American democracy is in peril and this should worry us all.'

Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: 'The tech-inspired sell-off in the States overnight was mainly the result of a bout of healthy profit taking.

'Some disappointment following the ADP report earlier in the week was compounded by an uncomfortably high jobless claims number, while the service sector rebound also slowed in August. 

'Even so, the fact that there was no particular rush to haven assets suggests that some sort of rebalancing was overdue.

'Even after the overnight falls, the Dow Jones is down just 0.9% in the year to date, while the S&P500 remains comfortably ahead by 7%. 

'The turbocharged tech performers of 2020 bore the brunt of the selling pressure, with the likes of Apple down 8%, Tesla 9%, Microsoft 6% and Amazon 5%. 

'Despite these falls, the Nasdaq index remains on a tear, having risen by 28% in the year to date and by 73% since the March lows.'

Ryanair has raised 400 million euros from shareholders to strengthen its balance sheet as it eyes potential market opportunities in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The move adds to a large cash pile at an airline that has been less badly affected by the pandemic than many of its rivals owing to its relatively low level of debt and lack of exposure to the badly hit long-haul and business-class markets.

Ryanair issued 35,242,291 shares, about 3.2 per cent of its total share capital, at a price of 11.35 a share. That represents a discount of roughly 2.6 per cent to its closing price on Thursday.

Shares in Ryanair are currently up 2.7 per cent.

Pret A Manger has launched an in-store subscription service for customers to pay for the coffee they order each month as part of a major shift in the company’s model after being hit by dwindling commuter numbers.

The coffee and sandwich shop chain axed 2,800 roles last week after reporting that sales had been significantly hit by low footfall in city centres following the coronavirus pandemic.

It said is now launching the YourPret Barista service which will allow customers to buy up to five drinks each day for a month on a £20 monthly subscription.

The offer – which could add up to 150 drinks a month – will cover all barista-made coffees as well as teas, hot chocolates, smoothies and frappe drinks.

It said the subscription, which will officially launch on Tuesday 8 September, will be free to subscribers for the first month.

Mark Hayward, chief executive of NAEA Propertymark, said: 'It’s promising to see the CMA is taking enforcement action against four house builders on the grounds of mis-selling and unfair contract terms in relation to leasehold homes.

'The NAEA Propertymark Leasehold: A Life Sentence? report revealed three in five (62 per cent) leasehold property owners felt they were mis-sold and a further 93 per cent wouldn’t buy another leasehold property. 

'This means that for too long house builders and developers have not been transparent enough about what it means to buy a leasehold property, leaving many in financial difficulty as they have become trapped in confusing contracts with their freeholder.'

Four of the country’s biggest housebuilders could risk court action if they do not commit to changing the way they do business, after the competition watchdog found evidence they had mistreated leasehold buyers.

The Competition and Markets Authority said that it has written to Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey after uncovering 'troubling evidence of potentially unfair terms'.

The regulator said that buyers may have been misled by developers, and been trapped into leaseholds with ground rents that double every decade.

'It is unacceptable for housing developers to mislead or take advantage of homebuyers. That’s why we’ve launched today’s enforcement action,' said CMA boss Andrea Coscelli.

A freeholder owns both the house and the land it is on, while a leaseholder basically rents the property for a fixed period – sometimes centuries.

The watchdog said it was taking action over the mis-selling of leaseholds. It said that developers had not clearly explained what ground rent is and whether it increases over time to some buyers.

Following in the wake of US and Asian markets, the FTSE 100 is struggling this morning, falling nearly 1 per cent earlier. But, at the moment, the blue-chip index is down 0.2 per cent or 11.71 points to 5839.15.

The FTSE 250 index is currently down 5.73 points to 17,453.96.
