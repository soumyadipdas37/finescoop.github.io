Amanda Holden made a casual statement on Wednesday morning as she dressed down for a day of work at Heart Radio. 

The presenter, 49, donned a loose-fitting shacket and baggy trousers in a move that came after she denied suffering a wardrobe malfunction during Saturday's edition of Britain's Got Talent, which was met with over 200 Ofcom complaints.

She took to Instagram to shut down fans' claims that she 'flashed her nipples' in her navy thigh-slit gown, which was complete with a plunging neckline. 

Who's that girl? Amanda Holden made a casual statement on Wednesday morning as she dressed down for a day of work at Heart Radio

Amanda, who is typically seen in chic dresses at work, was barely-recognisable in the over-sized shirt-jacket with the loose-fitting trousers. 

She paired the look with heeled boots and clutched a small handbag for the trip. 

In her response to critics after BGT hit screens, Amanda, whose most recent appearance caused 235 viewers to contact the regulator, wrote: 'Mmmm really?! Who has nipples this close to their cleavage?!'  

Sharing the secret behind her bold look, the media personality added: 'FYI. A boned corset dented the girls all night', alongside a series of fried egg emojis.

According to a report from The Mirror on Monday, Ofcom received 277 complaints about the programme, with the majority focusing on the former Wild At Heart actress' ensemble.

Her gown featured a sweetheart neckline and was cinched around her svelte waist, teamed with a pair of sparkling silver barely-there heels.

In a snap shared to Instagram, the blonde showcased her toned pins in the chic outfit, which featured a perilously high thigh slit up the leg of the gown.

However at the time, some fans claimed Amanda had suffered a nip slip in the look, and they took to Twitter to question if they'd seen more than they'd bargained for during the show.

One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'

Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'

No problems here: She certainly didn't look bothered by the controversy 

Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?' 

MailOnline has contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment. 

This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show.

Amanda made an impression in thigh-skimming gown by Ziad Nakad, showing off a liberal amount of leg thanks to the asymmetric hemline.
