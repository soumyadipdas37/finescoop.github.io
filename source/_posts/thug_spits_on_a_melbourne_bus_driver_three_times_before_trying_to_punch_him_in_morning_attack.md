A manhunt continues for a passenger who repeatedly spat at a Melbourne bus driver after he attempted to assault him. 

The disgusting attack was captured on CCTV footage released by Victoria Police on Monday afternoon as they appealed for more details from the public.

The shocking incident occurred on the 246 bus route from Elsternwick to Clifton Hill in East Melbourne around 8.30am on August 25.

In the CCTV, the male passenger appears to angrily confront the driver as he leans over and squeezes his head through the metal protective screen separating them.

Victoria Police believe this man (pictured) may be able to assist with their inquiries 

He's captured trying to punch the driver.

Unable to reach him, the passenger leans to spit in the driver's face three times.  

The bus driver stopped near the intersection of Wellington Parade and Hoddle Street in East Melbourne and ordered the man to get off the bus.

The passenger was last seen running towards West Richmond train station.

The man is described as being of African descent and was wearing a black beanie and a black jacket with a red collar.

The CCTV was shared on the Victoria Police Facebook page, where shocked viewers expressed their disgust.

'I would have put my foot on the accelerator for just a second to make him go flying,' one woman commented.



The latest attack comes after another bus driver was allegedly spat on by a passenger in Brunswick on July 2. 

A young Melbourne woman, 20, was also allegedly assaulted by a fellow passenger in Melbourne's CBD in April after asking him to remove his feet from the seat.

Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
