A nurse has spent $100,000 on transforming herself into a 'plastic Barbie doll' - and she has no plans to stop until she achieves the 'perfect' body. 

Tara Jayne McConachy, from Melbourne, Australia, admitted she's 'addicted' to cosmetic surgery after getting five separate breast enhancement procedures, buttocks implants, a nose tip rhinoplasty, veneers, Botox and fillers.

'My most recent implant size is 1050cc,' she said. Breast implants usually start at 400cc and go up from there, with doses of 150cc to 200cc increasing a woman's bra size by up tp one cup.

The 31-year-old - who calls herself an 'upgraded limited edition Barbie doll' on social media - has travelled the world in search of the perfect 'fake sexy body'.

The 31-year-old has undergone multiple surgeries, including five separate breast enhancement procedures, buttocks implants, a nose tip rhinoplasty, veneers, Botox and filler

The qualified nurse said she was in Europe undergoing cosmetic surgery when the COVID-19 lockdown took hold in March.

'I had no time to recover properly as Australia was urging residents that were overseas to immediately return home as the borders were closing,' she said.

'Thank god I had my mum with me because I couldn't have done it without her.'

Tara is proud to say she'll stop at nothing to maintain and even enhance her 'knockout' 37-inch [bust], 17-inch [waist] - 29-inch [hips] figure.

'There is no limit for me when it comes to plastic surgery. It is incredibly addictive and I already want bigger breasts,' she said.

'As soon as travel is permitted, I have plans to go back overseas to visit my surgeon and get my breast size increased to 1500cc [from their current 1050ccc].'

Tara said her most striking feature is her lips adding they are 'definitely my statement'

Tara said she has lost count of how much product is inside her super plump, 'nice' lips 

Tara has also started her own page on adults-only subscription platform OnlyFans charging fans a fee to see her X-rated content

Tara said she's also looking at changing her eyes. 

'I'm exploring changing my eye colour to an even more vibrant green, plus fixing my eyelids with a canthoplasty, blepharoplasty and a brow lift,' she said.

'While I'm at it, I'll probably be getting cheek implants, a mini face lift and I'm even looking into the possibility of having ribs removed for a more tapered waist.

'Just the thought of this gets me all excited.'

Tara has started her own page on adults-only subscription platform OnlyFans charging fans a fee to see her X-rated content.

'So far it has been a very smart move,' she said.

'I made $10,000 in the first three days of making my account active.

'I love being able to get a little more personal with my fans and give them a behind the scenes tour of my life.

'And in future, I'm really looking forward to expanding and putting extra time into this venture.'

Tara won't take long to recoup all she's spend on acquiring her perfect figure.

'I don't know the exact amount I've spent on surgery, but it's easily in the vicinity of $100,000,' she said.

The most striking feature of Tara is probably her lips.

'My lips are definitely my statement,' she said.

'I always make sure they're nice and plump and get regular injections.

'I've definitely lost count of how much product is in there! I'm finally happy with how they look so now it's just all about maintenance.'

For Tara, she said the future is bright with more money, fans and cosmetic procedures on the horizon.

'I may be 31, but I feel like 21,' she said.

'I'm like a fine wine, I only get better with age. And, of course, surgery.'
