Two Australian journalists have been rushed back to Sydney from China amid urgent fears for their safety.

Bill Birtles from the ABC and Michael Smith from the Australian Financial Review landed in Sydney on Tuesday morning.

Mr Smith is based in Shanghai and is the China correspondent for the AFR while Mr Birtles has been in Beijing since 2015 working as the ABC's China correspondent.  

Their return follows the detention of Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, who Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed was being detained by Chinese authorities in late August.

The two journalists were told they were persons of interested into an investigation into Ms Lei and were told they could only leave China after submitting to a one-hour long interview, the AFR reported.

Bill Birtles for the ABC was questioned by Chinese authorities and told he was banned from leaving the country before arriving in Sydney on Tuesday morning

The pair flew back to Australia following intense questioning by China's Ministry of State security, the ABC reported. 

Mr Birtles was first warned to leave China last week by Australian diplomats and had booked flights for Thursday morning.

But upon throwing farewell drinks in his apartment on Wednesday night, seven police officers showed up at Mr Birtles' home and told him he was banned from leaving China.

The officers said he would be contacted the next day and would be questioned over a 'national security case'.   

He then spent the next four days staying in the Australian Embassy in Beijing as Chinese officials demanded an interview. 

Mr Birtles refused to speak to them but on Sunday agreed to be interviewed so his travel ban could be lifted.

The following morning he flew from Beijing to Shanghai and then back to Sydney. 

Mr Smith had also been questioned by Chinese officials who arrived at his home around 12.30am on Thursday.

He then sought refuge at the Australian consulate in Shanghai before returning to Sydney. 

'It's great to be back home safely after a difficult five days,' Mr Smith said on Tuesday.

'The late night visit by police at my home was intimidating and unnecessary and highlights the pressure all foreign journalists are under in China right now.' 

The departure of Mr Birtles and Mr Smith means there are currently no accredited Australian journalists in China. 

It comes after it was revealed Ms Lei, who has two children in Melbourne had been detained in China since August 14.

It is not known why Ms Lei, who is a high profile anchor for state broadcaster CGTN in Beijing, is being detained.  

Tensions between China and Australian have continued to grow in recent months after Scott Morrison's call for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.

The Australian government in July warned Australian citizens in China faced 'arbitrary detention' on the mainland. 

At the end of last month the Australian Government confirmed journalist Cheng Lei (pictured) was being detained in China. She is a high profile anchor for CGTN, China's English language state broadcaster

AFR editor-in-chief Michael Stutchbury and editor Paul Bailey released a statement about the 'disturbing' return of the two reporters. 

'We are glad Mike Smith, our correspondent who has been based in Shanghai for two and a half years, and Bill Birtles from the ABC, have made a safe return to Australia this morning,' they said.

'This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing and is not in the interests of a cooperative relationship between Australia and China.' 

Penny Wong, Opposition for foreign affairs said the reports were alarming. 

'I would just make a point that it is regrettable that news organisations, including the ABC, have had to make this decision,' she told ABC Radio Adelaide.

'The reports are deeply concerning, particularly some of the suggestions about what occurred prior to Mr Birtles leaving and Mr Smith leaving.'   

ABC News director Gaven Morris said they had followed government advice to bring Mr Birtles home. 

'This bureau is a vital part of the ABC's international newsgathering effort and we aim to get back there as soon as possible,' he said in a statement.
