Jadon Sancho provided a superb assist as Borussia Dortmund started their Bundesliga campaign with a 3-0 victory at home to Borussia Monchengladbach.

Sancho has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United, but a deal has so far failed to materialise.

While United struggled against Crystal Palace, Sancho showed them what they're missing with an excellent assist for Dortmund's second goal. He picked the ball up in his own half and burst forward before finding Haaland, who made it 3-0.

Giovanni Reyna had put Dortmund in front, with Haaland also scoring from the penalty spot before he doubled his tally having latched onto Sancho's pass.¬†
