Ant Anstead took to Instagram on Monday kindly asking people to take a step back from speculating on the reason for his split from Christina Anstead.

'This was a father son moment!' the 41-year-old TV personality said as he posed with their son Hudson, one. 'But due to some mean people I have turned comments OFF!'

He continued: 'While we both appreciate words of support, Please stop trying to diagnose from afar. It’s not fair.'

Moving forward: Ant Anstead, 41, took to Instagram on Monday kindly asking people to take a step back from speculating on the reason for his split from Christina Anstead, 37 

Anstead said that all parties involved remain in a good place amid the difficult time: 'Christina is fine. I am fine. And we remain good friends and will navigate this at our pace.'

The U.K. native wrapped up in saying that 'compassion and kindness is all that’s needed' amid the breakup with the Flip Or Flop beauty, 37.

The post came two days after Ant posted a picture of the pair, implying that the split came at Christina's request.

'Anyone who really knows me knows that I don’t like to share private matters publicly,' he said. 'I have remained silent while holding on to hope. I never gave up on us. I pray Christina’s decision brings her happiness.'

Update: Ant's post Monday came two days after Ant posted a picture of the pair, implying that the split came at Christina's request

Christina said that 'sometimes life throws us curve balls' amid the unexpected breakup

That post came amid a statement from Christina on her Instagram account, explaining her thoughts to her 1.5 million followers.

In the post, she explained how she initially wanted to be a sports agent but later developed an interest in real estate, later touching on the details of her personal life amid her recent split with Anstead, about four years after her parting with ex-husband El Moussa who she shares daughter Taylor, 10, and and son Brayden, five, with.

'I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two,' Christina said. 'I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies - but sometimes life throws us curve balls.

Christina's ex Tarek El Moussa, 39, took to Instagram earlier this month with an optimistic post about achieving life goals days as he sat with his fiancée Heather Rae Young, 33 

Out and about: Christina was snapped late last year in Newport Beach, California 

She continued: 'Instead of getting stuck in these "setbacks" I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow. So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me.

'And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I’m messy, I’m real and I’m working on healing.' 

An insider previously told Us Weekly that the pair had 'been very private about this and friends are shocked to hear the news because they seemed happy together publicly and while in front of others.'

Tarek El Moussa and Christina said they were separating in December 2016, and their divorce was finalized more than a year later in early 2018. Anstead, of Wheeler Dealers fame, and Christina first began seeing one another in October of 2017.

Christina announced their separation September 18, saying, 'Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate. 'We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority. We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future.'

The couple had exchanged vows at the home they shared in Newport Beach in December of 2018. Anstead is father to teen Amelie, 16, and Archie, 14, from his previous marriage to Louise Herbert.
