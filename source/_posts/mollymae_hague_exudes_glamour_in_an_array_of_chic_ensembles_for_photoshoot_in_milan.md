She recently revealed that she'd been harassed by a group of men while out shopping in Manchester.

One striking look saw Molly-Mae highlight her peachy derriere in a pair of leather trousers teamed with a billowing white blouse.

'This is why I just cannot vlog in public guys, listen to this,' she said, as a man shouted 'oi blondie' in the background.

When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae, who has been dating Tommy for one year, said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.'

The blonde also answered the question: 'If you could meet Tommy again without the fame, would you?'

She replied: 'Well this is the nice thing about how we met, we met on Love Island and I didn't know who he was, he didn't know who I was. It was a really natural and nice way of meeting.'
