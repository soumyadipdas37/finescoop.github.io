This is the adorable moment a kitten gave a manicurist a helping paw with filing a customer's nails.

Four-month-old curious cat Mau 'helped' her owner Liana Nicolae by grabbing hold of the nail file while she tried to smooth a decorative nail.

In the footage, recorded in Liana's native Romania, Mau grabs hold of the nail file with both paws and helps by dragging it backwards and forwards.

As if admiring its own work, the kitten lets go of the file at one point and looks down on the nails as Liana continues her work.

Seeing Liana carrying on filing the nails, Mau grabs hold of the file again with one paw and carries on helping her owner.

Both Liana and her model can be heard laughing throughout the clip.

The kitten spends almost a minute trying to help its owner finish filing the model's nails.

At the end of the video Mau earns a scratch on the back from the model after putting in a hard graft with the filing. 

Liana had been crafting the decorative nails on a model as practice for a competition when Mau decided to help out.

The video was posted on Facebook by Liana with the comment 'I found help'.
