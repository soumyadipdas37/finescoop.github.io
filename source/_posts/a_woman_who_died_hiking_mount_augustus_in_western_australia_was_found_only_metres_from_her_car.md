A woman died just metres from her car after trying to save her sick partner who suffered a medical episode climbing the 'world's largest rock'.

The 53-year-old was found dead at the base of Mount Augustus on Monday afternoon, about 1,000km north of Perth in Western Australia.

She had set off on a mission to reach the summit of the peak with her partner at around midday but when he fell ill they were forced to turn around.

But it was her body that was discovered while her partner - who was found a short walk away - miraculously survived after being rushed to Carnarvan Hospital for treatment.

He was later flown to Perth for further medical attention.

An anonymous source said she thought the woman's efforts to save her 'very, very sick' partner may have been her downfall. 

'I think she may have been helping him down, and that would have worn her down a lot and she collapsed,' she told The West Australian.    

The pair had filled out a trip intention form which suggested they were due to arrive at Cattle Pool at 6.30pm that day.

While they hadn't flagged their departure time, a six hour hike on the trail would put their estimated starting time at around 12pm. 

The woman said a decision to leave at this time was unwise.  

'And that's unfortunately very late in the day. Far too late. We try to drum into people they need to leave early in the morning and get back before lunch time, before the heat of the day hits,' she said. 

'I think a lot of people sadly don't really realise how hard this climb is. How hot it gets up there — well above 35C most days, and the rock radiates heat. And they're coming from Perth where it's a lot colder, so they're just not prepared.' 

The woman's death was the first of three deaths on the trail of the remote outback mountain in the past three days. 

A man in his 70s and a woman in their 60s were found dead a 45-minute walk from the parking area, at around 7.30am on Wednesday.

A 69-year-old German tourist died along the same trail last November. 

Mount Augustus is a very remote area of Western Australia where temperatures at this time of year are in the high 30s to 40s during the day.

The peak is also considered the world's largest rock at 1100m high and 8km long. 

The mountain's remote location and soaring temperatures mean hiking can be particularly treacherous for people who are unprepared or inexperienced.

WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said the decision to block off Uluru for climbing has resulted in more inexperienced hikers turning to Mount Augustus.
