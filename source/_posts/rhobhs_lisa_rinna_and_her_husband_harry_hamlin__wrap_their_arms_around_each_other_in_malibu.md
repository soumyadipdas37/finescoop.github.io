Lisa Rinna and her husband Harry Hamlin looked happy in love as they strolled with their arms around each other after enjoying a meal at an Italian eatery in Malibu. 

After hitting the Tra Di Noi on Saturday, the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star, 57, and three-time Golden Globe nominee, 68, were practically joined at the hip. 

As the couple soaked in some quality time, the Melrose Place actress showcased her trim figure in a tiny black tank top, which she went braless underneath.

She paired her look with a pair of form-fitting black leggings, a matching baseball cap and neon pink sneakers. 

Meanwhile, the L.A. Law actor lovingly draped his arm around Rinna's shoulders. 

While he opted for a standard blue surgical mask, the mother-of-two donned a leopard print face and her classic aviator sunglasses.

The spouses, who married in 1997, share two daughters Amelia Gray, 19, and Delilah Belle, 22.  

Harry is also father to son Dimitri Alexander, 40, whom he shares with original Bond girl Ursula Andress, now 84. 

At the time of the breakup, the Swiss actress told People, 'I want to be with him, but he wants to go out. Love affairs and husbands can end, but a child is forever. Dimitri is my love now.'

Harry spoke about his relationship with his son, who is a male model and DJ, in a 2019 interview with the Daily Beast.

'I didn’t grow up with my son, Dimitri,' said the actor. His eldest child was largely raised in Rome, by his mother.

'Any son who doesn’t grow up with his father has issues. You can’t grow up without having a dad and not have that affect your life.'

Apart from his relationship with Andress, to whom he was never wed, Hamlin has been married three times: to Laura Johnson, Nicollette Sheridan and Rinna.

The father-of-three boasted to the outlet he has his 'divorce lawyer on speed dial.'

'I have had three opportunities to use him; once with Ursula, and two of my ex-wives. It’s the same guy every time. We send Christmas cards to each other every year.'
