The five-year-old boy (pictured) was allegedly beaten to within an inch of his life

A mother whose young son was allegedly beaten within an inch of his life has been hit with additional charges.

Police found the five-year-old boy at his mother's alleged 'house of horrors'  in Cabramatta, Sydney, at 9.50pm on Friday, August 28. 

He was covered in bruises from 'head to toe' following the savage beating allegedly doled out by the boyfriend, a Vietnamese student. 

Emergency crews rushed him to Liverpool Hospital in a critical condition before he was transferred to the Children’s Hospital at Westmead.

The boy remains in hospital in a stable condition.

Both the boy's mother, 31, and her lover, 20, were arrested and charged over the incident. 

The man, a student originally from Vietnam, was charged with wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

The mother was charged with failing to care for the boy.

On Wednesday, she was also charged with wounding a person to intend to cause grievous bodily harm.

The boy has woken up in hospital and his dad (above, on his second birthday) is by his bedside. 'I couldn't imagine how (the father) would be if he lost him'

She remains on remand and is due to appear at Liverpool Local Court on Wednesday.

Daily Mail Australia understands police will allege the boy was struck in the head with a stick or wooden pole during the alleged ordeal. 

A court has heard that the child had reportedly suffered a brain injury and had splinters throughout his body. 

The boy was in placed on life support and was in a critical condition. 

It was five days before he came around.

But relatives are understood to be worried about the boy suffering lasting trauma as well as the ongoing effects of his head injuries. He remains in hospital. 

The boy's father and mother have been estranged for some time, with both moving on with new partners in the past two years.

'I miss and love you so much', the father captioned a picture of his son on Facebook in 2018, after his relationship with the mother fizzled.   

Meanwhile, the boy's mother presented herself to friends as a doting parent who lavished her son with toys.

She described the child as her 'prince' on Facebook and said she hoped he grew up to be 'obedient and smart.' 

'You are all of my life,' she said.
