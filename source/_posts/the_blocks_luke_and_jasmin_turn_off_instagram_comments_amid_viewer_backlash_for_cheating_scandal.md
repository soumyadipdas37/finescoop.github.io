The Block's Luke and Jasmin have been bombarded with trolling and cruel taunts from viewers amid their 'cheating scandal' on the renovation show.

Despite telling invested fans that they did not intentionally 'cheat', the explosive 'copygate' saga continues to attract backlash online.

As of Wednesday, the team from Western Australia implemented a limit on all comments made on their Instagram profile to avoid further abuse.

Damage control: The Block's Luke and Jasmin have turned off Instagram comments amid viewer backlash for 'cheating scandal' involving their winning children's bedroom

By disabling public comments, only users they actively follow and are 'friends' with are allowed to interact with them in their posts' comment section. 

While the pair have blocked negativity and potential trolling on their own page, The Block's official instagram account is still receiving frustrated comments from fans unhappy with Luke and Jasmin's 'cheating' and 'copying'.    

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Nine for comment.

'We believed it was all above board': Luke and Jasmin first tried to reason with fans on Tuesday, by vehemently denying plagiarising and insisting they did not knowingly break the rules

Luke and Jasmin first tried to reason with fans on Tuesday, by vehemently denying plagiarising their winning children's bedroom and insisting they did not knowingly break the rules.  

The couple were accused by judge Shaynna Blaze of creating a 'carbon copy' of another design they were using as 'inspiration'.  

'All week we were showing our mood board which featured the room from the The Designory (and other images). We were open about using it and believed it was all above board,' they explained.

'Inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another,' Block judge Shaynna Blaze (pictured) told Luke and Jasmin

Speaking out: In a lengthy post to Instagram, the interior design guru defended her remarks about the couple's room being plagiarised, but did acknowledge the possibility they had copied their room without even realising it

Shaynna said she had no choice but to 'have a difficult conversation' with Luke and Jasmin after noticing the 'many similarities' between their renovation and the Barefoot Escapes holiday home in Byron Bay designed by The Designory agency. 

She shared her own statement to Instagram on Tuesday in which she urged viewers to stop trolling the couple, and Jasmin in particular. 

While the interior design guru defended her remarks about the couple's room being plagiarised, she did acknowledge the possibility they had copied their room without even realising it.

'Please don't direct any negativity towards Jasmin on social media, and instead let's all take a look at our own appreciation of design and other designers, and our personal understanding of the difference between imitation and plagiarism,' she concluded.

Support: Judge Shaynna also urged viewers to stop trolling the couple, and Jasmin in particular, hours after Tuesday night's episode

The Block's Luke and Jasmin find themselves at the centre of yet another cheating scandal in a teaser trailer for Sunday's upcoming episode.

Fellow contestants Daniel and Jade enlisted furniture designer Christian Cole to create a bespoke kitchen island bench for them, in which they claim Luke and Jasmin later copied the design.

Foreman Keith Schleiger pointed out the similarities between the two teams' island benches, and made no secret of the fact Luke and Jasmin had tried to recreate Daniel and Jade's one-of-a-kind design.

Stay tuned! The Block continues on Sunday from 7pm on Channel Nine
