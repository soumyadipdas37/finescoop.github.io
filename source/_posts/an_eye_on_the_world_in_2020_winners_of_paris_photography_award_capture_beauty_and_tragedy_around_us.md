The winners of the prestigious Paris Photography Award have captured the beauty and tragedy around use from a feeding whale in Mexico to the frenzy of a coronavirus ward.

The Photographer of the Year Award was presented to Alberto Giuliani whose series of portraits titled, 'San Salvatore,' captured front line medics during hellish shifts at the San Salvatore Hospital in Pesaro, Italy.

'I photographed them at the end of their shifts—twelve hours without a break during their fight in an unequal war. In the deep imprints left by their protective masks, I found a symbol of their sacrifice, but above all, I found evidence of the pain, fear and helplessness of standing before an unknown enemy.' Giuliani said.

Other images captured the stunning power of nature; from thundering torrents at Victoria Falls in Africa, to the shimmering ice caves of Iceland and the magnificent valleys of Ethiopia through which ancient prayers echo. 

Many of the shortlisted photographs were of majestic beasts, such as a 3,000-stone whale shark inhaling fish eggs off the coast of Mexico and elephants in Africa.

Italian photographer, Alberto Giuliani, was awarded the coveted prize of Photographer of the Year. His series of photographs, titled 'San Salvatore' featured Italian medical workers wearing full PPE and with impressions left by face masks on their faces during hellish shifts on coronavirus wards at the height of the pandemic

Palmer said: 'The Hluhluwe Imfolozi park is the oldest game reserve in Africa and is also the birthplace of rhino conservation and is the reason the white rhino can still be found in high numbers today! Sightings in the park and in Zululand are not uncommon but typically photos are very similar i.e. they are either eating or sleeping. On this occasion the mother took her young calf, ran out on the road in front of us zig-zagged towards the car and disappeared in the bushes! I have been on many safaris and seen and photographed many rhinos but I will never have another image like this in my lifetime'
