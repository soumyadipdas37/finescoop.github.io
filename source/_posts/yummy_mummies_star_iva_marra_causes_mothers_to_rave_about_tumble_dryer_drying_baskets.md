Mothers are raving about 'drying baskets' which can be slotted into tumble dryers to gently spin shoes, toys and delicate clothing without causing damage.

The racks clip to the back of the tumbler to keep items flat and secure while it rotates, slowly drying them from the heat in the air rather than spinning loose and knocking against the machine.

A discussion about the baskets - which can be found on the 'accessories' tab of leading appliance websites - began when Melbourne TV personality Iva Marra posted a photo of her $99 Miele insert in a cleaning group on Facebook.

'I seriously love my Miele. You can get this dryer rack to dry things gently!' Ms Marra, who stars in Netflix reality series Yummy Mummies, wrote in the caption.

The post drew delighted responses after it was shared on Tuesday, with hundreds of comments including 'this is awesome', 'high tech wizardry' and 'I learned something new today'. 

'I didn't even know you could put shoes in the dryer let alone ON A FREAKING DRYER RACK! I need to invest stat!' one woman replied. 

A second said 'I didn't know this was a thing, super cool!' while a third added: 'Witchcraft!!!! This... Is.... Amazing! I didn't even know this existed!'

But despite the widespread amazement, some said they've known about the baskets for years.

'My mum's 20 year old LG [tumble dryer] has that?' one woman wrote.

Another said she thought 'all dryers had a drying rack'.

Those comments caused dozens to jump to Ms Marra's defence, with one person declaring: 'I've never seen this before, ever!' 

'My dryer is about five years old and doesn't have this feature so I was amazed by the post,' said another.

A third said: 'My 20 year old dryer doesn't have one. I feel ripped off!'

Ms Marra, who shares daughter Milana and son Stephan with husband Steven, hit back at critics saying: 'OMG everyone saying 'my 20 year old dry has that' like calm down, I just discovered this and obviously I've been living under a rock!'
