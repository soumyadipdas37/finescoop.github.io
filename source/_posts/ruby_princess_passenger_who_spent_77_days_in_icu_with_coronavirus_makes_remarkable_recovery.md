An elderly man who contracted COVID-19 on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship has made a stunning recovery after spending 77 days in ICU.  

The 81-year-old, whose name has been given only as Richard, bravely battled the deadly disease at the Gold Coast University Hospital in Queensland, spending three months from March to June on and off a ventilator.

For the past couple of months he's been out of critical care and will next week be moved into a rehabilitation unit to begin the final phase of his recovery, Queensland's Health Minister Steven Miles said.

'I want to make special mention today of Richard,' Mr Miles said on Friday.

'He knows better than anyone just how awful this disease can be, how great our hospital services are at saving lives from COVID but also how long it can take to recover.'

Although Richard spent more time in ICU battling coronavirus than any other patient in Queensland, a NSW woman holds the unenviable Australian record. 

Former opera singer Arnela Regaliza spend 107 days in Sydney's Westmead Hospital's ICU after becoming infected with COVID-19 on a return flight from the Philippines in early March. 

At one point during her stay, she was clinically dead for 12 minutes. 

The ill-fated voyage of Carnival Corporation's Ruby Princess cruise ship has been linked to more than 660 COVID-19 cases and 28 deaths, including eight in the U.S.

Over 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark on March 19 in Sydney after botched health screenings.

Last month, a scathing report into the public health blunder launched in April, described the failings of state government as 'inexcusable' and 'inexplicable'.

The investigation led by barrister Bret Walker concluded that all passengers should have been tested for coronavirus and ordered to undergo a mandatory period of quarantine.

But health officials deemed the ship 'low risk' and gave the okay for passengers to travel freely into the community. 

The state of Queensland recorded only two new infections of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,145.

'Both of them were in quarantine and were known to be direct contacts of already confirmed cases,' Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.

'One of them, the seventh member of a household, all who now have had COVID-19 but who were in quarantine and the other a confirmed community contact of a case.'

There are now 28 cases in the state which remain active, with 10 patients are being treated in hospital.  

The state's coronvirus death toll stands at six.
