They recently announced they had not only married but were expecting their first child together after nine months of dating. 

And on Sunday Brianne Delcourt revealed just how far along she is in a sweet family photo album posted on her husband Kevin Kilbane's Instagram.

The Dancing on Ice professional, 39, donned comfy grey sweatpants and a big blue sweatshirt for the snap as she reached the halfway point of her pregnancy.

Burgeoning bump: Brianne Delcourt displays her blossoming baby bump in a candid snap as she reached the 20th week of her pregnancy 

Brianne clutched her burgeoning bump and looked intensely onto the camera, as she stood in the garden of the couple's summer cottage. 

A second snap shows the Canadian skater seated on a chair while her daughter from a previous relationship Gracie plays with her toys and a rough collie dog stands by. 

A third snap shows Gracie cheekily holding a collection of home-baked biscuits that appear to have merged together in the oven. 

Bursting with familial pride, Kevin captioned the post: 'Totally in awe of this stunner especially as she carries our baby. 

Don't look at me: A second snap showed Gracie, her daughter from a previous relationship, playing with a rough collie dog 

Sweet: In the caption Kevin said he's 'in awe' of his expectant wife as they await the birth of their first child together in 2021

Uh oh: Gracie's cookies appeared to have bled into each other in the oven - but she didn't seem to mind too much

'Can’t wait for the new arrival to add to our beautiful family..... Great weekend as we say goodbye to the summer cottage and wait for the winter arrival!!!! 

'So Loved the cookies baked by my beautiful girl. I Love you @brianne_tv ❤️ #20weekspregnant'.

Kevin and Brianne met in October 2019 when they were partnered on the ITV skating show.

They have been in a relationship since December, and they tied the knot earlier in September in Canada.

Kevin, 42, told OK! magazine: 'Everything may seem fast in other people’s eyes and we can’t believe it ourselves but we do everything together so this was naturally the next step.' 

Discussing their ceremony, which took place at Bonnie View Inn in Haliburton, Ontario, Brianne noted: 'When I look back now I realise it worked out perfectly. It was intimate and just about Kevin and I.'

Due to Covid travelling restrictions, the couple were unable to have any guests with them from the UK, so their nuptials were attended only by Gracie, Brianne's immediate family, and two friends.

Yet the pair still had an incredible day, with Brianne gushing: 'It was amazing. Of course we had Gracie with us, but to also have our baby in my stomach took it to a complete other level. The baby kicked as we said "I do".'

The pair are now planning to have a lavish wedding ceremony in Ireland next year that can be attended by all their friends and family.

Family first: Brianne has also been showing her bump on her own Instagram. She is pictured here with her Canadian mother
