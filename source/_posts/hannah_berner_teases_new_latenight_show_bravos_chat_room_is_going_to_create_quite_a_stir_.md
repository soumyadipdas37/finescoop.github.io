The show is hosted by Housewives Gizelle Bryant and Porsha Williams, Below Deck's Kate Chastain along with Berner.

'I feel like it was kind of like Charlie's Angels where Andy had a vision and he wanted to put together four strong, loud, opinionated women,' Hannah said. 

The fabulous foursome will join forces to cover trends, culture and the latest headlines, from parenting and television to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Of course, Bravo's Chat Room will also dive deep into the network'vs own shows and Bravolebrities with the unique perspective of their own experiences. 

'I'm excited that we are going to talk a lot about Bravo shows but in a different way than just people observing because we've experienced it ourselves,' the comedy star said.

'To be talking about Housewives with Housewives is just gonna be insane for me,' she added. 'I'm so excited cause I'm a Bravo fan - just three years ago I got on Bravo so this [all] seems like a dream.'

Since the four hosts are coming together from different areas of the country, they will all film remotely from their own homes.

'I think together we're going to create quite a stir,' Hannah said. 

Along with Andy Cohen, co-hosts Kate, and Porsha are also serving as executive producers on the series.  

 'I am thrilled for these Bravo ladies who already have such big personalities on our network to come together (virtually) for the ultimate group chat,' Andy Cohen said when announcing the series.

'Their quick wit and powerful observations will provide a much-needed voice in today's pop-culture landscape delivered in a way that only Bravo can.'

Meanwhile, fans are clamoring for a new season of Summer House and Hannah has some good news on that front. 

Back in the spring, the reality series wrapped season four and thanks to diligently sticking to COVID-19 safety protocols, new episodes are on the way.

'There is a new season coming,' Hannah teased. Berner praised the network for making the health and safety of the cast and crew 'top priority' amid the pandemic.

'I just feel so fortunate that Bravo was able to even orchestrate this,' she said. Adding that filming has already completed and safety guidelines were followed to the letter.

As for Hannah's status with Summer House's Luke Gulbranson revealed that she actually has a new man and fans won't have to wait long to hear more.

'You're going to get a lot of details on it,' she promised, adding that she'll spill the tea in the very first episode of Bravo's Chat Room.
