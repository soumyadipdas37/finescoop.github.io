Leicester and West Ham are poised to revive their interest in Djene Dakonam with Getafe ready to slash the asking price for their Togo centre-half.

Djene could be available for as little as £10million after helping his team finish eighth in La Liga last season.

Premier League clubs, including Tottenham and Arsenal, have charted his progress since he moved to Spain from Belgium in 2017, but have always been deterred by a buy-out clause set at more than £36m.

Djene Dakonam has been linked with a move to Premier League sides Leicester and West Ham

The Togo international was previously linked with moves to Tottenham and Arsenal 

After the impact of the pandemic and having missed out on European football, Getafe are searching to generate funds in this transfer window.

They have agreed to listen to offers and accept the 28-year-old wants to move on to a new challenge.

Djene, who can also operate at right-back, would prefer a move to England.

Leicester and West Ham were among those who made enquiries last summer only to be put off by the cost.
