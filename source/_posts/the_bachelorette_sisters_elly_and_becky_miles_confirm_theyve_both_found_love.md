Sisters Elly and Becky Miles have wrapped filming their season of The Bachelorette.

And the siblings are happy to confirm they've both found love, and are still dating their separate 'winners'.

Elly, 26, and Becky, 30, told Who Magazine on Thursday that they were prepared for one sister to leave the show without a partner, but were pleasantly surprised to have both found love.

Elly's appearance on The Bachelorette with her older sister comes after she failed to find love with astrophysicist Matt Agnew on The Bachelor last year.

'Yes we have [both found love]. I'm so happy right now for myself and for Bec. Her guy is the best, I love him - for her,' Elly said.

Elly claimed that she hoped her sister would find someone on the show, as she has been though 'a lot of hardship in relationships and people being crap to her'.

Becky also told the publication that Elly allowed herself to be more vulnerable during this season, and was glad it paid off for her.  

As for fighting over the same guy in the pool of men available to them in the mansion, Elly gave one major reason why that was never going to be on the cards.

'There was no chance we'd fall for the same guy, because we both have very different taste when it comes to men. Anyone Becky is interested in, I automatically put them in the brother basket,' she said, while Bec agreed 'that would be weird'.

In trailers for their red carpet debut with the mansion full of hunks, some of the men were confused at the prospect of two Bachelorettes.

When Elly clarified 'two girls, looking for one guy... each', Brisbane-based Ab Sow let out a sigh of relief, and said: 'oh, phew, I was going to say!'  

The Bachelorette premieres Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
