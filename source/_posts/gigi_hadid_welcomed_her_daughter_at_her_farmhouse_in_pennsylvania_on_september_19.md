New mother Gigi Hadid reportedly welcomed her first child at the New Hope farmhouse in Pennsylvania that her babydaddy, former 1D boybander Zayn Malik, purchased back in 2017.

The 25-year-old IMG Model and the 27-year-old singer 'had been isolating on the farm since May' and 'the birth date of their newborn daughter was September 19' - according to Page Six.

Zayn bought the farm on the urging of Gigi's mother Yolanda - who owns a $4M, 32-acre 240-year-old farmhouse nearby housing horses, mini-horses, goats, chickens, sheep, and Scottish highland cattle.

'There's not a lot of things around. I do a lot of farm work,' Malik told Billboard back in 2017.

'I take the horses out and feed the cows and that kind of stuff. It's cool. I've always been interested in animals.'

Hadid has been Instastorying the many baby gifts she's received from designer Donatella Versace, pop star Taylor Swift, and painter Austyn Weiner.
