A West Australian police officer who fatally shot a knife-wielding man acted appropriately under the circumstances, a coroner has found.

Hayden Paul Stacey, 22, was shot in the chest by probationary constable Lucinda Boon after he advanced on her and another officer with a large kitchen knife in Wannanup, south of Perth, in May 2018.

Police had repeatedly called on an agitated Mr Stacey to drop the weapon and unsuccessfully tried to subdue him with their Tasers.

Hayden Paul Stacey, 22, was shot in the chest by probationary constable Lucinda Boon after he advanced on her and another officer with a large kitchen knife in Wannanup, south of Perth, in May 2018

In findings published on Monday, coroner Michael Jenkin said Constable Boon had no option but to shoot Mr Stacey given the risk of being stabbed.

'Having carefully considered the available evidence, I am satisfied that the officers conducted themselves reasonably when they interacted with Mr Stacey,' the coroner said.

He made just one recommendation, finding that police should take all necessary steps to introduce new Tasers with greater potential to incapacitate offenders.

Mr Stacey had been wearing baggy clothing which may have prevented the Taser probes from making contact with his skin, the court heard.

He was spotted by the officers who were responding to two reports of a suspicious person - one of which, the court heard, was made by Mr Stacey himself.

Sergeant Harry Russell said Mr Stacey was carrying a multi-tool knife, telling the officers: 'I brought the knife down so I can get a gun to shoot myself'.

After Mr Stacey ignored multiple demands to drop the knife, the constable drew her Taser.

He eventually complied but then produced a 30cm kitchen knife and started to move towards the officers.

Mr Stacey was tasered three times but it didn't appear to affect him, making the sergeant believe he must have been wearing armour.

Holding his knife above his head saying 'do your job, come on then', he lunged at Constable Boon, who had warned she would shoot him if he didn't drop the weapon.

He was shot in the chest from three metres away and died in hospital shortly afterwards.

The court heard Stacey had been unable to find work and experimented with drugs including methamphetamine since being imprisoned in 2014, and had alcohol and cannabis in his system when he was shot.

But the coroner said he had been unable to conclude whether Mr Stacey was actively suicidal or had intended to force officers to shoot him.

A WA Police internal affairs unit investigation concluded the officers did not use excessive force so they were not subject to any sanctions.
