Tess Daly has announced she's stepping down as the host of Children In Need after 11 years.

The Strictly Come Dancing presenter, 51, took to Instagram to share the sad news with fans, as the annual telethon reaches its 40th Anniversary in November.

Paying tribute to the charity's founder Sir Terry Wogan with a series of snaps, Tess ensured fans that Pudsey 'would always hold a special place in her heart.

Tess shared a lengthy post with her fans as she documented her time as host of Children In Need.

Among them were a snap with Terry and Ade Adepitan, who has hosted the show since 2016.

She wrote: 'For the past 11 years I've had the great privilege of presenting Children In Need alongside brilliant presenters and an amazing team.

'Pudsey and what he represents will always hold a special place in my heart but it's time to pass the presenting baton over as the show reaches it's amazing 40-year milestone. 

'That's four decades of the British public donating and heroically fundraising over £1bn towards changing children's lives for the better. 

'But Children In Need isn't just an annual event, it works tirelessly all year round and I'm excited that I will continue to work alongside some of the vitally important projects that this extraordinary charity supports, seeing first-hand what a profound affect these unprecedented times have had, and to find out what more we can do to help.'

Moving on: In the post Tess shared several snaps from her time on Children In Need, including one with co-host Ade Adepitan

Tess joined the Children In Need team in 2008 when she hosted alongside Terry and Fearne Cotton.

Following Terry's death in 2016 she has joined forces with a slew of different presenters, including Rochelle and Marvin Humes, Graham Norton and Tom Allen.

Of course Tess will be reuniting with Claudia Winkleman for the new series of Strictly Come Dancing this October, which has been shortened due to changes introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lineup was confirmed last week, and will feature stars such as actress Caroline Quentin, Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing and The Wanted's Max George.
