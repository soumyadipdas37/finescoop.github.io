It was one of the worst kept secrets in Australian reality TV.

But despite the results of The Bachelor leaking early into the season, Locky Gilbert and winner Irena Srbinovska still had to follow strict rules to maintain an air of secrecy before the finale.

In a new interview with Who magazine, the happy couple revealed the codenames they used to communicate with each other while the show was airing.

'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky admitted, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.

'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.

'Douglas is Locky’s middle name so that’s where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.

 Locky added: 'I have no idea where Roger came from, I just thought it was funny!'

During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella and Irene that he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'Douglas is Locky’s middle name so that’s where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' Irena explained

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'

As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'

She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'

Finale: During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella and Irene that he was in love with them - but ultimately sent Bella packing 

After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena , telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.

'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the 31-year-old nurse.

'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'
