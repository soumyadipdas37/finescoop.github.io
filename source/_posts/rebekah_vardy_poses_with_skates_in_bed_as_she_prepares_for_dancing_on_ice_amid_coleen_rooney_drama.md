Her rival Coleen Rooney reportedly wants to make a last-minute exit from their upcoming £1 million High Court libel battle.

But Rebekah Vardy brushed aside the drama as she shared a cheeky Instagram snap of herself wearing skates in bed on Wednesday, just a day after confirming she's joined the 2021 Dancing On Ice line-up.

The wife of Leicester City's Jamie Vardy, 38, partially covered her face with her duvet as she kicked her feet up in the air to show off her new footwear.

Mother-of-five Becky opted for comfort in sporty monochrome co-ords as she relaxed in her bedroom for the playful image. 

Referencing her upcoming appearance on the ITV competition, the WAG wrote: 'Got to break these babies in.' 

Meanwhile, sources claim those close to Coleen have been encouraging her to settle their dispute privately.

The pair have been at loggerheads ever since the wife of Derby County footballer Wayne Rooney, 34, accused Becky of leaking stories about her to the media last October - a claim she fiercely denies.

Taking to the rink: The wife of Leicester City's Jamie Vardy, 38, referenced her upcoming appearance on the ITV competition as she wrote: 'Got to break these babies in':

An insider told The Sun: 'Things have gone much further than many had expected. 

'Coleen is a rather shy and private person, so the idea of having personal matters relating to her and Wayne raked over in court is something that fills her with dread.' 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Coleen and Rebekah for further comment.

The new claims came after I'm A Celebrity star Becky addressed their highly-publicised feud on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain, where she declared she wants to 'clear her name'.

The reality star said: 'Look, we tried to sort things out amicably, it just didn't work. I understand people think it's ridiculous, but what was I meant to do? I need to clear my name. 

'I want to clear my name. I will do whatever that takes. I hope it's going to be resolved soon. It's just one of the things that has to go through the process unfortunately now.

'I found it really tough. But to be fair Piers, in comparison to what some people have gone through with COVID and things like that, it's incomparable.'

She added of her ITV stint: 'I'm so ready for the sequins and the full glam squad. After months of lockdown it'll be nice to get the glam on... I just think I want everyone to laugh at me really! 

Rink ready: The brunette revealed she is due to start training for next year's Dancing On Ice 'in a couple of weeks'

'My dad taught me how to stand up on a pair of skates when I was about 7 years old, we used to go skating a lot when my mum and dad split up, we would go with him to the local ice rink. 

'I'm really excited actually. The only time I've been ice skating since is when we take our kids to the rink.' 

Asked whether her husband Jamie, 33, is excited to see her compete on the show, she added: 'He says he hopes I don't fall over too much so I hope I don't fall over too much!'

Rebekah added that she decided to sign up for the show as she wanted 'everyone to laugh at her,' and revealed she is due to start training 'in a couple of weeks.' 

The brunette explained: 'I'm really looking forward to getting my teeth into that and get going with it. I'm going to give 100 per cent effort throughout. And I hopefully won't knock my Shergar teeth out.'

According to The Mirror, Coleen and Rebekah will face off in November – just over one year after the former accused the latter of leaking stories about her.  

Rebekah is seeking substantial damages in the subsequent libel trial, as she claims to have suffered 'severe and extreme hostility and abuse' in the fallout after the claims were published on Instagram. 

The Mirror reports that judge Mr. Justice Nicklin has stated a preliminary trial will decide the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of Coleen’s social media posts.

He has also given Coleen until October 2 to serve a 'statement of case'.

In the September 17 court order he stated: 'It is ordered by consent that there be a trial of the preliminary issue of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of.'

The half-day trial, he has stated, would be heard by a judge specialising in media and communication after November 15.

As of September 25 Coleen had yet to file a defense, though it has been revealed by the judge that she isn't obliged to do so until 28 days after the preliminary hearing.

Court costs are expected to stay under £25,000 on each side, according to the publication, with any party exceeding the limit being required to justify them.
