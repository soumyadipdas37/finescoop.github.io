Lauren Burnham said she and husband Arie Luyendyk Jr. have been 'trying for a couple of months' to conceive after suffering a miscarriage three months ago.

The Bachelor Nation beauty, 28, addressed the topic as she answered questions from fans on her Instagram Stories Wednesday while she had some downtime traveling.

A fan told the designer that she had 'recently had a miscarriage,' and Burnham's story was inspirational, then asked her if she was trying again after she and Luyendyk, 38, announced they'd suffered a miscarriage.

The latest: Lauren Burnham, 28, said she and husband Arie Luyendyk Jr., 38, have been 'trying for a couple of months' to conceive after suffering a miscarriage three months ago

'We have been trying for a couple of months,' Burnham said. 'I know it’s not been long yet, but since our miscarriage we’ve wanted another baby so bad.'

The Virginia native, who's mom to daughter Alessi, one, with Luyendyk, said she's been 'sad & discouraged the last couple of months' because 'of it,' but is 'trying to stay positive.'

Burnham took a longview approach toward the life issue, saying that 'it will happen when it’s our time.'

Burnham opened up to Us last month about their focus on conceiving, saying that she and the race car driver were in their second month of trying.

She said, 'I was always afraid that it wouldn’t work. I think that’s kind of a valid fear if you’ve gone through something like that or just a fear of having to go through it again.'

She told the publication that she was 'honestly scared' but didn't let it deter her from trying to expand her family.

'Sometimes I’m like, "OK, yes, we can do this. It’s going to be great. Alessi needs a playmate,"' she said. 'And then other times, I’m sitting there, like, "Oh my gosh, how am I ever going to manage doing everything I’m doing now with another baby?" 

'So I think I just have to jump in head first!'

Burnham, who exchanged vows with Luyendyk in January of 2019, told the outlet that she thinks she's 'in a place of peace with it' as she moves forward with optimism.

'I feel positive about the future, and I always want to be open with everyone and I think that by doing that, you can help a lot of people,' Burnham said. 'And I don’t think it’s something that should be taboo and people should be afraid to talk about. So I always try and make an effort to talk about the uncomfortable thing.'
