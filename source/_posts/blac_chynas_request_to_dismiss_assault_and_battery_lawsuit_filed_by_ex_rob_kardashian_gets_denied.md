Blac Chyna's request to dismiss an assault and battery lawsuit filed by her ex Rob Kardashian has been denied by the court.

The 32-year-old reality star was sued by Kardashian, 33, and his half-sister Kylie Jenner, 23, in 2017.

'The Motion for Summary Judgement filed by Angela Renee White on 02/20/2020 is Denied. Defendant's alternative motion for summary adjudication is DENIED as to both issues,' read the minutes from the hearing, according to an article Monday by People.

Chyna filed the motion to dismiss in February on grounds that she 'did not intend to inflict injury on Rob and because she did not in fact harm him, Rob's claim for assault and battery fail,' the filing stated.

Kardashian in the lawsuit claimed that Chyna tried to choke him with an iPhone cord in December 2016 during a fight at a home owned by Jenner.

He also alleged in court papers that in addition to suffering injuries to his neck, head and face that Chyna also extensively damaged Jenner's home.

Jenner claimed that damages were in excess of $100,000.

Chyna's motion to summarily dismiss the lawsuit included a document of 'undisputed' evidence that allegedly showed Kardashian 'did not suffer any congnizable' damage.

The motion claimed that 'the only ''harm'' Rob suffered that night night relates to his heartbreak that Chyna moved out of Kylie Jenner’s home with their newborn baby girl, Dream'.

Chyna and Kardashian have a three-year-old daughter Dream together.

The filing also noted that they reconciled days alter and Kardashian 'did not seek medical treatment' or 'suffer any loss of earnings' after the alleged assault.

Jenner also 'voluntarily dismissed her claims' in March 2018, according to court documents.

'Other than admitted damage to a T.V. set, Chyna did not cause any physical destruction to Kylie Jenner’s home during the alleged ''assault'',' Chyna's lawyer said in court papers.

Kardashian and Chyna split in February 2017 and agreed to joint custody of Dream in September 2017.

Chyna also has seven-year-old son King Cairo Stevenson with ex-fiance Tyga, 30, who previously dated Jenner.
