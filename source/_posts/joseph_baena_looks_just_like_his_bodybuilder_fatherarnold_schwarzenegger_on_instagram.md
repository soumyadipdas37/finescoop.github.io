Joseph Baena was the spitting image of his bodybuilder dad of Arnold Schwarzenegger in an Instagram snapshot posted Thursday.  

The 22-year-old fitness enthusiast lifted an obviously heavy barbell, while standing in his go-to gym shirtless.

His veins were bulging and he appeared to be sweating as he lifted the heavy weight.

He had on a pair of black basketball shorts and he appeared to be in a professional gym set-up.

On his Instagram Story, Baena gave his 193,000 followers a closer look at his workout routine.

In the brief clip, he chose an arm machine and lifted what appeared to be an extremely heavy weight.

He scrunched his face with each rep as they weight pulled close and away from the camera.

'The goal is to be thicc & wide,' wrote Baena, whose mother happens to be Arnold, 73, and ex wife Maria Shriver's, 64, former nanny Mildred Patricia, 59.

Earlier in the day, Joseph and the Terminator star were spotted riding their bikes in Santa Monica.

Interestingly, while the pair sported face masks to protect themselves from coronavirus, they were not wearing helmets.

Challenging himself: In the brief clip, he chose an arm machine and lifted what appeared to be an extremely heavy weight.

The duo appeared to be riding at a leisurely pace, avoiding any out-of-the-ordinary movements.

Joseph wore a disposable face mask, blue sweatshirt, and Vans slip-on sneakers. 

Arnold kept his eye on the road while pedaling his way down a cobblestone road and an intersection by the beach.

The former Governor of California and his son were perfectly dressed to pedal their way through the grey coastal community.

Last week, Arnold shared a snap from his 12-mile bike ride, posing by the Gold's Gym where he filmed the 1977 docudrama, Pumping Iron.

'I love stopping on my 12 mile bike rides to enjoy some of my fantastic memories,' he captioned the image. 'When I ride by the original Gold's where we shot Pumping Iron in 1975, I can almost hear the weights clanging around and smell the sweat.

'I can feel the joy of the friendships I built here. It's so important to remember where you came from, and all of the people who helped you along the way.'
