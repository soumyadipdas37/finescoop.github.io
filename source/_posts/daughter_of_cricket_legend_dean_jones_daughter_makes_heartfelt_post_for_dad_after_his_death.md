The daughter of Australian cricket legend Dean Jones has shared a heartfelt tribute to her dad following his tragic death. 

Jones, 59, died of a 'massive' heart attack at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai on Thursday, leaving the cricket world in shock and mourning the loss of one of the game's legends.

His daughter Augusta opened up about her heartbreak with a post on Instagram on Friday. 

'I cannot believe I am writing this. My heart is broken, My Dad. My Hero. The sweetest and most caring person you could ever meet,' she wrote.

'If only you could see now how many lives you touched. If only you could see now how loved you were.

'You held my hand through the toughest times this year, how will I do this without you?

'The heavens have opened their gates for another angel. Wait for me dad. Everything I do is for you. I love you Dad.'

Just two weeks before Jones' shock death, his daughter Phoebe shared a Father's Day Instagram post for 'dedicated' dad 

Just two weeks earlier his daughter Phoebe made an Instagram post for her dad for Father's Day, who was already in India at the time, sharing how much she loved him.

The snap shows Jones walking back to the pavilion with bat in his hand after being dismissed during a match in his heyday.

Phoebe, who was a little girl at the time, is seen waiting at the fence for her father.

'Can you spot me? This is me waiting for [dad] to come home and he's only just left!' she wrote.

Tragically, Phoebe did not get to see her father again.

In May, Jones' other daughter Augusta posted a pictured of the family-of-four in an embrace.

'As this strange year 2020 continues on, it has made me so grateful for the beautiful family that I have,' she wrote.

'This year has shown me how important it is to hold on to the things that truly matter - above all else.'

In August, Jones told his Instagram followers how 'proud' he was of his daughter for working through the coronavirus crisis.

'So proud of my daughter Gussie. She is a health care worker working with people who have disabilities,' he wrote, alongside a selfie of Augusta in personal protective equipment.

Phoebe previously shared an old happy snap of her parents in their youth.

'Stumbled across this pic of JJ and Deano whilst cleaning out the shed,' she wrote.

The Instagram post included the captions 'romantic picnic' and 'good thinking Deano'.

The news of Jones' death broke in Australia on Thursday evening after it was reported in India.

Star Sports India confirmed he died of a sudden cardiac arrest and said it was in communication with the Australian High Commission.

The cricket great played in 52 Tests for Australia and averaged 46.55 batting in the middle order.

He scored 3,631 runs and 11 centuries in his illustrious career.

'Dean Jones was a hero to a generation of cricketers and will forever be remembered as a legend of this great game,' Cricket Australia chairman Earl Eddings said.

'Anyone who watched cricket in the 1980s and 1990s will fondly recall his cavalier approach at the crease and the incredible energy and passion he brought to every game he played.

'This is a truly sad day. Deano's loss will be felt not just at home in Australia, but across the globe.'

Australia coach Justin Langer said Jones was integral to the rebuilding of the Test and ODI side that went on to dominate the sport for nearly 20 years.

'What a great player and a great bloke. We are shocked and very sad to hear of his passing,' Langer said.

'Deano was a true legend of Australian sport and world cricket, one of the great players and personalities in a golden time for the game.

'His role in the team's World Cup win in 1987 and the 1989 Ashes under AB were a huge turning point for Australian cricket.

'His double century in Madras was one of the greatest and most courageous innings of all time.

'We can only hope to make Australians as proud of our team as they were of Deano, he will be missed by the game and millions of people around the world.

'Our love to Jane and the girls.'

Lara, a former international cricketer for West Indies who had been commentating with Jones, shared a video of the pair jokingly boxing in the studio.

'I love you too Dean Jones!! You have been a joy and absolute pleasure to work with at Star Sports India,' he wrote.

'The world has has lost a real legend and lover of our great game, cricket.

'You will be dearly missed by many. RIP my brother. My sincere condolences to the Jones family.'

A classy right-handed batsman, Jones played in an era of great change in Australian cricket.

He played his first of 52 Tests against the mighty West Indies at Port of Spain in 1982 with his most famous innings his double century in the tied Madras Test in 1986.

There, he spent more than eight hours at the crease in 42C heat and severe humidity for his 210.

It earned him not only a place in Australian cricket folklore, but left him on a drip in hospital after losing eight kilos and any memory of the second half of his innings.

'The fractured memory of that amazing experience still jumps back into my mind in bits and pieces,' Jones wrote in his 1994 autobiography 'Deano My Call'.

'Some of them blurred and some crystal clear.

'Sometimes I have to refer to descriptions written at the time to fill in huge gaps in my own consciousness.'

Tests: 52

Runs: 3631

Centuries: 11

Average: 46.55

High score: 216

ODIs: 164

Runs: 6068

Centuries: 7

Average: 44.61

High score: 145

Former Australia coach Bob Simpson said he had not 'seen a braver innings'.

'He was running on adrenaline,' Simpson told Cricinfo.

'During breaks we would have one bloke waiting to take off his pads and another would strip him and put him in an ice bath just to try and revitalise him. It was immensely courageous.'

For all his toughness shown in that innings, Jones led the way with his aggression in the white-ball game during an era where teams were still cautious with their ODI batting.

His 6068 runs in the format was the second highest of all-time when he played his last match in 1994, while his strike-rate of 72.56 was also brisk for that era.

He played with flamboyance, not afraid to walk down the pitch to bowlers, attacked when running between the wickets and saved runs in the field.

The end of his time in Australia's Test team was controversial, with his axing in 1992 still one of the most perplexing in Australian cricket.

Former Australian cricket captain Allan Border told Foxsports.com.au Jones 'revolutionised the game'.

'I can't believe this news but I'd like to pay tribute to Brett Lee for everything he did,' Border said.

'Deano was unbelievable at the Test level but his aggression at the one day level will be remembered forever.

'He loved his family, cricket golf and wine. I loved batting with him and he backed me and for that I will always love him.'

Cricket greats posted their condolences when the shock news broke on Thursday night.

Former Australian captain Steve Smith described Jones' passing as 'awful' news.

'He was a wonderful player for Australia and he will be missed. My thoughts are with his family. RIP Deano,' Smith wrote.

David Warner said: 'I can't believe this news. So very sad to hear about this. RIP Deano, you will be missed.'

Legendary Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar said Jones' death was 'heartbreaking'.

'A wonderful soul taken away too soon. Had the opportunity to play against him during my first tour of Australia,' he said.

'May his soul rest in peace and my condolences to his loved ones.'
