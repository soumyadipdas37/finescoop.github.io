Retired AFL star Harley Bennell is under investigation for a potential COVID-19 breach after hugging his family at the airport on his return to Western Australia.

The former Melbourne Demons player landed in Perth on Thursday after he was ordered out of Queensland for leaving his club's bubble to visit an 'unapproved premises' in Maroochydore on September 19.

The 28-year-old hugged his mother Kayleen and three other family members on arrival at the airport before heading home for 14-day quarantine.

WA Police are investigating the interaction.

'The community of Western Australia is reminded of their responsibilities to help limit the spread of COVID-19,' a police spokesman told Herald Sun.  

Bennell remained on the Gold Coast with friends after his September 19 breach while the Demons tried to organise his flight home. 

The club was fined $50,000 for Bennell's breach and he soon announced his retirement from the AFL at the age of 27. 

Friends and family expressed their concerns for Bennell's welfare after he remained on the Gold Coast, while his partner Amy Crellin and daughter Carter left Queensland in the days after his breach.

Bennell was hospitalised for intoxication hours after announcing his retirement.

'I'm his mother and I'm very concerned for his well-being and mental state,' Bennell's mother Kayleen wrote on Facebook.

Former Fremantle coach Ross Lyon said Bennell was 'going to need support' on his departure from the AFL.

'I spoke to him after the COVID-19 breach on the Sunday night, and then over the last couple of days through text, because it was very hard to reach Harley on phone,' he said on Nine’s Footy Classified. 

'A boy’s dream comes to the end. It’s devastating.'

Earlier, Melbourne CEO Gary Pert said Bennell's actions on September 19 were selfish and a 'clear breach' of the AFL's COVID-19 protocols.

'He has made a very poor decision, which is incredibly disappointing,' Mr Pert said. 

'He has not only put himself, his teammates and the competition at risk, but he has failed to live up to the values of the Melbourne Football Club.'

Pert apologised for the midfielder's behaviour and said the club accepted the $50,000 fine. 

Upon learning of a potential breach, the Demons immediately notified the AFL, which investigated the matter. 

AFL General Counsel Andrew Dillon said the AFL's protocols are the competition's license to play and anyone breaching them will be held to account.

'Harley knew the rules and could have put his club and the competition at risk on the eve of a finals campaign,' Dillon said.

The midfielder and former No.2 draft pick took to social media to call time on his rollercoaster 88-game career, which began in 2011 at Gold Coast.

Posting a photo on Instagram of himself in a jumper at all three of his AFL clubs - the Suns, Fremantle and the Demons - Bennell said it had been the 'best 10 years of my life'.

'Thank you to everyone that was involved. It was an awesome ride,' Bennell wrote. 

Bennell appeared set to earn a new contract with the club before the indiscretion after playing five games in his first season at Melbourne.

Injuries kept him to just two games in a four-year stint at Fremantle and he departed the Dockers in July 2019.

Melbourne acknowledged Bennell's retirement, posting on social media: 'Wishing you all the best for the future, Harley'.

Bennell played his best football at the Suns, enjoying a breakout season in 2012 when he finished second in the club's best-and-fairest behind Gary Ablett Jnr.

Disciplinary issues saw him fall out-of-favour at Gold Coast and he was traded to Fremantle at the end of the 2015 season.
