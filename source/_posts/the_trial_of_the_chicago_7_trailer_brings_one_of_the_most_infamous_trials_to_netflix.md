One of the most infamous trials in American history is coming to life on Netflix, with the new trailer for The Trial of the Chicago 7.

The Trial of the Chicago 7 features an all-star cast including Sacha Baron Cohen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Frank Langella, Eddie Redmayne, Mark Rylance, Jeremy Strong, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Michael Keaton, John Carroll Lynch and Alex Sharp.

Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, Molly's Game) directs from his own script, based on the incredible true story of the seven people stemming from the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

The trailer begins with shots inside and outside the packed courtroom, with defense attorney William Kuntsler (Mark Rylance) asking Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen), 'Do you know why you're on trial here?'

The trailer cuts to the demonstration outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, when cops start racking rounds into their shotguns. 

The crowds chant, 'The whole world is watching!' while Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) is asked if he's all right, and he says he was 'until I saw that,' referring to the cops loading their guns.

As their chant continues, we see shots of Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), while Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen III) saying, 'Martin is dead, Bobby is dead, Jesus is dead. They tried it peacefully. We're gonna try something else.'

We also see John Mitchell (John Doman) refer to the protesters as 'a threat to national security,' after they're referred to as 'rebels without a job.'

Hoffman is seen telling a group of radicals that, 'It's a revolution. We may have to hurt somebody's feelings.'

Back in court, Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) asks Hoffman if, 'when you came to Chicago, were you hoping to draw the police into a confrontation?'

When he doesn't answer right away, Schultz adds, incredulously, 'I'm concerned you have to think about it.'

'Give me a moment would you, friend? I've never been on trial for my thoughts before,' Hoffman responds as the trailer comes to an end.

The defendants who made up the Chicago 7 were Hoffman, Rubin, Hayden, David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch), Rennie Davis (Alex Sharp), John Friones (Danny Flaherty) and Lee Weiner (Noah Robbins).

They were charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot, and while five of the seven were originally convicted, all of the riot charges were ultimately overturned.

The film was originally slated for a theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, though the rights were ultimately sold to Netflix amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with Netflix releasing the film on October 16.
