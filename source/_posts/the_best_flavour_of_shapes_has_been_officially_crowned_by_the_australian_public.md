Arnott's Shapes have crowned Chicken Crimpy as the superior flavour based on weeks of polling the Australian public.

The delicious snack - which can be found in neon orange packaging - was the clear winner, beating out Cheese and Bacon, Pizza and Barbecue in the semi finals.

On August 16 the brand announced on its new Instagram page that it would be holding a championship to decide that nation’s ultimate favourite, pitting Chicken Crimpy, Savoury, Cheese and Bacon, Cheddar, Pizza, Aussie Legends, Barbecue and Nacho Cheese against each other.

“Australia, it's up to you. Your all time favourite snacks are going head-to-head over the next few weeks in a battle that will announce the ultimate Shapes flavour of all-time in the #ShapesBracket,' the caption read.  

The grand final on August 27 saw Chicken Crimpy and Barbecue compete for first prize, with the former coming out on top.

'This is honestly the only way this competition could have ended though,' one customer said.

'Well there are no surprises there,' said another. A third added: 'Good to see a fair end to the competition'. 

Media manager Bruno Bouchet, from Sydney, released his own 'power rankings' of Arnott's Shapes on July 20, but he didn't put Chicken Crimpy in first place.

'Don't bother commenting, this isn't up for discussion,' he wrote on Instagram.

In first place, or the 'God Tier', Bruno nominated Nacho Cheese, which returned to supermarkets after a Change.Org petition was started two years ago to see the flavour brought back from the dead.  

Second, in his 'Royalty Tier', were two classic flavours: Pizza and Cheese and Bacon. 

The 'Adam Sandler Tier' of mid-range options held Cheddar, Chicken Crimpy and Meat Pie, before he moved onto the 'Pleb Tier' with Vegemite and Cheese and BBQ flavour.

Finally, the worst of the bunch - placed in the 'Cat Vomit Tier' - was Shapes Savoury and Sausage Sizzle.

Bruno didn't explain why he had chosen some Shapes to be higher than others but he did try each of the biscuits as part of the 'research', and results were final.

But not everyone was in agreement with the rankings.

'Uh no... BBQ shapes are definitely not on the pleb level mate,' one woman said.

'All wrong! Chicken Crimpy should not be below Pizza and Cheese and Bacon?!?!?' Said another.

A third added: 'Real ranking is BBQ and Pizza as number one. Cheddar and Cheese and Bacon with a side of Chicken Crimpy in second place, and then all the rest are s***'.

Others said he had 'got it right' with the ranking system and they equally enjoy the Nacho Cheese flavour.
