Bella Varelis accused her former best friend Irena Srbinovska of 'lying' during Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor. 

And, if you thought that was cause for drama, think again, because Irena is set to reach her breaking point on Thursday's episode. 

In a new trailer, the 31-year-old is seen bursting into tears at an upcoming cocktail party as she reveals in interview, she can't 'listen to Bella anymore'.

In the promo, Bella, 25, appears to be putting on quite the confident performance at the party, laughing and happily chatting away with Locky.  

And it's not long before Irena becomes fed up with the shameless display to get Locky's attention.

'It's triggering me,' she's heard saying in the teaser. 'Here she is, the biggest grin on her face. I can't just sit here and listen to Bella anymore.'

Irena is then seen fleeing the cocktail party and breaking down in tears, revealing she fears Locky is 'slipping away' from her. 

'The fact that he could be slipping away is devastating,' she says. 'It's already starting to break my heart.' 

This comes after Bella told the remaining ladies on The Bachelor that Irena has 'manipulated her way through the show' during Wednesday episode.

'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.

'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women.

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
