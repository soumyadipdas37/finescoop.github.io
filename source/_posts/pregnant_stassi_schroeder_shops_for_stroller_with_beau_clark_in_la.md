Stassi Schroeder and her fiancé Beau Clark looked happy on Wednesday as they ran errands before the arrival of their first child together. 

The former Vanderpump Rules star, who is 25 weeks into her pregnancy, and her future husband were seen browsing a number of high-end strollers. 

'Work it!' the 40-year-old Italian actor could be heard saying on his Instagram Story, as the 32-year-old expectant mother playfully pushed a stroller in a pair of Gucci loafers.

In the footage, the Straight Up With Stassi podcast host showcased her baby bump in an oversized beige top which she styled with a pair of fitted black trousers.

While strutting around with her blonde tresses in a sleek bun, Schroeder kept her accessories to just a medium-sized a black Chanel purse and a few silver necklaces. 

As she closely flanked her partner's side, the pair both kept their mouths and noses covered under cloth face masks.

Like Schroeder, Clark sported a laid-back ensemble, which included an olive green t-shirt and dark-wash jeans.

'Hopefully I'll have an idea for a stroller after this cocktail,' Clarked jokingly captioned a picture of his iced beverage in front of two menus.

Schroeder's shopping trip comes just days after Tamron Hall hit back at allegations she 'went rogue' while interviewing the fired reality star last week. 

The 50-year-old host of The Tamron Hall Show spoke about claims Schroeder wasn't happy with the interview during Tuesday's episode. 

'She knew the subject matter. She knew what I was going to ask her,' said Hall of her exchange with Schroeder.

'The other day I was told that there was a report that Stassi felt "unprepared" and that it was "awkward." Even that I had gone rogue - whatever that means,' began Tamron, referring to an UsWeekly article in which a source claimed Schroeder 'felt like she was put on the spot.'  

Hall continued: 'Let me just be open because I'm expecting everybody who's participating in this show today, I want them to be open, so I have to do the same. It's why I wanted this show to be honest with you.

'So I'm going to take you behind-the-scenes of TV. Now, I don't tell people the specific questions I'm going to ask them. How they answer, that's up to them. But the topic and everything that we discussed, Stassi knew.'

The talk show host also claimed Schroeder's team asked her not to raise the former reality TV star's controversial comments on the #MeToo movement, a request with which Hall says she complied.

'It hit me to my gut that I didn't ask her,' said Hall. 'Given that she was five months pregnant, the issue of race was hard enough for her and for me and it was a lot to unpack, including that Nazi comment, so I said we were not going to go down that road but we would have this difficult conversation that we all should have to provide a better platform for our children.'

However Stassi then raised the topic of her own accord, telling Tamron, 'I look back at that podcast and I'm so embarrassed that I even had those thoughts, much less put it out there.'

Getting grilled: Schroeder sat down for her first interview since her Vanderpump Rules firing for the Tamron Hall Show last week

Schroeder, whose past racially insensitive actions resurfaced last summer leading to her firing, admitted she 'was a Karen' after Hall asked her about why she reported her black co-star Faith Stowers to the police in 2018 for a crime she did not commit.

Hall said she was 'shocked' at her 'level of ignorance as it relates to race,' specifically because she is from New Orleans and lives in Los Angeles, both of which are highly populated, diverse cities.  

The pair's interview occurred last Thursday, marking Schroeder's first TV appearance since being fired from Vanderpump Rules in June.
