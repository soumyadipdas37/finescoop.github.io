Authorities said multiple shops and residential buildings nearby were destroyed by the blast

One clip, released by Zhuhai Channel, shows terrified onlookers fleeing for their lives as a massive fire erupted from the site.

Another video from the same outlet shows the hotel seriously damaged and the street covered by debris following the blast. Police officers can be seen helping one person who appears to be injured.

The blast took place at 9am in Tenghu Hotel in the city's district of Doumen, officials announced on social media.

A statement posted by the Doumen District Propaganda Department claimed that rescuers attended the scene at the earliest possible time. The blaze was put out shortly after at around 10am.

No one was trapped in the building, the authority said. Three people were injured, including two with minor injuries and one with burns, it added.

In a follow-up statement, the propaganda officials stated that a total of nine people had been rescued. The blast damaged around 150 square metres (1,614 square feet) of the hotel.

The post said that six fire-fighting teams, equipped with 19 fire engines and 95 firefighters, had been involved in the rescue efforts.

Officials also criticised allegations that 255 people had been taken to the hospital by ambulances.

They confirmed that the number had been input into the registering system for casualties, but claimed it was an 'improper operation' by relevant staff.
