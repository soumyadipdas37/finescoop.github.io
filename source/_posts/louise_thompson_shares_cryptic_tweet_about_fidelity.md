Come again? Louise Thompson shared a cryptic tweet referring to cheating on Thursday

Shocker: The former Made In Chelsea star, 30, who is engaged to personal trainer Ryan Libbey, took to Twitter to share a message with her 520,700 followers reading: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful'

Louise's tweet came just hours after she enjoyed a family dinner with Ryan and her brother Sam Thompson, which she documented on Instagram.

The star did not provide any clarity over who she was referencing in her message. MailOnline has contacted Louise's representative for comment.  

In April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.

The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December.

In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'At the beginning it wasn't that easy but we've had to make a really conscious effort to make some changes.

'We are actively working on our relationship now. For the first couple of years in a relationship you're still in that love phase, there are still new things to experience. 

The family! Louise's tweet came just hours after she enjoyed a family dinner with Ryan and her brother Sam Thompson, which she documented on Instagram

We've been together for four and a half years now and you do go through phases. You have to try a bit harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.

'We are communicating more and having chats about what each other wants, so now we have set some boundaries.'

The pair had booked to marry at London's Kew Gardens in December 2019 but cancelled their plans, with Louise saying: 'It's just the bigger picture for myself and Ryan that we need to get to grips with first.'

Months later, Ryan revealed they had agreed on a venue in Ibiza for their wedding to go ahead in spring 2020 – but now Louise says they're still 'figuring out what it is we want' and their plans have come to a halt.

She said: 'No… actually, we haven't, we are still sort of figuring out what it is we want to do because we're so busy with the business.

'I am someone that really wants to have the best day ever and I want to be in the right space, I am just not sure exactly what I want yet.'
