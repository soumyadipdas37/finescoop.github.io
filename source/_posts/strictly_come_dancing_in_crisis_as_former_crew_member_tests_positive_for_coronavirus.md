Strictly Come Dancing has reportedly been left in crisis.

According to a new report, a former crew member tested POSITIVE for coronavirus, just days before recording on the new series of the BBC show is set to begin.

As a result 'Everyone was told to leave!' according to a source.

According to The Sun, the lighting expert spent a week working on the dance contest's set.

Following his positive test result, at least five staff who were in close contact with him were sent home and told to self-isolate and await tests of their own, according to the report.

Additionally, a deep clean of the set using powerful electrostatic sprayers, was apparently ordered. 

The publication's source also claimed that panic spread quickly among the professional dancers who were due to start filming in the studios tomorrow.  

A source told MailOnline: 'the crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.

'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.' 

MailOnline has contacted Strictly Come Dancing for comment.
