The Block's Shaynna Blaze accused contestants Luke and Jasmin of cheating during a tense conversation on Tuesday's episode.

After meeting the Western Australian couple for the first time, the 57-year-old judge asked host Scott Cam if she could have a private word with them.

Shaynna then told Luke and Jasmin, 36, that she had some concerns about their winning kids' bedroom, after discovering they'd completely ripped off their design.

'I remember saying on the day, the bunk and everything, I remember saying, "I may have seen that before,"' Shaynna explained.

While Shaynna initially thought they had taken inspiration from former Block contestants Kyal and Kara, she said she went home and did some 'fishing'.

'It felt familiar, and then I found this,' she said, before pulling up a series of comparison photos on a tablet.

Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out, with Shaynna pointing out all the similarities.

'Spotted wallpaper, bunk, animals, saffron, aztec, grey, white sheer,' she listed, pointing out that 'the only difference' was the chair and how they put it together. 

But Jasmin didn't seem surprised by the similarities, and confessed she'd shown everyone the same photo, calling it her 'inspo'.

'It wasn't a secret,' added Jasmin. 

'So, you're calling it inspiration,' continued Shaynna. 'What happens is inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another.'

Shaynna explained that it was one thing for them to copy a design for their own home, but she reminded them that they were in a competition.

'You haven't changed it up enough. It's not fair on the other contestants that they can win a room, with money, on someone else's ideas,' said Shaynna

While Luke, 35, insisted they'd 'put their own spin on it', Shaynna maintained that it was still too similar. 

'If you scroll on Instagram, everyone's doing the same s**t... It's like, yeah, we're "original". As original as the next house,' said a resolute Jasmin.
