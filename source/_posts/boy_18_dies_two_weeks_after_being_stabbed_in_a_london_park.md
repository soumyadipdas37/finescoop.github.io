A teenager has died two weeks after being repeatedly stabbed in broad daylight.

Police say 18-year-old Daniel Bytyci was fatally wounded when he was attacked on a playing field in Pinner, north west London, on Wednesday August 26th.

Daniel, who lived in nearby Harrow, was rushed to hospital following the incident on Montesole Playing Fields just after 6pm that day.

Daniel Bytyci, 18, was fatally wounded when he was attacked while on Montesole Playing Fields in Pinner, north west London, on Wednesday August 26th. He died in hospital on Thursday

Two 15-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday in connection with the fatal attack. Two men aged 22 and 24 have been released on bail having been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder

But he lost his fight for life yesterday, 15 days after the savage attack.

He is the eleventh teenager to be stabbed to death in London this year.

Two 15-year-old boys, who can't be named for legal reasons, have been charged in connection with the attack. They are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday.

Detective Inspector Claire Hine, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: 'I would appeal to anyone who was in Montesole Playing Fields that evening and saw this incident, or the events leading up to this incident, to contact police.

'While enquiries remain ongoing to establish the motive to Daniel's murder, there is nothing at this time to suggest it is gang related.'

Chief Superintendent Roy Smith, Commander of the Met's North West Command Unit which covers Pinner, added: 'My officers responded immediately to this call and, along with our colleagues from the London Ambulance Service, they did all they could to save Daniel's life.

'My thoughts are with Daniel's family and friends at this tragic time.

'Two people have been charged in connection with this incident and the investigation into Daniel's murder remains ongoing. I would like to reiterate that my officers will use every tactic and every opportunity to bear down on violence and arrest those intent on engaging in criminality on our boroughs.'

Two men, aged 22 and 24, who were also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder have been bailed until a date later this month.
