An artist who creates large-scale designs in sand and snow has produced his 500th work on a Somerset beach. 

Simon Beck, 62, used a rake and a magnetic compass to make his latest geometrical design on Brean Beach near Burnham on Sea, where he creates many of his artworks. 

He said: 'It's a major landmark. I have a lifetime ambition of making 1,000 drawings by the time I reach the age of 80 so I feel a certain amount of achievement to be at 500.' 

Mr Beck, a former cartographer from Taunton, began creating large-scale land art in 2004 when he used snow shoes to realise a design in the Alps. 

His latest effort was in the style of a Sierpinski triangle - a triangle made up of smaller triangles. But high winds and dry sand on the beach on Saturday meant the image was not quite of the standard he had hoped for. 

Mr Beck's previous efforts have included other similarly intricate geometric designs, as well as a recent commission based on TV show Sandition.

Mr Beck used a rake and a magnetic compass to create the geometrical design. However, high winds and dry sands meant he lost some definition in the drawing. He said 'it's mixed feelings' and is 'disappointed not to have a better result'. He added: 'I'd feel a lot happier if we had a really good result, but you win some you lose some, don't you?'
