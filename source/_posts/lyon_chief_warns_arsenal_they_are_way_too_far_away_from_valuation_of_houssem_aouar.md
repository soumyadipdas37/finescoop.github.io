Arsenal have been warned they will have to substantially increase their £30m offer for Lyon midfield maestro Houssem Aouar.

Aouar is valued at £54m and Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said: 'There will be very few departures, Arsenal are way too far away from his value.

'Ware counting on him to have a great match against Lorient and to lead Lyon into the Champions League next year.'

Arsenal have seen an initial bid for Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar rejected 

Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas believes Arsenal don't have the funds required to sign Aouar

And football.london are reporting that the Gunners will now significantly increase their offer for the player after seeing their initial bid rejected last week.

Aouar, a France Under 21 international, has spent his entire career to date at Lyon, making over 130 appearances for the club.

Arsenal have improved immensely under Arteta but they are certainly in need of a player who can create chances with regularity, especially with Mesut Ozil having been frozen out.

Arsenal have rebuffed approaches from Atletico Madrid and Torino to take Lucas Torreira on loan. Arsenal want to sell the midfielder and retain an interest in Atletico's Thomas Partey.

Mikel Arteta is desperate to bring in a midfielder before the window closes on October 5

The French club are demanding a fee of £54million for the hugely talented 22-year-old
