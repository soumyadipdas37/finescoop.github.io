As the Woolworths Disney+ Ooshies promotion comes to a close, Big W has launched a huge sale on the popular collectable toys.

After an eagle-eyed shopper in Western Australia shared the news on social media, customers are now rushing to get their hands on the discounted plastic toys.

The prices start from as little as $3 for a packet of three and up to $10 for a packet of six. 

The Big W sale is offered nationally, but stock numbers may vary across stores.

Customers are spoiled for choice as a variety of Ooshies are available, including Marvel and Toy Story characters.

But the Big W figurines are different compared to the Woolworths Disney+ Ooshies available. 

Regardless, shoppers on Facebook shared their excitement about wanting to continue growing their collection. 

'$10 for 6! How cheap is that? You have to spend $180 to get 6 in Woolies and aren't guaranteed to get the ones you want!' one shopper said.

'I didn't know [Big W] sold them,' another said.

Others said they will need to avoid taking their children to Big W in an effort to save money on buying more Ooshies.

Those wanting to complete their Woolworths Disney+ Ooshies collection will need to get in supermarket stores quick as the promotion is set to end at the end of the week. 

Availability of the collectables varies from store-to-store around Australia but online redemption of Ooshies will cease everywhere other than Victoria on Monday.

'It's apparent customers of all ages have loved collecting these Ooshies and their popularity completely exceeded our expectations. Because of this, we expect the last of our stock to be collected by the end of this weekend,' Woolworths' chief marketing officer Andrew Hicks said.

Customers living in Victoria will still have time to collect the figurines over the coming weeks after the launch was delayed across the state due to Stage Four lockdown restrictions. 

Mr Hicks reassured Victorian shoppers there will be plenty of Ooshies around to collect in the weeks ahead while supplies last. 

'I want to reassure our Victorian customers these lower stock levels do not apply to them. We created a separate allotment from when we delayed the launch of the program,' he said.

He added: 'We're thrilled to see how many customers have enjoyed collecting the Disney+ Ooshies since its launch... particularly during a very challenging year.

'We'd like to thank our team for their support in executing the program in stores and online and our customers for helping us create such a memorable program.'

Shoppers can collect one of the 36 iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar with every $30 spent at checkout.

Pre-loved or unwanted Ooshies can be recycled in any Woolworths store until January 31, 2021.
