Jon Gosselin, who gained fame as the father of twins and sextuplets on the hit reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8, recently enjoyed a brief trip to Florida with girlfriend Colleen Conrad, two of his eight kids and some friends.

And on Sunday Conrad took to Instagram to share a series of photos taken during their holiday in the sun on the beaches of Ponte Vedra, which is near Jacksonville in the northeast part of the state.

'A quick, short but amazing and also needed quick vacation! Love my family and our friends in Ponte Vedra!!!' she wrote in the caption.

All five of the photos were taken on a boardwalk, near the sand, with the Atlantic Ocean used as the the backdrop. 

In one, Gosselin and Conrad flashed big beaming smiles and had their arms around his daughter Hannah and son Collin, 16.

There's also one where the former reality star gave Conrad a piggyback ride as the waves came crashing onto the beach, and a group snap of the six ladies who all spent time together on the trip.

The Pennsylvania native and Conrad have been dating for nearly six years but they have known each other nearly their entire lives. He told a We tv panel in 2018 that they grew up just three blocks from each other as kids, and that Conrad's sister used to babysit him. 

Hannah and Collin have been living with their father full-time since February 2018. The other four sextuplets: Alexis, Aaden, Joel and Leah, and twins Mady and Cara, 19, live with their mother, Kate Gosselin. 

The former couple first welcomed their twins in 2001; the sextuplets followed in 2004. 

Most recently Kate Gosselin starred in the reality dating series, Kate Plus Date, in 2019.

Following the birth of the sextuplets, the Gosselin's were featured in the NBC reality TV show Home Delivery. They were also featured in a special on Discovery Health in 2005 and another special the following year. 

This all led to what would become the hit reality show, Jon & Kate Plus 8, which began airing in 2007.

The Gosselins would eventually split in 2009 after a decade of marriage, amid rumors of infidelity, and the reality show was renamed, Kate Plus 8.      

As of May 2020, Gosselin works as an IT director at a private, non-profit healthcare facility.
