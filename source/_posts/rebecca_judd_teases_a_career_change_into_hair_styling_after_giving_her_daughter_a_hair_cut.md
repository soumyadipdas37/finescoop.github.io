She has described life in lockdown with her four children in Melbourne as chaos.

And over the weekend AFL WAG Rebecca Judd was forced to give her daughter Billie, six, a haircut with a pair of herb scissors after the youngster hacked her hair into a mullet while unsupervised. 

Speaking on her radio show 3pm Pick Up, Rebecca recalled finding several locks on the floor while checking in on Billie before her Zoom class on Friday.

'I walk into the office and I just see these locks of hair. I think they're about 10 centimetres long all over the floor,' she said. 

'And then I look at her and I'm thinking is she on with the classroom, is she on mute or not because I wanted to yell and swear, but maybe she's in class... so I'm kinda trying to talk to her behind the laptop going what is going on. 

'[Billie] cut the front of her hair and then left the back, [giving herself] the mullet.' 

DIY cut: Rebecca recalled finding hair on the floor while checking in on Billie before her Zoom class on Friday. She said: 'She cut the front of her hair and then left the back, [giving herself] the mullet. I was like... I've got to save this child and this horrible hair cut she's given herself

Quick thinking: The brunette beauty said that with all her children at home, doing arts and crafts activities, she was unable to find scissors and was forced to improvise with herb scissors

The Postcards presenter continued: 'I was like fire out I've got to save this child and this horrible hair cut she's given herself.

'I so wish I had taken a before photo,' she added with a laugh.

The brunette beauty said that with all her children at home doing arts and crafts activities, she was unable to find scissors and was forced to improvise with a garden tool. 

Mum to the rescue: Bec said, 'The only scissors I could find was those little herb scissors... So I looped all her off, tied it up, she's got the chicest bob.' Her co-host Monty Dimond joked: 'I looks great, you've got another career in you... Herb cutting scissor hair cuts'

'The only scissors I could find was those little herb scissors, the little metal herb scissors. So I looped all her off, tied it up. She's got the chicest bob,' she said.

Her co-host Monty Dimond joked: 'It looks great, you've got another career in you... Herb cutting scissor hair cuts.' 

The Instagram influencer quipped: 'Oh, it's got a nice ring to it!'

Rebecca and her husband, retired AFL star Chris Judd, share four children, son Oscar, nine, daughter Billie, six, and three-year-old twins Tom and Darcy.
