She's gearing up to train for her stint on BBC One's competition series Strictly Come Dancing.

And Maisie Smith ensured she enjoyed her last moments of leisure as she took advantage of the sunny weather and hopped on a bus ride to Southend On Sea earlier this month.

The EastEnders star, 19, couldn't contain her happiness as she went sightseeing around the resort town with her friends and family before her few busy months.

She is just days away from beginning training for Strictly's new series, which will begin in October after being shortened due to the COVID-19 crisis, but is yet to even meet her professional dance partner. 

Good Morning Britain presenter Ranvir Singh revealed that the contestants haven't prepared for the show yet earlier this month, leaving 2013 contestant Susanna Reid shocked.

It was recently claimed that the male professional dancers are in fierce competition to be partnered up with Maisie.

A source told The Sun: 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer.  

Meanwhile, the auburn-haired beauty also reportedly turned down a record deal – which promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue' – so that she could take part on Strictly this year.

She is said to have been told by BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly. 

An insider added to the publication: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality. 

'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.'
