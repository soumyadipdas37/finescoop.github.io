They are said to have started dating earlier this year.

And Kendall Jenner was spotted enjoying an evening out with her beau Devin Booker at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, California, on Friday.

The TV personality, 24, looked sensational with the professional basketball player, 23, as she slipped into a red satin two-piece that teamed a backless halterneck top with chic trousers.

Wow! Kendall Jenner looked stunning in a red satin two-piece as she enjoyed dinner with her beau Devin Booker in Santa Monica on Friday

Kendall's ensemble showed off a hint of her toned abs and slender figure, while she boosted her statuesque figure with a pair of black heels.

Her brunette locks were brushed into a sleek, straight style that cascaded over her shoulders, and she used a light palette of make-up for the outing.

Kendall completed her look by carrying her personal items in a small Louis Vuitton handbag, while she also kept safe amid the coronavirus crisis by wearing a mask.

Devin, meanwhile, kept things casual in a white logo t-shirt that he paired with beige trousers and a white baseball cap.

Their outing comes after the pair exchanged flirty messages under Kendall's Instagram post earlier this month. 

Kendall shared a stunning snap in which she had transformed her eye colour with a filter while she added a strawberry emoji.   

Following the post, Devin then posted underneath 'I like strawberries', before Kendall responded with a further series of emojis.  

Hot on the heels of their messages, she then shared an incredible bikini-clad snap in a striped bikini which showed her phone connecting to a call.

In June, the duo were seen getting into the same SUV as they left a dinner date at Nobu. Prior to this they allegedly embarked on a road trip to Arizona in April.

The road trip caused romance speculation to resurface after she was posting a number of smoldering bikini pictures in front of some breathtaking rock formations. 

While the superstar did not specify the location, she did write in the caption that the pictures were taken a 'few weeks ago.'

Four days prior, Booker had posted an Instagram album that showed him enjoying the sights of Slide Rock State Park in Arizona.

Oh my: Following her flirty message, Kendall sent temperatures soaring as she sizzled in a bikini on her Stories - in a snap which was no doubt set to delight the Phoenix Suns player

After Kendall posted her new pictures, TMZ pointed out that 'they look kinda similar in scenery' to the ones Devin posted earlier this week.

Devin's snaps were also throwbacks, as the Phoenix Suns player had spent the entire week in Orlando, Florida for the NBA bubble.

The hunk has a home in Paradise Valley, Arizona less than 200 miles from Slide Rock State Park, but put it for sale this February according to the Los Angeles Times.

The athlete, who attended University of Kentucky and Moss Point High School, Grandville High School, reportedly made $27M in 2019.
