Arsenal have turned down an approach from Sheffield United for their striker prospect Folarin Balogun

The Blades are understood to have offered £3m plus add-ons for the 19 year-old.

But Arsenal responded by asking for a total package worth in the region of £15m, comprising an initial payment with further bonuses.

Arsenal have turned down an approach from Sheffield United for Folarin Balogun

England Under 19 striker Balogun has less than a year left on his contract.

And Arsenal’s valuation stunned the Blades given Balogun will be free to sign a pre-contract agreement from January to leave at the end of his current deal, a situation which will earn the Gunners a small compensation fee.

Sheffield United are looking to bolster their attacking options with a new striker in the present transfer window.

Their move for Balogun comes amid links with another young England striker in Liverpool's Rhian Brewster.

Chris Wilder's men fired a blank when they began their season on Monday with a 2-0 defeat at home to Wolves. 

Arsenal, meanwhile, started with an eye-catching 3-0 win against Fulham but Balogun did not make the substitute bench for the game at Craven Cottage.
