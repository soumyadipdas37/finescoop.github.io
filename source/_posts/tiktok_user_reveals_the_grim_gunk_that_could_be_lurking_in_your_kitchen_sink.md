A TikTok user shared a shocking clip to alert people about the brown gunk that could be lurking in their plug holes - and revealed the best hacks for cleaning it. 

Natasha Witts, from Caversham, Berkshire, shared the horrifying video on social media as a warning to people with smelly plugs in their kitchen or bathroom. 

As soon as she unscrewed the plug fitting from her kitchen sink, it was clear something unsavoury was hiding underneath. 

Once removed, an eye-watering amount of brown grime was unveiled, which is usually hidden from view by the plug hole cover. 

Natasha Witts, from Caversham, Berkshire, took out a screwdriver and began removing the plug hole cover (left) and as she started picking it up the nasty brown sludge was revealed (right)

She shared a video of the revolting gunk she found under her sink fitting (pictured) with her TikTok followers

In her quest to eradicate the disgusting goo she sprayed it with cleaning products before using a toothbrush to get into all the nooks and crannies. 

As she began to scrub, the grotesque gunk soon lifted to show the white plastic plug fixing beneath. 

Natasha, a sales executive, also took a long brush and buried it down the basin in order to get rid of anything else unpleasant.

To clear out the rest, she poured in a generous helping of bicarbonate of soda and vinegar before adding some disinfectant followed by boiling water from the kettle. 

Horrified viewers took to the comments to share their thoughts on the revolting discovery video, which has been liked more than 36,000 times. 

In a bid to tackle the nasty mess in her plug, she sprayed the hole and plug hole fixture all over with cleaning products. Some of the brown gunk had already started to escape from the plug hole

Natasha then took out a toothbrush and scrubbed at all the nooks and crannies and after some elbow grease the white plastic plug hole beneath was finally visible

Viewers of the Tik Tok video were horrified by the results, with several remarking that they were rushing to their sinks to clean their own. The brown goo was living on the underside of the metal plug hole too 

One person said: 'Watching this at 10.30pm in bed. Now I have to get up and clean my sinks.'

'Triggered. Everyone with OCD is now running to the sink, another thing to add to the list,' another added. 

Meanwhile others were left dumbfounded that the plug fixing is able to be unscrewed. 

The cleaning revelation comes as a savvy mother, believed to be from Australia, shared a clever trick for disposing of hot grease without spilling a single drop down the drain. 

A savvy mother, believed to be from Australia, has told how she safely disposes of grease by first lining the sink with tin foil (left) to prevent any spilling down the pipe. Then, once the grease hardens, she explained it should be folded (right) and thrown in the bin

Her trick involved stuffing a sheet of tinfoil into the bottom of her sink, ensuring it fully covered the drain pipe.

She then poured the hot grease she had left over from cooking into the foil and waited until it had hardened, before folding the sheet over and throwing it in the bin.

In response to her clever trick, other people took to the comments on the Facebook cleaning group to share their hacks - including one woman who revealed she recycles grease and uses it as cooking oil.
