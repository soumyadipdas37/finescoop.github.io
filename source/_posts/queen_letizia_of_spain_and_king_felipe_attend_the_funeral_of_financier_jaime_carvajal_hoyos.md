The King and Queen of Spain today put on a sombre display as they attended the funeral of finance CEO Jaime Carvajal Hoyos in Madrid.

The CEO of Arcano bank died from a sudden heart attack, aged 56, Spanish media has reported, leaving behind his wife Xandra and three daughters, 

His father Jaime Carvajal Urquijo was a school friend of King Felipe's father, King Juan Carlos, who moved to the UAE last month a bid in to prevent his personal affairs from undermining his son King Felipe VI's reign.

While Juan Carlos is not under formal investigation, officials in Spain and Switzerland are looking into revelations about his financial affairs made by a former mistress, German businesswoman Corinna Larsen. 

The death of Jaime is the second tragedy to hit his family in recent months, after his wife's father died from Covid-19 in March.

Jaime Carvajal Hoyos, studied physics at university and began his banking career in the US after graduating from Princeton, working in mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers, before joining the World Bank in 1997. 

A year later he married Spanish aristocrat Xandra Falcó, the Marchioness of Mirabel, in a ceremony attended by the then Crown Prince Felipe of Spain and his sister. 

Queen Letizia looked elegant for the occasion in a simple black shirt, teamed with tailored trousers, and she and her husband both wore face masks as they arrived at the funeral service. 

The couple have continued to put on a united front amid the ongoing scandal surrounding former King Juan Carlos.

In August, they visited Ibiza and paid a visit to the Monographic Museum and Necropolis of 'Puig des Molins', said to be the home of the goddess Tanit and the best preserved necropolis in the Mediterranean. 

Their trip coincided with the Spanish royal palace confirming the 82-year-old ex-king is residing in the United Arab Emirates, having left his homeland earlier this month after it emerged his finances are under investigation in a major corruption probe.  

Juan Carlos is believed to be staying with his 'most faithful friend for the past 40 years', 70-year-old Mallorcan interior designer Marta Gaya, in a £10,000-a-night presidential suite at the Emirates Palace Hotel. 

In a surprise move, Juan Carlos announced on August 3 that he was leaving Spain to prevent his personal affairs from undermining his son King Felipe VI's reign, but did not say where he would be going.  

King Juan Carlos has denied any wrongdoing and claims he is available should prosecutors need to interview him.
