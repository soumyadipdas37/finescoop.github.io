The Health Secretary said people should 'absolutely' tell police if they see rule breakers as he warned he could not rule out a second national lockdown if rules continued to be flouted

Matt Hancock warned today that Britain was at a 'tipping point' in its battle against a second devastating wave of coronavirus - and could not rule out putting the whole nation into a second total lockdown.

He made the stark assessment as ministers brought in fines of up to £10,000 under strict new laws on self-isolation, amid fears rules were simply being flouted.

With cases rising across the country, Mr Hancock said there was a danger the numbers could 'shoot through the roof' unless effective action was taken to halt the spread of the virus.

Despite dire warnings about the economic impact of another total lockdown, the Health Secretary said it was still an option if the measures already taken were not effective.

He told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show: 'This country faces a tipping point.

'We have a choice, and the choice is if everybody follows the rules and does the self-isolation if they need to, follows the rule of six, which is really simple and clear, and the basics, hands, face and space, then we can avoid further measures. 

'But the alternative to that choice is that we will have to bring in more action. And we don’t want to do that, but every single person has a part to play in this and everybody watching has a choice: do you follow the rules or not? And if everybody follows the rules, then we’ll be able to get the virus under control.' 

With his ministers locked in debate this weekend over whether to introduce a second lockdown that would devastate the economy, the Prime Minister announced that he was creating a new legal duty for people to self-isolate if they test positive for the virus or are told to do so by Test and Trace staff.

'I don't want to see more measures, more restrictive measures. But unfortunately if people don't follow the rules that is how the virus spreads,' Mr Hancock added.

'It comes down to individual choices of the 60million people who live in this country as to whether we can keep it there with a local lockdown approach or whether we have to take further national action.'  

The Health Secretary told Britons to grass up their neighbours if they break the rules - and admitted he would do it himself.  



With his ministers locked in debate this weekend over whether to introduce a second lockdown that would devastate the economy, the Prime Minister (pictured today at Westminster Abbey) announced that he was creating a new legal duty for people to self-isolate if they test positive for the virus or are told to do so by Test and Trace staff.

Drinkers hit the town ahead of Boris Johnson's potential plan to close pubs in England. Nottingham was packed with revellers all enjoying a night out on Saturday September 19.

The Health Secretary said people should 'absolutely' tell police if they see rule breakers as he warned he could not rule out a second national lockdown if rules continued to be flouted.

But the Government appears to be at sixes and seven over whether Britain should become a nation of narks, with contradictory views around the Cabinet.

Mr Hancock's comments were at odds with Boris Johnson's position, after the Prime Minister said last week that he did not like 'sneak culture' and urged people to inform on neighbours as a last resort, 'if there is some huge kind of Animal House party taking place ... hot tubs and so forth, and there is a serious threat to public health'.

However Home Secretary Priti Patel had earlier backed people informing on their neighbours if they were breaking the new rules, adding: 'It's not dobbing in neighbours, it's all about us taking personal responsibility.' 

Asked this morning on Sky's Ridge on Sunday if he would report a neighbour Mr Hancock said: 'Yes, and everybody should. And the reason for that is that the way we control this virus is by breaking the chains of transmission.'

Repeating this view later on the BBC's Andrew Marr show he added: 'I'm not in this for a popularity contest. I'm in this to keep the country safe.'  

The development came as:

London mayor Sadiq Khan is reportedly pressing for new coronavirus restrictions for the capital on Monday, including a 10pm pub curfew. 

Mayoral sources said the city was catching up with disease hotspots in the North West and North East of England, which have been placed under new controls.

While data from only a few days ago suggested London was two weeks behind those areas, the latest modelling seen by Mr Khan was said to show the gap had closed to two or three days.

The mayor is now urging ministers to extend the latest regional restrictions - including ordering bars and restaurants to close at 10pm - to cover the capital as well.

A mayoral source told HuffPost: 'It's clear that cases in London are only moving in one direction, we are now just days behind hotspots in the North West and North East. We can't afford more delay.

'Introducing new measures now will help slow the spread of the virus and potentially prevent the need for a fuller lockdown like we saw in March, which could seriously damage the economy once again.' 

He is also said to be looking at the possibility of asking those who are able to work from home to do so.

Such a move would be in sharp contrast to the Government, which has until recently been urging people to get back to their offices following the easing of lockdown restrictions. 

Mr Hancock added: 'If everybody follows the rules then we can avoid further national lockdowns, but we, of course, have to be prepared to take action if that's what's necessary. I don't rule it out, I don't want to see it.'

Under a 'carrot and stick' approach, four million people on low incomes who cannot work from home will receive a £500 lump sum if forced to self-isolate. 

But fines for those breaching the rules, which come into effect a week tomorrow, will start at £1,000 – rising to £10,000 for repeat offenders and 'the most egregious breaches', which would include business owners who threaten self-isolating staff with redundancy if they do not come to work.

Mr Hancock this morning told Sky's Ridge on Sunday the nation was at a 'tipping point' and there was a choice between following the current rules like the Rule of Six and self-isolation 'or we will have to take more measures'.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party supported the action that would target 'a small number' of people.

'There are a few people that are breaking the rules and something has to be done about that,' he told Ridge on Sunday.

'But it's not going to be the silver bullet ... we have a testing system that, when we need it to be effective, is barely serviceable.' 

He added that reporting neighbours for suspected breaches of the rule-of-six restrictions should be done cautiously, saying: 'It depends on the circumstances. If someone is repeatedly flouting the rules, I think all of us would want to do something about it and I think that's where the majority of people are.

'What I've seen in policing across the country is actually it being done by consent, cajoling people, getting people to do the right thing, and I think that's how we need to go forward.

'I don't disagree with the Government that in the rare cases where people are flouting the rules, something's got to be done about it, so we support them on that.'

He also warned the Prime Minister that he needed to take immediate and hard-hitting action to avoid a miserable Christmas for millions of British families.

In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, the opposition leader said: 'He has to act swiftly and decisively now to get infections under control so that Christmas is not lost.

'We were promised world-beating testing, but we haven't even got a serviceable system.

'It is astonishing that the Government didn't anticipate that we would need to boost testing when children went back to school and people went back to work.'

However reports today suggested that the PM might be prepared to relax any stringent new lockdowns over Christmas to provide some much-needed respite to families.

'The PM is anxious to avoid being portrayed as Scrooge,' a source told the Sun on Sunday.

'He's fully aware that millions of people are making big sacrifices to defeat this virus and is considering ways to allow them to experience the joy of Christmas for at last part of the holiday season.'

A second wave of coronavirus cases in Europe is not causing deaths to spike.

Although cases in Spain have soared to almost 15,000 a day – leading to a new lockdown in parts of Madrid – the number of deaths remains relatively low compared with the peak in spring. 

There were 240 deaths in Spain on Thursday – much lower than the 929 daily deaths reached in late March when there were a recorded 9,000 cases a day.



 

 

In France, another 13,498 cases were reported yesterday. But the latest 24-hour death toll – 154 on Friday – is much lower than in mid-April when there were 1,400 deaths but 5,500 confirmed cases.

The difference may be explained by an increase in testing in the countries in recent months, but could also be a sign that the virus is mainly infecting younger, healthier people who survive the illness.

Sweden, which did not impose a lockdown, continues to have a significantly lower rate of cases and deaths from Covid-19. 

On Tuesday, Sweden had its lowest number of new cases since March. In April, Covid deaths in a single day in Sweden peaked at 115. Now, some days, that figure is zero.

Reported infections have been climbing steadily across most of Europe over the past two months, with more than half of countries seeing an increase of over ten per cent in the past two weeks.

 

Plenty of people were seen in on Saturday in large crowds at Stables Market in Camden, London, and in Nottingham, where people hit the pubs before they potentially close their doors again.

Long queues were seen around Nottingham, with security having to step in and ask people to space out more due to zero social distancing going on. Police and community protection were doing patrols. 

A sharp rise in the number of cases over recent weeks has triggered alarm in Downing Street, with the Government's scientific advisers pushing for a 'circuit breaking' second lockdown – but Ministers led by Chancellor Rishi Sunak are warning of the devastating economic impact.

A No 10 source admitted last night: 'It's not looking good.'

In a carefully choreographed move, the advisers, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, are expected to release data showing the rise in cases at a public event tomorrow.

Mr Johnson could then make a televised appearance on Tuesday to set out new measures.

The extent, and the duration, of the new rules are still being discussed by Ministers, but are likely to include a nationwide curfew on pubs and a ban on the mixing of households.

Meanwhile senior Tories are planning to try to stop ministers imposing new coronavirus lockdown restrictions without the say of Parliament.

Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the powerful Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, has said he intends to table an amendment which would require the Government to put any new measures to a vote of MPs.

The move comes as Boris Johnson announced that anyone in England who refuses to obey an order to self-isolate could face a fine of up to £10,000.

Sir Graham told The Sunday Telegraph that he would take the opportunity to seek to amend the legislation when the Government comes to renew the emergency powers in the Coronavirus Act 2020.

The move is likely to attract significant support from Conservative MPs unhappy at the extensive powers taken by ministers with little or no parliamentary scrutiny.

Sir Graham told the Telegraph: 'In March, Parliament gave the Government sweeping emergency powers at a time when Parliament was about to go into recess and there was realistic concern that NHS care capacity might be overwhelmed by Covid-19.

'We now know that the NHS coped well with the challenge of the virus and Parliament has been sitting largely since April. There is now no justification for ministers ruling by emergency powers without reference to normal democratic processes.

'It is essential that going forward all of these massively important decisions for family life, and affecting people's jobs and businesses should be exercised with proper supervision and control.'

Mr Hancock said the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus was rising and would be followed by an increase in the number of deaths.

'We have seen in other countries when the case rate shoots up, the next thing that happens is the numbers going into hospital shoot up,' he told Marr.

'Sadly, we have seen that rise, it is doubling every eight days or so - people going into hospital - then, with a lag, you see the number of people dying sadly rise.'

But he added that it is still possible that there could be a coronavirus vaccine before the end of the year.

'There is still hope that we will get one of the vaccines over the line this year. The Oxford vaccine is still at the front of the queue. More likely is next year, and probably the early part of next year.

'We have got the cavalry coming over the next few months - the vaccine, the mass testing and the improvements in treatments - but we have got to all follow the rules between now and then to keep people safe.' 

The Prime Minister said last night: 'The best way we can fight this virus is by everyone following the rules and self-isolating if they're at risk of passing on coronavirus. 

'And so nobody underestimates just how important this is, new regulations will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus or have been asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.

'People who choose to ignore the rules will face significant fines.

Rishi Sunak is considering a freeze on benefits and public sector pay as he tries to get a grip on the spiralling cost of the coronavirus pandemic – and boost his own political ambitions.

With unemployment projected to rise to more than four million as a result of the crisis, the Chancellor has told fellow Ministers that he is deeply concerned about the long-term damage to the Treasury's balance sheet.

In an attempt to claw back billions of pounds in economic bailouts, Mr Sunak has discussed scrapping inflation-linked increases to both welfare payments and public sector salaries – and is trying to persuade Boris Johnson to rip up the 'triple lock' which protects the income of pensioners.

It comes as Mr Sunak – whose public poll ratings during the pandemic have outstripped his colleagues, including the Prime Minister – has been making increasingly energetic efforts to meet 'Red Wall' MPs who entered Parliament in the 2019 Election to set out his political priorities.

This has led to mutterings on the Tory backbenches about the growing strength – and independence – of Mr Sunak's operation.

Treasury staff are becoming increasingly outspoken about Downing Street's grip on the Covid crisis, with Boris Johnson's 'Operation Moonshot' plan to mass test ten million people a day by 2021 dismissively referred to in the department as a 'Moonf***' moneypit.

Mr Sunak has been the most hawkish Minister in the Government over the need to reopen the economy as quickly as possible, in the face of opposition from Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Government scientific advisers, led by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty.

 



'We need to do all we can to control the spread of this virus, to prevent the most vulnerable people from becoming infected, and to protect the NHS and save lives'.

Under the new rules, Test and Trace call handlers will make regular contact with those self-isolating and will pass on suspicions about those breaking the rules to local authorities and the police. 

But one Government adviser, Professor Robert Dingwall, argued that it would be premature to reintroduce tougher measures, especially as existing rules have become 'unenforceable' because people do not buy into the spirit of the restrictions.

'There is a sense among some of the scientific advisers that the Government is perhaps jumping the gun,' he said. 

'It's a bit premature to say that we're on this exponential growth curve when we may just be drifting up to a stable situation at a slightly higher level than we were a few weeks ago, which you would expect with the re-opening of the economy.'

Prof Dingwall also asked whether 'we are drifting towards a situation where people are quite comfortable with the idea that 20,000 people will die every year from Covid as we are comfortable with the idea that 20,000 people will die every year from influenza. And we shrug our shoulders and get on with our lives.

'We need to be having more of a national conversation that starts from the lives of ordinary people and what is practical to achieve, and what the costs of these measures are.' 

Professor Carl Heneghan, director for the centre of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, told Sky News the country cannot afford to introduce 'harsh measures' immediately to curb the spread of Covid-19, adding: 'What we have to do now is slow down, this is a long winter.'

He said: 'What we're seeing is that the virus is operating in a seasonal way.

'As we've gone back to schools, actually what's happened now is we've seen about a 60% increase in consultations for all the acute respiratory infections and that's what's driving the problems in the Test and Trace programme.

'All the young children who have coughs and colds and these infections, one is called rhinovirus.

'As we look at the data, Covid is operating in a similar seasonal way, and mirroring those respiratory infections, so what we have to do now is slow down, this is a long winter.

'We can't afford to go now with harsh measures ... the impact on the economy here is going to be significant.

'What happens is as soon as you pause and then open up again, it tends to come back.

'We still have to be vigilant about ensuring the infections stay manageable across the board.' 

Professor Heneghan added: 'There's no evidence right now of what's called a second wave.'

Asked if Prime Minister Boris Johnson was wrong in that assertion, he told Sky News: 'I get for our ministers this is an incredibly complicated area, some of the issues we're talking about require five or six years of healthcare experience to really get your head around.

'This is about good advice, to the Prime Minister, to the Health Secretary, that allows a wider range of expertise to come on board, and if they did that they might look at the problem slightly different.

'I think over the next few weeks if we can see a slower, analytical approach to the data, and a different approach to the advice, the Prime Minister might see a subtle change in his language that reflects a need to normalise what's going on.

'This is a seasonal effect now, if it becomes worse and it impacts on disease, then, yes, that's the point when we have restrictive measures, but that time is not now.'

Sir Keir Starmer is urging ministers to put children 'at the front of the queue' for coronavirus tests.

The Labour leader warned of a 'flood' of school closures unless pupils were able to get the tests they needed.

His call came amid reports that 350 schools in England and Wales were forced to close completely or to send children home last week following positive Covid-19 tests.

Sir Keir said it was essential that children whose schooling was disrupted by the lockdown did not lose out even more because a shortage of tests meant they were unable to return to the classroom.

'If the Prime Minister does not get a grip of the testing crisis, children will be robbed of an education. We are seeing a growing flood of schools closures,' he said.

'The testing regime is not working, nor does it appreciate the unique challenges many families are having to cope with.

'That is why I'm urging the Prime Minister, like our key workers, to put children at the front of the queue for testing. To this week give parents a cast iron guarantee that they can get their child a test within 24 hours and the result back 24 hours later.'

 

Has the second wave of panic-buying begun? Ocado and Sainsbury's warn delivery slots are booking up fast as Britain braces for second lockdown 

By EMER SCULLY for MailOnline 

Ocado and Sainsbury's have warned customers that delivery slots are booking up fast - as fears of a second wave appear to be fuelling the return of panic-buying.

The online supermarkets pasted notices on their 'pick a slot' page warning customers the sites were experiencing high demand.

Ocado's read: 'Delivery slots are selling out faster than usual. If you can't find a slot now, please use the 'Next 3 days' button to see available slots further in advance.'

It comes as Government scientists spooked Boris Johnson with warnings of hundreds of daily coronavirus deaths 'within weeks' as they said: 'There is no alternative to a second national lockdown'.

A notice on Sainsbury's delivery slots page said: 'Slots are still in high demand. We have been working hard to expand our service.  More slots are now available and we are able to offer some of them to other customers. 

'Customers who are vulnerable will get priority access and are able to book slots in advance of anyone else. We're releasing new slots regularly so please check back if you can't see any available.'

Meanwhile Tesco was fully booked until Wednesday with an available slots all priced at £5.50 - and there were no available spaces until Monday at Asda.

The Prime Minister is now threatening to 'intensify' coronavirus restrictions as he blames the British public for the rise in cases - despite his repeated pleas for people to return to their desks and eat out at pubs and restaurants in a bid to resuscitate Britain's economy. 

It has led to concerns the nation could return to the days of panic shopping seen at the beginning of the pandemic in March. 

On March 19 shoppers formed queues outside supermarkets up and down the country from 6am and stripped shelves bare by 9am.

And Ocado was forced to shut down its website and app on March 18 after being swamped with orders. 

Customers were not be able to book a new delivery or edit existing orders. 

It comes as the Prime Minister looks to ditch his Rule of Six and introduce fortnight-long 'circuit breakers' nationwide for six months, following claims that it was 'inevitable' that a second wave would hit the country last night.

The new approach to get the UK through winter would see it alternate periods of stricter measures, including bans on all social contact between households and shutting down hospitality and leisure venues like bars and restaurants, with intervals of relaxation. Schools will be shut as a 'last resort', a Whitehall source claimed.

It is understood that the new 'circuit break' shutdown could be announced via television press conference on Tuesday, in a move reminiscent of the Government's behaviour during the peak of the pandemic.  

Visiting the Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre construction site near Oxford, Mr Johnson said: 'What I can certainly say about parents and schools is we want to keep the schools open, that is going to happen.

'We want to try and keep all parts of the economy open as far as we possibly can - I don't think anybody wants to go into a second lockdown but clearly when you look at what is happening, you have got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we have brought in on Monday, so we will be looking at the local lockdowns we have got in large parts of the country now, looking at what we can do to intensify things that help bring the rate of infection down there, but also looking at other measures as well.' 

Officials, including England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, are thought to be arguing for tough restrictions as panic within official circles grows. 

Today the Government's original lockdown architect, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, recommended 'rolling back' freedoms 'sooner rather than later' by 'reducing contact rates between people'.  

The epidemiologist, who was sacked from SAGE for flouting his own lockdown rules, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Right now we're at about the levels of infections that we were seeing in late February, if we leave it at another two to four weeks we will be back at levels we were seeing more like mid March.

'That's going to clearly cause deaths... I think some additional measures are likely to be needed sooner rather than later, the timing of any more intensive policy, temporary policy, is open to question'. 

But the measures are thought to have been met with protests from Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has warned against introducing new blanket restrictions by pointing to huge damage already inflicted to the economy.

Government sources claim that Mr Sunak gave 'sombre warnings' to the Prime Minister as he highlighted the severity of the damage caused to the UK economy as a result of the March lockdown - while Mr Johnson shrugged off the 'grim' economic forecasts, claiming that 'he was confident it will all be OK in the end'.  

Business leaders echoed the Chancellor's concerns and warned that a second lockdown would tank the economy, with the British Chambers of Commerce saying: 'Uncertainty and speculation around future national restrictions will sap business and consumer confidence at a delicate moment for the economy'.
