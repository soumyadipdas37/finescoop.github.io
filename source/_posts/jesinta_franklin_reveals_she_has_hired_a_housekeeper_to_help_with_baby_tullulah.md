Jesinta Franklin has her hands full at the moment.

The 28-year-old model is looking after her six month old daughter, Tullulah, in Sydney while her husband, Lance 'Buddy' Franklin, stays in the's AFL quarantine hub in Queensland.

She told The Morning Show on Wednesday that it was 'a juggle' without having Buddy, 33, around but she was being supported by her family.

'For the first five weeks, I went to the Gold Coast before the borders closed to be with mum and dad,' she said.

'I could not see how I could juggle work and Tullulah and everything that comes with everyday life without Buddy there to help out.'  

The former Miss Universe Australia has since returned to Sydney, and admitted that she and Tullulah were 'really missing Buddy'.

But the mother of one has been getting some help since returning home. 

'I proudly say that my little girl is home with my sister now, and I had a housekeeper come in on Monday to help me with the washing, and I'm having my dinners delivered,' she said.

'I certainly cannot do it all - and I think the expectation or that thought that we can just puts so much pressure on us as women.'

It comes after Jesinta opened up about the struggles of becoming a mother in an interview with Body + Soul on Sunday.

She explained that the difficulties she had breastfeeding left her feeling 'wrecked'.

'I was so exhausted, my body was wrecked and, mentally, there were so many tears,' she said. 

'I was encouraged to still pump because I was told that one teaspoon of breast milk a day was better than nothing. I'd torture myself to get even half a teaspoon.'
