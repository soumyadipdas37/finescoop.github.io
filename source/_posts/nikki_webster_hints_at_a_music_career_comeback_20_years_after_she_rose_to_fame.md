Nikki Webster rose to fame at 13, after she performed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. 

And on Monday, the 33-year-old Australian singer revealed fans can expect to be hearing more of her music soon.

Speaking to Nova's The Babble Nikki said: 'I have recorded music, I've recorded a whole album that I love and it's great fun, but I just haven't released it yet.'

The Strawberry Kisses hitmaker described her new sound as 'fun'.

'It's fun, it's pop, it was [written] at a good time in my life... with some writers over in Nashville,' she explained.

'I went to write one song, and just ended up completing a whole album, so I do have music there it's just how to release it and when.'

Blast from the past! Nikki released her last single, Devilicious, in May 2009, but has not dropped an album since 2004's Let's Dance

Nikki became a child star after singing at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, and went on to release hit single Strawberry Kisses later that year.

Last month, the singer shared adorable photos to Instagram of six-year-old daughter Skylah wearing her iconic pink frock.

Skylah looked just like her famous mother did many years ago, as she posed in the signature outfit. 

'20 years on from Sydney 2000 and I can no longer fit into the dress but someone else can!' Nikki captioned the sweet post.

Skylah wore her curly long blonde locks in pigtails with pink butterfly clips, adding to the likeness of Nikki's stellar look.
