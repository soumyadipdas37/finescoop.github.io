On Friday, the network shared a promotional photo of the judges of the US version of the show to Instagram.

'Keen for more Masked Singer? We've got you covered! The Masked Singer US is heading to 10 play from Thursday October 1st,' the captioned read.

Emerging from the costume, actress Bonnie said she was excited to return to singing after a stint on television.  

'I haven't really been singing for a while, you know. Neighbours has kind of taken a lot of my time, so it has kind of sparked up a little bit of fire in me,' she said. 

Bonnie added that she struggled to keep her identity hidden from friends and family.

'It's very hard to lie on this show, I tell you. All of my family, my friends, all of you watching, were bugging me. 

'I'm a terrible liar but I think my acting skills came in to play. It's a good feeling and I can't believe that I won this thing!' she concluded excitedly. 

Continuing her winning streak, judge Dannii Minogue yet again guessed right, after disagreeing with Dave Hughes who was long convinced it was Jessica Mauboy.
