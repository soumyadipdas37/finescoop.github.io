She's a former Apprentice star known for flaunting her incredible physique.

And Luisa Zissman was at it again on Friday night as she was spotted arriving at a five-star hotel in Mayfair, London.

The entrepreneur, 33, displayed her toned figure in a plunging beige knitted vest top which she teamed with ripped denim jeans.

Luisa finished her low-key look with metallic trainers and sparkly silver jewellery for her night on the town.

The former Apprentice star styled her brunette locks into a curly blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up. 

Later in the night, Luisa took to her Instagram to document her fun evening out which included espresso martinis.

The star changed into a plunging floral green dress with long sleeves which highlighted her ample assets.

In June, Luisa shared a throwback picture of the wedding dress she wore for her legal ceremony in Dublin to husband Andrew Collins five years ago.

Luisa took to Instagram to post the snap, in celebration of their wedding anniversary, showing off her short tiered gown she wore on the day. 

The wedding was an intimate affair and they had a second ceremony in Cannes a month later, with Luisa wearing the short dress again for her evening reception.

Luisa wore a diamanté tiara and lace veil for her Dublin wedding and wore light-coloured shoes with a strap detail.  

She wrote: '5yrs ago today we got married in a little church ⛪️ in Dublin with just our families there ❤️.' 

Luisa and Andrew first laid eyes on each other when the Irish millionaire bid on her at a charity auction, where they raised over £3,000 for charity.  

She began dating Andrew shortly after her marriage to Oliver Zissman broke down and he popped the question in October 2014 on a romantic trip to Paris.

He gave her an eight-carat diamond ring during an intimate candlelit dinner with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

Luisa is mother to Dixie, 10, with her ex-husband Oliver and Indigo Esme, three, and Clementine, two, with Andrew.
