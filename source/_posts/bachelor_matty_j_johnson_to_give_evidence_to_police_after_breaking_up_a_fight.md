The Bachelor's Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson and Laura Byrne recently returned from a family holiday in Byron Bay with their one-year-old daughter Marlie Mae.   

And on Saturday, Matty revealed that their final day in the NSW coastal town ended in a very dramatic fashion.  

On Nova's Matt, Sarah and Matty J show, the 33-year-old explained that he broke up a fight after two young guys tackled an elderly couple.

'I’m looking around, the park is really busy, everyone is frozen and shocked,' he said. 

'I dropped my phone and start running full pelt, running, there is not a thought in my mind, I just know I have to save this couple. I tackled the guy, I bring him to the ground…I had him pinned to the ground.' 

He continued: 'Next thing I’ve got one guy pinned to the ground, I’m holding another one back and everyone’s come over, the police have arrived.' 

To the rescue: Thankfully the radio host came out of the skirmish unharmed, however he did reveal that he will have to give evidence to the police

On Thursday, Matty and his wife Laura announced that they are expecting their second child together. 

'Marlie-Mae learning shocked face couldn't have been timed any better.. WE'RE HAVING A BABY!' Matty, 32, wrote alongside a family photo on Instagram.

'Please brace yourself for twice the amount of dad jokes,' he added.

'I reckon we've kept this little beach ball under wraps for long enough..... Halfway to number 2,' Laura, 31, wrote in a separate post shared to her own account.

'A big shout out to @matthewdavidjohnson for his contribution,' she cheekily added.

'You’re hands down my favourite Bachelor, I love you forever and our little family.'
