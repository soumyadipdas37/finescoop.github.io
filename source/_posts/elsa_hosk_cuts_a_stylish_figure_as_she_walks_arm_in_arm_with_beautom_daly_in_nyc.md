She recently listed her stunning two bedroom, two bathroom apartment in Soho for $3,500,000.

And Elsa Hosk was spotted out in New York City on Saturday morning with longtime beau Tom Daly. 

The 31-year-old Swedish supermodel walked arm in arm with Tom as they leisurely strolled down the sidewalk.

Elsa cut a stylish figure in an oversized leather jacket that she layered over a plain white tee. 

She showcases her slender legs in a pair of skinny trousers that flared slightly towards the bottom.

The Victoria's Secret Angel slipped her feet into a pair of black patent leather oxfords that featured treaded, platform soles.

To complete her off duty model look, Hosk threw on some chic shades and stowed her belongings in a white designer handbag.

Elsa's boyfriend of five-years rocked a trendy denim-on-denim ensemble that included a fleece lined jacket and a pair of distressed jeans.

Elsa and Tom, who began dating in 2015, each did their due diligence by donning face mask during their outing in the city.

Hosk gave her 6.2million Instagram followers a peek into her lockdown life on Saturday by sharing a few throwback photos that she took at the 'beginning of quarantine.'

Earlier this week, Elsa enlisted the help of Carl Gambino and Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group to get her 1,750-square-foot property in Soho on the market.

Hosk's 'rare gem' of an abode is nestled in a charming pre-war building amid the world class restaurants and shops of Soho’s famous Cast Iron Historic District.

According to the official listing, the thoughtfully laid-out apartment was designed in tandem by Alveary Architecture and current owner, Elsa Hosk, with the aim of maximizing its square footage. It was also featured in Architectural Digest.

The first floor of the apartment features a pair of original Corinthian columns, Danish wide-plank Douglas wood floors, and exposed brick that artfully clash with the white walls that dominate the space.

The master bedroom happens to be situated directly above the kitchen and is 'situated within a steel structure mezzanine level with a wall of operable windows that overlook the loft space,' as the listing describes.

For those looking to host guests, the apartment also has a decent sized second bedroom that includes a walk-in closet and its own private bathroom.
