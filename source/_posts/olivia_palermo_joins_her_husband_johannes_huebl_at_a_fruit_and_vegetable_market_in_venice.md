She was seen hitting all the hottest Milan Fashion Week shows. 

Yet Olivia Palermo had moved on from the fashion capital as she was spotted at a Venice fruit and vegetable market with her husband Johannes Huebl, 42. 

The eternal fashionista, 34, looked sensational in a white shirt with a statement checked coat over the top as she inspected the local delicacies.

Olivia seldom puts a fashion foot wrong and on Wednesday she was again perfecting her chic ensemble in the white shirt and black trousers. 

Know for her classic stylings, the stunner went for muted tones to allow the statement - her green and black coat - take centre stage. 

She shielded her face with a pair of oversized sunglasses while putting safety first with a facial covering over her mouth and nose.  

Olivia has also been actively advising her 6.4 million Instagram followers to 'wear a damn mask' or 'scarf, or like me a combination of both!'

She said on social media in August: 'However you choose to style your mask, wear one that covers your mouth and nose to help protect yourself and others.'

Olivia rose to fame starring alongside Whitney Port in The City, a New York-based spin-off of the popular MTV reality program, The Hills. 

She has been married to German model Johannes since 2014.   

She has just departed Milan, which is only one of the four fashion capitals that hosted the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the pandemic.

The city hosted 23 shows- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks. 

Paris has 20 scheduled shows planned this week but coveted guestlists have been reduced dramatically, in keeping with strict socially distancing guidelines.  

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus. 

Back in February, Georgio Armani cancelled his show in Milan as the virus began to sweep through the country.
