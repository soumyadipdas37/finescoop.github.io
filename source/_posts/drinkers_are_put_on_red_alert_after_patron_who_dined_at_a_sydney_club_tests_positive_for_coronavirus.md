 A club in Sydney's southwest is closed for cleaning after it was recently visited by a person with COVID-19, NSW Health says.

The infectious person dined at the Moorebank Sports Club at Hammondville on the evening of September 14.

Anyone who attended the club needs to monitor themselves for symptoms, and if they appear, get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.

NSW Health is working with the venue to identify people who were at the club at the time and contact patrons to identify close contacts.

Anyone identified as a close contact must immediately self-isolate, get tested and remain isolated for 14 days even if a negative result is received.

Meanwhile, the NSW government has announced its plan for a COVID-safe summer, telling beachgoers to keep a towel length between themselves and others.

The plan encourages more outdoor dining and safe distancing will be marked out in parks and some public spaces from next month.

At the same time, COVID-safe summer program of events will be launched in outdoor areas to encourage people to get out and about safely.

Meanwhile, a coronavirus infection in a Sydney taxi driver could delay South Australia lifting border restrictions with NSW.

The state's health officials have sought details from NSW ahead of a meeting on Tuesday to consider lifting the 14-day quarantine requirement.

But any decision could now be delayed until Friday or later.

NSW Health is trying to contact anyone who took trips with the Silver Service taxi driver, who tested positive on Saturday and worked in Sydney's west and southwest.

The critical dates are September 8 to 18.

While a large number of people who rode with that driver have already been identified, the names of nine passengers is still unknown. It's likely they hailed the cab on the street.

NSW reported four new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday, including three returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one case that was locally acquired.

That person had already been in self-isolation because they were a close contact of an infected person linked to the Concord Hospital cluster in Sydney.
