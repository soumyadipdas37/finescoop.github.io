The New Jersey-born pop star certainly looked leggy in a blue silk blouse, black PVC short shorts, and matching pumps for her special day.

Halsey made sure to protect herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a matching blue mask, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for public outings on June 18.

'I really was born at 9:29am on nine twenty-nine,' she wrote. 'You think I'm lying but I'm being dead serious. Okay, I'll prove it.' 

The camera then pans over a pink-lit room that features a rocking horse, a baby's crib, stacks of books, and various other furnishings throughout it.

A video of Halsey's family photos being tossed into a pile is then projected on top of the items in the little girl's bedroom before the video, itself, overtakes the screen.  

The audience is first treated to video footage of a much younger Halsey posing on the porch of her house in a white baptism dress, before launching into a full on montage.
