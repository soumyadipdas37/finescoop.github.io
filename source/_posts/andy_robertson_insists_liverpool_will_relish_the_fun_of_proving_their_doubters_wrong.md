Andy Robertson insists Liverpool will relish the 'fun' of proving doubters wrong to retain the Premier League title.

The Merseyside club landed their first top flight title in 30 years last season but some have suggested they will struggle to repeat the feat this campaign. 

The Reds made an emphatic statement of their intent to retain their crown on Friday after confirming the signing of Thiago from Bayern Munich as well as agreeing a fee with Wolves for Diogo Jota.

The Scottish full-back — an integral part of the club's recent success — says new arrivals are always welcome but he believes they already have a squad capable of fighting for all trophies available this season. 

'If the club buys players it will be to improve the squad. That is always welcomed', Robertson told the Guardian.

'And if they don't we have a squad that can compete on all fronts. That is what we believe. We have a squad with young lads who are getting better every day. Our squad can compete for the four trophies we are going for.'

Despite Liverpool's exceptional last campaign, Manchester City are the popular choice of many to regain their Premier League crown once again this season.

But Robertson insisted Liverpool are at their best when they are proving doubters wrong. They secured the title a year after missing out on it by one point, while also winning the Champions League a year after losing the 2018 final.

'Every season we've been questioned. When we lost the Champions League final everyone thought: "Will they be back or was it a one-off season?" The next season we won the Champions League and just fell short in the Premier League. Even then people said: "If they didn't beat Man City this season, they're never going to beat them," because of how well we'd done. The following season we went and proved it.

'We've got doubters again, of course we do. We've got people that are backing different teams and that's part of the fun of it. We're not going to change the way we think or the way we go about our business. It's worked quite successfully the last three seasons so why would we change our ways?'

Brazilian star Thiago is bound to add quality to an already high-performing midfield, while the imminent £41million signing of the talented Jota will add strength in depth to their ruthless front line.

Liverpool began their title defence with a narrow 4-3 victory against Leeds last week, while they travel to face a new-look Chelsea side on Sunday.
