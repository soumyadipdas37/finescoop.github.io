She recently began shooting season 17 of her long-standing hit show Grey's Anatomy, which has made her one of the highest-paid actresses on television.  

But on Wednesday Ellen Pompeo was seen taking some time for herself as she went for a stroll out in Los Angeles to get some exercise.  

The 50-year-old actress cut an athletic figure for her midweek walk as she chatted with a friend while enjoying the fresh air. 

Walk and talk: Ellen Pompeo, 50, cuts an athletic figure as she goes for a stroll in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The high paying television actress took a break from filming season 17 of Grey's Anatomy to get in a midweek walk and catch up with friends

For the athletic outing, Ellen dressed down in a pair of black leggings with mesh detailing on the side that showed off her slim legs. 

Despite making a reported $20M a year for her role as Meredith Grey, the actress sported an old ripped white T-shirt that she layered over a black sports bra. 

The Station 19 actress capped off her look with a pair of grey Adidas running shoes and a black face mask, wearing her blonde locks down. 

She carried her cellphone in hand and opted for a natural face free from makeup.

Though incredibly grateful for her long television career, Pompeo recently spoke to Dax Shepard on his podcast Armchair Expert about her time on Grey's Anatomy and what the future holds. 

First making waves as Meredith Grey in 2005, the actress revealed that she hated medical dramas before landing her role on the ABC hit show. 

The shows 15 year run has awarded her incredible success but has also given her a lot to think about. 

'Certainly, I think to dip out sooner rather than later at this point, having done what we've done, to leave while the show is still on top is definitely a goal' she said. 

Meredith Grey: Before landing her role as lead Dr. Grey on the show, Pompeo revealed that she had previously hated medical dramas. Now in its 17th season the show has made Ellen a household name and one of the highest paid TV actresses 

The star also added that though she does not lie to herself when it comes to her age, she has had a hard time watching herself go from 33 to 50 on the screen. 

The show - which kicked off it's 17th season of production just a few weeks back - will be returning to television on November 12th for perhaps its most highly anticipated season yet. 

Taking to instagram to announce the news, the actress posted '2020 has given us another seasons' worth of stories to tell' before adding 'when lifes gives you lemons...' 

The actress posted an onset selfie with fellow actor Richard Flood as she addressed filming a show about frontline workers, in the midst of a pandemic that has seen so many lives lost.  

Gratitude: The Station 19 star took to Instagram to share her sadness over the loss of so many healthcare workers due to the pandemic 

'I dedicate my season 17 to all who have fallen and to everyone of you who by the grace of God is still standing...the season is for you with humility and a bit of humor to get us through and endless amounts of gratitude' she said.  

When a fan on twitter asked if the new season would be about the COVID-19 pandemic, Pompeo responded, 'Yes the biggest medical crisis the world has ever seen? Yes we are meeting the moment and telling some stories'.

The mother of three who shares her children with husband Chris Ivery, 53, has also been very outspoken on all matters of social justice, including the need for more diversity on set. 

Pompeo and Ivery who have been married 13 years share children Stella, 10, Sienna, six, and son Eli, three.  

Still kicking: Though she has said she would rather leave the show sooner than later, Pompeo conveyed gratitude when it comes to being able to bring stories of the COVID-19 pandemic to light on the upcoming season of Grey's Anatomy; seen in 2019
