Speaking about his memories of meeting John, Sir Paul said: 'I look back on it now like a fan, how lucky was I to meet this strange teddy boy off the bus, who played music like I did and we get together and boy, we complemented each other!'

However the Hey Jude hitmaker revealed that 'there were a few songs that weren't very good' during his writing partnership with John. 

He added: 'There were a few songs that weren't very good… you know, clearly young songwriters who don't know how to do it'.

Sir Paul picked up his guitar during the interview and played an example of a Lennon-McCartney track called Just Fun which they never recorded.  

'Eventually, we started to write slightly better songs and then enjoyed the process of learning together so much that it really took off,' he continued. 

Speaking about the Let It Be period, the Beatles' final studio album, Sir Paul revealed that he always believed it was a gloomy time until he saw a picture taken by his late wife Linda that reminded him of the strength of their friendship.

He said: 'Wait a minute, there's this guy 'John Lennon' who's like a genius, clever, witty, confident, and everything why would he have insecurities? Because we're all fragile beings.'
