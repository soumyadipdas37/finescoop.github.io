Torrential rain is set to batter huge swathes of Australia in the coming days, before temperatures soar during an unexpected heatwave over the public holiday long weekend. 

Thunderstorms are brewing across most of the country with a low pressure trough triggering windy weather and showers throughout Australia's east coast from Tuesday.

Weatherzone meteorologist Sam Brown warned the 'severe' storms would bring 'damaging wind gusts' from Tuesday onwards.    

'There is a low pressure system and associated trough moving through South Australia at the moment and that's causing storms in the northern parts.   

'That same system is moving further east into tomorrow and there will be storms for central north New South Wales from about tomorrow morning,' he explained. 

A low pressure system will move through South Australia on Tuesday and bring severe winds an heavy rain to the country's east coast on Wednesday (a rainy day in Sydney pictured) 

Thunderstorms and gusty winds will largely affect parts of southern Queensland, eastern New South Wales and southern Victoria (Melbourne pictured on September 22) 

Mr Brown said the storms would progress over Victoria, NSW and south Queensland until Friday. 

'There will be thunderstorms for much of eastern New South Wales and there'll be showers associated with all those storms and some gusty winds,' he said. 

He explained there was 'storm potential' across most of the country thanks to the 'unstable atmosphere and temperatures coming down from the tropics.'    

Mr Brown said parts of Western Australia would also experience the wet weather. 

'They'll get a few storms in the far south west and far east near the South Australian border.  

'There's potential for storms everyday in the north of Western Australia in the Kimberley region and western parts of the top end,' he explained.   

The Bureau of Meteorology's Diana Eadie told Daily Mail Australia the system would bring 'wide-spread shower and storm activity.'

Heavy rainfall will batter South Australia on Tuesday (low pressure trough across Australia pictured) and is expected to fall at 5 to 15 mm but could be as high as 60 mm

Wide-spread shower and storm activity will hit Sydney (city pictured) on Wednesday 

Meteorologists said the 'shower, storm and rain activity' would subside across the east coast (Sydney Harbour pictured) and spark sunny weather and a mini heatwave on the weekend 

'The low pressure trough will move through eastern parts of Western Australia, southern parts of the northern territory and South Australia,' she said. 

Ms Eadie explained South Australia would see 'the most significant rainfall totals' on Tuesday.   

'We're expecting 5 to 15 millimetres but we could see as high at 40 to 60 millimetres in far north western parts of South Australia.'

She said the system and its 'shower, storm and rain activity' would progress eastwards on Wednesday.   

'We will see an increase in shower and storm activity over southern Queensland, much of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. 

Temperatures will climb across the east coast (Bondi Beach in Sydney pictured) on Friday and reach up to ten to twelve degrees above average for the time of the year

Melbourne and Sydney (Bondi Beach pictured) will both reach 28C on the long weekend  

'That will all subside on Friday and we're likely to see a pretty much sunny day across most of the country and warm conditions,' she said.  

Ms Eadie said east coast residents would 'be enjoying sunny weather' over the weekend and Labour Day public holiday on Monday. 

'Saturday will be the warmest day for the southeast and we'll see temperatures up to ten to 12 degrees above average for this time of year.' 

'It's pretty unusual, Melbourne will be 28C on Saturday and Sydney will be 26C on Saturday and 28C on Sunday,' she explained. 

Mr Brown added 'central and southern parts of NSW' would be dry and regional parts of the state would see temperatures into he low thirties over the weekend.
