The former executive producer of Studio 10 has slammed the show's new format hosted by Irish dancer Tristan MacManus, saying the relaunch is dead in the water after just one episode.

Rob McKnight, who oversaw day-to-day operations of Studio 10 from 2013 to 2017, said on his TV Blackbox podcast that Monday's episode was 'lazy, boring television'. 

'What I saw today had the depth of a puddle,' he began.

McKnight refrained from criticising Tristan on his first day as co-anchor, he said that Studio 10's long-serving producers should hang their heads in shame. 

'This isn't early days for the producers. The producers have been doing that show, some of them, for seven years,' he said.

'When they produced this show today [Monday] they would have known all eyes were on them and it was lazy, boring television. 

Beyond hope: Rob McKnight, who oversaw day-to-day operations of Studio 10 from 2013 to 2017, said on his TV Blackbox podcast that Monday's episode was 'lazy, boring television'

'It was embarrassing. I swear to god, I wish that they had renamed the show because as far as I'm concerned Studio 10 is dead.'

McKnight said that Studio 10 was beyond saving after Monday's 'horrible' relaunch.

'No amount of reproducing or fixing up or "giving time to breathe" is going to fix that,' he stated bluntly. 

'A piece of s**t, no matter how much you roll it in glitter is a piece of s**t. It was woeful.'

'I'm not watching without Joe!' Channel 10 took steps to delete negative Facebook comments about the show on Monday, but there was nothing they could do about the blistering tweets

McKnight, who was sacked from Studio 10 three years ago, acknowledged on the podcast that some people might accuse him of being bitter.

But he insisted that his opinion was valid, arguing that the content on Monday's episode was boring and safe.

'All I will say is that content wise, the only things they're allowing them to talk about are viral videos, crocheted hats and Tristan's parents,' he said.

'They've decided they don't want to talk about actual news - that's fine, that's a creative choice they've made - but they're relying on two people to sit on a couch for four hours to chat, and there's nothing to chat about.'

Studio 10 executives are believed to be avoiding 'hot topics' segments going forward after a string of controversies involving former panellist Kerri-Anne Kennerley.

While this approach may keep Channel 10's advertisers happy, it has resulted in an bland presentation and a notable lack of news content.

It comes after many viewers criticised the revamped format on Twitter, and begged producers to bring back ex-host Joe Hildebrand.

The network took steps to delete negative Facebook comments about the show on Monday, but there was nothing they could do about the blistering tweets.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.
