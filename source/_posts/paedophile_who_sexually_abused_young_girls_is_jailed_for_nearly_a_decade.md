A Victorian man who sexually abused teenage girls and paid one $10 to keep quiet has been jailed for nearly a decade.

Edmund Akkary began sending one of his victims explicit text messages and showed her pornography when she was just 13 years old.

At one point, he bought her McDonald's and tried to grab her breast before paying her $10 so she wouldn't tell her mother.

Akkary later gave the girl $20 and said they would 'do things' together.

The 33-year-old abused four girls, aged from 12 to 16, in regional Victoria between 2014 and 2017.

He was jailed in the County Court on Thursday for nine-and-a-half years.

He earlier pleaded guilty to seven charges, including four counts of an indecent act with or in the presence of a child under 16.

Akkary also admitted sexually penetrating, sexually assaulting and grooming children under 16.

He told one girl she had 'nice boobs' and squeezed her buttocks, but denied it when she complained.

One of the Akkary's victims told the court she felt disgusted, depressed, angry and unable to trust other people.

She said she was exhausted from trying to be strong and hide her hurt behind a smile.

Another suffered nightmares and flashbacks.

Judge Frances Hogan described Akkary's actions as creepy, salacious, abhorrent and offensive.

She said he appeared to have no control over his compulsive, impulsive behaviour.

Akkary has a mild intellectual disability, with an IQ of 73, and can only read to a year five level.

He also has a severe spinal injury and needs a walker.

The court was told he turned to children because he found them non-threatening.

He'd lived a sad and socially isolated life, falling through the cracks of the system after being abandoned by his mother at the age of two.

Despite pleading guilty, Akkary was reluctant to take full responsibility for his abuse and only said it was inappropriate.

He cried as he was ordered to serve five-and-a-half years of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole.
