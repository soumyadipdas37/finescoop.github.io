Christine Lampard appeared in a cheerful mood as she stepped out in casual ensemble London on Thursday.

The Loose Women star, 41, flashed a broad smile as she ran errands while her luxurious £150k Mercedes G-Wagon was washed by a trio of helpers.

It was clearly a busy day for the Northern Irish beauty as she was laden down with several bags while making her way around the capital.

Christine kept things low-key for the outing, donning a white T-shirt worn beneath a longline beige cardigan.

The mother-of-one added blue skinny jeans and white trainers to her relaxed look, while carrying her essentials in a black leather handbag.

Christine looked radiant as she enhanced her features with a neutral make-up palette, while her brunette tresses were left to fall on her shoulders.  

Christine's cheerful display comes after she and husband Frank celebrated daughter Patricia's second birthday on Tuesday.

The presenter and the football manager, 42, marked their little one's big day at home with a Peppa Pig-themed party.

Sharing snaps from the low-key celebration via Instagram, Christine gushed: 'Our little girl is the big 2 already! 

'We mightn’t have been able to have a big party but we made up for it with a #peppapig cake, presents and plenty of balloons.'

Christine and Frank made sure to surprise Patricia by decorating their home with an array of adorable animal balloons as well as ones adorned with Peppa Pig characters.

She was also greeted with five gifts that were covered with Peppa Pig wrapping paper, and she also got a delectable cake with the iconic cartoon on the front.

Finishing off the fun celebration, Christine also ordered a tray full of chocolate cupcakes that were shaped like hearts and topped with other sweet treats.

As well as sharing Patricia with Frank, Christine is also step-mum to his daughters Luna, 15, and Isla, 13, who he shares with ex Elen Rivas. 

Frank and Christine first crossed paths at the Pride Of Britain awards in 2009, and Christine has previously said she and Frank were not meant to be at the award show on the night they met.

Speaking on Lorraine in October, Christine said: 'It’s a strange one, because it is ten years ago that we met at them, it was one of those nights that neither of us were meant to go to.

'It was a last minute thing for him and I arrived at the awards late because of work. We were sat on tables next to each other.'

Christine added that Piers Morgan got some credit for introducing her to Frank as he 'did do an introduction', and joked: 'He was there at that moment so I can’t actually take that away from him.'

The TV personality went on to gush over Frank's skills as a father to Patricia, as she praised: 'He is very good, he has to be directed a little bit, I suppose, but he's great. He's so brilliant with her.'
