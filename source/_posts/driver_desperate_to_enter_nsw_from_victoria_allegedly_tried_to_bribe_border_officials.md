A 66-year-old man allegedly tried to slip border officials $1,000 in cash to let him pass through a border checkpoint from coronavirus-riddled Victoria.

The man was allegedly attempting to cross the Victorian border into New South Wales just before 2pm on Friday.   

He was stopped by police, who requested to see his border permit to enter the state due to the travel ban currently in place.  

A 66-year-old man has been charged after he allegedly tried to slip border officials $1000 in cash to let him pass through the checkpoint (pictured, checkpoint in Albury on July 8)

The man allegedly could not give the officers a border permit.

Instead, he allegedly offered the police an envelope with $1,000 in cash.

He was arrested and charged with attempting to bribe a member of the NSW Police force.

The accused will appear in front of Moama Local Court on November 4.

He has been granted strict conditional bail.
