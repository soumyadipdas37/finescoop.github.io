He is famously outspoken when it comes to discussing politics and current affairs. 

But Joe Hildebrand, 44, turned his attention to a far more personal matter on Wednesday episode of Studio 10.   

Following a discussion about infidelity in relationships, Joe revealed that his ex-girlfriend once had sex with his best friend.  

'My best mate Matt we actually met because he slept with my girlfriend,' the father-of-three explained. 

Shocked, host Sarah Harris interjected by asking: 'When you were dating?' 

'It's hard to remember, we were sort of off and on again so much...' Joe laughed awkwardly.

Sarah decided to use the opportunity to take Joe's phone and ring Matt live on air - something that made Joe visibly uncomfortable. 

When Matt answered, he gave a rather bizarre account of what actually happened between himself and Joe's ex. 

'She stalked me. She deliberately orchestrated it, so she bedded me,' Matt explained, added that the woman 'actually paraded him in front of Joe' before seducing him into the bedroom.

'We still talk all the time': Things became even more awkward when Joe revealed to his fellow panelists that he and Matt are still 'really good friends' with the woman

'I was just a pawn! When I realised what she'd done I was so appalled that I did my very best to become friends with Joe,' Matt added. 

Things became even more awkward when Joe revealed to his fellow panelists that he and Matt are still 'really good friends' with the woman. 

'It was a very complex relationship. We still talk all the time,' he confessed. 

Joe has been married to journalist Tara Ravens since 2013.     

They have three children together: 11-month-old Maybellene Jill, two-year-old daughter Bonnie and five-year-old son Henry.
