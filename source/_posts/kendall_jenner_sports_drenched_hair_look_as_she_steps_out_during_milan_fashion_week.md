She was seen making a low-key arrival in Italy for Milan Fashion Week on Friday.

But Kendall Jenner had all eyes on her on Saturday afternoon, when she was spotted stepping out on the city's streets sporting completely drenched hair.

The 24-year-old model's usually impeccably styled raven tresses looked sodden as she made her way into a waiting luxury vehicle.

The younger sister of Kim Kardashian remained stylish for the outing, donning a full-length figure-hugging brown dress, which featured a high neckline and long sleeves.

Standing tall in a pair of chunky heavy duty boots, the California native shielded her eyes with a pair of stylish sunglasses.

In keeping with safety guidelines amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, the star rounded out her ensemble with a brown face mask.

A day earlier, she was seen wearing a crop tip and tracksuit bottoms as she arrived in the city alongside her pal and fellow model Hailey Bieber, 23. 

Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in Hugo Boss' show on Friday.

Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian.

'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. 

In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  

'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked, prompting Kylie to reply: 'Absolutely.' 

Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. 

The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair colour.

Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image 

The photo appeared to have been taken at a restaurant, where Kim and Khloe sat at the table while their younger sisters posed beside them. 

Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.

Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  

Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling.
