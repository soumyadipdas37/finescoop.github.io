Sarah Michelle Gellar and Shannen Doherty found a hilarious way to stay amused under quarantine on Sunday.  

The duo kicked out their weekend by sharing a video of themselves expertly nailing TikTok's popular #WineChallenge, which involves sipping a glass of wine without hands. 

Gellar shared the video on her Instagram, which showed Doherty holding the base of a half-filled wine glass between her teeth while slowly leaning backward so her pal could successfully drink the wine from behind her.

'#winechallenge well... it’s #laborday weekend and we always spend it with @theshando (usually involving the #malibuchilicookoff ) but since this year the party just consists of us, we figured why not try the wine challenge,' the 43-year-old Emmy winner captioned the footage. 

She joked: 'We ARE the party. #quarantine month 6.'

The actresses were successful in completing the challenge, as Gellar gulped down the mouthful of wine from a yellow glass.

They video, which featured Ariana Grande's track Dangerous Woman in the background, ended with the cup slipping and them bursting out in laughter. 

Like the 90210 star, 49, who sported a white t-shirt and matching shorts, Gellar beat the sweltering summer heat in a frilly romper. 

Doherty looked particularly pleased, as her longtime friend embraced her, as they sat in the grass.

The pair's video comes after a number of other stars, including Cameron Diaz and the Fanning sisters, posted videos  of their hilarious attempts. 

In July, Diaz sampled her new wine brand, Avaline, by doing the challenge with her business partner Katherine Power. 

Inspired by the There's Something About Mary actress, Elle and Dakota Fanning showed off their own wine-drinking skills, earlier this month.
