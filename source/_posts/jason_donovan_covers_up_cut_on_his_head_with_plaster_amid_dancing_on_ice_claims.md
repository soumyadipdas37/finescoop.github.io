Jason Donovan covered up his painful-looking cut above his brow with a plaster as he stepped out with his wife Angela in Notting Hill on Thursday.

The actor, 52, was spotted earlier this week with a gash on his forehead amid rumours he is set to star in the 2021 series of Dancing On Ice. 

Despite the injury, Jason appeared in high spirits as he headed to a farm shop to pick up some organic goods with Angela

Jason cut a casual figure in a white T-shirt which he teamed with navy shorts and trainers. 

He slung a light blue jumper over his shoulder and put his glasses on as he walked through the capital. 

Angela, meanwhile, also dressed down for the shopping trip in a black T-shirt, joggers and trainers.

The pair were no doubt keen to enjoy some quality time together now, as Jason will need to dedicate plenty of time to training on the rink if he's signed up for Dancing On Ice.   

The former Neighbours heartthrob - who competed on Strictly in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the ITV show when it airs in January.

A source told The Sun: 'Jason is a great signing for the show as he has plenty of star power.

'He knows how to dance but if he thinks it’ll be any help once he’s on the ice he has another thing coming. 

'He’s hoping to rank higher in this show than he did on Strictly, he just needs to find out if he can stay upright once he has his skates on.'

MailOnline has contacted Jason's representatives for comment.

Jason isn't the only West End star who has been linked to the rink, with Denise Van Outen said to have signed a deal worth around £40,000 to appear on the series. 

According to the Daily Star, Denise 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month.

A source told the publication: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'

The mother-of-one is a natural performer after reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012 and playing Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway and in the West End.
