Kathie Lee Gifford was over the moon on Monday as she celebrated her son Cody Gifford's wedding.

The 30-year-old son of her and Frank Gifford tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend Erika Brown over the Labor Day weekend.

Kathie Lee, 67, shared a lovely photo to Instagram of the bride and groom on their special day to celebrate the occasion.

 God gave us a glorious day to celebrate this glorious couple. So grateful.¿¿¿¿

Her photo showed Cody and Erika strolling down a gravel path between neatly trimmed hedges.

The groom, who opted for a neck tie rather than a bow tie, stared lovingly into his bride's eyes.

Erika stunned in a lacy off-the-shoulder gown with long sleeves decorated with white flowers.

The brunette beauty also added a jeweled tiara to her wedding day look. 

'God gave us a glorious day to celebrate this glorious couple. So grateful,' Kathie Lee wrote in the caption while adding the prayer hands emoji.

Erika shared another sweet photo of the two lovebirds embracing before a kiss, with her hands caressing Cody's face.

'Happily ever after,' she captioned it, along with 'Matthew 19:6,' which reads, 'So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate,' in the New International Version of the Bible.

'Cody married!! Cassidy married! I am the happiest mama in the world!' the former Today Show host gushed in the comments.

She previously announced Cody and Erika's engagement in May 2019 with a sweet photo of the two kissing under the sun.

'My son is engaged and I couldn’t be happier for him and @msamerikabrown!!!' she wrote of the couple who had dated since 2013.

Popping the question: Back in May, she marked her 30-year-old son's engagement with a sweet photo of him and Erika kissing post-proposal

Brown didn't seem to be expecting the proposal at the time. 

'What started as a fairly normal weekend has turned into the BEST EVER. Couldn’t be happier!' she wrote in her Instagram Stories.

'The biggest thank you to everyone for your support,' she continued, adding the hashtags, '#thebestgiFFt' and '#loveisthegreatestgiFFt,' which referenced Cody's last name Gifford and Kathie Lee's wine label GIFFT.

It was the second big celebration of the year for Kathie Lee, whose daughter Cassidy got married in June to Ben Weirda.
