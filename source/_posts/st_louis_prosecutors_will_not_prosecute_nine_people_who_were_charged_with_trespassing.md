Nine people charged with misdemeanor trespassing after a racial injustice protest in a private St. Louis neighborhood in June will not be prosecuted, city officials said on Tuesday.

Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who live in the neighborhood, confronted the demonstrators with guns and have been charged with unlawful use of a weapon, a felony.

The nine protesters were issued citations earlier this month.

Several hundred demonstrators on June 28 veered onto the private street where the McCloskey's Renaissance palazzo-style mansion sits

Patricia McCloskey and her husband Mark McCloskey drew their firearms on protestors, including a man who held a video camera and microphone, as they entered their neighborhood during a protest against St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson

It wasn't clear why just nine of the estimated 300 protesters were issued summonses. 

Deputy City Counselor Michael Garvin said in a statement on Tuesday that the prosecution of the trespassing charges 'is not warranted'.

"After consideration of all factors, the city counselor determined that prosecution is not warranted against these particular individuals. Having reached that conclusion, all charges were refused,' Garvin said.

Municipal court prosecutors reviewed video, conducted interviews and examined property records of the incident. 

Gardner said residents who are trustees of the neighborhood, Portland Place, did not want to pursue trespassing charges.

Patricia McCloskey described how protesters 'broke an iron fence down' before 'trying to set fire to the mayor's house'

Protester Ohun Ashe suggested in a tweet earlier this months that the trespassing summonses were not warranted. The charges have since been dropped

The couple made headlines when Mark McCloskey was seen armed with an AR-15 rifle and his wife with a semiautomatic handgun during a confrontation with marchers passing by their home. 

Marchers were using the street to get to the house of Mayor Lyda Krewson. 

The McCloskeys, who were armed with an AR-15 rifle and semiautomatic handgun, have become national figures for conservative Republicans and gun rights advocates since the confrontation and gave an opening night speech during last month's Republican National Convention.

Their lawyer, Joel Schwartz, said Tuesday that the demonstrators were clearly trespassing and the McCloskeys 'were clearly within their rights to do what they did.'

President Donald Trump and Missouri Governor Mike Parson criticized the charges against the McCloskeys. 

Parson has said he will pardon the couple if they are convicted.
