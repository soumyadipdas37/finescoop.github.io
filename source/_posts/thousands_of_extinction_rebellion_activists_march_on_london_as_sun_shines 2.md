Thousands of Extinction Rebellion activists massed in London today to call on the government to take urgent steps to tackle change as they kicked off two weeks of controversial large-scale action.

Protesters today waved banners including 'Make Earth Great Again' as they marched in large numbers down the Mall - with limited social distancing despite current Covid restrictions. 

The rallies in Parliament Square and in Cardiff and Manchester come after protests planned for earlier in the year were cancelled due to the spread of the coronavirus. 

There were limited XR protests yesterday, including outside banks in Essex over the financial industry's investment in fossil fuels, but few activists turned out.  

Protesters today waved flags and banners as they marched in large numbers down the Mall - with limited social distancing despite current Covid restrictions, although many wore masks 

Protesters held banners including 'Make Earth Great Again' while another read 'the only thing we should be burning is safe' in an apparent reference to the government's Covid advisory group

Demonstrations also took place at St Peter's Square in Manchester, where banners bore slogans including 'planet over profit' 

MPs returned to Westminster today after a summer recess, and protesters are lobbying them to support a 'Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill' and a citizens' assembly to discuss new approaches to tackling climate change.

'The government is failing to do what's necessary to keep people safe. We are here, taking action, because their criminal negligence is putting lives at risk,' the group said on its website.

'We refuse to be bystanders and wait for this emergency to push beyond the point of no return.'

Last week organisers said that other 'institutions of power' would be targeted in the coming days, adding that they would encourage protesters to respect social distancing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many of the banners in London included references to Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who today defended his climate record 

Police have placed restrictions on where protestors could gather and said they must follow the rules or be liable to arrest.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that climate activists should be 'jumping for joy' at the government's climate record, and today said new policy announcements would be made in the autumn.

'From this crisis we will build back better in this country, we will build back faster and we will build back greener,' Johnson told senior ministers ahead of a cabinet meeting.

'And there will be a lot to more to come about the way in which this government is going to lead a new green industrial revolution for the UK.'
