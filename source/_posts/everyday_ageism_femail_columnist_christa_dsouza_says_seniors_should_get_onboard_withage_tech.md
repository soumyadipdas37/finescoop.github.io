It's the last tolerated prejudice. But Femail's had enough. It's time we called out those day-to-day moments when we're patronised for no longer being young... 

It's a fact. By 2050 the over-60 age group will account for more than 20 per cent of the world's population.

We are, it turns out, the fastest-growing demographic and the market catering to our needs is predicted to be worth a whopping one trillion dollars.

Christa D'Souza (pictured) explains why seniors should start their own 'age tech' companies

In other words, enough with the 'OK Boomer-ing'. If you millennials and Gen-X-ers want to make it big, it is us you must look to for inspiration.

Ask anyone in Silicon Valley and they will tell you 'Age tech' — that's technology built around the needs and wants of older folk, fall prevention systems, in-built sonar alerts etc — is a very sexy field to get into right now.

Although as I write this, I am thinking, 'Shouldn't we ourselves be getting in on the act too? Why let everyone else make money off us?'

Only we know how our needs can genuinely be met, after all. And if the idea of making money off ageing sounds nuts, look no further than Helen Ruth Elam — aka Baddiewinkle — the 92-year-old Instagram influencer followed by the likes of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, whose brand is already worth more than a million dollars. 

Seniors just wanna have fun.
