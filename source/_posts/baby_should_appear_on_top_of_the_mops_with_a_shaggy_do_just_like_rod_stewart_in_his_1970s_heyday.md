This baby should appear on top of the mops – after being born with a shaggy do just like Rod Stewart in his 1970s heyday.

Mother Corinna Anderson was stunned when Tayah was delivered with the head of thick wild hair.

The baby still has a little way to go to grow the full mullet beloved by Rod.

But her resemblance to the singer – whose hits include Da Ya Think I’m Sexy? – is uncanny when she wears leopard print.

Miss Anderson, 33, said: ‘There isn’t one place we’ve been where her hair hasn’t been mentioned by someone. Some people try and have a subtle look, but others will come over and say, “Oh my God. She’s got so much hair”.’

Miss Anderson and fiance Lewis Murphy, 29, a diamond driller, were told by the sonographer at the 32-week scan that she could notice a bit of hair. 

But the couple did not realise just how much she had until she was born weighing 8lb 6oz in Ashford, Kent, in January. 

Miss Anderson recalled: ‘Even the midwives said, “Oh my God”.

‘Lewis and I both had a little bit of brown hair when we were born, but nothing like Tayah.’

Tayah is now eight months and her locks have started to become lighter with blonde and red streaks.

Miss Anderson added: ‘When she wakes up it’s just wild, sticking up all over the place. It looks like she’s been dragged through a hedge backwards.

‘We have never cut her hair and don’t plan to anytime soon.’
