Bachelor alum Liz Sandoz and her husband Vito Presta have announced the arrival of their first child.

Sandoz posted a sweet snap to her Instagram on Wednesday and shared: 'September 1st at 9:41pm, Jovie Noelle made her entrance into this world. We are so incredibly in love.'

In the photo, the proud new parents are seen gazing down on their newborn daughter as she lies on a bed.

 September 1st at 9:41pm, Jovie Noelle made her entrance into this world. We are so incredibly in love and grateful for the support we had in labor and delivery and this week following. Although she made her entrance into the world a week ago, she just made it home to us. I planned a lot for birth but I never planned on leaving my daughter in the hospital NICU. She is such a strong fighter and has wowed the doctors with her ability to overcome since day 1. We are still processing this last week and going to take some time together as a family to soak everything in since this is the first time we get to be all together as a family. We could not have done it without our incredible @omgmidwives family, our midwife @sarahstetina and our doula @karishmadarji We cannot wait to share Jovieâ€™s birth story with you next week on the podcast! ðŸ“¸ @karishmadarji (my amazing doula)

In her post, Sandoz revealed that the baby's entrance into the world had had some complications but she is now doing well.

'Although she made her entrance into the world a week ago, she just made it home to us,' she explained.

'I planned a lot for birth but I never planned on leaving my daughter in the hospital NICU. She is such a strong fighter and has wowed the doctors with her ability to overcome since day 1,' she shared.

The couple had confirmed the pregnancy in April, waiting until 20 weeks along to break the news since Sandoz had previously suffered a chemical pregnancy in 2019.Â 

A chemical pregnancy is a term used to describe a very early miscarriage which occurs before the fifth week of gestation and well before the fetus can be visibly detected on an ultrasound, according to WedMD.Â 

The birth doula rose to fame when she competed on Nick Viall's season of ABC's The Bachelor in 2017.Â  She was eliminated in the second week.Â 

Sandoz went on to find love with concrete laborer, Presta. They married in February 2019 at the Glacier National Park in Montana.Â Â
