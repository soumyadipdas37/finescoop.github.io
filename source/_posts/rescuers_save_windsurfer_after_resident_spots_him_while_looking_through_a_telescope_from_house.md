A windsurfer has been rescued miles from land after a member of the public spotted him in difficulty while looking through a telescope from their house.
A rescue operation was launched after the eagle-eyed resident, who was at home in Anstruther in Fife, dialled 999 and asked for the Coastguard.
Both RNLI lifeboats from Anstruther were launched to search for the windsurfer, who was trying to cross the Firth of Forth on Friday evening.
He was found ten miles from Anstruther and six miles from his destination of Dunbar in East Lothian.
In an RNLI video of the rescue, he can be heard telling rescuers that ‘the wind dropped’

He was taken by lifeboat to Dunbar and the volunteer crew there launched their inshore lifeboat to help with the entry into a narrow and blustery harbour mouth.
RNLI volunteer crew member Shelley Watson said: ‘We would like to praise the efforts of the caller who not only spotted the windsurfer in difficulty but dialled 999 and asked for the Coastguard.
‘If you see anyone in difficulty, we ask that you too do as this person did and dial 999 and get help to the person.’
