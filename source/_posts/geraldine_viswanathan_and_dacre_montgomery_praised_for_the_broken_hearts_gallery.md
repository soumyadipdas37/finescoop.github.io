In the movie, Geraldine plays art gallery assistant Lucy, who has trouble letting go of her exes and keeps mementos for her various relationships.

She soon meets Nick [Dacre], and the two create the Broken Hearts Gallery in his massive apartment with all the reminders of her previous relationships.

However, in signature rom-com style, Lucy finds herself falling for Nick during their joint venture.

In the newly released early reviews, the Chicago Sun-Times noted that the movie 'retains a certain freshness' in the well-trodden path of girl-meets-boy storylines.

Insider also noted that Geraldine's comedic performance served as the 'movie's fuel' and 'goes against many of the rom-com tropes.'

Variety credited The Broken Hearts Gallery's 'precociously witty synthetic tingle' to Viswanathan's 'comic sizzle'.

Geraldine's leading man Dacre was also littered with attention from impressed critics, with Deadline comparing his 'appealing, charmful and easygoing' take on his character to Hollywood star, Zac.

Perth born actor Dacre has seen a stratospheric rise in Hollywood thanks to his role of menacing bully Billy Hargrove on the popular series, Stranger Things.
