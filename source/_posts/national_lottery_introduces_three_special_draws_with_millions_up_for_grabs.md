A series of special lottery draws are due to take place in September, with hundreds of millions of pounds up for grabs.

Changes are also being made to one of the nation's most popular draws, the Lotto, where players will now be in a chance of winning an extra fiver, according to Camelot.

The operator of the National Lottery said it hoped that the alterations will provide a much-needed boost to retailers in the continued challenging high street environment - although many of its players now buy tickets online or on its app.

Dubbed the 'Big September' special draws, Camelot will kick off the events with a £20million Lotto 'Must Be Won' draw on Saturday 5 September.

This will be followed by two EuroMillions draws – one guaranteeing 20 UK millionaires on Friday 18 September and one offering a boosted jackpot of over £100million on Friday 25 September.

Neil Brocklehurst, Camelot's commercial director, said: 'We've got three fantastic draws lined up in September to get National Lottery players excited, as well as to provide a commission and footfall boost for our 44,000 retail partners.'

He adds: 'Kicking off the month with a Lotto £20million Must Be Won draw, retailers could boost their sales by over 30 per cent.

'This will then be closely followed by two incredible EuroMillions draws – one which will make 20 guaranteed millionaires and one with a boosted jackpot of over £100million – which could lead to a massive 80 per cent retail sales increase, when compared to a normal EuroMillions draw.'

In addition, there will be a special 'Must Be Won' draw to launch the change to Lotto when it comes into effect in November, as well as a series of festive draws around Christmas and New Year.

The change to Lotto, which is played every Wednesday and Saturday, will see around a million people win a fiver in certain 'Must Be Won' draws.

Following the changes made in November 2018, the Lotto jackpot can only roll five times before it must be won.

Since then, there have been 24 Lotto 'Must Be Won' draws – 20 of which have resulted in a Lotto 'Rolldown' because nobody matched all six main numbers to win the jackpot outright, and so it was shared among the cash prize winners in all of the lower prize tiers – resulting in winners receiving boosted cash prizes.

As of Saturday 7 November, players who match two main numbers in a Lotto 'Must Be Won' draw where no one matches all six main numbers to win the jackpot outright will also scoop a share of the jackpot – winning £5 in addition to their free Lucky Dip. 

There are normally between 950,000 and 1.3million Match 2 winners in a 'Must Be Won' draw – so, from later this year, around a million people will scoop £5.

Meanwhile, the boosted cash prize amounts for the other tiers will continue to vary because they are dependent on the remaining jackpot amount – every other tier is allocated a set percentage of the remaining jackpot – as well as the number of winners in each tier. 

This is the first time a cash prize has been available for matching two main numbers on Lotto.

Brocklehurst added: 'In terms of Lotto, the changes we made a couple of years ago are continuing to prove really popular – particularly the 'Must Be Won' draws where, when the jackpot isn't won outright, it rolls down to all of the other cash prize winners.

'But we're always looking at ways to make our games even better, and one thing that Match 2 winners were regularly telling us was that they wanted a share of the jackpot too.

'We know an unexpected extra fiver – which could be spent on a box of chocolates, a book or magazine, or to treat a friend to a coffee – can really put a smile on someone's face. 

'For our retail partners, on top of the usual commission they make on the free Lucky Dip and paying out some of the other boosted prizes, this will mean a significant number of players reinvesting their £5 win back in store.'

Aside from giving out cash prizes to players, up to £600million of National Lottery funding is being used by charities and organisations to help those affected by coronavirus – including £300million to support the most vulnerable in communities across the UK.

In 2019 to 2020, the National Lottery awarded more than £4.5billion in prizes to players and created 355 new millionaires – including the UK's biggest-ever winner, an anonymous ticket-holder who scooped a £170million EuroMillions jackpot in October 2019.

The National Lottery has now awarded over £75billion in prize money and created more than 5,700 millionaires or multi-millionaires since 1994.
