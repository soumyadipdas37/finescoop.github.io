Former V8 supercar driver turned porn star Renee Gracie earned more than $1 million selling nude photos online. 

And the 25-year-old was only too happy to pose next to her new Mercedes-Benz roadster on Wednesday, worth more than $320,000. 

Putting her phone out for some raunchy selfies, the busty brunette struck a pose next to the eye-catching roadster while it was parked on the street.

Renee showed off her tattooed pins by standing next to the luxurious car while happily snapping away on her iPhone.

The brunette bombshell wore a pair of black denim shorts and a tight black crop top. 

She finished the outfit with a Louis Vuitton belt and a pair of nude-hued espadrilles. 

She wore her raven tresses down and opted for a glossy makeup style.  

Renee has earned more than $1million dollars selling nudes online - a lavish jump from her previous $18,000-a-year pay cheque.

After racking up over $500,000 in one month, the beauty spoiled herself with the newly-delivered Mercedes-Benz roadster.   

'I earned over $500,000 in June. I haven't had a month that big but I am fairly consistent with my earning from month to month,' she told The Daily Telegraph last month.  

'I will keep on working and posting videos. I don't see that type of money disappearing or stopping anytime soon and that is why I made the decision to buy the car.'

The Queenslander was once Australia's first female professional V8 Supercars driver, having famously partnered with Swiss racer Simona de Silvestro at Bathurst in 2015.

But after years of financial struggles, Renee abandoned her racing career and began posting nude pictures on adult website OnlyFans in late 2019.

OnlyFans is a subscription-based platform which allows 'creators' to earn money by sharing pornographic content for a monthly fee.

Speaking about her decision to quit Supercars, Renee told Daily Mail Australia in July she 'just couldn't afford it anymore'.

'I had to come up with $600,000 a year to race,' she said. 'I had to get my own sponsors and any crashes or scratches I got on the car I had to pay for myself.

'We had insurance but the excess was so high that the team bosses used to tell me, 'Don't crash – but if you do, make sure you write it off.' Just a minor crash could cost $10,000. It's a savage sport,' she finished.
