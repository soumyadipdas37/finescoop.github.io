'You always see happy me. This is me today and has been my daily occurrence since my breakup,' she wrote.

'It's bloody slow healing, sadness and hurt fill my whole body. Meditation, Yoga, exercise, nature, cooking, family, friends and focusing on my goals allows for my peaceful spirit to just be.

'I've never experienced anything like this where my soul still feels connected, I still love but know we don't align.' 

She went on to say that anyone going through a break-up is 'not alone'.

'I want to share this to inspire strength in you, as you do me, because I know you're also going through a break up or you're finding it extremely tough atm in these huge world changes and darkness we're being exposed too,' she continued.

'WE ARE GROWING STRONGER, AWAKENING to PURGE THE HATRED and are ASCENDING to be FREED FROM CONDITIONAL PATTERNS and CAN THEN BE DIRECTED BY OUR SOULS.' 

She signed off with the message: 'We're all equal beings and hopefully by now waking up to our true essence, our true nature which is only LOVE.
