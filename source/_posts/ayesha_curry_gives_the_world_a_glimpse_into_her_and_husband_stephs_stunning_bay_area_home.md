Ayesha Curry's a busy mom-of-three and entrepreneur, who kicked off her new chapter as a magazine mogul this past spring.

And when it came to furnishing the Bay Area, California home that she shares with her husband, Golden State Warrior MVP Steph Curry, the multi-hyphenate naturally took charge and decorated the property herself.

Thrilled to show off her hard work and impressive design chops, Ayesha, 31, gave the world their first peek at the house in the latest issue of Domino magazine.

Home, sweet home: Ayesha Curry gave the world a peek into her home in the latest issue of Domino magazine

Ayesha, who launched Sweet July magazine in April, was the image of boss babe chic while posing in her elegant, monochrome abode - which the family picked up for $31million in 2019 according to Variety.

She wore a ochre-hued ensemble with yellow sneakers that would have looked perfect while courtside at one of Steph's games, placing her hand on her hip for a touch of sass.

Ayesha's home aesthetic is refined, relying heavily on clean colors and smooth lines to create a zen, yet design-forward atmosphere.

Talking about her attraction to neutral colors, she said: 'I think people get afraid of being mundane, but there’s so much texture.

'You can create something beautiful that calms the spirit,' Ayesha went on.

Her sitting room is anchored around a curving, grey custom sofa designed by Vesta, which sits opposite two minimal, wire chairs that evoke a Bauhaus-style simplicity.

The art on the walls emphasize Ayesha's form-driven approach, adding to the crisp, desaturated charm of the whole home.

But that didn't keep Curry from making the space functional, something that was more than evident in the home's kitchen.

Form and function: The Curry's kitchen features a giant marble island which is both gorgeous and designed with plenty of use in mind

The great outdoors: She also offered a look at the yard, which perfectly blended into the forest foliage natural to Northern California

The kitchen features a giant marble center island, which sprawls from bar-top seating to a well-equipped food prep area on the other side. 

A video teasing the home's interior also offered a look at the yard, which perfectly blends into the forest foliage natural to Northern California.

Though Ayesha clearly has an eye for design, her skill-set goes far, far beyond that.

In addition to founding Sweet July, she is the author of two bestselling cookbooks and hosted her own show on Food Network.

Busy gall! In addition to her new magazine Sweet July, Curry has two cookbooks and a TV show under her belt. She's also designed a line of cookware and cotton bedding while similtanously diving into the world of food and wine with her own booze brand and four 

Things just grew from there, giving Ayesha the opportunity to design a line of cookware and cotton bedding, while also allowing her to make her foray into the wine and restaurant world.

Curry currently has her own wine brand in collaboration with sister-in-law Sydel Curry and owns four International Smoke locations. She has also been a CoverGirl ambassador since 2017.

'I think it was just embedded in me to build your own thing from the ground up,' she told Domino. 'I thrive off that adrenaline rush.'

Fans can get an even closer look at Curry's life inside the latest issue of Domino, which is out now.
