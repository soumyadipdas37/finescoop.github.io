Over the next three days men's tennis will get a glimpse of what life will be like after Djokovic, Nadal and Federer.

A new champion will be crowned at the US Open – for the first time since 2014 – and do not try to tell the semi-finalists that the eventual winner will have taken some kind of shortcut.

'There's no Roger, Rafa, Novak but there is Daniil (Medvedev), Sascha (Zverev) , and Pablo (Carreno-Busta),' said the fourth member of the quartet, Dominic Thiem.

 Novak Djokovic's disqualification means the semi-finals provide a glimpse of the future

'They're three amazing players. Every single one of us deserves this first major title, everybody will give it their all. Once we step on the court, the other three are forgotten anyway.'

The latter trio of names do not exactly roll off the tongue in the same way as the Big Three, or four when Andy Murray was in the group. But in future this weekend will probably come to be seen as the start of a broader transition.

On Thursday night the women's semis will be played, featuring Serena Williams against Victoria Azarenka, and Jennifer Brady against Naomi Osaka.

Thiem will meet last year's beaten finalist Medvedev and, irrespective of Djokovic's demise, it is no great surprise to see them facing off at this stage.

In terms of developing much-needed star names for the coming era it would have been pleasing to see either Stefanos Tsitsipas or the extravagant shotmaking skills of Canada's Denis Shapovalov come through on the other side of the draw.

As for Nick Kyrgios, potentially right up there with them, he cannot even bring himself to make the start line at present, and has chosen to stay in Australia while the tour tries to plough on with the US and French Opens via Rome and Kitzbuhel.

At a time when prize money and the ATP Tour revenues are bound to come under pressure due to a global economic slump it is going to need all the pulling power it can muster, as its marquee players begin to fade away.

Zverev, winner of London's ATP Finals in 2018, is no bad option, and you can hardly blame the very reliable Carreno-Busta for taking his chance when it has presented itself.

Yet the champion is likely to come from the second match, between the players with highest Grand Slam pedigree. Thiem has already made three Major finals, two in Paris and one in Melbourne – earlier this year – but he is seeking his first in New York.

'If I'm the first Austrian or not, it's not that important,' he said. ' For myself, it's really nice to reach the semis also at this Slam here, especially under tough mental circumstances with the times we are going through and everything.'

Thiem has not escaped controversy during the turbulent times of Covid, and was one of the participants in Djokovic's ill-fated Adria Tour during the summer.

He did not catch the disease there, but was criticised for not self-isolating afterwards. Instead he criss-crossed Europe playing exhibition matches while getting himself tested every other day. He simply loves to play.

The very reliable Pablo Carreno-Busta has also taken his chance when it has presented itself

At one point, when he got to play Patrick Mouratoglou's event in Nice he joked in protestation: 'I'm the most negative guy on tour.'

Last week he was again associated with Covid trouble, when he received a very modern day 'unsportsmanlike conduct' code violation because his support staff were found to have repeatedly failed to wear their compulsory masks around Flushing Meadows.

Having thrashed Australia's Alex de Minaur late on Wednesday he may well view his semi against Medvedev as his final. His past record versus the other two is so good – 7-2 with Zverev and 7-0 with Carreno-Busta – that it suggests this will be the biggest test.
