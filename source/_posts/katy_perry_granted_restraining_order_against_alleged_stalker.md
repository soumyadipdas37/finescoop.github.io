Katy Perry has been granted a restraining order against an alleged stalker.

The 35-year-old singer obtained the court order against a man named 'William' who 'trespassed' on the star's property, according to court documents obtained by The Blast on Tuesday. 

The protection order extends to her partner, actor Orlando Bloom, their newborn daughter Daisy, and Bloom's nine-year-old son Flynn.

In the filing, the Firework hitmaker described William as 'a complete stranger who trespassed on my property, is stalking me and who threatened my family.' 

He is 'believed homeless and living in silver Buick sedan,' she added.

Listing the last date of harassment as September 8 this year, Perry wrote that the alleged stalker 'jumped the fence of my home in the Beverly Hills area' while she was with Bloom and their daughter.

After being confronted by the couple's security, the man 'was placed under citizen’s arrest and then formally arrested for criminal trespass' by the LAPD.

Katy added, 'William has made threats on Twitter including that he wants to “snap Orlando Bloom’s neck” as well as lewd posts about me.'

The songstress concluded her application, 'I have great fear that he does or may have access to weapons. I am in immediate fear for my own safety, that of my partner, my newborn child, our family, and friends.' 

A subsequent hearing on the matter has been set for October 8.

'Hope it’s one she drags around for years till it becomes an unrecognizable shred that she keeps in her pocket as a teenager ♥️.'

She also tagged the location as 'Steam Folklore', encouraging fans to buy Taylor's latest record, recorded in lockdown.

Katy and Orlando, 43, introduced their bundle of joy to the world on Wednesday, August 26 via Unicef, for whom they serve as Goodwill Ambassadors.

The humanitarian agency released a statement on behalf of the parents: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter.

'But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.'

The statement was posted to Unicef's Instagram, as well as Orlando and Katy's, accompanied with a sweet black-and-white photo of Daisy's hand holding mom and dad's fingers.
