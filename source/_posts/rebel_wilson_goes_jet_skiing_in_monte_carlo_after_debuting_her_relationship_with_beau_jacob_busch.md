She recently debuted her relationship with multi-millionaire Jacob Busch.

And Rebel Wilson revved up her romance this week by going jet skiing during the couple's romantic getaway in Monaco. 

The 40-year-old actress posted video footage of her adventurous outing on Monday.

In one clip, Rebel couldn't wipe the excitement off her face as she filmed herself gliding across on the water. 

The Bridemaids star showed off her slimmed-down figure in a black lace maxi dress which she wore over her blue swimsuit. 

'Wooo.. Yeah baby,' she was heard yelling.

While her 29-year-old beau was nowhere to be seen, it's most likely he was filming the footage. 

Rebel's post comes after she shared a short clip of herself cuddling up to Jacob on their yacht.

The actress snuggled close to her handsome man, curling up with a blanket around her shoulders.

The beauty made her red carpet debut with Jacob at a gala in Monaco last week.   

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser. 

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of US$13.4billion.

Jacob and Rebel's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for the 29-year-old, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59.
