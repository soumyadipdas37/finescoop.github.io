Ciara shared a heart-melting selfie video to her Insta Stories of her newborn son Win snoozing peacefully against her front in a baby sling.

The 34-year-old singer is raising her three children with her dashing football star husband Russell Wilson.

In her new video she affectionately caressed the top of her baby's head and touched her puckered lips to her hand.

Ciara was glowing with happiness in the footage, which she posted to her social media Wednesday evening tagging her husband.

That evening Russell posted a sweet snap in which he cradled Win as the baby sat in his lap, wide awake in spite of the late hour.

'Look at the fellas, so cute! Late night chilling,' Ciara could be heard saying from behind the camera. 'He’s so precious - gosh, he’s so beautiful.'

As Russell kissed the top of his newborn's head the proud mother of three cooed: 'Yeah, Win! Hi, baby! Hanging out with Daddy!'

Russell jokingly impersonated the baby saying: 'Hey what’s up, Mama?' and Ciara played along saying: 'What’s up, baby?'

'Uh, you gonna feed me, that’s what’s up,' said Russell as Win, and Ciara cheerfully agreed: 'Yup! Oh yeah!'

When Russell said: 'We need to have more of these little guys,' in his own voice Ciara decided: 'Okay, now let's stop the video right now.'

She hopped on the treadmill last Tuesday for 'Day 1' of her fitness regimen after announcing her plan to lose 48lbs following the birth of her third baby.

Ciara posted a video of the workout to Insta Stories and made sure to tag her and Russell's dashing personal trainer Decker Davis.

One day earlier she had posted a selfie to her Instagram page and revealed to her fans how much weight she was planning to lose.

Ciara wrote: '48lbs to go! Starting the game plan tomorrow!! P.s. don’t know how easy it’s going be considering 3 baby’s now! Going to work really hard at this! Let’s go Mamma’s.' 

Having a laugh: Russell jokingly impersonated the baby saying: 'Hey what’s up, Mama?' and Ciara played along saying: 'What’s up, baby?'

Playful: When Russell said: 'We need to have more of these little guys,' in his own voice Ciara decided: 'Okay, now let's stop the video right now'

She and Russell share a three-year-old daughter called Sienna and also raise Future, Ciara's six-year-old son by the rapper of the same name.

Ciara gave birth to Win on July 23 this year and announced the good news with an Instagram video the following day.

Wearing a sparkly black mask and holding her baby to her chest, Ciara lay in her hospital bed and sang Happy Birthday To You. 

Motivated: She hopped on the treadmill last Tuesday for 'Day 1' of her fitness regimen after announcing her plan to lose 48lbs following the birth of her third baby

Mother of three: Ciara posted a video of the workout to Insta Stories and made sure to tag her and Russell's dashing personal trainer Decker Davis

'Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy & Daddy Love You!' she gushed in the caption. 'Win Harrison Wilson 7.23.2020 8lbs 1 oz.'

Russell posted the same caption over a heart-melting family picture in which he leaned into frame beside Ciara's hospital bed while she cradled their newborn.

The NFL star also uploaded a picture of himself beaming as he lay shirtless on a sofa in Ciara's hospital ward to do skin-to-skin with the baby. 

Tireless: Ciara is seen in a recent behind-the-scenes Instagram video, dancing up a storm for her Rooted music video just two days before she gave birth to Win

New release: The music video dropped August 12 and featured glimpses of Ciara wearing this outfit and dancing in this setting

Days before welcoming Win he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and told guest-host Joel McHale he was unsure if he would be able to attend the birth of his son.

The NFL training camps were opening near the end of July, and if Ciara had given birth after that point, coronavirus concerns may have kept Russell from the hospital.

'I think she needs me in the hospital! You know, she last time, she grabbed my hand, she almost broke my hand,' he remembered.

Mother of three: She also has a daughter called Sienna, three, by Russell and a son called Future, six,  by the rapper of the same name; she and her children are pictured in Rooted

And she was squeezing my right hand, I said: "Baby, baby, baby, other hand." So she grabbed my left, so you know, hopefully she'll know this this time,' he quipped. 

Ciara announced her latest pregnancy with a breathtaking Instagram snap taken on a beach during a trip to Turks And Caicos. 

The couple are devout Christians who abstained from having sex during their romance until they married in 2016 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England.
