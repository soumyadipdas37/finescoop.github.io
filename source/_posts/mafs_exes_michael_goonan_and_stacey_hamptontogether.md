Former Married At First Sight couple Michael Goonan and Stacey Hampton recently rekindled their friendship.

And the businessman and his 'ex-wife' looked to be getting on very well while spending time together on the Gold Coast on Saturday.

In a clip shared to Michael's Instagram Stories, the 28-year-old businessman, who split from co-star KC Osborne earlier this year, accompanied Stacey to the salon. 

Chance of a reconciliation? As seen on Michael Goonan's Instagram Stories on Saturday, the Married At First Sight star spent time with 'ex-wife' Stacey Hampton on the Gold Coast. Michael accompanied her to a hair salon 

'How boring it is waiting on a girl to get her hair done,' Michael jokingly said in an Instagram Stories clip, while Stacey, 26, got her locks freshly blow-dried. 

The pair later enjoyed a leisurely lunch in the Sunshine State with Michael's pals. 

'Don't embarrass me before all my friends,' he playfully directed at Stacey in another Instagram Stories clip. 

'I want you on your best behaviour, not like last night. Swinging off the trees like Tarzan. Nightmare,' he continued to joke.

Friendly: Michael also socialised with two blondes the previous night, as seen on his Instagram Stories 

Michael appeared to have enjoyed the previous night, socialising with two blondes.  

The sighting comes after a source told Daily Mail Australia that Michael is secretly hoping he will reconcile romantically with Stacey.  

'They're good friends now, but Michael wants her back,' the source said this month.   

Michael previously made a public appeal on Instagram for her to give him another chance - as mates.

Rumours: Michael and Stacey recently rekindled their friendship - but an insider told Daily Mail Australia this month that he hopes they will reconcile romantically 

Claims: 'They're good friends now, but Michael wants her back,' a source said 

Earlier this month, Michael shared a throwback photo of the former couple in happier times and wrote: 'So publicly Stacey. Wanna be my friend again?'

The millionaire's plea to Stacey came after his break-up with fellow Married At First Sight star KC Osborne in July.

KC blamed their break-up on Michael's unwillingness to change his 'playboy' ways.
