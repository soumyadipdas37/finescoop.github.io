 Arabella Del Busso will appear on Channel Seven's upcoming series SAS Australia, despite fans threatening to boycott the show if she appears. 

The controversial ex-WAG can be seen standing next to Schapelle Corby, 43, during a scene in the show's latest trailer. 

The influencer, 30, appears very briefly, wearing her hair in long, dark braids that are pulled off her face into a ponytail.

On her Instagram account, Arabella wore the same long braids in pictures shared seven and eight weeks ago, likely around the time the show had just finished production. 

A spokesman for the network confirmed filming has wrapped. 

 

The confirmation of her appearance comes after public outcry, with many calling to boycott the reality show due to her involvement.   

The model first made headlines when she went to the police with a video of her ex-partner Josh Reynolds yelling at her.

The charges against the 31-year-old Wests Tigers player were dropped in February, but fans aren't happy that Arabella has now landed a role on a major reality show.

Angry rugby league fans vented their frustration on Twitter after it was revealed  that Arabella would be joining the cast. 

'I'll never watch Channel Seven putting a loser like that on shows how much credibility they have,' one critic tweeted.

'I, for one, will not be tuning in... Absolutely disgusted in your efforts for ratings,' another added.  

Arabella last appeared on television in May, when she addressed her bitter split with Josh on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.   

During the interview, Arabella tearfully denied faking pregnancies and miscarriages during her tumultuous relationship with the footy star.

However, she did admit to passing off another woman's ultrasound scan as her own in order to 'spite' her then-boyfriend.  

Filming for SAS Australia begun earlier this year in Queenstown, New Zealand.

But production was later relocated to the NSW Snowy Mountains due to travel restrictions being enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
