Her EastEnders character Kat Slater is set for a return to Albert Square when the soap comes back on air next week.

And ahead of the big moment, Jessie Wallace stepped out to stock up on groceries as she made a low-key supermarket run to her local Tesco in Borehamwood on Wednesday.

The actress, 48, cut a casual figure in a black leather jacket and joggers, while also using her green and yellow scarf as a face covering.

Jessie paired her jacket with a black top, while she completed her off-duty look with a pair of white trainers. 

The soap star left her raven tresses loose for the occasion, while she shielded a lot of her make-up free face with a pair of oversized dark sunglasses. 

Jessie appeared in her own world as she loaded her goods into her car. 

And it appeared as though it was a productive shopping trip as her items included a new slow cooker and a broom.

Her outing comes days after EastEnders gave a first glimpse of her and co-star Lacey Turner's return to the soap. 

The duo are set to arrive back in the Square next week when the soap finally returns to screens, after filming was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

First look snaps of the pair show them posing in front of the iconic Queen Vic pub, as fans eagerly await EastEnders' return to screens after a three month break. 

Jessie was suspended from EastEnders for reportedly appearing drunk on set during filming.

Busy bee: Jessie headed to the supermarket during downtime from filming 

The actress, who has played fiery Kat on and off for nearly two decades, was temporarily written out of storylines after her behaviour was 'called into question.'

A source told the Sun Online that Jessie's recent outing to the pub is unlikely to land her in any trouble with her bosses. 

They said: 'Jessie was socialising in her free time, and has reported to work as normal so she will not need to be spoken to.' 

It had been claimed that Jessie was hauled into a crisis meeting with show bosses, who were said to have suspended her for two months, ordering her to 'sort herself out' before returning.

Meanwhile Lacey - who plays Stacey Fowler - has been on maternity leave after welcoming her daughter Dusty with husband Matt Kay last year.

Her exit came when Stacey dramatically fled the Square after attacking Phil Mitchell, and she split from husband Martin during her absence after believing he was having an affair with ex Sonia (Natalie Cassidy).

In typical soap fashion fireworks are expected when Stacey arrives back in Walford, as Martin (James Bye) has been pursuing a romance with her best friend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton).

EastEnders will finally return to screens on Monday September 7 after almost three months off air, when they ran out of filmed episodes after production was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
