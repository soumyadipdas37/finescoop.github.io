It may have been the first substitution sanctioned by Zoom but Marcus Browne could not have cared less as he clambered off the bench to head in his first goal for Middlesbrough.

With Neil Warnock sending instructions from home via video link after testing positive for coronavirus this week, Browne was sent on search of an equaliser midway through the second half.

Ashley Fletcher, the player he replaced, appeared to be struggling with a niggle but don't let that get in the way of a good story.

There were just nine minutes remaining when Browne’s fresh legs sent him beyond the Bournemouth defence to meet the most inviting of crosses from Paddy McNair to provide the remote Warnock and his team with a deserved point.

Bournemouth, in their second league fixture since Jason Tindall replaced Eddie Howe in the dugout, were denied at the death when Marcus Bettinelli produced the third of three outstanding saves to claw Jefferson Lerma’s header around the upright.

But that would have been harsh on a Boro team that responded to the encouragement of a socially-distanced but vociferous home support.

They had been quiet when Dominic Solanke extended something of a scoring spree, after a barren initial 18 months as a Bournemouth player.

The England Under-21 striker did not find the net in a league match until July, having signed from Liverpool for £17million in the winter transfer window of 2018-19, but struck in victories over Leicester and Everton during the delayed finish to last season and his confidence doesn’t appear to be lacking if his 38th-minute finish was anything to go by.

The visitors had been denied just moments earlier when the recalled David Brooks spun on the edge of the area to unleash a shot that was arrowing into the top corner before a feather touch from the flying Bettinelli re-directed it.

Although Bettinelli dealt with the first corner that followed, the concession of a second from Bournemouth’s left saw Solanke steal across the fringe of the six-yard box to flick Arnaut Danjuma’s delivery between his own legs and inside the near post.

It was debatable whether Bournemouth were deserving of their advantage but not so that their opponents had once again suffered for their lack of oomph in the final third.

Middlesbrough, the lowest scorers in last season’s Championship, had begun the day by announcing the signing of a new striker in Chuba Akpom, a £2.75million arrival from PAOK, the Greek club he helped to the league and cup double in 2018-19.

The former Arsenal trainee’s only goals in English football are the seven he managed across all competitions for a Hull side promoted from this level in 2015-16, although he scored against Ajax in last year’s Champions League, and it is hoped he returns here as the finished product at the age of 24.

So far this season has been an addendum of the last for Boro, with three games against second-tier opponents yet to yield a goal.

With Warnock restricted to dispatching instructions to his team via his assistant Kevin Blackwell on the touchline, they began brightly, with George Savile narrowly failing to make good Djed Spence’s surge infield by stroking wide inside 90 seconds.

But once again they struggled to manufacture efforts on goal from open play.

Grant Hall twice rose highest at corners either side of the interval, nodding too high, and then straight at Asmir Begovic.

The 1,000 or so who cajoled their team with chants of ‘Come On Boro’ from the West Stand would have anticipated the best chance of their pleas for a goal being answered by Britt Assombalonga.

Middlesbrough were able to put out 1,000 tickets on offer for their game on Saturday 

Indeed, his direct running during the second period caused mayhem in the Bournemouth backline. Chris Mepham took a caution to stop him while Begovic raced from goal to make a tackle on the edge of the area soon afterwards.

Middlesbrough did have the ball in the net when Assombalonga’s free-kick was spilled by Begovic, whose error was trumped when Browne miscontrolled the rebound to tee up the blatantly offside Savile.

Solanke could have sealed things moments later but his shot on the run was kept out by Bettinelli’s feet - and Browne nipped in to gain a share of the spoils at the other end.
