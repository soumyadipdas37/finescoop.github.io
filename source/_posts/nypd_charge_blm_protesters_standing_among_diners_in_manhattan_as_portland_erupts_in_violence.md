There were chaotic scenes in New York's West Village on Saturday night as a Black Lives Matter protest suddenly turned violent.

It saw police quickly surround demonstrators before the protest spilled out into the West Village where cops were forced to chase protesters across streets where people were dining out.  

Across the country in Seattle, there were similar anarchic scenes as protesters blocked off intersections by setting dumpsters ablaze as nationwide protests continued for a fourth night. 

Demonstrators gathered in several cities across the country aside from New York, including Los Angeles, Louisville and Denver to express their anger days after it was announced that the officers who shot black woman Breonna Taylor in her Kentucky apartment during a drug raid last March, would not be charged with her death. 

Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers in Louisville who entered her home during a narcotics investigation in March.

The Kentucky grand jury returned three charges of wanton endangerment Wednesday against fired Louisville Officer Brett Hankison over shooting into a home next to Taylor's with people inside.

NEW YORK CITY

A Black Lives Matters protest at Washington Square Park quickly escalated in to a violent situation on Saturday night as police surrounded demonstrators.

Hundreds of members of the NYPD surrounded the BLM protesters. Then police in riot gear and on bikes rushed into the crowd.

'Just dancing, that's all we were doing. They came out of nowhere,' one protester told CBS2.

'We were free, dancing in the streets, alleviating our pain. We are in pain every single day, and they can't even let us have that,' another protester said.

A dramatic scene unfolded late Saturday between a group of protesters and police steps away from an outdoor dining establishment in the West Village

After several tense moments, police dispersed.

'They're terrorizing joy. We didn't come here to do anything but to have fun,' protester Shanee Grant said.

'The police just came and stormed in and took our belongings … They swarmed us. We were peacefully assembled. There was nothing, no violence,' one organizer said.

Police could be seen taking a number of people into custody. 

Soon afterwards, video emerged of NYPD officers rushing at protesters on a sidewalk in the West Village. 

A recorded message was played just seconds before police rushed across the empty street to arrest protesters.

'Please be advised that pedestrians are not permitted to walk in the street or roadway,' the message played at the intersection of Hudson Street and West 10th Street.

The arrests were for disorderly conduct according to the NYPD who did not give specific details about what actions were taken by those arrested.

A police spokesperson confirmed 'multiple' arrests while a protester at the scene said that number was likely in the 'dozens' according to NBC4.

LOUSIVILLE, KENTUCKY

A diverse crowd of hundreds marched in Louisville's streets chanting 'Black Lives Matter' on Saturday night.

People in the crowd also chanted 'No justice, no peace' as cars honked along a busy downtown artery in this Kentucky city that has seen more than 120 days of demonstrations over the death of the 26-year-old Black woman in a police raid gone wrong.

A few police cars followed behind, with officers telling protesters to stay on the sidewalk and out of the street before the march ended. Many briefly ended up back at a downtown square that has been a focal point of protests.

But as a 9pm curfew time approached, a police loudspeaker announced that anyone who remained in the park would be arrested for a curfew violation. The square emptied out as people departed, many dispersing though one group headed to a nearby church where protesters had found refuge on previous nights.

As a crowd gathered outside the First Unitarian Church late Saturday, fires were set in a street nearby after 11pm.

 Police said fireworks burned a car, and windows had been broken at Spalding University buildings close by. Police tweeted that arrests would be made, but specific numbers weren't immediately released.

Some demonstrators were seen with makeshift shields made of plywood. Others took shelter inside the church, which closed its doors around midnight.

A previous protest on Friday night was peaceful though police arrested 22 people for curfew violations. A police spokesman said some also were charged with failure to disperse.

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer had urged continued peaceful protests in an appearance at a news conference Saturday evening.

'I´m mindful that many in our community are hurting and angry about the decisions announced this week,' Fischer said. The mayor said he supports protesters' First Amendment rights to protest though 'we just ask you to do that peacefully please.'

Taylor was shot multiple times March 13 after her boyfriend fired at officers who had entered her home during a narcotics raid by white officers, authorities said. Taylor's boyfriend said he didn't know who was coming in and fired in self-defense, wounding one officer.

On Wednesday, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced a grand jury indicted one officer on wanton endangerment charges, saying he fired gunshots into a neighboring home during the raid that didn't strike anyone. That officer has been fired.

At least 100 people were protesting on Saturday night and  planned to march to Louisville's East End

Cameron said the other officers were not charged with Taylor's killing because they acted to protect themselves.

Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, visited a downtown park on Friday with family and her lawyers, and called on Kentucky officials to release all body camera footage, police files and the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings. Palmer said in a statement read by a family member that she felt the criminal justice system had failed her. Palmer marched at the head of Friday's protest march.

The grand jury's ruling weighed heavily on protesters like Amber Brown. A central figure in the downtown demonstrations, Brown said she was angry.

'It feels like we went backward,' she said Friday night. 'I think people are still in shock and we´re not sure how to move forward.'

Brown criticized the police crackdown in the downtown area that has been in effect since early in the week.

'People are afraid to exercise their First Amendment right,' she said. 'Since when does protest have a curfew? Since when does freedom and civil rights have a curfew?'

At the other end of the political spectrum, around one thousand supporters of the right-wing Proud Boys group, some armed, rallied in Portland, on Saturday in a largely peaceful event that drew far fewer followers than organizers forecast and state authorities had feared.

The rally in a north Portland park ended after a few hours of speeches and chants, many against anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter groups which held a nearby counter-protest.

'You're here for the right reasons, the people down the street are against America,' said an unnamed speaker in a video posted on the Parler page of the self-declared 'Western chauvinist' Proud Boys.

The Proud Boys forecast a crowd of at least 10,000 when they asked for a permit to hold the demonstration, a request that was denied by the city.

State Governor Kate Brown declared a weekend state of emergency for Oregon's biggest city, saying 'white supremacist groups' were traveling from out of state to attend the rally called by the Proud Boys to 'end domestic terrorism' in Portland.

The Democratic-run city has seen four months of near-daily demonstrations against police violence and racism, many ending in violence.

Proud Boys leaders said the group's presence pushed Brown to declare an emergency and create a state and local police task force to keep the peace in a city President Donald Trump has called an 'anarchist jurisdiction.'

'It's crazy that it takes us to come here to solve things,' Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio said in video on the group's Parler page.

Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden has said Trump's rhetoric is stoking political violence.

As the Proud Boys rally broke up, Portland Police stopped one vehicle and confiscated firearms, paintball guns, baseball bats and shields.

The city remained on edge into the night given fears of clashes.

Local and state leaders said in a letter to the community that Proud Boys supporters had openly discussed military-style tactical operations and planned to cause chaos and violence while claiming to be acting in support of police.

Police said they were investigating an assault of one person documenting the Proud Boys rally and a total of three people were arrested there and at the counter-protest that also drew around 1,000 people.

The men-only Proud Boys group describes itself as a fraternal organization that 'venerates the housewife' and is 'anti-political correctness.'

Civil rights group The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the Proud Boys as a hate group, citing its members' anti-Muslim and misogynist rhetoric.
