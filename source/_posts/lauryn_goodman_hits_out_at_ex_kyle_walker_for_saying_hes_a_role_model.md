Lauryn Goodman took another swipe at her ex Kyle Walker on Instagram on Thursday, after the footballer said he is a 'role model'. 

The social media star, 29, hit out at the England ace, 30, for the comment after stating he acts like their child Junior, four months, 'doesn't exist'.  

Lauryn and Kyle struck up a brief romance after he split from his partner of 10 years, Annie Kilner but they have since reconciled and are now engaged.

Lauryn was responding to the Kyle's interview where he revealed his regret at breaking lockdown laws earlier this year, where he was branded a 'covidiot'.

The Manchester City star landed himself in hot water in April after hosting a party at his house during the height of the Government's lockdown measures.

In May, Walker broke regulations for a second time after driving to visit his parents and sister.

Hitting out: In the interview, Kyle revealed his regret at breaking lockdown laws earlier this year saying he was a role model and Lauryn took to Instagram to make a thinly-veiled dig

Support: The brunette beauty also shared a message from a fan who said she 'laughed out loud' when Kyle called himself a 'role model'

Kyle said: 'Obviously me and the boss [Gareth Southgate] spoke after the lockdown incidents and, you know, he assured me that we all make mistakes.

'Obviously, mine was on a bigger scale and gets magnified with me being in the public eye and a role model to young children growing up, so I have to take full responsibility for my actions, which I have done.'

Taking to Instagram, Lauryn wrote: '"I'm a role model". Yea okay hun. Whatever makes you sleep at night' (sic).

Surprise: Lauryn found out she was pregnant with Junior after she and Kyle struck up a brief romance following his split from his partner of 10 years, Annie Kilner 

The star's younger sister Chloe, 29, threw her support behind Lauryn as she uploaded the post: 'There's nothing worse than a man who can be everything to everybody else... except a father to their own child'.

Earlier this week, Lauryn insinuated that Annie - Kyle's on/off partner, with whom he shares sons Roman, Riaan and Reign with - 'controls' the sportsman. 

Sharing a series of direct messages to her Instagram Stories, Lauryn reassured fans that Kyle having 'nothing to do with' their son, was not her doing.  

'Is Kyle having absolutely nothing to do with Junior?' asked an Instagram follower.

Controlling? Earlier this week, Lauryn insinuated that Annie - Kyle's on/off partner, with whom he shares sons Roman, Riaan and Reign with - 'controls' the sportsman

Lauryn shared the DM and added: 'Still stalks me though. Hey! Don't worry your mini me is doing great.

She added: 'Answering because of the amount of messages I get and I don't want people thinking it's down to me. I would never deny Junior.' 

'I think you'll find if he's told "he can't" and is "controlled" - no wonder he acts how he does.... but me and JNR are happy.' 

After much fanfare when her pregnancy came to light, including anger from Annie, Lauryn admitted she 'has a lot to explain' to Junior.  

In a recent Instagram Q&A, she wrote: 'I think it's important for Junior to have privacy given the circumstances. He's super important to me and I don't want to affect his mental health in the future...

'He's already got to deal with a lot which I'll have to explain to him when he can understand so I need to protect him as best I can. He's my main priority'.
