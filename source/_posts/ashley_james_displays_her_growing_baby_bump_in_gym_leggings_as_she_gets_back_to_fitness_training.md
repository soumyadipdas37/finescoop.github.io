She shared a video of herself rolling around on the ball in plaid bottoms and a supportive maternity band as she said on Instagram: '26 weeks. I'm pretty sure this means it's my last week of the second trimester and only about 14 weeks left until we meet the baby!

'This week has mainly been about reminding myself I'm not invincible (as much as I like to think I am), and reminding myself of all the positive things about being pregnant during these weird times. 

'My body is definitely starting to feel stretched, especially after a big meal. I'm using body oil to keep my skin nice and stretchy (it also really relieves itchy nipples!).

Social distancing: Ashley reflected on the difficulties she has faced with the current coronavirus restrictions including not being able to see her family

'I took a break from training and reduced my length of walks, and that seems to have helped reduce the pain around my pelvis, so I'm ready to get back to training this week. 

'Oh, I also got a birthing ball. Not being able to go see my family was a bit gutting, however we did a family zoom call and there's some other perks about the current lockdown (trying to look on the brightside): the 10pm curfew means I get to see my friends and still get to bed early,' accompanied by a winking emoji. 

Ashley also revealed that she and her partner, Tom Andrews, have decided their child's name but have not announced it to the public yet.
