Two senior police officers have been charged with drug offences after a series of raids on homes across Brisbane and the Gold Coast.

Police stormed the properties on August 1 after a six-month investigation by Queensland Police's internal Ethical Standards Command unit.

Nine people were arrested during the operation, including the two male senior constables and a former police officer.  

'In keeping with our commitment to high standards of behaviour, transparency and accountability, we have undertaken to inform the public when an officer faces serious allegations of misconduct,' Queensland Police said in a statement.

Police raided properties across the Gold Coast and Brisbane on August 1 and detained nine people, including the two male senior constables and a former cop (stock image) 

'This does not mean the allegations against the officers have been substantiated.'

The 28-year-old, from the state's southeast, has been charged with supplying dangerous drugs and possessing dangerous drugs, among other offences.

The 29-year-old from the central region was charged with possessing dangerous drugs.

Both officers are scheduled to appear in Southport Magistrates Court on October 26.
