Tara Moss has revealed she's been in hospital for extreme pain stemming from a hip injury in 2016, which left her with mobility issues.

The 46-year-old crime author shared a post to Instagram, saying 'it's been a difficult and isolating experience' because she has been unable to see her family due to the COVID-19 restrictions.

'One week in hospital for management of severe pain and CRPS and I am just about ready for home, like waking from hibernation, or emerging from a cocoon of fog,' she wrote.

'It has been a positive if at times difficult and isolating experience. My body has had some moments of much-needed relief,' she added.

Tara went on to say she's 'grateful for the medical treatment and 'excellent care from the doctors, nurses and specialists.'

She added that it's been difficult because she's been unable to see her daughter due to COVID-19 restrictions.

'After so long without being able to see my daughter, due to the strict and important COVID safety protocols restricting visits, I cannot wait for that first hug,' she said.

She continued: 'Wishing excellent care to every one of the estimated 20% of people out there with chronic pain. Solidarity. We are many and though we are all different, we are all warriors in our own ways.' 

Tara has been using a walking stick since her right hip was injured in early 2016, causing 'chronic nerve pain and mobility issues'.

Appearing on Channel Seven's The Morning Show last year, she spoke of her efforts to destigmatise the use of walking aids.

Tara said: 'Visibility matters, so it's important to start being more open about it. I was hoping that I wouldn't need it, but now I embrace it.'

'The walking stick helps me to be more active, enjoy my life more fully and with less pain, and that's true for a lot of other people,' she added.
