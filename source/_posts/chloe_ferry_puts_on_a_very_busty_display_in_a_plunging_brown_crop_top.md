Chloe Ferry ensured she caught the eye on Thursday as she made her latest appearance in Marbella.

With temperatures soaring, the reality star - who has lost more than two stone in weight - later stripped down to a pair of bikini bottoms as she topped up her tan.  

The reality star's girly getaway comes after she ignored speculation she had faked a trip to Ibiza and had instead secretly joined her ex boyfriend Sam Gowland, 25, in Dubai.

It had recently been reported that the star had back together with her co-star ex - despite being in the throes of filming Celebs Go Dating.

A source told The Sun the former-couple were said to be 'reconnecting'; but fans also connected the dots.

An insider said: 'Chloe's taking it really slowly and she's keen to keep it quiet as her friends will all be furious after all the drama. It's a chance for them to reconnect.'

MailOnline contacted Chloe and Sam's representatives for comment at the time.

The present season of Celebs Go Dating signed Chloe up amid what appeared to be the complete end to her and Sam's romance.

The couple - who have been on/off for years and had a turbulent relationship since first getting together in 2017 - were believed to split for good in February.

This is thought to be what prompted her to sign up for the virtual version of the celebrity dating show.
