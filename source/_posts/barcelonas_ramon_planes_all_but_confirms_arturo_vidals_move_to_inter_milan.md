Barcelona sporting director Ramon Planes has all but confirmed Arturo Vidal's departure from the club.

The midfielder was left out of Ronald Koeman's squad for the Catalan giants' pre-season friendly against Gimnastic last weekend and has been heavily linked with a move to Inter Milan.

On Tuesday Planes provided an update on Vidal's future and indicated that the deal to take him from Spain to Italy was edging closer.

Barcelona sporting director Ramon Planes has all but confirmed Vidal's departure from club 

'Vidal? It's true that progress is being made in the departure of Arturo Vidal,' Planes said at Miralem Pjanic's unveiling. 

'I take this opportunity to thank him for these two years.

'Vidal is in negotiations for an exit, but it's not finalised yet.'

Vidal has made 96 appearances for Barcelona, scoring 11 goals and providing 10 assists, after joining from German giants Bayern Munich in 2018.

The 33-year-old has been vocal in his criticism of Barcelona, criticising the club for being too reliant on Lionel Messi and having too many youth products in the first-team. He slammed the club fro having just '13 professional players'.
