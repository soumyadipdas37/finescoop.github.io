Love Island star Rebecca Gormley was pictured enjoying the sunshine on Bournemouth beach on Tuesday. 

The 21-year-old showed off her toned abs, wearing a neon pink crop top and matching hotpants as she walked her dog. 

The top had a drawstring detail at the front which accentuated her assets and the shorts had ties at the sides.

Rebecca recently landed herself in hot water after she and boyfriend Biggs Chris, 27, ignored quarantine rules. 

They jetted straight from a holiday in Spain to Scotland earlier this month and brazenly posted about it on Instagram.

Rebecca shared racy Instagram snaps as she enjoyed her visit to her beau's home city of Glasgow, where the couple mixed with friends and family, enjoying dinner dates and spa treatments.

The couple had been holidaying in Ibiza, and should have quarantined for 14 days when they returned to the UK after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Rebecca and Biggs had arrived in Scotland the day before, with Biggs sharing a photo of his girlfriend checking in for their flight from Spain, alongside the Scottish flag and 'next destination.'

Once they landed, the pair visited Biggs' friends and family, sharing photos of a takeaway night.
