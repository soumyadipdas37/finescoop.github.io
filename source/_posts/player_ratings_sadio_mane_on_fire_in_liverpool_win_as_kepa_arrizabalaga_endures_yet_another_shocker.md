Liverpool scored a comfortable 2-0 victory over 10-man Chelsea on Sunday to preserve their 100 per cent record in the Premier League after two games. 

Things fell apart for the Blues after the break after Andreas Christensen's sending off for a clumsy challenge on Sadio Mane, with the Senegalese star firing in a double after the restart.   

Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his verdict on each player's performance at Stamford Bridge. 

Liverpool ran-out 2-0 winners against Chelsea on Sunday, led by the magnificent Sadio Mane

CHELSEA 

Kepa Arrizabalaga: Dreadful mistake led to Liverpool's second goal and played like a man who knows his time at the club is up - 4

Reece James: Tough afternoon trying to contain the raids of Mane and Robertson but never let his head drop - 6

Andreas Christensen: His attempt to halt Mane would not have looked out of place at Twickenham; had to be sent off - 4

Andreas Christensen gave Chelsea an uphill battle after his clumsy tackled earned a red card

Kurt Zouma: Arguably the best of Chelsea's defence and threw himself into the challenge of trying to shackle Firmino - 6

Marcos Alonso: Turned inside out by Salah and Firmino for Liverpool's first goal and once again showed why Ben Chilwell has been recruited - 5  

N'Golo Kante: Solid first 45 minutes but ended up chasing shadows in the second as Liverpool dominated possession - 5.5

Jorginho: Only a matter of time before his hop, skip and jump failed from 12 yards and this was it - 5 

N'Golo Kante couldn't save Chelsea after they went down to 10-men against the champions

Mateo Kovacic: Like the rest of his colleagues, never got close to laying a glove on Liverpool's midfield and was eventually replaced - 5 

Mason Mount: Great attitude, had a fine effort that dropped onto the roof of the net and never stopped working - 6.5

Kai Havertz: Can consider himself unlucky to have been the fall guy for the tactical reshuffle following Christiansen's red card - 6 

Timo Werner: Best player in Blue and always at the heart of their most dangerous moments. He'll score a lot of goals - 7 

Kai Havertz was replaced at the break after struggling to make an impact for Lampard's men

MANAGER 

Frank Lampard: At the moment he is trying to work out what his best system is; clearly some players did not fit this equation - 6 

LIVERPOOL 

Alisson Becker: Has been waiting to make a big penalty save and his stop to deny Jorginho secured the win - 7 

Trent Alexander-Arnold: Bright and busy down the right with some fine passes but his set plays lacked their usual accuracy - 6.5 

Fabinho: Not often do you a Liverpool central defender outshine Virgil van Dijk but the Brazilian did so with an imperious display - 9 

Virgil van Dijk: Sauntered through the contest, seemed to be playing in second gear and was never in trouble - 8 

Virgil van Dijk bounced-back from a tough opening match with a clean-sheet on Sunday 

Jordan Henderson's classy pass led to Christensen's red-card before he went off injured 

Andrew Robertson: Buzzed forwards and backwards and looks to have raised his standards following signing of Kostas Tsimikas - 7.5 

Naby Keita: Still waiting for him to grab hold of a match of this significance and he will be under pressure following Thiago's arrival - 6

Jordan Henderson: Beautiful pass set Mane away for game-changing moment but never emerged in the second half due a thigh injury - 7 

Gini Wijnaldum: Liverpool's Mr Reliable, the only blot on his performance was missing an unexpected chance from three yards in injury time - 7.5 

Sadio Mane was on fire with two goals, showing his quality once more for Jurgen Klopp's men

Mohamed Salah: He wants the Golden Boot again and you could see he was irritated that he never increased his tally - 8 

Roberto Firmino: People question his goal output but he is absolutely crucial to making this Liverpool team function and proved it again - 7.5 

Sadio Mane: One super header, one lesson in closing down and that led to two goals to cap a marvellous display - 8.5 

MANAGER 

Jurgen Klopp: Conjured a tune from his team that produced a performance that sets the standards going forward - 7 

REFEREE 

Paul Tierney: Made the right call with Chelsea's penalty but it was a surprise he didn't reach for a straight red-card for Christiansen - 6
