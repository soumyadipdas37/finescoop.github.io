Kai Havertz has left the Germany team's training camp to wrap up his £90million move to Chelsea, according to reports.

The German playmaker has been linked with Frank Lampard's men for months and the deal is expected to be confirmed imminently. Havertz was an unused substitute in his country's 1-1 draw with Spain on Thursday night as Chelsea's Timo Werner grabbed the headlines by scoring the opener.

And Havertz looks set to line up alongside the forward next season with the Athletic reporting that he has now departed from Joachim Low's squad in order to push the move through.

Frank Lampard is on the verge of securing another huge deal as he looks to battle for the title 

The deal could be clinched in the next 24 hours, the report adds, although the 21-year-old is yet to complete a medical.

It claims that both Chelsea and Bayer Leverkusen expected him to be left on the bench for the Germans against Spain to avoid the risk of injury as the two parties ensure the massive transfer goes ahead.

Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia has been handling negotiations with the Bundesliga outfit and Sportsmail understands the fee will reach £90m with add-ons included.

Blues fans were hoping to see Havertz and Werner play together for their country to get a glimpse of what their partnership could look like in the upcoming season, but their new £53m forward played up front with former Man City star Leroy Sane.

The former Leipzig man looked dangerous all night and fired his side ahead in the 51st minute, with Jose Gaya cancelling out his goal in stoppage time.

If Havertz's move to Stamford Bridge is confirmed, the club will take their summer spending past the £200m mark after a busy window that has seen them make five signings already.

In addition to Werner, they have also landed Hakim Ziyech from Ajax for £37m, while left back Ben Chilwell has also joined from Leicester and Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr both arrived on a free transfers.
