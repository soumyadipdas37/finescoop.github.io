Jacqueline is known for promoting body confidence and embracing her curves in her social media content.

During her family Greek holiday last month, the TV personality took to Instagram to share an 'unedited' snap, which saw her clad in a cute pink-coloured two-piece while on a boat.   

Beaming in the sea-filled snap, Jacqueline captioned the post 'Unedited but hell she is breathing in!!', explaining that it was completely untouched after previously showing her followers the power of editing apps.

It came days after she claimed that celebrities who edit their social media snaps must be 'insecure'.

In a series of videos to Instagram Stories, the ITV darling insisted she didn't have any qualms with making small tweaks to snaps, but thought it was a 'bit crazy' for users to completely change their body shape.

Jacqueline also shared her own attempt at altering a selfie she'd taken after jetting abroad on her family holiday with husband Dan and their kids.

In a series of videos, Jacqueline explained this was her first attempt at using an editing app, and reminded her fans that not all social media snaps are as they seem. 

The star demonstrated how she managed to change her own face to give the illusion of 'a full face of make-up.'

Jacqueline explained: 'I wanted you guys to know and see how easy it is and how much you can't really tell and that everybody does it.

'So you know when you looking at people thinking, ''they look flawless and absolutely amazing'', the majority they don't'.  

Self love: The star previously revealed she finally 'doesn't care' about being a size 12 to 14, after sharing a candid snap of her figure in a bikini from different camera angles

Jacqueline has previously spoken out in support of body confidence after revealing she is planning to kick-start an exercise routine.  

The star, who has embraced her size 12-14 figure, said on Instagram last month: 'I'm having those thoughts of I need to start doing a bit for me and I'm going to try and go for walks and maybe do some exercise. 

It comes after Jacqueline revealed she finally 'doesn't care' about being a size 12 to 14, after sharing a candid snap of her figure in a bikini from different camera angles. 

The I'm A Celebrity winner said she has finally accepted her curves and embraced being a 'plus-sized' woman, but hasn't ruled out the idea of hitting the gym to lose weight.
