The Claws talent, 32, sizzled while lying down in a strappy suit from the celebrity fashion line.

In addition to showing off her impeccable bikini body Saturday saw the beauty give an impassioned plea to her 9.7 million Instagram followers to shop more at black-owned businesses.

'When you shop Black-owned businesses, you are giving a lifeline to many who may be on the brink of closure or bankruptcy,' she captioned a short video in which she described it as 'legit one of the best ways to combat racism.'Â

Although much of Hollywood is currently shut down due to the novel coronavirus, Deadline reported Thursday that the actress would be joining the cast of the BET drama Games People Play when it began filming for its second season.

She'll play the daughter of the owners of a fictional LA basketball team who becomes a romantic complication for series leadÂ Sarunas J. Jackson.

Most recently, Karrueche has been appearing as a series regular on the acclaimed dark comedy Claws on TNT.

The LA native was previously attached to singer Chris Brown, but she currently has a five-year restraining order against her abusive ex, which won't expire until 2023.

She has since moved on to former New York Giants player Victor Cruz, whom she's been dating for the last two years.

In January, Victor appeared on the Wendy Williams show and opened up about his love for the stunning screen star.

'Do you want to get married? Do you love her enough for that?' asked a curious Williams, and Cruz replied in the affirmative, 'Absolutely. Absolutely.'
