Jofra Archer arrives wearing a hazmat suit in Abu Dhabi for the start of the Indian Premier League’s 13th and most unusual of seasons.

The bowler is one of nine England players included in the overseas contingent.

Ben Stokes will potentially make it 10 at some point but will not feature at the start of a tournament as he remains in New Zealand indefinitely to be with his ill father Ged and family.

Without Stokes, Player of the IPL in 2017, Steve Smith’s Rajasthan Royals will look to Archer, Jos Buttler and Tom Curran to carry their form from this month’s limited-overs matches against Australia into a 53-day event hosted entirely in the United Arab Emirates, where initial fixtures at least will be contested behind closed doors.

All foreign arrivals into Abu Dhabi must isolate for 14 days but the authorities have reduced that timescale for the IPL participants.

The 10 England players participating in the IPL from September 19 until November 10 are: Moeen Ali (Royal Challengers Bangalore), Archer, Buttler, Tom Curran and Stokes (Rajasthan Royals), Jonny Bairstow (Sunrisers Hyderabad), Tom Banton and Eoin Morgan (Kolkata Knight Riders), Sam Curran (Chennai Super Kings) and Chris Jordan (Kings XI Punjab).
