The Real Housewives Of New York City was first rumored to be diversifying its all-white cast after the news of Dorinda Medley's shocking exit in August. 

Less than a month after the network's decision to give the 55-year-old fan favorite  the ax, the reality TV show appears to be fulfilling its quest for a more inclusive cast. 

The newest member of the series is reportedly motivational speaker Bershan Shaw, according to TMZ.

While it is unclear whether the star will serve as a 'full-time housewife or just a friend of the show to start,' the outlet claimed she has begun filming. 

 Shaw is a international public speaker, entrepreneur and two-time cancer survivor. 

On her website, Shaw writes that she is a 'regular on ABC 7's Good Morning Washington DC' and 'is on a mission to shift mindsets and inspire actions with her powerful story.'

Filming: While it is unclear whether the star is a 'full-time housewife or just a friend of the show to start,' TMZ revealed the podcast host has begun filming (pictured in May 2019 at Race To Erase MS in Beverly Hills)

After a battle with stage 4 breast cancer and being told she had only three months to live, the podcast host learned how to stare adversity in the face and leveraged that experience to create her signature 'Warrior Method.' 

'I didn't want to be "the sick girl" at 33,' she told The Huffington Post in 2014, five years after her diagnosis. 'I didn't want to be the girl who needed sympathy and empathy.' 

The Love In The City actress continued that two years after that initial diagnosis, just weeks before her wedding, she learned her cancer had returned. 

Lack of representation: While less than half of New York City is white, 100 percent of the RHONY cast has been, apart from Jules Wainstein's stint on the show in 2016. (l-r) Tinsley Mortimer, Dorinda Medley, Luann de Lesseps, Sonja Morgan, Ramona Singer, Leah McSweeney

'I was literally praying every day, "Please don't take my life, God. Please. This is not my time,"' Bershan noted, before clarifying she is now cancer-free. 

While she has not confirmed the exciting news of her next project, on Thursday she teased a special announcement. 

'I don’t ever stop I make money moves. Don’t stop your hustle. Even during the pandemic. Find your grind,' Shaw told her nearly 70,000 Instagram followers.   

Mixing things up: The last season includedde Lesseps, Singer, Morgan, Medley, Tinsley Mortimer and McSweeney 

While less than half of New York City is white, 100 percent of the RHONY cast has been, apart from Jules Wainstein's brief stint on the show in 2016.  

The 38-year-old daughter of a Jewish father and Japanese mother, however, only lasted one season. 

The last season included Luann de Lesseps, Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley, Tinsley Mortimer and Leah McSweeney. 

Neither Medley nor Mortimer are returning for the 13th season. 

From the beginning: RHONY has shown viewers a nearly all-white cast, since it premiered in 2008 (pictured is the original cast in 2009)

RHONY's most recent addition, McSweeney, spoke about hoping future seasons will hold 'not only diversity of race, but an even deeper diversity of where someone lives or what their interests are.'

The Married To The Mob founder told Page Six in August, 'I hope that there’s just more diversity all across the board because New Yorkers are not a monolith, obviously. I think that it is gonna head in that direction.'

She continued: 'I have a lot of black friends, and I hear a lot of stories from them about racism and the sh*t they have to deal with. But, it never stops being shocking and appalling to hear someone’s personal stories'
