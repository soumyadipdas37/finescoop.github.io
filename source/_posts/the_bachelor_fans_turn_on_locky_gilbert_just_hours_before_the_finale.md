The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert will be forced to choose between Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis on Thursday night.

But a dramatic teaser for the finale shows the 30-year-old confidently confessing his love for both women on their final dates together.

Bachelor fans have slammed Locky for telling both Bella and Irena he's falling in love with them and labelled him as 'immature'.

'I don't agree with his telling them both he loves them pretty silly poor girls heading for heartbreak,' one person wrote on Facebook.

'To be honest - I would not want a man who was in love with another woman at the same time as me – and struggled to chose between us,' another person wrote.

Another agreed: 'It's not true soul love if you are in love with two women. True love is the one and only, Locky is the emotionally immature one, not the girls.'

'Locky is in love with the idea of being in love. Being in love with two people is not real love. He has no idea what being in love is. I couldn't be with someone who isn't solely in love with me,' one person said.

'Telling them both he was in love is so cringeworthy. So now one leaves more hurt due to false hope. The other wins knowing he loves another woman. Sounds like a lose lose situation to me and utterly selfish thing to do,' another commented.

In the dramatic trailer for Thursday night's finale, Locky breaks down in tears as he's forced to make the heart-breaking decision to let one person go and pick his winner.

The decision is even more difficult given that the 30-year-old confidently tells both beauties that he's falling in love with them on their final dates together.

Locky tells the cameras: 'I thought I would come here and meet one person that I like and then end up together. But I found two!

'They are two of the most incredible women that I've ever met in my entire life.' 

A short scene in the teaser also shows Locky telling a delighted Irena: 'I have fallen in love with you' - before he utters the same words to Bella on their own date.
