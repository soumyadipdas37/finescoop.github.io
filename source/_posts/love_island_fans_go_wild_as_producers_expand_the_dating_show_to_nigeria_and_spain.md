Love Island fans have gone wild on Twitter as producers have expanded the dating show to Nigeria and Spain.

The UK version of the franchise, which is usually filmed in the Spanish island of Mallorca, took a break this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A representative for ITV has announced that Nigerian network Digital Play will be picking up the format, while Atresmedia commissioned the first Spanish language version of the show, produced by Boomerang.

Since the series was revived four years ago, the much-loved programme has spawned several international versions. 

Love Island Denmark and Netherlands only survived for one season each between 2018 and 2019, while the editions in Germany, Netherlands and Belgium, and the United States are currently on air.

The show has also been adapted in Poland, Romania, New Zealand, Hungary, Finland, France, Sweden and Australia.

According to Metro, the first Nigerian season will air on TVC for terrestrial and on 9 Vision Media for digital.

It is unclear when both Nigerian and Spanish versions will air due to the coronavirus pandemic. MailOnline has reached out to a Love Island spokesperson for further comment.

Fans took to social media to share their delight over the upcoming series as they wrote: 'Love Island Nigeria will be the first one to have a man coupling up with two women because he loves them both dearly.









'It's going to be hilarious': Fans took to social media to share their delight over the upcoming series

'The chaotic energy that will be Love Island Nigeria will need to be injected straight into my veins. 

'Love Island Nigeria is gonna be hilarious looooool.

'Nigeria is getting Love Island. Entertainment industry in Nigeria is top 1 in Africa. 

'Lowkey I’m now excited for Love Island in Nigeria ...can you imagine the drama when they come back from Casa Amor.' (sic)

In June, ITV announced the network axed the winter series of UK's Love Island, with the show returning to screens in summer 2021.

 'Love Island UK will return bigger and better than ever with an extended run in summer 2021,' ITV announced in a statement to MailOnline. 

The axing of both the summer 2020 series and a winter series in early 2021 is in large part down to the coronavirus pandemic, with restrictions on travel and filming causing huge issues for the show.

The first ever winter series of the show gave ITV2 its best ever January and February ratings with an average 3.1m viewers.
