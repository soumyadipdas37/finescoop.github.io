She always looks sensational whenever she steps out.

And Maya Jama was sure to flaunt her sizzling curves as she enjoyed a night out with pals at Annabel's in London on Wednesday.

The TV and radio host, 26, looked sensational as she rocked a skin-tight white dress with a ruched detail on the sides.

Wow: Maya Jama looked sensational as she flaunted her sizzling curves during a night out with pals at Annabel's in London on Wednesday

Maya put on a leggy display in the stylish dress which boasted a high-neck line and long sleeves to emphasise her toned arms.

The beauty added some extra height to her frame with a pair of strappy black heels with a black and white striped pattern under her perfectly polished toes.

She wore her long dark locks tied into a high ponytail, letting the bottom half of her hair cascade in perfectly styled waves over her shoulders. 

Not forgetting to accessories, Maya toted a tiny white Balenciaga handbag and added some chic hoop earrings to complete her ensemble.

The night out comes after Maya graced the cover of Wonderland Magazine for a sensational new shoot with an accompanying interview detailing her feelings on the industry and how she will struggle with acting 

Maya said: 'I definitely think I'm resilient. Sometimes I surprise myself, because there's been a few times...

'I feel like oh my God, this is the end of the world — and then it's not the end of the world. And then I'm back.'

Maya also recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it's like, 'This is this, it's everybody's business'.

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heavy Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire.'
