Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is facing more than two years behind bars should he be convicted in his World Cup TV rights bribery trial. 

Al-Khelaifi is accused of offering former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke use of his villa in Sardinia, Italy, as a favour ahead of the television rights process for the 2026 and 2030 competitions.

The Swiss Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona was told on Tuesday that beIN Media Group was awarded the rights in Middle East and Africa, without being put up for tender. Al-Khelaifi is also the chairman of the Qatari broadcast group.

According to reports from the proceedings, Valcke requested the help of buying the Italian house during the negotiations between FIFA and beIN.

Al-Khelaifi then bought the property for €5million, before handing it over to a close associate's borther, from whom Valcke gained access to it.

Prosecutors have called for a 28-mont sentence for Al-Khelaifi if he is found guilty. They have asked for a three-year sentence for Valcke if the same verdict is passed on him.
