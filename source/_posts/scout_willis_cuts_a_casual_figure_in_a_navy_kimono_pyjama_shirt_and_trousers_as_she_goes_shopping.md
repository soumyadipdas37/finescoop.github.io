She is the daughter of Hollywood mega-stars Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.

She opted for a chic pair of black leather mules and draped her scarlet tassel handbag over her shoulder as she adjusted her face mask. 

The brunette kept things simple on the jewellery front with a delicate silver necklace.

She styled her hair in a low bun and let her natural beauty shine through with a minimal make-up look.

Scout's famous father Bruce Willis , 65, also ventured out for a walk near his Los Angeles home on Thursday. 

His casual ensemble consisted of a chocolate-coloured tee and and acid wash jeans.

That same day, his ex-wife Demi Moore, 57, shared a heart-warming Throwback Thursday snap of her as a little girl, from her book Inside Out.

Demi shared an undated black and white photo of her in an adorable playsuit.  

As she celebrated the one-year anniversary of the book, she said on social media: 'Little Demi, moment of joy! from#TBT from #InsideOutBook.'

The Hollywood actress shares a striking resemblance to Scout, and her other two daughters, Rumer, 32, and Tallulah, 26.
