West Ham hope to sign Slavia Prague full-back Vladimir Coufal following his medical on Thursday but have been rebuffed in bids for Bruges midfielder Hans Vanaken and Fiorentina defender Nikola Milenkovic.

Manager David Moyes is keen to strengthen his squad but with a limited budget is mindful of wasting money afforded to him.

Should they fail to find suitable options he is prepared to hold fire on major signings until January rather than make rash decisions.

West Ham are close to signing of Slavia Prague's Vladimir Coufal ahead a medical on Thursday

Right-back Coufal is in London and likely to cost around £4million and his expected transfer was confirmed by Slavia Prague’s president Jaroslav Tvrdik on Wednesday.

Bruges rejected an offer of £15m plus add ons for 28-year old Vanaken, a prolific goal scoring midfielder, who Moyes had identified as an ideal support for his attack.

Fiorentina rebuffed West Ham’s £22m bid for Milenkovic but were willing to negotiate. However, it is understood the demands of the player and his representatives were considered too high for West Ham to proceed.

Moyes is still working through options and has left room for late loans prior to Monday’s 11pm deadline. 

There is also the chance to sign from EFL clubs in the domestic window that runs until 5pm on October 16.

He knows Chelsea are willing to offer players plus cash in return for Declan Rice but is adamant the England international will not be sold this window.
