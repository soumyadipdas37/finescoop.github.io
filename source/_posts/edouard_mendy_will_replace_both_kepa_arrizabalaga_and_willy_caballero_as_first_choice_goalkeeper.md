Edouard Mendy will be in the Chelsea squad for the first time at Tottenham tomorrow.

But Frank Lampard has hit out at some of the ‘unfair’ criticism of the man Mendy has been bought to challenge, Kepa Arrizabalaga.

Goalkeeper Mendy joined for £22m from Rennes last week though Saturday’s trip to West Brom was considered too soon for his first involvement.

However, Lampard has hit out at some of the ‘unfair’ criticism of under-fire Kepa Arrizabalaga

That will be at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium tonight where Chelsea head for their Carabao Cup fourth round tie.

Lampard said: ‘Mendy and [Ben] Chilwell are in the squad so they are fit, so we will see if they start or not. Very positive, the early signs and interactions [with Mendy], just as a man and also on the training pitch. 

'He has settled in very well in those few days and we’ve made him very welcome, as always so it is competition. He is a good goalkeeper. We know that. We know a lot about him and we will see how we go.’

Mendy’s arrival came just a few days after Kepa suffered another setback when a poor attempted pass out gifted Liverpool a second goal in their 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge, increasing the scrutiny of the Spaniard.

Kepa was then left out of the 3-3 draw at West Brom on Saturday, his place taken by Willy Caballero.

Lampard added: ‘No, I certainly won’t go to the point that he has played his last game for Chelsea.

‘It has been a difficult time for Kepa. I think that is well-documented. I know it and he knows it but we should certainly not jump to that conclusion and also I think, which I felt quite strongly about in the last week, is also understand that Kepa is a young man and a lot of the highlight and spotlight on him has become unfair.

‘I have to protect him because he is a good lad playing with absolute professionalism and intent to do the best he can as all the squad have to and that’s as much as I want to say about it now.’
