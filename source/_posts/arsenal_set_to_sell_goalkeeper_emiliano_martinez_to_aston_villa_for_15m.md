Arsenal have reportedly decided to sell goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to Aston Villa.

According to The Independent, Villa are set to make an improvement on their initial offer of £15million for Martinez.

The 28-year-old seized his opportunity when Bernd Leno was injured towards the end of last season and helped Arsenal to win the FA Cup.

However, Martinez wanted guarantees that he would play regularly for Arsenal this season and reportedly turned down the offer of a new contract from the Gunners.

Martinez is said to have agreed personal terms with Villa on a four year contract which would see him earn around £60,000-a-week.

Leno, who featured for Germany against Switzerland last weekend, is poised to start the season as Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper and is set to feature away to Fulham on Saturday.

Martinez joined Arsenal as a youngster in 2010 and had to be extremely patient for opportunities to impress as he was sent out on loan on six occasions.

Prior to last season he had made just 14 appearances for the Gunners but he featured 23 times in 2019-20 and also played in the Community Shield success against Liverpool last month.
