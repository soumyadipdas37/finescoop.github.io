Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed Harry Maguire will remain Manchester United's captain despite his summer incident in Greece.

Maguire, 27, was handed a suspended prison sentence of 21 months and 10 days following an altercation outside a nightclub on the island of Mykonos last month.

The England international was found guilty of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and repeated attempts of bribery.

Maguire has appealed the verdict and there will be a full retrial at a later date.

But while Maguire was dropped from the England squad by manager Gareth Southgate for last week's internationals, his status as United captain will not change.

Manager Solskjaer told United's official website: 'Of course Harry had a difficult summer.

'He didn't have a long break. His break was different to others as we gave him a few more days and, after, he's come back and looked fine.

'He's handled it really well and, of course, I'll be here to support him.

'He is going to be our captain. We'll just leave Harry and his people and the process to run.

'For me, he is a top, an absolute top, human being and has always been a positive guy with the right values.

'So I really hope we can see Harry performing at his best.'

The centre-back played every minute of United's Premier League campaign last season as well as making 17 appearances in other competitions.

United don't begin their Premier League season until next Saturday's visit of Crystal Palace to Old Trafford after being given an extension to pre-season following their run to the Europa League semi-finals next month.

They will play Aston Villa in a friendly match at Villa Park on Saturday as Solskjaer prepares his players for the new campaign.

Maguire admitted he was 'scared for his life' when arrested by police officers in Mykonos 

Maguire has admitted he feared for his life when Greek police arrested him in Mykonos and thought he was being kidnapped.

He told the BBC: 'They hit me a lot on the legs. I was in that much of a panic. Fear. Scared for my life.'
