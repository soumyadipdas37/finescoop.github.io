Alice Lamb is a writer, unmarried and living alone in a windswept cottage on the south coast during the Second World War. 

She has a sharp tongue, long, wild hair, and the local children whisper that she's a spy.

One summer's day Alice finds, to her horror, that she is to host an evacuee from London, 11-year-old Frank, who is already on the doorstep. 

'We've all got to do our bit,' the Billeting Officer reminds Alice sternly, leaving Frank in Alice's unwilling care. 

Alice's life is about to change in ways she could never imagine. 

And as Gemma Arterton, who stars as Alice in the film Summerland, says, between the cracking good story, the characters and the glorious location on the cliffs of the English coastline, how could she resist being part of it?

Gemma Arterton stars as Alice in the film Summerland and describes the film as a love story

'I had an immediate emotional reaction to it,' she says of the script when we talk by video from the London home she shares with her husband, actor Rory Keenan. 

It came with excellent credentials, having as its writer her friend and neighbour, playwright Jessica Swale, who had already directed both Gemma and co-star Gugu Mbatha-Raw in her Olivier Award-winning stage play Nell Gwynn.

'When I first read it I didn't know I'd play Alice, I just knew I wanted to be part of it somehow. 

'I'd studied the war at school, and grew up knowing about evacuees because my grandmother was evacuated from London, so that story was a huge part of our lives.'

The film is not only about an evacuee, however. Important to the plot is the love Alice had shared 15 years before with her soulmate, the beautiful, witty and impeccably stylish Vera (Gugu). 

'It's a love story,' says Gemma simply. 

'And it happens to be between two women. We didn't want to make it a big deal that they were lesbians – there's an element of, "Oh, gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could all just be with whoever we liked," but that wasn't really a talking point here.

'Actually, the reason that Alice and Vera can't be together is because one of them can't give the other one the baby she wants. That's a whole other topic.'

Nevertheless, she does acknowledge that, in the 1940s two women in love would have been unacceptable to most people. 

'There's a lovely scene where Alice asks Frank if he's shocked by her sexuality, and he just accepts it, like, "Of course it's not weird – why would it be weird to love someone?" That's what we wanted to show in this film.

'It's the way I grew up. My mum's sister, Aunt Sarah, is gay, and it was never a big deal: she and my mum are very close, and we were always hanging out with her friends and her girlfriends. 

'I think a lot of the homophobia that exists comes when people are not mixing with a certain set of people, they're not humanising them, or seeing them as normal people. 

'That was never a thing for me.'

The film also has a determinedly colourblind philosophy: Gugu is of African descent, many of the villagers are West Indian or Indian, and Lucas Bond, who plays Frank, is of mixed race. 

'We wanted to show all sorts of people and how they could live together. 

'Jess feels very strongly about casting colourblind – after all, she cast Gugu as Nell Gwynn in her debut big play. 

'The reason we cast Gugu as Vera is she was the perfect person to play her.'

She adds that no less care was taken in the search for the perfect Frank. 

'We auditioned many kids, but there was something about Lucas – he was very intelligent and switched on, which felt very right for Frank. 

'I felt I could talk to him like an adult, and our relationship developed like Alice and Frank's does, into good friends.'

The location is as much of a character as the actors. 

The Seven Sisters cliffs of East Sussex are the backdrop, and Alice's home is an old coastguard cottage between Seaford and Eastbourne, a real fairy-tale dwelling. 

Gemma was due to follow Summerland with The King's Man, a lavish prequel to the Kingsman series, but its release has been put back to 2021

And if it looks familiar from the outside, there's a reason for that.

'Remember at the end of Atonement, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley's characters were going to meet again at this idyllic house they'd seen on a postcard? 

Well, one of our producers had worked on Atonement, and he read the script then said, 'I know just the house we need!'

Later this year she'll be seen in the BBC mini-series Black Narcissus, the story of a group of nuns moving to an old Himalayan palace.

She says she dealt with lockdown better than expected. 

'It wasn't easy, especially at the beginning. But it's also been enriching, and brought a lot of us closer together. 

'I've been speaking to my mum on the phone every day, usually I only would once a week.

'And I've been having quizzes once a week with friends from grammar school – we were starting to grow apart but now we're much closer.'

She admits that, where she and Rory were concerned, she was a little anxious about how it would turn out. 

'I like being on my own a lot, and so does he, but we've found a way of living together that's been really great. 

'We've been creating work together. He wrote a film I'll be in, which is exciting.'

The couple are not alone in the house. An enthusiastic young spaniel lollops onto her lap, gazing up adoringly. 

'That's Luca,' she says. 'He's my baby. He's been sitting next to me while we've been talking, though he hates it when I'm on the laptop.'

She smiles down at the dog, mirroring his affection. 'He's a real mummy's boy,' she says proudly.
