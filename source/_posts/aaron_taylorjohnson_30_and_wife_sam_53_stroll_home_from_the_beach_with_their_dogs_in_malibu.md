They are based in Los Angeles with their two children Wylda Rae and Romy Hero.

And Aaron Taylor-Johnson spent some quality time with wife Sam as they enjoyed a day at the beach with their two dogs in Malibu on Wednesday.

The Avengers: Age Of Ultron actor, 30, cut a casual figure in floral swimming trunks as he strolled along with his equally casually dressed wife, 53.

Aaron was suitably dressed for his day at the beach, teaming his shorts with a dark grey T-shirt, a brown sports cap and a grey sweater tied around his waist.

The film star completed his relaxed look with bare feet as he enjoyed his idyllic walk home with his wife and pets.

Sam meanwhile echoed her husband's low-key look, opting for a loose-fitting white sweater, black shorts and brown sandals.

The director added a black sports cap and carried what appeared to be a bodyboard under her arm.

Aaron and his wife Sam met on the set of the 2009 John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy, which Sam directed, when she was 42 and he was 18.

The English pair announced their engagement later that year and married in 2012 with a ceremony in Somerset, England.

At the time of their first collaboration, Aaron went by the surname Johnson, while Sam went by Taylor-Wood, but both adopted the married name Taylor-Johnson.

The lovebirds returned to collaborating in 2018 with their adaptation of James Frey's pseudo-memoir A Million Little Pieces.

The couple wrote the film together, making it Aaron's first credited screenwriting gig.

He starred in the movie as Frey, who's sent to a rehab center after suffering a serious fall while under the influence of drugs.

Aaron currently stars in the hotly-anticipated Christopher Nolan thriller Tenet, one of the  first big blockbuster to be released post-lockdown.
