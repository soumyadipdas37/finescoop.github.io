Selena Gomez has been working nearly her entire life as she started acting at age eight when she was on the children's show Barney And Friends.

That led to a starring role on Wizards Of Waverly Place and roles in Disney movies as well as a stellar singing career that included hit songs like Come And Get It.

Now the Rare makeup mogul has told the October issue of Allure that she felt she was over sexualized in some of her music videos.

Ready to roll: Selena Gomez talked to the October issue of Allure about feeling over sexualized in music videos when she was younger

Too much! 'I just did things that weren't really me. There was pressure to seem more adult on my album, Revival. [I felt] the need to show skin... I really don't think I was [that] person,' said the performer

'I just did things that weren't really me. There was pressure to seem more adult on my album, Revival. [I felt] the need to show skin... I really don't think I was [that] person,' said the ex-girlfriend of Justin Bieber and The Weeknd.

Revival was the second full-length studio album by Gomez. It was released in 2015 when she was 23-years-old. 

She was nude on the album cover and also very sexual in the videos for Hands To Myself and Good For You.

So much skin: Her image for the album was one of a sexy pop star; the album was an instant hit

But these days she has control over her work - which includes movies, music, producing documentaries and her new makeup line - and she is loving being an 'entrepreneur.'   

Gomez stated: 'It's more that I am in control. I am in full control of my life and everything that I do, what is out there, everything. So I would like to say, yes. I'm in charge of everything in my life.' 

The stress of her massive career led to a break two years ago causing her to check into a mental health facility.

She is the boss: But these days she has control over her work - which includes movies, music, producing documentaries and her new makeup line - and she is loving being an 'entrepreneur'

She hit the pause button years ago: 'I have always had so many different emotions and I didn't know how to control them quite well,' she said. 'It was complicated'

'I have always had so many different emotions and I didn't know how to control them quite well,' she said.

'It was complicated. But I think I'm happy to understand it. Once I did find out more about who I was, I was proud. I also felt comfortable knowing that I wasn't alone, and I was going to get through it. So I will always be passionate about that. It's something I will continue to talk about.'

One of the things Selena learned was to not take social media too seriously.

And now she refrains from Googling herself.

She matured: 'It was complicated. But I think I'm happy to understand it. Once I did find out more about who I was, I was proud,' said the star

'I haven't done that in years. I honestly can't. I'm strong in a lot of ways, but I think I just have way too much of a sensitive heart,' she added.

But she did return to Instagram to move along the Black Lives Matter movement.

'There was so much that I didn't know. I was so upset with how people were being treated, and having people in my life that have dealt with that for years, telling me stories that they've never told me before,' said the brunette.

She does not Google herself: 'I haven't done that in years. I honestly can't. I'm strong in a lot of ways, but I think I just have way too much of a sensitive heart,' she added

'That's why what I did with my social media was extremely important — having all of these different voices share their experiences. I didn't want to be someone that was going to just post something [or make a] donation.'

Last year she produced the Netflix documentary Living Undocumented.

The show follows the lives of real families being torn apart by current U.S. immigration policies:

'It made me mad,' said the star.

'I knew I related to that in so many ways. A lot of my family were immigrants, and created lives for themselves here. I'm just once removed from being an [immigrant]. I'm proud of that side of who I am. 

'But seeing what happened [to the families in the documentary], I just felt helpless — completely disgusted and frustrated — and I wanted to do something that would make people uncomfortable, that would force people to watch something that maybe they just don't want to see, or don't understand.'

Her new beauty line: She has come out with the label Rare; seen in a promo shot in August
