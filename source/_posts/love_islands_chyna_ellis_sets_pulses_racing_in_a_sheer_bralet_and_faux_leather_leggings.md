The Love Island beauty rose to fame on the ITV reality show but failed to find love, so she began dating Ibiza Weekender's Jordan Davies after exiting the Mallorcan villa. 

Their blossoming romance was documented on the reality show that took place in a Ibiza holiday resort, but they suffered an acrimonious breakup in 2017.

Chyna claimed Jordan was 'too intense' after they finished recording Ibiza Weekender and was 'bitter' after she broke things off.

The reality starlet also blasted his skills under the sheets and divulged he wasn't as good as she expected, given his claims that he has slept with over 1,500 people. 

In a 2018 interview with The Sun, she said: 'The sex with Jordan wasn't that great, I'm not going to lie. Considering he's shagged over 1,500 people which is quite disgusting anyway. I was expecting something a little more. 

Chyna added: 'He would come down to mine in Essex quite a lot and it got to the point where he was constantly coming to see me. It was just too much for me.

'It was more on his part than mine. So I just told him a few times saying, "let's keep it cool, let's take it easy, take it slow". He did say at one point he wanted to marry me and I thought "wow"... It was too much for such little time.'
