Female drill instructors may start training recruits at the Marine Corps' historically all-male recruit depot in San Diego, part of a year-long congressional mandate requiring entry-level training coed for the Marines. 

Commandant Gen. David Berger made the announcement on Thursday during an event hosted by Defense One, Military.com reports. 

'All of our female drill instructors are on the East Coast,' he said. '... We're going to run a couple trials this wintertime actually moving drill instructors from South Carolina to San Diego [on temporary duty] and train recruits on the West Coast to see how this is going to work.' 

Female drill instructors train at the Marine Corps' East Coast schoolhouse, eventually leading recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. 

On Thursday, Commandant Gen. David Berger said that trials to see how female drill instructors do in San Diego will begin during the wintertime.  It is currently unclear the instructors assigned to San Diego in the winter will train at the drill instructor school at the West Coast or from the East Coast

It is currently unclear the instructors who will be assigned to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in the winter will train at the drill instructor school at the West Coast or be transferred from Parris Island. 

Under the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, the service is required to stop separating trainees by gender at Parris Island within five years and within eight in San Diego.

Berger explained that the requirement would be a struggle to attain as half od all enlistees who train on the West Coast 'never see a female recruit at all.'

'Nothing about the way we're organized right now lends itself to integrated recruit training,' he said.

Last year, the Marine Corps began training coed companies at Parris Island. The East Coast recruit depot doesn't have the space to accommodate the setup during the summer month, which see an influx of trainees following high school graduations. 

Recruits at the boot camp at Parris Island have interacted with both male and female drill instructors. 

The Marine Corps has been slammed for their practices of separating the boot camps by gender in the past.  

Recruitment training becoming coed is a 'top priority' for the Marine Corps, who released plans for ending gender segregation at boot camp earlier this month. All-male recruit companies trained solely by men are to become 'obsolete.'  

'The outcome the Marine Corps desires for gender integration is for every male recruit to train alongside a female recruit within the same company,' read the document, submitted to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.
