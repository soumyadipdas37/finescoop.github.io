Bayer Leverkusen have expressed surprise interest in signing Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin, according to reports.

The 25-year-old has also been the subject of a £30million bid from Paris Saint-Germain, and Arsenal are understood to recognise that any substantial fee will allow them to reinvest.

Leverkusen will attempt to push for European silverware next season and The Telegraph report the Bundesliga outfit may swoop for Bellerin to boost their chances.

Bellerin remains Arsenal's first-choice right back but could find himself leaving with the north London club still hoping to be active in the market.

He remains under contract until 2023 but Sportsmail have previously reported that he is open to taking up a new challenge.

The money raised from Kai Havertz's move to Chelsea this week will strengthen Leverkusen's hopes of signing an experienced right back, with Tottenham's Serge Aurier also on their radar.

Paris Saint-Germain have offered £30million for the right back with talks expected to continue

Both Juventus and Champions League winners Bayern Munich are also thought to admire Bellerin, alongside Leverkusen, but PSG have made the first concrete approach.

The French giants have weighed up swooping for Bellerin for a number of seasons, and their initial package was worth £25m with a further £5m in add-ons. 

Talks are expected to continue, however, with Arsenal holding out for a greater fee.

Bellerin moved to the Emirates from Barcelona's famed academy in 2011 and has since made 205 appearances across all competitions.
