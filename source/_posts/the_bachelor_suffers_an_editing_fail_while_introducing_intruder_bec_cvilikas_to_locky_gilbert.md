Bachelor Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert was thrilled to meet intruder Bec Cvilikas on Wednesday night's episode.  

But the program suffered an awkward editing fail while introducing the senior beauty consultant to viewers. 

While the blonde bombshell shared details of her life with Locky over Zoom, there was one jarring element that didn't add up to viewers.

That doesn't add up! The Bachelor suffered an awkward editing fail on Wednesday night's episode while introducing intruder Bec Cvilikas (pictured) to Locky Gilbert over Zoom

Wearing a grey long-sleeve shirt, Bec was all smiles as she struck up a conversation with Locky over the video-sharing app during the 'Love In Lockdown' episode.

When asked to divulge more information about herself, she began: 'Ok. Well, I'm 25. I've lived on the Sunshine Coast pretty much nearly my whole life, and I played Rugby League as well for four years.'

However, just a few seconds later in a piece-to-camera, Bec is shown wearing an orange dress with a caption that read: 'Bec, 24, Senior Beauty Consultant.'

Bec's 25th birthday occurred in January, so by the time of filming her Zoom meeting with Locky she had been 25 for a couple of months.

Her correct age is displayed on Channel 10's Bachelor website.

Did YOU spot the error? Just a few seconds after telling Locky she was 25, Bec's Bachelor bio claimed she was 24. Her 25th birthday was in January, months before her Zoom date 

Not happy: The remaining girls admitted they felt threatened by Bec's presence, and Roxi Kenny (pictured) insinuated that she believed the blonde wasn't there for genuine reasons

Meanwhile, Bec's arrival generated plenty of drama among the cast. 

The remaining girls admitted they felt threatened by her presence, and Roxi Kenny even insinuated that she wasn't there for genuine reasons. 

Some of the show's devoted viewers also complained that it was too late into the series to introduce a new lady into the mix.

Coming up roses! Former Survivor hunk Locky chose to keep Bec as one of the remaining nine ladies to continue the show at the Bachelor mansion in Sydney
