Paulini Curuenavuli  has announced the tragic death of her father Isireli after a health battle.

The singer, 37, shared the devastating news to Instagram on Friday, and said she'll be 'forever grateful for the sacrifices he made for her family'.

'I have received some emails and messages in regard to my absence from all things social of late... My family and I have been spending precious time at the bedside of my Father – Isireli Curuenavuli,' she wrote.

'But our Fijian loving Warrior fought his last battle yesterday, 17th September 2020,' she said.

'My adored "Deddy" is now among the angels in heaven. Although he has left this earth it does not mean he is gone, because those we love never really leave us— they may no longer pass our eyes, but they will never leave our hearts,' she added.

Paulini went on to say: 'I already miss him, his smile attitude and wisdom and will every day.'

'I am and will forever be grateful for the sacrifices he made for the betterment of our family. And I will forever sing for him,' she ended.

Australian singer Anthony Callea replied to Paulini's heartbreaking post, writing: 'So sorry to hear this Paulini, sending much strength and light your way'.

Meanwhile, Paulini rose to fame after appearing on Australian Idol back  in 2003.

After her appearance on the show, Paulini claimed a rough patch in her life led her to make poor choices.

'I went through a very traumatic breakup from a tumultuous relationship,' she wrote in a letter to the court, obtained by The Daily Telegraph in January 2018. 

'I am embarrassed to say this was not the first relationship I had been in involving domestic violence and low self-esteem. 

'In addition to the breakdown of my relationship, my failed album release had cost me my savings and the relationship with the record label.'

But Paulini appears to have since gotten her life back on track, appearing as the lead in The Bodyguard musical, and being revealed as the Spider on The Masked Singer in 2019.
