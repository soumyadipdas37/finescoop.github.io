Britain today recorded 10 more coronavirus deaths in the preliminary count, with all of the fatalities occurring in England.

Health officials have yet to confirm the final daily figure, which takes into account data from every setting across the UK. The early count for England only includes laboratory-confirmed victims in NHS-ran hospitals.

Yesterday, the virus claimed 17 more lives - down from 34 on Saturday - although fatalities are normally lower on Sundays and Mondays due to a lag in the way they are recorded in hospitals.  

Today's jump means Britain's coronavirus death toll stands at 41,998, the worst in Europe, with only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico recording more fatalities.
