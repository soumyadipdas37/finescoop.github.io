Her romance with Dino Hira was a disaster on Married At First Sight last year.

But Melissa Lucarelli didn't mind being the third wheel as Elizabeth Sobinoff and Seb Guilhaus posed for a newlywed photo shoot in Sydney on Thursday.

After packing on the PDA with personal trainer Seb, former jewellery store manager Lizzie, swapped her high heels for a pair of comfortable Ugg boots.

Lizzie, 29, wowed in her form-fitting white satin gown which boasted draped detailing across her chest. 

The brunette tied her locks into a loose bun, and framed her striking features with a pair of dangling silver earrings.   

Meanwhile, Seb put on a dapper display in a crisp white shirt and black suit.

The pair met while starring on the seventh season of Married At First Sight in 2020.

They reunited in June after being forced to spend months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Elizabeth spoke about living with her boyfriend of seven months while appearing on the podcast Fashion Avenue.

'I mean, it's just normal to get frustrated with everyone,' she confessed, but added that she was 'loving' being with Seb in Sydney.

She added: 'I'm actually in such a great place in my life at the moment. He's just amazing! And it's that bonding.'

Lizzie explained she'd been staying with Seb, 31, at his home in Adelaide before the state borders closed and she was forced to return to NSW for work.

She said they ultimately ended up spending three months apart, but stayed connected through 'constant texting'.
