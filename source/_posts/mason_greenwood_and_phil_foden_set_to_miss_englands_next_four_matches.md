Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood arrived back in Manchester on Monday night amid reports they will miss England's next four matches.

The Three Lions pair broke coronavirus guidelines by inviting two Icelandic girls to their team hotel whilst on international duty.

The young stars, who had both made their debuts in the win over Iceland on Saturday, were sent home ahead of England's game against Denmark on Tuesday and will also be kept out of the squad matches against Wales, Belgium and Denmark again next month as punishment, according to The Sun.

Icelandic police have now fined the duo 250,000 Icelandic Krona (£1,300) for the rule breach during the coronavirus pandemic, which must be paid by the individuals themselves and not by the FA or their clubs.

Manchester United's Greenwood, 18, and Manchester City's Foden, 20, made their senior international debuts in the win over Iceland on Saturday - but those accomplishments have now been overshadowed, with footage now emerging on social media of the women in question arranging a meet-up with the young stars.

In the video the Icelandic girls, one of whom is 20-year-old model Nadia Sif Lindal Gunnarsdottir, ask how the stars are going to sneak them into the hotel.

At the other end of the line, Foden could be heard responding: 'What you coming to the hotel for?', before Greenwood appears to say to his team-mate in the background: 'what do you think?'

The young duo were photographed in the hotel room by the girls who stopped by to visit them

Later footage then shows the footballers with the model and her cousin and best friend Lara Clausen, a 19-year-old law student. 

One of the girls has apologised for her part in the incident, saying she felt 'really, really, really bad'. 

She told MailOnline: 'I feel really sorry for him and I never wanted to put them in that position but we didn't know any better and we didn't know that they were quarantining, or else we wouldn't have gone to meet them.

'We didn't even know who Phil was. I asked Phil who he was. I'm not that much into football. I don't watch football at all.

'We didn't even know that Mason played for Man United. 

She added: 'We haven't spoken to them since. We don't want to interrupt them because they are of course going through a lot right now. They haven't contacted us.

'It was a good night that we had, of course. We were all the four of us spending time together and getting to know each other. They were nice guys. Really, really nice.'

Foden has since released a statement, in which he apologised to England, City and his family

An FA Spokesman said on Monday: 'Whilst in Iceland, both Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood spent time outside of our private team area, which was a breach of our COVID-19 rules.

'While they did not leave the team hotel, it was an unacceptable breach of our protocol. They have both apologised for their serious lack of judgement.

'The FA will be launching a full investigation into the circumstances leading up to this breach. We have spoken to the Iceland FA to offer our apologies for this incident and to ensure them that we are taking the appropriate steps. 

'We have also assured the Danish FA that all other players and staff members have been isolated within our group throughout this period.

'Our immediate priority now is preparing the team for the match against Denmark tomorrow.'
