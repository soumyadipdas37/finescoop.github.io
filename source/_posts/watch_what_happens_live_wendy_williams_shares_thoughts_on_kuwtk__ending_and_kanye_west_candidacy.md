Wendy Williams shared her thoughts Sunday on the imminent end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Kanye West running for US president.

The 56-year-old daytime talk show host during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live was asked about recent pop culture moments by host Andy Cohen, 52, during a segment titled Don't Mask Your Opinions.

Andy while wearing a green screen face mask with superimposed images asked Wendy for her opinion on KUWTK coming to an end.

'Good for them. They had a good run and now they can make all of their money with their social media followers and Kim definitely has got it in spades. She can slowly work on her divorce and life goes on,' Wendy responded as she referenced Kim Kardashian, 39, and her husband Kanye, 43.

Andy later asked for her response to Kanye running for US president.

'With the Birthday Party, are you part of that? No, Kanye, sit down and be well. Sit down, Kanye, and be well and figure out your life,' Wendy replied.

Kanye announced on July 4 on Twitter that he was running in the 2020 presidential election and told Forbes that he was campaigning as an independent under the Birthday Party 'because when we win, it's everybody's birthday'.

It was reported earlier this month that Kanye received assistance from Republican Party operatives to secure ballot access in some states and the rapper has not denied that he would be a spoiler candidate in the presidential election.

The Kardashians also announced earlier this month that the family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians will come to an end in 2021 after 20 seasons.

Wendy earlier was asked by a virtual audience member to give details about her 'new man on Instagram'.

'I haven't been seeing a new man on Instagram. I've been showing you pictures of me with friends and when I do find the man-man, he will not be on my Instagram. That is one thing I will not be doing,' Wendy said.

Wendy also admitted that she 'can't wait to get back to dating I will not lie about it.'

Another virtual audience member asked if she ever regretted anything that she said on The Wendy Williams Show.

'No regrets,' replied Wendy.

Wendy filed for divorce in April 2019 from her second husband Kevin Hunter after it was reported that he fathered a child with another woman and their divorce was finalized in January 2020.

Season 12 of The Wendy Williams Show premiered on September 21.
