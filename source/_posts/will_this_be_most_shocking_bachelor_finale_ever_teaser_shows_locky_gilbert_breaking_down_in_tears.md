Former best friends turned arch-enemies, Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis, are his final two ladies.

And in a dramatic teaser for Thursday night's finale of The Bachelor, Locky Gilbert breaks down into tears as he's forced to make the heart-breaking decision to let one go and pick his winner.

The decision is even more difficult given that the teaser shows the 30-year-old confidently telling both the brunette beauties that he's falling in love with them on their final dates together.
