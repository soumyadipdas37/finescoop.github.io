A grandfather who allegedly raped his own daughter is also accused of sexually abusing his granddaughter and using her for child porn.

The 53-year-old faced court on Tuesday for allegedly abusing his nine-year-old daughter for two years from 1997, the Townsville Bulletin reported.

A decade later, the man from Townsville in north Queensland, allegedly began sexually assaulting his eight-year-old granddaughter.

Police alleged he abused her and penetrated her with objects in restaurants and public spaces around the city.

Detective Senior Sergeant Dave Miles told the publication the man allegedly used the girl to create and keep child exploitation material.

The man lived with his daughter, who is now 32, and granddaughter. 

An investigation began when the Townsville Child Protection and Investigation unit received information about the allegations.

He faced Townsville Magistrates Court on 12 counts of indecent treatment of a child, rape, attempted rape and making child exploitation material.

New charges of maintaining a sexual relationship with a child were also laid against him.
