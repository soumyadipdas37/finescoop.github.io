She is beloved by 007 fans for her memorable appearance opposite Roger Moore in The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977.

And Bond girl Susie Vanner looked nothing short of sensational as she soaked up the sun while on holiday in St Tropez, France on Saturday.

The actress, 69, donned a bright red bikini as she sunbathed on a boat while making the most of her trip.

Styling her blonde locks into a ponytail, Susie chatted with a group of friends as she kicked back and relaxed on the French Riviera. 

Showing off her tan, the film star completed her look for the outing with a simple gold necklace and matching watch.  

Susie is remembered for her portrayal of the Log Cabin Girl in Sir Roger Moore's The Spy Who Loved Me.

The character was an unnamed honeytrap who acted as bait in a Soviet attempt to assassinate Bond.

When the film was adapted for Christopher Wood's novelisation, she was given the name Martine Blanchaud.

Last year, Susie spoke out about the moment her 32-year marriage crumbled when her husband Warren Todd left her for a younger woman he met at the gym. 

The Bond star admitted she was a 'fighter' but found things 'really hard' when Warren, 54, ended their marriage to pursue a relationship with his new girlfriend, who became pregnant. 

Appearing on ITV's Lorraine, Sue told how she has found solace in music after her bitter split.

Lorraine said: 'It's a sad reason for you to go back into the music business... 32 years and he's gone off with someone else, and that's really hard.'

Susie replied: 'It's really hard, but I'm a fighter so I decided to go back into my music.'

Lorraine continued: 'So instead of sitting in the corner crying because your husband has run off with somebody whose younger, and they've now got a baby I believe…'

To which a hurt Susie quipped back: 'Not that much younger actually but never mind.'

Lorraine scoffed: 'That's almost worse. I know we're laughing about it but its really hard.'

After an awkward moment, the conversation then led to Bond, where Susie compared today's Bond to when she starred in it in 1977.  

'They are different, there’s more special effects, they’re less tongue in cheek,' she said. 'But I think they’re fantastic. It’s moving with the times.' 

Back in June, it emerged Susie's husband Warren fell in love with a much younger woman, known only as 'Anya', who is pregnant with his child.  

The multi-millionaire property tycoon, owner of a huge chunk of London's fashionable Notting Hill, moved out of the £10million Georgian mansion he shared with Susie near the Beckhams' home in Holland Park.

Warren is now living in a smaller property around the corner with his new girlfriend, who thought to be Eastern European.

A close friend told The Daily Mail at the time: 'Sue is devastated, After 32 years of happy marriage, Warren's made decisions, during a very serious mid-life crisis, which have broken up their family.'

Warren's stepmother, the U.S. television star Lisa Vanderpump, previously admitted that the 16-year age gap between the couple initially worried her and his father, Ken Todd.  

Lisa said: 'When Warren first met Sue, the age difference, the secrecy that had transpired, was not something we supported.

'But I learned a very valuable lesson — when our children make a choice, remember our opinions and influence are pretty much redundant.'

She added that, after a few years, 'we would have to admit we were wrong'.
