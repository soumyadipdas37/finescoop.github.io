She is one day away from ringing in her 33rd birthday.

But Hilary Duff had someone else's birthday in mind as she attended a party in Studio City on Sunday afternoon.

The 32-year-old Disney Channel alum was joined by husband Matthew Koma, 33, their daughter Banks Violet, one, and her son Luca Cruz, eight.

Hilary looked like the ultimate bohemian babe as she slipped her enviably fit frame into a patterned, burgundy toned maxi dress.

With a v-neckline and a cinched waist, the dress proved to be majorly figure flattering on Duff.

She slipped her feet into a pair of platform booties that came in a stunning cherry shade and featured stylish hardware around the ankles.

The Lizzie McGuire star styled her golden hair into a low bun and she placed a pair of sparkling gold hoops in her ears.

Hilary had a gorgeous leather Fendi bag slung over her shoulder and she held onto Banks' hand as she and her family made their way from their car to the party.

Banks looked sweet in a black and white gingham print dress and a pair of maroon Converse All Star sneakers.

Luca, whom Hilary shares with ex husband Mike Comrie, rocked a yellow striped shirt, some grey shorts, and a pair of trainers.

The entire family, besides baby Banks, wore masks during the socially-distanced birthday celebration.

Matthew had on a bright yellow beanie, a plaid shirt, and a pair of form fitting leggings.

After making their rounds and mingling with party guests, Hilary exited the gathering with a fussy Banks in her arms.

Matthew and Hilary wed in December of last year during an intimate ceremony held at Duff's home. They welcomed their first and only child, daughter Banks, in 2018. 

Last week, Koma uploaded a stunning snapshot of his wife to Instagram that showed her enjoying a bubble bath.

Hilary then took to her own Instagram page to show off a beautiful fall-themed bouquet she received from Matthew in anticipation of her 33rd birthday. 

'Bday flowers from my dream guy,' wrote the Cinderella Story actress, who also gave her fans a peek at the sweet note Matthew included with the stunning floral arrangement.  

'Happy Birthday week,' the note began. 'An unforgettable one for so many reasons. I can't wait to celebrate with you all week and eat the yummiest meals. I love you most.'
