Food Network star Katie Lee welcomed her baby girl on Wednesday.

And the next day the 38-year-old cookbook author shared the happy news as she posted a photo to Instagram with her daughter from her hospital bed.

'Welcome, baby Iris Marion Biegel 9.2.20. Our hearts are so full,' said the wife of television producer Ryan Biegel.

The brunette beauty has been documenting her pregnancy on social media with her last post of her baby bump shared on Tuesday: 'Pink skies at night.'

On August 23 she looked heavily pregnant in a colorful dress as she joked: 'Only wearing muumuus for the foreseeable future.'

Katie and Ryan announced they were expecting their first child in February. 'Eating for two. Baby Biegel is on the way,' wrote Lee, who was pictured baring her baby bump while enjoying a plate of home cooked pasta.

In April she revealed she was having a girl.

'Our original plan was to wait and be surprised at birth, but we decided at a time like this, some good news for us to be excited about right now outweighed a surprise in September,' explained Lee, in a post shared to her Instagram.

Previously, Lee opened about her fertility challenges after trying to conceive with Biegel since their September 2018 wedding.

'I am so beyond appreciative to all of you who have sent me kind messages and well wishes both since I got pregnant and since I shared with you about my fertility struggles last year,' she wrote in April on social media.

In 2019, she spoke candidly about undergoing IVF treatment and how the 'intense process' had, unfortunately, resulted in 'zero healthy embryos.'

'They say it takes a village to raise a child, but for some of us, it takes a village to have a child,' she noted.

The ex-wife of Billy Joel - they were wed from 2004 until 2010 - talked often of her pregnancy.

In May she spoke candidly about her experience on TODAY with Hoda & Jenna.

'I've never felt better about my body than right now, and I just love being pregnant,' said the celebrity chef. 

'We're so excited,' Lee said of the anticipation felt by her and husband Ryan.

'And, you know, I feel like the best thing about being home during this time is that I don't ever have to put on tight clothes!'

'I get to just keep growing and wearing sweatpants!' said the West Virginia native.

'It's a strange time - and obviously there's a lot of anxiety about everything going on in the world - but I'm just trying to have every moment of joy that I can.'
