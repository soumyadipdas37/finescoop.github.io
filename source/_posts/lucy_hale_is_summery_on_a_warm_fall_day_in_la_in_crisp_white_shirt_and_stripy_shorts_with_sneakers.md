She clearly loves her designer accessories.

And on Wednesday, Lucy Hale made sure her Balmain purse and Dior sneakers did not go unnoticed as she ran some errands in Los Angeles.

Not seen on the outing was the star's beloved Maltipoo Elvis.

This past Monday, she had gushed over her pup in an Instagram post.

Posing with the dog in her lap, she shared a selfie video to her Instagram Story with the legend: 'The nose kills me.'

In the images, the Pretty Little liars alum gazes directly into the camera as she rests her head in one hand and smiles sweetly while holding the white fluffy dog in her lap. 

In a separate snap, the pooch is seen posing with a large bone name plate as he sits on an arm chair.

Hale is so devoted to Elvis - or Elvy as she likes to call him - that she got his name inked in cursive on her arm earlier this summer.

Back in May, the actress told Elle that she believes she and Elvis, whom she adopted in 2016, knew each other in a previous life. 

'I totally believe in reincarnation and I know for a fact that I have known Elvis in a life before because we are just entirely too connected,' she said in the 'Ask Me Anything' video for Elle.
