Since launching in September 2016, OnlyFans has reportedly paid out more than $1 billion to creators, according to the company. The service currently boasts over 50 million registered users and 700,000 content creators. 

Pia found fame as a singer, appearing on will.i.am‘s hit Boys & Girls and recently releasing the single, Hot.

Pia previously sat down for a candid interview with Daily Mail Australia about how she deals with online trolls.

She explained: 'I've never really been one on social media to take things to heart. I'm on there just to share life and be positive and happy. I don't let things affect me. I do what I want and I do what makes me happy.'

Pia elaborated by claiming she isn't worried about her body image and she doesn't diet or deny herself anything she wants, whether it's Cheetos or green juice.

She confessed: 'I don't diet. I do what I want and I do what makes me happy. I exercise, but if I want to buy an entire bag of Cheetos, I'm going to, and if I want a green juice, I'll do that too. I don't like restrictions, it's not the way to live.'
