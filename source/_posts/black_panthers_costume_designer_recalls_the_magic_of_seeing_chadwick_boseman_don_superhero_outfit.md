Black Panther's costume designer Ruth Carter recalled the 'magic' of seeing the late Chadwick Boseman don the superhero outfit for first time.

'When he put on the suit and the helmet went on, it was like magic,' the Oscar-winning designer, 60, told People Monday of the late actor, who died at 43 from colon cancer in August.

Carter told the outlet that she had previously developed professional chemistry working with Boseman on 2017's Marshall, in which the actor played Thurgood Marshall, who was the first Black Supreme Court Justice.

'I went through the fitting process with Chad - he had a lot of changes,' she said. 'Thurgood Marshall was very dapper in his young days, so we dressed him really dapper. He was a lot of fun. But I understood from our fitting that he really did want to come together on this and understand the period, understand what his role was.'

Carter, who has also worked on films such as Selma, Dolemite Is My Name and the upcoming Coming 2 America, reflected on the day that she fitted the actor for with the ensemble he would wear as King T’Challa in the 2018 blockbuster.

'I had the pants suit in my office and it was dressed on a mannequin, and I thought, this thing doesn't look all that great, partly because the mannequin was weird,' Carter said. 'I called Chadwick in and I asked him to put the suit on - we needed to see if there were any problems or anything - and when he put on the suit and the helmet went on, it was like magic.

'I could see the power of these superheroes. I could see how they have an effect on people just because it's like they are a superhero.'

Magical moment: Carter won her first Academy Award for in the category of Best Achievement in Costume Design in 2019 for Black Panther

She said that the working situation with the superstar actor was always simpatico: 'He always greeted me with a smile, a hug and cooperation.

'I think that relationship ... there was so much trust because we'd worked on Marshall together,' she told the outlet. 'There was so much trust when we started Black Panther. It was an incredible experience because he didn't doubt anything.'

She said Boseman was happy and supportive of her when she was hired to work on Black Panther, for which she won her first Academy Award for in the category of Best Achievement in Costume Design. She had previously been nominated for Best Costume Design for her work on the 1997 film Amistad and 1992's Malcolm X.

Fond memories: Carter reflected on the day that she fitted the actor for with the ensemble he would wear as King T’Challa in the 2018 blockbuster. She was snapped in LA earlier this year 

Tragic: The actor, also known for his work in movies like 42, Marshall, Get on Up and Draft Day, was diagnosed with stage three cancer in 2016 and died this past August 

'I wanted to just keep it quiet and then, towards the end of the shooting, I finally revealed my secret,' she said of her hiring on the hit movie. 'And Chad said, "I already knew." He said, "You killed it Ruth, you killed it."'

The actor, also known for his work in movies like 42, Marshall, Get on Up and Draft Day, was diagnosed with stage three cancer in 2016.

He underwent 'countless surgeries and chemotherapy' in his battle with the disease,' his family said in a statement after his death. 'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much. It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Panther.'
