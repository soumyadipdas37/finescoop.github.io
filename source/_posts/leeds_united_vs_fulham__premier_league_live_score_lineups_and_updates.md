Leeds United take on fellow Premier League promoted side Fulham at Elland Road this afternoon as both teams search for their their first win of the season.Â 

Marcelo Bielsa's side are looking to bounce back from last week's thrilling 4-3 defeat to Liverpool last week on the opening day and the iconic Chilean boss has made one change to his side with captain Liam Cooper replacingÂ Pascal Struijk in defence.

Fulham welcome back Aleksandar Mitrovic to their Premier League starting line-up after scoring in the Carabao Cup win over Ipswich Town this week. The Serbian started on the bench for the Cottagers' disappointing 3-0 loss to Arsenal last weekend, while there are also top-flight debuts for Alphonse Areola and Kenny Tete.
