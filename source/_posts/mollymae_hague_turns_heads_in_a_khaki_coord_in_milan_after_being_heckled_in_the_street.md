The media personality was quizzed by fans about her plans to have a baby during an Instagram Q&A, where she told her followers she has always seen herself as a young mum.

When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae, who has been dating Tommy for one year, said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.'  

The blonde also answered the question: 'If you could meet Tommy again without the fame, would you?' 

She replied: 'Well this is the nice thing about how we met, we met on Love Island and I didn't know who he was, he didn't know who I was. It was a really natural and nice way of meeting.'
