Autumn can be a glorious time, but it's frustrating when wind-blown leaves and debris make a mess of your garden. 

If you're looking to tidy your garden in record time and with minimal fuss, then why not go for a three-in-one machine that collects, vacuums and mulches garden debris?

Enter the bestselling VonHaus 3 in 1 Leaf Blower. With over 3,000 ratings, it's many people's go-to for clearing wet and dry leaves and stubborn debris. Plus, at only £39.99 it's exceptionally affordable. 

The VonHaus 3-in-1 Leaf Blower makes light work of clearing your garden in the autumn 

If you're fed up with the seasonal challenge of sweeping away leaves, twigs and general garden debris from your garden or patio, then investing in a high-quality leaf blower doesn't have to be as expensive as you might think. 

At less than £40, the VonHaus 3 in 1 Leaf Blower is an affordable and impressive machine. Ideal for tidying lawns, patios, driveways and more, the powerful 3000W motor blows, vacuums and mulches leaves into material suitable for composting. 

Leaf blowers can easily fetch up to £400, but if you've got a smaller garden or are not looking to part with too much money for a seasonal buy, the VonHaus 3 in 1 Leaf Blower is a great choice. 

As an electric motor, it's naturally cheaper and lighter than gas models. It's not cordless, but shoppers have found that isn't a problem as there's a ten meter cable. If you have an extra long garden then it might be worth looking in to a battery-operated leaf blower. 

Along with the traditional leaf blowing function, the blower also has a vacuuming and mulching mode so you really get the most for your money.  

One Amazon reviewer wrote: 'I have to give this 5 stars based on value and quality. I've no previous experience of leaf blowers but for the money I think you'd struggle to beat this.' 

They added: 'In use it does a great job. Easily shifted leaves and clumps of moss. It is fairly light so I didn't bother with the strap but there is one if needed. The power cable is nice and long.'

Weighing just 3.5kg, the VonHaus 3 in 1 Leaf Blower a light and powerful option which should make light work of tidying up your garden

Another shopper wrote: 'I must admit for the price I wasn't expecting much, but this baby sucked up some huge piles of very wet leaves with no problem, took two screws to assemble and mulched it all down to next to nothing. Very impressed and would highly recommend to anyone looking to pick one of these up.' 

It's worth noting that some shoppers have warned against sucking up up too many wet leaves as the vacuum can clog. 

'Blow me down a great machine,' one shopper wrote. 'Light to use good blowing power and suction too, found that with a large pile of leaves a quick blow first to loosen it up and then switch to suction worked a treat. 

'Careful if the leaves are really wet that you don't try to ' bite off ore than it can chew' or it will block, common sense really.' 

In addition, the VonHaus 3 in 1 Leaf Blower also includes a shoulder strap and wheels, allowing you to work in comfort for prolonged periods.
