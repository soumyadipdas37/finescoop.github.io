Sergio Aguero was forced to ban wantaway Barcelona star Lionel Messi's name from being mentioned in his gaming session on Twitch.

The Manchester City striker is close friends with his Argentina team-mate, who shocked the world of football last week by informing Barcelona he wants to leave this summer.

The 33-year-old was dealt a blow by LaLiga on Sunday after he was told he cannot leave the Catalan giants on a free transfer, but reports remain rife of an impending move to Pep Guardiola's City.

That move would see Messi link up with Aguero at club level too, and fans were desperate to put the question to the four-time Premier League winner.

But after logging into Twitch for a live stream, Aguero refused to mention his international team-mate's name, while also deciding to mute the words 'Messi', 'Leo' and 'GOAT' from the live video.

Aguero has more than two million followers on Twitch after setting up his own channel.

But this time when he logged in he just wanted to play the video game Fall Guys rather than discuss the story that has rocked the football world.

It is not the first time that Messi's name has been involved in one of Aguero's Twitch sessions.

Back in July, Aguero was recovering at home after having knee surgery and was on Twitch when he should have been seeing a physio.

But the 33-year-old received a blow when he was informed that he could not leave on a free

Messi knew this and messaged Aguero to 'stop messing around' in an amazing telling off, with the striker reading the text out live on air.

The Barcelona star's transfer away from the club is no laughing matter however, with the 33-year-old believing a clause in his contract states he can leave on a free transfer at the end of each season should he want to, one which Barcelona claim expired on June 10.

And LaLiga have sided with Barcelona's version of events, which boosts the Catalans chances of keeping hold of their talisman this summer.

It means City will need to pay the £630million release clause to sign the Argentinian star this summer, or strike a transfer agreement with Barcelona in the market.

This could impact the deal as Messi's overall transfer package will now be larger, given his large wages and image rights payments. 

Messi is understood to earn £63million-a-year which includes basic salary and image rights fees. However, performance-related bonuses and other sponsorship agreements could take that number to around £94million-a-year.
