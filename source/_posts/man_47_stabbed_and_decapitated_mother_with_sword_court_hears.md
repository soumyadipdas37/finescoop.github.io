A negligee wearing son stabbed his 86-year-old mother with an ornamental sword before decapitating her and put her head in the freezer, a court has heard.

Philip Tarver, 47, is alleged to have murdered Angela Tarver at the £600,000 family home in Woking, Surrey, in December last year. 

He is then said to have turned on his father Colin Tarver, 83, threatening to kill him during an argument in the kitchen, the court heard.

But the heroic father managed to wrestle the weapon away from his son and call the police, jurors were told.

By the time police arrived at the scene, Mrs Tarver's severed head had been placed in the freezer and her left ring finger sliced off and put in the kettle by her son, the court heard.  

Opening the murder trial at the Old Bailey, Alexandra Healy QC said: 'It is the prosecution case that at around midday that day, in the kitchen of the address, the defendant stabbed his mother in the chest with an ornamental sword, killing her.

'Brandishing that sword in the dining room of the property he argued with and threatened to kill his father.' 

Ms Healy said: 'It appears that, whilst the police were making their way to the address, the defendant decapitated his mother, placing her head into the freezer in the kitchen.

'And he amputated her left ring finger, which he placed into a kettle.'

Tarver began to clean up, washing himself and the knife he used to decapitate his mother, it was claimed.

When police arrived, he came to the front door 'waving a Union Jack and saying he surrendered', Ms Healy said.

Following his arrest, Tarver heard his father was being spoken to by police and allegedly commented: 'Oh, of course his wife. His wife is in the freezer.'

On arrival at the police station he said he was 'sorry for killing her' adding that he 'must repent my sins', the court heard.

Jurors were also told how Tarver had 'drunk a bottle of vodka and six beers the night before the killing,' and had walked downstairs wearing wearing a women’s nightdress and began to ‘spring clean’.  

Ms Healy added: ‘The defendant came downstairs wearing a female nightie or negligee and while he normally wore male clothing he did sometimes wear female clothes.’

During the morning his son began to unplug wires and claim his beer last night had been poisoned.

After preparing a breakfast of poached eggs, the father heard his wife screaming.

‘He heard a short, sharp scream, and ran from where he was into the dining room,’ Ms Healy added.

She said: 'Suddenly, the defendant appeared in front of him holding an ornamental sword.

‘He was holding the sword out in front of him, pointing it towards Colin Tarver.

‘He said something to the effect of: “I am going to kill you” or “I have to kill you”.

‘He had a demented look in his eyes which he said were bulging.’

During a mental health assessment, Tarver went on to explain how he killed his mother, jurors were told.

He was taken to a mental health hospital where he remained until March when he was deemed fit to be interviewed by police.

Tarver denies murdering his mother and making a threat to kill his father.
