In the film, a small-town police station becomes the unlikely battleground between a professional hitman (Gerard), a smart rookie female cop, and a double-crossing con man (Frank) who seeks refuge behind bars with no place left to run.

The role of the female lead is still pending. Principal photography has been slated to begin in October with shoots in Georgia and New Mexico.

The premiere of Gerard's latest movie Greenland, which has been delayed two times since June due to the coronavirus crisis, is now slated to be released in the US September 25.

The apocalyptic family drama film, directed by Ric Roman Waugh of Angel Has Fallen fame, has already premiered in Belgium, France and Scandinavia.

Greenland, which also stars Morena Baccarin and Scott Glenn, tells the story of a disintegrating comet that begins falling to earth and leveling cities, resulting in chaos and madness throughout the world.

Butler and and his ex Morgan Brown, a real estate developer and designer, parted ways after dating for more than six years, according to PEOPLE in late August.

They were last snapped publicly sharing a kiss on Venice Beach in early August.
