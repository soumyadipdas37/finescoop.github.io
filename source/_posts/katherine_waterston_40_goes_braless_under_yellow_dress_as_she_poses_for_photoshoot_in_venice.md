She was seen putting on a stylish display as she stepped out for the premiere of her movie, The World To Come, at the 77th Venice Film Festival on Sunday.

And Katherine Waterston turned heads once again on Monday, whens she was seen putting on a risqué display as she posed on a Venice beach for a photoshoot.

The 40-year-old actress went braless under a lemon yellow dress which boasted a large cutout feature stretching from the sides of her torso to her entire back.

Her gown of choice also featured a high neckline and broad collar, while the full-length flowing skirt included a knee-high slit.

With her chestnut brown tresses falling beyond her shoulders in bold waves, the screen star highlighted her good looks with a light palette of makeup. 

A day earlier, the UK-born, US-raised actress put on a glamorous display as she joined her co-star Vanessa Kirby for the premiere of their film The World To Come.

With the crew: Crew members were seen accompanying the star to the picturesque location

She caught the eye in a fringed black dress, which highlighted her sensational figure and included daring thigh-high slits.

Her appearance at the corresponding photocall earlier contrasted her evening wear, as she stepped out in an all-white ensemble. 

The Fantastic Beasts And Where to Find Them star teamed a subtly pleated A-line skirt with a zip-up collared shirt. 

She wore her raven locks in an understated half-up, half-down 'do and shielded her mouth and nose with a stark white face mask.

Katherine and Vanessa were joined by Norwegian director Mona Fastvold, American producer Christine Vachon and actor Christopher Abbott, 34, for a group shot.

Upcoming film: Katherine is at the festival to promote her upcoming movie The World To Come

Causing a stir: Back in 2018, Katherine caused a stir when she revealed her pregnancy at the London premiere of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald

No public announcements: It is also not publicly known when she gave birth to her child, whose gender and name have also been kept under wraps

The World To Come is set on the American East Coast in the mid-19th century, where two neighboring couples battle hardship and isolation, and is based upon Jim Shepard's novel of the same name.

Back in 2018, Katherine caused a stir when she revealed her pregnancy at the London premiere of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

In lieu of making a verbal announcement, she cradled her baby bump as she posed for pictures on the star-studded red carpet.

The actress, who was previously in a six-year relationship with American playwright and director Adam Rapp, never publicly revealed the identity of the child's father.

It is also not publicly known when she gave birth to her child, whose gender and name have also been kept under wraps. 

Catching the eye: The night before, Katherine, 40, turned heads in a fringed black dress, which highlighted her sensational figure, as she attended the premiere of The World To Come
