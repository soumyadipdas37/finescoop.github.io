Students at one of Sydney's most elite private schools encouraged their peers to spit on a homeless man, get arrested and take two laxatives while eating spicy curry as part of an elaborate 'muck-up day' scavenger hunt.

Shore School, on the city's lower north shore, has threatened to expel any Year 12 students who take part in the 'Triwizard Shorenament' - a reference to Harry Potter. 

The 'official rule and challenge book' - created by students in a PDF document - revealed they planned to meet between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday at Waverton Park for the series of 'treacherous' challenges.

The school leavers would then be split into teams of five or six before carrying out a series of tasks to compete for points.

The rule book states all participants from the $33,000-a-year school are required to chip in $10 and the team who gathers the most points would be rewarded the total cash prize.

'What happens on the night stays within the night. No evidence is to be shared outside of the Year 12 2020 Shore community.'

Instructions written into the rule book advise students they must document their completed tasks on an Instagram account created specifically for their team. 

The scavenger hunt is limited to Sydney's CBD and the city's lower north shore.

The exclusive bubble stretches from Belmore Park, out the front of Central Station, to the Spit Bridge and includes Kirribilli, Neutral Bay and Mosman.

Students are encouraged to bring Vaseline, a towel, 'lots of alcohol', a spare set of clothing, a 'solid' amount of money, a topped up Opal card and a portable speaker.

The Muck-Up Day manifesto was discovered by school administrators, who contacted NSW Police.   

Shore School Headmaster Dr Timothy Petterson condemned the muck-up day challenges and said the list was not reflective of the wider Year 12 group.

John Gorton - Australia's 19th prime minister

Frank Packer - media goliath and Packer family patriarch 

Dyson Heydon - High Court judge

Errol Flynn - Hollywood legend

John Newcombe - tennis superstar

Phil Waugh - Australian rugby great 

'Shore unequivocally condemns the activities detailed in the proposed scavenger hunt document that has circulated in recent days,' he said in a statement.

'The document appears to be the work of a small number of boys who are not representative of our wider Year 12 group.'

The headmaster said the activities are 'unlawful, harmful and disrespectful of the public and have appalled our school community'. 

'The activities do not reflect Shore's values or what the school stands for,' he said.

'Shore has already communicated to parents in the strongest possible terms that boys are not to take part in the activities.'

Dr Petterson said any boy who participates in the scavenger hunt risks losing their place at Shore.  

A spokesperson for NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia they respect the age old tradition of muck-up day but will not tolerate any illegal behaviour.

Established in 1889, Shore School features state-of-the art facilities and an incredible view over Sydney Harbour.

Shore is regularly ranked among the top schools in NSW for its Year 12 results and has produced a prime minister, a High Court Judge and several sporting champions.

'We place a strong emphasis on character formation, challenging our students to be responsible citizens of integrity who seek to serve the wider community,' the Shore School website states.

'We believe the best evidence of success will be exhibited in the adult lives of those who have passed through the School.

'We are proud of our many Old Boys who have served in all walks of life with great dedication.'

Former Students include Australia's 19th prime minister John Gorton, High Court of Australia judge Dyson Heydon, tennis champion John Newcombe, media tycoon Frank Packer and Hollywood legend Errol Flynn.

Students at the elite Shore School have mocked battling western Sydney suburbs as being full of 'druggos' in a viral video - after they were caught planning vile Muck Up day antics and boasting about their exclusive facilities. 

The TikTok video shows students from the $33,000-a-year school on Sydney's north shore being interviewed by popular account Fonzie Gomez, who asks the boys in their trademark boater hats and uniforms to to name the 'worst' suburbs in Sydney. 

All but one student names Blacktown or Mount Druitt in Sydney's west as they prepare to board the train at North Sydney station.

Students at the $33,000-a-year Shore School have slammed other suburbs for being full of 'druggos' in a viral TikTok video (pictured), in the latest scandal to rock the elite college

The latest video comes after students were slammed for bragging about their lavish facilities, including a '$50 mill[ion] gym' and library with Sydney Harbour views in an earlier TikTok clip that was part of a global viral trend of comparing school facilities. 

Then on Tuesday, a document circulating among Year 12 students detailing their plans for muck-up day was leaked to the public. 

The 'pranks' included spitting on homeless men, assaulting strangers, taking drugs and breaking into Taronga Zoo.  

In the now deleted TikTok interview, a group of four Shore School students were told to name the worst suburb in Sydney. 

'Blacktown,' the four boys answer in unison.

When asked to elaborate one said 'because its Blacktown', before another answered 'druggos'.

Another pair of mates were asked the same question, with one replying: 'The worst is Bankstown... too many 'eshays' who'll roll you'.

An eshay refers to a Sydney subculture of young criminals who tend to wear bumbags and sneakers, and are usually considered to be from battler suburbs.

The exception among the group was one boy who said the worst suburb 'is Mosman because all the rich kids live there'.
