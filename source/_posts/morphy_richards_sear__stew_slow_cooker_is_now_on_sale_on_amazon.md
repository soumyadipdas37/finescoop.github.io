We can't help but crave warm hearty dinners in autumn and with casserole season fast approaching, now is a great time to invest in a slow cooker. 

A slow cooker is celebrated by homemakers thanks to the simple fact you can just throw everything in and in a few hours your meal is ready with minimum effort.

If you want to master your stews and curries, then the Morphy Richards 460018 Sear & Stew Slow Cooker is a great device. In fact it's currently the number one bestseller in the 'Slow Cookers' department on Amazon. 

The Morphy Richards 460018 Sear & Stew Slow Cooker is the number one bestselling slow cooker on Amazon- and it could be yours for only £27.99

Even better, the highly-rated cooker is now reduced to £27.99 - that's a decent saving of 15 per cent. 

With more than 3,000 ratings and a near-perfect average score of 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon, the Morphy Richards 460018 Sear & Stew is an incredibly popular choice with foodies and amateur cooks alike. 

The slow cooker has received impressive reviews across the board with shoppers calling it 'very easy to use', 'lovely and light' and 'excellent results'. Super nifty, this 3.5 litre slow cooker will allow you to create delicious dinners for a family of four with minimal prep. 

The Morphy Richards Slow Cooker takes out the need for spending hours in the kitchen. Just chuck in your chosen ingredients and then set your cooking temperature; Low (6-12 hours), Medium (4-10 hours) or High (3-8 hours).

Cooking the food steadily over a longer period of time will lock in the moisture, ensuring your meat or vegetables are cooked perfectly. From chunky soups to curries, casseroles and stews, this is a great kitchen gadget which really comes in to its own in the autumn and winter months. 

What's more, this slow cooker even features an inner cooking pot which can be used on the hob to seal in flavour before setting the slow cook function.

One shopper wrote: 'Love that you can sear meat first, it gives the food that extra flavour and all juices are kept in place unlike using a separate pan and transferring. Very light and easy to use and clean. Can fit a whole small/medium chicken in.'

Simple and easy to use, you can cook delicious dinners without spending hours in the kitchen. It heats evenly so you won’t even have to check and stir your ingredients

One of the biggest positives of the Morphy Richards Slow Cooker is the fact that it's so easy to use. Even when you're finished with the cooker, it's so lightweight you can just put it in the dishwasher- minimal mess and minimal fuss.

A second customer commented: 'The best cooking appliance I have ever bought. It is just so easy to use and very easy to clean. If you don't have time or you don't want to stand in the kitchen on weekends (like me) but still want to provide a delicious meal... This slow cooker is great! Not only for dinner but also desserts.'

Another added: 'Best bit of kitchen kit I've bought in a while. I have a slow crock pot, 25 years old, and it's heavy and you have to use another pan to sear meat and veg...double washing up. Not any more....sear in the liner on the hob and then into the slow cooker unit and it weighs nothing. Timing is perfect especially for overnight cooking which costs about tuppence. Love it!'

A fourth raved: 'I used to hate cooking before I got this! To be honest it's amazing, so easy to use and clean afterwards, my husband is even complimenting me on my food which trust me is a first in many years of marriage. I haven't produced one bad offering from this wonder pot and my husband is really happy to not be eating processed burnt food covered in charcoal anymore.'
