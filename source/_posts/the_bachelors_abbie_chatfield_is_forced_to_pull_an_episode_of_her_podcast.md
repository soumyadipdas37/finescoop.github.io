Abbie Chatfield has been forced to pull an episode from her tell-all podcast, after a former boyfriend withdrew his consent for her to discuss their relationship.

On Tuesday, the 25-year-old claimed her ex 'won't let' her post the hour-long installment of her podcast It's A Lot, which would have included deeply personal details of their relationship and break-up.

The episode was set to be the second part of a two-part special. The first, which remains available online, saw Abbie discuss her ex using the pseudonym 'Barry', and claim that she was ghosted, controlled and 'gaslighted' during their relationship.

Upset: Former Bachelor star Abbie Chatfield (pictured) revealed on Tuesday that she had been forced to pull an episode from her tell-all podcast, after an ex-boyfriend withdrew his consent for her to publicly discuss their relationship

'This week, I was supposed to have out the second half of "The Ex-boyfriend That I Love" episode,' the Bachelor star said in a brief update on her podcast channel.

'Unfortunately, despite giving me prior consent and despite giving me ongoing consent to leave up part one, he and I spent all of the better half of this week on the phone, talking about how he doesn't want to the second part up.

'Bit annoyed. Wish I'd have uploaded it all in one go. It was a lot of work, as well, which I was upset about.'

In the first episode, Abbie had claimed that she and her ex had broken up and got back together about '17 times' over a two-year period.

Abbie was in a constant spiral of heartache during their tumultuous romance, but claims her ex did apologise to her after listening to the first episode.

Devastated: Abbie said she was upset by the decision, after fans had told her the first episode in her planned two-part series had 'helped' them process their own traumatic break-ups

She added that the first episode had triggered many responses from fans saying it had 'helped' them process their own traumatic break-ups.

Abbie continued: 'But, I worry about him - unfortunately, first and foremost. I think it was confronting for him to hear what he actually did.

'I got the most sincere apology that I'd gotten over the years. So that was good. But unfortunately, I can't release part two because he won't let me. So, I'm not going to.'

She added: 'I'm just feeling a bit sad about it. I felt like it was my chance to have a cathartic moment about it. 

'Unfortunately some people in Brisbane are more interested in their reputation than they are about the truth.'

Furious: When a fan on Instagram Stories said the episode 'was supposed to be a cathartic experience' for Abbie and her ex had taken that away from her, Abbie responded: 'I wish I could release it without a defamation suit'. She later said that while the claims in her podcast were true, she couldn't prove them in court

Abbie later took to her Instagram Stories to respond to fan messages surrounding the missing podcast.

One fan wrote that the episode 'was supposed to be a cathartic experience' for Abbie, and said the podcast 'was meant to be for you and reclaiming your power'.

Abbie swiftly responded: 'I wish I could release it without a defamation suit lol.'

When another fan pointed out that defamation requires that the information is false, Abbie responded: 'But I must prove that it's true. And I don't have material evidence that will hold up in court.'

'Can't exactly prove it': Abbie later shared a post saying she 'couldn't prove' a specific claim relating to a deeply personal matter, which would mean her ex could sue her for defamation
