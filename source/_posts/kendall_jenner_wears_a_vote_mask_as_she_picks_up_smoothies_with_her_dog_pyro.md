She did her first ever Instagram Live session the day before to encourage her followers to register to vote.

And Kendall Jenner kept her message consistent as she stepped out in Malibu on Wednesday with a black mask reading, 'VOTE.'

The 24-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star made the political statement while stopping to pick up some purple smoothies.

Kendall showed off her enviable figure with her olive crop top, which featured large tortoiseshell buttons and mid-length sleeves.

She flaunted her toned midriff above her high-waisted black figure-hugging shorts, which also highlighted her long legs.

The 5ft10in beauty completed her ensemble with a set of black sandals, and she wore a simple black handbag slung under her shoulder.

She added a set of slim black sunglasses to block out the bright light and had her dark tresses parted down the middle and tide back with a hair clip.

Joining Kendall on her smoothie run was her gorgeous Doberman Pinscher Pyro.

The catwalk star first introduced the pooch back in May 2018, and the two have been quarantining with each other throughout the pandemic.

In June, she shared some dramatic photos of Pyro and joked in the caption that she was 'raising a model.'

Her large, sleek canine is a departure from the small, fluffy Pomeranians that her older sisters have favored for their children.

Doing her part: On Monday, Kendall showed how politically engaged she was by making her debut Instagram Live video

On Monday, Kendall showed how politically engaged she was by making her debut Instagram Live video.

She had a conversation with Jon Favreau, former speech writer for President Barack Obama and current host of the popular politics podcast Pod Save America.

The reality star had some initial technical difficulties since she wasn't used to the format, but once things got underway the two discussed the perils of voter suppression across the country and the importance of increasing youth voting turnout.

'If you don't like what's happening in America right now, I honestly think this election is your last chance to change it,' Favreau warned.

'Voting won't elect a savior, it won't solve all our problems, but voting will give us a chance to do something about climate change, systemic racism, healthcare, and education. Voting will give us a chance to make sure that our politics isn't as f**ked up as it is right now, and that we're not all at each other's throats like we are right now.'

Kendall's turn toward social engagement comes as her long-running series Keeping Up With The Kardashians is set to end.

Earlier this month, the Kardashian–Jenner family announced that the show would finish with its 20th season in 2021.

That still leaves fans with time to watch the current 19th season, and Kendall and her family are currently at work filming the final season.

The move to end the series came from Kris Jenner and was sparked by Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's desire to end their participation, according to Page Six. 

Saying goodbye: Her outing came after the Kardashian–Jenner clan decided to end Keeping Up With The Kardashians, reportedly because Kim and Kylie wanted out
