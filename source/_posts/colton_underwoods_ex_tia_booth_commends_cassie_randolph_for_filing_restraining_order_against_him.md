Cassie Randolph filed for and was granted a temporary restraining order against ex Colton Underwood, earlier this month. 

Bachelor Nation's Tia Booth, who dated Underwood before he appeared on the Bachelorette and again on Bachelor in Paradise, spoke out on the situation between him and Randolph. 

Speaking to Us Weekly on Friday, Booth said she 'commends' Randolph for filing and that she wishes them both 'the best.'

'I commend her for being able to speak up and do what she feels like she needs to do to be safe,' Booth said of Randolph, 25. 'But I am thinking about both of them, and I hope they can both kind of be in a good place.' 

She added that she wishes 'the best for both of them.' 

While she acknowledged that the situation has multiple sides and is private she praised people for being able to stand up for their safety. 

'That’s something that should be private between them because you just never know both sides of the story,' the 29-year-old said.

Adding: 'But I would like to say, for Cassie or anyone, if anyone ever feels like they are in danger or ever feels like they need to do something to protect themselves, I completely commend them for doing that.'

After Randolph's filing Underwood, 28, was ordered to stay at least 100 yards away from her, her home, her work and must not contact her and avoid all threatening behavior. 

In her court filing Randolph attached photos of the tracking device she says Colton attached to the rear bumper of her car. She claims he admitted to attaching the device.  

There will be a hearing in October where Colton will be able to tell his side of the story, TMZ reported.

The former couple started their romance on Underwood's 23rd season of The Bachelor, which aired in early 2019. 

They announced their split in May of this year, though in her filing Randolph noted their split as occurring in April.  

As well as planting the tracking device, she claims Underwood urned up uninvited at her various residences among other allegations, according to TMZ.   

Randolph went on to allege that he takes 'obsessive walks' to her apartment and lingered outside of her bedroom window at her parent's beach house at 2 A.M., according to the outlet. 

Another odd turn: The former couple started their romance on Underwood's 23rd season of The Bachelor, which aired in early 2019. According to the filing, Colton 'used alias phone numbers to anonymously send harassing text messages at all hours of the day to Ms. Randolph and to her friends. Mr. Underwood also sent harassing text messages to himself pretending to also be a victim of the anonymous stalker… He later admitted to being the one sending the messages.' Seen in 2019

Along with physical behavior, Randolph also claimed that the former football player has been sending her harassing text messages accusing her of spending time with her ex-boyfriend, among other messages.  

The former football player has called her 'selfish' and 'shady' in several of the messages seen by E! News from documents pertaining to the order.

In the paperwork, Randolph also alleged that Underwood sent anonymous text messages to her and himself to say he was also the victim of a stalker, though she claims he later confessed to that as well.

Mr. Underwood also sent harassing text messages to himself pretending to also be a victim of the anonymous stalker… He later admitted to being the one sending the messages.' 

Split: The former lovebirds first sparked breakup rumors after he returned to his hometown in Colorado after recovering from coronavirus at her family's home in Huntington Beach, California  

When Randolph's ex-boyfriend made a visit to her home, Colton knew he would be there and 'obsessively called and sent text messages' causing her to feel watched. 

Days later he allegedly showed up to her residence and yelled at her: ‘I am going to keep you accountable.’ 

Since announcing their split earlier this year, Randolph and Underwood have had public dust ups about their relationship and break up. 

In July, Randolph accused her ex of trying to 'monetize' their split by writing about it in the upcoming second edition of his book without her prior approval and though they agreed to remain silent on the reasons of the split.   

Underwood has reportedly been at his family home in Colorado, after spending coronavirus lockdown with Randolph and her family before the split.
