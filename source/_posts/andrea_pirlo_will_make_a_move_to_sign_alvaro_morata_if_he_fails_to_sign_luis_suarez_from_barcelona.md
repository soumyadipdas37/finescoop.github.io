Juventus could turn back the clock as Andrea Pirlo is reportedly interested in bringing Alvaro Morata back to the club.

The new Juventus boss is very keen on signing a striker during the summer transfer window and has been heavily linked with Barcelona star Luis Suarez. 

 Mundo Deportivo are reporting that should Juventus fail in their pursuit of the Uruguayan however, they could turn their focus back to Morata.

A move for Morata would reunite Morata and Pirlo who played together in the 2014-15 season

Morata had a highly successful two-year spell at the Bianconeri after he joined from Real Madrid for £15.8m in 2014.

The 27-year-old has good memories from his time at the club, where he scored 27 goals in 93 appearances.

He helped Juventus to two Serie A titles and helped them to the Champions League final, where they fell to a 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in 2015. 

A move for Morata is not expected to be as simple or cheap than it would to sign Suarez

Should Juventus sign Morata, it would mean that Pirlo would reunite with the Spaniard who was part of the team during the Italian's final year as a player at the club. 

Morata's contract at Atletico Madrid runs until 2023, so a move for the striker is not expected to be as simple or cheap in comparison to Suarez.

Since leaving Juventus, Morata has had a second stint at Real Madrid as well as  a two-year spell at Chelsea.

At Atletico, the Spaniard has scored 22 goals in 61 appearances for the club.
