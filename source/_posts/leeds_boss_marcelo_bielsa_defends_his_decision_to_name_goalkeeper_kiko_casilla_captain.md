Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has defended his decision to hand Kiko Casilla the captain's armband following his ban for racial abuse.

The goalkeeper served an eight-match suspension last season after being found guilty of directing a racist remark towards Charlton forward Jonathan Leko, who later revealed the Spaniard has not apologised to him.

And some Leeds fans were unhappy when Bielsa named the 33-year-old as skipper for Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie at home to Hull, during which he scored in a penalty-shootout defeat.

Bielsa insisted his players thought Casilla 'deserves to be the captain', despite his ban for racial abuse last season

Bielsa said: 'His team-mates think he deserves to be the captain and we have to listen to those messages. The players see in their captain someone who they think can represent them.

'I respect the thoughts of any person. After that, opinions can be argued. Surely those who judge Kiko ignore a lot of things his team-mates see in him.

'Of course we also value the conduct of Kiko, which only we can judge because we are part of the group.

'When you are subject to what other people judge you for or think, it doesn't matter what we think, we have to accept the decision of the authorities.

'It is also important that you may not know what percentage of the fanbase actually didn't want Kiko as captain, because the opinion of the masses should always be heard.

'Surely the public won't have all the information that his team-mates will have.'







Fans vented their anger at the decision on social media, with one posting: 'Please, why is Kiko Casilla still at Leeds, how is being guilty of racism not violation of contract and a kick in the teeth to play him and captain him. 

'What does the new patch on the sleeve say? Seems like there's plenty of room for racism.'

Another wrote: 'The one thing that has been mismanaged at Leeds over the past 6-12 months is Kiko Casilla, regardless of evidence, once found guilty he should have been let go and certainly never captain a Leeds United side ever.' 

'Kiko Casilla should be nowhere near the pitch, let alone captain,' another added.

'I feel nothing but shame for the fact that he is here tonight,' while one more branded the decision 'disgusting'. 

Leeds host Fulham on Saturday and Bielsa has confirmed that £27million club-record signing Rodrigo will not start, but skipper Liam Cooper is set to return from injury having missed last weekend's 4-3 defeat at Liverpool.
