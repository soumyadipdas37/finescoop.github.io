He's currently experiencing a second wave of fame due to his season of Married At First Sight currently airing in the United Kingdom.

And on Wednesday, Nasser Sultan looked furious as she shouted down the phone during a lengthy call in Sydney.

The 52-year-old reality star gestured wildly during a break filming his vlog series, Drab or Fab!, and didn't seem bothered by other people around him.

At one point, Nasser was seen shaking his head and had his hands on his hips during the tense call.

Nasser was casually dressed in a grey long-sleeve sweater and an off-black pair of jeans. 

He finished his monochromatic ensemble with an oversized pair of sunglasses to shield him from prying eyes, and a simple pair of black sneakers with a white stripe.

While it's unclear if the show will be picked up by any Australian television networks, Nasser previously told Daily Mail Australia his show 'will air in Belgium, Italy and the UK'.

'It's raw and no scripted stuff,' Nasser explained.
