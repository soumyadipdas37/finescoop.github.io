Tarek El Moussa is living his best life.

The Flipping 101 star, 39, took to Instagram Sunday with an optimistic post about achieving life goals days after his ex-wife Christina, 37, said she was separating from English TV personality Ant Anstead, 41, after two years of marriage.

Tarek who shares daughter Taylor, nine, and and son Brayden, five, with Christina, was posted with his fiancée Heather Rae Young, 33, of Selling Sunset fame, looking cozy together on a couch in their upscale home in Newport Beach, California.

The latest: Tarek El Moussa, 39, took to Instagram Sunday with an optimistic post about achieving life goals days as he sat with his fiancée Heather Rae Young, 33. The post came days after his ex-wife Christina, 37, said she was separating from English TV personality Ant Anstead, 41, after two years of marriage

'I think we found the perfect couch for the new house today!!' he said. 'Okay...it may not seem exciting but to me it really is! We also found a ton of other stuff and I can’t wait to show you!'

He said he was 'just so excited about life,' listing a number of things that are going good for him right now: 'I’m in love, I’m engaged, flipping 101 is on the air and Flip or Flop is on the way.'

El Moussa told his 895,000-plus followers that the key to his success is perseverance and hard work: 'I’m telling you...it’s possible to accomplish those things you have been dreaming of!'

He continued: 'I dreamed of this life and I got it by believing I could do it and working my tail off!! If there is something you want just go for it! I’m yelling at you to chase your dreams!  It’s possible! If you really want it just go for it! One step at a time. Now... what have you been dreaming of? Tell me! Tell the world and go do it!'

Romance: Tarek and Young announced they were engaged this past July 

Happy together:  The couple looked snug in a recent post on Instagram 

El Moussa and Christina said they were separating in December 2016, and their divorce was finalized more than a year later in early 2018.

El Moussa and Young announced they were engaged this past July while vacationing on Catalina Island.

The couple initially bought their beach home in Orange County 'as a flip but then they decided to make it their new home,' the couple's rep told People. 'It’s their first project together! They have a lot they want to do with it and the house needs some work so they are going to continue to live in their current home until the new home is ready.'

Out and about: Christina was snapped late last year in Newport Beach, California 

Anstead, of Wheeler Dealers fame, and Christina first began seeing one another in October of 2017 and share son Hudson, one. 

'Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate,' Christina said on Friday. 'We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority. We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future.'

They exchanged vows at the home they shared in Newport Beach in December of 2018. Anstead is father to teen Amelie, 16, and Archie, 14, from this previous marriage to Louise Herbert.
