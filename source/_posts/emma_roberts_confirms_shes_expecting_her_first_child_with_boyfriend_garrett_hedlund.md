The niece of Julia Roberts was first linked to Garrett back in March 2019.

The two had been friends prior to dating, but a source described the relationship at the time as 'casual' and 'just a couple of weeks old' to Us Weekly.

Garrett, who was born and raised in rural Minnesota, is best known for starring in the Oscar-nominated Netflix film Mudbound, as well as the Netflix action–adventure film Triple Frontier, in which he starred with heavyweights including Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam and Pedro Pascal.

Prior to her new romance, Emma was in a seven-year on–off relationship with her AHS costar Evan Peters, 33. 

A source told UsWeekly at the time that it was not an amicable breakup and that they were now 'just friends.'

Garrett had previously been with Kirsten Dunst, 38, though they broke up in 2016 after more than four years together.

The actress has since moved on and gotten engaged to Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons, 32, with whom she shares a son. 

Us Weekly reported last month that Emma and Garrett new the sex of their baby, though they were keeping it private at the time.

The Little Italy actress initially tried to hide her bump while out in public, and her posting on social media has slowed to a trickle in recent months.
