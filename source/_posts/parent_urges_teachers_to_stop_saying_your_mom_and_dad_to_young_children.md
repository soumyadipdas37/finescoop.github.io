A a lesbian mother's post has gone viral on social media after she urged teachers to stop saying 'moms and dads' to young children. 

Associate Professor Sirry Alang, from Pennsylvania, took to Twitter to explain how families come in all different shapes and sizes and that not everyone has a mom or a dad - with some children having neither. 

In the post, she penned: 'Teachers, ur class convos are broadcasted in everyone's homes. The # of times the teacher has said 'your mom and dad' to my kid's class is infuriating.'

'But a BRAVE kid just said...'But I only told my grandma at lunch time because my sister and I live with our grandma'.

'Then of course my kid jumped in right away & said: 'I don't have a dad & it's ok because my mom said there are different kinds of families.

'Even though I would want a dad but she's gay. Gay means she only dates women.' LOL. Now my business is out there.'

She continued: 'But teacher apologized and said she'll start saying "parent or the adult helping you at home." I have faith in this generation.'

The post quickly garnered over 83, 000 likes and hundreds of comments from people praising her post.

'I say 'the adults who care for you,'' commented one, while a second penned: 'Your caregiver(s)' it's so easy to say, yet powerfully meaningful.'

Another suggested saying 'your supervisory figures,' while a further proposed 'your folks' as an alternative form of address. 

Meanwhile, others took to the comments section to express their gratitude of the Tweet.

'Thanks for sharing this. I so appreciate it,' praised one, while a second commented: 'SO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER KIDS HAVE A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS!'
