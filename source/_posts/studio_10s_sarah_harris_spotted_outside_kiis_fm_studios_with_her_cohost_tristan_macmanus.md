Tristan MacManus started his new role as co-host of Studio 10 alongside Sarah Harris last Monday.

And on Wednesday the pair looked happy and relaxed as they were spotted leaving the KIIS FM studios in North Ryde, Sydney. 

The television hosts had just made an appearance on The Kyle and Jackie O Show.

Sarah looked stunning, showing off her slender figure in a beige shift dress paired with black heels and a black leather bag. 

The 39-year-old completed the look with a pair of large earrings, but her best accessory was her beaming smile.  

She wore her cropped blonde locks loose and had a full face of makeup on,  including a smokey eye, bold brows and pink lipstick.   

Dressed to impress: Meanwhile, Tristan, 38, looked dashing in a navy suit he paired with a pale pink striped shirt and brown shoes

He completed the look with a patterned pocket square and appeared to be in good spirits, smiling at the camera.  

The Dancing with the Stars judge made his debut on Studio 10 last Monday, less than a week after former co-host Joe Hildebrand revealed he was leaving the show. 

Speaking on the radio program, Tristan admitted his job 'has been a bit difficult to get used to' because only recently he was working as a landscaper. 

'Now I have a suit on!'  Speaking on the radio program, Tristan admitted his job 'has been a bit difficult to get used to' because only recently he was working as a landscaper

Speaking on the radio program, Tristan admitted his job 'has been a bit difficult to get used to' because only recently he was working as a landscaper.

'It has been a bit difficult to get used to... I was labouring and now I have a suit on and I'm getting paid well,' he said. 

The husband of Australian actress Tahyna Tozzi explained that he'd turned to labouring in March after the coronavirus pandemic left him without work.

'I'd been breaking my a**e for the last couple months landscaping when my work got cancelled,' he said.
