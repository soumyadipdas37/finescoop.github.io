Jessica Simpson tried on a pair of skinny jeans from 14 years ago in July and was overjoyed when they slipped right on after losing 100lbs. 

Now the blonde beauty has reflected on the experience which she said thrilled her. 

'I was in complete shock,' said the other of three to People this week. 'It was a good 40th birthday present.'

Pleased: Jessica Simpson tried on a pair of skinny jeans from 14 years ago in July and was overjoyed when they slipped right on after losing 100lbs. Now the blonde beauty has reflected on the experience which she said thrilled her 

Happy lady: 'I was in complete shock,' said the other of three to People this week. 'It was a good 40th birthday present.' Seen in August on SiriusXM

In July she shared an image of herself to Instagram in the jeans looking proud. 

In the caption alongside the picture, Jessica wrote: 'I have kept these throwback True Religion jeans in my closet for 14 yrs (I’m not exaggerating!). I figured that since I’m in the final hours of my 30’s I’d give them another try, and hello 40, so nice to meet you.'  

Now, in September, Simpson is still marveling over the fit. 

The Dukes Of Hazzard actress added this week, 'I've tried to pull those things over my hips so many times. I just thought my hips, from having babies, would never go back, but the jeans went up.'

The past: In 2008 with Tony Romo leaving Nobu in Malibu after having dinner

More denim looks: Jessica went to Social nightclub with friends in 2006, left, and Simpson shops for shoes at the upscale French designer Christian Louboutin shop on Burton Way in Beverly Hills her dog in 2004, right

They were bedazzled, low waist True Religion skinny jeans with rips on the thigh. She was looking through her old clothes during quarantine when she found the pants. 

The seflie was taken in her bedroom. 

She also talked about the jeans on SiriusXM's The Jess Cagle Show in August.

'That was a really random thing, because I haven’t put jeans on through the whole time, I've been in sweats,' she noted.

'I just think I am such a person that reminisces, I hold on to so many memories, I am tragically romantic like that about my own self.'

The fashion designer also said, 'I freaked out two months before I turned 40, not knowing that that age would even mean anything to me but then its like 41, 42….

'I've never calculated my age until now…. I am accepting it slowly' she said with a laugh. 

Now she wears jeans all the time: Seen here in August in another pair of jeans; she has said she was once 240lbs but has lost 100lbs

She was 240lbs when she was at her heaviest; Jessica gained 100 pounds while pregnant with third child Birdie Mae, aged one. She also has Ace Knute, seven, and daughter Maxwell Drew, eight, with husband Eric Johnson.

'I was very open about being well over 200 pounds, on the heavy side of 200 pounds,' the singer said. 

'I’m open about my insecurities and my flaws, and if I can help inspire anybody to feel better about themselves, that’s why I’m here.'

Last month she reflected on the response to her memoir Open Book, published in January, in which she discusses quitting drinking three years ago.

'I did make a huge shift in my life…. I was at that point in my life where my kids were growing older and they were watching every move that I made. I just really wanted clarity. I wanted to understand myself cause I didn't even realize how much I was drinking and how much I was suppressing. 

Still going strong: The fashion designer has said she tries to look her best for husband Eric

'I thought it was making me brave, I thought it was making me confident and it was actually the complete opposite, it was silencing me…. It's almost been three years which is crazy, I mean it’s pretty, its awesome. 

The star proudly revealed that she has not been tempted to drink during the pandemic and it's been a huge help that husband Johnson, 40, stopped drinking too. 

'People are like "don’t you want to drink during this pandemic, oh my god aren't your kids driving you crazy." I'm like no, I do not want to drink like I have not wanted it, I feel like that's a big blessing. Once I surrendered and gave it over I never looked back and my husband did it with me so that support was amazing.'

Through confronting her fears, seeking therapy and more recently journaling every morning, Simpson said she is feeling empowered to have come through the other side.

'It just ended up coming to a surface. I knew a lot of it was coming up, coming up and I couldn’t suppress it any more. The alcohol was not numbing anything. It wasn’t numb anymore, I was just numb.

'I couldn’t even understand stuff that was coming out of my mouth, it didn’t sound like me. So I really had to get back inside the person that I am. When you do that self-reflection its very empowering.

'It takes a lot of courage. I can promise anyone on the other side of that fear, that courage is so beautiful and its one of the most rewarding things and decisions I have ever made in my life. And I never thought I would have to make that decision.'
