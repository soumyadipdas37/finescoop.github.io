Michael Cohen is heard laughing while a friend praises his daughter Samantha's body and tries to guess the size of her breasts, audio obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals.

President Trump's former personal lawyer chats at length with the unnamed friend over the course of the five minute recording about Samantha, now 24 - agreeing with the man that 'she's something'.

While the audio is not dated, it appears from the men's conversation that it was  recorded in late 2013 or early 2014. Samantha would have been aged 18 at the time.

Upon seeing a photo of Samantha, the man exclaimed: 'What the f**k is that? Holy s**t. My god. Holy s**t, she's gorgeous. What is she B-cup, C-cup? She's a good looking girl, man. Gorgeous. Look at this body man.'

After the friend drooled over the photos of his young daughter, Cohen eagerly pulls up photos of a shoot Samantha had recently done with Victoria's Secret photographer Russell James. 

During the conversation, Cohen repeatedly brings up knowing the former Victoria's Secret CEO and name drops James. There's also mention of Mikhail Prokhorov, a Russian politician and former owner of the Brooklyn Nets.

The discovery of the audio comes on the heels of Samantha supporting her father's claims in his new book that Trump made creepy comments towards her when she was just 15 years old.

In the audio, the two men talk about their families, with Cohen praising his son Jake's baseball talent, claiming that at age 14, he was already 6ft tall and throwing 77mph fast balls.

The conversation turns to Samantha, with the man saying: 'Your daughter I hear is amazing,' later adding that she's 'hot'.

Cohen agrees and laughs a bit, saying: 'She's gorgeous. Thanks, yeah.'

The man asks to see a photo of her, saying: 'Let me see your daughter... Boys tell me that people drool over her. '

Cohen replies: 'She's something.'

Upon seeing Samantha, the man raves about her appearance and comments on her body and breasts.

Cohen does nothing to stop the man talking in explicit terms about his teenage daughter's body, and continues to offer up more photos of her, bragging about a photo shoot she did with famed Victoria's Secret photographer Russell James.

He said: 'You know, she just did a photo shoot for Victoria's Secret. I'll show you the picture.'

She wrote: 'The amazing Russell James!' 

Cohen makes a point to tell the friend he's 'very friendly' with the then-CEO of Victoria's Secret Sharen Jester Turney, bringing the conversation back to knowing her multiple times.

Turney ran the lingerie company from 2006 until February 2016 when she suddenly stepped down. 

From the audio, it appears Cohen is going through photos on his phone with the man, pointing out a Victoria's Secret model that was 'his date for the night'.

The man asks who another woman is and Cohen says it was Real Housewives of New York former cast member Aviva Drescher.

The friend appears to continue scrolling through the photos, telling Cohen: 'Let me browse! Show me your daughter.'

Cohen half jokes: 'Leave my daughter alone.'

The man proclaims it's only 'boy's talk' and Cohen says 'yeah I know' and continues his story about being at the Victoria's Secret fashion show with CEO Turney.

However, the friend seems more interested in if Cohen can get him tickets to the Victoria's Secret fashion show than listening to his story.

Cohen brushes him off and tries to bring the conversation back to Victoria's Secret photographer Russell James.

Cohen said: 'So Russell James, who is probably the most important photographer, maybe in the country. You've never heard about Russell James?

The man replies: 'I don't give a s**t'.

Cohen shows a picture of James to the friend, saying: 'So she did the Victoria's Secret fashion shoot....'

The friend cuts Cohen off and goes into a rant, appearing to question why Cohen would allow Samantha to get into modeling.

He goes off topic and talks about models doing cocaine. The men's conversation shifts to business, with Cohen saying he would take someone out for dinner that night.

Cohen has previously landed in hot water for comments made about his daughter. Back in 2017, he was ridiculed on social media for posting an 'inappropriate' picture of her. The disgraced lawyer posted a black and white photograph of Samantha, then aged 21, during a modeling shoot, in which she was wearing black lingerie and leggings (pictured) 

Cohen repeatedly bringing up his ties to Victoria's Secret is odd, considering he hasn't ever been known to have a close relationship with the company.  

Jeffrey Epstein had also been known to bring up his connection to the company and his relationship with its billionaire owner Les Wexner to lure minors into his sex trafficking ring.

The disgraced lawyer posted a black and white photograph of Samantha, then aged 21, during a modeling shoot, in which she was wearing black lingerie and leggings.

He wrote: 'So proud of my Ivy League daughter...brains and beauty channeling her Edie Sedgwick.' 

Cohen seemed unfazed by the criticism. He even replied directly to one person who wrote: 'POTUS wants to date his daughter, the VP calls his wife 'mother,' and DJT's attorney posts spank-bank material of his daughter.'

Cohen wrote back to the person: 'Jealous?'

On Monday, Samantha sat down for an interview with CNN to talk about a series of 'creepy' comments she says Donald Trump made about her when she was 15 years old  

In the book, Cohen claims that in 2012 Trump whistled at his then-teen daughter as she was playing tennis, remarking 'what a piece of a**. I would love some of that.' After Cohen told Trump that she was his daughter, he allegedly replied 'when did she get so hot?', and then beckoned her over to come and kiss him on the cheek.

Her appearance on New Day came as Cohen's new book Disloyal: A Memoir hit bookshelves.

Speaking about the encounter, Samantha said it gave her the impression that Trump was interested in 'younger women.'

Trump, who was married to Melania at the time, also allegedly warned Samantha to 'be careful, I'll be dating your friends in a few years'.

'I didn't get the impression he was hitting on me directly,' Samantha said. 

'But I had the impression that he was interested in younger women and that, you know, women would age out for him and that when one woman became too old, he'd find a new younger one.'

While the nature of the alleged comments went 'over her head' at the time, Samantha said what she remembers most clearly of the exchange is how degrading Trump had been towards her father.

Samantha claimed Trump had remarked: 'Well there's no way she got her looks from you. Thank god you married a beautiful woman.'

'I was desensitized to men making creepy comments about me,' she said.

'But I was not desensitized to someone blatantly insulting and degrading my father in front of me - someone who I looked up to and loved very much, and that was very upsetting to me, and that made me think, okay, maybe Trump doesn't want to treat my father so well.'
