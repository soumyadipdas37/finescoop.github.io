A frantic search is underway for a missing teenager who disappeared after going swimming in a popular rock pool.

Emergency crews rushed to Mermaids Pool in Tahmoor, south west of Sydney at about 1.40pm on Thursday.

Authorities were told an 18-year-old swimmer didn't resurface after jumping into a rock pool.

Paramedics, fire and rescue authorities and police divers are at the scene looking for the missing teen.

A NSW Ambulance spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the teenager had still not been located.

The search party comes the day after aÂ 17-year-old boy drowned at an unpatrolled beach on the New South Wales mid north coast.

The teenager got into difficulties while swimming with his family at Diamond Beach near Hallidays Point, around 104km south of Port Macquarie, at 1pm on Wednesday.

Police pulled him from the water and started CPR, before paramedics arrived at the scene and took over but he was unable to be revived and died at the scene.

The tragedy happened at the same beach where a man, 38, drowned after getting caught in a rip earlier this year.

Around 248 people drowned in Australian waterways in 2019-20, according to the latest Royal Life Saving data released earlier this month.

Of those who drowned, 80 per cent were male.
