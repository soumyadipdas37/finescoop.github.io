Georgia has never been shy of showing off her figure on Instagram, and earlier this month posed up a storm in a sexy nude two-piece. 

She has also been making the most of the single life by going out with friends, ever since breaking up from her fiancé, Ibiza Weekender star Callum Izzard, 25, in April.

Speaking on FUBAR Radio, she revealed she's in no rush to jump into a new relationship.

She explained: 'I'm a good believer in everything happens for a reason and I'm just rolling with it.' 

The former couple's whirlwind romance began in August 2019 when they met during the filming of Ex on the Beach: Peak Of Love, with the pair becoming engaged just a month later.

When asked if she's had many guys sliding into her DMs, Georgia said: 'I just want some time now to just focus on myself and I'm not really wanting to rush into anything. I'm just wanting to take every day as it comes!'
