Callum Wilson has completed his £20million move to Newcastle United from Bournemouth and will take the No 9 jersey.

The striker finalised the terms of a four-year deal on Monday morning and will now meet his new team-mates ahead of Saturday's Premier League opener at West Ham.

His former Cherries team-mate Ryan Fraser is also expected to be unveiled as a Newcastle player on Monday afternoon, joining on a free transfer. 



Newcastle has completed the £20million signing of Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson 

Steve Bruce has landed his main attacking target in the 28-year-old forward Wilson

Wilson replaces Joelinton as the club's No 9 after the Brazilian - a £40m club-record buy last summer - scored just twice in the Premier League during his debut season.

The 28-year-old said: 'From the minute I knew that Newcastle were interested, it was definitely something that appealed to me.

'It's a massive club with great history. Along the years, they've had great strikers so if I can emulate half of what they've done, I'd like to attempt that.

'I believe in my ability as a player. As a striker I think it's important to set yourself goals long term and short term, and I'm hoping to achieve them.

'With the players around me, I believe we can get the goals we need as team and I want to help contribute to that.'  

Dwight Gayle is unlikely to be fit again until December after sustaining a knee injury 

Wilson scored seven times for Bournemouth last season but could not halt their relegation

Head coach Steve Bruce said: 'Callum is somebody I’ve admired for a long time and I’m delighted to get him.

'He has done fantastically well at Bournemouth and was deservedly playing centre forward for England less than two years ago.

'The club has worked ever so hard to get Callum here and we have beaten off competition from a number of clubs.

'I’m grateful the club has made it happen. Lee Charnley and those behind the scenes deserve a lot of credit.'
