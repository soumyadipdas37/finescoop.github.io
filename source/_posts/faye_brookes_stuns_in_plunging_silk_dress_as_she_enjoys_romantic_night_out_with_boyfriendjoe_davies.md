She went public with their romance late last year.

And Faye Brookes appears to be going from strength to strength with her boyfriend Joe Davies, as they enjoyed a romantic date night in Manchester on Saturday.

The former Coronation Street star, 33, cut an elegant figure in a plunging gold paisley dress, as she left a hotel in the centre of the city with her beau.

Faye teamed her pretty dress with a pair of strappy gold details, while toting her essentials in a leather bag, complete with a chain strap.

She wore her brunette locks in a bouncy voluminous style, while highlighting her pretty features with a full face of make-up in neutral tones.

Her beau looked equally stylish in an eye-catching printed shirt, which he wore with a black leather jacket and a pair of blue skinny jeans.

Their outing comes as Faye's ex-fiancé Gareth Gates, 36, is said to have found love with Ibiza DJ Chloe McLennan, having split from the actress last year.

Gareth celebrated his birthday last month with a group of family and friends, as well as with Chloe.

Posting a snap to Instagram, he added the caption: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'

He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.

A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'

Indeed, comments have materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth writing 'Mmmmm' under one of Chloe's sultry snaps.

Faye confirmed her new romance with personal trainer Joe Davies in late November as they made their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night.

During the night, the actress leaned into Joe as he placed a hand on the small of her back, indicating the friends had grown closer since Faye's relationship with Gareth ended last July.

And earlier this month, the couple put on an affectionate display as they walked hand-in-hand towards The Ivy restaurant in Manchester before posing for pictures.

In February, Gareth was linked to his panto co-star Hannah Grace Lawson, but this appeared to just be a friendship.
