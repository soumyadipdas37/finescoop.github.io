Wedding bells are about to start ringing at David Koch's place.

The Sunrise host's youngest daughter Georgie has become engaged to her beau Alex Merkel while living in London.

The father-of-four and grandfather-to-six - nicknamed Kochie - shared the couple's happy news with his fans on Instagram. 

Wedding bells! Sunrise host David Koch youngest daughter Georgie got engaged to her boyfriend Alex Merkel over the weekend 

He confirmed the family could not be happier to permanently welcome Alex into the brood.

'When your baby girl gets engaged,' Kochie captioned his post on Sunday.

'Congrats to @georgie_koch and "The German" aka @alex_merks... we couldn't be happier for you both.' 

In the Instagram photo, Georgie is pictured beaming as she wraps her arm around Alex and flashes her three stone engagement ring on her left hand.

Her fiancee looks very proud and can be seen wearing a Manly Longboard Co t-shirt. 

The iconic clothing label comes from near where Kochie lives with his wife Libby in Newport on Sydney's northern beaches. 

'And in the Manly T-shirt,' Georgie pointed out when she responded to a friend's comment.

Excited: The father-of-four and grandfather-to-six - nicknamed Kochie - shared the couple's happy news with his fans on Instagram 

The couple's news comes just days after Kochie and Sunrise co-host Samantha Armytage ended their part-time hosting arrangements with Channel Seven.

The presenters were ordered to return to host the breakfast show full-time from September 21 after Nine's rival program Today closed the ratings gap. 

The hosts had been enjoying working four days a week, with newsreader Natalie Barr filling in for Samantha on Mondays and for Kochie on Fridays.
