A British tourist was rushed to hospital in Portugal after being stabbed during a bungled street robbery. 

The 27-year-old woman was knifed in the arm by a masked mugger in Vialonga, an up-and-coming tourist destination north of Lisbon.

Local reports said the criminal fled empty-handed after seeing the amount of blood she was losing.

The stabbing occurred just before 7pm on Wednesday evening.

The victim was assisted at the scene before being taken to Vila Franca de Xira Hospital.

The unnamed Brit, who was with a female friend at the time, is said to have been stabbed in the arm.

No arrests are thought to have been made so far. 

British tourists in Portugal have to quarantine for two weeks when they return after the coronavirus restrictions were re-imposed last week. 

The quarantine rules do not apply to people returning from the islands of Madeira and the Azores. 

British visitors accounted for 2.1million of Portugal's foreign visitors last year, the second-biggest market after Spain.
