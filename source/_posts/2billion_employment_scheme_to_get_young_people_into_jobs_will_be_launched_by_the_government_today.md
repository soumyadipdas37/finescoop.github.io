A £2billion youth employment scheme is being launched today. 

Dubbed 'Kickstart', it is aimed at creating hundreds of thousands of jobs for the 'left-behind' under-25s.

The Government will also give £1,500 grants to help with support and training. Major employers including Tesco have signed up so far. 

The scheme, which will be delivered by the Department for Work and Pensions, will initially be open until December 2021. 

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: 'This isn't just about kickstarting our country's economy – it is an opportunity to kickstart the careers of thousands of young people who could otherwise be left behind as a result of the pandemic.

'The scheme will open the door to a brighter future for a new generation and ensure the UK bounces back stronger as a country.'  

Therese Coffey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, added: 'As we launch our £2 billion Kickstart programme, putting young people at the heart of our revival - we are urging businesses to get involved in this innovative scheme and take advantage of the enormous pool of potential out there.

'Young people taking part will receive on-the-job training, skills development and mentoring, as we get them on that first rung of the jobs ladder and on their way to successful careers.'
