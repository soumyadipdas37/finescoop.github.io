Manchester United are trying to drive down Porto's £17million price for left back Alex Telles. 

The 27-year-old is out of contract next summer and the clubs remain apart in valuation. United are awaiting a revised bid from Roma for defender Chris Smalling who has made it clear he wishes to leave. United rejected the last offer of around £12m. 

The Old Trafford club are also struggling to find buyers for Diogo Dalot, Sergio Romero, Marcos Rojo, Andreas Pereira and Phil Jones with few firm offers and the club's asking price for each understood to be an obstacle for suitors.

United have no plans to move on Jesse Lingard at this stage as they continue to seek another attacking option. Talks for Jadon Sancho have not progressed. 

Telles scored in Porto's opening Primeira Liga game against Braga with the reigning champions earning a 3-1 victory.

The impressive full back scored 13 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions for the Portuguese side in the 2019-2020 campaign.

His attacking prowess makes him an attractive option for United and he also helped his side keep 20 clean sheets in the league last season.

The Brazilian has been at Porto since 2016 and is closing in on 200 appearances in all competitions.

United missed out on their other left back target, Sergio Reguilon, to Tottenham with the Red Devils not prepared to accept a buy-back clause as part of deal.
