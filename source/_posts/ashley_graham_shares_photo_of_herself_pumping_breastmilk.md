Ashley Graham is a model, a television host, and an author, so it should come as no surprise to her fans that she is also a multitasking mom.   

The 32-year-old mom, who gave birth to her baby boy Isaac in January, took to her Instagram Stories on Friday to share a photo of herself pumping breastmilk while reading a book.  

In the headless snapshot, she is wearing a white tank top pulled over her breasts, which are strapped into her hands-free breast pump.

Busy mom: Ashley Graham, 32, shared a photo of herself pumping breastmilk on Friday. She and her husband Justin Ervin welcomed their son Issac in January 

A book is open on the table in front of her, and while it's unclear what she reading, she had highlighted one of the passages in pink. 

Ashley didn't caption the photo, but she has been candid about the realities of motherhood since she and her husband Justin Ervin welcomed their first child earlier this year.  

Hours later, she posted a video of herself squeezing the stretch marks on her stomach into the shape of a heart with her hands. 

'That beautiful belly carried and created a little human life,' model Helena Christensen commented.

Inspiration: After a fan thanked her for posting the video, Ashley responded in the comments, writing: 'We need to see ourselves everywhere'

'I love this so much I could cry,' someone else wrote. 'Real women have curves, stretch marks, C-section marks, you name it. Thank you for making the stigma disappear.'

Ashley responded to the woman in the comments, writing: 'We need to see ourselves everywhere.' 

The curvy model has always used her platform to promote body-positivity, and now that she is a mom, she is helping to normalize breastfeeding and stretch marks with her photos. 

Over the past year, she has shared candid images of herself nursing her baby boy as well as unretouched pictures of the stretch marks on her stomach.

Day in the life: The mom has also shared images of herself using her hands-free breast pump 

While appearing on the Today show last month, Ashley explained that becoming a mom has only added to her desire to promote self-confidence and self-love.  

'Now as a mother, I think it's even more important because I'm not just a role model for people who follow me, I'm a role model for [my son],' she said.

'And now having my body completely change, and stretch marks and extra weight and my hips and my stomach have shifted in new areas...

'I just want women to know that things will change, and it's most important to just continue to love yourself and to do that for the next generation.'
