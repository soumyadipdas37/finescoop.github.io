She is one of the fashion industry's most in-demand models.

And Ashley Graham ensured all eyes were on her as she took to the runway for Fendi at Milan Fashion Week on Wednesday.

The beauty, 32, was joined on the runway by her fellow A-list models including Yasmin Le Bon and Eva Herzigova for the high fashion event.

The outfit also featured a floral embellishment and a deep v-neckline while Ashley added height to her frame with a pair of baby blue heels.

The model styled her brunette locks into a chic updo for the show while she also wore a pair of gold hoop earrings.

Ashley, who previously served as a judge on America's Next Top Model, completed her look with a light pallet of makeup. 

Those in attendance at the A-list event included Rita Ora who showcased her incredible physique in a velour black blazer but suffered an awkward mishap as she arrived for the show.

Rita, 29, accidentally flashed her underwear in the thigh-skimming blazer, which had a v cut at the back and dramatic shoulder pads.

The Anywhere hitmaker seemed unperturbed by the fashion faux pas as she strutted into the catwalk show in knee-high fishnets and black heels.

She slicked her blonde hair back into a low bun and amped up the glamour with diamond earrings, a gold phone chain and gold shades.

Joining Ashley on the runway was Eva Herzigova who commanded the runway in a black top with structured shoulders and a matching skirt.

The garment also featured a leg split while Eva, 47, also wore a pair of white heels and carried a bright red clutch bag. 

Ashley became a mother this year when she welcomed her son Isaac in January with her husband Justin Ervin. 

The curvy model has always used her platform to promote body-positivity, and now that she is a mom, she is helping to normalise breastfeeding and stretch marks with her photos.

Over the past year, she has shared candid images of herself nursing her baby boy as well as unretouched pictures of the stretch marks on her stomach.

While appearing on the Today show last month, Ashley explained that becoming a mom has only added to her desire to promote self-confidence and self-love.

'Now as a mother, I think it's even more important because I'm not just a role model for people who follow me, I'm a role model for [my son],' she said.

'And now having my body completely change, and stretch marks and extra weight and my hips and my stomach have shifted in new areas...

'I just want women to know that things will change, and it's most important to just continue to love yourself and to do that for the next generation.'

Fendi opened Milan Fashion Week at the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome, which also houses the brand’s headquarters.

Ahead of the event WWD reported CEO Serge Brunschwig said the show will be 'a physical event, with a limited number of guests and a digital component, the format of which is being defined.'

On the catwalk, red and white were the predominant colours. Models headed down the runway in a variety floaty sheer dresses, structured suits and tulle skirts.
