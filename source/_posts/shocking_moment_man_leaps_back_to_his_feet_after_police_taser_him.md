A man was filmed jumping back to his feet almost immediately after being tasered by police during an arrest on a residential road.

Footage shows the man fall to the ground after an officer fires a taser gun at him on Church Road in Isleworth, West London, on Tuesday. 

However in a matter of seconds, the suspect leaps back to his feet before furiously shouting at the officer: 'You're going to die!' 

He is then tackled to the ground by five officers and arrested at the scene.

During the clip, two officers approach the man and try to detain him along residential street.

A male officer then fires his taser gun at the suspect and shouts: 'Taser! Taser!'

Within seconds, the man jumps back to his feet as the officer shouts: 'Do not move! Do not move!' 

However the man stands on the pavement and tells the officer: 'F*** off you p*** weed. You're going to die.'

Moments later, sirens are heard blaring in the background as the male officer stands with a baton in his hand and orders the man to get down on the ground, repeatedly telling him: 'Get down on the floor! Get down!'

The five officers manage to tackle the man to the ground and arrest him at the scene 

However, the man refuses to listen to the orders and even stands in a fight position, as the police officer swings his baton at him. 

With the man refusing to cooperate, three plain-clothed officers then arrive to the scene and assist their colleagues in tackling the suspect to the ground.  

The man was arrested at the scene.
