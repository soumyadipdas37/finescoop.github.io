Claire Williams paid tribute to her father, Sir Frank, on Sunday night, who took his leave of grand prix racing after one of the most remarkable contributions the sport has known.

Failing health prevented the 78-year-old boss of his eponymous team from travelling to Monza on Sunday, but his deputy and daughter waved the cars out of the garage for the final time.

There were tears at Williams, presents exchanged, interviews conducted - and in the middle of it a contest in which Nicholas Latifi finished 11th and George Russell 14th.

A new board appointed by American investment company Dorilton will now put their stamp on the organisation following a buyout last month.

Sir Frank has made way after half a century and 16 world championships.

Claire said: 'We have had a great time in this sport. My dad, with (Sir) Patrick Head, leaves an incredible legacy.

'Today the team gave me a present - the front wing assembly from the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix car.

'It is extraordinary what my dad has done. I am so proud of him. I have been inspired by him. This sport has given our family so much and we will be eternally grateful.'
