Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher has officially joined West Bromwich Albion on loan.

The England Under-21 international agreed a new contract with Chelsea before he travelled up to the Hawthorns to complete the formalities of his loan this afternoon.

Gallagher represents a major coup for Albion who tried to sign the 20-year old last season prior to him joining Swansea City on loan.

After completing his loan move, Gallagher said: 'There was a lot of interest from the Premier League, which is where I wanted to play this season, but this is where I want to be.

'West Brom stood out to me because of the way they played last season. I played against them two or three times and I liked how they approached the game.

'I felt that it would suit me and it would be best for my development. I felt it could help me become the player I want to be and I'm pleased to get this agreement sorted.'

Leeds United wanted to sign him in a permanent deal while Aston Villa and Newcastle also asked for him. 

Crystal Palace thought they had a deal lined up but, with Chelsea reluctant to rush his contract talks, Palace prioritised the signing of his club-mate Michy Batshuayi instead, subsequently scuppering any deal as they are unable to have two loans from the same club.

Gallagher is likely to go straight into contention for Saturday's clash with in-form Everton.
