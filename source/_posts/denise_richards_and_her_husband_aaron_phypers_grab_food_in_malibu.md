She chose to step away from The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills after only two seasons.

And Denise Richards was turning her attention back to her husband Aaron Pypers, 48, on Wednesday as the two stepped out in Malibu for food.

The 49-year-old actress traded out her usual glamorous looks in favor of a casual yet sporty ensemble.

Denise looked as if she had just come from a workout wit her black tank top, which revealed her fit arms.

She paired it with a low-key pair of black sweatpants with blue stripes and also wore black athletic shoes. 

The Wild Things star had a large tan Gucci bag under her arm, and she styled her brunette locks in a messy bun atop her head.

Aaron complemented his wife's casual style with a plain black T-shirt that exposed his bulging biceps, along with ripped jeans and gray boots.

Both Denise and Aaron were responsible and wore masks to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The reality star recently found herself with more time on her hands after she announced her departure from The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills after two seasons.

'I had a great first season. The second season was challenging,' she said Monday on The Real, which was hosted by her RHOBH costar Garcelle Beauvais.

'I just thought it was the right time for me to go and to just keep focusing on the other projects that I have. I had a great time. I will always be a fan and I will continue to support the show,' she continued.

Denise also left the door open to more reality TV opportunities, so her fans might see her on TV again soon enough. 

During her interview, she reserved special praise for her friend Garcelle, who provided a steadying presence on RHOBH.

'Garcelle, it almost makes me want to cry,' Denise said. 'I truly could not have gotten through the season without you, honestly. 

'She is a girl's girl, a good friend. Your loyalty is beyond and I really could not have gotten through this season without you.'

Denise was beset by claims on RHOBH that she and Brandi Glanville had carried on a secret affair.

Brandi, who is currently a guest on the series, claimed that the two women had a sexual encounter the first time they met in a restaurant bathroom.

She also said they later had sex on a trip to Mendocino, California, after Denise invited her to stay for the weekend while she filmed a movie there. 

Denise has been married since 2018 to Aaron , whom she began dating in late 2017.

Glanville claimed on RHOBH that her costar claimed she had an open relationship with her husband, before later reversing course and forbidding her to ever let him know of the alleged affair.

Denise's ex-husband Charlie Sheen, 55, recently told Page Six that he wasn't a part of his former wife's decision to leave the series.

'She does what she wants in these matters,' he said through his publicist Jeffrey Ballard, adding, 'And I applaud her decision of 'one and done.

Denise previously admitted to consulting with Charlie during an appearance on Andy Cohen's show Radio Andy. 

'I did talk to him about it because as an actor in this business, I respect his opinion too. So I said, "What do you think?" and he said, "I think it could be really cool,"' she recalled.

'Even if he said this is the dumbest thing you ever did, I still would have done the show. But it was interesting to get his side of it because I have a lot of respect for him as the father and being in this business for as many years as he has.' 

Bravo patriarchy Andy Cohen recently shared that the Wild Things star's departure was a matter of a stalled negotiation.

'I'm just sad we couldn't reach an agreement for next season,' the reality TV mastermind told PeopleTV's Reality Check on Monday. 'I'm kind of living in that sadness. 

'We were negotiating a deal with her and we couldn't reach an agreement on the deal,' he explained.
