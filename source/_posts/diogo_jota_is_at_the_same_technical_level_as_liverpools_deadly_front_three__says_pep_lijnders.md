Liverpool new boy Diogo Jota is at the same technical level as the deadly front three of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah, according to assistant coach Pep Lijnders. 

Jurgen Klopp's No 2 talked up the new £45million signing ahead of his possible debut against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup on Thursday evening. 

In the pre-game press conference, he said of the former Wolves man: 'You saw our schedule? He will win matches.

New Liverpool signing Diogo Jota is as good as the front three technically, says Pep Lijnders

'He is a player on the level of the front three technically, a pressing monster.'

Klopp has previously taken a while to bed in new signings and introduce them to first team football. 

But Lijnders thinks it should not take too long before Jota finds his feet. He added: 'The adaptation will hopefully be quite quick, with good players it is normally quite quick. He has to learn our game and the way we want to do things.

'When we see him play in the national team for Portugal we see them play 4-3-3, there are a lot of similarities between these two teams.

Jurgen Klopp's No 2 believes Jota will 'create solutions' and win games for Liverpool 

'He will play. He has been bought to create solutions for us.'

It is understood that Lijnders was a key factor in signing Jota after receiving reports of the player from his time at Porto in 2016/17. 

His Premier League debut for the Reds may come on Monday night when Liverpool welcome Arsenal to Anfield.  

Jota plays in a similar system in Portugal so his adaptation on Merseyside should be easy
