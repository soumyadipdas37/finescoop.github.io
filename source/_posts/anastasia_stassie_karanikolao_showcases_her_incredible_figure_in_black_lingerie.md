It comes after the Kardashian family denied reports that Kris Jenner decided to pull the plug on Keeping Up With The Kardashians after three of her daughters threatened to quit. 

It was suggested that the mother-of-six, 64, apparently called time on the show after 14 years when Kim Kardashian, 39, Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and Kylie, 23, all expressed their desire to end the programme.

However MailOnline now understands that it was a decision made by the whole family, not just one person and it was just as 'emotional' for everyone.

Discussing the decision to end the show with executive producer Ryan Seacrest on Wednesday, Kris said: 'I think the number 20 used to sound good until 2020, but the number 20 just seemed like the right time I think for us to take a minute and breathe and everybody slow down a bit… figure out what our next steps are.

'We've had such an amazing run and we're so grateful … for every single moment and everyone we work with.' 

The denial comes following The Sun's claims that the three sisters had made it clear they no longer wanted to appear on the show.

An insider told the publication: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

Discussing Kylie's departure, they added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'

They also noted that she is free to tour with her daughter Stormi's father Travis Scott.  

On Tuesday, Kim  shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show would be ending after 14 years on the air.
