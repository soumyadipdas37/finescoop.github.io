The new series of The Crown will portray the Queen and Margaret Thatcher as 'twins who are not the same', it's creator has revealed.

Peter Morgan has said learning the monarch and politician were born just six months apart was 'a breakthrough' for him when writing the fourth season of the hit Netflix programme. 

The drama, which premieres November 15, covers the span of time from 1977 to 1990 and sees Gillian Anderson's Margaret Thatcher joining Olivia Coleman's Queen Elizabeth in the show for the first time.

Speaking to Vanity Fair, Peter explained he had found many similarities between the two women, saying: 'They're both very resilient, very committed, work incredibly hard, have an extraordinary sense of duty. They're both really committed to the country.

'They both have a strong Christian faith. They're both girls of the war generation who switch the lights off when they leave a room.'

Both were also women in great power at a time when the world was not used to that dynamic, mothers of young adults, and from a rarified background. 

However, Peter added: 'But then they had such different ideas about running the country.'

Despite Peter's comments, it is believed the Queen and Thatcher will square off against one another in the new series.

Peter has said learning the monarch and politician were born just six months apart was 'a breakthrough' for him when writing the fourth season of the hit Netflix series (pictured, Olivia Coleman in the new series as Queen Elizabeth, Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip)

There have long been claims about tensions between the Queen and Lady Thatcher during her time in Downing Street, fuelled by suspicions of class tensions.

A book released in 2015, In The Queen And Mrs Thatcher: An Inconvenient Relationship, chronicles how the two women 'met and disliked each other on sight'.

Mr Palmer, a TV producer, wrote: 'For over a decade they quietly waged a war against each other on both a personal and political stage, disagreeing on key issues including sanctions against South Africa, the miners' strike and allowing US planes to bomb Libya using British military bases.' 

However, in later life the two women are said to have formed a stronger bond.

When Lady Thatcher died in April 2013 at the age of 88, the Queen attended her funeral at St Paul's Cathedral.

The Crown's creator has pointed to similarities between the two women, including their duty and strong Christian faith (pictured together in 1979) 

The Crown Series Four will begin as the 1970s are drawing to a close, with the Royal Family preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles who is still unmarried at 30.

It will document Diana's blossoming romance with Prince Charles, as the trailer features the moment she emerges to greet an army of photographers, along with crowds cheering her name as she travels the world on behalf of the monarchy. 

Meanwhile the British nation is struggling with the impact of the divisive policies introduced by Britain's first female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

Tensions between the Prime Minister and the Queen are expected to only get worse as Thatcher leads the country into the Falklands War, generating conflict within the Commonwealth.

Peter's comments come after new images from the series were released yesterday ahead of it's November premiere 

Photographs of the series released yesterday showcase the moment Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arrived at Downing Street in 1979 after being elected for the first time, supported by her proud husband Denis (played by Stephen Boxer). 

Some of the key moments featured have been given artistic licence and do not exactly replicate images taken of the Royal Family.

One example of this is a picture of Olivia, playing the Queen at the Royal Variety performance in 1984, alongside Tobias Menzies, who plays her husband Prince Phillip.

In reality the royal couple did not attend the annual showcase until the following year.

The fourth season of the hit drama will introduce new characters, including Gillian's Thatcher and Emma Corrin's Princess Diana (pictured) 

It was recently announced The Crown will run for six series instead of five.

Creator Peter revealed he decided to 'return to the original plan,' meaning Imelda will now appear for two series as an older Queen Elizabeth II.

Producers decided to a U-turn after their January announcement The Crown would end after its fifth series.

Peter said: 'As we started to discuss the storylines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons.'
