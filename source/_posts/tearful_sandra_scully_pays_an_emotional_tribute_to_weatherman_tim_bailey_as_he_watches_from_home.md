Sandra Scully paid tribute to Channel Ten weatherman Tim Bailey on Friday.

After presenting the news, the newsreader, 55, was emotional as she told Tim, 57, it's 'been a pleasure' working alongside him while he watched from home.

'Heavy hearts today, and Tim Bailey we're talking about you. On behalf of the team, it has been an absolute privilege, honour and such a pleasure to work alongside you my friend for the past 30 years,' she said.

She continued:'You have been a grinning, upbeat, bright and shining light in our day, every single day.'

'I know viewers feel the same. We simply couldn't say goodbye without seeing some of your finest moments, bringing a smile to all our dials', she said while she held back tears.

A video then played, sharing Tim's most memorable moments over the past 29 years at the network.

'You are gold, our very own ray of sunshine and from the entire team, everyone here at Ten Tim, you know we wish you all the best,' Sally said.

'We know the next chapter will be amazing just like you,' she ended.

Tim was sacked as part of Channel 10's brutal budget cuts last month, after 29 years at the network.

He enjoyed an illustrious career as a roving reporter and weather guru.

Tim began working for Channel 10 in 1980 after scoring a job as a reporter on Good Morning Australia with Mike Gibson and Kerri-Anne Kennerley.

The multi-talented journalist began doing the weather in 1996, and has remained in that role ever since.
