Kacey Musgraves split from her estranged husband Ruston Kelly, 32, in July after two-and-a-half years of marriage.

And 32-year-old country singer is attempting to put the past behind her by letting go of the quaint Nashville, Tennessee abode that she shared with Ruston.

Musgraves recently listed the 1,293-square-foot home, which was built in 1926, for $359,000, according to Homes.com.

 

Moving on: Kacey Musgraves is letting go of the quaint abode that she shared with ex Ruston Kelly, 32, located in Nashville, Tennessee

The Southern-style property boasts a spacious concrete porch and features Tiffany blue accents that pop out against its predominantly white exterior.

The thoughtfully placed greenery at the front of the home allows for maximum privacy and an overall cozy feel.

Once guests and occupants make their way through the front door, they are instantly drawn to the original hardwood floors that dominate every inch of the space.

There are two bedrooms and one bathroom, as well as a screened-in porch and a shed in the backyard. 

As you make your way from the living room to the kitchen, you must pass through a sectioned off dining space perfect for an intimate dinner.

Complete with white cabinetry and coordinating crown molding, the nearly 100-year-old house's kitchen set-up is undeniably airy and leads directly into the sunroom.

Unlike the rest of the home, which features pale grey walls, the sunroom is given an added sense of brightness due its unique white wood panel walls and ceiling.

Like the living room, the sunroom also happens to have a fireplace, which gives the room a more rustic feel.

As you swing open the wood doors that lead outside, guest and occupants come face to face with a tranquil, screened in back porch.

Beyond the porch is more overrun greenery and plenty of grassy space to play around in. 

The master bedroom includes two large windows that allow a ton of light to flood the room and is just big enough to sleep a couple comfortably.

The second bedroom features a more narrow layout and appeared to be the perfect place for Kacey and Ruston to store their instruments, while also offering a place for guests to lay their heads.

The former couple recently finalized the terms of their divorce just months after announcing the end of their relationship.

Kacey and Ruston, who wed in October of 2017, are currently waiting on a judge to sign off on the final divorce decree, according to TMZ.

Part of their agreement includes selling the Nashville home, with Kacey receiving 84.4% of the sale while Ruston receives the rest.
