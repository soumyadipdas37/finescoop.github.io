The Governor of the Bank of England last night piled pressure on Rishi Sunak to provide more help for businesses hit by the latest Covid restrictions.

In a rare political intervention, Andrew Bailey asked the Chancellor to ‘rethink’ the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month.

Mr Bailey has previously backed the decision to bring the £40billion job subsidy scheme to an end. 

But addressing a British Chambers of Commerce event yesterday, Mr Bailey said some sectors will need more help as the scheme ends.

He said he did not want to ‘tie the Chancellor’s hands’ by offering a specific remedy.

He said ‘we’ve moved from a world of generalised employment protection’ to ‘focused areas,’ so a blanket scheme was no longer needed – but that it was time to ‘stop and rethink the approach going forward’.

In the Commons yesterday, Boris Johnson hinted that Mr Sunak was preparing new assistance for the hardest-hit sectors, and said the Government would do ‘everything we can to protect lives and livelihoods’.

Labour yesterday stepped up its call for the scheme to be extended – something Mr Johnson and the Chancellor have repeatedly ruled out.

In its current form, the scheme pays 80 per cent of the wages of those signed up. 

But with the restrictions now likely to last months, some Tories also urged the PM to come forward with more financial support.

Business groups yesterday warned that additional financial support would be essential, amid fears that the government’s new Covid restrictions could stifle the economic recovery for months.

Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said it was ‘desperately urgent to have a successor to the furlough scheme’.

She added: ‘It has saved thousands and thousands of jobs but there is a cliff-edge looming. And, now, with today’s announcement that is more urgent than ever.

‘We are calling for the Treasury to announce a successor scheme very quickly. It should be more targeted. 

It doesn’t need to be quite as generous. But, if we are going to protect jobs... in the medium-term it needs to be brought in within days or weeks.’

Roger Barker, of the Institute of Directors, said the new restrictions would ‘inevitably put the brakes on the economic recovery’.

He said businesses would accept the clampdown if it helped head off even more draconian restrictions, but said ministers now had a duty to support the economy.

‘With the return of more restrictions, the onus is squarely on the Government to set out the next phase of its support.

‘Key schemes are set to wind down in the months ahead, but it’s clear that businesses aren’t out of the woods yet.

Even where the Treasury wants to move away from the current shape of flagship measures, it should look to fill the gap to prevent a steep rise in unemployment and insolvencies.’

Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, yesterday asked for a ‘guarantee’ that the government will ‘continue to support Scottish employers and workers in areas affected by the measures when the furlough scheme ends’.
