She's making a sensational comeback to the ITVBe show after a nine-year absence to celebrate its milestone 10th anniversary. 

And Amy Childs proved there's no rest for the wicked as she continued to film scenes for The Only Way Is Essex in the county late last month.

The OG castmember, 30, caught the eye in a flowy maxi dress as she joined hazmat suit-wearing Chloe Sims and Georgia Kousoulou for a spot of bee-keeping in a field.

Commanding attention, the reality TV star icon looked sensational in the shirted ensemble, which she teamed with a Gucci waistbelt.

The media personality amped up the glamour by sporting a pair of patent nude heels, which worked well with her chain-strap designer handbag.

A gold watch, massive shades and hooped earrings served as her accessories for her outdoor adventure.

With her blonde tresses styled into a half up half down 'do, Amy complemented her beauty with dewy make-up.

Amy, who is a mum to daughter Polly, three, and son Rich, 21 months, briefly returned to TOWIE for the special 200th episode in 2016 but hasn't been a regular on the show since 2011.

She departed after being offered a rumoured £200,000 to appear on the relaunched Celebrity Big Brother.

ITV2 chiefs were said to have put their foot down as they didn't want TOWIE stars appearing on other reality shows.

During her time on TOWIE, the mother-of-two introduced the vajazzle to viewers across the nation and claimed she wanted to be 'bigger than Jordan.'

In a chat with The Sun, Amy spoke about her return as she shared: 'It is me having a laugh again. I feel like I am enjoying work again.

'I felt like I really needed this to get my confidence back. I was focusing on my kids and my business and I needed this to focus on myself again, so that definitely means seeing me more on TV.' 

Her best lines have been revisited in a new clip in promotion of the special edition. For the video, the beauty struts around, showing off her curves in black swimwear before speaking from a hot tub.

She says: ‘TOWIE’s 10? Oh shut up! I’m ready for a party!’
