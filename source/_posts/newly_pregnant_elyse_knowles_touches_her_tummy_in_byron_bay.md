She announced she's expecting her first child with boyfriend Josh Barker, earlier this month.

And on Tuesday, pregnant Elyse Knowles was spotted looking positively glowing during a lunch outing in Byron Bay.

The 27-year-old model was effortlessly chic, sporting a pretty white tank and matching shorts for the occasion.

Elyse's top revealed a hint of her tummy, which she touched tenderly.  

The gorgeous blonde showed off her long, tanned pins as she stepped out following the surprise baby announcement, accessorising with a pair of comfortable brown flat sandals and an orange fedora.

Elyse complimented her look with an over-the-shoulder bag of the same colour, and wore a pair of trendy sunglasses to shield her eyes from the spring sunshine.

The beauty and her boyfriend Josh have only recently returned from the Northern Territory, where they chose to announce their pregnancy news.

The model shared the joyful news to her Instagram page on Wednesday night.

'And then there were 3 #babybarker,' she wrote alongside a gallery of images of the couple on holiday.

The announcement came four months after Elyse and Josh bought a $2.3million beach house in Byron Bay.

Their new 1960s built property is located in the old part of Byron Bay town, just a short walk from the main beach and surrounded by tranquil greenery.

Last year, Elyse told Daily Mail Australia that the couple had moved to Byron Bay from Melbourne while chasing a more sustainable lifestyle for themselves.

Speaking at an event in September, the model explained she'd physically confront strangers that she would see littering in Victoria, before eventually leaving.

She explained: 'I just can't see it being left on the ground and when they're dropping rubbish, I think they need to be told off.'
