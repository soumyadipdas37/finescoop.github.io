Australia wants to improve ties with India as tensions with China, the nation's largest trading partner, escalate in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

A country of 1.4billion, India is as key export market for Australian goods and services as the federal government looks to diversify away from Beijing. 

Hayden, a father of three, has the highest Test score by an Australian with his 380 not out against Zimbabwe in 2003.

He played 103 Tests for his nation, scoring 30 centuries.

Since retirement in 2009, Hayden has been living in his home state of Queensland and has been an advocate for various health, youth and charitable organisations.

In 2010 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to cricket, and to the community.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne welcomed Hayden's appointment in a statement on Monday.
