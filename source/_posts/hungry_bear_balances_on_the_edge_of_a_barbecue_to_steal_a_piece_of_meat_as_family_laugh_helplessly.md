A black bear was caught on camera acrobatically balancing on the edge of a barbecue to steal a piece of meat from an unsuspecting family. 

The footage was recorded in the municipality of Santiago, Nuevo Leon, in the western part of Mexico.

The family had hired a rural property to enjoy some time in the countryside but had not counted on the arrival of the unexpected visitor.

In the clip, which is about a minute long, the hungry bear can be seen standing precariously on the edge of the built-in barbecue as meat sizzles on the grill. 

It outstretches its paw to scoop up some of the supplies as members of the shocked family laugh nervously and shout: 'Bear! No! No!' 

The wild animal looks around casually but is undeterred and reaches down once again.

This time it knocks off a metal pan, full of already grilled meat, which clatters noisily to the ground.

The family helplessly look at each other in disbelief as one says 'look at the claws' and another adds 'he is hungry'. 

The bear then snatches up a mouthful of meat before jumping down from the wall where it is joined by a younger cub as the pair feast on the meal.

'He only wanted a piece' says one woman as another adds: 'Dad, don't get close! Don't you understand he is eating?'

Since the pandemic began, it is more common to see black bears roaming around various parts of Mexico, according to the Mexican Newspaper Excelsior.

It is thought that because there are fewer people on the streets, due to coronavirus restrictions, more wild animals are taking a chance to venture into built up areas. 

Mexico has registered 680,931 cases of COVID-19 and 71,978 related deaths, according to the latest figures from the Johns Hopkins University.
