Teddi Mellencamp defended her All In weight loss program in an Instagram video posted Tuesday, after receiving criticism over the program's restrictive nature. 

The 39-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star did not address any of the specific points of concern being raised on social media but stood by the program saying she was 'so incredibly proud of the over 15,000 lives we have helped change.' 

Experiences of alleged former clients of the program were shared by influencer Emily Gellis, as they claimed to be initially restricted to approximately 500 calories while being required to do a daily hour of cardio.

'For one, I wanted to say I love All In,' Teddi said in the fresh faced video. 'I am so incredibly proud of the over 15,000 lives we have helped change.' 

Mellencamp stuck by her program, which boasts 106k followers on Instagram. 

'100 percent feel confident in the fact that we let you know before signing up exactly what the program entails,' she said, though she did not go into specifics about the program. 

Adding: 'If it’s something that you want to do and you want us to hold you accountable to your goals, we are there to do that for you.'

For people who were not fans of the program, the mother-of-three said 'If it’s not something you want to sign up for, you don’t. That’s why I love that we are very transparent from the beginning.' 

She ended the video by saying: 'We believe in you. We will fight for you, and we know that the best is yet to come.' 

Her comments come after influencer Emily Gellis began sharing mostly anonymous accounts of clients who have used Mellencamp's program and struggled with the highly restrictive diet, intense time with cardio and alleged aggressive nature of the brand's coaches. 

Former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Camille Grammer called the weight loss program 'suspect' in a tweet on Tuesday.

Twitter brawl: Former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Camille Grammer called the weight loss program 'suspect' in a tweet on Tuesday. Kyle Richards, Mellencamp's close friend and co-star, defended the star and her program in response to Grammer writing 'Camille, you really need to move on and get a life' 

Back and forth: Grammer and Richards went back and forth on Twitter getting into personal territory 

Life change: All In was launched after Mellencamp lost 80 pounds following weight gain from IVF and pregnancy with her son Cruz, age five (Pictured on Instagram at an unknown date)

Kyle Richards, Mellencamp's close friend and co-star, defended the star and her program in response to Grammer writing 'Camille, you really need to move on and get a life.' 

All In was launched after Mellencamp lost 80 pounds following weight gain from IVF and pregnancy with her son Cruz, age five. 

'At my heaviest, I felt lonely, sad and angry. At my smallest, I felt panicked, stressed and worried that I would gain the weight back,' Mellencamp's About page on the All In website reads.  'I very rarely felt great in my own skin.'

Adding: 'After struggling to get pregnant with my son and undergoing multiple IVF treatments, I gained 80+ pounds. I was thrilled to have my healthy baby boy but was left feeling broken inside. In order to be the best mom, wife and version of myself I knew things needed to change!' 

Programs: The program, which prides itself on 'accountability' has four different levels starting with a two-week Jumpstart plan before clients can move to the Monthly program, Weight and Workout and then maintenance. All In also offers a postpartum plan, that Mellencamp has advertised on her own social media after welcoming her daughter Dove six months ago

According to the program's website the employees do not have fitness, medical or health certifications but are handpicked by Mellencamp and must complete the program themselves, including coaches assigned to every client and can move clients through the program's steps,.  

In screenshots shared by Gilles, clients and certified dietitians claimed that meal plans from the program that were shared publicly are less than 600 calories, while requiring an hour of cardio a day. 

Experiences: Clients shared their experiences with Gellis to be posted, with one writing that the coaches were 'unhelpful,' and another writing that the 'restrictive' diet was 'unhealthy and hurt my body more longterm than it helped short term,' as they gained the weight lost back

Restrictive: Clients claimed they had to eat only plain broth for dinner during the two-week Jumpstart program and maintain a diet of 500 calories. A representative for All In said that the plans range from '750-1110' calories in an email appearing to be from the brand. Gellis called out Richards while sharing the email, 'Are you sure you want to stand by your BFF Teddi?' as she took issue with the still extremely restrictive calories, weigh-ins and daily hour of cardio

Gellis called out Richards while sharing the email, 'Are you sure you want to stand by your BFF Teddi?' as she took issue with the still extremely restrictive calories, weigh-ins and daily hour of cardio. 

A medically reviewed Everyday Health report said that 'people need a minimum of 1,200 calories daily to stay healthy,' as bodies naturally burn a number of calories at rest. 

Other clients claimed that plain broth for dinner was required during the Jumpstart phase was the only meal allowed. That same former client went on to claim that after those two weeks you were allowed one 'cheat meal' in which you could add green vegetables or protein to the broth. 

Report: A registered dietitian messaged Gellis asking her followers to 'report' All In to the 'dietics licensing board in their state,' claiming that the program was 'violating licensing laws and causing harm from nutrition coaching' 

Not one: The influencer wrote a post herself saying 'Not one medical professional has messaged me saying this diet is OK' 

Doctor disapproves: A user, who claims to be a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine responded to Gellis post saying 'Because it's NOT! It's literally starvation! And then pushing your body beyond its means with ONE HOUR cardio without sustenance! Forget doctors, even trainers wouldn't approve of this'
