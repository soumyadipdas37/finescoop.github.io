Emily Ratajkowski has been enjoying a getaway to the Hamptons with husband Sebastian Bear-McClard and their dog Colombo.

But the Inamorata founder is ready to return home to New York City and get back to her daily routine.  

She served totally chill vibes Tuesday in an oversized blue printed t-shirt with orange sweatpants, as she and Sebastian loaded their luggage into a car.

The 29-year-old accessorized the cozy travel ensemble with a pair of gold hoop earrings and some white sneakers.

Sebastian, 39, also went for a colorful normcore look in an oversized white printed t-shirt, yellow floral shorts and black sneakers with tie-dye socks. 

Emily has been keeping busy during her summer vacation, promoting her clothing line Inamorata on Instagram.

It comes after she and Bear-McClard spent the majority of their quarantine in their Los Angeles home.

They caught a flight out of JFK in April, shortly after the CDC issued an advisory, asking 'residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.'

She previously told British GQ: 'You know, [my husband and I] have been a little bit on the fence. My parents are in California, but as we know the responsible thing is to not travel right now.

'But eventually we would like to make it out there just because, well, New York is the epicenter, although my bodega is still open. I live in Tribeca and it is already very quiet.'

Ratajkowski and her hubby returned to the Big Apple back in June, as they were spotted arriving at JFK.
