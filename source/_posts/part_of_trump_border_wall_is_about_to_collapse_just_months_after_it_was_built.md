Part of Donald Trump's border wall is set to collapse just months after it was constructed due to erosion, a new engineering report has warned.

The report, which is one of two studies to be filed to federal court later this week, found that the border wall along the shore of Rio Grande is at risk of buckling due to construction flaws.

The three-mile private border was only built earlier this year by North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel, the Texas Tribune reported.

The documents, which were initially reported on by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, found that sections of the fence were at risk of overturning if the erosion was not fixed and maintained.

Tommy Fisher, the company's owner, had previously dismissed the concerns as normal post-construction issues.

The border wall was partly funded by private donors from We Build the Wall nonprofit, who raised more than $25million to help President Donald Trump's project.

But the organisation is at the centre of an indictment after founder Brian Kolfage, former Trump chief strategist Bannon, 66, and two others linked with the firm are accused of siphoning donor money to pay off personal debt. All four men have pleaded not guilty.

 Bannon, who was forced out of the White House, is accused of getting $1million in the alleged scheme, spending hundreds of thousands on 'expenses'. 

We Build the Wall had also hired Fisher's company to build a half-mile section of the fence in Sunland Park, New Mexico.

Fisher previously deemed the Rio Grande fence the 'Lamborghini' of border walls, bragging that 'the wall will stand for 150 years'.

But engineer Alex Mayor, a civil engineering professor at the University of Texas, instead likened the wall to a '$500 used car'.

He added: 'It seems like they are cutting corners everywhere.'

Last year, Fisher agreed to an inspection of the border as part of ongoing lawsuits, filed by the National Butterfly Centre and the International Boundary and Water Commission.

But the proceedings did not convince a federal judge to halt construction of the wall until the impact of the Rio Grande section were discovered.

Environmental engineer Mark Tompkins said in a separate report that there had been erosion and scouring at the border due to heavy rain.

The river management expert concluded: 'Fisher Industries' private bollard fence will fail during extreme high flow events.'

Tompkins also slammed Fisher Sand and Gravel's quarterly inspection maintenance plans as 'completely inadequate'.

But Donald Trump has attempted to distance himself from the project this month. 

He said: 'I know nothing about the project, other than I didn't like — when I read about it, I didn't like it. I said, "This is for government. This isn't for private people".'
