Sheffield United have reportedly made a £17million bid for Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster and are crucially open to the prospect of a buy-back clause. 

Brewster's future has been up in the air in recent weeks, with the 20-year-old forward interesting both Chris Wilder's side and Crystal Palace.  

While Palace are reluctant to a deal including a buy-back clause - which the Reds are demanding - the Blades are more open and according to The Sun have made an improved £17m bid today, which includes the option of Jurgen Klopp bringing Brewster back to Anfield for £40million.

Chris Wilder's Sheffield United have made a £17m bid which includes a buy-back clause

The report details that though Brewster would prefer a move to London and therefore Palace, United's willingness to include a buy-back clause means they are now the frontrunners. 

However, Palace are prepared to offer more money than the Blades in a bid to land the England Under-17 World Cup winner, but will not allow Liverpool the option to buy Brewster back for a set price in the future. 

Alternatively, Roy Hodgson and his staff could switch their attention to Celtic forward Odsonne Edouard as an option up front. 

Wilder's interest in Brewster has grown after his side went three Premier League games without a goal at the beginning of the new season and remain pointless following a 1-0 defeat at home to Leeds Utd on Sunday. 

Brewster looks set to leave Anfield before the transfer window closes, despite scoring three times in two pre-season games in August.

Brewster was left out of the Liverpool squad which beat Lincoln in the Carabao Cup last week

But with the signing of Diogo Jota, Brewster is now further down the pecking order up front and was not even in the matchday squad for the Reds' 7-2 win against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup third round on Thursday. 

He is yet to score a goal in competitive competition for Liverpool and missed the crucial penalty in the Community Shield shoot-out defeat to Arsenal at the end of last month.   

The 20-year-old will however be hoping for a call-up for Liverpool's League Cup fourth round clash against the Gunners on Thursday night.
