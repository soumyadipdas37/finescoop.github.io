Denise Van Outen dressed up to the nines to leave her cabaret show at Proud Embankment on Monday night. 

The former Big Breakfast icon, 46, looked incredible wearing a black and white zebra print mini dress as she was pictured leaving Proud Embankment. 

She wore a pair of heeled ankle boots as she headed out to her waiting car and added a pop of colour to her look with a slick of bright red lipstick.

The Cabaret star is understood to have 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month. 

A source told the publication: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'   

The mother-of-one is a natural performer after reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012.

She also played Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway and in the West End. 

The TV star is set to start training for the show but is yet to find out who her professional partner is, according to the Daily Star.  

Denise rose to fame on The Big Breakfast in 1997 and has recently starred alongside her boyfriend Eddy Boxshall on Channel 4's Celebrity Gogglebox.
