England will face New Zealand at Wembley in November as Gareth Southgate ramps up his preparations for the European Championship.

The Football Association has confirmed Southgate’s side will face the All Whites on November 12 ahead of their UEFA Nations League ties against Belgium and Iceland later that month.

The game is scheduled to be played behind-closed-doors, in keeping with the Government’s current guidelines.

The FA had hoped to have supporters back at Wembley in time for the friendly against Wales on October 8 but the rising Covid numbers in the UK have put plans to allow partial crowds back into stadiums in jeopardy.

England have played New Zealand twice previously, with both matches coming during a 1991 summer tour.

Under Graham Taylor, the visitors won 1-0 on June 3 in Auckland, courtesy of Gary Lineker’s late goal before a 2-0 win five days later in Wellington thanks to strikes from Stuart Pearce and David Hirst.
