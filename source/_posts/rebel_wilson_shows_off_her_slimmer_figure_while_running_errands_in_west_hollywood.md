She partied with the stars and royalty while visiting Monaco over the weekend.

But Rebel Wilson was back to her daily grind in West Hollywood on Monday.

The Cats star started her week off by taking care of some errands while showing off her newly fit figure in a plain white shirt.

Rebel paired the button-up long sleeve design with a pair of black leggings highlighting her slimmed-down legs.

She kept her colorless look simple but added a set of white sneakers decorated with metal studs for a bit of flair.

The 5ft3in Jojo Rabbit actress had her long blonde locks pulled back and styled in a high bun.

She blocked out the sun with a stylish pair of cat-eye sunglasses and ad her iPhone gripped tightly in her hand as she climbed out of her black SUV.

Earlier in the day, Rebel shared some throwback photos and videos on Instagram from her weekend getaway to Monaco with her new beau Jacob Busch.

'Yeah, baby!' she cried out in one clip as she throttled her jet ski while filming herself.

Prior to the post, she shared another short video of herself cuddling up with Jacob aboard a yacht.

Rebel's new boyfriend is a multimillionaire descended from Adolphus Busch, the co-founder of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company.

The 29-year-old, who also co-owns his own brewery, previously dated the former Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof.

Rebel and Jacob were visiting Monaco to attend the opening of an exhibit devoted to the work of Spanish surrealist painter Joan Miró.

While visiting the playground of the rich, she rubbed shoulders with Albert II, Prince of Monaco.

Some of her celebrity friends attending the event included fellow actresses Helen Mirren, 75, and Kate Beckinsale, 47.

The group, which posed together as they were about to board a helicopter, also included Mirren's husband, director Taylor Hackford, 75, and a friend of Beckinsale's.
