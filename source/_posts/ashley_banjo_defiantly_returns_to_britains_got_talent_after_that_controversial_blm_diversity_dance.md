Ashley Banjo will make a defiant return to Britain's Got Talent on Saturday, after a week of controversy surrounding his Black Lives Matter inspired dance with Diversity.

The choreographer, 31, flashed a broad smile as he joined his fellow judges in the pre-recorded second semi final show - including Alesha Dixon, 41, who publicly supported him amid the backlash. 

The hit ITV show's Ofcom complaints have soared to 15,500 following the dance troupe's divisive routine.

Standing tall: Ashley Banjo will make a defiant return to the Britain's Got Talent stage on Friday after a week of controversy surrounding his Black Lives Matter inspired dance with Diversity

Ashley cut a dapper figure in a dark print and a monochrome graphic print T-shirt as he happily joined judges Alesha, David Walliams and Amanda Holden to film the show - which will be aired on Saturday.

The star appeared in a chipper mood despite the drama surrounding his performance last week, which became the second most complained about TV moment of the decade.

Also present was Alesha, who gave her support to the group and hit back at a troll, telling them to 'kiss my black a**' on Thursday night.

The former MisTeeq singer didn't appear to let the furore phase her as she stunned in a hot pink number.

Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show on Saturday night due to its overtly political stance. 

An Ofcom spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline on Friday afternoon that Britain's Got Talent has received 15,500 complaints so far. On Monday the figure stood at 1,121. 

They added: 'We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'

The new figures come after Alesha told critics to 'kiss my black a**' as she threw her support behind Ashley after he shared a post on Instagram from a critic telling him to keep politics out of entertainment.

Alesha commented under an Instagram post from a disgruntled social media user, who said: 'We the Great British Public will only support you if you entertain us and do not say anything about racism.'

The comment referred to the BLM-inspired dance which has sparked more than 15,000 complaints to media watchdog Ofcom when it was performed on Britain's Got Talent on Saturday night.

Update: Britain's Got Talent Ofcom complaints have soared again to 15,500 as dance troupe Diversity's Black Lives Matter performance continues to divide viewers 

Powerful: Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show on Saturday night 

Critics claimed the dance, which was a 'take on the unprecedented events of 2020', had politicised the entertainment show, with one Twitter user insisting 'they are a dance group not a political movement.' 

The full post - which also referred to boxer Anthony Joshua and F1 champion Lewis Hamilton - read: 'Dear Joshua, Hamilton, Banjo and any other black public figures.  

'We the Great British Public will only support you if you entertain us and do not say anything about racism. Thank you for your understanding.'  

Support: Alesha waded into the ongoing row about the politicisation of the ITV1 talent series as Banjo shared a post on Instagram from a critic telling him to keep politics out of entertainment 

How about that: The new figure comes after Alesha told critics to 'kiss my black a**' as she threw her support behind Ashley 

Ashley shared a screenshot of a message written by a critic to his Instagram, and said in the caption: '1. You do not represent or speak for the Great British public. 

'2. Silence was never and will never be an option. 3. Change is inevitable... Get used to it.' 

Meanwhile, a new batch of semi-final hopefuls graced the stage once more in their bid to make it to the grand final.
