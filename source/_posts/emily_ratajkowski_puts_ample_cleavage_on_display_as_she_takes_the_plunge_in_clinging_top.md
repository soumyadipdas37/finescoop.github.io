Emily Ratajkowski put her ample cleavage on display as she took the plunge in a clinging walnut brown tank top this weekend.

The 29-year-old supermodel posted a busty selfie to her Instagram page this Saturday while lounging in bed in the Hamptons.

She modeled an elegant hairdo and a smattering of jewelry, telling her 26.7 million followers she was 'Just dropping in.'

Emily sizzled up a storm in a couple of leggy new snaps promoting her clothing line Inamorata which began as a swimwear brand.

However she has also gone into dresses and could be spotted modeling a springtime chic green and black polka-dot dress.

The smoldering sensation also posed for social media in her bias-cut $165 white and wine-colored split Orchard Dress.

Emily landed one of the 100 different new star-studded covers that have come out for the September issue of Vogue Italia.

She is married to the dashing Sebastian Bear-McClard, a producer who worked on the Adam Sandler vehicle Uncut Gems and goes by the nickname 'SeBo.'

The couple recently decamped to the Hamptons after previously self-isolating at their home in New York City, before which they were on the west coast.

Emily, her beefcake producer husband and their dog Colombo spent much of lockdown at her parents' house in Los Angeles.

They fled New York City while it was the American epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic and flew out to California on April 15.

The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention had issued an advisory on March 28 asking 'residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.'

However in late June as COVID-19 cases spiked dramatically in California, Emily and Sebastian crossed back to New York.
