True crime author Shanna Hogan died last week, two days after apparently tripping and falling into her family pool. 

The 38-year-old had been at home in Phoenix, Arizona, when her husband Matt LaRussa says he came home to find her unresponsive.

She had been swimming with their 15-month-old son Zander, he said, who was unharmed. 

Matt says he pulled his wife of 20 years from the water and gave her CPR. 

Shanna Hogan was pronounced dead on September 1, three days after falling into the pool while she was swimming with her 15-month-old son, Zander

She was taken to the hospital but had suffered such severe brain damage that she did not recover and on September 1, was pronounced dead. 

He announced her death on Facebook and said the family had opted for her organs to be donated. 

'I am so broken by losing Shanna my best friend for almost twenty years. 

'But I know the her gifts have already save 4 people and I know their will be more people she will save. 

'I would give anything in the world to have her back and hold her for ever, but that was not our story. I am so thankful for the 20 years. 

'And have so many memories that I will never forget and be sure to teach our son who Shanna was nd to be a great man. I will never forget her,' he wrote. 

Hogan was a New York Times bestseller and was best known for her book about the Jodi Arias murder trial 

Now, he is trying to raise $100,000 on a GoFundMe account to pay for her medical bills and to 'raise Zander without a mother'. 

Hogan was a New York Times bestseller and celebrated true crime author who was best known for her book, Picture Perfect: the Jody Arias Story.

In 2013, Arias was convicted of murdering her boyfriend Travis Alexander five years earlier. 

Hogan became an expert on the crime and was regularly asked to comment on it on true crime shows. 

She had several other true crime books which she sold on Amazon.
