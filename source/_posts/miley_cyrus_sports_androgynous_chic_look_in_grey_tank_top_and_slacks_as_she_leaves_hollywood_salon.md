Miley Cyrus has served several iconic performances over the past month, ahead of her seventh studio album She Is Miley Cyrus.

And the Grammy nominee is maintaining her glam rocker look, as she prepares for her next big appearance.

She got a tune-up for her signature fashion mullet Tuesday, as she sported an androgynous chic look in grey, after getting a trim at a salon in Hollywood.

The 27-year-old donned a grey tank top with matching pleated slacks and a pair of black leather high-heeled boots.

The former Disney Channel star previously rocked a one-shoulder black sequined Cong Tri dress for her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon earlier this month.

She gave a performance of Midnight Sky, the lead single she dropped last month from She Is Miley Cyrus, along with a psychedelically stylized music video.

Miley performed the track for the first time last month at the MTV Video Music Awards, where she brought back a disco ball version of her iconic Wrecking Ball moment from 2013. 

She later opened up on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast about a sexist encounter she experienced during the awards show.

The We Can't Stop artist recounted: 'I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s***. I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light. 

'The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f***ing lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn't turn the beauty light off.'

Miley continued: 'They said, "Okay, we'll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys," because that's what I want. And then something that I was doing... for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s*** and they said, "You want to be treated like a guy? We wouldn't be dealing with this if a guy was doing it."

'And I said, "Well a guy wouldn't be doing this because a guy doesn't sell your show with sex the way that I'm going to." And I'm aware of that. It's a ridiculous conversation and also embarrassing.'
