Amir Khan has hit out at arch rival Kell Brook yet again, accusing his British rival of 'avoiding' a mega-fight as the Bolton fighter turns his attention to Manny Pacquiao. 

Khan and Brook have long failed to see eye to eye, with an all-British showdown mooted for years. However, the two parties have been unable to strike a favourable deal that would see the pair meet in the ring. 

33-year-old Khan signed a three-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing in 2018, with the final bout expected to be against Brook. But Khan instead opted to fight Terence Crawford, where he was stopped in six rounds by the WBO welterweight champion.

The Bolton brawler has long wanted to face Brook (pictured) but a fight has not materialised 

The Olympic silver medallist, who hasn't fought since June 2019, has shed light on why a fight with Brook has not materialised, and his plans for the future.

'At this time we're talking to the likes of Kell Brook, there's Manny Pacquiao,' he told Fight Hub TV. 'My first choice would be Manny Pacquiao, he's such a legend in the sport.

'Kell Brook, obviously he's not going nowhere. He's British. And the thing is, when me and Kell Brook started to negotiate the fight, he then moves up to 154.

'The reason I signed up with Eddie Hearn was to get that Kell Brook fight. The third fight on that contract was probably the Kell Brook fight after the Lo Greco fight and the Vargas fight.

'But then he's gone up to 154 and I found it quite strange because I thought we were gonna fight each other, and that's the reason why I went on and fought Crawford.

'It made people feel like it's me, the one running away from him. But it's not because it's Kell Brook who just avoids the fight.

'He's avoiding it by moving up in weight. By moving up in weight he shows he doesn't want to fight me.'  

Khan last fought over a year ago when he beat Australian Billy Dib in Saudi Arabia with a fourth-round stoppage to win the WBC International welterweight title.
