Indian actor Rudhraksh 'Rudi' Jaiswal has revealed how Chris Hemsworth changed his life after the pair starred in Netflix movie Extraction together.

The 16-year-old told The Daily Telegraph he was bullied at school but the Hollywood star, 37, became his mentor on set and has continued to give him advice.

'Before I did Extraction, my life was very different. I was bullied at school, people would try to bring me down and everyday I would go home crying ,' he said.

The Mumbai-based actor went on to say that Chris stayed in regular contact with him after filming ended.

'He's been guiding me through this journey. If I'm stuck or need advice, I always reach out to him. He's my idol. He always brings out the best in me,' Rudhraksh said.

'He also helped me improve my acting techniques and taught me the art of dialogue, voice modulation and taking pauses in between lines.'

The actors spent six months filming Netflix's Extraction in India and Thailand.

According to the streaming platform, Extraction has been streamed by 'an estimated 90 million households' since its premiere on April 24.

The movie follows SASR operator-turned-mercenary Tyler Rake, played by Chris, as he is recruited to rescue the son of India's biggest drug lord.

The son - played by Rudhraksh - is being held for hefty ransom by a rival drug lord in Bangladesh.  

But when Rake attempts to complete the mission, things start to go terribly awry as corruption and greed come to light.

Extraction is based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, Fernando Leon Gonzalez, and Eric Skillman, as well as Marvel film producers Joe and Anthony Russo, who also produced the film.
