She is set to drop her latest album, Disco, in November.

Wow! Kylie Minogue, 52, looked sensational in a black mini dress and jewelled garter with matching gloves, in snaps shared to her social media accounts on Tuesday

Kylie, who is gearing up to release her 15th studio album, put on an elegantly leggy display in the tiny halter neck frock.

With a light shining behind her, the singer peered through her dishevelled tresses for the sultry snaps.  

Last month, Kylie spoke about what it was like to film the music video clip for her new single Say Something entirely in front of a green screen amid COVID-29 restrictions.   

'It was a different shoot with the restrictions but it felt good to be back on set,' the songstress told The Herald Sun.

Different!: Last month, Kylie revealed what it was like to film her Say Something video clip entirely in front of a green screen amid coronavirus restrictions 

During the clip, Kylie rides a horse statue as a salute to Bianca Jagger, who famously rode a white horse on the Studio 54 dance floor. 

'The horse was the star of the show. I don't think my galactic steed was designed to be ridden, but I fell in love with him, he was gorgeous,' she said. 

She finished: 'I hope when people see it, it takes them to another level and away to wherever their happy place is.'  

This is the 15th studio album for the songstress, who has a global cult following, including in her native Australia and the UK.

The album is said to be a return to form for Kylie, whose last record Golden was a country-inspired effort. 

A source told the The Sun: 'From what I've heard of it so far, the new record is set to be a disco classic.

'It's everything you want from a Kylie album. Fans are going to love it. She has been working on her new music for a while now but everything has really come together in the last few months.'

She's back! Say Something is the first single from Kylie's upcoming album, Disco, due out November 6
