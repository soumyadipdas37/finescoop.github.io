Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny's son, Jett Kenny, has been spotted for the first time since the tragic death of his sister Jaimi.

The 26-year-old model was seen on Queensland's Sunshine Coast getting out of a red Mercedes with surf ski attached to the roof racks.

The former Dancing with the Stars contestant looked downcast but put on a brave face.

Days earlier Jett Kenny had admitted he wasn't always the best brother to Jaimi, who battled an eating disorder for many years.

'I may not have been the best brother to you all the time, I know you thought you weren't being the big sister I needed all the time, but I do know we loved one another unconditionally all the time,' he wrote on his Instagram page on Tuesday.

'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched.'  

Over the past week, the heartbroken brother has sought the comfort of friends, to make it through the harrowing period.

But on Friday, he was seen alone sporting a white baseball cap, navy blue board shorts and a plain white t-shirt with dark sunglasses.

Appearing relaxed in a pair of thongs, the Queensland lifesaver but on a brave face in the wake of his heart-wrenching loss.

On Wednesday, Jett shared footage of himself drinking cocktails and eating pizza with pals on Instagram at a trendy Brisbane restaurant.

One photo shows him smiling as he sits behind a table overlooking the water, while joined by his friend Jamo Porter. 

Also in attendance was Jamo's partner, Karis Ramsay, who uploaded a photo of Jett and Jamo enjoying a lighthearted conversation. 

'Happy anniversary,' Karis wrote next to the image, suggesting that that the purpose of the outing was to celebrate her and Jamo's relationship milestone. 

Sitting in front of Jett and his pal were plates of chips, a burger, several large pizzas and two cold beverages.

On Wednesday evening, Jett hit the gym with a male pal named Jarrad. 

Once again posting to Instagram Stories, he shared a black-and-white video of Jarrad working out his core using a Torsonator device. 

A number of celebrities responded to Jett's post to share their condolences, including Grant Denyer, Erin Holland, Lincoln Lewis and Alicia Banit. 

The Curry-Kenny family confirmed Jaimi's death on Monday afternoon.  

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' said Jaimi's father, Grant.

Heartbreaking: Paying tribute to Jaimi on Instagram on Tuesday, Jett shared a throwback photo of the pair posing for a selfie, alongside a heartbreaking caption

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' he continued.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'

Regrets: The surf lifesaver admitted that he hadn't always 'been the best brother' to Jaimi, who battled an eating disorder for years 

The family's statement did not specify the exact nature of Jaimi's illness.

However, Daily Mail Australia understands she had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic.
