Matt Dillon was seen stepping out for another day on jury duty at the 77th Venice Film Festival on Tuesday - this time with his Italian girlfriend on his arm.

The There's Something About Mary actor, 56, walked arm-in-arm with actress Roberta Mastromichele, 44, as they enjoyed the sunshine of the Italian city.

The pair donned face masks for the walk, before Matt removed his to give cameras and fans a smile and a wave.

He dressed all in black for the occasion - skinny jeans, a V-neck Tee, a blazer and polished loafers.

He added shades to the look, as did Roberta.

She added colour to the couple in the form of a floral-patterned sun dress, with a buttoned front and a terracotta hem.

She ambled along next to Matt in white sandals and clutched a blue purse.

She slung a denim cropped jacket over her bag - but didn't need it in the warm Italian climes.

She wore her brunette tresses loosely around her shoulders and chatted animatedly to Matt, through their PPE. 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It started on Wednesday and ends on the 12 September.

Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis, with temperature checks and mask wearing becoming mandatory. 

Matt joins writer-director Veronika Franz, UK writer-director Joanna Hogg, writer Nicola Lagioia, German filmmaker Christian Petzol and French star Lucivine Sagnier on the Festival's main competition jury, which is presided over by actress Cate Blanchett.

Dillon rose to prominence in the late '80s with roles in films such as the Outsiders and Rumble Fix.

In 2006, he received Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for his critically-acclaimed role in Crash opposite Sandra Bullock.

Since then, he has gone on to star in dozens of films including the gruesome flick The House That Jack built in 2018.
