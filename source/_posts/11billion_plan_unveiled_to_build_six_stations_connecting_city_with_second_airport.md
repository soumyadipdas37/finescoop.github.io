A new 23km metro line connecting Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek to St Marys will stop at six stations along the way.

The driverless railway line includes stations at St Marys, Orchard Hills, Luddenham, the new Western Sydney Aerotropolis and two at Western Sydney Airport.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Sunday said the metro project will deliver 14,000 jobs during construction and will boost western Sydney as a future central business district.

'People from all across greater NSW won't be looking to the eastern part of Sydney for the best jobs, they will be looking right here,' she told reporters.

It's expected construction process for the new multi-billion dollar train line will create 14,000 jobs and then 200,000 jobs through the Aerotropolis over the next 20 years (artist's impression)

Construction for the $11 billion project is slated to start before the end of the year.

NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance said the tender process to deliver 10km of twin metro railway tunnels has started with the government opening the call for registrations of interest.

'This is a city-shaping project we're seeing,' he told reporters.

'The new railway will link residential areas with job hubs, and connect travellers from the new airport with the rest of Sydney's public transport network.'

Western Sydney Minister Stuart Ayres said 200,000 jobs could be created through the Aerotropolis over the next 20 years.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously said the metro line would be complete and operational when the under-construction airport is inaugurated in 2026.

The metro trains would be single-deck and driverless.

Construction of the 24km line is expected to begin by the end of 2020 and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the line would be complete before the Western Sydney Airport
