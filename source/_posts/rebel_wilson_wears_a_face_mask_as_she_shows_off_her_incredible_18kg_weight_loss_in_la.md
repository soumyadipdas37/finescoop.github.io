She's just revealed that she's almost reached her goal weight of 75kg on her health and fitness journey. 

And on Tuesday, Australian actress Rebel Wilson showed off her remarkable weight loss as she stepped out in Los Angeles. 

The 40-year-old Pitch Perfect star, who is believed to have lost a whopping 18kg so far, was spotted heading to an ATM in skintight activewear.

The blonde wore eye-catching blue and white leggings with a black T-shirt. 

She teamed the look with white slip on shoes and black sunglasses, while wearing a face mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Rebel looked relaxed on the outing as she withdrew some cash, clutching an $895 Louis Vuitton wallet.

Last month, Rebel revealed that after months of rigorous dieting and exercise, she's dropped down to 83kg (13 stone, or 183lbs).

The blonde uploaded photos of herself flaunting her slimmed-down figure in a blue wrap dress, explaining in the caption that she's not far off her goal weight of 75kg (11.8 stone, or 165lbs).

'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she wrote in the caption of her post.

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself "hmmmm...better not" and had a bottle of water instead. 

She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'

Rebel has lost an estimated 18kg since the start of the year, after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

'So for me 2020 is going to be called "The Year of Health",' she wrote on Instagram at the time. 

'So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she declared.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'

In May, Rebel revealed she was trying to get down to her goal weight of 75kg.
