It was no fluke, then.

Torquay B&B 'The 25' has been crowned the best in the world in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards – again.

The boutique adults-only inn achieved the coveted accolade in 2019. This year it stands as a winner alongside the likes of Viroth's Hotel in Cambodia, named the 2020 top hotel in the world, three-Michelin-star Auberge Du Vieux Puits in southern France – rated the best fine-dining restaurant on the planet - and Baros Maldives, the top lodge globally for luxury.

Guests at The 25 enjoy rooms with power showers, an Amazon Alexa control system, mood lighting, air conditioning and a heated mist-free bathroom mirror

Andy and Julian - who have been described as 'the perfect hosts' - celebrate their 2020 Tripadvisor gong

Andy Banner-Price, co-owner of The 25, said: 'It's an incredible feeling to be named the best B&B in the world for the second year running. 

'If anything, the second time feels even more special because we know last year's award raised customer expectations and so we've had to work even harder to deliver a great experience for every single one of our guests.

'We didn't rest on our laurels, we've tried to look at every little thing we can do to improve, and it feels like that effort has really paid off with this news today.'

'With so many winning properties coming from the UK this year, it is testament to the high standards of hospitality we enjoy domestically, and that should give Brits the confidence to venture out and support the industry's vital recovery.'
