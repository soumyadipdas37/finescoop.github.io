Eric Dier and Dele Alli were involved in a furious bust-up in the aftermath of Tottenham's defeat to Wolves last season, it has been revealed.

Episode seven of the All or Nothing Amazon Prime documentary on Spurs's 2019/20 season partly focuses on their defeat to the Molineux side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March.

The 3-2 reverse was Spurs' third straight defeat at the time which severely damaged their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.

Spurs led 2-1 at half-time but goals from Diogo Jota and Raul Jimenez consigned them to defeat, and the documentary captures a stroppy Alli after the game.

The England midfielder throws his boots down saying: 'How the f*** did we lose that? F***ing same every single game. Three of the worst goals I've ever seen in my life. Same problem.'

Dier then responds as the heated argument begins, saying: 'Del, why you keep on saying these comments?', to which Alli replies: 'Nothing's changing.'

Dier retorts back saying: 'OK well put a name on them at least yeah? Don't just sit there like a spoilt kid.'

Alli admits the whole team is to blame, including himself, before Dier mocks Alli's initial reaction of throwing his boots.

Dele then instructs Dier to sit there, causing the latter to respond: 'It would be more helpful if you did.'

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho is sat next to Alli as the bust-up unfolds, and at one point puts his arm around the Spurs and England midfielder.

Another coach is sat next to Dier to ensure the situation does not get out of hand, and Mourinho also chips in saying: 'I am happy that you had both these reactions, which is obviously because we lost.

'We lost the game because we couldn't make a foul to stop transitions. 

The goals were all transitions and you have to be nasty, you have to be aggressive, you need to be clever, you need to make the foul.'
