This is the moment a man was buried alive for three minutes under a pile of gravel before finally being dug out by his fellow workers.

The man, from Nairobi, Kenya, was covered when a truck driver tipped the gravel at a construction site unaware he was standing directly behind it.

Colleagues fought tirelessly for three minutes to pull the man from the gravel.

Fortunately, several of his colleagues raced over and started digging him from the pile 

Within three minutes, the man's colleagues were able to exhume him from the gravel 

One man grabbed his legs - which were sticking out the gravel mound - while others used spades to get to him.

Video footage shows the man unconscious after being pulled from the gravel, but came round after first aid treatment and CPR.

Geography teacher Dicken Muchena, 27, who filmed the footage, said: 'This team was transporting the gravel to a construction site when the driver of the tipper lowered the material without knowing that one of them was behind it.

'The victim was buried from the head and for more than three minutes all those around struggled to remove him from the material.

'I was shocked too, but decided to take the video amidst the agony.

'After a while he was removed and we conducted first aid on him. He finally regained his consciousness by God's grace.'

The incident happened on September 15, in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya.
