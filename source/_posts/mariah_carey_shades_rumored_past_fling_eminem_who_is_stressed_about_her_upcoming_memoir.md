Her memoir The Meaning Of Mariah Carey is set to be released on September 29, 2020. 

And weeks before the much anticipated release, Mariah Carey gave a cryptic response when grilled about rumors that Eminem is reportedly 'stressed' over what she said in the book about their rumored fling in 2001.

The Grammy award-winning artist, 50, addressed it, saying: 'There's some songs that I can sing in response to that, but I will not do it,' she told Vulture.

Mariah continued: 'If somebody or something didn't pertain to the actual meaning of Mariah Carey, as in the title, the they aren't in the book.' 

Vulture noted in the story that she said that 'with a roll of her head.' 

Eminem previously referenced the fling in his 2009 song The Warning as well as his 2019 song with Fat Joe called Lord Above, both of which featured crude lyrics about her. 

Her comments come after Us Weekly's sources said in July that Mariah and Eminem (born Marshall Mathers) 'had a very toxic relationship.'

The insider continued: 'Eminem's Achilles heel has always been Mariah Carey. He knows Mariah is going to say very negative things about him. He is expecting the onslaught, and almost welcomes it.'

The source added: 'Marshall is stressed out that Mariah is going to say s**t that he was bad in bed or a selfish lover because he has always been very insecure about that. She knows that.'

In 2002, Eminem seemingly hinted about their romance the prior year on his The Eminem Show album, in songs Superman and When The Music Stops.

At the same time, he said to Rolling Stone about Mariah: 'I don't want to say anything disrespectful because I respect her as a singer, but on the whole personal level, I'm not really feeling it. I just don't like her as a person.'

He added: 'I gotta be honest; I learned a lesson from it: Don't believe the hype. I have respect for her, but she doesn't really have it all together. I'll just say that and that she's a beautiful woman.' 

Following his comments in the 2002 cover story, she denied any relationship and appeared to shade him on her song Clown.

In 2009, Eminem rapped about her then-husband Nick Cannon on a song called Bagpipes From Baghdad, which she responded too with the song Obsessed.

In the video, there was a character that seemingly looked like Eminem.

Eminem then released a song called The Warning the following month, that featured crude lyrics about Mariah. 

Last year, Nick called out Eminem for dissing Mariah in a song he did with Fat Joe, called Lord Above; it also had graphic lyrics about the songstress as well.

The Meaning Of Mariah Carey was written with Michaela Angela Davis and will go on sale September 29.

She teased the memoir for over a year, mentioning it during a Genius Q&A sit-down while promoting her last album, Caution in November 2018.

Mariah said in the interview that she's been thinking about writing one for a decade.

The book is over 300 pages; Fans can pre-order already so they make sure they get a copy from the first print. The book is being published under Andy Cohen's Imprint.

 In July, Mariah shared a peek at the back cover, which features a letter from the star herself to her fans.

The legendary singer also included a countdown on her stories with the back cover, but did not reveal if it is a countdown for its release or for a view of the front of the book. 

The five-time Grammy Award winning singer, who is one of the best selling music artists of all time, captioned the back cover/letter with: 'Delivered! "I have learned that beauty has to flourish in the light."'

The quote she included in the caption is actually a lyric from her 1997 hit song Butterfly, which is co-wrote and co-produced with Walter Afanasieff.

On the back of the book, Mariah wrote: 'It took me a lifetime to have the courage and the clarity to write my memoir. I want to tell the story of the moments - the ups and downs, the triumphs and traumas, the debacles and the dreams, that contributed to the person I am today.'

The mother of two continued: 'Though there have been countless stories about me throughout my career and very public personal life, it's been impossible to communicate the complexities and depths of my experience in any single magazine article or a ten-minute television interview.' 

Adding: 'And even then, my words were filtered through someone else's lens, largely satisfying someone else's assignment to define me.'

Mariah, who has sold over 200 million records worldwide, said: 'This book is composed of my memories, my mishaps, my struggles, my survival and my songs. Unfiltered. I went deep into my childhood and gave the scared little girl inside of me a big voice. I let the abandoned and ambitious adolescent have her say, and the betrayed woman I became tell her side.'

She said that 'writing this memoir was incredibly hard, humbling and healing. My sincere hope is that you are moved to a new understanding, not only about me, but also about the resilience of the human spirit.'
