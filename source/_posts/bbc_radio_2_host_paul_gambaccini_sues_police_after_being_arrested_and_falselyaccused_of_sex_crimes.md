A BBC Radio 2 host is suing Scotland Yard for £150,000 after he was arrested and falsely accused of sexual abuse under Operation Yewtree 
Paul Gambaccini, 71, said the allegations caused a 'catastrophic effect on all aspects' of his life 
Mr Gambaccini was accused of molesting two young men - whom he does not recall meeting - in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
Paul Gambaccini, 71, said the allegations caused a 'catastrophic effect on all aspects' of his life
He was arrested as part of the Operation Yewtree inquiry, which was set up after the Jimmy Savile scandal   
While the Met Police did not name him as a suspect, they referred to his age and his home's location which it is claimed contributed to him being identified  
Court papers state Mr Gambaccini is 'extremely distressed and upset' to have been publicly suspect of sexual abuse and that some of his friends, collagues and contacts - including several high-profile celebrities - shunned him, The Mirror reported 
He was arrested in October 2013 and spent a year on bail before the case was dropped

Paul Gambaccini, Daniel Janner and Sir Cliff Richard are pictured at an event in Westminster in July last year to launch a campaign for a ban on naming sexual crime suspects unless they are charged 
Operation Yewtree was an investigation beginning October 2, 2012, into sexual abuse allegations
It focused on allegations made against the disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile and others 
Many investigations under Operation Yewtree were for child sex abuse crimes, but others were against women 
As a result of Operation Yewtree, 11 criminal legal cases were brought and seven of those led to convictions 
The operation closed on November 17, 2017  
Operation Winter Key is the force's 'overarching' investigation into child sex allegations against 'persons of public prominence' and institutions such as care homes, costing £20million as of February this year 
This £20m figure includes the £15m spent on Operation Yewtree 
Several famous names were subject of sex crime investigations under the Operation Yewtree investigation 
Some have been tried and convicted, while others were acquitted or have been subject of no further action 
Those convicted included publicist Max Clifford, entertainer Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and singer Gary Glitter
They are among high-profile figures unconnected to Savile to be convicted for sex crimes under the operation
Clifford was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on four girls and women aged between 15 and 19 in March 2014 
Harris was found guilty of multiple sex attacks on young girls in 2014 
On 23 September 2014, Travis was found guilty of indecently assaulting a female researcher 
On 5 February 2015, Glitter was convicted of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one of having sex with a girl under the age of 13 
The court papers said that the arrest affected his career after he was suspended by the BBC and not invited back to the Music Industry Trusts Awards Dinner 
He had hosted the event annually since 1997 and he was also dropped by charities Stonewall, the LGBT charity, and Amnesty International, the papers claimed 
The papers add that Mr Gambacinni is seeking 'damages over £100,000 but not exceeding £150,000' 
He said in November last year that The Met's public comments were ‘in breach of the Met Police’s own media guidelines’ and his legal right to a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights 
In a defence document, The Met, represented by Anne Studd QC, denied the information released amounted to private information 
In 2018, he received a five-figure sum in damages and a full apology from the Crown Prosecution Service over the same botched sex abuse inquiry
As revealed by the Daily Mail in November 2018, the CPS had wrongly suggested his accusers had been underage when he was formally cleared of any wrong-doing It also suggested there was ‘insufficient evidence’ in the case – whereas his lawyers insisted the claims should never have been taken seriously in the first place 
Despite this, police kept him on bail for a year before prosecutors announced in October 2014 that there would be no charges By then, he had lost an estimated £200,000 in income and costs 
Operation Yewtree was an investigation beginning on October 2, 2012, into sexual abuse allegations, predominantly against children 
The investigation focused on allegations made against British media personality Jimmy Savile, but also investigated others, including Paul Gambuccini 
Seven people were convicted after 11 criminal legal cases were brought and the operation closed on November 17, 2017
