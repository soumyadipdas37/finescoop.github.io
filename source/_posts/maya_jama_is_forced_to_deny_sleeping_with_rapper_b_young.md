Maya Jama was forced to deny being intimate with rapper B Young, (Bertan Jafer), on Twitter on Wednesday. 

It all started off when someone incorrectly wrote that Maya, 26, was 'mackin B Young' slang for intensely making out with someone. 

She clapped back with: 'I heard your mum was playing his song yday, she must be mackin too.' 

Standing up for herself: Maya Jama has been forced to deny sleeping with rapper B Young as she sarcastically tweeted on Wednesday: 'I cannot listen to a male artist without sh***ing him'

The man in question: Bertan Jafer, B Young, is a British rapper and singer-songwriter from Hackney, London, (pictured in 2018) 

Another person then waded in and wrote: '1000001 I love @mayajama. Being a woman in the music industry is hard work.' 

British television and radio presenter Maya then wrote: 'Loool update! Ladies we can not listen to a male artist without sh***ing him.' 

Just the day before, Maya, who dated musician Stormzy for four years until their split in August 2019, was forced to deny she had coupled up with Love Island's Wes Nelson. 

That's RIGHT! Maya clapped back at someone who accused of her being intimate with the music star, in the best possible way 

She hit back at trolls on Twitter after pictures of them together appeared on social media.  

One follower wrote: 'Maya Jama is a prime example of you can’t have boys mates without instantly everyone thinking you’re s***ging.'

Maya wrote back: 'Oh honey it’s been this way. 

Moving swiftly on: Maya proved she was not letting things get her down as she took to Instagram Stories wearing a busty corset top as she tucked into a wrap 

Former flame: Maya famously dated musician Stormzy for four years until their split in August 2019 (pictured together in 2017) 

'This is after he was on my team for a TV show but I've learnt even if I stood there with a sign on my head saying PRESENTER AT WORK if I’m next to a man people will act like I linked him down the road for a snog.'

She added: 'It is a bit f***** when I think about it.

'I'll be doing my job minding my business, and next thing you know I’m on a blog with a 12-year-old debating how many men I’ve been with from selfies they’ve seen.'

But Maya was busy getting on with her life on Instagram Stories on Wednesday as she put on a busty display in a monochrome bustier while in the make-up chair. 

She wrote: 'Show ready' while tucking into a wrap while dancing to Mis-Teeq's Garage anthem All I Want.  

Oh, give the girl a break! The day before, Maya was forced to deny she had coupled up with Love Island's Wes Nelson, (pictured)
