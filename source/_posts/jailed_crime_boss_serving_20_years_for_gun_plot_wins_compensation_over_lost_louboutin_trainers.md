A jailed crime boss serving 20 years for a machine gun trafficking plot has been awarded compensation after his designer shoes got lost in the the post.

Miekeil Dixon-Nash's £1,500 blue Christian Louboutin were lost when they were posted to him while he was serving time at HMP Swaleside in Kent.

A pair of golden Nike Air Max 97 trainers were also lost after they were posted to the prison.

The gangster, 30, claimed more than £4,500 in loses - which included the price of the £1,500 trainers, as well as for the time he was 'deprived' of wearing the shoes, The Sun reports.

Hearing the case, judge Caroline Wilkinson, at Central London County Court, accepted he owned the trainers and they were sent in.

But she awarded Dixon-Nash £144 for the Louboutins and £95 for the Nikes - because he could not prove they were new.

According to the Sun, which reports that the case may have cost taxpayers thousands of pounds, the judge said: 'I accept that he did own a pair of Christian Louboutin trainers and that he owned these trainers at the time they were sent into the prison. Unfortunately [they were] not returned to him.

'He is therefore liable to be compensated for the loss of value to him of those trainers.' 

Dixon-Nash was jailed along with his mother Claudette Dixon, 47, for a total of 34 years in 2018.

The pair and a 17-year-old boy were arrested following a shoot out in north London a year earlier. 

Detectives investigating the shoot-out found a Colt 45, which was used in the incident and was linked to Dixon-Nash and the boy.

The boy's DNA was then found on a Mac 10 submachine gun in Dixon’s house, in Waltham Cross, Herts.

CCTV captured Dixon-Nash present at the fight and the 17-year-old picking up evidence afterwards. 

Phone evidence revealed Dixon-Nash and the 17-year-old arranging a pistol linked to the shootings to be handed over to an associate — which was captured on CCTV.

All three denied conspiracy to supply firearms but were convicted at Wood Green Crown Court.

Dixon-Nash was jailed for 20 years, Dixon for 14 years, and the 17-year-old was sentenced to eight years in a young offenders’ institute.
