Adding some glamorous touches, the TV star opted for a gold necklace, white platform trainers and a black CELINE handbag. 

Maya left her brunette locks loose and added a slick of glamorous make-up which included red lipstick.

The star took cautious measures amid the coronavirus pandemic and donned a black face mask for her journey home.

Maya had been visiting the Treehouse Hotel London to shoot a new exciting advert for mijmasks which she shared details of to her Instagram Story.

Although the star kept the majority of details under wraps while the mijmasks Instagram gives nothing away other than 'coming soon'. 

The outing comes as Maya recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.

The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  

Speaking during a Q&A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it's like, 'This is this, it's everybody's business'.'

Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heady Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  

He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. 

'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire.'

Maya has since been linked to Drake, who reportedly first contacted the TV star in 2018, but she ignored his messages as she was still dating Stormzy at the time.

The God's Plan hitmaker, 33, even provoked Maya's ex Stormzy in a song where he refers to the TV presenter as a 'sweet one'.

A source said: 'Drake definitely appeared to have a soft spot for Maya and late in 2018 he started following her on Instagram out of the blue. She totally ignored him and didn't follow him back as she was with Stormzy.

'Even when she split with Stormzy it's not something Maya wanted to pursue and she has left it.'  

Drake's jibe on rapper Headie One's track Only You Freestyle comes after Stormzy declared that he still 'wholeheartedly' loves Maya earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Stormzy's new romance with Victoria's Secret model Yasmine Holmgren is going from strength-to-strength as it was revealed last month that the pair enjoyed a secret reunion in London once lockdown ended.
