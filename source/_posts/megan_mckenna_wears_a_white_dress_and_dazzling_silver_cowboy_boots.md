She's preparing to celebrate her 28th birthday on Saturday.

And Megan McKenna put on a stylish display as she posed with balloons for fun snaps that she shared via Instagram on Friday.

The former TOWIE star, 27, looked sensational in a short-sleeved white dress that showed off her slender legs as she relaxed on the grass.

Wow! Megan McKenna looked stylish in a chic white dress and dazzling silver cowboy boots ahead of her 27th birthday in snaps she shared via Instagram on Friday

Megan added a glittering touch to her look by wearing a pair of black cowboy boots that were adorned with silver sequins.

Adding to her country music vibe, Megan covered her blonde locks with a brown cowboy hat while she accessorised with a silver necklace. 

The X Factor: Celebrity star gushed about her milestone birthday, as she said in the caption: 'Happiest when I’m in my crystal cowboy boots...

'It’s my birthday TOMORROW And anybody that purchases one of my bouncy blows with @easilockshair gets a present from ME. Birthday weeks are the best weeks.'

Last month, it was reported that Megan is 'smitten' with her new businessman beau Josh Riley after he won her heart over during a series of fancy dinner dates. 

Josh is said to have wined and dined the reality star as they enjoyed a date at the swanky Mayfair restaurant Hakkasan, where they originally met earlier this year.  

He is the company director of the online men's fashion brand, Yelir World, which has been featured in GQ and has been worn by Wayne Rooney. 

A source confirmed to The Sun that the pair are now an item and are planning their future together.  

The source revealed: 'Megan and Josh have been dating for a few months. They’re totally smitten, it’s very sweet to see.

'The pair of them are taking it slow but they have been talking about the future.'
