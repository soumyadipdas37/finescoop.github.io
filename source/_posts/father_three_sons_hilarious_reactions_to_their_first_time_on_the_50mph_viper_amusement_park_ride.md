A father from Illinois has recorded the reactions of three of his sons as they tried their very first rollercoasters.

Brian Prunty, who lives in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, has filmed three hilarious videos of his sons Mason, Tyson and Jack each trying the Viper ride at the Six Flags Great America Parkway, Gurnee, Lake County.

The videos were all taken in different years but each hilariously capture the boys' reactions as they try out the 50mph ride.

Brian Prunty filmed three hilarious videos of three of his sons Mason, Tyson and Jack each trying the Viper rollercoaster at the Six Flags Great America Parkway, Gurnee, Lake County

Eldest of the boys Mason (pictured) handles his first ever rollercoaster ride well as he grins most of the way round

All three of the boys' reactions are played simultaneously to compare how they enjoyed the ride.

The earliest video is of Mason when he was eight in 2016, Tyson was filmed at the age of six in 2017 and Jack was six in 2019. 

Mason seems to handle the ride the best out of the boys as he is seen smiling and looking around throughout the ride, even saying at the end: 'I found the best way to do it. Do it like this, hold on!'

Tyson starts his clip by making faces at the camera while the rollercoaster begins its climb, but once the ride speeds up he begins switching between screaming and clenching his teeth in terror.

Jack, who was the youngest when he tried the Viper, clings onto father Brian's arm as the ride goes round.

Tyson (pictured) was the next boy to try the ride but he didn't handle it as well as Mason and alternated between screaming and clenching his teeth in terror

Youngest boy Jack (pictured) wrapped himself tightly around his father's arm as the ride went round and when asked if he wanted another go, replied firmly: 'No'

When asked at the end of the ride if he wanted to go on again, Jack replies confidently: 'No.' 

Speaking about the videos, Brian said: 'All of these are the same ride, different years on The Viper at six flags in Chicago.

'They have been on rides since, even Tyson likes rollercoasters and has even been on this one again since.

'Unfortunately, it was closed this summer so Jack hasn't had a chance to redeem himself yet.

'We also have two other boys, the oldest son who I wish I had a video of his first ride and a 5-year-old who I will hopefully add to this video in a couple of years.'
