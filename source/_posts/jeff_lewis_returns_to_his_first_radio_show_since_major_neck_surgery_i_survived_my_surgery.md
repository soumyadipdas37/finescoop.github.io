Jeff Lewis underwent surgery last Wednesday after being diagnosed with the spinal cord disease Cervical Myelopathy, just two weeks prior. 

The 50-year-old Flipping Out alum returned to his first radio show since the procedure. 

'First of all, I survived my surgery,' the the interior designer-house flipper revealed on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live. 'I still have my legs and I can walk, although I did use the walker on the first day.' 

Recovering: Jeff Lewis returned to his first radio show since undergoing major surgery last Wednesday, after being diagnosed with the spinal cord disease Cervical Myelopathy just two weeks prior 

Lewis sought help from a doctor after experiencing lower back and neck pain and instability in his legs.

The former Brave star also joked to his radio show cohosts, Megan Weaver and Doug Budin, their listeners overprepared him for the major surgery. 

While he initially purchased an additional walker to have one on 'each floor' of his home, Lewis says he was walking on his own again 'by day two.' 

In addition, he ceased the opportunity to thank fans that shared their experiences undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).

Following his spine surgery, he praised the suggestion of a zero gravity chair and warnings to expect sleepless nights.   

Despite still navigating his pain, Lewis opted to look at the positive, telling Weaver and Budin he lost 'six and a half pounds and gained a quarter inch in height because of the implant.'  

'Do I look taller?' he quipped, before detailing his preparation for surgery and discovering he woke up saying a 'lot of inappropriate things.' 

Exes: Lewis and Edwards welcomed Monroe in 2016 via surrogate before splitting in early 2019, after a decade together 

According to the star, the physician's assistant, named Hannah, told his assistant Shane Douglas and ex Shane Anderson he was 'saying a lot of crazy things.'  

Unable to recount his specific conversations, the only thing Lewis could definitively remember was 'mentioning the word penis' and probably saying 'I'd still have sex with you anyway.'  

As his costars teased that they 'hope Hannah does not file a claim' because he 'could've sexually accosted her,' the father-of-one vocally cringed at the endless possibilities of what could've escaped his mouth.  

Second thoughts: Lewis confessed earlier this month on Andy Cohen's radio show that he had 'had feelings for [his ex Gage Edward] and I feel like I have regret...' but that nasty messages changed his feelings; shown in June 2018

'I'm so worried about the things I might've said because I was really messed up,' he confessed. 

He crassly added: 'There's a humongous bruise, you can see it, it's huge and ugly on my bicep. And I'm wondering, did they have to restrain me? So I don't know what happened, I could've been sexually assaulted.' 

In the final minutes of the segment, he also revealed he scaled back on his pain killers and muscle relaxers to return to the air.  

Dig: While recovering Lewis took a dig at his ex Gage Edwards, sharing a photoshopped image of Edwards unplugging a hospital machine as Lewis laid in bed

'I knew to start radio, I would probably need to kind of pair back, so yesterday I went from four pain pills to two pain pills a day,' he concluded. 'I went from three muscle relaxers to two. I feel good, but not too loopy loopy.' 

Last week while recovering from the neck surgery, the radio host took a shot at his ex by sharing an edited meme image, showing his face photoshopped over a hospital patient.

His ex Edwards was edited to be standing over him declaring 'It's Monroe Edwards now b***h,' referring to their three-year-old daughter. 

No thanks: The couple has since been in a bitter custody battle over their daughter since splitting

Edwards then unplugged the chord connected to hospital equipment. 'Thanks for all of the support,' Lewis captioned the photo.
