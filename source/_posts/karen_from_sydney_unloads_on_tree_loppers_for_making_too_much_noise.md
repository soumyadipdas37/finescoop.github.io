Disturbing footage has emerged showing a woman unleashing on a group of landscapers for parking their 'heavy machinery' out the front of her house

She begins by threatening to call the police because she says she 'cannot deal with this noise'. 'Move the 'f***king truck somewhere else,' she yells

One of the men then tells the woman an email was sent out about the work they had been paid to do. 

The woman responds saying the email never mentioned the 'piece of heavy machinery' being parked in front of her house. 

The tree lopper asks where he should park the machinery instead. 

'I don't give a s***,' she shouts back.  

The woman then starts screaming: 'I don't give a s***, I just don't give a s***... F***ing move. 

'If you don't move I will call the police. Do you understand?

'This is my house, I live here. How do you suggest that I deal with hours of noise. '

He responds saying they have permission to park at the front of her house. 

She tells them again that the email never mentioned the machinery. 

Another woman can be seen trying to pull the hysterical woman away but she refuses to move and continues to scream abuse at the men, telling them to move the machinery to her neighbour's place instead. 

The woman erupts at one of the workers, calling them a 'f***ing a**hole'. 'I have to work today,' she yells

The workers tell her if they moved the truck it would be blocking the trees. 

'How are we going to do the job without the machine?' one of the men asks. 

They then ask if they can block her driveway and she agrees. 

'Sure block my driveway, we're not going to use my car.'

The men then question what difference it would make whether they park at the front of her house or in her driveway. 

She tells them she 'can't deal with the noise for hours'. 

The woman then suddenly erupts again, screaming and pointing at another person.

'I have to work today,' she yells. 

She then threatens to call the police once more, before the fed-up workers e

 And the workers tell her to do it. 

The video has been captioned: 'Karen from Sydney is angry and has a go at tree loppers working next door'.
