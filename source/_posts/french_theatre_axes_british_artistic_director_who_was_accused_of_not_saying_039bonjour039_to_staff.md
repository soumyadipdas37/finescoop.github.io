The British boss of a prestigious French theatre has lost her job after being accused of failing to say &lsquo;Bonjour&rsquo; to staff.
Three years ago, Ruth Mackenzie, the artistic director at France&rsquo;s Theatre du Chatelet, became the first woman to head the Paris institution &ndash; but her contract was abruptly terminated on Friday.
Describing her &lsquo;unbelievably brutal&rsquo; exit, the 63-year-old said &lsquo;A letter was sent to my lawyer terminating my contract and telling me I was to vacate my office, my email was being cut off and my salary stopped.
&lsquo;There was a complaint about my management style oppressing a couple of junior members of the marketing team, but they got the union involved so an independent inquiry was carried out.

&#039;The inquiry produced a 56-page report which explicitly stated that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing.&rsquo;
Ms Mackenzie, who was in charge of the official cultural programme for the 2012 London Olympics, for which she was appointed a CBE, added &lsquo;There were a few points raised, for example that I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Bonjour&rdquo; to people every day, that my French is not good enough and that I didn&rsquo;t attend a staff ceremony to turn on the Christmas lights, but nothing constituting a sackable offence.

&lsquo;It recommended mediation and workshops, which, of course, I accepted.&rsquo;
The theatre declined to comment on her departure but a source told French media that there had been a &lsquo;managerial and financial problem&rsquo; related to Ms Mackenzie&rsquo;s first season at the theatre and opera house.
The Theatre du Chatelet, which dates back to 1862, was closed for two years from 2017 for a &pound;28.6 million restoration and reopened last September but it has been forced to close since then by the Covid-19 pandemic.
