LeToya was part of Destiny's Child with Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Roberson, a group formed by Beyonce's dad Matthew Knowles in 1993.

After the group's first two albums were released and they started to enjoy success, LeToya and LaTavia had a falling out with Knowles and had sought their own representation.

But in the midst of the group's rise to stardom in 2000, Le Toya and LaTavia were fired and replaced by Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. 

They filed lawsuits against Mathew Knowles, Beyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland, charging them with breach of partnership, among other claims. They eventually dropped their case against Beyonce and Kelly, and settled their case out against Mathew out of court.

Luckett went on to enjoy success as a solo artist, releasing the studio albums between 2006 and 2017.
