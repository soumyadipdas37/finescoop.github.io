Qantas have planned a scenic joyride flight over several popular Australian tourists sites in a unique way to avoid lockdown border controls.

The Australian airline launched The Great Southern Land flight which is scheduled to leave from and return to Sydney Domestic Airport on October 10.

The boomerang flight will include low-level flybys over tourist destinations including the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru, Kata Tjuta, Byron Bay and Sydney Harbour.

Up to 150 travellers can fit on the flight, with an economy seat costing $787. 

Customers wishing to fly premium economy will pay $1,787 a ticket, while those flying business class will be charged $3,787.

The airline said the trip is in response to strong demand from frequent flyers who miss the flying experience and to promote key Australian tourist attractions.

'While we may not be able to take you overseas right now, we can certainly provide inspiration for future trips to some of Australia's most beautiful destinations,' Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said.

Take off will be at 10.30am, with the flight heading north over New South Wales into Queensland before turning west to the Northern Territory then returning for sunset over Bondi Beach.

The seven hour journey will be on a Boeing 787-9 painted with Indigenous livery, which has the biggest windows on any passenger aircraft.

Passengers will eat from a food menu designed by Neil Perry with live entertainment from a celebrity MC and be given Qantas pyjamas, a gift bag and the chance to buy Boeing 747 memorabilia after the aircraft was recently retired from Qantas' fleet. 

No passport or quarantine is required for the journey, though Qantas strongly recommend all passengers wear a face mask while onboard the flight. 

'Australia is a great land and home to unique wonders like Uluru and the Whitsundays, so we know that it will be truly special to experience this beautiful country from the comfort and freedom of the sky,' Mr Joyce said.

'This flight, and possibly more like it, means work for our people, who are more enthusiastic than anyone to see aircraft back in the sky.'

The Great Southern Land flight will go on sale at midday on Thursday.
