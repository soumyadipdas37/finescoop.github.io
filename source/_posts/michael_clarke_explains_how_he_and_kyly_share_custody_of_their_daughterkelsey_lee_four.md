Michael Clarke has spoken out on his relationship with ex wife Kyly Clarke after the couple's split in February. 

The former cricketer tells this week's Stellar that he has a 'great relationship' with his former wife of seven years. 

The 39-year-old says that the focus for both he and Kyly is their daughter, Kelsey Lee, four, and the pair have come to an amicable custody arrangement without involving the courts.

'I can sit here and say my daughter is the most important thing in my world. I've got a wonderful relationship and friendship with Kyly,' he told the magazine. 

Michael explained that the former couple share custody fifty-fifty, each spending three days a piece with the toddler. 

'At the moment we do three nights on, three nights off – that's our routine. Kyly and I talk daily to work out if that is best for Kelsey Lee,' he added.

Michael admits that being a single father has it's challenges, however. 

'We always talk about single mothers; the challenges they face. But the single father faces challenges as well. 

'There are things about Kelsey Lee that I learn every day. If I don't see her for three nights, I feel like my girl has turned six... As a parent, I'm absolutely no different to any other father,' he added.   

The interview comes after Kyly and Michael announced their $40million divorce after seven years of marriage.

The Clarkes, who were high-school sweethearts, have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee.

Michael and Kyly have reportedly already agreed terms on their divorce - as well as arrangements to co-parent their daughter - without going through the courts. 

After months of speculation, Michael went public with his romance with fashion designer Pip Edwards in July.

The pair enjoyed a vacation in Noosa with Pip, 40, and their children from previous relationships, Kelsey Lee Clarke and 13-year-old Justice Single.

The couple documented their trip on Instagram, marking the first time they have publicly acknowledged their relationship.

They began dating after Michael's split from Kyly last year, but their romance didn't make headlines until February, when the Clarkes publicly announced their separation.
