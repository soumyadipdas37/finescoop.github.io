title: NOAA satellites show 45,000-FEET fire cloud in California forest 
description: A wildfire blazing through Californias Sierra National Forest created a massive fire cloud visible from space. The pyrocumulonimbus cloud grew 45,000ft from intense heat and moisture.

California is being plagued by 'life threatening temperatures' and out of control wildfires, with flames scorching more than two million acres since August.

The 'Creek Fire' ignited on Friday in Sierra National Forest, which burned more than 78,000 acres and produces a massive 'fire cloud' visible from space.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites captured the gigantic pyrocumulonimbus cloud that towered an estimated 45,000 feet high above the region.

The phenomenon formed from intense heat released by the flames that mixed with moisture in the atmosphere, resulting in the massive cloud that also produced thunderstorms.

Fire Departments across California have battled more than 900 wildfires since August 15, many of which have been spurred by record-breaking temperatures and other freak weather conditions, including concentrations of thousands of lightning strikes in a number of different areas.

Five new fires were identified just over the weekend that have burned more than 100,000 acres in just a few days.

In Northern California, rescuers in military helicopters airlifted 207 people to safety over the weekend after an explosive wildfire trapped them in a popular camping area in Sierra National Forest that has burned since Friday afternoon.

The flames in the park have scorched more than 75,000 acres and created fire tornadoes and intense thunderstorms, Space.com reported.

'@NOAA's #GOES17 has been monitoring California's #CreekFire, which grew explosively today after igniting in the Sierra National Forest on Friday,' NOAA's public affairs office wrote on Twitter on Sunday, September 6.

'In this loop, you can see the fire's extraordinary #Pyrocumulonimbus cloud, which reached an estimated 45,000+ ft [14,000 meters, or about 8.5 miles] high.'

Experts have compared these clouds to large chimneys that send large amounts of smoke into the lower stratosphere.

When smoke does reach the stratosphere, it tends to spread globally and remain high in the atmosphere for longer periods—months or even years—than smoke that stays in the lower troposphere.

And it can also send tons of pollutants into the atmosphere.

Dr. Glenn K. Yue, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Langley Research Center, said: 'n individual pyroCb can inject particles into the lower stratosphere as high as 10 miles.'

Some homes surrounding Sierra National Forest have been burned to the ground, but officials have yet to confirm the amount of damage. Officials said at least 2,000 structures were threatened in the surrounding 290 miles of the blaze. 

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

'The lake is totally engulfed with smoke. You can't hardly see in front of you,' area resident Jack Machado said. 'The sky's turning red. It looks like Mars out there.'
