Rennes' tried in vain to have Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud included in the deal for Edouard Mendy, according to reports in France.

The Senegal goalkeeper is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer of spending for Chelsea after Sportsmail revealed at the weekend they had agreed a £25million fee with the Ligue 1 side.

But while details are now close to being finalised, at the start of the negotiations Rennes' demands were reportedly completely different and included France World Cup winner Giroud.

According to French outlet L'Equipe, the Ligue 1 side had demanded a £37m (€40m) fee for Mendy along with the option of signing the 33-year-old former Arsenal striker on loan for no charge at all.

However, that appears to have been rejected by the Blues who have now come to an agreement with their French counterparts on a £25m for the 28-year-old goalkeeper, whose contract at Rennes ran until 2023.

Mendy was left out of Rennes' 4-2 victory against Nimes on Sunday and now looks set to provide immediate competition for under-fire Kepa Arrizabalaga and Willy Caballero. 

Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and manager Frank Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record.

And the Chelsea boss may already been vindicated in his decision to sign Mendy after Spaniard Kepa made another blunder in their 2-1 win at Brighton. 

Leandro Trossard made it 1-1 when his long-range left-footed strike flew underneath the body of the 25-year-old on Monday evening, which according to Squawka was the 19th Premier League goal scored outside the box he has conceded since arriving in England.

However, despite admitting after the game he remains happy with Kepa, Lampard appears close to signing Mendy in a bid to solve the club's goalkeeper issues. 

The previous record fee for a goalkeeper moving from France to England was the £12.3m Chelsea paid to Rennes in 2004 for Petr Cech, who is now Chelsea's technical director and played a key role in Mendy's selection.
