Things appear to be getting serious between Kyle Sandilands, 49, and his new girlfriend Tegan Kynaston, 34.

The couple, who confirmed their relationship in January, have reportedly moved in together in Sydney.

According to The Daily Telegraph, Kyle and Tegan are settling into the KIIS FM host's multimillion-dollar mansion in Woollahra.

The home, which Kyle is renting, is just a 10-minute drive from Sydney's CBD.

The property is also located within a short distance from Kyle's radio co-host Jackie O Henderson's $11 million mansion.

 Kyle began dating personal assistant Tegan, following his split from his long-term girlfriend Imogen Anthony.

The radio titan announced his shock split from his girlfriend-of-eight-years on The Kyle and Jackie O Show in November last year.

He told listeners the couple 'haven't been living with each other' for months and their relationship had simply 'run its course'.

'We haven't been with each other for quite a few months now. Unfortunately it's run its course,' he said.

Tegan is the director of communications for Sandilands' company, King Kyle Pty Ltd, and was previously the radio star's personal assistant.

The couple went public with their romance on New Year's Eve, when Tegan shared a picture of herself kissing Kyle on the cheek in front of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. 

Two months earlier, she had denied rumours she was dating her employer.
