As well as his milestone birthday, the album - his 46th studio album - will also mark six decades since the star shot to fame with his debut album, Cliff Sings, in 1959.

The 12 track album will feature two new songs 'Falling For You' and 'PS Please' as well as new interpretations of songs originally by Sir Cliff's favourite artists including The Beatles' 'Here Comes The Sun' and The Bee Gees' 'Too Much Heaven'. 

The legend also collaborates with  Bonnie Tyler, The Bellamy Brothers, Sheila Walsh, The Piano Guys and Albert Hammond on the track that inspired the album title The Air That I Breathe.

Sir Cliff said: 'Looking back, I remember thinking that I wouldn't make it to 50 and here I am at 80, and what's even better than that is I have a new album!

'Music... The Air That I Breathe' which features, not just me, but friends I admire who duetted with me on some of the tracks. 

'I loved recording it and hope you will enjoy listening to it.'

Along with Sir Cliff's brand-new album, his new book 'The Dreamer: An Autobiography' is to be published on October 29.

The star recently teased his new calendar, his 42nd released in his career.     

In recent years he has outsold all of his younger rivals except One Direction.   

New chapter: In November 2018, Richard unveiled his album Rise Up, which was the first time he had released new music in 14 years and it reached number four in the UK charts

In 2013, he sparked an outcry from fans when he hinted he was set to end his calendar boy days.

He said: 'I think the reason why the rumours got out that I'm not going to do any more is probably because it's true. No, not completely. You have hit the nail on the head – how many shapes can I pull with this body?' 

The star is the third best-selling artist in the UK singles history with Elvis Presley in first place and the Beatles in second, with record sales of 250million worldwide.

In April, Cliff accused radio stations of snubbing his music for younger stars.

The singing legend, who has been in the industry more than 60-years, has demanded that he should be given a 'priority chance' due to his long career. 

He said that without radio support he is forced to go on tour but this is proving difficult as his 'long-term fans' are dying.  

The star has asked that his songs be played more regularly so younger listeners can discover him.

 Richard told the Greatest Music of All Time podcast: 'Why will people download a record of mine if they don't know it's out?'  

He added: 'Those of us who have proven ourselves over and over and over again should be given a priority chance [on radio], even if it's to say 'We are going to play this record once a day for two weeks'.

'Without radio, there is nothing we can do other than go on tour, which is not only tiring, it gets less efficient as time goes by, the audiences get smaller. We are all dying. Long-term fans may not be with us any more.'

In November 2018, Richard unveiled his album Rise Up, which was the first time he had released new music in 14 years and it reached number four in the UK charts.
