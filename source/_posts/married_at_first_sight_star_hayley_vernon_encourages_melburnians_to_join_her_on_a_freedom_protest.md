Former Married At First Sight star Hayley Vernon has encouraged her social media followers to join her on a walk to 'protest the freedom of Victorians'.

The coronavirus conspiracy theorist passionately spruiked the upcoming event in a series of screenshots shared to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday.

The 33-year-old Melburnian also poked fun at those complying with the state's orders to wear a mask in public and appeared to ridicule the 'unprecedented times' brought on by the virus by boasting about her 'health and fitness.'

Speaking in a short clip as she rode her bike maskless, Hayley said: 'We have a lot going on right now. One thing that I'm mega thankful for is my health and fitness.

'Without my health and fitness, I don't know where I would stand mentally during these unprecedented times,' she added with a laugh at the end.

Hayley also advised her followers to join in on a 'Freedom Day' protest, which is scheduled to take part in Melbourne, as well as Australia's other states.

'I'm calling on all activists, SJW's [social justice warriors], BLM protestors, pro life choices, concerned Victorians, anyone! Join the walk in protesting our freedom,' she wrote.

Hayley also shared a short clip from Toy Story where its character Buzz Lightyear dramatically falls to the ground while Woody watches on .

The scene was titled: 'People in public when their mask falls off.'

Hayley - who joined the explicit adult streaming site OnlyFans last month - has been regularly accused of spreading misleading and false information about COVID-19 since it was declared a pandemic in March.

In July, she criticised Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for making face masks mandatory in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.

She said: 'Without my health and fitness, I don't know where I would stand mentally during these unprecedented times'

'Why are we wearing masks? Us people who are healthy,' she wrote on Instagram. 'This as you said "is about curbing behaviour". I'll be dammed if you are going to curb anything about me.'

She continued: 'You are a walking talking oxymoron. I am woke. I will not be wearing a mask. MELBOURNE AND AUSTRALIANS STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS. This is not the time to comply.'

Victoria recorded 70 new cases overnight, down from a peak of more than 700 cases in July when the state's second wave began.

Hayley rose to fame on the 2020 season of Married At First Sight where she was 'married' to David Cannon.

She had tumultuous relationship with David, who infamously used her toothbrush to clean a dirty toilet.   

Before her controversial stint on the Channel Nine experiment, Hayley worked in a lucrative finance role but has been earning her living working as a construction labourer since her return to Melbourne.
