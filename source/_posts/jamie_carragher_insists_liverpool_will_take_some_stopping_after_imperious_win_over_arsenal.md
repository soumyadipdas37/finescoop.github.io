Liverpool's title rivals will struggle to catch them, Jamie Carragher has said - even though the Premier League season is only three games old.

The pundit has been hugely impressed with how the Reds have started their Premier League title defence, with a win against lively Leeds United, followed by imperious victories over top-four challengers Chelsea and Arsenal.

In comparison, Manchester City, last year's runners-up, have already dropped points, their defence being dismantled by Jamie Vardy in a 5-2 reverse to Leicester City at the Etihad Stadium.

But it is Liverpool's 2-0 win away to Chelsea and last night's comfortable 3-1 triumph at home to the Gunners that makes the former Liverpool defender think the title may be destined to return to Anfield this season.

'The first game [a 4-3 win at home to Leeds], they didn't quite look at it,' Carragher told Sky Sports.

'But to respond with the performances they have done against two of their top-six rivals, I just think it sends out a major message these last two games that Liverpool are going to take some stopping.'

An improving Arsenal team put up a fight at Anfield on Tuesday, but Liverpool were better all over the pitch – with and without the ball – and showed a desire that suggests they want to turn last year's title success into a period of domination of English football.

It was a similar story at Stamford Bridge. Even before Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen was sent off at the end of the first half, Liverpool dominated their opponents, and in the second half they simply took the game away from the 10-man opposition.

Carragher believes the Reds have had an advantage over some of their rivals because their early exit from last year's Champions League has allowed them to prepare well for this campaign.

Manchester City and Chelsea were involved in the Champions League well into the summer and Manchester United competed in the Europa League, losing 2-1 in the semi-final to Sevilla on August 16.

'I always felt Liverpool would have an advantage in that they knew when their season was finished,' said Carragher. 'The teams in Europe could go out the next day, or stay for another week to get to a semi-final or final.'
