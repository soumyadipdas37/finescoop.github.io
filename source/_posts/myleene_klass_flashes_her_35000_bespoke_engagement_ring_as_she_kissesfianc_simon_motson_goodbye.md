Myleene teased a hint of cleavage in the summer dress which featured ruffles on the sleeves. 

She added a boost to her height with velvet platform heels and accessorised the outfit with oversized shades and one of her many Chanel handbags.

The former HearSay star wore her brunette locks in soft waves and accentuated her flawless complexion with a pretty make-up look.

Wow: Myleene settled on a black diamond ring that is the only one of its kind

Earlier this week, Myleene revealed she designed her own engagement ring following the proposal.

The mother-of-three was astounded when her partner of five years popped the question last month with a promise ring on the fifth anniversary of their first date.

After the initial shock wore off, the couple got to work designing a unique band for the star, eventually settling on a black diamond ring that is the only one of its kind.

For the project, Myleene enlisted the help of Ira Kormind, the director of 77 Diamonds and a personal friend of hers.

Together, they came up with a head-turning 7.63 carat emerald-cut natural black diamond centre stone and a dazzling split band set with 114 delicate white diamonds, meaning the whole ring comes in at around 9-carats in total. 

Oliver Horner Gemologist Prestige Pawnbrokers of Channel 4's Posh Pawn told MailOnline that the ring would retail up to £35,000. 

Speaking to Hello! magazine, Myleene told how Simon, 45, got down on one knee in their garden shed which he made into a replica of where they had their first date and surprised her with a nine-carat diamond ring.

A night to remember: Ever the romantic, Myleene told how Simon also decorated the shed walls with framed photos and filled their garden with fairy lights 

She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.

'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: 'Oh my God, he's for real.' I was completely speechless.' 

The couple's engagement has delighted Myleene's daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, who have been determined to see the couple walk down the aisle while Simon's children, a 13-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, are also thrilled. 

Myleene and Simon began dating in 2015 after she split from husband Graham Quinn in 2012, and they welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.
