Victoria put on a daring display as she shared a selfie in the yellow version of the plunging lace dress, which came complete with a pleated skirt. 

After also modelling the dress in purple, Posh said the design was 'one of my favourites', as she asked her fans: 'Which colour do we like?' 

However the star decided to switch things up as she left the Wolsley Restaurant in a ruched khaki top, yellow polo neck and a low-slung pleated midi skirt.

Victoria, like most designers, opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week as the coronavirus pandemic uproots fashion weeks around the globe. 

The Spice Girl turned fashion designer shared Instagram snaps of husband David, 45, alongside sons Romeo, 18, Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper, nine, in face masks ahead of Monday afternoon's presentation. 

Victoria captioned her snaps: 'My favourite (and only) guests this season! love you all so much @davidbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven xx we missed you @brooklynbeckham @nicolannepeltz.'

The designer showed off her latest collection with the help of four models, while there was just a handful of fashion editors in attendance for a preview at Victoria Miro art gallery in East London on Sunday.

Guests at Sunday's preview all wore monogrammed face masks that were provided at the entrance of the gallery and social distancing was enforced. 

The presentation was streamed on Victoria's website on Monday afternoon, meaning one of LFW's most anticipated shows was accessible to all.

Happy: Victoria Beckham was supported by husband David and their family on Monday as she prepared to unveil her digital presentation for London Fashion Week 

Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons as well as eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz on Instagram.

Speaking to Grazia,Victoria explained that she spent a lot of time over lockdown wondering how she was going to present the collection. 

She at first thought she would show the collection with a small presentation to just editors, before making a last minute decision to go digital and open up the LFW event to everyone. 

'There is obviously more pressure on digital content — the video that we're going to be shooting today, the pictures that we take. … I think that the challenge this season has been less about the clothes and more about everything else. I always welcome change and challenge,' Victoria said.
