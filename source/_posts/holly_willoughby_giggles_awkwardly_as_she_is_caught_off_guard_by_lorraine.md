She is known to giggle through awkward gaffes. 

And Tuesday was no exception, as Holly Willoughby was caught off guard by Lorraine during a video link segment on This Morning. 

The presenter, 39, looked flustered as she realised she was on camera while shuffling her script, which her co-host Phillip Schofield, 58, then teased her about.

'Didn't catch you surprise that time then?', Phil said.     

To which Holly replied: 'I know, Lorraine totally caught me by surprise. We've got our new seating arrangement here so if I go like this, my hand disappears.

'My scripts are, I'm a complete mess and Phil's very tidy and neat, and my scripts look like they're vomited across the table, disappearing into the abyss.

Hilarious: 'Didn't catch you surprise that time then?', Phil said. To which Holly replied: 'I know, Lorraine totally caught me by surprise'

Messy: 'My scripts are, I'm a complete mess and Phil's very tidy and neat, and my scripts look like they're vomited across the table, disappearing into the abyss'

'And then Lorraine caught me! I didn't realise I was on, I was literally like "nothing to see here, look over there!".'

The duo are now using a clever split screen which makes it look like they are sitting next to each other, but in reality they are obliging to social distancing rules.   

The split screen baffled some viewers, while others said they loved it.

One wrote: 'Misleading the public with split screen, making it look like they're sitting next to each other. Are the public not getting enough mixed messages just now!!'

Another typed: 'Just turned #thismorning on, have I missed something? Holly & Phil appear to be sitting closer together'.

A different fan of the show wrote: 'Love the  split screen'.

Holly took to Instagram ahead of the show to showcase her chic monochrome outfit.
