A Chinese driver has dodged serious injuries after being hurled onto his car's roof during a high-speed motorway crash. 

The motorist, known only by his surname Wang, was standing in front of his broken-down car when a van rear-ended it in eastern China's Jiangsu Province last week, according to police.

Mr Wang sustained minor injuries, officers said.

Footage released by police shows the white van crashing into the stationary car on the Nanjing Baguazhou Yangtze River Bridge on the afternoon of September 2.

It shows Mr Wang, who was attempting to repair his car, getting thrown into the air and then landing on top of his vehicle.

A social media post from Nanjing Traffic Police claimed that Mr Wang was standing in front of the bonnet and checking the engine when a transit van slammed into the vehicle.

Police said the motorist, known as Mr Wang, sustained multiple bruises on his arms and legs

The accident is said to have involved four vehicles, including a truck that rear-ended the van

In the dash-cam footage filmed by a passing vehicle, the victim is seen standing in front of his car as it obstructs the outside lane on the motorway.

Meanwhile, the van driver crashes into the back of the man's car and flips the owner onto the roof.

Mr Wang was later taken to a local hospital. He had multiple bruises on his arms and legs, reported local news outlet Nanjing Daily citing the police.

The accident is said to have involved four vehicles, including a truck that rear-ended the van.

Mr Wang was the only person that got hurt in the accident, the report claimed.
