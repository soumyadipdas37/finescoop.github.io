The model's Ibiza holiday comes after she discussed how she coped with grief after her parents' death.

The model suffered the loss of her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, with tragedy striking again soon after when her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.

And amid her heartache, the star also discussed her mental health, telling how it almost 'got the better' of her during lockdown, in a candid chat to mark World Suicide Prevention Day.

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Demi said: 'It was almost surreal when my father died and then my mother so soon afterwards.

'I felt angry, sad, bitter and lonely but I am just so lucky that I had a good support system to carry me.

'Being able to talk about grief is so important and not bottle it up. That’s why my message is so important to encourage people to talk.'

Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.

She went on: 'Behind closed doors there’s been a lot of torment and I suppose I have turned that into a positive as I feel I have been through so much nothing can push me down again'.
