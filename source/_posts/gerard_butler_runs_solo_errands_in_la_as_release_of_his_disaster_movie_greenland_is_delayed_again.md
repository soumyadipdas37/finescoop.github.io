It was announced late Monday that Butler's new film Greenland has been pushed back again due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The actor, who also produces many of his own projects including this one, stars with Morena Baccarin in the disaster movie. 

Butler and Baccarin play an estranged couple who share a young son and who set out on a perilous journey in search of safety after a comet strikes the earth and unleashes a global apocalypse.  

Variety reported that distributor STX is moving Greenland from its already rescheduled release date of September 25 to an undisclosed date in the fourth quarter. 

The sci-fi thriller had originally been slated to open in June in the hopes of generating a long box office over the summer. 

Postponed: It was announced late Monday that Butler's new film Greenland  won't be released on September 25 after all and has been pushed back again due to the COVID-19 pandemic

In mid-August, People reported that Butler and his girlfriend of six years Brown had split.

The couple had had an on/off relationship for most of that period, starting to date in 2014 then breaking up in 2015.

They had reunited in 2016 and for a while it had appeared their romance was on a surer footing.

Brown accompanied Butler to the August 2019 premiere of his movie Angel Has Fallen in August 2019 and she was also his date at the Academy Awards this past February.
