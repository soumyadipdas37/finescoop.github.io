The couple recently revealed they are engaged after Simon, 45, popped the question on the fifth anniversary of their first date.

The former Hear'Say singer also answered several questions about her stunning engagement ring, which the couple designed together. 

Asked if she knew Simon would propose when he did because they designed the ring, Myleene said: 'No because we designed the ring afterwards! 

'I really had no idea about the proposal. So much so that I ate two family packs of crisps on the motorway driving back from work. I got home at midnight to a full course meal that he'd been working on all day.'   

Myleene's ring is a black diamond which she explained was a result of her deciding 'black goes with anything'.

She said: 'I discovered it's one of the toughest forms of natural diamond! And black goes with anything. 

'After Sim proposed, I got it into my head that I wanted a coloured diamond for my ring. We went for a natural (not synthetically coloured) Black Diamond. 

'I had NO idea where to source such a rare, black diamond but my friend Ira, @77diamonds and her team helped me!'   

Asked why the couple decided to design the ring together, Myleene replied: 'Sim's an awesome designer.

Design: Asked why the couple decided to design the ring together, Myleene replied: 'Sim's an awesome designer

'He works in design and production and some of my work is also in design and branding too so making it together seemed like a really lovely idea. Don't worry, he still proposed with a beautiful gold and diamond "promise ring".' 

Myleene is mother to daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, from her relationship with ex husband Graham Quinn while Simon also has two children of the same ages from a previous relationship. The couple welcomed their son Apollo in August last year.

When asked if she had any tips for ensuring everyone in a blended family gets along, Myleene said: 'Be open with everyone as to what's going on so they trust you and know their truth. Set boundaries. Stick to the boundaries.'

Myleene was recently announced as one of the contestants on this year's series of Dancing On Ice alongside the likes of Denise Van Outen, Rebekah Vardy and Olympic skier Graham Bell.

She wrote: 'Gazillion for the excitement and learning a new skill, and off the scale for the fear! There are Olympic skiers in the line up and I can't even skate! (YET! as my daughter Ava keeps reminding me)'. 

Asked what part of the show she is most looking forward to, Myleene said: 'Learning how to stop instead of grabbing onto the edge/passing toddlers. The outfits. The music. @Johnscottbarrowman'. 

Myleene and Simon began dating in 2015 after she split from husband Graham Quinn in 2012.

The radio presenter previously admitted she was shocked when Simon popped the question last month on the fifth anniversary of their first date.

Speaking to Hello! magazine, Myleene told how Simon got down on one knee in their garden shed which he made into a replica of where they had their first date and surprised her with a nine-carat diamond ring.

She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.

'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: "Oh my God, he's for real." I was completely speechless.'
