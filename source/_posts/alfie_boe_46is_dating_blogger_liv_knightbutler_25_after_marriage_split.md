It was reported last month that the West End star started exchanging messages with a woman, who was said to be a broadcaster 16 years his junior, from December 2018 for five months, until his performance at London's Royal Albert Hall in April 2019.

A source told the Sun: 'She was sat in the friends and family section, and when Alfie said he was dedicating The Way You Look Tonight to 'someone special' she nudged her pal thinking he meant her.

New claims: Alfie reportedly enjoyed secret dates with another woman while married. Pictured with his now estranged wife Sarah in 2014

'When he paid tribute to Sarah — after claiming for months that he wasn't happy — and then blocked her that same night, it made her feel worthless.'

The source added of Alfie: 'Alfie was so charming that she fell for him completely. He even rang her at midnight on New Year's Eve, which she really appreciated.' 

The claims came after it was reported that Alfie had split from his wife Sarah after 16 years of marriage and was allegedly looking for women on a celebrity dating app.

'I have nothing but love and respect for Sarah who's been an incredible partner and an amazing mother to our two beautiful children and everything is very amicable.'

Past users have included Emma Watson, Cara Delevingne, Lily Allen, Jack Whitehall, and Kelly Osbourne.

But Alfie denied his involvement in the app, saying: 'Other parts of the story though are absolute nonsense, I would just kindly ask for respect of our privacy during this time as we work things out and I thank you all for your welcomed support.'
