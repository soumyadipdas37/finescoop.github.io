The majority of car drivers exceed the speed limit on 30mph roads, according to new figures revealed by the Department for Transport today.

Analysis of these roads across Britain found that 54 per cent of cars were driven too fast during free-flow conditions last year, despite these routes mostly being through residential areas and towns and cities with lots of pedestrians and cyclists.

This is compared with 50 per cent on motorways and just 9 per cent on 60mph roads, the government department found.

Speed demons: Figures published by the Department for Transport today show that 54% of car drivers speed through 30mph zones -  more than those who drive too fast on motorways

Based on records gathered during 2019, the DfT said a fifth of cars exceeded 30mph limits by more than 5mph, while 6 per cent were recorded doing at least 40mph.

That said, the average speed driven in the zones – which are generally in built-up areas – was 31mph.

Some 86 per cent of cars were found to exceed 20mph limits, however, the DfT said this figure should be 'interpreted with additional caution'.

This is because many 20mph roads in quieter, residential areas have traffic calming measures, making them unsuitable for the research. 

One in three towns will switch to a 20mph speed limit as councils are favouring slower zones for residential areas due to the perception that it will make routes safer, according to recent reports. 

The DfT study found that 54% of car drivers exceed 30mph zones

Just 9% of car drivers speed on single carriageways, according to these figures

Half of car drivers exceed the national limit on motorways, the government department found

The figures show that motorcyclists most commonly speed in 30mph zones, with more than three in five (63 per cent) riding too fast.

Some 55 per cent of van drivers also speed through 30mph limits.

Most worrying is the finding that more than half of articulated (44 per cent) and rigid HGV (47 per cent) drivers also break 30mph limits, despite the size of the vehicles and the damage they can cause to vulnerable road users. 

The figures show that motorcyclists most commonly speed in 30mph zones, with more than three in five (63%) riding too fast 

RAC road safety spokesman Simon Williams described the DfT's findings as 'alarming'.

'We know that during the days of strict lockdown there was a real prevalence of speeding in built-up areas,' he said.

'Breaking speed limits is illegal and puts everyone using the road in danger. It's vital the Government's review into road policing addresses the elephant in the room – a lack of enforcement.'

Inappropriate speed contributes to around 11 per cent of all injury collisions reported to the police, 15 per cent of crashes resulting in a serious injury and 24 per cent of collisions that result in a death, according to recent figures from road safety group Rospa.  

It says that around two-thirds of crashes in which people are killed or injured occur on roads with a speed limit of 30mph or less and highlighted the impact of exceeding this limit.

It warns: 'At 30mph, vehicles are travelling at 44 feet (about 3 car lengths) each second. One blink and the driver may fail to see the early warning brake lights; a short glance away and the movement of a child behind a parked car will be missed. 

'Even in good conditions, the difference in stopping distance between 30mph and 35mph is an extra 21 feet or 6.4 metres, more than two car lengths.' 

Road safety groups have warned that the difference in stopping distance between 30mph and 35mph is an extra two car lengths

Commenting on the DfTs report, Road Safety Minister Baroness Vere said: 'Speeding is illegal, reckless and puts people's lives at unnecessary risk. That is why there are tough penalties and strict enforcement measures in place for those who disobey the law.

'We know it's just as crucial though to change attitudes that lead to dangerous driving.

'Our road safety statement and its two-year action plan include aims to tackle speeding, while our Think! campaign targets risky driving behaviour by challenging social norms among high-risk young men.'

Ministers are also considering the introduction of 'graduated driving licences' for new motorists.

This could see newly-qualified drivers face night curfews, passenger restrictions and limitations on the types of cars they can use in the first months of being allowed on the road on their own. 

Peter Brabin, head of training at Bill Plant Driving School, said there is no excuse for speeding on any roads, and warned that 30mph limits are there due to the volume of hazards around these routes.

He told This is Money: 'Driving over the speed limit, even by a few miles per hour, really isn’t worth the risk. You risk harming others or yourself, fines and points that could lead to you losing your driving licence. 

'When speeding you are less likely to be able to react safely to events that could occur, especially in built up areas where 30mph is the speed limit and hazards are everywhere.

'Throughout taking driving lessons you will be taught to maintain the speed limit. It’s vital to keep an eye on your speed and adjust it even if you’re going one or two mph over the limit. 

'There really is no excuse for speeding and we believe anyone caught speeding, especially to excess, should be dealt with accordingly.'
