She always looks sensational whenever she steps out.

And Maura Higgins was sure to set pulses racing as she slipped into some racy white lingerie for pictures shared to her Instagram account on Sunday. 

The Love Island star, 29, sizzled as she flaunted her incredible figure in a floral lace bra and made sure to work all her angles for the camera.

Maura exuded confidence during her at-home photoshoot, putting on a sultry display as she looked directly at the camera and pursed her lips.

The beauty's sexy set, from Ann Summers, boasted a delicate lace pattern with sequin embellishments and an eyelash trim.

Ensuring all eyes were on her underwear, Maura kept her accessories to a minimum only donning some stylish gold hoop earrings and a chic bracelet.

She wore her brunette locks pinned back, allowing two strands at the front to frame her face, and also added a full face of makeup to accentuate her pretty features.

The snaps come after Maura was seen at Love Island co-star Chris Taylor's home with an overnight bag after spending an evening out with him last month.

The pair reportedly went back to his house at 11:15pm after he drove her home to collect her things. 

In pictures obtained by The Sun, Maura can be seen carrying her things towards Chris' front door as he lets her in.

The publication reports that the pair spent the evening ice skating and tenpin bowling at Queensway rink in Notting Hill.

They then went for dinner together before arriving back at Chris' place just before midnight.  

The sleepover will have fans speculating that Maura and Chris are more than just friends, which they have denied in the past. 

Maura recently told The Sun's Fabulous magazine that she has not had sex for six months due to the coronavirus lockdown. 

She said: 'I 100 per cent feel the sexiest of my life. I'm getting sexy for my new man! Now I definitely feel like I'm ready to be with somebody.

'I'm 100 per cent single and ready to mingle. God help the next man I meet. I'm not sure he'll be able to put up with me!'

Chris previously addressed the rumours about him and Maura on Vicky Pattison's The Secret To podcast.  

The Geordie Shore star asked him if there was any truth to the fan theories that they were together but he bluntly replied: 'No, no, we're not.'  

But Vicky didn't back down, telling him that the pair would make the 'best couple'.

He replied: 'Yeah, potentially. We've never really thought about it like that, we're just super close mates.

'We like each other and the thing is, it's never been something that's crossed our minds and it wouldn't happen for the fact that we don't want to ruin our friendship.

'We don't see each other that way. We're platonic, as they say, platonic friends.'  

Maura had previously been dating Curtis Pritchard, who she split from in March, while Chris was most recently in a relationship with Harley Brash.
