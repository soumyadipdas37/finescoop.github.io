Dana White has hit out at Conor McGregor after the Irishman aired private messages between himself and the UFC chief in a series of tweets on Friday. 

Former two-weight world champion McGregor took to social media to show his side of the story after UFC veteran Diego Sanchez, 38, called the 32-year-old out. 

McGregor had plans to enjoy a 'season' this year, with the Notorious interested in fighting four times in 2020 following his win over Donald Cerrone at UFC 246 in January.

McGregor ranted on Twitter about his decision to quit UFC, posting a number of screenshots

To Diego Sanchez... I seen your recent comments about your final bout and I am in! After you fought Pereira, I had requested for myself and you to compete in Dublin. This was back in February when I was working on opposition for my season, pre covid. Good luck this weekend! pic.twitter.com/Y0hf6Zr7XF

However, the coronavirus pandemic threw a major spanner in the works for McGregor and the UFC, with Dana White reluctant to allow his prized star to fight in front of no fans.

McGregor retired from mixed martial arts earlier this year, but published a series of screenshots of private Instagram messages between himself and White, which show the Notorious discussing options for future bouts. 

'A fight late May in LA. Me and Diego in Dublin in August,' the messages read. 'Rematch end of the year. BOOM. Me and Diego in Dublin is a cracker.'

But White has not taken well to the Irishman's sharing of his private conversation to his 8.2m Twitter followers.

The messages showed that McGregor wanted a bout with UFC veteran Diego Sanchez

'I had people blowing me up left and right,' he said following UFC 253. 'I mean everybody here knows, I mean even the ladies, this is some man-code stuff but it's just something you don't do.

'It's just something that you don't do. It is one of the dirtiest things you can do.'

The messages showed White arguing that 'we should lose our promotor's licence' if he were to allow McGregor to fight Sanchez, an unranked veteran who would not stand a good chance of defeating the Irishman. 

'Which, by the way, we were just talking about Diego Sanchez,' he continued.

White denied that fight and now McGregor has turned his attention to Manny Pacquiao 

'And Diego Sanchez was in there in this private conversation that I was having with Conor McGregor.

'When you are the No2 or No3 ranked guy in the world, and you're telling me that you want to fight unranked 39-year-old Diego Sanchez in the main event of Los Angeles. Well...'

McGregor posted the screenshots in a bid to prove his efforts to arrange a UFC bout, but says that he has plans to return to boxing in a mega-fight with pound-for-pound star Manny Pacquiao.  

'Anyways boxing it is for now and I'm up for this! I hope no bottling takes place here,' he wrote on Instagram on Saturday.

'I'm already agreeing to these limited rules and holding back my full array of weapons. Let's get it going guys.

'Much love, the champ champ.'
