She recently admitted she cut her long-term friend out of her life after they had a falling out eight months ago.

But Chloe Sims appeared to have patched things up with Pete Wicks as they caught up over pizza while filming scenes for TOWIE on Thursday.

The reality star, 37, commanded attention in her typical fashion as she was dressed in a clingy brown bodysuit, teamed with matching textured shorts.

On Sunday's episode of TOWIE, the duo spoke out about their ongoing feud, admitting they have gone months without speaking to each other.  

The mother-of-one had a socially distanced gathering with Olivia Attwood, James 'Diags' Bennewith and Liam 'Gatsby' Blackwell, where she opened up about their argument. 

Speaking about lockdown, she said: 'It’s a terrible thing for a lot of people but there has been some positives. 

'It brought the families closer together and it’s actually showed me who’s important in my life. "Best friends" who didn’t really give a s**t.

'Me and Pete stopped speaking. We had a falling out since the end of January. It wasn’t nasty, it was quite calm but I didn’t want to have people around me who aren’t 100%. I just said, "I can’t have you in my life anymore."'

Bottoms up! The influencer was seen carrying a large cocktail around the field

Chloe did not elaborate on what the dispute was about or why she had decided to stop speaking to Pete.

Love Island's Olivia said: 'I'm surprised he didn’t reach out to you during lockdown. He’d normally check in, especially on you, but there you go', to which Chloe replied: 'He made me question if I even knew him at all.'

Later in the episode, the bride-to-be met with Pete and took the opportunity to hear his side of the story.  

Recalling their falling out, he said: 'We had a barney and the last thing she said to me was we didn’t need to talk so so be it. 

'We’ve been close for so many years and this was the first time we’ve disagreed and I’ve thought, "you know what she doesn’t want me in her life." It’s the longest we’ve ever gone without talking.'

Pete admitted he would like to patch things up with Chloe but he worries that their friendship was beyond repair.  

He said: 'What does worry me, if I do reach out to her and she says f**k off, it’ll hurt me. Do I want to save the friendship? Of course I do. Do I think it can be saved? No.'
