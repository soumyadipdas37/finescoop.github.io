A perverted father-of-three who sexually assaulted his daughter from the age of six has been jailed for three years.

The 50-year-old paedophile, who can't be named to protect his daughter, forced the young girl to masturbate him in the shower with soap about 200 times.  

The Queensland girl was objected to the horrifying abuse until just before her tenth birthday when her mother discovered what was happening.

The court heard the man told his daughter it was 'a secret and not to tell her mother,' Townsville Bulletin reported.

Prosecutor Amanda Payne told the court the father would threaten his child if she refused - and even offered her money on one occasion.

The man was arrested by police after the child's mother found out what was happening. 

He initially claimed his child instigated what happened in the shower but changed his story and admitted he asked her to 'wash his penis'.  

One of the five charges he pleaded guilty to was maintaining an unlawful relationship with a child. 

The man's defence lawyer told the court the man suffered from a range of health issues and had no use of his left arm.

Judge Julie Dick SC said the man 'indulged' himself and used his daughter for his own 'pleasure'.

'You have betrayed your trust to her in a very, very severe way and over a lengthy period of time,' she said.

'You are the natural father and that usually means you naturally protect your child and you didn't, you took advantage of her.'

The man was jailed for three years - with a parole date set for September 28, 2021.
