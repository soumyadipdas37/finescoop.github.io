Just weeks after his Range Rover was stolen, I’m saddened to report that Mamma Mia! star Dominic Cooper has fallen foul of car thieves once again. 

The actor, 42, posted an online appeal for witnesses after claiming a man pilfered something from his £54,000 open-top Jaguar F-Type coupe in Primrose Hill, North London. 

Dominic captured images of the alleged offender on CCTV and wrote on the website Nextdoor: ‘This bloke just broke into my car. Keep your eye out.’

He has played countless aristocrats on screen but velvet-voiced Charles Dance insists he is as common as muck. 

The actor, 73, says: ‘My mother was born in London’s East End. She was one of three or four kids and did not have two half pennies to rub together.

'She went into service when she was 13.’

Charles, who has an OBE, added: ‘Because of the way my face is put together, I am often cast aristocratically. There is nothing aristocratic about me whatsoever. I am as common as muck, you know.’
