There were plenty of tears and tantrums during Thursday's season finale of The Bachelor - but there was one thing missing from the closing scenes: host Osher Günsberg.

The 46-year-old revealed on the Cocktails and Roses podcast on Friday that he'd filmed his usual interview segments, but they were left on the cutting room floor for 'editorial' reasons.

He said the post-production team made the decision to edit out his 'pep talks' with Locky Gilbert and his two finalists because they interrupted the emotional flow of the episode.

Where was he? Host Osher Günsberg has revealed why he was edited out of Thursday night's finale of The Bachelor

Right before Locky decided between his two finalists, Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska, viewers watched him break down in a piece-to-camera confessional.

Osher explained that this unplanned moment made producers realise they didn't need his interviews to build up tension ahead of the final scenes.

'I was there. I was absolutely there. And I did all of the chats. I did all of the proud dad stuff. I did the [interviews] when the girls got out of the car, I did all that,' he said.

'I did the chat with Locky. I gave him that "come on, mate, this is it." I gave them all the pep talks and all that kind of stuff.

'However, the way that it happened with Locky's interview and the way he was so intensely emotional in that interview - which was I think the morning of [the finale] - going to ad break with him in this jeopardy moment of "I don't know what to do" and cutting straight to the girls was the right editorial decision. 

'Otherwise, the energy would have been gone.'

Osher clarified that he 'still got paid for the day' even though his scenes weren't aired, and said he didn't mind being cut because The Bachelor 'isn't about me'.

He added that he watched Locky, 31, break up with Bella and subsequently declare his love for Irena from a production tent nearby along with the rest of the crew.

Later, he tweeted that the moment was so excruciating he could 'barely watch'.  

Osher usually figures prominently in season finales of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.

Osher's revelation comes after a conflicted Locky chose Irena, 31, as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale on Thursday.

'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.

'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

Moments earlier, he'd delivered the bad news to 25-year-old Bella - despite having told her beforehand that he was 'falling in love' with her.
