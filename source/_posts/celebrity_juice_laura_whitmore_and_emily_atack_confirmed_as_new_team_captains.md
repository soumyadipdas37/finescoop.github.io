'We're so excited!' The presenter, 35, and the former Inbetweeners actress, 30, took to Instagram on Thursday to confirm their new roles as the show's new team captains

The ladies have both starred as guests on the much-loved show, but the upcoming series will mark the first time they will battle it out with their star-studded teams, which are yet to be announced. 

Insisting she's not going down without a fight, TV star Emily said in a press release: 'Every time I’ve been on Juice in the past I’ve had such a good time, and now I’m doing it with two of my best mates and I’m a ruddy team captain!!! Can’t believe it. 

'I dread to think what we're going to be faced with, but Whitmore should know that I won’t be backing down and she is going to have some tough competition. But more importantly a wonderfully hilarious time. Bring it on!'

Her new opponent jokingly hit back: 'I can’t wait to see what Keith has got lined up for Emily and I this series… From past experiences, nothing would surprise me. I cannot wait to get stuck in and lead my team to victory each week… I love you Emily, but watch out! I’m so excited to start!

All over: This Morning star Holly launched the show with the funnyman and close friend Fearne Cotton in 2008 (pictured)

'I’ve been the biggest fan for years, I used to go and sit in the audience when I first moved to London and can’t believe I’m a team captain now!' 

The last edition, which aired from April until May, was fronted by both broadcaster Holly, 39, and Spice Girls' Mel B, 45.

Kelly Brook, Gino D'Acampo and Paddy McGuinness have also served as team captains in the past. 

The This Morning star launched the show with Keith and her BFF Fearne Cotton in 2008.

 

Farewell: In a sweet Instagram post, Holly thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' as she left just five months after former Top of the Pops star Fearne, also 39

Big loss: Insiders previously claimed the decision came as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers 

In a sweet Instagram post, Holly thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' as she left just five months after former Top of the Pops star Fearne, also 39.  

Insiders previously claimed the decision came as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers. 

Although Holly had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.

She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term ‘Holly Willoughbooby’ was coined to described her curvaceous figure.

Her resignation came shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice’s creators – stopped producing the show. 

Success: Celebrity Juice has proved to be enormously popular following its launch
