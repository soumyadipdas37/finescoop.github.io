They might be more at home in the wilds of Ethiopia, but this gelada seemed happy enough relaxing at his home near Bristol yesterday.

The magnificent beast, technically a monkey though often called a baboon, was pictured frolicking on his deck at the Wild Place Project, a conservation park in south Gloucestershire.

The family-run park has six males, ranging in age from 10-year-old Kito to 18-year-old Hobbit. Geladas are also known as 'bleeding-heart monkeys' due to the red patch on their chests.

Their thick coats protect them from the extremes of temperatures in the mountains of northern Ethiopia, but also come in handy if it gets a bit blowy off the River Avon.

And judging by the yawn this one let out, they keep you the perfect temperature for an afternoon nap.

Happy days: Normally found in the mountains of northern Ethiopia, this male is one of six at the Gloucestershire wildlife park
