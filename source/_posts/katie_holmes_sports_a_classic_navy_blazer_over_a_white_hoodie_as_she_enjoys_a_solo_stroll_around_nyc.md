Katie Holmes appeared to be enjoying some alone time on a solo stroll through her neighborhood in New York City. 

The 41-year-old actress, who has been nearly inseparable with her new boyfriend Emilio Vitolo Jr., cut a casual figure in a white hoodie and a pair of light-wash grey jeans on Wednesday. 

Despite sporting a messy top knot, the street style icon dressed up her laid-back look with a structured navy jacket and a pair of lace-up Oxfords.

Following NYC's strict mask mandate in public areas, the Dawson's Creek alum kept her nose and mouse protected under a white facial covering. 

Her outing comes after she is reportedly 'smitten' with her new 33-year-old beau, who she has been packing on the PDA with since they were first publicly spotted together earlier this month.  

A source recently told People, she 'keeps texting Emilio all day long and he loves it.'

'He can't get enough of her attention,' the insider noted, who claims Emilio is 'very charming' and 'flirty.' 

Emilio Jr. and Katie have been spotted together outside at his father's popular restaurant Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan several times in the last few weeks, as well as on dates throughout the city.

They were first spotted together on Tuesday, September 1 on a date at a restaurant in Soho; the duo were laughing and smiling at each other.

The duo confirmed their romance with a hot and heavy make out session at Peasant Restaurant in Manhattan; the actress sat on his lap as they kissed each other passionately, on Sunday, September 6.

Last Wednesday, DailyMail.com also revealed that Vitolo broke it off with his live-in fiancée Rachel Emmons, 24, via text when handsy photos of him and Holmes were first published, leaving the handbag designer shocked and forcing her to move back home.

Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019, and she doesn't seem to have been bothered by his engagement.

Katie and Emilio first met when a mutual friend introduced them, and their passions have only intensified since she returned home to New York City following time quarantining with her family in Ohio.

An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.

The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with the playboy actor, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.

The acting couple were first linked in 2013 hand-in-hand through Malibu, but they kept their relationship private throughout the years, but split after going public last year at the Met Gala.

Holmes was famously married to Tom Cruise, from 2006 until 2012, and they share daughter Suri, born in 2006.
