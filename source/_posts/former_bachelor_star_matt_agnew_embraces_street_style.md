Former Bachelor Matt Agnew has embraced a more relaxed approach to personal grooming during lockdown in Melbourne. 

And on Sunday, the 33-year-old unveiled his latest transformation.  

Taking to Instagram, Matt showed himself in an Adidas tracksuit along with a Tamagotchi round his neck, reminiscent of 1990s Japanese street style.

As a sign of the times, Matt wore a black face mask. He also wore a beanie and pristine white lace-up sneakers.   

'I'm not like a regular tamagotchi dad. I'm a cool tamagotchi dad,' Matt wrote under the post, appearing to reference the 2004 film, Mean Girls.

Earlier this month, Matt shocked fans with his new look with the usually clean-shaven reality star sporting a five o'clock shadow in a selfie shared to Instagram.

Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for not recognising Matt without his signature 'geeky' glasses, clean-cut look and sharp tuxedo.  

The data scientist nonetheless looked handsome with stubble and a grey beanie as he drew attention to a worthwhile cause. 

Matt's followers remarked on his changing appearance in the comments section of another recent Instagram photo.

'Gezzzz, you have changed. You don't look the same,' one wrote, while another added: 'You look different today.' 

However, those familiar with Matt's journey over the past few years will know that he has always preferred a more laid-back style.

He liked to keep things casual during his pre-Bachelor days as a university academic, with photos from that period showing him looking quite ordinary compared to the Mills & Boon-esque leading man he was portrayed as on TV.

Matt chose 28-year-old chemical engineer Chelsie McLeod as his winner on The Bachelor last year, but their relationship didn't last.

The couple confirmed their split two months after the finale air date, and Chelsie later hinted it wasn't her decision to end things.

One of Matt's contestants, Elly Miles, is the new Bachelorette. She will be joined on her journey by her sister, Becky.
