Coco Rocha has hit out at trolls who accused her of 'hiding' her baby bump on social media. 

In an impassioned Instagram post, the 31-year-old Canadian model lashed out at followers who told her she should be 'proud' of her pregnancy curves and 'show them off' more. 

Insisting that she wasn't attempting to hide anything in the first place, Coco went on to note that it's nobody else's business what she chooses to show or not. 

Clapping back: Pregnant Coco Rocha hit back at trolls by sharing a bikini snap on Instagram on Monday after being accused of 'hiding' her baby bum

Coco looked sensational in the snaps that accompanied her post as she posed in a high waisted lemon print bikini. 

The Vogue cover girl then shared a screengrab of one of the comments she had received, in which a follower accused her of looking like someone who is 'trying to hide her bump'. 

Hitting back at the comment, Coco remarked: 'I’ve seen (and subsequently blocked and deleted) a few comments on here from some accusing me of “hiding” my pregnancy bump and asking me to instead be “proud of it” and telling me that I need to “show it” more.'



Shocked: Coco was left raging after followers accused her of 'hiding' her shape beneath a sweet picture of herself cuddling her children and husband 

She continued: 'First of all, I literally announced I was pregnant 5 weeks ago via @people magazine, so if I was trying to hide it, I did a terrible job of that. 

'Second, never tell a woman what part of her body you think you have a right to see on her social media. 

'Third, please try to love yourself and your own life instead of wasting your days criticizing someone else. 

'I’m 100% loving my life, my family, my pregnancy, my body, my bump and especially my day by the pool! #stylethebump'.

Last month, Coco announced she is five-and-a-half months pregnant with her third child.

The model and her husband James Conran announced they are expecting a baby girl later this year and said their daughter Ioni, five, and son Iver, two, couldn't be more excited at the prospect of their new family member.

Speaking to PEOPLE magazine, Coco said: 'We are having a girl and big sister is so excited.

She loves having a baby brother, but she's like, "I got one of those. So let's get another one, another version". She wants to do all the mommy stuff. It's going to be like having a baby doll.'

Coco revealed that they discovered she was pregnant with their third child just before the nationwide coronavirus lockdown was announced. 

Although Coca admitted she has been feeling 'really good' throughout the pregnancy and is glad to have her family around, she revealed she was missing James attend appointments and scans with her.

She said: 'The only hardship is that you can't bring daddy in. We get to FaceTime and I know I've seen some other celebrities kind of showing how that's worked for them,' she says. It is a very different scenario, but I do appreciate everyone taking it so seriously. And the doctors have been awesome.'
