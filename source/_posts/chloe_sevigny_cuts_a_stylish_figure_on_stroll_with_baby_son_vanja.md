She welcomed her first child, a baby boy, with boyfriend Sinisa Mačković back in May. 

And Chloe Sevigny, 45, looked every inch the doting mum as she headed out with her four-month-old son Vanja in New York on Thursday.

The actress cut a stylish figure in a polka dot and floral patterned shirt which she teamed with Adidas flared joggers.

Although the American Psycho actress appeared to be enjoying the outing, Chloe recently admitted to W Magazine that going out these days makes her anxious.

She said: 'I would say that my neuroses around that have really amped up because of the small child and my mother. I guess it’s not even neuroses at this point, it’s just what everybody is doing. It’s common.' 

Chloe added: 'I’m walking around a lot, I like to push him around in the stroller, and a lot of people walk by shouting without masks on.

'Like, just put it on! Is it that hard? I know it’s hot and that’s miserable, but bring an extra one so you can change, or don’t shout.' 

Chloe and Sinisa started dating in 2018 and announced the birth of Vanja, on May 2, earlier this year.  

'Welcome to the world Vanja Sevigny Mačković Born May 2nd New York City Thank you to all the staff at Mt. Sinai East for your bravery, perseverance and kindness, especially the nurses for being so gentle and patient,' she wrote at the time.

The star added: 'Blessings to all the other families giving birth during this time. #ilovemyboys'
