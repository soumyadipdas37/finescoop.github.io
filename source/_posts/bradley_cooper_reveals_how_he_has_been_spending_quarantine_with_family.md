Bradley Cooper has revealed how he has been spending quarantine with his mother Gloria Campano and daughter Lea.

The actor, 45, was speaking with his A Star Is Born costar Anthony Ramos for Interview Magazine, where he revealed he had not left the house because of his mother's health.  

Bradley also said he had been 'running a one-man playschool' for his three-year-old daughter, whom he has been teaching how to swim in their bathtub.

'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house. My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over,' he said.

'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.'

Bradley shares his daughter Lea with ex-girlfriend Irina Shayk, whom he split from last year after four years together.

In an interview with British Vogue earlier this summer, Irina discussed her relationship with 'B.'

'I think in all good relationships you bring your best and your worst – it's just the nature of a human being. Two great people don't have to make a good couple. I think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other. Life without B is new ground,' she said. 

Irina admitted to having moments struggling to acclimate to life as a single mother. 

'It's hard to find a balance between being a single mom and being a working woman and provider. Trust me, there are days I wake up and I'm like, "Oh my god, I don't know what to do, I'm falling apart."'

Shortly before announcing their split, Bradley and his A Star Is Born costar Lady Gaga landed at the center of romance rumors following an intimate performance of their song Shallow at the Academy Awards.

Gaga has since denied the rumors.   

Bradley starred in and directed the 2019 hit film A Star Is Born, which saw him star opposite Lady Gaga and Anthony Ramos as a down-on-his-luck country singer.

Ramos was complimentary of Bradley during their Interview chat, referring to him as 'one of the greatest directors of all time.'

'First and foremost, people ask me all the time, "How was it working with Bradley Cooper?" I say, "He's probably one of the great- est directors of all time. That dude is one of the best teachers I have ever had the honor and privilege to learn under." If I could sit on the set with you and just learn, I don't even need to be in the movie. Just give me a seat, and I'll sit back and watch you work.'

Bradley has returned to work, despite the current waging pandemic.

The actor has been spotted on the set of the currently untitled Paul Thomas Anderson film in Encino, California these last few days.

Little is known about the plot except that is set in San Fernando Valley in the 1970s and follows a high school student who also works as a child actor.
