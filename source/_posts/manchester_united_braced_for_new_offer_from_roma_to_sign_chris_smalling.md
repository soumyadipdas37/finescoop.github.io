Roma are prepared to put a new offer on the table for Manchester United defender Chris Smalling.

The 30-year-old made an impact during a season-long loan last season, making 37 appearances, and it's understood the Serie A side are keen to bring him in on a permanent deal.

Roma are now readying an offer for the defender to try to seal his signature before the transfer window closes in October.

Smalling returned to Old Trafford following the conclusion of the 2019-20 domestic season with his loan not extended to play in the delayed Europa League in August.Â 

United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did insist that the centre-half does have a future at the club.

'I think Chris has shown over his career at Man United how valuable he is for Man United,' he said.

'This season was about him being a regular, going to Roma, showing and proving how good a centre-back he is.

'I wanted to give Harry (Maguire), Vic (Victor Lindelof), maybe Axel (Tuanzebe) a chance, so we found out that was the best for him to go to Roma, play for a year.

'Now he's coming back and Chris has shown this season that he will be valuable. I've been speaking to Chris throughout and been delighted with his season.'

Solskjaer is continuing to rebuild his Red Devils squad as he eyes improving on last season's third-placed finish in the Premier League.
