Ahead of their flight, the pair were seen exiting her apartment together in the same outfits.

For their excursion, the beauty put on a leggy display in a pair of black spandex shorts, a grey cable knit top with a V-neck and an oversized blazer.

'Kaia is the one that doesn't want to be in an exclusive relationship right now. She has a lot of projects on her plate and wants her freedom,' a source said.

'She does love hanging out with Jacob and they are spending time in New York City for the week while she works.'

Jacob was last rumored to be dating Zendaya, with the duo first becoming linked during a getaway to Greece in August 2019.

While the two never announced their relationship, a source confirmed the actors were indeed dating in an Us Weekly report in February 2020.  

Jacob's recent outings with Kaia have sparked speculation his relationship with Zendaya has ended.  

Kaia was previously in a relationship with SNL star Pete Davidson, but more recently sparked romantic speculation with fellow model Cara Delevingne when the duo were spotted affectionately embracing at a Black Lives Matter rally in July.

Not only that, but the women also got matching 'Solemate' tattoos on their feet in August.
