Despite the pandemic, Beyonce has remained busy professionally these last few months, with the release of her visual album Black Is King.

'The events of 2020 have made the film's vision and message even more relevant, as people across the world embark on a historic journey. We are all in search of safety and light,' she wrote on Instagram.

'Many of us want change. I believe that when Black people tell our own stories, we can shift the axis of the world and tell our REAL history of generational wealth and richness of soul that are not told in our history books.'
