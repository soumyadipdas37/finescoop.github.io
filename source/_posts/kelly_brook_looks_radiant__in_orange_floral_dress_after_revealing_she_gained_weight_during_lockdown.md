The voluptuous presenter, who previously insisted she wasn't worried about weight gain, has pinpointed dress sizes 10-12 as her ultimate goal after embarking on a new diet. 

Kelly is attempting to lose her lockdown weight by taking on the SlimFast challenge, with standard food portions replaced by two meal replacements, three 100-calorie snacks and one 500-calorie meal a day. 

Taking to social media for a Q&A on Tuesday, she insisted she was determined to reach her target having dropped two dress sizes during a previous attempt at dieting in March, again with the SlimFast plan. 

Responding to a fan, she wrote: 'I went from a Dress Size 14/16 to a 10/12. I'm curvy so I notice weight loss more in my clothes than on a scale.

'My target now is to get to a size 10/12 again as during lockdown I had some pounds creep back on!' 

When asked how quickly it takes to see positive results, she added: 'Usually in my clothes after a week! After lockdown I really wanted to get back into my jeans and dresses so I always notice a change when they start feeling loose and less tight.' 

Kelly's latest appearance on social media comes after she admitted she's 'not worried' about her weight creeping up because she always has her SlimFast plan to fall back on. 

She also insisted 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation' after revealing she spent much of lockdown preparing meals in the home she shares with boyfriend Jeremy Parisi.

She told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
