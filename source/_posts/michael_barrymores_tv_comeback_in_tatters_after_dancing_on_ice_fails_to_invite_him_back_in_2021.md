Michael Barrymore's hopes for a big TV comeback have been dashed as Dancing On Ice have reportedly failed to ask him back for the new series.

The TV legend, 68, was previously signed up to take part in the 2020 series, but he was forced to withdraw after breaking his wrist in training.

It was hoped that he would be asked to have another try in 2021 when the ITV show returns in January, but it's since been reported that he will not be part of the star-studded line-up.

According to The Sun, Michael has been informed that he won't be invited to join the new series.

A source told the publication: 'Michael was the landmark signing for 2020, and ITV were delighted to get him on board.

'When he got injured, they were keen for him to have another crack, and said so both publicly and privately.

'Something has changed since then, as they have said he’s not back for 2021 despite him being free and keen, and them hinting he would be.'

MailOnline have contacted representatives of Michael and Dancing On Ice for comment.  

It is said that the Channel 4 documentary Barrymore: Body In The Pool, which aired earlier this year, didn't help his cause.

Michael's career was devastated when Stuart Lubbock, a guest at a party in his home, was found dead in his swimming pool in 2001. No one was ever charged with the death of the 31-year-old.

After the revelation of Lubbock's death, and Michael being released without charge by police, ITV terminated his contract and his career subsequently collapsed. 

The star appeared on Piers Morgan's Life Stories last year and spoke about Mr Lubbock's tragic death and the fallout from it.

He said: 'Since Life Stories went out, I feel like it is the right time and right place but it is not for me to decide. I can't give myself work.'

Following his injury in December and subsequent exit from the show, the Strike It Lucky host was replaced by Blue Peter presenter Radzi Chinyanganya.

Taking to Instagram after the news broke, Michael penned: 'Took a nasty fall on the ice last Friday during rehearsals and sadly broke my left wrist...

'Absolutely devastated to hear that I can’t go on back on the ice for a while. Really enjoyed every single moment of being part of the terrific show and working with all the incredibly talented people involved x'.

Speaking during a later on This Morning, he continued: 'Unfortunately the medics have told me I can’t compete. I have loved every second of the journey so far. The support from the public has been overwhelming.' 

During his heyday, Michael was one of the most popular stars ion television and hosted numerous prime time shows including My Kind Of People and Strike It Rich.

This year's Dancing On Ice line-up so far includes musician and radio host Myleene Klass, Emmerdale actor Joe-Warren Plant, TV personality Denise Van Outen and former Coronation Street actress Faye Brooks.
