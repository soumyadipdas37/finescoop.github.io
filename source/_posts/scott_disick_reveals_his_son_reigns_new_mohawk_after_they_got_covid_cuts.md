His son Reign recently cut off his long hair after years of letting it grow.

Now Scott Disick has revealed his five-year-old son's newest hairdo —  a short mohawk.

The 37-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star also showed off his new shorter cut in a sweet father and son photo posted late Saturday night to his Instagram. 

Time for a change: Scott Disick, 37, revealed his new shorter hair and showed off his son Reign's new Mohawk in an Instagram post from late Saturday night

Scott rocked a teal Hawaiian shirt and looked cool in a set of black sunglasses while keeping his shorter hair slicked back.

Reign was shirtless in the photo, which was taken just above the beach, and tilted his head down to show off his eye-catching 'do.

Scott simply captioned the photo, 'Covid cuts.'

Though the mohawk hairstyle is often associated with the Mohawk people of North America, it's closer to hairstyles worn by the Pawnee people of the Central Plains.

Some critics consider white people wearing the haircut to be a form of cultural appropriation, though it has also been documented in Europe going back hundreds of years before the Common Era.

New hair: Scott wrote that the two got 'Covid cuts' in his caption. For years, he and his ex Kourtney Kardashian let Reign grow his hair out

Saying goodbye: Scott's new makeover follows news that his longtime series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be ending in 2021 after airing its 20th season; shown in October 2019

Scott's new makeover follows news that his longtime series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be ending in 2021 after airing its 20th season.

'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians,' the Kardashian–Jenner family wrote in a statement.

'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years — through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children,' they continued.

'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.' 

Minority party: Scott began appearing on KUWTK with his ex Kourtney Kardashian in 2007. He and Khloé Kardashian wanted to keep the show going, according to Page Six; shown in 2007

According to Page Six, the family was 'divided' into two camps on whether or not to end the show, with only Scott and Khloé Kardashian looking to continue filming.

Kim Kardashian, her husband Kanye West, and her younger sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner all supported bringing the series to an end after deciding the show wasn't the best 'money-making strategy' for them.  

The source added that the two holdouts saw KUWTK as an 'easy and reliable payday.'

'Some of them needed the money more than others,' they added, though both Scott and Khloé are believed to be multimillionaires.

Splitsville: Scott and Sofia Richie split following his brief rehab stay in May, though they were rumored to have reunited in July after spending Independence Day together; shown in April 2019

Scott first began appearing on the series with his then-partner Kourtney Kardashian in 2007, though they would later separate in 2015.

In addition to Reign, the former couple share their older son Mason, 10, and their daughter Penelope, eight. 

The former model most recently dated Sofia Richie, 22, beginning in 2017, though they separated following his short stay at a rehab facility in May of this year.

The couple seemed to have reunited over the summer after spending time together on the Fourth of July, but the relationship ended shortly afterward.

More recently, Scott has been spending time with his ex Kourtney and their children.

Since his split, Scott has been spending more time with his ex Kourtney and their three children: Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, six
