A Facebook page run by the violent Rose City Antifa group based in Portland is still up and running on the social media platform despite a pledge by CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month to clamp down on such extremist organizations.  

Facebook has adjusted its policy towards Dangerous Individuals and Organizations and had promised to 'address organizations and movements that have demonstrated significant risks to public safety.'

In August, the social media giant outlined specific ways in how it planned to take action against movements and organizations linked to violence and set about removing far-left groups associated with violence, yet the Rose City Antifa group is still up and running on the website which has billions of users.

Rose City Antifa's own website admits the group is 'sometimes' dangerous and warns its more than 23,000 members to be discreet when planning criminal activity.

'DO NOT discuss criminal activity or make any action plans on our Facebook wall. You should never make plans with a stranger on Facebook to do this work. Even trying to sort out ride shares, or similar is very unsafe on here. Undoubtedly enemies will fish around with posts of that nature so be wary,' the page cautions members of the group.  

As the world's largest social network, with more than 2 billion users, Facebook aims to support a global platform for free expression while sustaining a forum where its community of users feel welcomed, but in August, Zuckerberg pledged to remove violent threats and posts celebrating hate crimes.

'We're watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm. We won't always be perfect, but you have my commitment that we'll keep working to make Facebook a place where everyone can feel safe,' he said.  

His promise comes amid a wave of action by technology companies to more assertively police controversial speech and the social network is known to have removed several pages devoted to white nationalism.

'Facebook vowed to crack down on political violence and election interference, but the result is far less than advertised. The platform allows Antifa organizations to organize and share content in apparent conflict with Facebook's official policies,' Alexander Hall of the Media Research Center, a politically conservative content analysis group, wrote in a report on Thursday. 

Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to remove violent threats and groups celebrating or promoting violence with many far-right taken down

'MRC TechWatch sent an extensive report to Facebook about the activities of Rose City Antifa... Facebook didn't respond,' Hall wrote. 'Rose City Antifa's alleged reputation for political violence has been reported on by Politico, The Washington Times, and The Washington Post.

'Antifa organizations are known for violence. News reports about Rose City Antifa help make it one of the most public examples because of its social media presence,' Hall wrote. 

Portland has so far endured more than 100 days of demonstrations against racism and police brutality with many of the protestors part of antifa groups. 

The city's Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, has been fiercely criticized by Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist activists that have been in the streets since the death of George Floyd, the African-American man who died gasping for air under the knee of a white police officer in late May in the city of Minneapolis.
