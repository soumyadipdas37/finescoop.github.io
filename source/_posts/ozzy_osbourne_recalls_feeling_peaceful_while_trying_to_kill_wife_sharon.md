She has stuck by her rocker husband through thick and thin. 

And Sharon Osbourne even stuck by Ozzy Osbourne after he tried to KILL her during an out-of-control drug binge in 1989. 

The Black Sabbath star, 71, 'calmly' choked his wife, 69, and was arrested for her attempted murder, which he divulges in the documentary, The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, which airs on Sunday in America.

According to The Sun, Sharon relived the moment she had a brush with death at the hands of her husband, 31 years ago. 

The couple share three children together, Kelly, 35, Aimee, 37, and Jack, 34, and she recalled bathing them and putting them to bed before indulging in some light reading, moments before the attack. 

According to Sharon, Ozzy then entered the room and sat across from her on a sofa, but she didn't recognise her husband as his demeanour was completely different.

She recalled: 'He goes to a stage where he gets that look in his eyes, the shutters were down and I just couldn't get through to him and he just said, 'We've come to a decision that you've got to die".

The terrifying moment took Sharon by surprise and before she had time to defend herself, Ozzy had lunged across the chair and began to throttle her. 

Despite the incredible violence of the attack, she described him as 'very calm' as he pinned her down on the ground.

Not knowing what to do, Sharon managed to scramble and press a panic button in the room. Before she knew it, police officers had arrived at the property. 

According to the red-haired star, it was concern for the safety of their children that carried her through his brutal rampage.

She added: 'All I could think of was the kids. 'There's no way I'm leaving my kids.' So it was probably the most frightened that I had ever been.' 

He described the incident: 'I felt the calmest I had ever felt in my life. I was just peaceful. It's not exactly one of my greatest achievements'

Despite the staggering danger of the situation, Ozzy felt tranquil throughout the whole ordeal.

He said: 'I felt the calmest I had ever felt in my life. I was just peaceful. It's not exactly one of my greatest achievements.'

The rocker woke up in Amersham jail with limited recollection of the events that transpired, and he was informed by a policeman that he had been arrested for attempted murder. 

Decisions: The rocker was sent to treatment for six months where had the opportunity to reflect on the severity of his actions and Sharon could decide if she wanted to stick by him

He was subsequently sent to treatment for six months where he had the opportunity to reflect on the severity of his actions and Sharon could decide if she wanted to walk away from their marriage.

 Sharon recalled saying to him after the attack: 'I don't want the money but if you do this again, either I am going to kill you or you are going to kill me. And do you want that for the kids?'

Fortunately, the couple managed to move past the traumatic incident and have been married for a whopping 38 years.

It hasn't been a bed of roses, as the famous pair have faced many hurdles including his multiple infidelities and long-standing battle with drugs. 

 Ozzy also revealed earlier this year that he has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. 

The Black Sabbath frontman said he is currently taking antidepressants as his mental health took a decline following the diagnosis and the coronavirus pandemic.

Ozzy said the medication is doing 'wonders' and he has been advised to start meditating by his therapist, as he comes to terms with one of the biggest challenges of his life.
