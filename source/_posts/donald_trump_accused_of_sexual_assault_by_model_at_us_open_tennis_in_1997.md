A former model has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her at the US Open tennis championship 23 years ago.

Amy Dorris said she felt 'sick' and 'violated' after the alleged incident outside the bathroom in his VIP box at the tournament in New York on September 5, 1997.

Trump denies the claim.  

In an interview with The Guardian, Dorris, who was 24 at the time, accuses Trump of forcing his tongue down her throat, assaulting her all over her body and holding her in a grip she was unable to escape from.

'He just shoved his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him off. And then that's when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything.

'I was in his grip, and I couldn't get out of it, she said. 'I don't know what you call that when you're sticking your tongue just down someone's throat. But I pushed it out with my teeth. I was pushing it. And I think I might have hurt his tongue.'

Trump's lawyers has denied 'in the strongest possible terms' that the president ever harassed, abused or behaved improperly toward Dorris.
