Jadon Sancho will leave Borussia Dortmund in the future but the Bundesliga club will not be selling him this season, according to director Sebastian Kehl. 

The England international is the subject of interest from Manchester United, who missed Dortmund's August 10 deadline earlier this year to sign the 20-year-old. 

While club director Kehl has reiterated that Sancho will be remaining in Signal Iduna Park for the 2020-21 season, he did confess that the Dortmund star could be moved on in the near future.

Kehl told Ruhr Nachrichten: 'Jadon has trained well and professionally. He is happy to play football.

'Yes, someday he might leave for a new challenge but right now he is happy at Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Dortmund is happy to have him.

'He is here – and he will stay here. It was an important statement from the club because we have a certain responsibility. Without Jadon, this team is worse.'

Sancho was in red-hot form for Dortmund last season, scoring 20 goals and registering 20 assists in all competitions as the Bundesliga side finished as runners-up in the German top-flight.

He has begun the new season in similar fashion, scoring in Dortmund's 5-0 thrashing of MSV Duisburg in the German Cup last week before making an assist in the 3-0 Bundesliga win over Borussia Monchengladbach on the weekend. 

The Englishman's recent goalscoring form has seen his value shoot up over the past 12 months, with Dortmund quoting him at around £108million. 

The German side have a history of signing players at a young age before moving them on when their market price inflates.

Ousmane Demebele, Christian Pulisic and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have all been moved on to Europe's top clubs via this strategy, which has raised money for other young signings such as Sancho, Jude Bellingham and Erling Braut Haaland. 

Sancho arrived at Dortmund and a 17-year-old in 2017 from Manchester City in a move which cost the Bundesliga giants just £8million. 

The winger has scored 30 goals in 79 Bundesliga matches while he has also been capped 13 times by Gareth Southgate's England, scoring twice.
