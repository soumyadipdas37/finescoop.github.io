A savvy Australian woman has shared how she created a chic indoor macrame bench seat by combining Kmart products together.

Posting to the Kmart Hacks and Décor Facebook group, Michelle said she was after a 'quick, easy way' to make a stylish macrame bench seat, so she bought a $59 timber seat and three $4 macrame placemats from Kmart.

'I hand stitched the placemats together to create the macrame top and used a piece of foam cut to size with a handmade calico cover,' she said online.

Once the placemats were stitched together and the foam cushion was measured, Michelle used a staple gun to secure the material in place.

By sewing the cheap mats together gives the illusion that one long piece of material was used. 

The DIY project itself is very easy to complete and others can replicate the process at home too.  

The trendy look matches Michelle's bohemian style décor as she has other rattan, wooden and raffia items, which she made herself.

'There are more hacks that I've made in this photo too such as the raffia mirror, raffia wreath, crocheted dahlia cushion, rug trim and rope basket,' she said. 

The creative hack quickly received attention from other social media users part of the online Facebook community who were very impressed with the easy DIY project
