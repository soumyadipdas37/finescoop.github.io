Spain's Costa del Sol will close its beaches to tourists after 9.30pm every night as part of a package of new measures to halt the spread of coronavirus.  

Weddings will have their capacity slashed while tourist entertainment will be restricted and visits to retirement homes will be stopped if there is even one new case. 

The new regulations were approved today and will apply throughout the region of Andalusia, which includes Malaga and the Costa del Sol region, as well as eight other holiday districts such as Almeria, Cadiz, Seville and Granada.

There is particular concern about the second wave of the virus hitting Malaga, where hospital admissions continue to rise and another death was reported on Monday.

On Monday, 308 new cases were detected in Malaga province, the highest number so far.

Malaga currently has 151 virus patients in hospital, 12 more than on Sunday, of whom 19 are in the intensive care unit, two more than the previous day. 

There have been 298 deaths in Malaga since the start of the pandemic.

The local government said the coronavirus safety rules had to be tightened with immediate effect on the advice of medical experts. 

In the last 24 hours, there have been 955 positives in Andalusia, an increase of 3.2 per cent. Of these 76 people are in hospital. 

Spokesman Elias Bendodo said 'the aim is to make sure the pandemic evolves in Andalusia better than in the rest of Spain'. 

'Although cases are increasing, the community is well below the Spanish average,' she said.

Andalusia has registered 103 cases per 100,000 people in the last 14 days - only half the figure for Spain as a whole (206). 

Nonetheless, all beaches will now have to close at 9.30pm and cannot reopen until 7am in the morning in a bid to stop parties.

All the coastal resorts on the Costa del Sol are being ordered to enforce the new rule.

Weddings, celebrations and events will see their capacity reduced from 300 people to a maximum of 150 when held outdoors. 

If they are indoors, the maximum attendance will be reduced from 250 to 100 and celebrations will have to finish by 1am.  

Guests will have to be seated at tables of no more than 10 people, and food and drink can only be eaten at these tables.  

Other events such as conferences and trade fairs can go ahead but with 75 per cent capacity and compulsory masks.   

Meanwhile, group classes and children's activities that are offered to tourists will have a maximum capacity of 15 people.    

The new rules also cover retirement homes, with visits to be totally suspended if there is just one confirmed coronavirus cases or three suspected cases.
