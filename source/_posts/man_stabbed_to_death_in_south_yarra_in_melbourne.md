His attacker fled the scene.

A nearby housing complex has been cordoned off with specialist officers at the scene.

Meanwhile, a man is in custody following an earlier alleged stabbing in the city's southeast, at Frankston.

Emergency services were called to Petrie Street about 12.05am where they found a 35-year-old man with a laceration to his neck.

He was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition.

Police attended a nearby address and arrested a 38-year-old man who was assisting officers with their inquiries.

Investigators believe the two men are known to each other.
