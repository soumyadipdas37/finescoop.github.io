She overhauled her lifestyle after giving birth to her first child in 2018 and dropped two stone with an intense exercise plan. 

And Katie Waissel showcased the fruits of her labour as she displayed her washboard abs while out on an energetic run in London on Monday.

The former X Factor star, 34, looked incredible as she slipped her gym honed figure into a lilac crop top and dark green shorts for  the exercise session.

Katie paired her ensemble with black trainers and held onto her mobile phone as she ran.

The TV personality was full of concentration as she worked up a sweat while listening to music on her AirPods, at one point stopping to stretch against a wall. 

Katie left her brunette tresses to cascade down her back, while she appeared to go make-up free for the outing.

Last month, Katie showed off her toned physique in a candid Instagram post where she discussed the importance of finding time to train her body as a single mother.

The star looked incredible in simple grey Calvin Klein lingerie as she documented her postpartum fitness journey, stating: 'I didn't have my son and then wake up like this.'

Katie opened up about her experiences as she responded to a question asking how she manages to find time to train as a single mum.

The singer shared a snap of herself in her underwear as she showed off her trim physique, writing over the picture: 'You don't 'find time' you 'make time' - me, as soon as my son goes to sleep.'

She then shared a lengthy post in which she explained how she worked hard at her fitness following the birth of her son and said that it wasn't an instant transformation.

She penned: 'Q U E S T I O N - 'As a single mom, how do you find the time to train? If I was given money every time I have been asked this question, I'd be a very rich lady!

'But all humor aside, I have recently found myself deep in thought about this question! Finding time vs making time - wanting and willing to make a change vs continuing a pattern of procrastination.'

Referring to her lingerie-clad image, she said: 'This is me two years post partum. I didn't have my son and then wake up like this, I have worked hard and enjoyed the process of the ebs and flows of a forever lifestyle change, most days are great, some are not, but hey that is life.

'It poses the bigger question then of why are we so insistent that a change needs to be instant? I too have experienced the impatient feeling of 'I wish it would happen right now, right this second' but sometimes a reset, a restore, a rebuild, in whatever it is that we are looking to change doesn't happen overnight.'

The singer then went on to give words of encouragement to her fans and urged them to make their own attainable goals.

She said: 'Tonight, I would love to encourage you to think of a goal of yours, see it, believe it, envisage it, and then tell yourself it is 100000% achievable. Set your end goal and work your way backwards with your HOW. 

'Break it down into small achievable parts, conquer them, and build your courage strength and confidence! Before you know it, you would have surpassed that end goal 10 fold and be onto your next one. 

'Point in fact, don't FIND time, MAKE time. BELIEVE IN YOU!'

Katie has often been open about her body transformation and had previously shared before and after snaps of her figure. 

Back in May, she revealed that after seeing her before picture, she vowed to rebuild her 'physical strength' for the sake of her son.
