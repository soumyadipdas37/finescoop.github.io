She's the former journalist, skincare entrepreneur and author who has just released a new children's book, called Back to Sleep. 

And this week, Zoë Foster Blake was interviewed by comedian and TV star husband Hamish Blake in a bid to promote the book. 

The pair appeared in a hilarious clip together from their Melbourne home, which showed Hamish pretending to be a TV host and asking rather outlandish questions for 'click bait.'  

'Have you had fillers and what celebrity do you hate?' Hamish Blake hilariously interviewed wife Zoë Foster Blake this week, in a bid to promote her new children's book

'Zoë, real name?' Hamish began, as the pair started laughing together.  

'Celebs write books sometimes, what celeb do you hate? Who is the worst celeb you've kissed?' he went on, as Zoë hilariously glared at him.   

'In this book there's a house that they live in. How much does your house cost? Got any fillers?' he went on. 

Cheeky: 'In this book there's a house that they live in. How much does your house cost? Got any fillers?' Hamish asked his wife

Zoë quipped back, saying: 'No, no fillers. I don't have my lips done. Haven't had my hair or nails done in months.'

At another point, Zoë asked if he'd like to hear more about her book, when he jokingly replied: 'I think I've got the gist.' 

Her new book is a tongue-in-cheek children's book about a young child who tries to go to sleep, but is being constantly woken up by his parents.

She joked on Instagram about the mock interview, saying: 'Since Covid and lockdown decimated my press tour, I was forced to appear on the only show I could: the one Hamish created in my house. What a pity.'

On Tuesday's episode of The Project, the 40-year-old was asked the most outrageous way the couple have been woken up in the middle of the night by their children, Sonny, six, and Rudy, three.

The beauty guru and bestselling author recalled how Rudy once alerted Hamish, who is arachnophobic, to a spider in the bathroom.

'Rudy recently woke up my husband saying there was a spider in the bathroom, and he should come and see it for a shock,' Zoë told guest panellist Annika Smethurst.

'He is arachnophobic, so that was a wake-up call for him!' she continued.

Zoë also revealed how Sonny once interrupted the couple watching a violent show on television, informing them of a hair clip he had found in his bed. 

In an interview with The New York Times in March, Zoë, who is also the founder of skincare line Go-To, admitted that it can be hard juggling work and motherhood.

'I have a nanny who helps me three days a week, because if I didn't have those three days to work, I couldn't do any of this,' she said.

'My husband and I are a good team as well. I don't have an answer,' Zoë continued.

'I'm scattered and I get anxious and I get stressed like everybody. The best thing that I can do is compartmentalise.'
