Cheyenne Tozzi has walked the runways of the biggest fashion houses in the world. 

But the 31-year-old proved she's just like the rest of us when she showed a pristine white chair that was vandalised by her toddler daughter, Dahlia. 

Taking to Instagram, single mother Cheyenne appeared to laugh off the incident as she showed her followers the scribbled back of the chair.

Her daughter had gotten a green pen and drawn a number of squiggly lines. 

'Thanks Dahlia,' Cheyenne wrote on the post. 

Cheyenne didn't worry about posting a photo of the adorably guilty youngster.

The Australian model shares Dahlia with male model Marlon Teixiera, with the pair splitting soon after she gave birth in 2018. 

Cheyenne wrote a stunning tribute to her daughter back in May, while speaking about being a single mother.  

'My little love, safe to say I was terrified to bring you into this world,' Cheyenne wrote next to a dreamy photo of herself and Dahlia silhouetted against a beach.

'You saved my life': Cheyenne shared a heartfelt tribute to daughter Dahlia De La Lune, one, (pictured together) as she marked Mother's Day as a single parent in May 

'Not sure if I was going to be able to protect you and make sure you would be the happiest little girl. You have changed my world. You taught me how to love more than I could ever imagine,' the doting mother continued.  

'You saved my life. You show me unconditional love. You break my balls,' she joked. 

'You make me laugh, Sometimes cry at 4am, but that doesn't matter because every single day is worth it. Because I have you.'   

Motherly love: The besotted mother thanked her 'guardian angels' for 'sending Dahlia' to her, before joking that the adorable youngster is the only person she'll 'allow to pee on the floor' 

Cheyenne and Marlon debuted their relationship in August 2017, after being introduced by their mutual friend Jordan Barrett.

They welcomed their daughter Dahlia De La Lune, in September 2018.

Cheyenne previously confirmed to The Daily Telegraph's Confidential that the pair split shortly after she gave birth.
