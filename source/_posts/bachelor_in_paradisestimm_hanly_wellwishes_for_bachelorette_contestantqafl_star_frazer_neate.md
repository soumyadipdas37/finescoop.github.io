Frazer Neate caught the eye of Bachelorette Elly Miles in a new trailer for the show, which was shared this week. 

And it appears the 27-year-old already has friends in reality circles, with Bachelor in Paradise star Timm Hanly sending him well-wishes. 

On Tuesday, Timm, who starred on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette, shared an Instagram Stories posting showing an image of Frazer in the trailer.

The 27-year-old captioned that photo: 'Strap yourself in brother!' implying that they are close pals. 

It's unclear how the pair know one another, but Frazer is something of a famous face, with an award-winning career in the QAFL (Queensland Australian Football League). 

The footy player, from Mount Gravatt, Queensland, won the J.A. Grogan Medal in September last year.  

The medal is awarded to the the best and fairest player in each season's QAFL and Queensland State League competition.

Upon winning the medal, Frazer was described by the QAFL website as being his usual humble self.   

'I didn't think I would win. I honestly didn't expect this to happen so I'm really proud of myself and the Mt Gravatt boys,' he said at the time.  

While Frazer has scarce online presence and has locked down his social media, an old MySpace account, which appears to have been last updated when the athlete was in high school, lists troubled AFL star Ben Cousins as one of his heroes.
