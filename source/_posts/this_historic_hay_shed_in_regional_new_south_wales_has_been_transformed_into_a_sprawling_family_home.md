An enormous farmyard hay shed in regional New South Wales has been transformed into a sprawling family home that looks like it's been plucked straight from the pages of an architecture magazine.

Built in the 1880s, the historic building 30 minutes' drive north of Newcastle now houses six large bedrooms, two bathrooms and an adjoining garage with parking space for four cars.

The 120-year-old house, christened 'Vintage Steel', has been described as 'country Australia's answer to the trendy inner-city warehouse conversion'.

More than 20 tonnes of exposed steel beams and five tonnes of timber panels have been used throughout the house which is floored with polished concrete, filling every inch with a sense of industrial luxury.

'Vintage Steel', a sprawling six-bedroom family home in regional New South Wales that started life as a farmyard hay shed

A living room fitted with a custom fireplace and a sleek kitchen built around an island benchtop are spread across 316 square metres - 96 bigger than the average floor size of a New South Wales home which sat at 220.3sqm in 2018, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Hints of the building's rustic past remain, with timber panels on feature walls and distressed 'farmhouse' doors leading into the bedrooms.

Those agricultural-inspired features are cleverly contrasted with modern fixtures like stainless steel tapware and ornate hanging lamps in the bathroom.

At the heart of the home is a custom-built wood heater which can be used as a restaurant-style pizza oven, the property description reveals.

Sustainability was prioritised in the redesign of the hay shed, which is now doubly insulated and powered by an energy-efficient hot water system.

Outside, a beautifully manicured garden surrounds the house with an additional six outdoor parking spaces on one side – providing ample space for visitors or clients for anyone inclined to turn the unique property into a commercial business.

Agent Scott Hunter from top real estate agency Ray White said the former hay shed has been attracting keen interest since it was listed for sale at auction on Saturday, September 5.

Mr Hunter told realestate.com.au he has been 'inundated with inquiries' and welcomed more than 80 groups at the first open house.

He expects the house to fetch somewhere in the region of $1million (AUD) when it's eventually snapped up by the right buyer.
