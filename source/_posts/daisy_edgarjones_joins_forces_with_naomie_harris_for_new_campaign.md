Daisy Edgar-Jones has joined forces with Naomie Harris and Fearne Cotton in a stunning new photoshoot to encourage the public to get involved in Macmillan Cancer Support’s flagship Coffee Morning fundraising event.

The  event takes place on Friday, September 25, with the celebrities giving up their time to take part in a socially distanced photo series by photographer Tom Oldham.

Daisy, 22, looked radiant as ever for the shoot as she posed on a picnic blanket under a tree in Cardiff, Wales.

The Normal People star cut a casual figure in the snap, donning a blue top with skinny jeans and a pair of black boots. 

Styling her brunette locks into an updo, the actress completed her look with a pair of gold hoop earrings.  

James Bond star Naomie was photographed in North London and looked sensational in a white sleeveless dress with a floral print.

The actress, 44, posed on a black chair and styled her raven locks into a high ponytail for the shoot.

Meanwhile, TV presenter Fearne was pictured taking a break from work in a recording studio. 

The former Celebrity Juice star, 39, opted for a laid back look for the shoot, sporting a black printed T-shirt with matching skinny jeans and black trainers. 

Daisy shot to fame for her role as Marianne in Normal People, where she starred opposite Paul Mescal as two Irish college students who fall in love.

Previously discussing her role in the series with Harper's Bazaar, she said: 'I'm really proud of it. It's so raw and honest. 

'We're not just seeing a glossy, honeymoon portrayal of love, we're seeing the rust of life. It's the truth of growing up.'

Speaking about her sex scenes with Paul, who portrayed Connell in the series, she insisted: 'It was about creating a real friendship with Paul so we could trust each other.

'I'm lucky he and I understand each other and have a very similar sense of humour. Neither Paul nor I are ever sexualised in those moments. It's just a story of young love.'

Daisy confessed that when she landed the role of Marianne in Normal People, she was struck with Imposter Syndrome.

She said: 'It was bl**dy terrifying. When I got the part, I was very excited. Then I had the fear settle in, the imposter syndrome of thinking, have they actually got it wrong?

'I learnt a lot during filming about being more confident in my voice and not feeling like I have to quieten it.'

Speaking about the upcoming fundraiser, Daisy said: 'Macmillan is always there for those of us who need support, and now more than ever they need our help to do their vital work.

'Having a Coffee Morning for Macmillan is a fun and easy way to raise money for a great cause and, even though this year things are a little different, it’s still important that we have a cuppa for Macmillan if we can, wherever we are, and give them our love and support.'

The stars’ support comes at the most critical time in Macmillan’s history, as it faces losing a third of its fundraising income due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

People can show their support in a series of different ways; whether by hosting a safe and socially distanced stall on their doorstep - adhering to coronavirus guidelines, organising a virtual get-together, taking on a fitness challenge or by donating and Raising a Mug for a selfie online. 

People can also join in by buying one of the limited-edition M&S products or having a personal coffee morning at an M&S café where a 5p donation from every hot coffee and slice of cake in September goes to Macmillan.
