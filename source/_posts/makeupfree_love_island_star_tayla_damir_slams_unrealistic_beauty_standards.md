Love Island Australia's inaugural winner Tayla Damir has slammed Instagram filters for 'setting unrealistic expectations for women'.

The makeup-free TV star, 24, shared a dramatic before-and-after filter transformation on Friday to demonstrate her point to fans.  

'It's sad to think that young girls have to feel like they must look like a perfect filter to be seen as "insta pretty"... it's not reality!' Tayla said in a lengthy post.

To showcase how far filters can alter a person's appearance, Tayla shared two selfies with clear differences.

'The filter has gone and given me a nose job, lip job, cheek filler, a different eye colour and changed the complexion if my skin,' she wrote on the first image using the 'pure baby face' filter on Instagram. 

Tayla continued: 'It's just too much and upsets me to think that there would be so many people who don't feel as confident in their own skin, because they see girls looking like this.'

The former beauty queen then shared another makeup-free selfie without the filter to show how the filter had changed her features.

'It's just a filter, not reality,' Tayla said, urging fans: 'Embrace yourself girls and don't fall victim to the smoke and mirror of social media.' 

In June, Tayla spoke candidly about her battle with Bell's palsy, a type of paralysis that affects one side of the face.

She cried to fans on Instagram Story as she revealed how a medical Botox procedure had worsened her condition, rather than improved it.

'I should've listened to my gut', Tayla said in the upload at the time.

She confirmed their relationship on January 1, sharing a picture of the pair kissing on a balcony that was aptly captioned: 'Happy New Year.'
