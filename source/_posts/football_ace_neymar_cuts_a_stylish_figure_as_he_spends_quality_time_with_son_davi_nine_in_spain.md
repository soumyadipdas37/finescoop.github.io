Paris St-Germain ace Neymar looked stylish as he enjoyed an idyllic yacht day with his young son Davi in Formentera, Spain on Sunday.

The football icon, 28, was every inch the devoted father as he held hands with his son, nine, who he shares with ex girlfriend Carolina Dantas, as they walked down the beach.

Neymar cut a casual cool figure in a white slogan print tee, paired with a bright yellow Supreme jacket as he enjoyed the day.

The Brazilian football star revealed his multiple leg tattoos in a pair of floral shorts, completing the ensemble with a black baseball cap and shades.

Adorable Davi showed he had inherited his father's flair for fashion in a pair of green seashell patterned shorts.

Taking precautions against COVID-19, the pair wore face masks as they walked on the beach.

The father-son duo later boarded a lavish yacht where they spent the day with family and friends.

The Brazilian is still coming to terms with an agonising defeat in the Champions League final last week, after his Paris Saint-Germain team were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich.

And Neymar, the world’s most expensive footballer, is now desperately trying to persuade his former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi to join him in Paris.

On Sunday, it was revealed Neymar has decided to end his £78.6million partnership with Nike after 15 years.

The striker's contract with the sportswear company will end on Monday, August 31, as reported by Brazilian outlet Diario do Peixe, with the pair unable to agree how much he would be paid for a renewal.

Neymar did not appear in their latest worldwide campaign, 'You Can't Stop Sport' which included Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo with a Nike spokesperson telling AFP he is no longer one of their athletes.  

Nike have sponsored the Brazilian since he was 13 years old, long before he became a professional. During his rise to stardom at Santos, they even supplied sports equipment for the club.

Neymar's switch of allegiances could be bad news for Paris Saint-Germain with Nike the club's kit supplier.

The French side had an increase in their contract after signing the megastar, receiving €70m (£62m) as a result of his world record transfer from Barcelona.

Neymar renewed his Nike contract after winning the Copa Libertadores in 2011 and the deal, worth a huge £78.6m, was reportedly set to end in 2022.

But the deal looks to have ended early and will have a big impact on the American company because of the striker's global appeal.

As well as PSG, Nike supply the kits of Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Tottenham and recently gained Premier League champions Liverpool.

They also sponsor some of the biggest stars in sport including Virgil van Dijk, Raheem Sterling, LeBron James, Serena Williams and Tiger Woods.
