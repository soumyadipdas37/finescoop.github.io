Her latest film Antebellum will be released on demand on Friday, rather than open as planned in theatres, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

And against the backdrop of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, Janelle Monae headlined a socially-distanced outdoor screening of the horror movie in Los Angeles on Sunday night.

Monae and several of her co-stars attended the event that took the form of a drive-in screening on the rooftop of a parking structure at The Grove shopping center.

Ahead of the screening, Monae, 34, posed for photos in a gorgeous full-length black gown.

She showed off her cleavage in the sleeveless number that featured a tight bodice, cinched waist and full skirt.

She accessorized with several choker necklaces, a pair of drop earrings and a black and white clutch purse. 

Joining Monae were castmembers Jack Huston, Kiersey Clemons and Jena Malone along with the film's writer/producer and director duo Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz.

She stepped out in black heels and wore her hair styled back from her face which was made  up with a splash of scarlet red lip color.

Huston, 37, also kept things relaxed, pairing a black t-shirt and black trousers with a dark red zipper jacket.

In Antebellum, Monae plays a modern-day woman transported back in time to a pre-Civil War plantation in the South.

The film follows her as she attempts to escape from the slavery she finds herself in and get back to her own time period, bringing other slaves with her.

At Sunday night's screening, Monae told Variety that the movie 'reminds us that the past is not the past.

She explained: 'The past is not even dead and I think the film is very timely and does a great job, an exceptional job of linking and connecting the dots of the past, the present and what could be our future.'

The actress added: 'I'm very honored to stand here and represent for Black women who have been dismantling white supremacy and systemic racism for centuries.'

Antebellum had originally been scheduled to open in theatres back in April but was postponed and then slated for video on demand due to the pandemic.
