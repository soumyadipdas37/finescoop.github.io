Flatmates who have earned $350,000 by selling gut health pills during the coronavirus lockdown share their future ambitions - as their customers share dramatic skin transformation photos. 

Reever Botha and Vlad Kosovac, both 25, launched PuraU in March 2020, just as Australians were ordered to stay home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

But the timing couldn't have been better for the business partners, who earned $25,000 in the first three weeks their product was on the market.

The PuraU three-part Gut Cleanse Kit supports natural cleansing and a healthy immune system, timely given the world is trying to restore itself to full health.

The pills - which are vegan and Australian made - can relieve acne, eczema, rosacea, bloating, indigestion, gassiness and gut inflammation.  

All PuraU products have been developed by a naturopathic and herbal expert and the goods were permitted for use by the TGA.

Customers have been coming forward to share their success stories on the pills, including 21-year-old Acacia Clarke from Brisbane, Queensland.

Keira Houldsworth, 25, also from Brisbane, said her 'three month pregnant belly of bloating' subsided and redness in her cheeks disappeared within two weeks of using the pills

'I wanted to heal the hormonal acne I had suffered from since I was 15 years old,' she told FEMAIL.

She saw results within the first 10 days of the cleanse and felt like she had 'completely new skin' after the gut cleanse finished on the 20th day.

'It has truly gotten me far better results than anything else I've tried,' she said.

'No matter what I was feeding my body, no matter how many times I changed my diet and eliminated certain food groups I would always end up with a bloated and sore stomach,' the young woman from Sydney said.

'Not only did PuraU have amazing ingredients that were backed up by research, but really thought about the planet with their packaging, everything is recyclable.'  

Mr Botha told FEMAIL previously that it was 'daunting' launching their Gut Cleanse Kit as the pandemic took hold, but the friend went on 'full steam ahead'.

'We're happy to say we launched through COVID,' he said. 'It was a shining light for us, e-commerce has boomed. People are at home and have the opportunity to buy things on their phone.'

Mr Kosovac said the global health crisis meant the business partners needed to refocus their launch plan.

'We initially said we need to work a lot smarter, use the pandemic as a strategy. It was about acing our marketing,' he said. After four months, the business made $250,000.  

It's been a 'stressful' road to success for the pair, who first met at a business seminar in Sydney.

Mr Botha had completed a Bachelor of Business Management at Queensland University of Technology and was attending seminars in the field.  

'I knew I wanted to have my own business, I didn't want to go down the corporate path,' he explained. The pair 'bonded' at the seminar and kept in contact for a couple of months.

They met for coffee in Brisbane and the rest is history. 'F*** it dude,' Mr Botha recalled. 'Let's start our business together'. 

The pair quickly decided to focus their product on digestion, as they are both passionate about health and fitness.   

'Our guts have been rotten our whole life. So that's one thing we're passionate about, so we thought let's smash it out of the park,' Mr Botha said.

Mr Kosovac, who is from Melbourne, then moved to Queensland to live with Mr Botha in his parents' Brisbane home. 

While he misses Melbourne, Mr Kosovac said he would have moved anywhere for the benefit of the business.

'I've got to do what's best for the business. It didn't matter where,' he said. 

The business partners spent six months conducting research and developing a plan. They then found a manufacturer and received approval from Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). 

After four months, the business made $250,000. Pictured: Evelien Langeveld with the product 

'We're happy,' Mr Botha said. 'We spent a lot of time, money and effort for 12 months without seeing a return. 

'There were times when we wanted to give up. We're just happy we've stuck with it, we've done everything right.' 

The pair are now hoping to take their business into retail, with their sights set on Priceline.   

Mr Botha concluded: 'Throughout this pandemic, it's shown why people should be on top of their health.'
