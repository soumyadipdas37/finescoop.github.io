Grandmother-to-be Sarah Ferguson looked in high spirits today as she arrived at Venice airport - donning a very colourful face mask.

With her luggage trolley piled high with suitcases and a large gold gift bag, the Duchess of York, 60, may well have popped into a few baby shops during her visit to the Italian city. 

On Friday last week, her daughter Princess Eugenie, 30, announced she is expecting her first child with husband Jack Brooksbank, whom she married in October 2018.

Dressed in her vibrant green £1,600 Gucci blazer which she teamed with a black midi dress and pumps, Sarah waved as she entered the airport, with a stewardess pushing her trolley behind her.

The Duchess sported a rainbow face mask adorned with white unicorns and wore her flame red hair in a half-updo with her glasses on her head. 

Sarah appears to be a fan of this particular blazer when it comes to travelling, having worn it as she passed through Beijing Airport, during which she was videoed riding on a motorised scooter suitcase 

It is not known how long she spent in Venice, however Sarah shared a photograph of her in the back of a car on Sunday, possibly making her way to the airport. 

On Friday Buckingham Palace released a statement that read: 'Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and Mr Jack Brooksbank are very pleased to announce that they are expecting a baby in early 2021.

'The Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York, Mr and Mrs George Brooksbank, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted with the news.'

Ecstatic by the happy news, Sarah told Hello!: 'Soon to be Granny and Granddad are absolutely overjoyed!'

Prince Andrew's ex-wife has shown off her playful side during lockdown by donning costumes and crafting sets for her Fergie and Friends YouTube series, where she reads children's books aloud.

In recent weeks, she's been sharing glimpses of her cooking talents on her channel - including the likes of peanut butter toast-shaped bears and gingerbread men.

The mother-of-two is also a widely successful children's author, signing a seven-book deal earlier this year, and has been at the forefront of the Royal Family's response to the global crisis with her volunteering efforts

According to royal expert Camilla Tominey, the Duchess' reinvention amid the coronavirus lockdown has won over a new legion of fans.

'Like a sort of wonky Phoenix, rising from the flames of Andrew’s car crash Newsnight interview, Fergie appears to have turned a crisis into an opportunity by using the lockdown to reinvent herself,' said Camilla, writing for the Telegraph.
