A surfer has shared a chilling photo of her board following a close encounter with a shark just days after a longboarder was mauled to death at a nearby beach. 

Linda Marchant Sinclair has shared images on Facebook of what appeared to be a shark tooth lodged in her foil board. 

She said the attack happened while she was surfing at Cabarita, in northern NSW, on Wednesday.

Her close encounter has sparked a desperate warning to other surfers in the area.

'Don't go surfing at Caba Headland… Big shark attacked foil,' Ms Sinclair wrote.

Cabarita is 21.6km from Coolangatta, where real estate agent Nick Slater, 46, was killed on Tuesday last week.

His attack happened where swimmers are protected by shark netting. Mr Slater was among at least 40 surfers in the water when he was attacked and later succumbed to his injuries on the beach.

His death is only the second fatal shark attack at one of Queensland's 85 beaches that have been protected by nets and drum lines since 1962, the state government said. 

Three-time world surfing champion Mick Fanning surfed at nearby Snapper Rocks on the morning Mr Slater was fatally attacked.

The 39-year-old, who survived a shark attack in the final of the J Bay Open in South Africa in 2015, called for an update to Queensland's shark management strategies in the wake of Mr Slater's death.

Greenmount Beach has shark nets on the outside of the lineup, but Fanning said the incident proves the system needs to be upgraded.

'It's just a little bit outdated. We haven't revisited them for a long time. We see south of the border they have the smart buoys and tagged sharks get pinged and we can see where those sharks are via an app and I don't see why we shouldn't have that on the Gold Coast,' he told Courier Mail.

Fanning said Mr Slater's death had shocked the Gold Coast surfing community.

'We didn't think that it would happen so close and just the footage of it, it's horrific. Everyone is shaken up and our hearts go out to the Slater family and all his friends, it's just shocking,' he said.

Fanning suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and recurrent nightmares in the years after his shark incident.

Through his recovery, he started working with National Geographic on a two-part documentary called Save this Shark, which premiers on Tuesday.

In the film, Fanning speaks with world-leading shark scientists and conservationists to share a broader understanding of shark habits.

Fanning disagrees with culling sharks, which he believes is a knee-jerk response many take after an attack.

He said we need to do more study on shark patterns to learn to live in harmony with the ocean predators.

'We have to learn why it's happening. Why are we seeing so much more activity along here? That's what we need to find out rather than just going and slaughtering the ocean,' Fanning said.
