Emilio cut a casual figure in a white tee that had the phrase 'NYC Tough' written on it and a pair of navy blue joggers.

He completed his look with a pair of bright white sneakers and a standard wrist watch.

The Dawson's Creek alum looked overjoyed to be in the company of her younger lover, as she was grinning from ear to ear while they both gazed at one another with their face masks pulled down.

For the romantic embrace, Katie was dressed casually in light blue jeans and a tight-fitting grey top, while Emilio went simple in a pair of dark jeans and a navy shirt. 

He and Holmes first sparked rumors of romance when they were spotted on September 4 dining out. It's unclear when he and Katie met or started their romance.

It's certainly a surprise to see the actress put on such a public display of affection, as she has previously been notoriously private about her personal life.

The Mad Money actress was wed to Tom Cruise from 2006 to 2012. 

During that time they had daughter Suri, now 14, who is often seen accompanying mom around the Big Apple.

After that Katie began dating Jamie Foxx, who she was first linked to in 2013 when the pair was seen strolling hand in hand through Malibu. 

The pair never officially confirmed they were dating and by 2019 reports of a split began to emerge.

At the time insiders told People that the relationship had run 'its course,' explaining: 'This industry is very tough on relationships.'

They went on to say there were no bitter feelings between the pair, who simply grew apart.   

'Jamie thinks Katie is an incredible human being. They had a very, very deep connection,' the source said.

'They brought each other a lot of joy and laughter,' the insider continued about the pair, who were last seen together at the Met Gala in May of 2019 - their first and last red carpet as a couple.
