She is a successful actress and he is a blue-blooded aristocrat – so it’s good to learn that Cressida Bonas and new hubby Harry Wentworth-Stanley can be just as frugal as the rest of us.

The newlyweds shaved a bob or two off their dinner bill thanks to the Chancellor’s Eat Out To Help Out scheme. 

My exclusive snaps – the first we have seen of the couple since their secret wedding in July – show them enjoying a meal at trendy Granger & Co in London’s Notting Hill.

She and her husband, pictured, scaled back their wedding plans due to the Covid-19 pandemic

At one stage, Cressida, a former girlfriend of Prince Harry, showed off some rather theatrical gestures.

She recently revealed that she and Harry – the son of Marchioness of Milford Haven – were forced to scale back their wedding plans due to the pandemic. 

But with the holiday market in turmoil, at least they may be able to grab a honeymoon bargain!

It's a dog day for Helena

We all know that supermodel Helena Christensen is still in fabulous shape at 51 – but I’m not sure the same can be said for her two pet pooches.

Helena posted this picture of herself lounging on a boat on a serene lake near her home in upstate New York, where she has been spending lockdown with her 20-year-old son Mingus and pets.

‘A day on the lake just about does the trick,’ she told her 720,000 followers. Proof that this veteran of the 1990s supermodel troupe – whose members famously would not get out of bed for less than $10,000 – enjoys a simpler life these days.

It was one of the most exclusive selfie spots of all – but Annabel’s nightclub has now banned members from snapping pouty poses in its powder rooms. 

The loos were the only area where guests were allowed to take pictures after a £55 million club makeover – and 25,000 selfies were taken. But new rules forbid cameras anywhere in the club ‘including bathrooms’.
