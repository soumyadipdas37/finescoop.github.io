A new face serum that promises to leave skin looking years younger with the help of a powerful natural ingredient is so popular, one is selling every two minutes.

Developed by Australian skincare brand MooGoo, $34.90 Bakuchiol Serum promises all the anti-ageing benefits of classic retinol creams without the nasty side effects.

Retinol - the cosmetic name for vitamin A - is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but its potency can cause a plethora of harsh side effects from intense dryness to an increased risk of burning in the sun. 

Its high concentration of vitamin A has been linked to birth defects which makes it unsafe for use during pregnancy, which is why thousands of women are rushing to buy Moogoo's alternative, made with bakuchiol from the Indian babchi plant.

* Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles 

* Smooths skin tone and improves texture

* Firms skin by strengthening elasticity

Among them is Bosnian-born Miss Universe Australia Monika Radulovic, who is using the serum to treat her skin at five months pregnant.

The 30-year-old model said the retinol-substitute is 'perfect' for mums-to-be, providing visible anti-ageing results without the danger associated with vitamin A-rich products.

Mixed with natural ingredients like Jojoba Oil, vitamin E and shea butter, Bakuchiol Serum claims to smooth tone and texture, strengthen elasticity and wind back the clock on wrinkles, leaving skin with a radiance that defies its years.

The face oil only launched in mid-September but it's already become MooGoo's fastest-selling product in history, a result that's sure to please brand CEO Melody Livingstone.

Ms Livingstone said it took years to perfect the formula, but it's been worth the wait.

Bakuchiol is a vegan skincare ingredient derived from the leaves and seeds of the Babchi plant, which grows in India where the herb has long been used in herbal medicine and Ayurvedic healing practices.

It is a potent antioxidant that visibly reduces fine lines and wrinkles, lessens the severity of pigmentation and sun damage and smooths skin tone and texture.

Treatments infused with bakuchiol are suitable for all skin types but work best on dry, dehydrated skin. 

For best results, dermatologists recommend applying bakuchiol-laced products once or twice daily after cleansing, toning and moisturising.

Bakuchiol is best known as a natural alternative to retinol (vitamin A), a powerful anti-ageing compound that is notorious for harsh side effects.

Retinol can cause intense dryness on sensitive skin types, making them more susceptible to burn in the sun. 

It's also not safe to use during pregnancy, because excessive amounts can interfere with fetal development and lead to birth defects.

'We have been researching natural ingredients that pack the same anti-ageing punch as retinol, but without the negative effects,' she said. 

'Retinoids work by prompting surface skin cells to turn over and die rapidly, making way for new cell growth underneath. 

'They hamper the breakdown of collagen and thicken the deeper layer of skin where wrinkles begin, but can have nasty side effects, including burning, redness and irritation.'

Bakuchiol - pronounced bah-koo-chee-all - does all the good work of retinoids without those dangers, Ms Livingstone said.

For best results, a product description on the brand's website recommends applying the serum morning and night after cleansing, toning and moisturising. 

After 12 weeks of twice-daily application, users should see a 'significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity and firmness' without the undesirable effects typically associated with retinol.
