If you're looking for an inspiring read to ease yourself back into normality after lockdown, or if you ever feel too anxious to accomplish something, Born to be Mild: Adventures for the Anxious by Rob Temple should probably be top of your reading list.

Journalist and founder of the @SoVeryBritish Twitter account, the Very British Problems author's latest book is a wonderfully hilarious and life-affirming memoir. 

Published August 27, Born to Be Mild shares Rob's experiences as he sets out to reinvent himself as an intrepid traveller, a bee-keeper and yogi, all to become a little less Bear (Pooh) and a little more Bear (Grylls).

Much like all walks of life, there are good days and bad days, but with each failed adventure and small victories, Rob discovers how the mild-mannered and anxious can still enjoy their own share of (gentle) adventure from time to time.

Rob writes: 'A handful of years ago, I moved with my wife to a house on a quiet street in a quiet town and lay quietly in a room for a long time.

'I used to love an adventure, but when I hit my thirties I started to become afraid of the world, until I was too frightened to even go outside at all... it was just me, my phone and my social media feeds. Doesn't sound too healthy, does it? It wasn't.'

Born to Be Mild, which is available as a Kindle eBook, hardcover, and audiobook, has fast become an Amazon bestseller and so far boasts a perfect five-star average review rating. One shopper wrote in their review: 'I adored this book, it's my favourite of all the books I've read so far this year.

'It's very suited to reading during lockdown because it'll give you an appreciation of the small pleasant activities in life. It's brimful of humour and honesty and it has dark bits but also lots of hope and light.'

Another added: 'It feels like I was joining in his adventure with him and that was very much fun. This book is a very frank account of how he felt during his adventure after his difficult times.

'He expresses himself in an honest and touching way but which manages to be both frank and revealing, and witty and charming all at once. Every sentence stayed with me and made me giggle and laugh with myself all day.

'A great delivery in a comforting/familiar voice. I loved it!'
