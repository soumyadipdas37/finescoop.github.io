Former Bachelor Colton Underwood was spotted emerging from lockdown in Los Angeles this Wednesday early morning.

His sighting marked the first time the 28-year-old was seen out in public since his ex Cassie Randolph obtained a temporary restraining order against him.

Cassie, who won his hand on The Bachelor last year, split from him this spring and has accused him of stalking her and planting a tracking device on her car.

Colton stuck to a casual outfit in muted colors when he was glimpsed out and about this week, including a grey hoodie and black sweats.

He made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as he stepped out amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Later that same morning he could be seen out and about in a black hoodie with a metallic print that glittered in the sunlight.

He accessorized his ensemble with a dark baseball cap and took care to keep hydrated, bringing a water bottle with him on his walk.

Cassie was granted a temporary restraining order against him on September 14 stipulating he must stay at least 100 yards from her at all times.

He must also maintain the same amount of distance from her workplace or residence, according to TMZ.

Colton, who is also banned from contacting her or threatening her, can give his version of events at a hearing next October. 

When Cassie filed for a restraining order on September 11 she included pictures of a tracking device and insisted he taped it to her car's rear bumper.

Cassie, who dated the breakup to mid-April though it was announced in May, has claimed he confessed to putting the tracking device on her vehicle.

She has also accused him of turning up outside her family's home in Huntington Beach and her apartment in Los Angeles unasked, TMZ reported. 

The filing states Cassie's brother 'saw Mr. Underwood in the alley outside Ms. Randolph's bedroom window at two in the morning,' according to E! News.

Cassie's filing included screen-shots of text conversations with Colton, which E! News have obtained and quoted extensively.

On June 27 Colton's messages included: '...Because your a selfish person who isn't ready to be loved. I spent two years loving you the best I could and now I'm sitting here feeling like a fool... You've hurt me beyond words... I've always done nothing but be there for you and you still disrespect me all the time.'

When Cassie asked to know: 'What did I even do??' her ex replied: 'You hid things from me and been so shady,' only to follow up after some hours: 'I apologize for some of the things I said last night. I'm lost right now. I'm drowning.'

A month later, the filing alleged: 'Ms. Randolph's friend, Caelan, visited her at her apartment' - presumably her ex Caelan Tiongson.

'Mr. Underwood somehow immediately knew, and obsessively called and sent text messages to Ms. Randolph about the visit. Ms. Randolph was startled that he knew who was coming in and out of her apartment, and felt like she was being watched.'

Cassie's filing asserts that Colton arrived outside her apartment 'few days later' to shout: 'I am going to keep you accountable,' and that during this period he allegedly sent her texts to the tune of: 'I'm just sitting in bed trying to fall asleep wondering if the woman I'm madly in love with is having a good time with her ex.'

The Indiana-born reality star, who was famously a virgin before finding love with Cassie on The Bachelor, went into lockdown with her early in the pandemic.

He then came down with COVID-19 himself and was quarantined on a separate floor of her family's Huntington Beach home as Cassie cared for him.
