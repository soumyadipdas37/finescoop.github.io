An Argentinian MP has resigned his seat after being suspended for kissing a woman's breasts during an online parliamentary session.

Married father-of-three Juan Emilio Ameri shocked fellow lawmakers by letting a pretty blonde sit on his knee and appear to fondle him before bending down and kissing her right nipple after pulling down her black top.

Footage of the extraordinary moment led to the ruling Frente de Todos coalition in the north-west province of Salta expelling the 47-year-old pending an investigation and demanding his resignation as an MP.

Moments after the sex scene was played out on a large screen during a debate about provincial debt, fellow MPs unanimously voted in favour of Ameri's suspension after Chamber of Deputies president Sergio Massa halted the session.

A parliamentary commission was planning on determining the final sanction, with his expulsion as an MP being openly discussed.

But on Thursday night Ameri offered to step down.

Ameri, accused of sexually harassing a teenager around the time he first became an MP last December, initially tried to play down the incident with a bizarre explanation linking his behaviour to the woman's recent boob job after his suspension.

The blonde at the centre of the shocking episode has been named as Ameri's 'girlfriend and political advisor' Celeste Burgos after it emerged the MP had separated from his wife Alejandra Escudero.

He told a local radio station about the sex gaffe: 'My partner and I are really suffering because of this.

'I'm very ashamed about what happened and I'm very sorry.

'The internet connection in the area where I'm based is very bad.

'My partner was coming out of the bathroom when I thought the connection had gone.

'Ten days ago she had breast enlargement and I asked her about her silicone implants.

'I asked her if I could give her a kiss and I kissed her on the boobs. That was it.'

In a statement he sent on Thursday night to Mr Massa after initially refusing to resign his seat, he said: 'I'm offering my resignation as an MP.

'I'd like to offer my apologies for what happened. It wasn't my intention to demonstrate this lack of respect.'

Salta senator Nora del Valle Gimenez, announcing the decision of the Frente de Todos coalition which Ameri represents in Argentina's equivalent of the House of Commons to suspend him ahead of his quit decision, said: 'We are expelling Juan Ameri immediately following his serious misconduct during a parliamentary session.

'We are also asking him to resign his seat as a representative of the coalition.'

Mr Massa, one of a handful of MPs thought to have been in Argentina's Lower House when the incident occurred, added: 'During the online sessions that have been taking place, a situation occurred that is totally at odds with the normal decorum of this House.

'We have experienced situations over the past few months in which an MP fell asleep during one remote session but this is an incident that goes well beyond the normal House rules.

In June a Spanish councillor was criticised after taking part in a Zoom council meeting from a sun lounger on the beach.

Paola Moreno turned heads by opting to appear on camera with her head resting on a towel and her eyes hidden behind shades.

Mrs Moreno, deputy mayoress and finance councillor in the Costa del Sol resort of Torrox east of Malaga, was accused at the time of damaging the local authority's image by the rival left-wing PSOE party.

She responded by claiming she was at the beach because of a promise she had made to her children after they had been banned for so long because of the Spanish Covid-19 lockdown - and insisted she was able to focus 100 per cent on what was being said because her husband took charge of the kids.
