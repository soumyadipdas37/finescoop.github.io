Kendall is making the most of an interesting year with COVID-19 putting a halt to most international work and travel commitments.

She found solace in nature earlier this month and posted a few shots from her lakeside vacation.

The reality star had some initial technical difficulties since she wasn't used to the format, but once things got underway the two discussed the perils of voter suppression across the country and the importance of increasing youth voting turnout.

'If you don't like what's happening in America right now, I honestly think this election is your last chance to change it,' Favreau warned.

'Voting won't elect a savior, it won't solve all our problems, but voting will give us a chance to do something about climate change, systemic racism, healthcare, and education. Voting will give us a chance to make sure that our politics isn't as f**ked up as it is right now, and that we're not all at each other's throats like we are right now.'
