It comes after the TV star admitted she 'sobbed every night' when her son Cameron first went to university, as she shared a candid Instagram post earlier this month.

Sharing snaps of her 25-year-old, who she shares with ex-husband John Turnbull, she reflected on when he left home seven years earlier, and the TV presenter said she was 'not good at letting go'.

In her emotional post about Cameron, she wrote: 'This day SEVEN years ago, I dropped you off at Uni. Drove home and mourned for 3 months.

'I sobbed every night': It comes after the TV star admitted she 'sobbed every night' when her son Cameron first went to university, as she shared a candid Instagram post earlier this month 

'Couldn't go in your room. Sobbed every night I laid the table for one less. Felt heartbroken; bereft.

'For all those parents going through the same right now: it does eventually get better. And then they come home penniless, hungover and qualified as plonkers (and in Goldenballs' case, Film Director).

'But the changing shape of the family isn't always an easy transition. 2 out of 4 of mine are gone.'

Struggle: In her emotional post about Cameron, she wrote: 'This day SEVEN years ago, I dropped you off at Uni. Drove home and mourned for 3 months'

She went on: 'Now and my youngest wonders why I cling on to him for dear life when he walks to school every morning, dragging me along the ground, behind him....'

'I'm just not good at letting go of things I thought I owned but are apparently just on loan, 's all (sic).'

Her post comes after she praised her 'brilliant' daughter Martha for passing her GCSEs last month, after the government's U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimated grades following the cancellation of exams amid the pandemic. 

The presenter, who shares the 16-year-old with businessman ex Lance Gerrard-Wright, was every inch the proud mother as she took to Instagram to upload a cheery image of the teen.

Joker: Ulrika added, 'For all those parents going through the same right now: it does eventually get better. And then they come home penniless, hungover and qualified as plonkers'

Honest: Ulrika went on, 'I'm just not good at letting go of things I thought I owned but are apparently just on loan, 's all'

She wrote: 'Martha Moo. So proud of you. (Except when you sleep til 3pm). But: GCSEs. You did it. In a messed up year with so many rites of passage snatched from you by C-19.'

Injecting a hint of her typical humour into the post, the media personality added: 'You have a brilliant mind. And you're stubborn. What else does a girl need?Maybe an alarm clock. 

'Love you, darling girl. (Wishing all parents and students well today. What a palaver....)' (sic).

Yay! The presenter who shares the 16-year-old with businessman ex Lance Gerrard-Wright, was every inch the proud mother as she took to Instagram to congratulate the teen

The results for GCSE students were released at the same time as revised A-level results which showed more than 10 per cent of A-level entries have been upgraded following a U-turn on the way results are awarded, with 38.1 per cent of students gaining an A or A* this year, compared to 27.6 per cent in 2019. 

It was also announced that all A-Level students with the correct grades will get into their first choice of university, and caps on student numbers for medical degrees have been scrapped. 

The surge comes after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson scrapped the controversial algorithm system for both A-levels and GCSEs following a mass outcry from students and parents - and conceded teachers' predicted grades must be used to mark pupils who could not sit their exams because of the pandemic. 

The Swedish TV star also shares children Bo, 19, with hotel manager Marcus Kempen, and Malcolm, 12, with advertising executive Brian Monet.
