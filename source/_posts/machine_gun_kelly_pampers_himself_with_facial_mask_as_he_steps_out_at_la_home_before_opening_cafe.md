Machine Gun Kelly has had a busy weekend, with the release of his fifth studio album and the grand opening of his new cafe in Cleveland.

But the Houston-born actor/musician is finding time to fit in some self-care, as he jets off from one city to the next.

He pampered himself Friday with a facial mask, as he stepped out shirtless at his Los Angeles home, before catching a flight with girlfriend Megan Fox to Cleveland for the opening of 27 Club Coffee.

The 30-year-old showed off his tatted torso in a pair of iridescent basketball shorts with white sneakers and a pearl necklace.

He and Fox, 34, were later spotted heading out to catch their private flight with some friends, following a night of partying to celebrate his new album Tickets to My Downfall.  

Kelly (whose real name is Colson Baker) posted a mirror selfie to Instagram with his girlfriend from the festivities, writing: 'happy boy #TicketsToMyDownfall OUT NOW'

He sported a sleeveless white ensemble, adorned with hand-painted words and designs, as Fox cut a classic look in a black leather jacket.

The lovebirds were spotted scaling the side of the iconic West Hollywood venue The Roxy during their night of decadence. 

The Bird Box actor told Howard Stern earlier this week of their whirlwind romance: 'I didn't know what [love] was until me and her made eye contact. That's when I was like, "Whoa."

'After I made the big chunk of the album, I did fall in love for the first time. That was my first experience with being open to love and stuff like that. I definitely wasn't set up to believe that that's something that could ever exist.' 

He and the Jennifer's Body star were first romantically linked back in May, after working together on their upcoming film Midnight in the Switchgrass.

They began dating after her split from husband-of-10-years Brian Austin Green, 47, with whom she shares sons Noah Shannon, seven, Bodhi Ransom, six, and Journey River, four. 

Fox also starred in the music video for his single Bloody Valentine, which dropped shortly after they were first spotted together in May.

The Transformers star says on the track: 'It was just four months ago that we were right here and I met you. That's not possible. You just got my initials tattooed on you. I just got your nickname tattooed on me.'

She accompanied him to the grand opening of his new establishment 27 Club Coffee, which took place Saturday in Cleveland.

Kelly was met with applause as he cut the ceremonial ribbon in a video posted to Instagram, as he exclaimed: 'Some Cleveland boys opened up a Cleveland shop!'

He captioned the video: 'officially opened our coffee shop today in Cleveland @27clubcoffee EST boys up @andreciscoxx #TicketsToMyDownfall out now'

The Hotel Diablo artist also showed a glimpse of the massive crowd behind him in another video, shouting: 'What's up to the world, from Cleveland, Ohio right now!'

He previously explained to WKYC: 'The 27 Club is a bunch of artists and entertainers, and popular personalities that have died at the age of 27.

'I also want to encourage good highs, like coffee and food and having that kinda bleed through the city instead of some of the other stuff that tends to get out there.'

Kelly also revealed that he's displaying his MTV Video Music Award, which he won last month in the Alternative Video category for Bloody Valentine, at the cafe.

He said on the red carpet: 'I mean, gotta spray paint it pink, and then probably... I want to put it in the coffee shop that we just opened up in Cleveland. 

'I wanna put it there. I want like everyone who comes in to get coffee to acknowledge that one of their own got a moonman.'

The King of Staten Island actor was also accompanied to the opening by daughter Casie, 11, whom he shares with ex Emma Cannon.
