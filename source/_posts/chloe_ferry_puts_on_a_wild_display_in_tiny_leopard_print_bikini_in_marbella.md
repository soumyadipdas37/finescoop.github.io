She's living it up in Marbella, celebrating her 25th birthday with a sun-soaked and booze-filled getaway.

And on Thursday Geordie Shore star Chloe Ferry showed off another risque look as she caught some sun after another night of partying.

The reality star showed off her jaw-dropping figure in a wild animal print bikini for a day by the pool with her MTV co-star Bethan Kershaw.

Chloe highlighted her surgically enhanced curves in her racy choice of swimwear, with the tiny top barely covering her ample assets.

The high-cut bottoms flaunted her tiny waist and long legs, while also showing off her pert derriere with the skimpy thong style.

Chloe added even more glam to her poolside look with a pair of towering heeled sandals in a nude shade.

She kept cool in the Spanish sunshine with statement shades, and tied her long blonde locks into playful pigtails.

Bethan meanwhile was looking equally glam in her racy cut-out black swimsuit and wide-brimmed hat.

The pals kept busy on their phones, no doubt checking back on their antics the night before, which saw them hit the town again. 

'It is my fifth day on the drink, still celebrating my birthday, how do I do it? When are my birthday celebrations going to stop?' Chloe told her Instagram followers the night before.

A raging hangover on Tuesday morning hadn't stopped the party girls going out again, even though Chloe admitted she 'had to get carried home last night because I was too drunk.'

Back in May, Chloe cried 'tears of happiness' as she thanked her followers for their support during her weight loss journey in an emotional Instagram clip. 

Despite her transformation, the beautician recently admitted she still doesn't 'feel great' about her figure.

Chloe said the trolls have got 'inside my head' after being inundated with cruel taunts calling her 'fat and ugly every day'.
