The Bachelor's Bella Varelis is tipped to one of Locky Gilbert's final two contestants. 

But on Monday, the 25-year-old marketing consultant pretty much let slip that she is no longer with the adventure guide, 31. 

Bella described fellow contestant Bec Cvilikas as her 'other half' on the show rather than Locky, hinting that their relationship is over. 

'Bec was my other half!' Did The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (left) just let slip she's not with Locky Gilbert (right)? 

'Bec was my other half. Once we met, it was like, yep, we're going to be friends,' Bella told New Idea.  

While Bella was only talking about her friendship with Bec, the use of the term 'other half' is telling since it is normally reserved for romantic partners. 

Meanwhile, Bec said: 'The second we met, I knew we were going to be friends.' 

Besties! Bella (left) said fellow contestant Bec Cvilikas (right) is her 'other half', which is an interesting choice of words a friend 

Bella and Bec, both 25, remain close off the show and frequently hang out together.

The pair even wore matching outfits and went for a girls' breakfast with model Jordan Simek at White Rabbit in Double Bay on Sunday.   

They are two of just four contestants who remain on The Bachelor along with Irena Srbinovska and Izzy Sharman-Firth.   

All over? Bella and Locky enjoyed many dates together but the 25-year-old marketing consultant is rumoured to come second place on the show

While Bella and Bec are close friends, she has an ongoing feud with Irena, who is tipped to win Locky's final rose over her. 

The women found it increasingly hard to be around each other as their feud escalated and numbers dwindled in the mansion. 

An on-set source previously told Daily Mail Australia that the front-runners were separated by producers into different hotels at the height of the show's drama.
