Film fans have gone wild over a poster for upcoming release Cordelia which shows a woman physically dominating a man in a sexually-charged position.

The image shows Northern Irish actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes pinning co-star Johnny Flynn against the wall from behind while holding his arms down and kissing his neck in a suggestive manner.  

The poster was shared on Twitter by artist Harriet Mould, who noted: 'I legit don't think I've ever seen this pose this way round before.' The post has had 14,000 retweets and received more than 93,000 likes in just 24 hours.

Twitter users were left feeling hot under the collar, with one posting: 'Good Lord. I can't stop staring.'

Another tweeted: 'Now this might be my typa coffee, a movie with a dominant woman and a not-so-dominant man [sic].'

A third added: 'I haven't the slightest clue what it's about but i want premiere tickets.'

However others were left disappointed when they watched the trailer and discovered the UK film is a modern day psychological thriller and not the romp the poster suggests. 

Others noted there seemed to be a 'period movie' feel to the image, although the film is set in present day England.

The film poster left fans feeling hot under the collar and they joked they wanted tickets without needing to see a preview. Dozens have taken to Twitter to share their excitement (pictured) 

One tweeted: 'I straight up thought Cordelia was a period piece about a sexually dominate woman based on its poster, and apparently I wasn't alone. But we're all wrong. It's a modern day horror movie? Huh.'

A second user agreed: 'The poster made me think it was gonna be some Victorian era love story or sumn [sic]. But the teaser looks like that of a modern age horror/thriller movie. I'm confused.' 

Directed by Adrian Shergold, the film stars Antonia Campbell-Hughes as both title character Cordelia and her twin sister Caroline. 

The sisters live in their central London basement flat left to them by their late father.

The trailer reveals Cordelia is a psychological thriller, not the romp suggested by the poster

Cordelia, who has been left traumatised from an event from the past, sees her recovery thrown into turmoil when her sister leaves for a weekend away, according to film site Flickering Myth. 

It is then that Cordelia meets neighbour Frank, played by Flynn, who appeared in Emma and is set to star as David Bowie in biopic Stardust.    

'As their relationship develops, Cordelia becomes convinced she is being stalked. Increasingly anxious and unsure of Frank’s motives, Cordelia begins to unravel,' Flickering Myth continues.

However Frank is also wary of Cordelia. At one point in the trailer, he asks: 'Am I safe with you, Cordelia?'





However others were left disappointed when they watched the trailer and discovered the film is a modern day psychological thriller and not the romp the poster suggests. Others noted there seemed to be a 'period movie' feel to the image, although the film is set today

Cordelia is due to be released in the UK on October 23.
