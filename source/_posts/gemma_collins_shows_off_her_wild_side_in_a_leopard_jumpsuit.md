She recently furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her because she was 'too fat' while working on The Only Way Is Essex.

And Gemma Collins continued to showcase her own clothing range on Thursday, as she wowed in a leopard print jumpsuit in a snap posted to her Instagram page.

Gemma kept her look typically glamorous as she sported a full face of make-up with a dramatic eye look, while wearing her blonde locks in beachy waves.

The former TOWIE star wrote in the caption of the image: 'Night Huns. new lounge wear in @gemc_boutique', as she advertised the new collection.

Gemma recently spoke about how she didn't receive promotional deals with clothing brands while appearing on the ITV reality show.  

Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body. 

'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.

'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand. So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?'  

Earlier this week, Gemma begged fans to listen to Boris Johnson after the Prime Minister's address to the nation on Tuesday night. 

The Diva Forever star took to Instagram on Wednesday to issue an important message to her followers of how they should stick to the tougher restrictions. 

Boris has imposed a set of new restrictions, including a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants, indoor sports subject to the rule of six, and people working from home where possible- all of which could last for six months.

'X LETS DO THIS we could SAVE Christmas and more importantly SAVE LIFES !!! Let's stop moaning !!!! And let’s START DOING #supportborisjohnson #savelifes.'

It comes after the reality star revealed she has developed a bit of a crush on Boris Johnson, following his weight loss. 

Talking to PlayOJO bingo, Gemma said last week: 'It's really encouraging to see Boris taking action to tackle the issue of obesity in our country. 

'Boris has lost some weight himself recently – I saw him on the news the other day with his weight loss and his holiday tan and I thought "Boris looks a bit of a sort". 

'Bless you Boris – losing weight will make anyone feel better.'

The Prime Minister, 56, has lost at least a stone in weight and has enlisted the help of a personal trainer after recovering from coronavirus.
