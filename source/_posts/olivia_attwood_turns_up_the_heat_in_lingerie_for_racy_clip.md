Working it: Olivia Attwood shared a sizzling throwback video to Instagram on Monday, after revealing she's leaving Essex to 'prioritise her life' with fiancé Bradley Dack

The former grid girl highlighted her toned figure in the tiny two-piece, which she teamed with a bedazzled waistbelt to add a hint of glamour to her sexy appearance.

Bombshell Olivia kept accessories to a minimum as she stuck her tongue out and flashed a peace sign at the camera. 

A half up half down hairstyle framed her face perfectly, which was also enhanced with a full face of dewy foundation, false lashes and nude lipgloss. 

The TV star captioned the clip: 'Pressure makes the diamond. Lost files from when we played dress up @makeupbymikey x @hairtohelp / set @victoriassecret.' (sic)

Days earlier, Olivia shocked her TOWIE castmates by finally making the decision to leave Essex and focus on life with her footballer fiancé Bradley, 26.

During the show,  the blonde beauty explained how she was feeling conflicted about spending so much time away from her beau and being with the girls in the English county. 

Revealing her decision at the end of the show, Olivia said: 'I've got everything I've ever wanted waiting in Manchester, a whole life I'm missing out on.

'These last few weeks saying I feel conflicted and feel I've come to realisation I need to be up there a bit more permanently. It's the right thing to do, it's just sad isn't it.

'The last year has been amazing, so many highs and some of the best times of life. Some people are going to miss me, and some not so much. 

'But I know who I am and I've got pals for life. So girls, there's no time like the present. I'm gonna leave now before any more drama starts.'
