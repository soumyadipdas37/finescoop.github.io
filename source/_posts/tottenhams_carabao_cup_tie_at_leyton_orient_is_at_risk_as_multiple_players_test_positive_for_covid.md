Tottenham's Carabao Cup clash with Leyton Orient could be in doubt after the League Two club announced that a number of first team players have tested positive for coronavirus. 

Orient have said in an official statement that they have informed the EFL and Tottenham and will make an announcement on the status of Tuesday's game shortly.

'We have also informed Mansfield Town, Plymouth Argyle and Oldham Athletic, our three most recent opponents, prior to the public release of this information,' the statement continued.

Leyton Orient have announced that a host of first team players have tested positive for covid

5.1 A Club which is unable to fulfil its obligation to complete a Competition match in Round One to (and including) Round Four due to either:

5.1.1 that Club’s Player(s) having returned a positive CAT result and self-isolating in accordance with the action plan set out in the Return to Play/Return to Training Protocols resulting in the Club not having a sufficient number of Players to fulfil the fixture; or

5.1.2 any requirements or directions of the UK Government and/or by any public authority,

shall forfeit the fixture, pay the opposing Club’s expenses in accordance with Rule 5.8 and the opposing team shall receive a bye into the next round of the Competition.

The League Two club have also closed down their training ground and stadium, putting them both into lockdown just 24 hours before the cup tie.  

'Leyton Orient’s priority is the health and well-being of its players and staff. Those who have tested positive will now strictly follow government self-isolation guidelines. 

EFL rules state that a club which is unable to fulfil its obligation to play due to positive covid tests may have to forfeit the fixture, pay the opposing club's expenses, who will receive a bye to the next round.

The breaking news comes after Tottenham announced that they would auction their signed match shirts from the game.

Proceeds from the auction were to go to the JE3 Foundation, set up in memory of former Orient manager Justin Edinburgh, who died of a heart attack last year.
