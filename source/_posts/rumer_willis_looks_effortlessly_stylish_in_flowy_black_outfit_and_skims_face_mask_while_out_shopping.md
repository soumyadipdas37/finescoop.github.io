She recently was spotted getting cozy with Armie Hammer. 

But Rumer Willis went solo on Tuesday as she enjoyed shopping in Los Angeles' Brentwood neighborhood. 

The 32-year-old actress looked casual and chic in a black outfit that she teamed with a beige face mask from Kim Kardashian's SKIMS line.

She wore a deep cut black tee that exposed much of her chest. 

For a casual look, Rumer teamed it with black joggers in a linen style and white slip on Vans sneakers. 

Most of her face was covered in the beige face mask and dark black shades. 

Leaving her black hair down in a curly style, she carried a large white shopping bag as she hit more stores.

Rumer has been the subject of romance rumors in recent days, after she was spotted dining out with Armie Hammer in Los Angeles last week. 

The Call Me By Your Name star had his arm wrapped around her as they left a cafe, while she inserted a hand under his thick sweater.

The two have kept any possible relationship quiet, though they follow each other on Instagram, and she reacted to an Instagram video of him running down a tarmac with the praise hands emoji.

The public outing came just weeks after Armie and his ex Elizabeth announced they were separating after 10 years of marriage and having two children together, Harper, five, and Ford, three.

For his birthday last month, the newly-minted 34-year-old shared that for the last two months he has been living with a friend and working construction since splitting from his wife. 

Rumer has previously been linked to British actor Ricky Whittle, and American actors Jayson Blair and Micah Alberti.
