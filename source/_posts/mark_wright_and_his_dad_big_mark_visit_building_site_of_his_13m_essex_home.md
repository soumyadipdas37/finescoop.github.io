Work is officially underway on Mark Wright and Michelle Keegan's dream home. 

On Wednesday, the former TOWIE star sported high-vis as he was spotted on the building site of his new house alongside his dad 'Big Mark', who works in construction, as they overlooked the developments of the swanky home. 

Mark and Michelle, both aged 33, bought the home for £1.3million in October and it was revealed in January that they would demolish the four bedroom Essex farmhouse to create the sensationally lavish new house with 'classical design'. 

Hard at work! Work is officially underway on Mark Wright and Michelle Keegan's dream home and on Wednesday, the former TOWIE star sported high-vis as he was spotted on the building site of his new house

Mark looked engrossed in his work as he chatted to his dad and a fellow construction expert who they warmly greeted on site. 

Back in June it was revealed that the sprawling new home will feature a huge swimming pool, bar and make-up room, floor plans have revealed. 

Posted on Epping Council website and being designed by Essex-based company MP Architects, the stunning plans show the couple's incredible vision, which also features a playroom for any future kids. 

Earlier this year, they submitted plans to knock down their home and replace with a sprawling Georgian-style mansion - details of which can be seen online.

Wow! The new home will feature a huge swimming pool, bar and make-up room, floor plans revealed

Happy days: The couple have been married for five years (pictured in March last year)

Big ideas: Their planning agent previously said: 'This new house has been carefully designed so that it is similar in area and volume to what is currently on the site

While the couple had no objections from neighbours, they withdrew requests for 'demolition of an existing stable building' to build a 'one-bedroom annexe'.

Images of the ground floor show the home is set to give a nod to both their love of work and play, with a gym and bar placed either side of the huge kitchen.

The hub of the home is certainly the kitchen, which runs the entire length of the back of the house and includes a living area and island.

Every bedroom features an en suite while cupboards are littered through the floor. The first floor features three bedrooms.

Second floor plans show two more bedrooms and further en suites.

Set on sprawling grounds, the rear of the house boasts a swimming pool plan while the vast drive is set to accommodate a plethora of cars.

Their planning agent previously said: 'This new house has been carefully designed so that it is similar in area and volume to what is currently on the site.

'The new house will sit further back on the site and will create a much more functional family dwelling for our clients.

'The existing house has been extended several times and is not functional, therefore a new house would be a better use of the site.'

That was then: On starting a family after moving into their dream home, Mark previously said: 'We say we're going to try [for a baby] every year but something comes up with work'

On starting a family after moving into their dream home, Mark previously said: 'We say we're going to try [for a baby] every year but something comes up with work...

'So it'll be Michelle filming in South Africa and then I got the job in Los Angeles – so we think, right, we'll try next year. It'll be around December or January, we'll talk about it and we'll go from there.

'With kids, I used to want three or four. But now, I'm 31, we're not having kids any time before 32. I think we could have two or three. Twins would be great because you're getting two out of the way at once!
