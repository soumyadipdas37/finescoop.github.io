The outing comes as Rachel revealed her hopes for baby daughter Maven, nine months, to be bilingual as husband Pasha Kovalev only talks to her 'solely in Russian'.

The Countdown star appeared Good Morning Britain recently where she sweetly spoke about her family.

Discussing baby daughter Maven, she said: 'She's got teeth, she's biting us, she's all about chat chat chat!  

'Pasha is speaking to her solely in Russian and I'm speaking to her in English so we're hoping she'll be bilingual.'

She said: 'We were quite lucky, but we lost our audience which is a shame as they come time and time again, we're like a little family.

'The person who comes and takes the letters from me is in full hazmat gear and has a spatula!' 

Rachel, Pasha and Maven have spent lockdown with her Russian mother-in-law Galina, whose month-long visit to the UK was extended amid the pandemic.   

The couple, who became first-time parents to Maven in December and met on Strictly Come Dancing, have enjoyed extended time off at home amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.
