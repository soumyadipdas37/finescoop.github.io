Gabby Douglas took to Instagram on Thursday to speak candidly about her emotional hair journey and how she, eventually, overcame the 'challenge.'

'From a very young age i always had to put my hair in a tight ponytail to do gymnastics and due to that my hair became completely damaged,' began the 24-year-old Olympian in her post's lengthy caption.

Along with her retrospective text, Douglas proudly showed off a current photo of her long, healthy hair.

Gabby added that the damage from the recurring 'tight ponytails' got so bad that it led to her having 'bald spots on the back of [her] head.'

'I was so embarrassed and self-conscious that i put a bunch of clips over the spots to try and cover them up, but it was still noticeable,' she explained.  

'My hair grew a little, but shortly after, i had to cut all of my hair off because it was so damaged. i cried and cried and cried.'

Gabby admitted that 'most days [she] didn’t even want to go to the gym because [she] felt so embarrassed that all [her] hair was gone.'

'I used to think: why can’t i have healthy hair? despite yet another challenge, i kept going. fast forward to the both olympics and my hair was the topic of conversation.'

Gabby was referencing to her legendary participation in the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, where she was met with an influx of criticism over her hair online.

'now here i am today - no extensions - no clip-ins - no wigs - no chemicals - all me,' the gymnast concluded.

Gabby became a household name in 2012 when she became the 'all around champion' in gymnastics at the Olympic Games in London, England.

She was also part of the gold-winning American gymnastics teams in 2012 Olympics and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

Douglas announced earlier this week that she will be ambassador for the highly anticipated 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

'diversity is strength and there’s no stopping us when we come together. pumped to join the @LA28Games as an #LA28Creator. #LA28.' she wrote.

Gabby also included a short promo for the impending Olympic Games, which majorly excited her 1.5million Instagram followers.

She also used her platform to honor the life of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, who passed away last Friday after a four-year battle with colon cancer.

The actor, who was 43 at the time of his death, never spoke publicly about his diagnosis.

Gabby shared a fan art image of Boseman and penned a touching caption.

'although i’ve never had the pleasure of meeting you ( i really hoped that i would one day) i heard that your heart and personality was a rare one. 

'a gentle soul, a gentleman, a loving human being. a joy to be around. and as i write this with tears i’m sending your family and your loved ones all my prayer and love. you will truly be missed,' she concluded.
