BBC bosses are under pressure to reveal if they turned down Channel 5 hit All Creatures Great And Small because the series is 'too white'.

The Yorkshire-based story of beloved veterinary surgeon James Herriot story has drawn in three million viewers and is the broadcaster's best-rated original commission ever.

But the show's producer has revealed that the Corporation was given first refusal but passed on the series, fearing that it would not appeal to 16 to 34-year-old viewers.

The BBC, home to the original adaptation which aired in the 1970s and 1980s, reportedly said it would only make a pilot episode.

Sir Colin Callender of Playground, the production company behind the remake, said the BBC 'had concerns about whether it would speak to a younger audience and, I think, whether or not the show could emerge from the shadow of the first series'.

Now the troubled Corporation, which is undergoing an overdue overhaul as questions of its alleged bias persist, is under pressure to admit if it rejected All Creatures because the Yorkshire-based series is 'too white'.

Now the BBC, which passed on All Creatures amid fears it would not appeal to 16 to 34-year-olds, is under pressure to admit if it rejected All Creatures because the series is 'too white'. It follows claims made about Channel 5's programming by boss Ben Frow (pictured)

Addressing claims that his programming is 'white', Channel 5 boss Ben Frow told the virtual Edinburgh TV Festival last month that the need for inclusivity is 'something that is always in the back of our minds'.

He added: 'Sometimes when I'm talking to producers, they say that (Yorkshire) is very white. I say you've got to make the extra effort.'

A later episode of the current All Creatures series will feature a new storyline centring on the experience of a black character, and Callender says that series two will feature more of the same.

MailOnline has approached the BBC for comment.

It comes amid reports that Lord Moore, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph and  vehement critic of the Corporation's 'Left-wing woke values', is Boris Johnson's preferred candidate for Chairman. 

Sir Colin Callender of Playground, the production company behind the remake, said the BBC 'had concerns about whether it would speak to a younger audience and, I think, whether or not the show could emerge from the shadow of the first series'

The 63-year-old has since accepted an approach to replace Sir David Clementi when he steps down in February and has discussed contractual terms.

However, civil servants at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have complained to No 10 that the position has to be formally advertised in order to follow 'due process'. 

Lord Moore objects to its guaranteed £4billion-a-year income from the licence fee. In 2010, he was fined £262 for not possessing a licence, having donated the equivalent sum to charity in protest at the BBC's refusal to sack Jonathan Ross for making prank calls with comedian Russell Brand to the actor Andrew Sachs.

Allies of Mr Johnson complain that Civil Service selection protocols introduced by Jeremy Heywood when he was Cabinet Secretary forced candidates to jump through 'hoops' designed to ensure the selection of 'members of the same Left-wing cabal'.
