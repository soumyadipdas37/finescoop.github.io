Larsa had a rumoured fall out with the Kardashian family earlier this year as Kourtney and Khloe unfollowed her on Instagram amid Kanye West's Twitter meltdown.

The dramatic unfollowing was seemingly prompted after the rapper, 43, cryptically Tweeted: 'Larsa,' along with a thinking face emoji, followed by the question: 'Should I name more?' 

Larsa appeared to respond by unfollowing the famous sisters, including her BFF Kim. 

The following morning she appeared to address the rumours as she shared a post in which she revealed she was: 'praying that everybody finds peace'.

Kim recently announced the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, in which Larsa was a show regular.  

The reality TV series has followed the lives of the family – including sisters Kourtney, 41, Kim, 39, and Khloe, 36, half sisters Kendall, 24, and Kylie Jenner, 23, brother Rob, 33, and mother Kris Jenner, 64 – for 20 seasons aired over the past 14 years.

However, it has now been confirmed the show will be coming to an end with the 21st season in early 2021.
