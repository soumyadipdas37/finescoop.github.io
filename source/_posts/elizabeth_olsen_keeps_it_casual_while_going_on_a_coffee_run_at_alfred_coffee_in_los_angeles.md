Olsen made headlines last week when she deactivated her Instagram account, after trolls started bashing her for not saying anything publicly about the death of Chadwick Boseman.

Olsen and Boseman both shared the screen in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Fans also bashed Boseman's Black Panther co-star Lupita Nyong'o for not saying anything about Boseman's death on social media, though she did release a poignant statement on Tuesday.
