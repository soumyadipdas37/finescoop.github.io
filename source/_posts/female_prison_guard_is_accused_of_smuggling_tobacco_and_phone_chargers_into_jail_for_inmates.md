A NSW prison guard is accused of smuggling tobacco and two mobile phone chargers into a jail on the state's mid north coast.

Last month, detectives from the Corrective Services Investigation Unit established Strike Force Acres to investigate the introduction of contraband by the female officer.

Detectives arrested a 49-year-old woman at a Port Macquarie home on Tuesday.

She was taken to Port Macquarie Police Station and charged with unlawfully secreting a thing for an inmate to receive.

Police will allege in court that the woman, who is a Corrective Services NSW officer, trafficked tobacco and two mobile phone chargers into a correctional facility in July this year.

The woman was granted strict conditional bail to appear at Port Macquarie Local Court on October 14.

The woman has been suspended by Corrective Services NSW.
