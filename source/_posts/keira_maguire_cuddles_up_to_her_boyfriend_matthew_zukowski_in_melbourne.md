Keira Maguire confirmed her romance with Love Island's Matthew Zukowski in July, and it appears they are still going strong. 

On Tuesday, the couple cuddled up on a romantic picnic together at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne. 

Posting photos of their outing to Instagram, the reality stars appeared more in love than ever as Matthew planted a kiss on Keira's cheek.

'Went on a cute little picnic in the botanical gardens,' Keira, 34, captioned the snaps. 

The Bachelor in Paradise star cut a casual figure in an all-black ensemble comprising a Nike jumper and socks, which she paired with sneakers and a cap. 

The bombshell styled her blonde hair loosely and opted for a simple makeup look consisting of foundation and eyeliner.

Love Island star Matthew, 25, opted for black pants and a blue tie-dye jumper, which he paired with a backwards-facing cap. 

Last month, Keira admitted she was 'loving isolation' in Melbourne as she shared a clip to Instagram during a night in with Matthew. 

She couldn't resist heaping praise on her beau as he walked by in the background, telling her followers: 'I've got this one, and he's just made me tea. How cute!'

She also revealed the pair were watching the 2013 horror movie Carrie, starring Chloë Grace Moretz. 

'Literally, how many horror movies have we watched,' she could be heard saying.

The couple had been forced to keep a low profile for months while Keira was on Bachelor in Paradise, but paparazzi photos published on July 7 exposed their romance.
