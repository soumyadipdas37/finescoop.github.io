Today show host Karl Stefanovic failed to keep the law and odour on Thursday's episode as he savagely accused Allison Langdon of smelling like garlic.

The pair were speaking to Dr Penny Adams about the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting sleep patterns when Karl noted that many people were trying herbal medicines to switch off at night - including his co-host.

'Ally has got a liking for garlic which is unfortunate for the entire crew here at Channel Nine,' the 46-year-old hilariously noted while fellow journalist Alex Cullen jokingly pretended there was a lingering stench in the air.

'It's a bit woofy this morning!' Karl quipped, before re-iterating: 'It's so woofy, it's not funny!'

Pretending that Allison's hygiene levels were so inadequate that they could no longer handle it, Karl and Alex put on clear face shields to protect themselves.

Luckily, Allison proved to be a good sport, as she said: 'Look, I owned it as soon as I walked in this morning!

'I also agree that it's not a pleasant experience for you guys this morning.'

Allison has been a firm fixture in Australia's broadcasting industry for nearly two decades.

And the TV personality has hardly aged a day since beginning her career for Channel Nine in 2001 as a junior researcher and producer.

While the presenter has swapped out her shorter darker blonde tresses with lusciously lighter locks, she has always sported a youthful glow.

Allison has worked her way up in the Channel Nine newsroom before hitting the big time as a reporter for 60 Minutes.

The TV star went on to replace Deborah Knight as co-host of Weekend Today in December 2017, and she also became a fill-in presenter on Nine News Sydney and the Today show during the same time.

From January this year, Langdon began presenting the Today show with co-host Karl Stefanovic.

Despite her hectic schedule, Allison has also looked sensational for the cameras.

She has kept regularly coy about her beauty and fitness secrets over the years.

However, she has been regularly spotted enjoying the Bronte to Bondi coastal walk to stay in shape.

No doubt, her children, son Mack, 3, and two-year-old daughter Scout - who she shares with television executive husband Michael Willesee Jr. - keep her on her feet.

Speaking to 9Honey last year, Allison admitted that her approach to motherhood was very different the second time around.

'I'm such a different parent this time, I'm so much more relaxed – I think I've got it this time,' she said.

She admitted that when she fell pregnant for the first time, she wasn't 'naturally maternal'.

'Because it didn't come to me naturally I thought, "That's okay, like everything else I can just learn it. If I read enough books, I'd be awesome at it,"' she explained.
