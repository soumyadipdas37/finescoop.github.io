Kmart Australia has released a range of dolls with disabilities, including ones that are blind, deaf, on crutches, in a wheelchair or have a bionic leg.

The move has been celebrated by customers of the discount retailer, particularly those with disabilities themselves, as a 'refreshing' form of representation.

A mother from Sydney posted a photo of the dolls in a Facebook group, saying she thought they were so 'neat' she had to share.

'This is very cool and about time. I've seen that Barbie are doing this as well,' said one commenter.

'Nice to see a little diversity but I would love to see dolls that are African, Asian ect. There no diversity in race,' said another.

A third added: 'Absolutely LOVE this! My mum was blind and I still have some of her mobility aids, I actually want the doll to go with it on the display now'.

Each doll is $6 each and comes in its own outfit, which can be mixed and matched between them

Another said: 'As someone who uses a wheelchair, I think this is fantastic!'

Some people joked that the male doll wearing hearing aids was just a 'regular man' who has 'selective hearing' when it comes to listening to his wife or girlfriend.

But the doll does have a tiny electronic device attached to his ear to resemble an aid

'Breaking the stereotypes... beauty is always associated with physical appearance so hats off to the designer of these dolls,' one woman said. 

The Our Generation dolls at Target offer a similar range of inclusive characters and accessories, but these toys start from $32.
