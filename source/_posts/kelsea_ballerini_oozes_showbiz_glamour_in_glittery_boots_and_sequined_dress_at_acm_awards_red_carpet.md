Kelsea Ballerini oozed showbiz glamour as she hit the ACM Awards red carpet in Nashville this Wednesday.

The 27-year-old country blonde showed off her knockout legs at the socially distant event in an elaborate sequined dress.

She unleashed her animal instinct with a bit of black leopard print over a deep purple and rust-colored background.

Sizzling sensation: Kelsea Ballerini oozed showbiz glamour as she hit the ACM Awards red carpet in Nashville this Wednesday

Her ensemble featured raised shoulders reminiscent of the 1980s as well as a Grecian chic sash draped across the front.

The sash was buckled to her waistline at the middle and then dangled down past the hemline of her shimmering skirt.

Sweeping her blonde hair into a fashionable updo she rounded off the look with a pair of leopard print cowgirl boots.

The awards show extravaganza will blend live and pre-taped segments and be held across three Nashville landmarks, facilitating social distancing.

One site is the Ryman Auditorium which is where Kelsea was pictured, and the others were the Grand Ole Opry and Bluebird Cafe.

Earlier this week Kelsea was corporate chic in a pinstripe getup as she gave a virtual radio interview in Nashville and dished about her upcoming red carpet look.

'What's so funny about this is, this outfit is something that I was gonna wear on a carpet before the world shut down,' she spilled to Radio.com.

'And I told my stylist, I was like: "Hold this outfit, 'cause it's too good and I don't - don't send it back, like, just wait," and it was perfect for this,' said Kelsea.

'But it's like this dress and these matching sequin boots. They're like red sequin cowgirl boots. They're bad-A,' she gushed.

Kelsea, who won the Gene Weed Milestone award at the ACM Awards three years ago, is up for the best female vocalist gong this year.

She is competing in a formidable category for the prize, facing off against Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood, Kacey Musgraves and Maren Morris.

Kelsea released her new album ballerini last Friday and performed onstage at the Ryman Auditorium during the awards show - however her song of choice was this May's single Hope In A Bottle from her album Kelsea which she dropped in March.

Finding a way: 'What's so funny about this is, this outfit is something that I was gonna wear on a carpet before the world shut down,' she spilled to Radio.com
