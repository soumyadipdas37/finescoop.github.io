She recently announced her shock split from boyfriend Tom Brazier.

But Laura Anderson showed she could more than hold her own going solo, as she stepped out for dinner at popular celebrity eatery The Ivy in London's Covent Garden on Saturday. 

Having travelled back down from Scotland for the night, the 2018 Love Island star, 31, looked effortlessly chic in a pale violet trench coat.

Always one with an eye for an ensemble, Laura matched her coat with an oversized cream cricket jumper with an orange and burgundy trim. 

She marched along the pavement in heeled cream boots, while her loose caramel tresses flowed along in the breeze.  

The reality star accessorised with an elegant gold chain, while she kept her makeup to a minimum with just a slick of gloss and a dash of bronzer to highlight her summer glow.   

Laura's latest elegant appearance comes just a couple of weeks after her split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom, which happened soon after she moved back to Scotland.

The split appears to have been sudden, as Laura last posted a picture with the trainer just days before she announced they had separated.

Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story: ''Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.'

Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.

The two even went on holiday to Dubai together and hit the headlines when they were mugged in Barcelona, before Laura also introduced Tom to her family in Scotland. 

Back in April, Laura revealed she would be moving back to Scotland permanently after lockdown is over, due to feeling lonely in the English capital. 

Speaking to Vas J Morgan for his I AM ENOUGH podcast in August, Laura said she had made some big decisions during the lockdown period and told the former TOWIE star said: 'I have decided to move to Scotland because I want to buy a flat.

'I just moved here after Love Island and obviously it's been almost two years now.

'I have been renting my whole life, wasting all my money and I just think it is so expensive in London and I'm quite lonely here, I don't know that many people.

'I've always wanted to wait to meet a guy and buy a house and I think 'no I want to buy a flat myself'.
