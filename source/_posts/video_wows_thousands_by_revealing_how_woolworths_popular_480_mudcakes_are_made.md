Since publishing the video on September 14, it has been viewed more than 613,000 times and 'liked' by 90,000 people.

The Woolworths mudcakes are a customer favourite across Australia, and now a TikTok video has gone viral after revealing how the popular cakes are made

The factory machines demonstrate one of the final steps involved in making the mudcakes.

After the glaze is added, the cakes are slid onto a conveyor belt before being moved to another section of the factory.

Many Australians online recognised the cakes instantly as the budget supermarket product is frequently bought for birthdays.

While many were impressed with the video, some were shocked after they realised the tasty desserts aren't handmade. 

A Woolworths spokesman told Daily Mail Australia: 'We know that many of our customers really love our chocolate mud cakes which are in high demand throughout the year.

'The majority of our Woolworths chocolate mud cake bases are created off-site by a leading Australian bakery supplier and then delivered to our store for our teams to complete the final touches.'

'Australians around the nation have truly been blessed with this video,' one person said.

'An Australian classic,' another said.

A third added: 'All those years of birthdays and here is where all the joy comes from.'

'So you're telling me they're not made by the by the bakers at the bakery section at the shops?' another wrote. 

The cakes can be purchased at Woolworths supermarkets across Australia.
