The fear for many is that the galaxy of global superstars being hoovered up by the so-called elite of the British women's game will make this a season of walkovers.

There was a joke doing the rounds at Arsenal this weekend about who would draw lots for next week's hat-trick.

During an opening half-hour of football in which Everton manager Willie Kirk judged his side in retrospect to have been 's***' and 'shocking', Chelsea looked certain to improve on the nine goals they drove past Bristol City two weeks ago.

Everton celebrate following their brilliant victory over the Women's Super League champions 

They are a relentless side, looking to prise the ball through narrow channels and behind the defence, doing so with a precision which can be overwhelming. It's hard to find a foothold and draw breath against this technical excellence.

When the WSL champions led inside four minutes — world record signing Pernille Harder cutting back for Erin Cuthbert to drive into the bottom corner — you feared for Everton. Harder, Fran Kirby and Sam Kerr all came close, seizing on the ball being processed around Goodison's acres by Ji So-yun, the supreme technician of the first half.

Everton (4-1-4-1): MacIver 7; Moe Wold 6.5, Finnigan 6.5, Sevecke 7.5, Turner 7; Graham 6.5; Sorensen 6.5 (Boye-Hlorkah 80min), Stringer 6 (Egurrola 46, 6), Christiansen 6, Raso 8; Magill 5.5 (Gauvin 46, 6.5). 

Subs not used: Pike, Clemaron, Torpela, Pattinson. 

Manager: Willie Kirk 8.

Chelsea (4-1-4-1): Katrin-Berger 6; Mjelde 5.5, Bright 6.5, Carter 6.5 (Charles 83), Andersson 6; Ingle 6 (Reiten 74); Kirby 7, Ji 6.5 (Leupolz 64, 6), Cuthbert 6, Harder 6; Kerr 5.5 (England 74, 6). 

Subs not used: Thorisdottir, Blundell, Fleming, Spence, Telford. 

Manager: Emma Hayes 6.5.

Referee: Ben Wyatt 6.

But there's a reason why Kirk, the former chartered accountant who inherited a languishing Everton side two years ago, believes they can threaten the success enjoyed by Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal.

The Scot has imbued them with a belief and levels of fitness which saw them withstand Chelsea's early battery, with three strong saves from Sandy MacIver also helping substantially. Kirk's squad have benefited from strong investment, too, but he has bought well and known who to stick with. Denmark defender Rikke Sevecke and Danielle Turner, a 29-year-old who was once in Everton's youth set-up, provided the pick of some stellar defensive performances.

And then there was Hayley Raso, an Australian all but forgotten because injury had meant a seven-month wait for her debut. She covered more ground than anyone, running on to long balls and retreating to defend. Mirror image goals of merit — a cross from Taylor Hinds converted by a Lucy Graham diving header just before the break and Valerie Gauvin's header from a Raso cross after the hour mark — turned the game Everton's way.

Both goals came from Raso's left flank where Kirk had felt Maren Mjelde would be a chink in Chelsea's armoury. 'You can expose her at full back,' he said. Two half-time subs also helped the side retain the ball better. 

Harder did not make a huge impression on her first start for Chelsea and Kerr faded. Kirby, operating in pockets behind the front line, was a greater threat, though frustration built.

The denial of a penalty for what looked like an Ingrid Moe Wold handball from a Kerr cross just before half-time didn't help. And Kirby tripped over the referee when launching one second-half counter attack.

It is a measure of Kirk's ambition that he was still dwelling on the slow start at the end of it all. 'We told them at half-time they were tired because Chelsea had tired them out,' he said. 'Not because of anything they had done. Chelsea can run you ragged if you let them. We had to get the ball in higher positions. Huge credit that they got back into the game.'

Fitting in the closing stages of last season's FA Cup into the new campaign means that Everton will play away to the winners of Birmingham and Brighton in a semi-final on Thursday. A route to Wembley is opening up. 'We won't be out celebrating till we've won something,' Kirk said.

1. Alex Morgan thought she'd had the last laugh with her cup of tea celebration when she scored against England in the World Cup last summer. She looked in dire need of that hot drink when wrapped up in the bitterly cold Borehamwood stands as her new side Tottenham lost 4-0 to Arsenal in the FA Cup. 

'You've got to take these sorts of conditions when you come to England,' said Spurs co-manager Karen Hills. A low-key start maybe — Morgan was an unused sub — but the commercial value of her arrival has been immediate.

Images of her in Spurs gear on day one of training have been retweeted 2,300 times and liked 36,000 times, to the delight of kit sponsor AIA. Morgan's tweets promoting two of her corporate sponsors, Hublot and VW, pale by comparison. 

Morgan told Jose Mourinho 'I think I'm ready' when the cameras captured their first conversation. Even for Morgan, Sunday's visit to Manchester City would be a baptism of fire.

2.  For Manchester United, a new incentive to follow in the footsteps of Everton, Brighton and Chelsea by staging women's games at their stadiums. 

Their new American signing Tobin Heath recalled last week playing for the USA against Canada in an 'epic' 2012 Olympics game there which saw her side trail three times and still win. 

'It's just such an iconic venue for any footballer,' she said. United have no plans for a WSL game at Old Trafford, but the value to the club's brand of doing so would be monumental.

3. Everton managers yearning to play Liverpool have been thin on the ground in recent years, but Willie Kirk misses the rivalry now the Reds are in the second tier. 

'Maybe it's because I've got quite a decent record in the derbies. It's the first fixture you look for,' he says. 

The two are in the same Continental League Cup group and meet on November 18.

 4. The influx of players has made for so many one-sided scorelines that Arsenal players are taking it in turns to score hat-tricks. 

Jill Roord has two already and it was Lisa Evans on Saturday.'

Yeah, we draw straws in the changing room and pick a player (who gets to score the hat-trick),' joked Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro, whose side have scored 19 goals in three games.

5. Early signs suggest the second tier Women's Championship will be a fight for supremacy between Liverpool, desperate for immediate promotion back to the WSL, and Sheffield United, who have invested by hiring Neil Redfearn, who briefly managed the Liverpool side. 

Both won 4-0 on Sunday at home to Charlton and London Bees respectively. They clash at Tranmere on November 8.
