Google searches for 'move to Canada' spiked after the first presidential debate on Tuesday.

The search engine saw queries for moving from the US to the neighboring country spike following the chaotic debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden where they repeatedly interrupted each other and dropped snide comments.  

'How to apply for Canadian citizenship' soared an hour into the debate and peaked around 10.30pm, according to a Google Trends.

It spiked again at 3.44am Wednesday and again around 7.30am.

Google Trends shows that the first spike in searches related to moving to Canada took place around 10.30pm Tuesday evening, about an hour and a half into the debate. It was followed by surges on Wednesday morning around 4am and 7.30am

The most searches came from Massachusetts followed by Michigan, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania

Google searches for 'how to move to Canada' and 'move to Canada' also surged during the contentious debate.

The search for 'how to move to Canada' was most popular in Wyoming, Oregon, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Washington state.

The searches are an echo to the 2016 election when many Americans threatened to flee north if Trump won the presidency. 

Twitter users also shared memes and jokes sarcastically saying they'd pack their bags and move up north, but the border has been closed since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

The raging debate saw Trump bulldoze his opponent and moderator journalist Chris Wallace with interruptions and Biden slam the president a 'clown', 'the worst president America has ever had', and snap 'Will you shut up, man.'

In one stunning moment Wallace asked Trump to condemn white supremacists and militias.

'Proud boys - stand back and stand by! But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left,' Trump said, refusing to outright denounce them.

When Biden brought up his late son Beau and his decorated service in Iraq, Trump quipped back, 'I didn’t know Beau. I know Hunter. He was thrown out, dishonourably discharged for cocaine use.'

CNN host Dana Bash blased the tumultuous debate as 'a s**tshow'.

'That was a s**t show,' the veteran host exclaimed, 'and, you know, we're on cable. We can say that. Apologies for being, maybe a little bit crude, but that is really the phrase I'm getting from people on both sides of the aisle on text and it's the only phrase I can think of to really describe it.'

Her co-hosts Jake Tapper and Abby Phillip shared the same sentiments, describing the event as a 'hot mess inside a dumpster fire, inside a train wreck' and as a 'complete disaster', respectively.

NBC's Chuck Todd described the debate as a 'train wreck', blaming Trump rather than Biden for the chaos.

'We know who did it. President Trump did this,' said Todd.

MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said that 'this sort of debate shouldn't happen in a democracy'.

'What happened on that debate stage was unlike anything that has happened on a presidential debate stage ever before,' she said, calling Trump's performance a 'monstrous cavalcade of increasingly wild and obscene lies'. 

Amid the admonishment, an instant poll conducted by CBS found that a majority of 48 percent of viewers thought that Joe Biden won the opening debate, to just 41 percent who believe Trump did. Another 10 percent of the viewership believed the event ended in a tie.

The vast majority of viewers - 83 percent - said the tone of the debate was negative, and the most common reaction to the proceedings was annoyance, the poll found.

A similar CNN audience poll yielded even less favourable results for Trump. A landslide 60 percent of pollsters ruled a Biden victory, with only 28 percent backing the incumbent.
