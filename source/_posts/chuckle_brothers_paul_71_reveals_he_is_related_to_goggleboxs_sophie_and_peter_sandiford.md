Paul said: '[I miss him] A lot, he'd been with me for 70 years, we worked together as partners for 55 years. I still miss him today. 

'The physical pain you get when somebody dies, it is a physical thing, not just a pain.  

'Every time when I work I always feel that he is there with me and it is a nice feeling. It is a nice feeling that he is there helping me all the way along.

'We were always together, always working together, he was never in my dreams. As soon as he's died he's always been in my dreams with me as well which think of as him being in an afterlife.'
