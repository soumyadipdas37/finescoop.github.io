Jesse Tyler Ferguson and married couple Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively expressed interest in starring in a movie based on Taylor Swift's new track The Last Great American Dynasty.

Then the LA-born 33-year-old referenced the song lyrics by joking that she painted the Canadian 43-year-old 'key lime green' while he mentioned the heart attack his potential character Bill would suffer.

Swift and Aaron Dessner co-wrote The Last Great American Dynasty based on the eccentric life of socialite Rebekah Harkness, who was known to clean her pool out with Dom Pérignon and once dyed a neighbor's cat green.

The 10-time Grammy winner originally learned about Rebekah - who died, age 67, from cancer in 1982 - after buying her 'Holiday House' mansion in Watch Hill, RI for $17M in 2013.
