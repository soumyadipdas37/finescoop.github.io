She's been spotted spending time with her boyfriend in Los Angeles in recent days.

But Chantel Jeffries and Andrew Taggart took their romance south of the border on Tuesday, seen soaking up the sun while vacationing in Mexico's Cabo San Lucas.

The 27-year-old DJ and model put on a red-hot display while going for a dip in the ocean with her 31-year-old boyfriend Drew, who's one-half of The Chainsmokers.

Chantel flaunted her rock-hard abs in her string bikini, which had triangular cups, while long strings dangled down her thighs from her high-cut bottoms.

The white two-piece suit was decorated with an intriguing African nature scene featuring an elephant, a giraffe and plenty of flora. 

The musician stayed off the hot sand with a pair of fluffy white and orange sandals, and she ran her fingers through her raven locks as she headed toward the water.

Drew opted for more reserved beach attire with a set of red swim trunks, and he sported a close-cropped beard.

On Monday, Chantel showed off another seaside bikini look while vacation in Mexico.

She posted a selfie showcasing her clear skin and her blue top, along with a second photo highlighting her pert derriere.

'dolce far niente,' she wrote, which is an Italian phrase that translates to 'pleasant relaxation in carefree idleness,' according to Merriam-Webster.

The DJ may have been planning out her Mexican trip late last month when she showed off another two-piece suit, this time a white design covered in pink and purple flowers.

Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic pandemic, both Chantel and Drew seem to have been traveling across the US and throughout North America.

In the same post from August 30, she included snaps of the two lovebirds while visiting Maine.

She beamed in a gray sweatshirt and tiny black shorts while blocking out the sun with thin black sunglasses.

Drew embraced her in one selfie and wore a charcoal sweatshirt and an intriguing set of angular pentagonal sunglasses.

'Straight up *vibing*,' she captioned the pictures.

Chantel, who was previously linked to Machine Gun Kelly, Justin Bieber and Diplo, was first linked with Drew in February.

She showed the relationship was heating up late in July with an Instagram photo shared with her 4.7 million followers of the two kissing while dining outdoors.

She shared the post the same day that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lambasted Drew's group The Chainsmokers for 'egregious social distancing violations' after the performed in front of a packed crowd with few mask wearers at a Safe & Sound charity event in New York's Southampton.
