McKinnon, 36, who's known for her hilarious RBG impersonation on Saturday night Live, released a touching statement Friday.

She wrote in a statement to TVLine: 'For so many of us, Justice Ginsburg was a real-life superhero: a beacon of hope, a warrior for justice, a robed crusader who saved the day time and again.

'Playing her on SNL was a profound joy because I could always feel the overwhelming love and gratitude that the audience had for her. It was one of the great honors of my life to meet Justice Ginsburg, to shake her hand, and to thank her for her lifetime of service to this country.'

The comedian recently received her eighth Emmy nomination for her role on SNL, where she frequently plays Notorious RBG on Weekend Update.

Jones, 36, who portrayed Ginsburg's life story in the 2018 biopic On the Basis of Sex, also expressed her condolences.

She told People: 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave us hope, a public figure who stood for integrity and justice - a responsibility she did not wear lightly.

'She will be missed not only as a beacon of light in these difficult times but for her razor-sharp wit and extraordinary humanity. She taught us all so much. I will miss her deeply.'

The Academy Award-nominated actress played Ginsburg as a young lawyer, joining the fight for equal rights.

She told Yahoo at the time: 'I feel that she’s a pioneer. She’s someone who has pushed back against injustice. 

'And someone who definitely understood injustice because she’d gone through it herself and then harnessed the anger that she felt in an incredibly productive way and gives us hope that change can happen.'

Justin Theroux, who also starred in the film as ACLU legal director Mel Wulf, also took to Instagram with a tribute, sharing photos of himself meeting Ginsburg.

He wrote: 'I am heartbroken. I have no words for the hole that has just been blown through us. Thank you for your service Justice Ginsburg. We’ll miss you RBG. I love you Ruth.'

Kathy Bates, who played the late judge and activist Dorothy Kenyon, wrote on Twitter: 'RBG 'Now she belongs to the Ages.' Stunned. Heart broken and very afraid. We must take up her mantle.' 

Ginsburg died Friday, September 18 at 87 years old, surrounded by family at her home in Washington DC.

She was the second female and the first Jewish female justice of the Supreme Court, nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

The Brooklyn-born activist, who dedicated her career to gender equality, previously brought six cases before the Supreme Court, winning five. 

According to NPR, she dictated her final wish to her granddaughter Clara Spera, days before her death: 'My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.'

Within 24 hours of her passing, Republican Senators Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham have expressed their support for President Donald Trump's nomination for her seat, just 47 days away from his own reelection.

They've been met with stark disapproval, as they both blocked President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in February of 2016, when Justice Antonin Scalia died 270 days before that year's presidential election. 

Trump later said Saturday at a North Carolina rally: 'I will be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. I think it should be a woman because I actually like women much more than men.'

It came just days after model Amy Dorris accused the president of sexual assault during the 1997 US Open, recounting her story Thursday to The Guardian, making her at least the 26th woman to accuse him of sexual misconduct since the '70s.
