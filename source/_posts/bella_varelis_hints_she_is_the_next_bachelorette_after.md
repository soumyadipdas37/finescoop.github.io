She was brutally dumped by Locky Gilbert during the shock Bachelor finale on Thursday, after the hunky Survivor star told her he loved her.

And while she is still licking her wounds Bella Varelis is moving on.

The 25-year-old digital marketer said she is keen to be Australia's next Bachelorette during a radio interview on Thursday morning.

Australia, meet your next Bachelorette! Bella Varelis has hinted she is going to star in the reality show after getting brutally dumped by Locky Gilbert during The Bachelor finale on Thursday evening 

The brunette beauty insisted to radio hosts Daniel 'Gawndy' Gawned and Maz Compton that you can really find love on a reality TV show.

'I know that you can genuinely find love on The Bachelor or Bachelorette, I genuinely did fall in love with Locky and I mean, if the way I find my happily ever after is having to make one of them end up saying yes to me a the end, I guess maybe that’s my way in,' she said 

'I don’t know, it would be nice, I have been one of the girls, I think I’d have empathy with how they are feeling and being in that position.'

Bella was left shell-shocked during Thursday's episode when Locky told both her and love rival Irena Srbinovska he loved them both - only to dump her. 

He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.

'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.

'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'

As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'

She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'

After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena, telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her.

But it turns out there may have been more to the story.

Some pretty wild rumours about the season finale surfaced overnight - and if they're true, Locky has a lot of explaining to do.

As reported by gossip website The Wash, the former Survivor star's 'last blindside' was even more brutal and confusing than what was shown on TV.

While viewers saw Locky, 31, tell Bella, 25, he was falling in love with her during their helicopter date, things reportedly didn't end there.

He allegedly texted the marketing consultant before filming their last goodbye to 'reassure her' she would be his winner - making his eventual decision all the more hurtful and bewildering for her.

The website quoted an anonymous source, who had been 'present for the majority of filming', as saying: 'Locky gave her a lot of reassurance that it was going to be her at the end.

'He even texted her saying he couldn't wait to make her happy for the rest of her life and talked about engagement rings. It has been heart-shattering for her. Bella really thought this was going to be her happily ever after.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.

During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both women he was falling in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.
