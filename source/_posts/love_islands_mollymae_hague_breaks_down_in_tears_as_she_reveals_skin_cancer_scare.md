Molly-Mae Hague was moved to tears on Saturday as she tearfully recalled her skin cancer scare.

The Love Island star, 21, revealed she'd visited a doctor three times after noticing a mole on her calf, before reassuring followers that the mark turned out to be non-cancerous.

Molly-Mae added that it was her mum Debbie who first noticed the mole while she was in the Love Island villa, and pleaded with her fans to get any unusual marks checked out. 

Scary: Molly-Mae Hague, 21, was moved to tears on Saturday as she tearfully recalled her skin cancer scare

In a series of videos she posted to Instagram Stories, Molly-Mae admitted she'd been moved to tears after watching a Stand Up To Cancer segment about Emily Hayward.

She died in June 2018 after being diagnosed with skin cancer seven years earlier when she was just 17, and documented her battle with the disease on a YouTube channel. 

Molly-Mae then told her followers she'd found a similar mole on her calf when she was in the Love Island villa last year.

Concern: Molly-Mae then told her followers she'd found a similar mole on her calf when she was in the Love Island villa last year

She explained: 'And I actually found a mole on the back of my calf about a year or so ago and had it checked, obviously I'm so blessed that mine wasn't cancerous, but it just made me so upset that like ''what does she do to deserve that? Who deserves that?''

'It is just the worst thing in the world. It's just to comprehend for families that have to go through it, how much of a struggle it must be for people who actually deal with cancer. It just broke my heart watching that.'

Molly-Mae went onto urge her followers to get any unusual moles checked out, and shared a snap of the one she'd noticed on her calf.

Close call: After reassuring fans that her mole turned out to be non-cancerous, she urged them to get any unusual ones checked out 

She said: 'Get your moles checked out people!!! It is so unbelievably important. I've had this checked three times now by different consultants just to be sure.

'This just appeared out of nowhere for me and my mum actually noticed it when I was on Love Island through watching me on TV...' 

Elsewhere, Molly-Mae recently revealed it won't be long until she and her beau Tommy Fury start a family. 

The media personality was quizzed by fans about her plans to have a baby during an Instagram Q&A, where she told her followers she has always seen herself as a young mum.

Speaking out: 'This just appeared out of nowhere for me and my mum actually noticed it when I was on Love Island through watching me on TV...' she told her followers

When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.'

The blonde also answered the question: 'If you could meet Tommy again without the fame, would you?' 

She replied: 'Well this is the nice thing about how we met, we met on Love Island and I didn't know who he was, he didn't know who I was. It was a really natural and nice way of meeting.' 

Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. It happens after the DNA in skin cells is damaged (typically due to harmful UV rays) and then not repaired so it triggers mutations that can form malignant tumors. 

Around 15,900 new cases occur every year in the UK, with 2,285 Britons dying from the disease in 2016, according to Cancer Research UK statistics. 

Causes

Treatment 

This can be done by removing the entire section of the tumor or by the surgeon removing the skin layer by layer. When a surgeon removes it layer by layer, this helps them figure out exactly where the cancer stops so they don't have to remove more skin than is necessary. 

The patient can decide to use a skin graft if the surgery has left behind discoloration or an indent. 

This is needed if the cancer reaches stage III or IV. That means that the cancerous cells have spread to the lymph nodes or other organs in the body.
