Sisters Elly and Becky Miles look for love side by side on the new season of The Bachelorette. 

And the pair have revealed how they handled the prospect of falling for the same manduring filming of the reality dating show. 

Speaking to New Idea magazine on Monday, Becky said the two sisters were determined not to let suitors come between them. 

Duo: In an interview with New Idea on Monday, Bachelorette sisters Elly, 25, (left) and Becky Miles, 30, (right) revealed how they avoided falling for the same man on the reality show 

'There were a few times where maybe both of us thought maybe someone was cute,' Becky revealed. 

'But then one of us would be like: ''I want to pursue something,'' So when Elly would say that to me, I was like ''yeah, you get it, girl''.'  

Elly went on to say she has never shared an interest in the man her sister was dating, instead thinking of him more like a brother.

Sisters first! Speaking of finding love, Becky said: 'One of us would be like: 'I want to pursue something,' So when Elly would say that to me, I was like 'yeah, you get it, girl'

'I'd never be like ''Oh, I'm going to see if I can get in myself'',' she added. 'It would never go that way.'   

The girls, however, did say they would be looking for someone who is down-to-earth, positive and respectful on the show.       

On Saturday, Elly and Becky revealed they have both found love on the show with Becky telling Stellar: 'We're very happy with our fellas.'

While the double Bachelorette surprised many fans of the show, the sisters could not be happier taking that journey together.

In a trailer for the show, Becky tells her sister, 'I want to find love next to you. It will be magical,' as they prepared to meet their Bachelors. 

Elly's appearance on The Bachelorette comes after she found herself being sent home by Matt Agnew on The Bachelor last year. 

The brand new season of The Bachelorette will premiere on Wednesday, October 7 at 7:30pm on Channel 10.
