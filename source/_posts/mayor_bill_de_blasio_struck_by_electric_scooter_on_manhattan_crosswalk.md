Mayor Bill de Blasio was struck on the arm by an electric scooter as he stepped on to a crosswalk in Lower Manhattan.

The 59-year-old had been crossing the road at 10.15am on Monday when he was sideswiped by a man on the e-scooter. 

De Blasio escaped unharmed during the collision.

The rider, who was travelling with his seven-year-old daughter, had not been wearing a helmet, according to The New York Post.

It is thought that the girl fell off the device and tumbled to the floor - but both father and daughter suffered only minor injuries. 

The mayor reportedly checked on the pair immediately afterwards and offered a tissue to attend to minor scratches that were bleeding.

Bill Neidhardt, the mayor's press secretary, has since urged New Yorkers to take care and follow proper safety precautions.

He said: 'City Hall encourages everyone to obey traffic signals and wear a helmet.'

Earlier this year New York City Council voted on bills to legalize the use of electric bikes and scooters citywide.

Lawmakers had already approved the use of e-bikes and e-scooters statewide in April but the decision on how to regulate the vehicles was left to local officials.

It was hoped that a pilot program would also be created to bring a shared e-scooter program to neighborhoods currently lacking transit options and under-served by existing share programs like Citi Bike and Revel.
