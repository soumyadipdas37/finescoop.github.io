At the time he was married to Maria Shriver, the journalist who mothered of all his other children - Katherine, 30, Christina, 29, Patrick, 26, and Christopher, 22.

The actor hid the fact that he was Joe's father for 15 years. Mildred Baena had claimed the boy was the son of her now-ex-husband Rogelio Baena until 2011.   

Schwarzenegger and Shriver separated in 2011 after the Los Angeles Times revealed he had an affair and fathered his youngest son more than 14 years earlier.
