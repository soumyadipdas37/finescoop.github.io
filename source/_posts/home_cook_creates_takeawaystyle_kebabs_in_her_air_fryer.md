A home cook has recreated the popular takeaway-style kebabs at home using her air fryer.

The woman, from Melbourne, used a combination of lamb and beef mince, herbs and spices, onion, garlic, salt and pepper, bread crumbs and an egg to make her own rotisserie-style donor kebabs.

She insisted her homemade version tasted remarkably similar to kebab shops after she served the carved meat with wraps, mixed lettuce, tomato slices and garlic dip.

The woman, from Melbourne, served the sliced meat with wraps, fresh salad and garlic dip

'For dinner tonight, tried a recipe for takeaway style rotisserie kebab in the three-in-one air fryer. There's lots of ingredients, but surprisingly easy to make. Tastes exactly like a takeaway kebab,' she wrote in a Facebook group. 

In a large bowl, she mixed all the ingredients together until it's well combined.

She pointed out the recipe, which she found on social media, requires the ingredients to be blended in a food processor - but she ended up skipping the step.

'Didn't have a food processor at home so I was worried the mix wouldn't stay together on the rotisserie, but it turned out great,' she said.

The woman said she rolled the meat into a log shape and placed on the rotisserie to bake

The woman said she rolled the meat into a log shape and then wrapped it in foil before adding a second layer as this will 'hold it together better'.

She baked the meat on the rotisserie for 30 minutes in the first round so the ingredients are cooked through, while holding its shape in the air fryer.

The home cook then removed the foil from the meat, transferred it back to the air fryer and baked for a further 30 minutes or until the surface turned golden.

'Unwrap foil and back in to crisp up and finish cooking,' she added.

She carved the meat and served it with Mission roasted garlic-flavoured wraps and Yumi's garlic dip. 

The woman pointed out the recipe did not belong to her but she was inspired to create the dish at home after finding it in the Facebook group.

Many were amazed by the easy-to-make dish, while others said they were keen to make it for dinner at home. 

'Looks fantastic. I can't wait to try this,' one woman said, while another added: 'I didn't know you could make it so easy. Thank you for the recipe.'

INGREDIENTS

500g lamb mince

250-500g beef mince (to taste)

3 tsp cumin powder

 3 tsp ground coriander

2 tsp onion powder

3 tsp garlic (powder, jar or fresh)

2 tsp ground cinnamon 

2 tsp ground paprika

1/2 tsp black pepper

2 tbsp olive oil

2 tbsp salt

3 tbsp parsley (dry or fresh)

1/2 cup bread crumbs

1 egg



METHOD

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Place mixture into a food processor for about a minute until combined.

Roll meat into a log and wrap in foil. Wrap second layer of foil as it'll hold together better (make sure log isn't longer than your rotisserie stick)

Place the meat on the rotisserie and bake for 30 minutes in the air fryer at 180°c. 

Unwrap the meat from the foil and let it sit for a few minutes, then bake it on the rotisserie for a further 30 minutes, or until the surface is golden.

Remove the meat from the air fryer and allow it to rest for a few minutes. Carve the meat thinly with a knife.

Serve with warm wraps or Lebanese flat bread, fresh salads and sauces.
