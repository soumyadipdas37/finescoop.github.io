Author and broadcaster Loyd Grossman checks into our travel Q&A

This week author and broadcaster Loyd Grossman checks into our travel Q&A.

He talks about his earliest holiday memory, in New York, his favourite part of the U.S, his top destination in the UK - and more...

EARLIEST HOLIDAY MEMORY?

As a child growing up in America in the 1950s, I'll never forget visiting New York after Thanksgiving one year and seeing the window displays in the big Fifth Avenue department stores.

FAVOURITE PART OF THE U.S?

I grew up in Boston, New England, and love Maine's rocky Atlantic landscape.

FAVOURITE RESTAURANT?

I adore the Minetta Tavern in Greenwich Village. It has the most wonderful 'New York in the 1920s and 1930s' feel and serves amazing hamburgers.

TOP TIPS FOR VISITING THE U.S?

Explore small-town America — you'll find it fascinating. And remember that American coffee can be quite weak — it's why diners offer you endless refills.

MEMORABLE PLACE?

Loyd says that the most memorable place he has ever visited is the South Pacific island of Bora Bora, pictured 

The South Pacific island of Bora Bora. I got to go scuba-diving and saw lots of varieties of shark.

They're the most fascinating creatures in the wild.

WHERE DO YOU LIKE IN THE UK?

I've just discovered north Norfolk with its stunning beaches, churches and delicious food. I ate the most amazing crab there.

ANYWHERE ELSE YOU WOULD RECOMMEND?

Gladstone's Library, which is an extraordinary monument to one of our great Prime Ministers, in beautiful North Wales.

DREAM DESTINATION?

Loyd's dream destination? Peru or Ecuador. Pictured is Machu Picchu in Peru 

Peru or Ecuador, to see the heartland of South America's ancient civilisation.

A SILVER LINING TO NOT TRAVELLING?

Definitely. It's a chance to remind ourselves just how many wonderful places there are in the UK.

WHERE NEXT?

Sicily — as long as it's not on the quarantined list.
