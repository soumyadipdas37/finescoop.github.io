West Brom manager Slaven Bilic will consider signing former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor this summer, according to The Sun. 

The 36-year-old is out of contract after leaving Paraguayan club Olimpia, and the Baggies may offer him a deal if they fail to sign a marksman before the extended window closes on October 13. 

The report claims Bilic has already entered talks with the Togo international, who is desperate to return to the Premier League before he retires. 

Emmanuel Adebayor has become a surprise transfer target for Premier League West Brom

Adebayor has scored 97 goals in England's top flight and has been training twice a day at his home in Ghana in hope of being given an opportunity to take his tally to a century.  

Turkish club Fenerbahce have also shown interest in Adebayor, but the veteran forward has expressed his desire to join a fifth Premier League club of his career.  

He arrived in England upon leaving Monaco for Arsenal in 2006 in a deal worth £3million, scoring 62 goals in 142 appearances before joining Manchester City in 2009.

Adebayor ran the length of the pitch to taunt Arsenal fans after scoring for Man City in 2009

Adebayor memorably taunted Gunners fans by running the length of the pitch to celebrate in front of them after scoring for City in a 4-2 victory.

The Lome-born star enjoyed a loan spell at Real Madrid then joined Tottenham, netting 42 goals in 113 games over four years with the North London club. 

A disappointing stint at Crystal Palace followed in 2016 before the former African footballer of the year turned out for Istanbul Basaksehir, Kayserispor and Olimpia.
