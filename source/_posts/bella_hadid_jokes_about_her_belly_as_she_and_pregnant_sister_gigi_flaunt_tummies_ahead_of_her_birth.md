Bella Hadid celebrated her sister Gigi's pregnancy while poking fun at her own tummy in a new Instagram.

The model siblings looked like two peas in a pod in younger sister Bella's latest Instagram, where both beauties pulled up their shirts to reveal their midsections.

Gigi, 25, was proud to flaunt her burgeoning bump while Bella, 23, joked: 'Two buns in the oven except mine is from my burger and gigi’s is from @zayn.'

'I love you both so freaking much,' the IMG beauty went on while adding an angel emoji.

Gigi certainly looked angelic, donning a loose, off-white maxi-dress which draped over her bump elegantly.

Getting emotional about being an aunt for the first time, Bella continued '-Can’tstopcryin.'

She dated the photo 'june 11, 2020,' meaning it was taken back when the sisters were still quarantining at mom Yolanda's Pennsylvania ranch.

Gigj responded with her own string of emojis in the comment section, sharing three big grins and another angel emoji.

 33 weeks ♡

The expecting model's little girl should be coming very soon.

At the end of August the elder Hadid revealed a series of stunning Vogue portraits where she gazed directly at the camera while cradling her third-trimester bump.

One of the photos was captioned '33 weeks,' meaning Gigi and on/off boyfriend of five-years Zayn Malik are on the last leg of the pregnancy.

The exact timeline is a bit unclear, however, as it's not known if Hadid meant she was 33 weeks along at the time of posting or when the photos were taken in July.

If she was counting down from July that would put the star at 40-weeks any day now.

Gigi confirmed her pregnancy in April, after 'family sources' first revealed the news.

She said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. 

'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.'

However, the celeb remained tight-lipped about the pregnancy, saying she thinks it's 'not the most important thing going on in the world.'

Hadid added: 'That's a reason that I felt that it's not really something that I need to share apart from with my family and friends.

'Obviously a lot of people have lost lives due to [the] coronavirus that was in the beginning of quarantine and still happening,' she said.

'And then we moved obviously into the reemergence of the BLM [Black Lives Matter] movement, and I thought that our presence on social media should be used for that.'
