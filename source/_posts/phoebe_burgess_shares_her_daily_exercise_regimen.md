She's the former NRL WAG known for always looking her absolute best.

And on Wednesday, Phoebe Burgess revealed the secret to achieving her incredible figure as she shared her daily exercise regimen to Instagram.

'There is simply nothing better than squeezing in your daily exercise - without even realising it! I'm going to call this "incidental activity" that can accidentally contribute to your physical (and mental) strength,' she wrote.

'Whenever I need to raise my heart rate a little , I'll either challenge the kids to a race or throw one on my back for a trip to the chooks,' she continued.

She went on to say she also enjoys going for a swim and visiting the beach with her two children son Billy, one, and daughter Poppy, three.

'In summer it's daily swimming lessons and playing in the sand at the beach,' Phoebe said.

'But nothing really beats the simple things at home - horse riding with the kids, pushing them on the swings and jumping on the trampoline are all my accidental cardio,' she continued.

'For me, these are all the little ways and things I do as part of my own daily rituals to help me feel at my best and get some Vitamin D outside,' she added.

The couple married in 2015 at her parents' country estate in Bowral, but separated in September last year.

After their split, Phoebe re-located to the affluent rural town where she's living at her parents country estate.

In April, the couple finalised their divorce with The Daily Telegraph reporting that she got '70 per cent' of the couple's marital wealth.
