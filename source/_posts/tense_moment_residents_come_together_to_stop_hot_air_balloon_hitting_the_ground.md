This is the moment local residents helped to move a huge hot air balloon away from a cycle path after it dropped from the sky.

The incident was filmed in the municipality of Nijkerk in the central Dutch province of Gelderland, and the footage was shared by Corlaer College Secondary School.

After the hot air balloon operator got into trouble and lost altitude, nearly landing on the college’s cycling path, bystanders leapt into action to guide the basket away from the populated area.

Around a dozen members of the public help to keep the hot air balloon basket off the ground in Nijkerk, the Netherlands

In the video footage, around a dozen residents are seen keeping the balloon’s basket, with a number of passengers still on board, above ground.

Meanwhile, the operator tries to make the balloon stay in the air by applying the thrust.

The cameraperson then pans in on the huge balloon extending high above the nearby treeline.

A large crowd of pedestrians and cyclists can be seen congregating behind the obstruction as helpers try to guide it away from the path.

According to reports the balloonist was able to reach a safe clearing to land the balloon and resolve the issue.
