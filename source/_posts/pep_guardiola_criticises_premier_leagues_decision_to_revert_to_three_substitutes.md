Pep Guardiola criticised the Premier League reverting to three substitutes as a tactical decision made by teams outside the top six.

Clubs were permitted to making five changes per game in three intervals during Project Restart but a majority voted against keeping that rule this season.

The five-substitute regulation did, in theory, advantage the clubs with larger squads - something the Manchester City manager vehemently disagrees with.

‘The argument that it favours the top five or top six is because the people don’t understand absolutely anything,’ Guardiola said. ‘The guys who are going to finish below those six teams, the teams that people suggest are the stronger, will have the same problem as all of us.

‘They have games every three days. And there is a way just to protect the players. We have to protect the business, yes, but we have to protect the players, and with five substitutions we protect the players. Forget about tactics, forget about which favourite team is going well.’

The numbers on the bench have also been reduced from nine to seven and Guardiola warned against the safety of players with fewer numbers.

‘I don’t understand why,’ he added. ‘We finished the season late, and started quickly. How can we not protect the players with five substitutions?’
