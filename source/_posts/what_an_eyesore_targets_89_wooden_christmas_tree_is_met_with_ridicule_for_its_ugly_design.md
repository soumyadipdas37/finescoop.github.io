The $89 Wooden Scandi Christmas tree from Target Australia is being ridiculed for its 'ugly' design compared to artificial trees made with realistic leafy branches.

The Target tree stands 1.5 metres tall and is made from multiple wooden sticks of varying lengths that turn in different directions to resemble the shape of a tree.

A skeleton-like staff holds the tree in upright on a circular wooden plank and a star is also placed on top.

The tree caught the attention of shoppers after a woman shared a photo to the Target Mums Australia Facebook group.

'Saw this in store recently. Does anyone have one? Considering purchasing one but wanted to know what anyone else has done with it,' the mum said online.

The post sparked a division between customers as many said the tree looked like a pile of 'sticks' and isn't worth the price. 

'What an eyesore,' one woman said, another added: 'Worth $25, no more.'

'80 bucks?? Surely that's not right,' a third said.

'I remember collecting sticks as a kid and making these trees all over our farm,' another commented.

While some weren't impressed with the wooden design, others said they would pay hundreds for a similar style.

'I love this style! I have been quoted $800 for something similar and think $89 is a bargain!' one woman said.

'I would definitely pay $89 for it, I was thinking of getting one when I saw it in store the other day!' another said.

Another woman said she bought a similar tree from Adairs a few years ago, and admitted the style isn't for everyone.

The unique design has been around for several years, as in 2016 radio host and mum Bec Judd shared an image of her wooden Christmas tree on Instagram (pictured)

It was decorated with ornaments to add some colour and sparkle to the wooden Christmas tree, which she said is made from recycled branches. 

Target also sells a miniature table version of the tree for $25 which can be purchased in stores and online.
