Ellen show executive producer Andy Lassner told fans it's been 'a couple rough months' for him and the production as they continue to deal with controversy around the daytime show.

The Emmy-winner producer returned to Instagram for the first time in over a month on Sunday, opening up with the public after three of his fellow executive producers were fired in response to allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct. 

While Andy, 53, admitted things have been 'rough,' he also took an optimistic tone, saying: 'When we go through these things, I guess, when we learn the most about ourselves, and maybe even some growth.'

Andy's quick update come in the form of a video, where he addressed the camera head on. 

'Oh look who it is. If it isn't Andy Lassner,' he said. 'Well, yes it is. Your eyes do not deceive you. I'm back. 

'I've been away for a little bit, dealing with — you know, some stuff. You may have read about it,' Andy went on, only hinting at the shakeup behind the scenes on the syndicated show.

'It's been a couple of rough months,' he continued. 'But it's when we go through these things, I guess, when we learn the most about ourselves, and maybe even some growth.'

Still, Lassner - who has been with the Ellen show since 2003 - was frank about the controversy and its public fallout, saying: 'But to tell you it hasn't been rough would be a lie, and I've always been honest with you. It's been rough. But I'm back.' 

'I love you guys, I miss you and I'll talk to you soon,' he finished. Echoing that sentiment in his caption, Andy added: 'I've missed my people.'

Andy alluded to the controversy earlier this month, tweeting: 'Me: I really think 2020 is gonna turn around and start getting better. 2020: Lol, I’m gonna make your bed the epicenter.'

The Ellen show has been on break since July 9th when the 17th season wrapped and is slated to return for its 18th season September 9th.

This comes after three of the show's top producers, Ed Glavin, Kevin Leman and Jonathan Norman, were let go after an investigation from parent company WarnerMedia.

Andy and fellow executive producers Mary Connelly and Derek Westervelt will stay on. They will be joined by former show DJ Stephen 'tWitch' Boss, who earned a promotion to co-executive producer.

Ellen is said to be just as excited to return and 'reset' the atmosphere on set, with a People insider saying: 'She’s been dying to see [staff and crew,] that she couldn’t because of the investigation and she really wanted them to hear from her that this is a reset, things are changing and things are going to be better moving forward. And she’s committed to that.'

The claims of a toxic workplace first made headlines in mid-July when BuzzFeed News published a report in which former and current employees claimed they had encountered racism, fear and intimidation during their time on the show.

The show then faced additional accusations about sexual misconduct in a second BuzzFeed News article on July 30, in which dozens of men and women accused Leman, Glavin and Norman of sexual harassment, misconduct or assault.

WarnerMedia launched an internal investigation conducted by a third party and on Monday, in an email to employees, David McGuire, executive vice president of programming at Warner Bros., said the current investigation 'is nearing its conclusion.'

Other changes promised by DeGeneres and the studio were announced earlier this month.

Going forward, staff will be given five paid days of leave plus a paid day off on their birthday and paid time off for doctor's visits and family matters.

DeGeneres, 62, launched her chat show in 2003, five years after her sitcom Ellen went off the air after five seasons.

In April 1997, the comedienne and actress made headlines when she came out as gay on an episode of the show. A year later, ABC pulled the plug on the sitcom.

In 2008, she married actress Portia de Rossi and in addition to her successful daytime chat show on NBC, she has hosted the Academy Awards, the Emmys and the Grammy Awards.
