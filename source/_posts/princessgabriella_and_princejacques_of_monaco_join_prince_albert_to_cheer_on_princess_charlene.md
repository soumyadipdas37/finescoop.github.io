The challenge, which sees two teams of four internationally renowned athletes take turns to 'cycle' 180km from Calvi, in Corsica, to Monaco.  was launched by the royal to raise awareness and funds for her foundation’s activities. 

Meanwhile her husband Prince Albert, 62, and children Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques cheered on from the sidelines .

Prince Albert donned a facemask as he joined his wife alongside their young children to pose for snaps ahead of the challenge.

Later, the family hopped into a boat to watch on as Princess Charlene began her grueling 24 hour challenge. 

The event will benefit the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation and raise awareness of its programmes including 'Learn to Swim' and 'Water Safety', which have been implemented around the world. 

Since the creation of the Princess Charlene Foundation in 2012, more than 730,000 people, particularly children, have benefited from these three programmes in 34 countries.

The royal launched the 24 hour challenge earlier today in an effort to raise funds for her royal foundation 

Zimbabwean-born Charlene is a committed philanthropist and often draws on her athletic connections to raise money for the fund established in her name.

The Princess of Monaco represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and later retired from professional swimming in 2007. 

Other athletes involved in the race include retired UFC star Conor McGregor, Olympic gold medallist, Yannick Angel, and Australian racing cyclist, David Tanner.

Charlene and Albert tied the knot in 2011 after five years together, going public with their relationship at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

Prince Albert is the son of Princess Grace and Prince Rainier III of Monaco.

In early March, Prince Albert became the first head of state to test positive for COVID-19.  

He was monitored by his personal doctor and by specialists at the Princess Grace Hospital Centre, which is named after his mother Grace Kelly. 

He told PEOPLE at the time that he experienced mild flu-like symptoms, saying: 'I've a slight fever, not really that bad. A little bit of a cough. I'd a runny nose the first few days, that was the first sign. I've felt a little stuffed up but that's it,' he said.  

The mother-of-two and their twins, Jacques and Gabriella, lived separately to Albert while he was in isolation.

The adorable youngsters wore matching sunglasses and donned sun hats as they waved their mother off on the charity challenge

Speaking on how the family kept in touch, Albert told People magazine: 'We FaceTimed — usually in the evenings. We told stories and talked about what we did during the day. 

I told [the twins] to be safe. They knew I was sick and that I had to stay away. I'm hoping I get a 'Welcome Home' banner.' 

After he spent several weeks self-isolating in the palace, the royal returned to his family.
