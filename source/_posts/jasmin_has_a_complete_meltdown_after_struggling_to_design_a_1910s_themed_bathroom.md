The Block's Jasmin had a complete meltdown during Monday's episode, leaving her husband Luke confused about what brought on her sudden emotional outburst. 

Struggling to design a 1910's themed bathroom, an overwhelmed Jasmin, 36, confessed she 'didn't have much to work with'.

After deciding everything in the bathroom should be white or a pale grey in keeping with the designs of the time period, she admitted she wasn't loving the aesthetic.

Overwhelmed: The Block's Jasmin had a complete meltdown during Monday's episode, leaving her husband Luke confused about what brought on her sudden emotional outburst

'They have no storage,' she complained, but conceded, 'They do have toilets. We were wrong, we thought they had long drops, but they did have toilets.'

Jasmin described their design for the bathroom as 'clean and safe', and admitted she was nervous about taking any risks after losing the previous challenge.

'But you do have to have some sort of "wow" factor in there, don't you,' she added, explaining they were planning on installing a 'fluted glass' shower screen.

A producer then asked how the fluted glass shower screen fit in with the era, and Jasmin admitted it didn't, as shower screens were nonexistent during the 1910's.

'Well, they didn't actually have shower screens, so I can have no shower screen and a shower curtain, but I don't think the judges would like that either,' she said dryly.

She was then asked if she was 'happy' with the design, and a clearly unhappy Jasmin simply shrugged and responded: 'I have to be happy.'

But just 20 minutes later, she had a complete meltdown while in the car with Luke, leaving her husband baffled as she sobbed beside him in the passenger seat.

'I just feel like I'm going to cry. I just can't hold it in anymore,' she sobbed, her hands covering her face. 

'Why?' asked a clearly confused Luke, 35, from the driver's seat.

Feeling insecure: Jasmin admitted her confidence had taken a hit after they lost the last challenge, and confessed she was now 'doubting everything'

Jasmin admitted her confidence had taken a hit after they lost the last challenge, and confessed she was now 'doubting everything'.

'I'm just sad. I'm mourning my Block loss, because I wanted to come on this show and do something amazing that I really love,' she explained.

'I did not want to come on this show and be pigeonholed into doing something that I don't want to do.'
