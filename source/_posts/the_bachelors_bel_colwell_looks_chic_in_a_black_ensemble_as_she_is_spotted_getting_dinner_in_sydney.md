She failed to receive a rose from The Bachelor's Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert during last week's virtual rose ceremony.

But on Friday, Bel Colwell appeared to be anything but heartbroken as she was spotted making her way to dinner with a friend in Sydney.

The 25-year-old star looked impeccably chic in an all-black ensemble which consisted of a long sleeve sweater and black high waisted jeans.

She accessorised her look with a matching handbag and white sneakers. 

Bel wore her signature blonde tresses out, and appeared to be wearing little makeup for the occasion.

The sighting comes just days after she was sent home on the Channel 10 dating show.

Weird: Speaking about her eviction, the media buyer told Who magazine that being sent home during 'love in lockdown' was a bizarre and lonely experience

Speaking about her eviction, the media buyer told Who magazine that being sent home during 'love in lockdown' was a bizarre and lonely experience. 

'I don't recommend it to anyone... There's a red rose just staring at you and then you just close the laptop,' she said. 

'Obviously, it's better to be with everyone because you can hug everyone goodbye and have a moment with Locky if you need it for that closure,' she added.

Bel, who was at her home on the night she was sent packing, only had her producer to turn to for comfort after being abruptly cut off the Zoom call.

'It was nice, he sat with me in the house afterwards and asked me if I was okay,' she said.

At the end of last Thursday's episode, the series' first-ever virtual rose ceremony saw each of the remaining ladies standing by a rose.

However, they could only pick it up if Locky called out their name.

After Bel failed to receive a rose, she waved goodbye to the other ladies before her screen abruptly blanked out.
