Olympic beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings has apologized after she sparked backlash for going shopping without a face mask in 'a little exercise in being brave'.

'My goodness gracious. To those I’ve upset so deeply, I am sorry,' she shared Tuesday, sharing an Instagram of a white flag and the word 'Truce'. 

'To those calling me dumb, selfish, privileged, bigoted, and racist... I fully acknowledge that addressing such an emotional, layered, nuanced and polarizing topic on social media was not the smartest thing,' she added.

Walsh Jennings, who defied Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) measures in refusing to wear a mask, said she was only trying to express her belief that 'FREEDOM IS A [sic] RIGHT WORTH FIGHTING FOR'. 

'I believe we have to stay mindful of the FACT that our freedoms have slowly been taken from us with our consent,' she said.

'My goodness gracious. To those I’ve upset so deeply, I am sorry,' she shared in an Instagram apology on Tuesday, adding 'I was not looking to do anything but express my belief that FREEDOM IS A [sic] RIGHT WORTH FIGHTING FOR'

Walsh Jennings, who won gold medals in beach volleyball in 2004, 2008, 2012 and bronze in 2016 in Rio de Janiero, said she is 'not advocating for people to stop wearing masks'

'I am not advocating for people to stop wearing masks. I wear a mask most often. I don’t believe in their efficacy unless it’s of a certain caliber, yet I wear them. I am advocating critical thinking and civility. I am advocating personal responsibility,' she added.  

In her controversial post late Sunday Walsh Jennings, who is looking to represent the US in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, said: 'I had a little exercise in being brave yesterday & I'm still a bit edgy about it. I went shopping without a mask on [sic] & this is why ... I read a quote the other day that shook me.'

'THIS HAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED, IT'S BEEN CONSENTED TO,' Walsh Jennings wrote.

She said that the quote 'woke me up & the truth of it has had me obsessing on the matter of how I can mindfully & compassionately stand up for my rights & for the freedoms our constitution has granted us all WITHOUT being reckless or putting anyone else in danger.

Backlash: Instagram commenters said Walsh Jennings confused freedom with common good







'We are all endlessly complaining about the restrictive & arbitrarily selective rules that we are being strongly "suggested" to follow & yet we are all consenting; Not much of a fight, just a lot of complaining & strongly disagreeing with this manipulation, but we keep consenting. 

'It's maddening. It has crushed our society, people's livelihoods, our children's spirits, & the fabric of our world. We have become a country & a world estranged from each other & it is more deeply unhealthy than any virus could ever be,' she added. 

Walsh Jennings said that she's aware that many people have been sickened by COVID-19 and many have died. There are more than 6.3 million cases in the US and at least 189,000 deaths.  

'I would never downplay the impact of a single loss of life. That is it's own conversation & my heart goes out to all those suffering poor health, the loss of a loved one and the fear that the reaction to & media coverage of COVID-19 has created in your days,' she wrote.

Olympic volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings explained in a lengthy Instagram post that she chose not to wear a mask inside a store as part of a 'little exercise in being brave'.

She said that the quote 'woke me up & the truth of it has had me obsessing on the matter of how I can mindfully & compassionately stand up for my rights & for the freedoms our constitution has granted us all WITHOUT being reckless or putting anyone else in danger'

Walsh Jennings described her interactions at the store as 'incredibly uncomfortable'. She then continued her thoughts in the comments section of the post by advocating for people to start or continue 'to live healthy lives'. 

'Eat well and eat real food. Prioritize sleep. Move and get your heart working every day. Pay attention to your breath and perhaps start a breath work protocol to work and strengthen your lungs. Get outside. Think good thoughts. 

'KNOW your immune system is designed to support you through any illness -- we must support our entire system. I want people to stop living in fear and start living in a way that strengthens themselves body, mind and spirit.'

Since the pandemic began in mid-March, Walsh Jennings has been doing online talks with young volleyball players, including one with the team at her alma mater of Archbishop Mitty High School in California. 

Through her volleyball and lifestyle platform p1440, Walsh Jennings put together an online program mixing skills, fitness and mindset training. 

The four-week pilot called 'The Fundamentals' sold out in six days with 250 men, women, boys and girls of all ages, volleyball rookies up to semipro level.
