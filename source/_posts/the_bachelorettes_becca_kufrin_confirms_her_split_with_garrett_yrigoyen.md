Becca Kufrin confirmed that she and Garrett Yrigoyen have officially called it quits after two years together and admitted that the news would not 'come as a shock to anyone'.

The 30-year-old Bachelorette star addressed the much talked about end to her engagement on the latest episode of her Bachelor Happy Hour podcast with co-host Rachel Lindsay.

Kufrin said the couple is heading down different 'paths' and that decision to split 'wasn't based solely off of one Instagram post' - a caveat made after Yrigoyen was accused of posting racially insensitive comments on social media.

'I don't think it's going to come as a shock to anyone, but Garrett and I have decided to end our engagement,' Becca said during the podcast episode.   

'Garrett and I came to this decision after many conversations. It wasn't just something we just arrived at one night,' she continued. 'It wasn't based solely off of one Instagram post or somebody else's opinions or comments. 

'There's much more to it. To any relationship, there's a lot of layers. It's not for me to divulge details. It's no one's business other than what I'm telling you right now.'

The publicist's comments about Instagram was in reference to the backlash Yrigoyen faced when he shared his support for the 'thin blue line' during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests.

The posts did not sit well with fans, who had not forgotten how Garrett had 'liked' various homophobic and racist Instagram posts on Instagram back in 2018. 

The couple were able to move past the controversy at the time, but the thin blue line post may have been the last straw. On a previous episode of her podcast, Becca admitted she did not agree with Garrett's post, and acknowledged they were trying to 'work through' their problems.    

However, there doesn't seem to be any animosity between the former pair in the wake of their split.

When addressing her relationship this week, Becca said they 'realized that we still have so much love and kindness and compassion in our hearts for the other person, but sometimes people's paths just go different ways.' 

'We went on this crazy TV show over two years ago in hopes of finding love, and we were lucky enough that we did,' she said during the podcast. 'We really, truly did. I'm so grateful for that opportunity and to have had the two-plus years with Garrett.' 

The confirmation comes after after eagle-eyed fans noticed last week that Garrett had removed a highlight reel of Becca, entitled 'Becca Spills,' which contained clips of his fiancee. 

As for why she didn't choose to speak out sooner, the Bachelor Nation star said she 'didn't think it was fitting to bring anyone else into this conversation when my relationship was only made up of two people: myself and Garrett.'

Interestingly, their calling it quits comes nearly the two year anniversary of Becca's season finale on The Bachelorette, which saw Garrett propose to her in the Maldives. 

'We went on this crazy TV show over two years ago in hopes of finding love, and we were lucky enough that we did,' she said during the podcast. 'We really, truly did. I'm so grateful for that opportunity and to have had the two-plus years with Garrett.' 

Controversy: The couple's split comes after Becca admitted they were 'working' on things following fan backlash to Instagram comments made by Garrett about the 'thin blue line' 

She went on to say that she still has 'love and compassion' in her heart and that the end to their romance doesn't 'take away all of the years and the countless memories'. 

Adding: 'I will always look back at this time in my life with so much gratitude and love.'   

Becca rose to fame as the winner of season 22 of The Bachelor and the star of the subsequent season 14 of The Bachelorette. 

During the finale of her Bachelorette season in 2018, she chose Garrett over runner-up Blake.

'I will always look back at this time in my life with so much gratitude and love,' Becca told Rachel
