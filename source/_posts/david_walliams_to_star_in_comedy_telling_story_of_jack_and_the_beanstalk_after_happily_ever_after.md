David Walliams and Sheridan Smith are set to star in a new Christmas comedy telling the story of what happened to Jack following the story of Jack and The Beanstalk.      

The Little Britain creator, 49,  has co-scripted the story of 'Jack & The Beanstalk: After Ever After' for Sky, which follows on from the channel's successful production of 'Cinderella: After Ever After' last festive season. 

It will tell how the Giant did not in fact die after falling from the beanstalk, but was simply concussed and left no way back to his house in the sky.

Jack's now needs to think on his feet in order to outsmart the angry villagers and get the giant home.

David - who also stars as the Giant - said: 'I often wondered what happened to Jack after ever after, so I decided to write a sequel because I can't stop writing books!

'This is a star-studded festive treat - a comedy sequel to one of the best loved English fairy tales. 

'I am delighted to be playing the Giant, alongside some of the biggest names in British TV.'

Cilla star Sheridan Smith, 39, will play giant killer The Woman With No Name, while Blake Harrison, 35 - who played Neil in The Inbetweeners - is set to appear as Dodgy Dave.

Sheridan said: 'This is a brilliantly funny piece and I'm so excited to be working with David again. 

'After the year we've had it's the perfect story for Christmas that the whole family can enjoy together.' 

Production is set to get underway next month. Jon Mountague - director of comedy at Sky Studios - commented: 'Christmas is a time for love and cheer. And beanstalks.  

'David Walliams has bought a fairy tale cast to deliver a genuinely unique twist on an absolute classic.'

There are also plans in place for a third 'after ever after' programme, that will continue the story of 'Hansel & Gretel'.
