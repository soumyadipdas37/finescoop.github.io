Paul Pogba is reportedly waiting for a chance to return to Juventus next year and is therefore stalling on a renewal of his Manchester United contract. 

The Frenchman, who moved from the Old Lady to United in 2016 for a then-world record deal of £89m, has constantly been linked with a return to the Serie A champions. 

With Andrea Pirlo, who Pogba played alongside in midfield during three of his four years in Turin, now the manager at Juventus, the 27-year-old is reportedly eyeing a reunion for 2021, according to Italian outlet Tuttosport.

The report, which is the cover of Saturday's edition, claims that Pogba is stalling on signing a contract extension at Old Trafford, because he is waiting on a return to Italy. 

The French World Cup winner currently has a deal at United until next summer, though there is an option to extend that by a year to 2022. 

Any developments are not expected to take place this summer, with Pogba currently satisfied with the situation under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after United qualified for the Champions League. 

Pogba in particular flourished post-lockdown, forming an impressive midfield partnership with January signing Bruno Fernandes.

The United midfield was strengthened further this week when United completed the £40million signing of Donny van de Beek from Ajax.  

Yet the situation and link between Pogba and Juve could resurface in January, with Pirlo said to be keen on bringing in the playmaker. 

The pair won three Serie A titles together and reached the final of the 2014-15 Champions League, losing out to Barcelona in Berlin.

After originally coming through the United academy, Pogba moved to Juve on a free transfer in 2012, and it was in Turin where he first broke through on the European stage.   

Pogba last week became the latest high-profile player to test positive for coronavirus, with the new season starting on next week, on September 12. 

That being said, due to their exertions in the Europa League last month, United's first game is not until Saturday, 19 September, when they host Crystal Palace.
