Kick It Out have urged clubs and the authorities to help reveal the true level of abuse in football after their figures highlighted a staggering rise in discrimination across the game.

Kick It Out’s annual report highlighted that claims of discrimination in professional football had risen 42 per cent, racist abuse was up 53 per cent and there was a 95 per cent increase in gender-based abuse.  

Chairman Sanjay Bhandari warned that his organisation’s figures are just 'the tip of the iceberg'. He said: 'We only report what is reported to us.

'We need to aggregate the data across Kick It Out, clubs, law enforcement, governing bodies and others so that we have the complete picture to give us a greater chance of finding better solutions together.'

Last season was again blighted by players being targeted with racial abuse on social media. 

Bhandari said: ‘Football and social media can be a positive force but in order to tackle online hate, everyone needs to do more. We need better regulation and enforcement and we need social media companies to be part of the solution.’
