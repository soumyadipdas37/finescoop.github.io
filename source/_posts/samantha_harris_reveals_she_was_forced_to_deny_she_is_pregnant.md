Model Samantha Harris has never been shy to speak out against her detractors. 

And the 30-year-old didn't hold back when she took aim at a journalist for questioning whether she was pregnant during a live TV cross on Monday morning. 

'So I’m not one to usually write a post like this but this has just really rubbed me up the wrong way today,' she fumed in an Instagram post hours after the incident.

'This has just really rubbed me up the wrong way': Indigenous model Samantha Harris, 30, (pictured) has taken aim at a journalist for questioning whether she was pregnant during a live TV cross on Monday morning 

The Indigenous catwalk star explained that she was preparing to film a segment for Monday's Today show when her agent began talking to a journalist about her over the phone. 

'I overheard the conversation asking if I’m pregnant because there’s been rumours getting around for a while now that I am,' she explained. 

'Needless to say I was not impressed,' she raged, adding that she found the question 'so rude'.

'Seriously, where do rumours like that come from? What are they implying? Are they trying to say I’ve gained weight or something??' the star continued.   

Samantha, who has been married to husband Luke Hunt in 2014, proceeded to set the record straight on the pregnancy speculation. 

'If and when I do fall pregnant it will be up to myself and my husband to whom we share that information with and if we let media know at all,' she declared.

Samantha became a household name after she won the Girlfriend Model Search at the age of 13.

By the age of 18, she became the the second Indigenous model to ever appear on the cover of Vogue.
