North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un gushed to President Trump in a private letter that meeting him was 'reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film,' it was revealed Wednesday.

Kim referred to Trump in letters as 'your excellency' – an exalted term usually favored by royalty,' according to Bob Woodward's new book, 'Rage,' which includes portions of what Kim wrote to Trump. 

Trump has referred to writings exchanged by the two men as 'love letters,' but has refused to disclose them, even while teasing their contents to the press.

North Korean dictator King Jong-un refers in a letter to Trump to 'another historic meeting between myself and Your Excellency reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film,' in a letter quoted by Bob Woodward in his book

In one letter excerpted in the book, King refers after a summit to 'another historic meeting between myself and Your Excellency reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film.'

He called his Trump meetings a 'precious memory' and said it showed that the 'deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force.'

The two men met first in Singapore in 2018 after having traded bellicose rhetoric, then later met in Hanoi. In June 2019 the two men met when Trump walked from South Korea across the DMZ.

'I feel pleased to have formed good ties with such a powerful and preeminent statesman as Your Excellency,' Kim wrote Trump, in excerpts published in the Washington Post. 

Deploying flowery language, Kim – who holds hereditary rule in a regime that has relied on terror and featured famine – fondly recalled 'that moment of history when I firmly held Your Excellency's hand at the beautiful and sacred location as the whole world watched with great interest and hope to relive the honor of that day.'

He said Kim 'tells me everything' – including what the Post termed a 'graphic account' of having his uncle Jang Song Thaek (r) killed

Trump name-checked Kim in a conversation with Woodward while dissing former President Barack Obama. 

 'I think he's highly overrated. And I don't think he's a great speaker,' Trump said of the noted orator. He said Kim thought Obama was 'an a******.' 

Trump shared with Woodward that he found Kim 'far beyond smart.' He said Kim 'tells me everything' – including what the Post termed a 'graphic account' of having his uncle killed. 

Kim's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was reportedly executed by a firing squad of anti-aircraft guns. A defector told CNN he was forced to watch the murder of his colleagues and blood was poured on his face.
