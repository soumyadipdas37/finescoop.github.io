Jose Mourinho has taken a swipe at Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after he made light of the Tottenham manager measuring the goalposts at Shkendija. 

Mourinho ordered UEFA to change the goalposts at the North Macedonian club's ground after he and his players realised the crossbar was five centimetres too low during the warm-up. 

Solskjaer then made fun of Mourinho, who is himself a former Red Devils manager, following United's dramatic 3-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday. 

Jose Mourinho has taken a swipe at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after his goalposts jibe by suggesting the Manchester United manager is more focused on the 'dimensions of the 18-yeard box'

Mourinho had to get UEFA delegates to switch posts at Shkendija as they were 5cm too short

After a match in which Brighton hit the woodwork a record five times, Solskjaer told Sky Sports: 'We got away with one, to be fair.

'When they equalised I thought that's two points lost. Maybe one point was what we deserved – I don't think we deserved more but the character we showed deserved more.'

'We have to be grateful Jose (Mourinho) is not here to measure the goalposts, it might have been smaller goals.'

Mourinho decided to bite back in his pre-match interview before Tottenham's clash with Newcastle, alluding to the high volume of penalties awarded to Man United

Solskjaer joked that he was glad Mourinho had not measured the goalposts before United's clash with Brighton. Albion hit the woodwork five times at the Amex, a Premier League record

'I know the goalposts are fine,' Mourinho told Sky Sports. 'I think Ole yesterday was so happy and surprised with what happened to his team that he had a joke, but I understand that for him the dimensions of the goalpost are not important.

'For him, what is important is the dimensions of the 18-yard box. He would never accept to play with a 17-yard box I think he would prefer a 22-yard box. For him would be better.'

United were awarded 22 penalties last season and have continued in similar form in 2020-21, winning two spot-kicks in their first three games in all competitions. 

Bruno Fernandes converted United's latest penalty to score a 100th-minute winner on the south coast, securing a first Premier League victory of the season.
