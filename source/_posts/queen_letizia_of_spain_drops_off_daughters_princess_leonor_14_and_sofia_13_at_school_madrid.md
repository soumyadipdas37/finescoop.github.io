Queen Letizia of Spain looked elegant in a white blouse as she dropped her teenage daughters off at school today. 

Letizia, 47, donned a face mask as she drove her daughters Leonor, 14, and Sofia, 13, to Madrid's Santa Maria de los Rosales' School.

Classes restarted earlier this week and it was father King Felipe of Spain who was on hand for the school run. 

But today it was proud mother Letizia's turn and she appeared in good spirits as she joined other parents in their cars.

Heir to the throne Leonor and younger sister Sofia, both wearing face masks, waved to cameras as they climbed the steps to the school before having their temperature checked by a member of staff. 

It comes days after Spain became the first country in Western Europe to register 500,000 coronavirus infections, with a second surge in cases that coincided with schools reopening. 

It is believed that Princess Leonor is starting of fourth year of secondary education, while her younger sister Princess Sofia is beginning her second year at the school. 

It has been a challenging summer for the Spanish royal family, after runaway former King Juan Carlos caused shockwaves around the country in August by announcing he was leaving his homeland.

Princess Leonor has now been deemed by some as a saviour of the monarchy, with  The Times writing: 'Attention must turn to the future if the Bourbon monarchy is to survive.

'It is a responsibility that rests of the shoulders of Leonor, and the reigning king, Felipe VI, knows that, as he introduces her to the country while trying to modernise the monarchy.' 

The publication went on to say the young princesses are 'the future for a modernised monarchy.'

'Leonor is still very young, but modern, well-educated and a woman — which is important as the feminist movement grows in Spain,' a palace source reportedly said. 'She is a great asset.'

Leonor made her public-speaking debut at at awards ceremony in Barcelona last November, where she gave comments in Spanish, Catalan, English and Arabic.

Meanwhile, she and Sofía read from Don Quixote on World Book Day in April, and addressed the nation in a video amid the coronaviurs pandemic. 

Her return to school comes as Spain struggles to control a recent spike in infections amid schools reopening across the country.

Recent infections have been more common among younger people who often develop no symptoms thanks to their stronger immune systems, and the death rate remains far below the March-April peak when daily fatalities routinely exceeded 800.
