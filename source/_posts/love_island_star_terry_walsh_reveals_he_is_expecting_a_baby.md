Love Island 2016 star Terry Walsh is expecting his first child. 

The carpenter, 33, who was involved in one of the show's most controversial moments when he had an over-cover romp with his ex-girlfriend Emma-Jane Woodhams, is set to welcome a baby with his stunning fiancée Danielle Purdy.

Danielle, a bio energy healing therapist for people and equine, shared a stunning snap of the duo on Instagram last week, in which they showed off their baby scan just weeks after the reality hunk popped the question. 

 The best birthday present I could ever have wished for was seeing our baby again today ☺️ so special. We are absolutely over the moon to be expecting! We can’t wait to meet our little darling. Due February 21 ���� love you so much already! @terry_walsh88

Terry shot to fame alongside Love Island icons including Alex and Olivia Bowen, Nathan Massey and Cara De La Hoyde in 2016. 

While they all went on to seek showbiz careers, Terry, who was romantically involved with Malin Andersson and Emma-Jane Woodhams, bowed out of the spotlight soon after he established himself as reality hot property. 

Now, after his time away, he is set to become both a husband and a father with his stunning fiancée, who shared the news with her 1,448 followers. 

Sharing the incredibly sweet snap, Danielle penned: 'The best birthday present I could ever have wished for was seeing our baby again today ☺️ so special....

'We are absolutely over the moon to be expecting! We can’t wait to meet our little darling. Due February 21 love you so much already! @terry_walsh88'.

In August, she confirmed their engagement with a sweet selfie alongside the caption: 'Last night I said yes to becoming Mrs Walsh...

'Even though we were meant to be in Paris this weekend and this wasn’t quite what he had planned, it couldn’t of been more perfect I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with my best friend @terry_walsh88 I love you so much'.

Terry joined the show shortly after the launch, initially falling for Olivia, neé Buckland, before ditching her for Malin, who was then voted off.

His relationship with Emma flourished soon after her arrival in the house, in which she entered as the girlfriend of Tom Powell, with the duo growing ever closer much to Malin's chagrin on the outside as she watched on. 

As their romance developed, Emma and Terry stunned fans and co-stars when they had sex in the communal bedroom without shielding themselves with a duvet.

Emma revealed she had decided it was better to bed Terry without any covers to conceal the deed, as she believed it wouldn't be aired on TV.

Unbeknownst to her, however, the scenes had played out on the show meaning it wasn't just her fellow islanders that had a front row seat, which eventually led to ITV being bombarded with complaints from stunned viewers.  

The couple's actions led to a backlash from viewers, prompting complaints to be raised about the steamy scenes, but Love Island was later cleared by watchdog Ofcom who said 'no rules had been breached' by the show.

Seeming to express her regret over her actions once filming had wrapped, Emma later told new! magazine: 'There's not a day goes by I don't wish I hadn't done that.'
