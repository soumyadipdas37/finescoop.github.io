Chelsea are eager to sign West Ham midfielder Declan Rice before the closure of the transfer window.

Frank Lampard wants to bring in a defensive midfielder and Chelsea are set to make a bid of more than £40million before the October 5 deadline, as reported by The Sun.

Chelsea are confident of signing the England international as they believe that West Ham are desperate for funds.

Rice, who was released by Chelsea as a 14 year old, has already made 100 Premier League appearances at the age of 21. 

His contract runs until the summer of 2024, but West Ham could be tempted to sell him, especially with co-chairman David Sullivan admitting that the club have found it difficult sign new players due to a lack of funds.

Chelsea have been heavily active in the transfer market, securing deals for Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva, Kai Havertz and Edouard Mendy.

However, it seems clear that it may take some time for Lampard to figure out how to get the best of the players at his disposal.

Chelsea have taken four points from their first three Premier League games and had to come from three goals down to draw 3-3 away to West Brom on Saturday.
