A burglar penned a handwritten note from behind bars threatening to make his victim's 'baby girl' disappear if the father didn't retract the statement he made to police. 

Jordan Constable, 36, also offered to pay the victim $10,000 in exchange for positive statements while he was on remand at Fulham Correctional Centre in Victoria's south-east.

The threatening letter was sent to the victim's Hallam home, in Melbourne's south-east, in March 2019 when the 36-year-old was in custody for the crime. 

'I see how much you adore and love your baby girl … it would be hard as (a) father knowing you could prevent your daughter disappearing but did nothing, or the wrong move instead of following orders and making a healthy 10k of which will help your retirement,' the letter read.

'Don't f**k this up – for your baby girl's sake.'

Last month Constable pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice at the Victorian County Court, NCA Newswire reported.

On Thursday he was spared jail time and was instead sentenced to a three-year community corrections order. 

The letter arrived at the victim's house about two months after Constable robbed it, and the victim immediately reported it to police.

Constable, a father of five, was then sentenced to 217 days jail and an 18-month community corrections order for the burglary in September 2019.

'I really don't care exactly what is said just retract all negative statements against Jordan all items returned as his possessions, make a positive statement … you are covered by insurance so make sure you get IT DONE!!,' Constable wrote in the letter.

Constable told the victim to tell police he was 'emotional' on the day he gave the 'negative' statement and to instead make up a story that 'Jordan is a close friend of the family'.

While the letter had been signed 'Mr K', analysis from another letter matched Constable's handwriting.

The victim and his wife said they had been 'devastated' by the crime and the danger their daughter - who was pregnant at the time - was in.

The victim's wife told the court that Constable had 'invaded every inch' of their life.

She asked her daughter to move interstate with her husband out of fear for her safety.

Judge Michael McInerney issued a warning to Constable, saying if he breaches his community corrections order he will be sent 'straight to jail'.

Prosecutors pushed for Constable to be jailed for the letter but his defence lawyer said it was 'spontaneous' as he was recovering from a drug addiction.

Constable will have to undergo drug tests and offender behaviour therapy while completing 200 hours of community work as part of the order.

He was also ordered to pay $3,000.
