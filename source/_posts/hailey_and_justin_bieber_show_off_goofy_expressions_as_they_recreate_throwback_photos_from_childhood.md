Hailey and Justin Bieber were feeling nostalgic on Tuesday as they tried to recreate some hilarious photos from when they were just little kids.

The 23-year-old model posted a humorous photo to her Instagram Stories of herself and her pop star husband before comparing her look to a childhood snapshot.

Justin, 26, joined in on the action with his own goofy take on a vintage photo.

Blast from the past: Hailey Bieber, 23, and her husband Justin, 26, both shared cute photos of themselves recreating funny childhood poses Tuesday on Instagram

Justin started the nostalgia trip when he shared a cute photo of himself and Hailey aboard a private jet.

The two were enjoying sushi boxes from the Katsuya offshoot Krispy Rice and may have been returning to Los Angeles from their recent trip to Idaho. 

The Sorry singer sported a shaggy quarantine hairdo and a dark t-shirt, while Hailey wore a black jacket over a matching tank top. 

The model scrunched up her face and stuck her tongue out playfully while Justin played it straight.

Later, Hailey shared a cute side-by-side comparison of herself sticking her tongue out when she was just a tiny tot, next to her present-day self. 

Time flies: Justin shared a photo of the two aboard a private jet, and Hailey juxtaposed her extended tongue with a cute photo of herself making the same face when she was a child

Justin joined in on the fun with a short video that was also shared in Hailey's Insta Stories.

She started by zooming in on his phone, on which he had a funny picture of himself with a strained smile and bulging eyes as he stood next to a friend.

Hailey pulled back the camera and panned over to Justin's face to reveal his updated attempt at the crooked smile.

'OMG,' she captioned the hilarious expression.

On his own Instagram page, Justin shared some more meditative photos of himself.

He gazed off into nature while standing against in Idaho after the sun had just gone down past the horizon.

The Love Yourself singer looked as if he was deep in though or praying in a follow-up picture taken in his driveway.

He stood against his tan car with his hands clasped as he looked downward with a somber face.

The singer–songwriter wore an olive toque and a fuzzy white shirt over a white tank top and khakis with yellow, white and red trainers.

He let both photos speak for themselves and didn't bother to caption them. 

Justin gave his 147 million fans a closer look at his new rose neck tattoo with its barbed stem in a closeup selfie featuring the same outfit that he posted to his Insta Stories.

Earlier on Tuesday, Hailey and Justin were spotted in Beverly Hills as they stepped out for lunch together.

The couple recently returned from their picturesque road to Idaho, where they shared some lovely snaps from Lake Coeur d'Alene.

Hailey shared a cute photo of the married couple embracing on a boat, as well as a shot that showed off her trim physique and her black bikini.

The daughter of Stephen even has a tattoo reading 'coeur d'Alene' under her left shoulder blade, though it's for her sister Alaia's middle name, rather than the popular tourist attraction.
