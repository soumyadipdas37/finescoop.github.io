She kickstarted her modelling career by being featured in an Intimissimi's catalogue in 2013, which led to a print campaign in Forever 21.

Since then, she went on to become a popular Victoria's Secret Angel, beginning in 2015, and has appeared in many of the top high-fashion publications and fashion shows around the world.
