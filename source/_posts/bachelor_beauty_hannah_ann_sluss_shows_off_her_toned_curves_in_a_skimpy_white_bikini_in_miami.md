The finalist on Peter Weber's season of The Bachelor was seen frolicking around Miami with a friend on Friday as they took a break from work to soak up some Florida rays.

The model turned reality television star, took to Instagram Thursday to announce that she was back at her 'old stomping grounds' turning to her 1.3M followers for weekend recommendations while down south. 

For her beach outing, Hannah kept it cohesive in a matching white outfit as she fit right in with Miami locals, showing off her popping backside and sunkissed skin.  

The Tennessee-born beauty opted for a skimpy white high rise bikini that hugged her killer figure, riding slightly up her behind as she strolled along the water.

Protecting herself from the sun, Hannah wore a plunging linen wrap top that exposed a hint of her cleavage and tummy. 

She matched the top with a pair of white palazzo pants, and accessorized the look accordingly with a gold necklace, oversized gold hoops and a pair of light framed sunglasses. 

Leaving her brunette locks down to achieve optimal beach waves, Sluss chatted with her friend while dipping her toes in the water. 

The TV personality was seen holding onto a cocktail in a plastic cup as she indulged in a relaxing day in the Miami heat.

Earlier in the day Hannah posted that she and her friend had had a productive day after spending a rainy Thursday night relaxing in their hotel and ordering room service. 

'This is one of the first nights I can just chill' she said, adding that she felt super tired and her feet were swollen from the flight. 

The friends woke up bright and early Friday, and got to work in the gym before getting their brunch on with some guacamole and celery.

 On Thursday the television fan favorite seemed to throw subtle shade at ex-fiance 'Pilot Pete', 29, as she modeled in a wedding dress to Ariana Grande's 'thank u, next' on her Insta-story. 

Captioning the video of her sashaying in the floor length lace gown, Hannah wrote 'the lyrics on point'. 

The post comes less than a year after Sluss was snubbed by Peter on television in March after the pair ended the finale engaged.  

After the proposal, it was revealed that Peter had called things off a mere weeks after the show was filmed to move on with contestant Madison Prewett, before eventually dating his current girlfriend and ex-Bachelor contestant, Kelly Flanagan from his season.

Though her journey for love on the Bachelor did not work out, Hannah has remained in good spirits since the show. 

Speaking to US in early September, Sluss shared: 

'I feel like I’m on my third life now. Prior to the show was one life and then the show was my second life, being engaged included, and now I’m on my third life living in Los Angeles, being single and kind of just making the most out of this new life.'

During her time as a single Los Angeles lady,  the Southern belle has been working up a storm modeling for various brands, and indulging in classic Bachelor Nation privileges.
