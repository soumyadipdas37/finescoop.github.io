An angry animal rights group in Malaysia is offering a reward to trace the yob who painted a stray dog orange and black so it resembled a tiger.    

Persatuan Haiwan Malaysia, the Malaysia Animal Association, launched an appeal for information after the painted pooch was spotted walking down a street.

The group has now called on members of the public to come forward with any information which could help catch the culprit.

 It is not known if the local authorities are involved in trying to track down the culprit.

 Laura Francis, on Facebook, said: 'The dog's face is sad, such a shame.' 

Social media user 'Jessie Jye' said: 'The dog has to take a bath and have its coat shaved to get rid of all the chemicals. Sorry dog, remember the thug who did this to you.'
