She's no stranger to parading her enviable figure while out and about, and on Sunday she did it for the worldwide audience of MTV's VMAs.

And Madison Beer put her sensational figure on full display with a thigh-skimming black dress at the event, where she presented one of the newly baptized Moonpersons.

While flaunting her ample cleavage in a plunging neckline, the 21-year-old singer commanded attention in her semi-sheer ensemble, which hugged every inch of her toned frame.

The beauty showcased her toned and bronzed legs in the flirty black minidress, which hovered above her upper-thighs. 

In addition to a pair of matching open-toed heels, she donned a pair of black gloves, which came up to her shoulders.

Madison's luxurious blonde hair was flawlessly flat ironed, as she oozed confidence and pursed her plump pout on the red carpet.

In a departure from the regular proceedings, the singer presented a new VMA award, for Best Music Video From Home.

That award, recognizing efforts made my artists in the time of COVID and lockdown, went to Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, for their adorable quarantine-themed team-up Stuck With U. 

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event. 

Kicking up her heels: In addition to a pair of matching open-toed heels, Beer donned a pair of black gloves, which came up to her shoulders

Flawless: Madison's luxurious blonde hair was flawlessly flat ironed, as she oozed confidence and pursed her plump pout on the red carpet

This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.

MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’

The music network has stated that next year’s 2021 VMAs will once again be held at the Barclays Center.
