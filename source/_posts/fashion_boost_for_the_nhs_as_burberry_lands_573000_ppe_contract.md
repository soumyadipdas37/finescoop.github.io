Burberry has won a £573,000 PPE contract after donating gowns to the NHS.

The luxury fashion house has been handed the money to make personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.

The retailer had previously announced it would donate 100,000 items to medical staff back in April and was singled out for praise by Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

Two months later, Burberry was handed a £573,000 contract to make gowns and protective equipment.

The contract was not advertised to other potential suppliers, according to Government records published yesterday. 

EU rules allow the Government to circumvent the usual processes if only one supplier is capable of delivering on the contract, or if unforeseen events mean speed is vital.

During the early days of the pandemic several luxury fashion brands turned their production lines over to make desperately needed PPE.

Burberry’s Castleford site in Yorkshire retooled to produce gowns for healthcare workers.
