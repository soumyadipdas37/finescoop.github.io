Diane Keaton has no plans of ditching her Annie Hall glamour anytime soon.

The Manhattan actress opted for a laid-back version of her signature style while taking a walk with 20-year-old son Duke Keaton in Santa Monica on Monday.

While Diane, 74, kept on the felt hat and a tailored jacket, she gave things a California twist by donning cuffed jeans with the ensemble.

Her penchant monochrome patterns was on display via a polka dots scarf and a plaid face mask.

Subtly checkered shoes with a chunk heel completed the Academy Award winner's look.

Meanwhile, Duke looked like the typical 20-something, pairing a Jordan tank top with light slacks and sneakers. He added a red face mask to his look, per California safety standards.

This year Diane was mentioned in her ex-boyfriend Woody Allen's memoir Apropos Of Nothing.

In the tome, the controversial writer/actor/director, 84, said that he not only dated the actress, but also both of her sisters. 

'I dated her stunning sister, Robin, and we had a short romance,' Allen wrote in his book. 

He gets around: This year Diane was mentioned in her ex-boyfriend Woody Allen's memoir Apropos Of Nothing. In the book he mentions dating three of the Keaton sisters. The former couple are seen in 1977's Annie Hall together above

'After that I dated her different stunning sister, Dory, and we had a bit fling. The three Keaton sisters had been all stunning, fantastic ladies.'

For Allen fans, this awkward situation might sound familiar - seemingly the inspiration for 1986's Hannah And Her Sisters - which starred Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest.

Allen met Diane when she tried out for a role in his 1972 comedy Play it Again, Sam.
