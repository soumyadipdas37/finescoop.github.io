Destiny's Child singer LeToya Luckett is speaking out about the hardships she faced when leaving the platinum-selling band back in 2000.

Speaking to fans via an Instagram Live on Sunday evening, LeToya, 39, explained her 'uncomfortable' transition into a normal routine, after living in the fast-lane throughout her teenagers years, alongside Beyonce and Kelly Rowland in the heady days of being in the group.

LeToya first joined the foursome in 1993, but she and other band member LaTavia Roberson, 38, ended up getting replaced by Michelle Williams, 41, and Farrah Franklin, 39, before the release of their 2000 mega hit Say My Name. 

Candid: Destiny's Child singer LeToya Luckett tearfully reveals how she slept in a car after leaving the platinum-selling band in 2000, saying, 'It was terrifying'

'I wasn't the most secure person because I was so used to having a team mentality and to think of going out on my own was terrifying,' the singer told her followers that tuned in for the candid reveal.

'The thought of singing made me angry. I didn't believe I had a voice, I didn't believe I could sing, I didn't believe I could return to the music industry.'

'During my journey I was staying at people's house, I never told these stories before - I slept in a car in LA while I was making my first album,' she added.

Exit: LeToya and LaTavia were said to be pushed out of the band - pictured together in 1999 - despite being part of The Writing's On The Wall album, which became a best seller

'Not a lot of nights, but you know what I'm saying? I was drinking a gallon of water and buying the microwavable Oodles of Noodles. And I was like cooking them on the coffee pot in the hotel.'

She then became teary and started crying as she said: 'Yeah. It was a lot. I was uncomfortable for a minute.'

LeToya and LaTavia filed a lawsuit against Beyonce's father Mathew Knowles following their exit, though the dispute was later settled out of court.

The two members claimed that they weren't getting paid equally, among other complaints. 

The band - fronted by Beyonce - were arguably at the biggest tipping point of their career when the shake-up occurred, before they went on to become household names with the Charlie's Angels theme song Independent Women. 

However, not even Farrah Franklin got to see that success as she ended up quitting the band in July 2000.
