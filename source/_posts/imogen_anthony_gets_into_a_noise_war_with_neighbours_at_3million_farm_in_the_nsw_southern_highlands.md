Imogen Anthony has remained at the $3million farm in the NSW Southern Highlands, which she once shared with her radio host ex, Kyle Sandilands.

But despite living on 150 acres of prime land, Imogen, 29, still can't escape her noisy neighbours.  

Taking to Instagram stories to share her frustration, the blonde bombshell shared footage of what appeared to be her neighbours yelling and making loud noises.

'Oh god no,' she wrote over footage of her hitting her head while standing outside.

'I just heard them say they need to get five more in. They've only gotten two in twenty minutes...' she said in another video, which appeared to refer to the neighbours playing rounds of a ballgame. 

The 29-year-old Instagram model then calls out for help in another post, hoping for someone to save her.

In retaliation, the tattooed bombshell made her way inside her home, and blasted loud heavy metal music in an attempt to block out the noises coming from next door.

The first song shared to her Instagram was Limp Bizkit's 1999 hit Break stuff.

It comes after Imogen serenaded her pet camel in a rather amusing way.

The model serenaded the animal, lip syncing and dancing to the Lady Gaga track, You and I, sharing a number of video clips to Instagram back in July.

Staying put: Imogen and her ex Kyle have held onto their sprawling property despite their split  because their 100 rescue animals still live there, a spokesperson for the former couple said

She dramatically performed the lyrics, squatting and twirling in front of the unimpressed animal. 

Imogen and Kyle have held onto the sprawling property because their 100 rescue animals still live there, a spokesperson for the former couple said. 

'Kyle and Imogen will never sell the property,' the representative said when asked about the 61 hectare estate in Robertson, 90 minutes south of Sydney.

'The farm is home to over 100 rescue animals who'll continue to be cared for,' they added. 

The pair had named the property 'Crimson Peak' after its red A-line roof structure. 

During their eight-year relationship, Kyle and Imogen had also rented a $5,000-per-week mansion in Mosman and a 3,000-per-week home in Hunters Hill.   

Kyle announced the couple's split on air in November last year. 

He is now dating his former personal assistant Tegan Kynaston.
