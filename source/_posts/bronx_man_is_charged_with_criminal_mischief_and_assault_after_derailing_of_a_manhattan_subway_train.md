A Bronx man has been charged with criminal mischief after metal clamps were thrown on to New York subway tracks, causing a train to derail leaving injuring three people.  

Demetrius Harvard, 30, from the Bronx, was arrested immediately after the uptown A train was forced from the tracks as it arrived at Manhattan's 14th St - Eighth Avenue station.

The train pulled into the station at 8:17 am, and hit metal clamps which had been placed on the rails. 

Police believe the suspect found a pile of tie plates, which are normally used to secure the train tracks to the foundations, on a pile of construction materials at the 14th St. station.

Harvard allegedly tried twice to throw the plates onto the tracks, sources told the New York Post.

Harvard has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief, assault and criminal trespass

The first time the debris was thrown onto the tracks, a good Samaritan went down and retrieved them, the Post reports.

But Harvard allegedly put the plates on the tracks a second time, just before the train came into the station. 

When the train pulled in, three of the subway cars derailed - and Harvard was allegedly seen laughing as the train swerved.

'The investigation revealed that a 30-year-old male was seen throwing construction debris onto the northbound A-Train track which caused the first car on a subway train to derail upon entering the station,' NYPD said in a statement. 

Harvard has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief, assault and criminal trespass. 

Harvard was previously arrested on September 5 on charges of criminal mischief after allegedly hurling a metal bench through a bus window, according to the Post.

About 30 people were evacuated from the train, and they helped detain Harvard - who was allegedly spotted celebrating his accomplishment. 

Three passengers suffered minor injuries. 

One refused medical attention. Another was treated at the scene while the third was taken to Bellevue Hospital for further treatment, officials said. 

The wheels on one of the derailed train cars were destroyed in the crash, and a third rail in the station collapsed upon impact, knocking out power to all four tracks in the station. Other rails were also badly damaged. 

The power outage affected other trains on the line, with an A train becoming stuck in a tunnel beneath 34th Street.

All uptown A, C, D, E and F trains were being rerouted, causing extensive delays in Manhattan.
