Basketball Wives season five star Angel Love Davis shocked fans as she announced the birth of her second child on Instagram, Wednesday, as she never posted about her second pregnancy on social media.

The reality TV star spoke to People about the birth of her son Savior Amar, on May 23, after he arrived three months premature at just 28 weeks. 

'These past few months have been a real journey and one of my biggest blessings,' she wrote on social media about the journey since becoming a mother-of-two.

Surprise: Basketball Wives season five star Angel Love Davis shocked fans as she announced the birth of her second child on Instagram, Wednesday, as she never posted about her second pregnancy on social media  

Davis, 33, revealed that she went into her local Atlanta hospital for a routine checkup but was admitted after she was determined to be 'a risk for preterm labor.' 

'I found out my cervix was funneling,' she said. '[Which means] it was still closed at the bottom, but the top wasn't closed all the way, so it looks like a funnel. ... It was a risk for preterm labor.' 

While doctors gave her medications to help with the funneling she said 'it just got worse,' and that 'It got to a point where [my cervix] opened all the way. I was dilated 1 centimeter, and I was maybe 23 or 24 weeks,' and her baby was just two pounds. 

Davis, a registered nurse, said she was hoping to 'make it to 34 week,' as she kept her spirits up despite pandemic regulations making in-person visitors a challenge. 

Despite her water breaking at 25 weeks, the new mother-of-two said she as able to 'push off' delivery for another three weeks with medication and steroids to help the baby get 'stronger.' 

Struggles: The reality TV star spoke to People about the birth of her son Savior Amar, on May 23, after he arrived three months premature at just 28 weeks 

'They actually felt his leg,' she said of her first dilation check. 'He was about to walk on out!' 

She went on to call her son's strength 'amazing,' and despite being three months early he only needed bits of help from doctors and quickly learned on his own.  

'He didn't have to be intubated; he came out breathing on his own, which was all a blessing,' she said. 'He had some oxygen for a little while [and] a feeding tube, and that's just because of him learning to have that sucking reflex he just didn't have at that time because he still was a preemie. ... [Two weeks later] he started latching on to the breast.'  

Since welcoming her son premature, Davis said 'the hardest part' was her birth experience and 'not really knowing what was going to happen to my baby.' 

She revealed she worried if her son would survive and be healthy and she wondered 'What can I do to be the best mother that I can be to make sure that my baby is being delivered at the best health?' 

Having a baby in the middle of the global pandemic also was a hurdle for her as she did 'not really having a lot of support, due to COVID.' 

Big sister: Davis, is already mother to Heaven Love, age six, who she shares with her NBA player ex Dejuan Blair and her daughter is already loving being a big sister

The actress   revealed that while she has a nanny to assist in caring for her children Savior is an 'easy' baby and his sister is quickly stepping into her mentoring role. 

'For some reason, this baby isn't as hard as my first baby,' she dished. 'It's really easy. I have a schedule. It's not that hard at night — he wakes up every three to four hours, and I've got the bottles right there waiting.' 

Though she is focused on doing everything she can to make her son strong since coming home. 

Saying it's 'very, very important for premature babies to have mother's milk, the nutrients. And what I was told by my doctor was that the thing that [Savior] was lacking from being born early that he probably still was gonna get from [more time] being in utero, the milk actually produces that, as well.'

Davis, is already mother to Heaven Love, age six, who she shares with her NBA player ex Dejuan Blair. 

'Since day one, she's been very excited about being a big sister and helping out. Every day she's like, "Mommy, I want to help out as much as I can. I'm gonna do whatever you tell me to do,"' she said. 'It seems like she just grew up overnight.' 

Focus: For now, Davis says she is focused on her family, acting career while still being a nurse and running her Life Angeles medical apparel line 

The experience of welcoming Savior was much different than with Heaven, as her daughter was born 'full-term.'

'I never realized what it was like being on that other side of being a mother and you're battling going into preterm labor and maybe having a premature baby,' she said.  

Adding: 'It just all made me realize the blessings that everything comes with — just knowing that you're able to get pregnant, 'cause a lot of women struggle with even getting pregnant.'  

For now, Davis says she is focused on her family, acting career while still being a nurse and running her Life Angeles medical apparel line.  

'It was so nerve-wracking for me, so I was like, "I definitely want to share [my experience] with another woman [who's going through this], 'cause I know they're having the same concerns I'm having,"' she said. 

Adding: 'I want to let them know that I pulled through this, and they can get through this too.'
