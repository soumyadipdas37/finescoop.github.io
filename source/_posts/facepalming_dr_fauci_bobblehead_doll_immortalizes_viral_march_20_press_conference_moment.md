The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum is paying homage to Dr. Anthony Fauci with a bobblehead doll inspired by the infectious disease expert.

And in addition to bobbling his head, this doll also moves its arm in a perfect recreation of Dr. Fauci's viral facepalm moment.

The doll, which is available for pre-order now, is modeled to look just like a mini Dr. Fauci as he appeared in a March 20 press briefing, when he stood behind President Trump and brought his hand up to his face.

'Dr. Anthony Fauci has become America’s voice of reason as one of the lead members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force,' reads the item description

'Dr. Anthony Fauci has become America’s voice of reason as one of the lead members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force,' reads the item description.

'This special edition bobblehead features Dr. Fauci, who has served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.'

The $30 limited-edition doll was initially offered with either a red tie or a blue tie, but the blue tie version has already sold out.  

The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum will also be donating $5 from every Dr. Fauci Bobblehead sold to the American Hospital Association's Protect the Heroes Campaign to support the 100 Million Mask Challenge. 

Museum founders Phil Sklar and Brad Novak have made other bobbleheads by popular demand, including one for White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx

Gang's all here! Sklar and Novak said that they've seen a huge demand for bobbleheads inspired by public health officials and politicians, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo

Heroes: There is also an 'essential heroes' series with frontline workers 

Head to head to head: Another series features all 'three' Presidential candidates: Trump, Biden, and Kanye

This is actually the second Dr. Fauci bobblehead created by the museum, which debuted another version in April.

Museum founders Phil Sklar and Brad Novak told The Washington Post that 20,000 dolls were preordered within a week, and all 42,020 Dr. Fauci bobbleheads sold sold out by mid-august. 

Fauci himself thinks the popularity is more about what people think he represents.

'As opposed to that being a bobblehead of me, Tony Fauci, it’s really a bobblehead of the symbol of a person who they trust, and who they feel is giving them clarity and important information that they need, he said. 

Sklar and Novak said that they've seen a huge demand for bobbleheads inspired by public health officials and politicians, like White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.

'It was something that we had never seen before, in terms of people getting excited about their governors or their representatives,' Sklar said.
