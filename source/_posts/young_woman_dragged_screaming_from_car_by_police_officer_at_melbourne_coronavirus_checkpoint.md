Confronting footage shows the moment a young woman was dragged from her car screaming as she attempted to pass through a coronavirus checkpoint in Victoria.

Natalie Bonett said she was making her way through the COVID blockade in Wallan, north of Melbourne, on Sunday when she was stopped by police.

They informed her it was against the law to have her phone attached to a car charger which was mounted onto her windshield.

Following a brief and tense exchange, video shows the officer reach in and attempt to scoop up the masked woman and drag her from her car.

Ms Bonett screamed and resisted in the footage, demanding the officer stop touching her and get out of her car. 

A passenger in the car attempted to hold her back, trying to tell the officer she's 'got anxiety' while Ms Bonett became increasingly hysterical.

The disturbing footage ended as Ms Bonett slipped off camera and appeared to be dragged from the car.

'What the f**k are you doing, what the f**k, get off me,' she shouted at the officer. 

Moments earlier, the officer had given her an opportunity to state her name, and asked her several times to get out of the car.

'No, I don't feel safe. You're armed,' she responded.

The officer assured her she would be safe before eventually losing his patience and dragging her out himself.

Ms Bonett said she usually passes through the checkpoint with no issues, showing her license and permit to the officers on duty. 

She later revealed on Facebook she filmed her entire 14 minute arrest. 

'If you want to see the video.... you will all be disgusted. I am shaking, crying and in complete disbelief that I was treated this way.' 

Ms Bonett claimed officers called for backup when she wouldn't leave her car and that a total of four police officers eventually dragged her out. 

'They grabbed me by the legs and pulled me out of my car and arrested me,' she said.

'While trying to cuff me, they had their knees in my back and couldn't breathe.' 

She said she would 'mention more' when she was in 'the right headspace'.
