No Time To Die star Lea Seydoux has described her character's relationship with James Bond as 'a modern love story'.

The actress, 35, explained that fans will see a completely new side to the agent in the long-awaited 25th film in the series, as Bond settles down with Dr. Madeleine Swann after retiring from active service.

No Time To Die has been much anticipated by fans after it was delayed by seven months by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is set to be Daniel Craig's final appearance as the agent.

Speaking on the Official James Bond Podcast, Lea explained why it was so important to see Bond fall in love again after having his heart broken by Vespa (played by Eva Green) in 2005's Casino Royale.

She said: 'I think that it's also because of Bond and we needed Madeline to tell Bond's story I mean it was important to see Bond in love again because he had this relationship with Vespa but she betrayed him.

'But this time I think she's the real love in a way, I think it's really the film is a love story it's a story between the two of them so it's very unusual for a Bond film to see James Bond in love right? And I think it's quite modern in a way.

'In this film it's even more psychological and more emotional and I think that it's something that Daniel as James Bond created with this character.

'He created a character that is more vulnerable and who has flaws and I think that's what we like as an audience and it's true that James Bond is like a... it's not a real world right? But what we like is that in this world we can relate to the characters.'

The 25th film in the franchise finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help.

Leaving his seemingly happy live with Madeleine, Bond returns to the field to face Safin who is armed with a new dangerous technology that could impact the world.

Surprise! It's been heavily reported that No Time To Die will Bond become a father for the first time, after having daughter Mathilde with Madeleine

In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20, after originally being pushed back from its planned release in April.

It's been heavily reported that No Time To Die will Bond become a father for the first time, after having daughter Mathilde with Madeleine, who he met in the last Bond film Spectre.

In June, The Mail on Sunday confirmed rumours that the notorious womaniser spy is father to a five-year-old daughter.

The rumours emerged when call sheets – the daily schedules that tell actors where they are needed for filming – for the £150 million film, went up for sale on online auction site eBay.

The schedule describes a scene shot in southern Italy last September, which featured Dr Swann alongside Lashana Lynch's Nomi – who this newspaper previously revealed will be the first black female 00 agent – and a child called Mathilde, played by five-year-old Lisa-Dorah Sonne.

The podcast also saw star Lashanna Lynch discuss her character's debut in the series, as a new 00 agent Nomi.

She said: 'It turns into a mutual respect from each other because they come from the same programme, but she's definitely technologically more advanced.

'She's like she's had a James Bond file at home she's studying for two years and now she's had that opportunity to sit down with him and tell him exactly what she thinks...

'It's a really powerful moment because he's stopped in his tracks by a woman who does the same thing as him and we've never seen that before.'

No Time To Die will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.
