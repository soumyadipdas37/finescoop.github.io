An Australian veterinarian is among 42 crew still missing after a live export ship capsized in the East China Sea.  

Lukas Orda, from the Gold Coast, was on board Australian-owned Gulf Livestock 1 when the captain sent a distress call to the Japanese Coast Guard at about 1.20am on Wednesday.

Mr Orda and his wife Emma welcomed their first child, Theo, six months ago.

A Filipino crew member (pictured) who was rescued after a distress signal was sent by the Australian owned Gulf Livestock 1 said the ship capsized and sunk in rough weather caused by Typhoon Maysak

He moved to North Queensland from Germany as a child before taking up studies at James Cook University after high school.

Mr Orda was working with horses on the Gold Coast before joining the live export carrier as a vet in June, the Townsville Bulletin reported. 

The Gulf Livestock 1 left New Zealand on August 14 and was due to arrive at the Port of Jingtang in Tangshan, China on Friday.

Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship and the remaining 42 crew members which include 38 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia

The vessel had almost 6,000 cattle on board when it disappeared west of Amami Oshima in south-western Japan.  

Japan's coast guard dispatched planes and rescue boats to hunt for the ship and late Wednesday found a sole survivor - the ship's 45-year-old Filipino chief officer.

Dramatic photos released by the coast guard showed the man floating in the darkness in an orange life jacket and being pulled onto a boat with a rope as rescuers battled violent, rolling waves.

He was quickly brought to a large vessel, where coast guard personnel with surgical masks and gloves wrapped him with blankets.

'Water,' said the man, who identified himself as a Filipino in the video. 'Thank you, thank you very much.'

Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship and the remaining 42 crew members which include 38 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia. 

Based on the last known location of the ship it would have been sailing in high winds of 58 knots (107km/h).
