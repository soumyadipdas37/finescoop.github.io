Britain has recorded another eight coronavirus deaths today in the preliminary count as daily fatalities remain in single digits for the fourth day in a row.

NHS England reported seven of the fatalities and Scotland suffered one death, while Wales recorded zero. Northern Ireland is still to publish its figures.

The preliminary total is calculated by adding up fatalities in all of the home nations, but it does not include deaths in care homes and in the community in England.

It means the official figure announced later by the Department of Health has the potential to be higher.

Yesterday there were three deaths attributed to Covid-19. On Monday that figure was two and on Sunday there was just one victim.

Meanwhile, the Northamptonshire town of Corby and South Tyneside could be next to be hit with lockdowns amid an uptick in Covid-19 cases in the last week, analysis shows.

Corby, in the East Midlands, now has the third highest coronavirus infection rate in the country after 41 people tested positive in the last seven days.

The town of about 62,000 people now has a case rate of 56.8 per 100,000 people, according to analysis of official data by the PA news agency.

It puts Corby behind only Bolton, which has a rate of 59.1 per 100,000, and Pendle, 71.7 per 100,000 - where tough Covid-19 restrictions are already in place.

Meanwhile, South Tyneside in the North East has had 62 new cases in the last seven days, pushing its infection rate up from 11.9 to 41.1 cases per 100,000.

The metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear, home to 150,000 people, is now the ninth worst-hit region in England.  



It means South Tyneside and Corby are the only regions in the top 10 infection hotspots where restrictions have not been introduced. 

The rise in Corby comes after a bar worker in Wetherspoons tested positive for the disease.

The worker had taken a Covid-19 test and was waiting for results but turned up for work at the Samuel Lloyd pub at Rockingham Leisure Park anyway.

Boris Johnson was roasted for 'mess after mess' in the coronavirus crisis today after the government performed another embarrassing U-turn on lockdowns. 

Bolton and Trafford were among a series of areas in the North West due to see restrictions eased today.

But the move was abandoned at the 11th hour after a furious backlash from local politicians including Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who said infection levels were still far too high. 

As the dramatic volte face emerged, Mr Johnson was lashed by Keir Starmer at PMQs for 'making it up as he goes along'.

'It's mess after mess... U-turn after U-turn, it's a fundamental issue of competence,' the Labour leader raged.

'God knows what's going on, there's no grip.'

But a clearly stung PM retorted by branding Sir Keir 'Captain Hindsight'. 

Announcing the latest abrupt change of heart this afternoon, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: 'Following a significant change in the level of infection rates over the last few days, a decision has been taken that Bolton and Trafford will now remain under existing restrictions.

'This decision has been made in collaboration with local leaders after reviewing the latest data. We continually monitor outbreaks across the country, and have seen infection rates increase more than three times in Bolton in under a week, and double in Trafford since the last review.' 

They were sent home after it emerged they had the disease and colleagues were told to self isolate, the Northampton Telegraph reported

It's unclear if they infected others or whether the case is to blame for the overall spike in Corby. 

Other areas where there has been a significant week-on-week rise include Rossendale, where 35 people got infected in the last week. 

The Lancashire borough, home to 70,000 people, went from a case rate of 12.6 per 100,000 to 49 in seven days. 

In Greater Manchester, where swathes have been subject to tougher lockdowns - Trafford has seen a jump in cases. 

Trafford's infection rate rose from 19.4 to 35.4 cases per 100,000, with 84 new cases in the past seven days.

Meanwhile, Leeds in West Yorkshire has also seen a steep rise - up from 18.9 to 31.4 cases per 100,000, with 249 new infections.

It means hundreds of thousands of people in both areas will remain banned from mixing with people from other households, while businesses that were due to open - such as casinos - will need to remain closed.

Several areas in the North West will still come out of lockdown. They are Stockport, Burnley, Hyndburn and parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees.

Lockdowns are being lifted in some parts of the North West - but will now be kept in place in Bolton and Trafford

Earlier, Greater Manchester Mayor Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people in Bolton and Trafford should 'continue to follow the guidance' not to have social gatherings in their home.

'We find ourselves at a completely unsustainable position this morning - that's the politest way I can put it,' he said.

'Overnight we've had restrictions released in two boroughs where we've got a rising number of cases - in one case in the red zone.

'And neighbouring boroughs are still under restrictions but with much lower numbers of cases.

'These restrictions were always hard to explain to the public but they are completely illogical now.'

His comments echo those of Trafford Council leader Andrew Western, who blasted the 'chaotic' way local lockdowns had been handled and accused ministers of making a 'purely political calculation' to lift the restrictions even as cases rose.

It came after his counterpart in Bolton, the Tory councillor David Greenhalgh, insisted an 'unforeseeable' rise in infections meant it was necessary to keep the lockdown in place.

While the ban on mixing households has been lifted in many areas, they remain in others including Oldham, Pendle and Leicester.

Businesses opened elsewhere on August 15, such as casinos, bowling alleys and indoor concert venues, will also be allowed to reopen.

BOLTON'S INFECTION RATE: 18.2 per 100,000 people in week ending July 31; 31.2 per 100,000 people in week ending August 7; 25.6 per 100,000 people in week ending August 14; 18.4 per 100,000 people in week ending August 21; 44.9 per 100,000 people in week ending August 28; 56.4 per 100,000 people on September 1

Meanwhile, a rise in cases in Scotland has seen new lockdowns introduced in Glasgow as well as in East Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire.

Restrictions have been in place across much of the North West since July 15.

The request to maintain restrictions in Bolton was made following an emergency meeting between officials as the rate of new Covid-19 cases in Bolton surged over the weekend from 44.9 per 100,000 on Friday, to 56.4 per 100,000 yesterday.

Analysis showed that new cases in Bolton were spread across the borough and not limited to a single area, community, or place of work, said the council.

Infections between different households appear to be the main cause of the spike with people aged 18-49 representing the overwhelming majority of new cases, it added.

The government also faced calls from fellow Tories to keep restrictions in place in Trafford and Bolton before deciding to do so.

Conservative leader of Bolton Council, Councillor David Greenhalgh, said: 'It is with a heavy heart that the cabinet and officer team have come to this decision and this will be incredibly disappointing for both residents and business owners.

'We urged the Government to lift Bolton out of the additional restrictions at a time when infection rates were low.

'This was the right decision at the time.

'However, there has been a sudden and unforeseeable rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Bolton.

'We have always been led by the data, which means we have no choice but to act quickly to keep everyone safe.'

Below is Tuesday’s update of the rolling seven-day rate of new cases of Covid-19 for every local authority area in England.

The figures, for the seven days to August 29, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (known as pillar one tests) and in the wider community (pillar two).



The list has been calculated by the PA news agency and is based on Public Health England data published on September 1 on the Government’s coronavirus online dashboard.

From left to right, it reads: name of local authority; rate of new cases in the seven days to August 29; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to August 29; rate of new cases in the seven days to August 22; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to August 22.
