A Donald Trump supporter who allegedly struck a 13-year-old girl with a flagpole during a rally has been arrested.

Norbert Logsdon, 67, has been charged with child abuse after the attack on Wednesday, in Orange Park, Florida.

The violent scenes were captured on video by the girl's mother Crystal Ledoux who was driving past the rally.

She said: 'My daughter and I were on our way to grab a bite to eat and passed a rally of Trump supporters on the corner of Blanding Blvd and Loch Rane. 

'There was a man shouting and flipping passing cars by, so we reciprocated. Then the man charged at my daughter and I with his flagpole striking my daughter in the face and chest. 

'We couldn't believe the look of anger and rage as he attacked my daughter. 

'We felt trapped because I couldn't move forward with a car already in front of me. My daughter is still shook up over what happened.'

Logsdon, who has been released on bail, is seen in the video rushing towards the car after Ledoux swore at him.

He then shoves the pole, which had a flag attached bearing the phrase 'Trump 2020 no more bulls***', through the car window. 

It reportedly struck the young teenager in the face and chest and a voice can be heard saying 'he just hit me' in the video. 

Ledoux noted his license plate and alerted police who tracked down the Trump supporter and arrested him.

She says she has now learned her lesson and will not be driving near political rallies in the future.

She told KBMT: 'I'm not going anywhere near protesters to be honest with you because it scared us so bad someone reacted like that. 

'I did see on social media that people are taking this to extremes — as far as the Trump and the Bidens' supporters because that isn't the only incident where I've heard of injuries. 

'It's crazy the way the election is turning this year to be honest with you.'
