Tory rebels have won a vote on the 'rule of six' after 40 MPs wrote to Boris Johnson as PM signals climbdown in row over imposing Covid restrictions without Parliament's consent.

The backbenchers yesterday urged Mr Johnson to be 'smart' and give into their demands for a vote on new lockdown rules as he was told 'controlling the lives of 65million people by fiat is not sustainable'.

The vote is scheduled for October 6 and if it fails to pass Parliament the rule will be abolished.

Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, had tabled an amendment which would require a vote to be held on any new restrictions 'as soon as reasonably practicable'.

Sir Graham has the public backing of at least 40 of his fellow Tory MPs with the rebels hoping the amendment will be put to a vote next Wednesday.

However, they are urging the Government to back down before that point and to accept that MPs should be given a say on whether new rules should be imposed.

Boris Johnson is under mounting pressure from Tory MPs to grant Parliament a vote on any new lockdown measures

Mischievous Tory MPs are said to have nicknamed Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance 'Witless and Unbalanced' after they suggested the UK could face 50,000 daily coronavirus cases by mid-October

It comes amid growing Tory anger at Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance after the Government's two top scientists set out a doomsday scenario at the start of the week of the UK facing 50,000 new daily cases of coronavirus by mid-October unless drastic action was taken.

National debt hit another record high at the end of August as it continued to climb above £2 trillion as Tory MPs demanded the Government set out how the UK will pay for the coronavirus crisis after Rishi Sunak's latest business bailout. 

The Chancellor yesterday unveiled his Winter Economy Plan which included a wage subsidy Jobs Support Scheme to replace furlough as well as further VAT cuts for the hospitality and retail sectors and the extension of emergency loan schemes. 

The Office for National Statistics yesterday revealed public sector debt continues to rise above £2 trillion

Economists estimated the giveaway could cost £5 billion, potentially taking the total cost of the Government's Covid-19 support to approximately £200 billion.

Mr Sunak hinted that tax rises will eventually be required to get the public finances back on an even keel as he said he will have to make 'difficult decisions' in the future. 

But Conservative backbenchers want ministers to urgently set out their plan for paying the money back as they warned the Government it cannot 'keep kicking it into the long grass'.  

The scale of the Government's coronavirus spending was illustrated in stark terms this morning after the Office for National Statistics said the UK's national debt had hit a record £2.024 trillion at the end of August. 

That figure is almost £250 billion more than it was at the same time last year as borrowing hit 101.9 per cent of gross domestic product after £36 billion was borrowed by the public sector in August alone.  

 

The Telegraph reported some Tory MPs have nicknamed the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser 'Witless and Unbalanced', accusing them of 'scaremongering'. 

Meanwhile, ministers have been forced to deny claims of a rift between Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak after the Chancellor said yesterday it was time to 'live without fear' in comments which appeared to contradict the PM's new coronavirus crackdown.   

There is increasing concern among Tory MPs about the way in which the Government is handling the coronavirus crisis. 

Sir Graham has previously accused Mr Johnson of 'ruling by decree' by imposing restrictions on daily life without asking Parliament for permission.

His amendment is designed to grant MPs a vote on any new measures and with more than 40 Tories publicly backing the move and more expected to break ranks in the coming days the Government could be in danger of having its working majority of 85 overturned. 

The rebels want the plans to be voted on next Wednesday when the Government asks Parliament to renew its coronavirus powers for another six months.     

However, there are major questions over whether Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle will select the amendment amid claims it would not be legally binding on ministers.

Pressure is mounting on the Government to give in on the issue before a potentially damaging vote could be held. 

Signatories to Sir Graham's plans include Tory former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and former Brexit secretary David Davis. Opposition MPs have also signalled their support for the move. 

Mr Davis told The Telegraph: 'The smart sense is for the Government to give Brady and all of us what we are after. 

'It is a very unwise Conservative government that lets rebellion led by any chairman of the 1922 Committee go the distance.'

Sir Graham said he hoped the level of support for his plans will persuade Sir Lindsay to allow a vote on the amendment to take place.        

Senior Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, yesterday urged the Government to 'enter this conversation' on the plans in order to avoid a rebellion. 

He told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: 'You can give various blanket permissions in emergency ways but that doesn't mean you don't have to come and ask for permission as soon as is practical.

'The Government needs to enter this conversation and let's see where this conversation goes because what we've seen in the last six months, when we voted in the Coronavirus Act about six months ago, nobody expected it to last this long.

'It's quite clear that there's at least another six months of it as the Government has announced and it may indeed be longer than that depending on whether a vaccine comes or not, so the idea that we can have a permanent state where the Government is making emergency decisions for people and effectively controlling the lives of 65 million people by fiat is not sustainable.'



Senior Tory Tom Tugendhat said 'making emergency decisions for people and effectively controlling the lives of 65 million people by fiat is not sustainable' 

A Number 10 spokesman said: 'We understand MPs and their constituents will be concerned about coronavirus, that is why we continue to work closely with MPs to ensure they are able to hold the Government to account.' 

The row between Tory MPs and Number 10 came as ministers were forced to deny claims of a rift between Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson. 

Some interpreted Mr Sunak's statement yesterday that the nation must learn to 'live without fear' as contradicting the Prime Minister's move to impose new restrictions to slow the spread of Covid-19.

The Chancellor's remark that 'our lives can no longer be put on hold' as he detailed his latest emergency jobs package was also welcomed by Tory backbenchers uneasy over fresh restrictions.

But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are working extremely closely together and I think you can see that in the dovetailing of measures.'

He said there is a need to work 'in tandem between both the health measures announced by the Prime Minister and those of the Chancellor'.
