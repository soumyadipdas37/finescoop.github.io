Kristen Bell is 'beyond proud' of her husband Dax Shepard after he opened up about his recent relapse. 

The Parenthood star has been battling an addiction to prescription medication for over a decade, and recently admitted he had relapsed in his 16-year sobriety journey after he began taking Vicodin following a recent motorcycle accident. 

And although he initially kept his relapse a 'secret' from Kristen an Us Weekly source said she was 'nothing but supportive' of him when he finally confessed.

Dax and Kristen have been married since 2013 and are the proud parents of two daughters - Lincoln, seven, and Delta, five. 

The Us Weekly insider stated: 'Dax chose to keep this a secret from Kristen because he felt so ashamed at the time and didn’t want to hurt her.'

Said the source: 'They have such a strong marriage and have always been there for each other through thick and through thin.'

The insider revealed: 'Eventually, he couldn’t hide it from her any longer and he had to come clean. She was nothing but supportive and there’s no blame or anger on her side - just love, care and determination to get through this together.'

This source continued: 'Her heart aches for Dax after what he went through with his dad, and she’s beyond proud of him for turning his life around whilst openly addressing his demons head-on.'

Dax' father died of small cell carcinoma aged 62 in 2012 and his stepfather, with whom he was close, succumbed to prostate cancer in 2018. 

He confirmed he had suffered a relapse last week, and recently thanked his fans for their kind messages following his confession. 

Dax said: 'Just quickly, I want to say thanks to all the people that have been so unbelievably lovely to us in response to "Day 7." '

The star shared: 'My fears were the opposite of what the result was, yeah. But yeah, struggling with some fraudulent feelings of receiving love based on a f***-up. But, at any rate, I am really, really grateful, and there's so many beautiful, nice people.'

When the CHiPS star opened up about his relapse, he also spoke about previous instances in which he had fallen off the wagon.

Eight years into his sobriety while his father was dying, the pair of them took prescription drugs together.

At that point Dax had recently suffered a motorcycle accident and so was permitted to take Vicodin but was meant to do so in a strictly controlled fashion whereby Kristen would 'dole out the prescription.'

'Hard and wonderful work of sobriety': On September 1 this year he got a card from one of his daughters for his '15th sobriety birthday'

He said of his father: 'You know, we had so little in common and so much f***ing friction. But the number one thing we had in common was we were both f***ing addicts and we had never used anything together.'

The Without A Paddle heartthrob recalled on occasion when 'we sat there stoned and looked at the lake. And in that moment, I felt elation and I was just happy ... I probably took twice [as much] of what my other prescription was.'

Eventually his prescription drug use reached the point where he decided to seek help and go on the wagon.

During his confession last week, Dax also revealed he was starting his sobriety over again, and was seven days clean as of September 21.
