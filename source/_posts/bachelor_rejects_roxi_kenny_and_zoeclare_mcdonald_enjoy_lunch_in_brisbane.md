Bachelor contestants Roxi Kenny and Zoe-Clare McDonald appeared to be in deep conversation with one another as they visited a Queensland restaurant on Friday.

Roxi, 29 and Zoe-Clare, 23 looked tense as they enjoyed lunch at The Calile Hotel in Brisbane.

Roxi flaunted her figure in a white crop top and stylish grey flare pants as she arrived to the establishment.

Is everything okay? Bachelor rejects Roxi Kenny and Zoe-Clare McDonald appeared to have an intense conversation over lunch in Brisbane on Friday

She completed her ensemble with a pair of nude strappy sandals and held a brown bag.

The Bachelor's 'oppressed ranga' Zoe-Clare showed off her slim figure and pins in a black mini dress.

She styled her red locks in curls and accessorised her ensemble with a pair of black strappy heels. 

Their outing comes after Roxi revealed the real reason she stormed off The Bachelor after her feud with co-star Juliette Hererra.

Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O show on Friday, the blonde beauty said: 'It all just became a bit too much and I was becoming a person I wasn't happy with.'

'It was best for me to go home and be away from the toxic environment I was in,' she added.

She went on to say she doesn't regret leaving the show as it was the 'best decision at the time'.

On Thursday night, Roxi dramatically exited the show after a fiery stoush with co-star Juliette Herrera.

The 29-year-old reached boiling point after the two women got into an argument at the cocktail party.

After weeks of feuding with Juliette, Roxi couldn't take anymore of it and decided to leave.
