The Kyle and Jackie O show hammered former champions Jonesy and Amanda, who ranked in second place.

Sandilands and Henderson won with an audience share of 10.2 per cent, placing them well ahead of their WSFM rivals, who had a 8.6 per cent share. 

Nova 96.9’s Fitzy & Wippa - also known as Ryan Fitzgerald and Michael Wipfli - took third place with a 6.5 per cent share, down from 7.7 per cent from the last survey in April.

Meanwhile, Moonman in the Morning with Lawrence Mooney on Triple M was down from 6.0 per cent to 4.9 per cent.

Celebrating their win on Tuesday, Kyle and Jackie O said: 'Today’s the first radio ratings since the pandemic began and we’re thrilled to have remained number 1 FM.

'Thank you to our listeners for choosing us to be your light amongst the shade. There’s only a few months until the year is over, let’s get through it together!' 

The pair currently have more listeners than any other FM Breakfast show in Australia. 

The results were certainly highly-anticipated, as GFK were forced to pause surveys due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Aside from the pandemic, surveys usually occur eight times a year, so time will tell if the show can secure another full year as the most-popular breakfast team in Sydney.

Despite Kyle and Jackie O's strong performance as a market leader, the long-reigning FM breakfast champions lost their ratings crown for the first time in three years in August 2018 to WSFM breakfast with Brendan ‘Jonesy’ Jones and Amanda Keller.

Kyle and Jackie have worked with each other for two decades, and have interviewed some of the biggest celebrities on the planet.
