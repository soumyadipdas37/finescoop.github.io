She's been announced as one of the 12 contestants set to compete in this year's series of Strictly Come Dancing.

And Maisie Smith looked sensational as she showed off her toned figure in a pair of skin-tight hot pants in three new Instagram snaps shared on Sunday.

The actress and TikTok sensation, 19, exuded confidence as she posed up a storm in the tiny bottoms and a silver tiara during a recent day golfing. 

Glowing: Maisie Smith looked sensational as she showed off her toned figure in a pair of skin-tight hot pants and a tiara in two new Instagram snaps shared on Sunday

Maisie cut a colourful figure in her snaps as she also donned a bright purple long-sleeved t-shirt with Spider-Man on the front.

The beauty wore her stunning auburn tresses down and let her curls cascade over her shoulders as she posed with a golf club resting on one shoulder.

She accessorised her ensemble with a silver tiara and accentuated her pretty features with a slick of pink lipstick.

Maisie also shared snaps from her golfing trip last Wednesday which revealed she completed her sporty look with some white trainers.

Poser: The actress put on a colourful display in yellow shorts and a long-sleeved purple t-shirt

Work it: Maisie posed with a golf club over one shoulder as she took a break from showing off her sporting skills for the quick photoshoot

It comes after Maisie was announced as joining the Strictly Come Dancing line-up, alongside Jamie Laing, Clara Amfo and Bill Bailey.

Maisie's signing to Strictly comes despite her being under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette'. 

The actress was at the centre of controversy over the summer, when she was spotted smoking at the wheel of her car.   

A source told The Sun: 'It is unthinkable that Strictly would sign her after the few weeks she has had. The show is the pinnacle of the BBC and gives rising stars and established ones a huge step to more fame. 

New signing: Maisie was recently announced as one of the 12 contestants taking part in the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing

'So it’s very weird to give someone whose future was very unclear just weeks ago such an opportunity. Perhaps they see it as a way of nailing down a rising star rather than her leaving and taking with her a young audience.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Maisie and Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.

Maisie was also revealed as being investigated by BBC bosses after she was spotted smoking the cigarette in question.

The Sun reported that bosses were 'angry' and 'extremely disappointed' after Maisie was caught with the  hand-rolled cigarette, after pulling over on an empty road in Essex on July 19. 

Golfer: Maisie also shared snaps from her golfing outing on Wednesday 

While on Sunday night a new report alleged that a former crew member had tested positive for coronavirus, just days before recording on the new series of the BBC show is set to begin.

As a result 'everyone was told to leave,' according to a source, who also claimed that the set was given a powerful deep clean as show bosses await the results of a third medical test on the lighting expert.  

According to The Sun, the lighting expert spent a week working on the dance contest's set.

Not impressed: Maisie, who plays Tiffany Butcher in EastEnders, has been signed to Strictly  despite her being under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette'

Following his positive test result, at least five staff who were in close contact with him were sent home and told to self-isolate and await tests of their own, according to the report. 

A source told MailOnline: 'The crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.

'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.'
