A teenager who allegedly left his housemate clinging to life after a frenzied knife attack told police 'I hope the c**t dies', a court has heard. 

Codey Eig, 19, of the Brisbane suburb of Darra, allegedly stabbed his housemate in the stomach and neck during an altercation in a rental home on Scotts Road at about 4.30pm on Sunday.

The 18-year-old alleged victim was taken to Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital in a critical condition, police said on Monday.

On Monday afternoon his condition was listed as critical but stable.

 Eig appeared to hobble in Richlands Magistrates Court on Monday, where the court heard he had stabbed his housemate so savagely that the knife broke.

The court heard allegations that Eig told police 'I hope the c**t dies'.

He also allegedly said: 'I shanked the s**t out of him', the court heard.  

Eig had lived in the share house with his 15-year-old girlfriend, the alleged victim and three other girls for about four months, according to a neighbour. 

Defence lawyer Rhys Foster told the court Eig had acted in self defence and asked for bail with the teen to wear an ankle bracelet.

Police set up a crime scene late on Sunday afternoon at the house on the corner of Scotts Road and Lee Road, Darra, where the alleged stabbing occurred

Mr Foster said the teen had been asleep with his girlfriend, aged 15, when he opened his bedroom door and was confronted by several people.

He told the court that Eig had 'resisted instinctually' after being backed into a corner when the victim 'came at him' with a knife, and then ran across the road to ask a neighbour to call for an ambulance.  

Magistrate Stuart Shearer denied the teen bail, saying Eig was a flight risk and had a recent criminal record.

'He is not getting bail. You don't stab someone in the abdomen and the neck so hard you break off the knife handle inside them if you're acting in self defence,' Magistrate Shearer said, as quoted in the Courier Mail.

'Shanking the s**t out of someone and hoping they die – even if everything else he said is true — is not proportionate to the threat.'

Magistrate Shearer said Eig was an unacceptable risk of reoffending and remanded him in custody.

Eig, who was charged with acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm, is to reappear in Richlands Magistrates Court on November 9.
