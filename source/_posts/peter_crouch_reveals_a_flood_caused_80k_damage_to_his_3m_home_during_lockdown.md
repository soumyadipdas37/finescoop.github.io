Peter Crouch revealed his £3 million home was hit by a flood during lockdown, causing around £80k worth of damage to his son Johnny's bedroom.

The professional footballer, 39, made an appearance on Rob Beckett and Josh Widdcombe's Parenting Lockdown Hell podcast on Tuesday, where he also admitted wife Abbey Clancy doesn't trust him alone with all four of their children. 

Of the damage the flood did to their home, Peter explained: 'We had a flood during lockdown and it took out one of the bedrooms. It’s an official flood. We had the flood and one of the bedrooms is out of action.

'We had to sort of jiggle things around so hopefully when the bedroom is back in action we’ll get the boys back in there together.'

Peter, who has a custom made bed that is 8 ft by 8 ft, joked that because of the flood he has his two-year-old Johnny sleeping with him and Abbey, which means that he often ends up with his 'face on the side table.'

Jack, 15 months, sleeps in a cot in their room, but Johnny is staying with them until the damage made by the flood has been fixed.

Stressful: Of the damage the flood did to their home, Peter explained: 'We had a flood during lockdown and it took out one of the bedrooms'

Of his youngest not staying in the bed with them, Peter said: 'With the one-year-old I said look this is ridiculous and we have to be on it with this one, but amazingly he's as good as gold, we put him in at seven and we go back in and he doesn't make a peep.'

However it's not as peaceful with Johnny as Peter joked, 'he's two and he loves lying sideways so imagine you wake up with your face on the side table.' 

Going on to relay the amusing reason as to why his wife doesn't 'trust [him] fully' with their little ones, he said he's only been along with them 'an hour at a time, no weekends just yet.'

Peter said of his dad duties: 'We've got some help, her mum is very good and we've got some family who can help us because I don't think abs would trust me fully on my own with all four.'

Abbey could be heard speaking in the background, as he added: 'She's looking at me now, oh yea did you hear that? She's shouted over the top of me "what about that time you lost him at the farm?" 

He said of the incident with son Jack: 'We're all in the farm and we're with the toddlers, and you can't get out of this little bit we're in unless an adult presses the button, which is high enough for an adult to press. 

Accident: Peter also detailed how he once lost son Jack (pictured) at a farm after teenagers opened the door to the play pen and his little one wandered off to the sheep nearby

'Anyway a teenager, I thought he was fine playing where he is and teenagers obviously pressed the button and he's gone out, now he's out by the sheep now I'm sort of in the play bit.

'It's all covered and she's gone "where's Jack?" and I've gone, "he's just... out by the sheep by the looks of it!" So there was a bit of a panic, but all good he didn't go too far.'

As well as sons Johnny and Jack, Abbey and Peter share daughters Sophia, nine, and Liberty, five.
