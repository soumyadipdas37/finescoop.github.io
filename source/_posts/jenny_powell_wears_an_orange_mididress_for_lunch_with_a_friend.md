Jenny is engaged to a man, publicly known only as Martin; she divorced ex-husband Toby Baxendale in 2009 after a three-year marriage. They share daughters Constance, 19, and Pollyanna, 11.

Last year, Jenny spoke with Kate Thornton, during an appearance on the White Wine Question Time podcast, about meeting Martin by chance in 2016.

She recalled: 'I was in Pret a Manger at Euston waiting to get the train back up to Manchester and this Adonis walks in, I thought, "Bloody hell, he’s alright".

'And I just put my head down because I was ogling him, and this shadow loomed over me and it was him asking if he could sit down.'

She added: 'He was chatting away and he said, "Do you want my number?" And I said "What for?" I mean, what girl says that to a fit bloke?

'He went, "Well, you obviously haven’t been dating very much because now, in this day and age, I don’t put any pressure on you; I’ll give you the option. I will give you the number, then you can walk away and then you can think about it." 

'So I grabbed the number off him. I texted him saying: "I'm a mature woman, I don’t play games. My name’s Jenny. This is me. This is my number. Whatever." He rang that night, and asked if he could take me out to dinner.'

After rising to fame on '80s TV show No Limits, Jenny appeared on Wheel Of Fortune alongside both Nicky Campbell and John Leslie from 1995 until 2001.
