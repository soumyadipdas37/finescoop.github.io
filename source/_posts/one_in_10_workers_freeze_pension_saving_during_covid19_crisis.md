Nearly a quarter of workers have stopped paying into their pension or are actively considering it as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc with people's finances, new research reveals.

Pausing contributions can blow a hole in future retirement pots, with a 30-year-old earning £30,000 standing to lose more than £45,000 by opting out of pension auto enrolment for three years.

The most common reason given for taking a break from pension saving was needing money for essential spending, but many people cited redundancy or being furloughed, according to the study by Canada Life.

Pension experts urge people to keep paying into pensions if they can afford it, to avoid harming their chances of a decent retirement.

You can keep paying in to some types of pensions even if you have left your employer, and payments into pots based on 80% of salary are protected should you be furloughed.

One in 10 workers have paused pension contributions during the coronavirus lockdown and a further 13 per cent are considering doing so, according to a survey of 2,000 people carried out in late August.

Canada Life looks at the impact of three-year pension breaks on workers at age 30, 40 and 50 at different income levels, and how much extra they would need to save to make up the shortfall in the table below.

People who are auto-enrolled into pensions contribute at least 4 per cent of qualifying earnings - which means a band between £6,240 and £50,000 in the 2020/21 tax year - while employers put in 3 per cent and the Government adds another 1 per cent in tax relief.

Those who opt out of auto-enrolment will find their employer re-enrols them again once every three years, but it does this on its own schedule, usually on a rolling basis starting from when it first introduced auto enrolment, not timed on when a worker dropped out.

Find out the three important rules to remember, and the options for what to do about different types of pension here. 

Once re-enrolled, a worker has to actively opt out again if that is what they wish. 

If you are made redundant and get a new job, you will be auto enrolled into your new employer's pension scheme if you are 22 or over and earning £10,000-plus.

'With Covid-19 hitting personal finances harder than ever it is not too surprising that many have started to view their pension contributions as discretionary,' says Andrew Tully, technical director at Canada Life.

'While a three-year pension holiday may seem like a minor break in the context of a career spanning decades, our analysis shows that the long-term impact of that decision could be significant.

'Any choices made now could have real significance to the quality of life in retirement so it is vital that the impact of this is understood properly, from the outset.

'It is worrying to see that 13 per cent of respondents were actively considering a pension holiday. However, there are some ways to mitigate the potential impact.

'Our analysis shows that losses can be recovered at each stage of a working life as long as there is a plan in place to resume contributions as soon as practicable.

'Savers will also need to understand that contributions will need to be higher than they were before and in some cases by as much as a fifth for those closer to retirement.'

Separate recent research has found middle-aged savers could see their pensions take a particularly bad hit as two recessions and a stingier pension system undermine their ability to provide for old age. 

The financial crash and the coronavirus crisis will disrupt the earnings of many people currently aged 40-55, who will also miss out on generous final salary pensions and the full benefits of auto-enrolment.

A high redundancy rate among people in this age group and declining access to financial advice are other factors affecting their chances of a decent retirement.

If you are worried about your pension and whether you will have enough, read a full 10-step guide to sorting it out here. 

To get started, investigate your existing pensions. Broadly speaking, you need to ask schemes the following:

- The current fund value

- The current transfer value - because there might be a penalty to move

- Whether the pension is in a final salary or defined contribution scheme

- If there are any guarantees - for instance, a guaranteed annuity rate - and if you would lose them if you moved the fund

- The pension projection at retirement age.

You can use a pension calculator to see if you have enough - find This is Money's here.

 You should add the forecast figures to what you anticipate getting in state pension, which is currently around £9,100 a year if you have a full National Insurance record.
