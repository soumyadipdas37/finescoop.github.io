It was all about the hometown visits on Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor Australia. 

And despite Locky Gilbert meeting the family, it seems that fans just couldn't get enough of the stunning homes shown during the visits. 

Some viewers flocked to Twitter saying that they were convinced the contestants were staying in lavish Airbnbs for the show. 

'There's no way they live in such nice houses': Bachelor fans are convinced the finalists stayed in lavish Airbnbs for hometown visits during the show on Wednesday, after being offered a glimpse inside the stunning pads. Finalist Bella Varelis is pictured

'No way these people live in such nice houses,' one fan tweeted.

Another added: 'So all these houses are Airbnb then. No one is actually shooting home visits at their homes.'

But host Osher Gunsberg appeared to hint that the sprawling pad Bella Varelis stayed in was her family's home.

Cheeky: 'Izzy's mum asking for sperm > Bella's mum offering keys to the beach house,' Osher tweeted

'Izzy's mum asking for sperm > Bella's mum offering keys to the beach house,' he tweeted. 

During Bella's hometown visit, Locky met her overprotective father and her mother and step father. 

As she welcomed them into the pad, her mother gushed over the place, implying it was a rental arranged by Channel 10.

'Welcome to my weekend home,' Bella said as she greeted her family. 

Bella's mother added: 'It's beautiful and stunning.' 

While Locky couldn't meet Irena Srbinovska's family due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, he met Bella, Izzy Sharman-Firth and Bec Cvilikas' clan. 

Bella, Izzy and Bec all stayed in beautiful mansions for the visits, all being double-storey, modern and featuring gorgeous lap pools.

For the visits, the family members all arrived at the pads before being greeted by the Locky and the respective finalists, which could suggest the homes were rented.

Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, are now Locky's top two finalists. 

In a dramatic teaser for Thursday's finale, Locky breaks down in tears as he's forced to make the heartbreaking decision to let one go and pick his winner.

The decision is even more difficult given that the teaser shows him confidently telling both beauties that he's falling in love with them on their final dates together. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment, in relation to this story. 

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
