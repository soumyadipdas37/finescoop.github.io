A rotting Grade II-listed country home has gone on the market for £400,000 but the new owner will have to spend a lot more than that to restore it.

Blackborough House which extends to over 15,500 square feet, is located in the idyllic location within the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the small hamlet of Blackborough, Devon.  

The once extravagant property was built in 1838 for George Francis Wyndham, the 4th Earl of Egremont and was originally designed as an Italianate palace.
