Mandy Moore has risen to the top: first as a teenage pop singer and then as a bonafide star of television and film.

But on Wednesday, with the COVID-19 pandemic still having a major impact on the entertainment industry, the This Is Us star spend part of her day out on an errand run in Los Angeles. 

Moore was spotted moments after she parked her car on the street and stepped out out holding several garments she had on hangers that appeared to include a dress or two.

The New Hampshire native was all about style and comfort in the fashion department decked out in a black, white and grey flowy dress that came down just past her knees.

She also wore a pair of matching slips, had a bold red purse over her left shoulder and styled her dark brown tresses long with a part in the middle. 

Making her look nearly unrecognizable, Moore also donned dark sunglasses and a white protective mask over her nose and mouth in accordance to health and safety protocols amid the coronavirus crisis.

By early afternoon on Wednesday, Moore was among the many people to take to social media to express their outrage over a Kentucky grand jury's decision not to directly charge any of the three Louisville police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March.

Of the three, only Officer Brett Hankison, who was fired in June, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree for firing several shots outside Taylor's apartment that went into a neighboring unit.

'Today’s news is devastating and infuriating and indicative of a miserably broken system,' Moore wrote in an Instagram post that include a picture of the late 26-year-old emergency medial technician.

'Breonna Taylor’s life had value. She and her family deserve justice. Black women matter. Black Lives matter.'

Outrage! Moore was among the many people to take to social media to express their outrage over a Kentucky grand jury's decision not to directly charge any of the three Louisville police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March; one former officer was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree

Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep just before 1 a.m. on March 13 when the three plainclothes officers with the Louisville Metro  Police Department broke down the door to her apartment while executing a warrant in a narcotics investigation.

Walker allegedly discharged his firearm first, injuring a law enforcement officer. His lawyer has maintained that his client thought someone was breaking into the residence illegally, and that he acted only in self-defense.

Oprah Winfrey, Viola Davis, Kerry Washington, LeBron James, Yara Shahidi, Lizzo, director Ava DuVernay, Common, Padma Lakshmi, Jemele Hill, Jojo, Joshua Jackson and Yvette Nicole Brown were among the many celebrities to express their dismay over the decision not to charge the officers with Taylor's death.
