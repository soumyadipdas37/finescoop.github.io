Macklemore definitely caught a number of his nearly five million Instagram followers off guard with his new look. 

The 37-year-old rapper unveiled his new facial hair and voluminous curls in his shirtless selfie on Sunday. 

'Oh you didn't think I was gonna hit the glow up during Covid? Tag someone that didn't know I had natural curls and enter in a chance to win my secret recipe for the perfect dangles,' the Thrift Shop hitmaker captioned the post.

Macklemore's curly locks were a striking contrast to his signature long-on-top, shaved-on-sides haircut.

As he smiled at the camera, the three-time Grammy winner donned two gold necklaces and put a few of his known 18 tattoos on full display. 

On the left side of the performer's chest, his scorpion tat could be seen, in addition to an inked face of a woman wearing a hat and a scarf, just inches to the right. 

The picture caused quite a stir among his fans in the comment section, as many remarked that he was unrecognizable or resembled Tiger King's Joe Exotic.
