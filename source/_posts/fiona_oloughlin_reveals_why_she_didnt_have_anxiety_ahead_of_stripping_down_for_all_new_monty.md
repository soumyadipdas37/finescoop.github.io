She's set to strip off on Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals later this month. 

And now comedian Fiona O'Loughlin has revealed what it really feels like to be baring all for breast cancer.

Speaking to The Advertiser, the 57-year-old comedian admitted she didn't hesitate when she was asked to be involved. 

Baring all! Australian comedian Fiona O'Loughlin, 57, (pictured) has revealed why she didn't have anxiety ahead of stripping down for All New Monty: Guys and Gals

'I'd stripped on stage before in one of my shows, On a Wing and a Prayer,' Fiona said.

'I thought to myself everybody (in The All New Monty: Guys & Gals) is doing it, so I didn't have much anxiety about it… and the costumes were just amazing.'

Fiona told the publication that the show's live audience was 'so pumped' for her and her co-stars, including Home and Away's Sam Frost, to take to the stage.

'I thought to myself everybody [on the show] is doing it, so I didn't have much anxiety about it … and the costumes were just amazing,' she told The Advertiser this week

'It was an exciting, joyful night,' she added. 

The funnywoman was crowned Queen of the jungle back in 2018, after winning the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!

Fiona will do the burlesque show alongside the likes of actress Sam Frost, entertainer Patti Newton, Russell Crowe's ex wife Danielle Spencer and Olympian Leisel Jones.
