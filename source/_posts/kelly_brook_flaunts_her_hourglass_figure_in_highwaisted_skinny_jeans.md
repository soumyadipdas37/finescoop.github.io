She rarely puts a foot wrong when it comes to everyday style choices. 

And Kelly Brook showcased her model credentials as she stepped out in London on Tuesday for her Heart Drive show at London's Global Studios. 

The 40-year-old presenter looked effortlessly chic as she flaunted her hourglass figure in high-waisted skinny jeans ahead of her radio show with Jason King.

Kelly paired her laid-back look with a sheer blue chiffon blouse tucked into her jeans and added height to her ensemble with tan cowboy boots. 

Letting her long brunette tresses cascade down her back, Kelly framed her pretty features with oversized tortoiseshell shades. 

The star finished her look with a gold chain necklace and carried her work essentials in a black leather quilted bag on her shoulder.

Meanwhile radio presenter Johnny Vaughan, 54, was seen heading into Global as he carried a takeaway drink.

Kelly's stylish display comes as she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up' and declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March.  

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The media personality has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks. 

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'

'From my point of view, being home all the time is very different to my normal routine, which I've had to adapt to. I can't complain - I'm healthy and that's been number one during this period.' 

In a bid to stay active, the Piranha 3D actress has created designated areas in her home for Pilates and yoga, goes out for walks in the city, and enjoys frequent trampolining sessions.

Kelly's ex Danny Cipriani recently confirmed he is engaged to his new girlfriend, mental health campaigner Victoria Rose.

The 32-year-old rugby player, who dated the TV star from 2008 until 2010,  confirmed the news on Instagram earlier this month.  

Danny and Victoria had just gone public with their relationship in June, after bravely revealing he once tried to buy a gun to kill himself in an emotional video uploaded following the death of his ex, Love Island host Caroline Flack.
