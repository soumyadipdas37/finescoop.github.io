A pair of white sneakers were added to the ensemble, and the brunette wore her dark hair down around her shoulders.  

On Wednesday, NRL star Josh Reynolds' ex-girlfriend showed off her latest transformation after getting new hair extensions.

The model shared a photo to Instagram, after visiting Sake Hair Studio in Melbourne.

Arabella wore a full face of makeup for the picture, including foundation, rosy blush, and black eyeliner.

'Thank you Sake Hair Studio for the amazing weft extensions... they are safe for your natural hair and are applied without heat,' she wrote.

She explained: 'They last up to around 6-8 weeks... and they've given myself just that extra bit of thickness and length.'
