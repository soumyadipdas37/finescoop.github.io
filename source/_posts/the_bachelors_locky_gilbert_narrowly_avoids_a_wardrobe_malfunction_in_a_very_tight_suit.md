The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert narrowly avoided a wardrobe malfunction on Thursday night.

The 30-year-old suitor wore a very tight suit jacket and matching coloured pants as he welcomed the contestants back into the mansion. 

Fans flocked to Twitter, claiming Locky's outfit didn't fit him properly and it 'looked ridiculous'. 

'Give the man some room to move!' Fans insisted Locky Gilbert (pictured) 'looked ridiculous' as he narrowly avoided a wardrobe malfunction in a VERY tight suit on Thursday

'Who the hell is dressing Locky? Seriously give the man some room to move! That suit... argh,' one person wrote.

'Who put him in that teddy bear sized suit jacket? He looks ridiculous,' another one agreed.

'Come on. Could they not have found a suit that fits Locky?' another said. 'That's one very tight suit!' one person wrote.

Snug! 'Who put him in that teddy bear sized suit jacket? He looks ridiculous,' wrote one fan

Budget restraints? 'Come on. Could they not have found a suit that fits Locky?' another said 

'The person tailoring the men's pants on this show needs to let the hem out at least another 5cms,' another person agreed.

'The suit is shrinking by the minute,' one person commented.

'Locky's suit no longer fits. Lockdown has been hard for everyone,' another person joked.

Meanwhile, Roxi Kenny dramatically exited the show after a fiery stoush with co-star Juliette Herrera on Thursday.

The 29-year-old reached boiling point after the two women got into an argument at the cocktail party.

After weeks of feuding with Juliette, Roxi couldn't take anymore of it and decided to leave.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
