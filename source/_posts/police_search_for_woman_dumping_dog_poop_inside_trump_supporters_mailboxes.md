Police in Maine are trying to track down a woman who is dumping dog poop into the mailboxes of President Trump supporters. 

According to authorities, the offender has deliberately been targeting homes in the Hampden area that have Trump signs erected in their front yards. 

The woman is alleged to have carried out the caper on Sunday and Monday, with startled Republicans calling cops after discovering dog droppings alongside their mail. 

Hampden Police have now released a photo of the suspect out on her bicycle amid fears she may strike again.

The image shows that the apparent offender is a middle-aged white woman with shoulder-length brown hair. 

She was last seen dressed in a purple t-shirt, denim shorts and lavender colored Crocs. 

The woman also donned a black face mask while carrying out her criminal activities. 

Alyshia Canwell, a patrol officer with Hampden Public Safety, told WGME on Thursday that the woman has also been 'defacing Trump signs' that residents have put up ahead of the November election. 

Concerned locals took to Facebook to encourage cops to catch the offender. 

'I wonder if she will get federal charges for messing with mailboxes. Isn't it illegal on some level to mess with political signs too?' one asked.

Another wrote: 'What is wrong with people, can’t wait for 2021. I am so over all this cr*p, no pun intended.'

There are fears across Hampden (pictured) that the woman may soon strike again
