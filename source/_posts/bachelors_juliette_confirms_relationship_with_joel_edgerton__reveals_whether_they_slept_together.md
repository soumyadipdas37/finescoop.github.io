Earlier this month, a close friend of Bachelor star Juliette Herrera revealed to Daily Mail Australia that she had a secret relationship with actor Joel Edgerton. 

And now the 34-year-old reality star and stylist confirmed their past romance when talking to KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O on Thursday. 

During the chat, Juliette was also probed about whether they had sex during their brief time together, before Juliette revealed what the actor is really like.

'Forget those girls, tell me about when you were having sex with Joel Edgerton?' shock jock Kyle Sandilands asked, after Juliette talked about her Bachelor co-stars.

'I can't believe you just said that!' Juliette said, laughing and screaming. 

'Look, he was actually very respectful and patient and we never had sex,' she said.

'We were taking it very slow.'  

She added that she chose not to sleep with the Boy Erased star - or anyone - as she was 'seeking God.' 

'I think it's because I was seeking God for a long time and I didn't want to be hypocrite or live a party girl life, I was focusing on God,' Juliette said.  

It was recently revealed on The Bachelor that Juliette has been celibate for 12 years.  

The brunette beauty added on the Kyle and Jackie O Show that she 'doesn't know if she'll have sex again.'

'They need to be amazing, charismatic, kind,' she said about potential suitors, saying they need to wait for her to form a connection with them first.

Earlier this month, a close friend of the reality star revealed to Daily Mail Australia that the couple dated for four months from September 2011. 

'Juliette was working as a stylist for [Cosmopolitan magazine] at the time and he was about to start filming Gatsby, so they kept their relationship low-key,' the source revealed.

'They've kept in touch and been really cool about their break up, and Juliette has been respectful of his romance with Christine (Centenera).'

In fact, Juliette attended a screening of his 2018 film Boy Erased in Los Angeles.

Following their failed romance, Joel met and dated model Alexis 'Lexi' Blake in 2012 for two years after they met while holidaying in Bali. 

However, they decided to call it quits so Joel could pursue filmmaking.

Joel has since been dating Christine Centenera after they 'debuted their romance' at GQ Australia's Man of the Year awards in Sydney on November 14, 2018.

They first sparked romance rumours a month earlier, when they were pictured in an intimate embrace in Sydney.
