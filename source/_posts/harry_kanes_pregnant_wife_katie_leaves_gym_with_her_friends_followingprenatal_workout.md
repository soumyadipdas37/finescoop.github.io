Opting for comfort, the fitness instructor teamed her top with a pair of cropped running tights and monochrome trainers.

The mother-of-two ensured she injected a hint of glamour to her appearance as she carried her essentials in a £2,050 micro luggage handbag by Celine.

With her tresses pulled back into a bun, the blonde displayed her naturally radiant complexion as she went make-up free.

Harry and Katie are already parents to their two daughters Ivy Jane, three, and Vivienne Jane, two. 

In July, footballer Harry shared an intimate look at their virtual gender reveal where he kicked an inflatable football filled with blue smoke. 

The Spurs star, 27, captioned the video with: 'We are having a Boy,' followed by heart eyes emoji and a blue heart. Kate shared the same clip, adding a simple blue heart emoji.

In the clip, the couple Zoomed their nearest and dearest as they asked them to guess whether it was a girl or a boy.

Harry then went to a goal post, which had a huge inflatable ball hanging off it, and kicked a football at it which exploded and released blue air. The footballer met Kate while they were at school.

He proposed in July 2017 when the childhood sweethearts were away on holiday in Barbados. 

At the time, the England captain joked to his partner he would not cry on his wedding day and that he would only shed tears if England won a trophy. 

He said: 'I always wind my missus up that I'd cry if we won a trophy with England. And she said if you don't cry when I walk down the aisle then she won't go through with it!

'I'm not a crier, I'm not someone who cries a lot. My missus has probably never seen me cry. So we'll have to see what comes first.'
