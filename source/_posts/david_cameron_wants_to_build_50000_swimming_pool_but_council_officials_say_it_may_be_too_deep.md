Former Prime Minister David Cameron (seen in Cornwall recently) is trying to build a £50,000 swimming pool in the garden of his country home but his plans could be scuppered after council officials said it may be too deep

Former Prime Minister David Cameron is trying to build a £50,000 swimming pool in the garden of his country home but his plans could be scuppered after council officials said it may be too deep, MailOnline can reveal.

A planning application was submitted to West Oxfordshire District Council in early August for the pool at Mr Cameron’s £1.5 million home in the Cotswolds, which he shares with wife Samantha and their three children.

 Mr Cameron’s ambitions to take to the water in his own backyard have suffered a setback after council officials demanded further investigations be carried out on the environmental impact of the proposed pool.

At 14 metres long and four metres wide, the pool has a sloping floor, giving it a depth of 1.5 metres at its shallowest falling to 2 metres at its deepest. 

The plans propose eight underwater lights and stylish dark tiles around the pool, which will be dug in an extended part of the garden currently described as 'meadow grass'.

Local planning officials have asked the former premier for a detailed report on the pool’s impact on groundwater on his property and how it will be drained when it needs to be cleaned.

They have also demanded more details on how the pool will be heated and for ‘technical noise data’ for any pump or plant room that maybe used over fears it might cause a racket in the sleepy Cotswolds village of Dean.

David and Samantha Cameron bought their house in 2001 when he became MP for Witney.

Other famous residents who live in the area include footballer David Beckham, TV presenters Jeremy Clarkson and Amanda Holden, and Blur bassist Alex James.

The planning application refers to Mr Cameron as ‘Was Witney’s MP.’ It does not contain details of the cost but the average price for building a pool in the Cotswolds is in the region of £50,000 but can be more depending on the style.

Mr Cameron’s pool is being built by Blue Water Pools which is based in Oxfordshire and run by businessmen Michael Jackson and Barry Cavey.

The company refused to comment on details of the former premier’s pool.

Since leaving Number 10 in 2016, Mr Cameron, 53, has been on a health kick after piling on the pounds during his time in office. He spent several months on a no bread diet and has been working out to ensure the flab does not return.

With uncertainty continuing over travelling and social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Cameron is just one of a number of wealthy residents of the Cotswolds who have resorted to building their own pool in the drive to stay fit.

Swimming pool builders in the Cotswolds told MailOnline that they have never been busier.

A spokeswoman for Rio Pools said: ‘We’re fully booked up until next April. This is a bit of a boom time for the pool building industry.

In 2017, Mr Cameron installed a £25,000 shepherd’s hut in his garden so he could write his memoir, but it did not require any planning permission

‘The average cost of a pool is around £50,000 to £60,000 but it can be a lot more depending on its look and the type of water you want. Basically, if you’ve got the money, you can spend as much as you want on a pool.’

In 2017, Mr Cameron installed a £25,000 shepherd’s hut in his garden so he could write his memoir, but it did not require any planning permission.

He has also previously been given the go-ahead to raise the height of an existing stone boundary wall and block up an existing gate at his home.

Mr Cameron will be hoping for a similarly favourable outcome once the council digests the new reports it has asked for. It is likely to make a decision on his new pool at the end of this month.

So far, there have been been no objections from Mr Cameron’s immediate neighbours and  the former prime minister declined to comment.
