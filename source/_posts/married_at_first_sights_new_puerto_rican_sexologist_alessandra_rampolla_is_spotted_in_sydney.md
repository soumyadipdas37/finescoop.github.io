Puerto Rican sexologist Alessandra Rampolla will join Nine's upcoming season of Married At First Sight as a resident 'expert'.

And on Friday, the TV star was all smiles as she enjoyed a brisk walk around Sydney's beachside suburb of Bronte.

The 46-year-old appeared to be familiarizing herself with the local area that she will likely call home for the show's lengthy filming and production process.

MAFS often films from August until November, and then reconvenes for a reunion episode in January.

As part of Nine's Upfronts on Wednesday, the network announced that sexologist Alessandra would be joining Mel Schilling and John Aiken as Married At First Sight's newest relationship expert in 2021. 

Taking in the fresh air on a neighbourhood stroll, the blonde stunner dressed casually in activewear leggings and a grey T-shirt.

Walking with pace and purpose, Alessandra had a comfortable pair of sneakers on as she draped a cross-body bag over her torso.

Multi-tasking on her outing, the new 'expert' appeared to laugh at a conversation she was having via her wireless AirPods.

Alessandra placed her hair up in a low ponytail, and applied a neutral-hued makeup look for wherever she was headed.

She accessorized her casual-chic look with a simple necklace, and notably did not have any rings on her fingers.

Proving how organised she must be, Alessandra wrapped a jumper around her waist in case of cooler temperatures and packed a portable charger for her phone.

Nine's newest star was also seen wearing a stylish pair of red-framed glasses as she pulled out her phone to begin texting.

Alessandra will be replacing MAFS 'expert' Dr Trisha Stratford, who announced her departure from the show after seven seasons earlier this month. 

'I am thrilled to be joining John and Mel in Australia's biggest social experiment,' Alessandra said in a statement last week.

'With my particular expertise, I hope to contribute to the complex mix of components that ensure marriages not only work but thrive in the long haul.

'One of my strongest core beliefs is that sexual expression and compatibility are vital in building, nourishing and maintaining healthy romantic relationships, and it is my pleasure to help guide our participants in balancing this important factor in their brave quest for love.' 

The glamorous star will help Married At First Sight's existing 'experts' John Aiken and Mel Schilling pair 20 singles achieve their goal of creating ten perfect matches.

Married At First Sight's next season will be its eighth and is currently being produced by Endemol Shine Australia to premiere early next year.
