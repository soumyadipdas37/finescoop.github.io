Sydney Olympics legend Michael Diamond has reflected on battling his heart condition before making a miraculous recovery.   

The Australian shooting star, 48, has struggled through four years of 'hell' and even thought he hit rock bottom when his health began to deteriorate 18 months ago. 

Ten months later he made the shocking discovery his heart was failing.  

'I thought I would die. I thought, ''What about my three daughters … I'm going to leave them behind'',' Diamond told The Courier Mail.

The 48-year-old was forced to call an ambulance when he awoke one night to find a strange fluid around his stomach and legs. He was also struggling to breathe. 

Doctors told Diamond his heart was 'only just pumping' but could not explain why it was failing.

The Olympic champion was forced to live in hospital, with his heart functioning at 10 per cent capacity and doctors draining six litres of liquid from his stomach. 

Cardiac specialists filled out paperwork requesting a new heart for Diamond and the athlete had an infected gallbladder removed.

'The doctors were scared to hell. I was in hospital for a good three months, they kept an eye on me until my heart function got to more than 20 per cent,' he said. 

Diamond then proceeded to make a miraculous recovery that stunned surgeons and saw him completely avoid the need for a heart transplant. 

 Diamond's heart made a near complete recovery over the next 240 days and his doctors torn up the paperwork requesting a new heart.

The stunning turnaround came off the back of years of struggle for Diamond (pictured) who was pulled over for a breath test in May 2016 and was convicted of high-range drink driving as well as three firearm offences after a shotgun and ammunition was found in his car

The Olympian now takes five pills a day and said a combination of heart medication, diet and clean living helped him recover.

'It's been an amazing recovery. I won't need a new heart unless my own heart goes downhill, but my specialist is happy with the improvement,' he explained.

Diamond was pulled over for a breath test in May 2016 and was convicted of high-range drink driving as well as three firearm offences after a shotgun and ammunition was found in his car.  

He was later cleared of the firearm convictions but had been dropped from competing at the Rio olympics and left with $120,000 in medical and a legal bills.    

Diamond was on the brink of bankruptcy and was forced to sell his Sydney gold medal in 2017 for $72,000. 

He also auctioned off his first gold medal from Atlanta for $62,000 last December. 

Diamond started a laundromat business in Newcastle after his recovery and hopes to represent Australia at the Tokyo Olympics next year.
