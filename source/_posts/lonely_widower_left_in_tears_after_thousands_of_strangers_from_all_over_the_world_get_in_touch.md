A lonely OAP who put up a poster asking for friends after his wife died has been inundated with thousands of calls and emails from people who want to be his pal.

Tony Williams, 75, has received so many emails they crashed his inbox and he has had 100s of phone calls from new friends around the world.

People from America, Germany, Holland, Australia, Egypt, India and Japan have been in touch inviting him on road trips to the US or for an afternoon drinking G&Ts.

Others have offered Tony, a retired physicist lunches, phone calls and for their kids to adopt him as a grandfather.

Lonely Tony Williams, 75, who lives in Alton, East Hampshire, has received so many emails they crashed his inbox and he has had 100s of phone calls from new friends around the world

Tony, who lives in Alton, East Hampshire, said: 'The love and compassion people have shown has actually brought tears to my eyes.

'People have sent me the most delightful emails. They've sent me pictures of their kids, their pets, told me about their aspirations and telling me they are thinking of me.

'I got an email from a local teacher asking if children in her class could write me letters.

'I got in touch with her straight away and said it would be delightful. I would love that.

Tony said he was left without anyone to speak to after his wife Jo, 75, passed away in May, just nine days after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer

People have even been phoning Mr Williams from Canada and the United States.

'One lady phoned up and said if I get on a plane sometime she would pick me up and show me her area of Florida.

'Another lady who lives relatively nearby has invited me round for a G&T which I'll be keen to do.

'I've had others reach out from Germany, Holland, Australia, Egypt, India and Japan. It's just been gorgeous.

He would often be sat at home willing the phone to ring - 'but it never does' - and he said he feels 'cursed' by loneliness. Pictured: Tony now receives calls from Canada and the United States

'When I started responding they were coming in thick and fast. I would say about four or five a minute.

'The thing is, I can't respond now, as my email account seems to have crashed. A red message came up saying there was some sort of error and it needs to be reset.'

Tony and late wife Jo moved near to Alton last year so Jo could be closer to her sister, Beryl, 73.

But he said he was left without anyone to speak to after his wife Jo, 75, passed away in May, just nine days after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Tony married Jo, a secretary, A marriage to a woman he met at University College London (UCL) broke down, and in 1982 he married Jo, a secretary

They were unable to have children and he said he often sat at home willing the phone to ring - 'but it never does' - and he said he feels 'cursed' by loneliness.

Tony's neighbours said they have offered to help him - but he wants a friend of his own age to pass the time.

Without any family nearby, Tony put two adverts in his local newspaper looking for a friend to chat to, but didn't get any replies.

In a bid to find a pal to listen to music with, or just chat in the garden, Tony had business cards made, to hand out when he went to the supermarket or out for a walk.

Chatty Tony handed out dozens without receiving a call back, so decided to put a poster up in his window asking for pals.

But now, after spending a summer 'waiting for the phone to ring', Tony has been swamped by the responses.

He is enjoying chatting on the phone to strangers - now friends - from around the world, and plans to meet up with his new pals once Covid restrictions allow.

'I've just been completely overwhelmed and am so thankful for it all,' he said.
