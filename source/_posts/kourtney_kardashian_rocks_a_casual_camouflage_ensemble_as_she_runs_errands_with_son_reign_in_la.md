Kourtney Kardashian was glimpsed Thursday running an errand in Los Angeles with her five-year-old son Reign.

The 41-year-old reality TV superstar wore a flowing camouflage top and a pair of simple black leggings for her outing.

Sweeping her hair back into a ponytail she made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Kourtney shares Reign along with her two older children Mason, 10, and Penelope, eight, with her smoldering ex Scott Disick.

Her outing comes in the wake of news that Keeping Up With The Kardashians was coming to an end on E! after more than a decade. 

Keeping Up With The Kardashians soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of Kourtney and all five of her siblings.

Early last week a Page Six report alleged Kourtney's little sister Khloe, as well as Scott, were against the cancellation of the show.

By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'

Scott shares three children with Kris' eldest daughter Kourtney Kardashian - sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. 

Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.

The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.

Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'

To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'

However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.
