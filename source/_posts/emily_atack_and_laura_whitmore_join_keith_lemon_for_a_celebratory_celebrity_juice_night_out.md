Her new opponent jokingly hit back: 'I can't wait to see what Keith has got lined up for Emily and I this series… From past experiences, nothing would surprise me. I cannot wait to get stuck in and lead my team to victory each week… I love you Emily, but watch out! I'm so excited to start!

Farewell: In a sweet Instagram post, Holly thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' as she left just five months after former Top of the Pops star Fearne, also 39

In a sweet Instagram post, Holly thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' as she left just five months after former Top of the Pops star Fearne, also 39.  

Insiders previously claimed the decision came as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers. 

Although Holly had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.

She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term 'Holly Willoughbooby' was coined to described her curvaceous figure.

Her resignation came shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice's creators – stopped producing the show. 

Success: Celebrity Juice has proved to be enormously popular following its launch
