She celebrated her own birthday earlier this month with an eye-popping party in Jamaica, and for the past week has been feting her twin daughters, who are turning all of eight years old.

And Madonna again documented the festivities on her Instagram on Monday, posting video of an impromptu dance party on a tennis court that featured the birthday girls themselves Stella and Estere Ciccone, along with Madonna's older daughter Mercy James and son David Banda, both 14.

On her IG Stories, the Ray Of Light superstar also shared some gorgeous visuals from the fun, including some truly stunning snapshots of her youngest children.

The dance party inspired not only the Ciccone children to bust a move – their mother, 62 as of August 16th, also got up and cut the rug –– or, tennis court, as it were.

Madonna was in a luxurious beige embroidered sunhat, as well black and gold Versace leisure pants.

Her daughters Stella and Estere – whom she adopted from Malawi, Africa in the beginning of 2017 – modeled colorful blue and pink hair extensions, respectively, as they got in on the dancing fun.

Madonna's boyfriend Ahlamalik Williams, 26, was also present for the party, appearing in one Story snap with Madge seated on his lap, planting a smooch on his cheek.

The Material Girl's longtime friend and manager Guy Oseary was also among the guests, momentarily doing a breakdancing move, which Madonna called out in her caption. 

A lavish LOL Doll-themed cake was also part of the fun, which the girls blew out as their older brother David held it out for them.

The celebration comes after Madonna and her troupe were seen partying it up last week for the same occasion, when she shared a plethora of heart-warming snaps last Tuesday.

The Grammy-winner shared a selection of shots from their intimate family celebration on her Instagram Stories of her youngest girls opening their presents and blowing out the candles on their doughnut cake.

Madonna was all smiles as she posed with her daughters and their new doll after enjoying a family meal.
