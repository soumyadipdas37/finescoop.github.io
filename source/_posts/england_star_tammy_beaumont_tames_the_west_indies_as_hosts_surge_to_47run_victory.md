More than six months after rain robbed them of the chance to reach the T20 World Cup final at a packed MCG, England’s women began to get the disappointment out of their system with a resounding 47-run win over West Indies.

This was the first of five behind-closed-doors games at Derby in 10 days — and on this evidence England must be eyeing a series victory. Tammy Beaumont got them going with a powerful 62 off 49 balls, then the bowlers strangled the tourists, who made 116 for six.

For England this felt like the start of a new era after a season in which the visits of South Africa and India have fallen foul of the coronavirus pandemic.

ENGLAND: 163-8 (20 overs — Beaumont 62, Knight 25, A Jones 24; Selman 3-26, Matthews 2-25, Taylor 2-34)

WEST INDIES: 116-6 (20 overs — Dottin 69; Sciver 2-16, Ecclestone 2-19). 

Beaumont, back in her favoured opening role after spending much of the early part of the year tasting little success in the middle order, hammered her first T20 half-century in 16 innings — the perfect riposte to coach Lisa Keightley’s call for more oomph in the powerplay.

‘It’s good to be back at the top of the order,’ said Beaumont. 

‘I feel like I’ve been playing for my place a bit since January, which was probably fair enough. It made me look at my game, and go out there and be more aggressive.’

Quickfire twenties from captain Heather Knight and Amy Jones helped England to 163 for eight, though from 113 for two in the 14th over they should have done better.

West Indies needed 24 more than they had ever scored in a T20 game against England, and were soon in trouble. 

Deandra Dottin responded with a fluent 69, but no one else reached double figures. 

Katherine Brunt conceded only eight off her four overs. Game two is on Tuesday.
