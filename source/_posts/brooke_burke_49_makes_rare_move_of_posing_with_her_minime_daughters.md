Brooke Burke is not often seen with all four of her children.

But that changed this week as the former Dancing With The Stars co-host shared several images with her little ones while on the balcony of Nobu in Malibu as she celebrated her 49th birthday.

The former Playboy cover girl beamed as she had her children Neriah, Sierra, Heaven and Shaya with her as well as her current beau, real estate mogul Scott Rigsby.

Her little ones are not so little anymore: Brooke Burke shared images with her children while on the balcony of Nobu in Malibu as she celebrated her 49th birthday with her new beau

She looks just like mom: Here the model posed with her daughter Neriah, aged 20, whom she had with ex husband Garth Fisher

The Brooke Burke Body founder shares daughters Neriah, 20, and Sierra, 18, with her ex-husband, plastic surgeon Dr Garth Fisher, whom she was married to from 2001 to 2005. 

Her second set of children are Heaven, 13, and son Shaya, 12, who are from her ex-husband David Charvet of Baywatch fame. They were married to from 2011 to 2018.

Her girls looked happy as they were dressed up for the fancy Japanese dinner. 

Her other daughters: And she has Sierra, 18, with Fisher and Heaven, 13, with Charvet

They look like they could all be sisters! Brooke has retained her youthful appearance which means she could pass as a sibling of these girls

Proud of her posse: Brooke pointed out who was who in this image; the girls all have their own thriving social media accounts

And Burke's son looked just like dad Dave with winning good looks and a megawatt smile. 

The family all posted videos of their incredible food order to social media and capped it off by singing happy birthday to their mom as she and Scott shared a kiss overlooking the ocean. 

For her birthday outing Brooke stunned in a fire engine red pair of pants and a grey and white checkered blazer with candy cane sleeves that she layered over a simple white blouse. 

Another angle: Brooke also shared this image where all of the family was gathered

She sure hearts her girls: In this photo, the siren put a red heard around her image with Neriah



She continued to accentuate the red in her outfit as she carried a small matching clutch, clasping her black face mask in her other hand as she looked smitten with her boyfriend. 

She wore her brown curls styled down in beach waves for their Malibu dinner, wearing a simple pair of earrings and a statement thumb ring. 

Brooke's silver fox Scott kept it business casual in fitted grey jeans with a black belt. He topped the look off with a dark blue button down that exposed his toned upper body.   



A pal joined them: In this image Isaac Benedict is tagged as he poses with the family

Brooke was first linked to the successful real estate partner in 2019.

The two were seen in August at The Little Beach House Malibu, though their relationship was still new. 

Over the holiday weekend Brooke and her beau spent time at the beach getting some rays as she shared an Instagram selfie with a caption that quoted a Leon Bridges song to convey her happiness with her hunky man. 

When the kids were small: The cover girl posed with David Charvet and their two kids at the family Marvel Universe Live event in Los Angeles in 2015

They first stepped out publicly together a few months later in November at a charity benefit with Brooke telling reporters at an event that she 'really liked him'. 

 'He has two children and that is one of the things that I love most about him. He is really kind and responsible and devoted, so our kids are getting to know each other' she said. 

During quarantine the pair have been spending a lot of time together, even road tripping in a luxury RV to Lake Powell with the family. 

Since COVID-19 Brooke's fitness app Brooke Burke Body has been thriving as gyms have been closed, forcing many to seek fitness outlets via their phone from the privacy of their own home. 

Happiness: The fitness expert seems to be absolutely smitten with her boyfriend of a year Scott as they posted a smiley selfie to social media this summer
