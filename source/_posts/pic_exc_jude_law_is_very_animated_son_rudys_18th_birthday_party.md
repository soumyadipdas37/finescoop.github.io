Jude Law celebrated his son Rudy's 18th birthday on Thursday with a raucous party alongside wife Phillipa Coan ex Sadie Frost, and their family.

The actor, 47, appeared to be in great spirits as he threw his head back and laughed in delight before dancing in the street at the Locanda Locatelli Michelin starred restaurant in London.

Clearly having a great time, Jude was joined by Sadie's beau Darren Stroeger Jude's parents Peter and Maggie Law, his and Sadie's other children Rafferty and Iris law, her beau Jyrrel Roberts, Sadie's son Finlay Kemp, and her mum Mary Davidson.

The Alfie star put on a casual display in a grey floral print top over a white t-shirt, and he completed the look with a pair of black trousers.

Jude's brunet locks were slicked back over his head and he sported a close-cropped beard that gave him a ruggedly handsome look.

Putting on a cheery display, Jude busted out some moves while chatting outside with his loved ones, much to their amusement.

Jude and Sadie proved they were amicable exes as they said goodbye to his mother and father, as she gave Peter a kiss on the cheek while Jude hugged his mother.

Sadie looked stylish for the outing as she wore silver trousers and a dark grey top that she paired with a simple black blazer.  

Sadie and Jude used to lead the Primrose Hill Set, a name given to the all-star group of edgy residents of the leafy neighbourhood, who were known in their heyday for their wild ways with stories of their antics becoming the stuff of legend.

In the nineties they would spend their nights partying with the likes of Kate Moss, Davinia Taylor and Gavin Rossdale.

But things were not made to last, with Jude and Sadie getting a divorce in 2003, after six years of marriage.

In her autobiography Crazy Days, Sadie blamed depression that 'weaved a dance of destruction' through her adult life on the breakdown of their marriage.

Jude is now married to psychologist Phillipa, 32, who he was first spotted with at the Hay literary festival in 2015.

The couple got married at Old Marylebone Town Hall in London last year before partying in Mayfair – three months after the actor announced their engagement.

The actor also has an nine-year-old daughter Sophia with model Samantha Burke and Ada, four, with musician Catherine Harding.
