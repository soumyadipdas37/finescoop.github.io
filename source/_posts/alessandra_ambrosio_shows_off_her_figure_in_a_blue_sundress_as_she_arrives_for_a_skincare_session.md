She regularly shows off her impeccable skin on social media.

And Alessandra Ambrosio proved her commitment to clear skin on Tuesday as she arrived for a skincare appointment in Los Angeles.

The 39-year-old former Victoria's Secret Angel marked the end of summer by arriving for her session in a lovely pale blue sundress that showcased her trim figure.

Alessandra's sleeveless dress featured pale blue and white stripes running vertically, with lacing on the neckline.

She kept up the summery vibe with a pair of tan leather sandals, and she accessorized with a boxy white handbag with a graphic design on the side.

The 5ft 9in beauty arrived with her brunette locks tied up in a top knot with a scrunchie, but she let her shoulder-length locks down before departing.

She kept the sun out of her eyes with round-frame sunglasses and wore a tan cloth mask to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

In April of last year, Alessandra delved into her home skincare routine in an interview with Vogue.

'Brazilian beauty to me means natural; it means glowy,' she explained, after showing that she begins every day with a moisturizing SPF20 sunscreen.

Her routine extended beyond her face to cover her limbs and chest, as she said, 'I live in my bikini.'

On Monday, Alessandra showed off her elegantly bronzed skin in a series of Instagram photos taken at a beach in Malibu.

The catwalk star soaked up the sun while posing in a pink button-up shirt wit double breast pockets and set of white shorts that highlighted her tanned legs.

Alessandra has been quarantining for much of the pandemic with her two children, Anja, 12, and Noah, eight, whom she shares with her former fiancé Jamie Mazur. 

In 2018, it was revealed that she had split from Jamie following a decade-long engagement. 

'They [have] been trying to keep their split on the down low,' an insider told Us Weekly at the time.

'But Alessandra has been out and about ready to mingle and hasn't been taking Jamie to anything.'

'If I have been engaged to him for eight years, then it's not my priority,' Alessandra admitted to Cosmopolitan UK in 2016. 'I have a lot of things going on, and I haven't got married because I'm so busy. I'll think about that when I have time off.'  

More recently, she has been spending time with her Italian businessman beau, Nicolo Oddi, whom she's dated since 2018.

Last month, she and Jamie left California for a vacation with her two children to the crystal clear waters of the Maldives, where they celebrated Ana's 12th birthday.
