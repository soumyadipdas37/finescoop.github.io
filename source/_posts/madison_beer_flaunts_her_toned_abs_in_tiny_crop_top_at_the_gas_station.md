Madison Beer might have been visiting the gas station on Tuesday, but that didn't mean she was letting her sartorial standards slip. 

The 21-year-old showed off her toned abs as she filled up her red convertible Ferrari, wearing a tiny white crop top. 

Adding a casual spin to her look, she also wore tracksuit bottoms and Nike trainers, as well as a trucker cap.

And wearing a mask amid the Covid pandemic, she injected a further touch of glamour, opting for a leopard print design.  

Madison has had quite the month, recently dropping music from her debut album, before appearing on the MTV VMAs.

The Justin Bieber protégé is also focusing on her personal life, as she continues to fuel rumors of a new relationship.

She put on a sizzling display Monday in a country club chic look, as she stepped out for lunch with TikTok star Nick Austin, with whom she's been spending time lately.

The New York-born singer has recently been promoting her debut studio album Life Support, which is set to drop by end of summer. 

She recently told NME how mental health inspired the album: 'I was going through a really tough time when we were making this album. 

'I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I was in and out of dark mental states and in therapy three times a week.' 

Beer said of her team: 'They were just there to be a support system and that was another support system for me.

'I genuinely believe that the time I was creating my album and was genuinely suicidal, they were intertwined for a reason.'
