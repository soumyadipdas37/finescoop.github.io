A passenger was removed from an Allegiant Air flight on Monday after he asked a flight attendant to wear a face mask.

In a clip shared on Twitter, an elderly man is escorted off the plane at Punta Gorda, Florida, after he complained about an attendant who had lowered their mask to give the safety demonstration.

The video shows a number of passengers grumbling about his treatment as he was asked to leave the flight.

In other clips shared online, a passenger can be heard saying: 'You're supposed to be wearing a f***ing mask to begin with.'

The man then says to his fellow passengers: 'Why don't you all get off with me?'

The attendant then threatens law enforcement will arrive and deal with him if he refuses to leave.

Allegiant Air told Newsweek, 'The passenger was removed for repeatedly disrupting the pre-flight safety briefing which includes reiteration of our inflight face-covering policy.'

The airline added that 'the flight attendant giving the safety briefing lowered their mask for speaking into the PA so the briefing could be understood.'

They said a number of passengers complained they couldn't hear the announcements, prompting the attendant to lower their mask.

The man's 'disruptive' behaviour caused the attendant to then take action and their face mask was immediately put on after the briefing. 

The airline's website state: 'All crew members are required to wear a face covering at all times and gloves during inflight service.' 

After the video was shared on Twitter, a number of other incidents have surfaced on Twitter of passengers complaining about safety on Allegiant flights.

Some alleged that flight attendants were not wearing masks correctly, leaving their noses exposed during travel.

One wrote: '@Allegiant How am I supposed to feel safe flying when my chatty Kathy flight attendant isn’t even wearing her mask properly and keeps taking it off?!? Safety first or last...?' 

Despite this, the airline has been named one of the Top 10 safest airlines to travel with during Covid-19, according to Travel Pulse.
