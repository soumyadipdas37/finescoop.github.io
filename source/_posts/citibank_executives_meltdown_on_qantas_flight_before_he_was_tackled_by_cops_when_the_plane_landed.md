The wild details of a Citibank's executive's 'bizarre' behaviour on a plane before he was dramatically arrested have been revealed in court documents. 

Citibank Sydney managing director Thomas Hasan Dunmore Cribb, 39, became 'belligerent and aggressive' in the final hour of his Qantas flight from Auckland to Sydney on February 21. 

The executive, who was dubbed part of 'generation next' at the US bank, faced Sydney's Downing Centre Court over his outburst on Tuesday. 

He pleaded guilty to the obstruction of a Commonwealth officer and failing to comply with crew instructions. 

The drama began when Cribb asked for 'another scotch', prompting the flight attendant to hesitate before giving him the drink, according to the AFR. 

Cribb, a single father from Surry Hills, then began pestering a man in the seat in front of him, introducing himself twice to the stranger.

Later on, flight attendants called for electronic devices to be turned off or put on aeroplane mode -  but Cribb proceeded to have a loud conversation on the phone.

A flight attendant ordered Cribb to return to his seat five times but he said he 'just needed to p***' and went to toilet, according to The Daily Telegraph. 

The plane's captain called Australian Federal Police officers to meet the flight at the gate and remove Cribb. 

Cribb whined as he left the flight and launched a tirade of abuse at officers.    

'How dare you. I can't believe this is Australia, am I under arrest? 

'You have no idea who I am. You don't realise how big a mistake you've just made. You're gone. I'm taking your badge. You've just f****d up,' Cribb told police. 

Cribb repeatedly ignored cabin crew instructions and attempted to kick at police officers who were called to Sydney Airport (NSW Police officers pictured at Sydney Airport) 

Cribb demanded to see a Qantas staff member and a scuffle broke out as police attempted to arrest the banker.  

The 39-year-old then tried to kick at two of the officers as he was tackled to the ground.   

Cribb told police he wouldn't say anything until he could call speak to his lawyer but later apologised to an officer for injuring his thumb.   

'Yeah, I f****d up. I'm really sorry. I had a few drinks,' he told officers at the AFP's Sydney police station.    

Cribb later apologised for lashing out at police and the court heard the Citibank executive would be receiving a salary cut (Citibank headquarters pictured in New York city) 

Cribb's lawyer said the banker had faced the Citibank board and would have his salary reduced after the incident. 

His lawyer also noted Cribb's behaviour was 'bizarre' and out of character, providing multiple 'glowing' character references that described him as 'a gentle soul'. 

Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said she had taken into account Cribb's remorse, his lack of prior offences and the character references. 

She ordered Cribb to pay a $1,000 fine and continue seeing his psychologist while placing him on a two years good behaviour bond without conviction.
