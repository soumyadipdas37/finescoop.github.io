As working from home becomes the new norm, there's been a rise in demand for athleisure and luxe loungewear, not to mention childhood nostalgia that makes us feel warm and fuzzy inside

Since COVID-19 the way we live has drastically shifted. 

As working from home becomes the new norm, there's been a rise in demand for athleisure and luxe loungewear, not to mention childhood nostalgia that makes us feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

The two celebrity-loved brands have teamed up to offer a collection that blends contemporary fashion with sentimental feelings.

Reinterpreting classic Juicy Couture silhouettes (early 2000s staples!) with the Kappa aesthetic, they have tapped into what we all desire from our clothes right now - to be comfortable and look cute!

The collaboration features fitted tracksuits, tube tops, belted bum bags, slides and more in a pastel palette of mint and blush, along with neutral offerings in a shade of black smoke. 

The debut drop (out today!) is a collection fully composed in delicate silk satin, followed by a second drop featuring Juicy Couture's quintessential fabric velour, just in time for fall.

Each design includes the signature Kappa Omini logo depicting a man and woman sitting back-to-back with the Juicy Couture Old English initial J entwined with a C. 

The collaboration wouldn't be complete without the iconic Juicy stamp in Old English across the seat of track pants.

'The Kappa tracksuit has been an instantly recognizable icon over the last 50 years through the sponsorships of renowned soccer teams like Barcelona FC and US teams,' said Lorenzo Boglione, VP of Sales at Kappa.

'One might consider our tracksuits with the iconic BANDA logo tape as the original athleisurewear. 

'A special collaboration with Juicy Couture and the classic feminine velour tracksuit felt like an instinctive fit. We felt it only natural to merge our distinctive codes; resulting in something both comfortable and glamorous.' 

The Kappa x Juicy Couture collection ranges from $40 - $225. 

The first drop is available for purchase exclusively from September 10th – 13th at a pop-up in Los Angeles before becoming available at global retailers online on September 15th.
