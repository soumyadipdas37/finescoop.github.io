Chelsea have been handed a huge boost in their pursuit of Bayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz after his manager confirmed he has had his final training session at the club.

Frank Lampard's side have held a long-standing interest in the 21-year-old and the £90million move looks to be edging closer. 

'Unfortunately, our squad has not yet been determined,' Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz said on Monday.

'I don't expect Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz to train with us again.

'It is possible that other players will also change. We definitely need to bring in players.'

Havertz checked in for international duty with Germany on Monday ahead of UEFA Nations League clashes against Spain and Switzerland this week.

Lampard is continuing to rebuild his Blues side this summer after finishing fourth in his debut season in charge.

Havertz's fellow Germany team-mate Timo Werner made the switch from RB Leipzig to Stamford Bridge for £53m, following £38m Hakim Ziyech through the door.

The Blues recently added Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell to their growing list of new signings with the England international completing a £50m switch last week.

They also bolstered their options at the back with the signings of Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva on a free transfer and French defender Malang Sarr.
