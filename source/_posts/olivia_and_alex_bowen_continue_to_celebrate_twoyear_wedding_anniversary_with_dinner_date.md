They marked their two-year wedding anniversary with a lavish dinner at Scott's on Tuesday.

And Olivia and Alex Bowen kept the good times rolling as they continued to ring in their milestone by dining at STK in central London on Wednesday.

The former Love Island star, 26, ensured all eyes were on her as she slipped into a ruched crop top while walking hand-in-hand with her handsome man, 29.

Flashing a hint at her toned abs, the blonde teamed her Missguided bralet with a pair of sophisticated wide-leg trousers by Coast.

Pointed heels, a mini Balenciaga handbag and a dainty gold necklace rounded off her outfit, while her bouncy curls framed her perfectly dewy face.

The couple pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London earlier in the week.

Their solid relationship has gone the distance after they first got together and are one of the rare Love Island romances that have not fizzled out. 

The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance.

When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.

'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.

'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.

'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.'
