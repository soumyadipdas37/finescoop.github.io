Australian bargain hunters are flocking to discount chain The Reject Shop as the first Tesco-branded grocery items finally hit the shelves.

The discount retailer signed a million-dollar deal with Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, to be able to sell its top items four months ago.

The groundbreaking supply deal comes as The Reject Shop tries to reposition itself as a bigger player on the Australian retail scene.  

Sure to be a hit with British expats, the range includes Tesco Gold Instant Coffee 100g for $6, tinned vegetable soup, bottles of vinegar and packets of rice cakes for $2 and Tesco biscuits are range from $2 to $2.50. 

The products are currently available at all stores in New South Wales, Canberra and Queensland, meanwhile Victoria will have the range at the end of the week

The Reject Shop CEO Andre Reich said the supply deal meant huge savings were here to stay.

'We've teamed up with one of the biggest supermarkets in the world selling their best-selling lines. The higher the volume we buy, the cheaper it will be for customers,' he said.

'A lot of people are struggling to make ends meet, that's one thing COVID has taught us. We're all facing tough economic times. This is about giving Australians the best-quality products at the best price,' he told news.com.au.

The discount chain, which first launched four decades ago, is eyeing up the likes of Aldi and Kmart and already employs over 5,300 workers across Australia, generating more than $800million in sales each year. 

The products are now available at all stores in New South Wales, Canberra and Queensland, while Victoria will have the range at the end of the week.

South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia will have the new grocery items by the end of September.

Because of Tesco's buying power, The Reject Shop has assured customers it will always be fully stocked with cheap items. 

In August, financial services firm Morgan Stanley suggested the The Reject Shop could become a $3billion stock within the next 10 years as it moves towards a younger consumer-based feeling the economic pinch from COVID-19. 

As well as dry-store packaged food, Tesco will also supply The Reject Shop with a range of health and beauty products in coming months as well as other household items.

Although both parties admit the unusual deal may take some customers by surprise, Tesco Group Export Director Jack Brabin said it will be a major windfall for Australian consumers - along with the 1.2 million British expats living Down Under.

'We're delighted to be partnering with The Reject Shop to provide a range of fantastic Tesco products across grocery and baby care,' he said.

'As the UK's leading food retailer, we take enormous care to ensure our products are the best quality and offer great value. We look forward to sharing them with The Reject Shop's customers.
