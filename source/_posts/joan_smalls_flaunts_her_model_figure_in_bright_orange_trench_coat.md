She's one of the most beautiful women in the world who has modelled for countless high-fashion brands.

And Joan Smalls flaunted her model figure in a bright orange trench coat at Burberry's virtual London Fashion Week show on Thursday. 

The Puerto Rican beauty, 32, looked incredible in the stylish outfit as she strutted her stuff down the runway.

The model looked chic in white trousers and a long white top adorned with the brand name that featured a lace trim.

She wowed in the buttoned tangerine trench coat and elongated her long legs in a pair of heeled leather boots. 

Joan wore her curly brunette tresses loose over her shoulders and opted for a natural makeup look to keep all eyes of her outfit.

The fashion house was displaying Riccardo Tisci's Spring/Summer 2021 collection, called In Bloom, during the show.

Vibrant blue tones filled the catwalk, with models wearing the bold colour as trousers, trench coats and shorts.

Explaining some of the design features, Burberry said the performance was conceived by Riccardo Tisci and artist Anne Imhof before being staged for a digital audience.

Speaking about the show, Tisci said: 'As humans, we have always had a deep affinity to nature. We have had to respect and rely upon its power for our very existence, whilst marvelling and revelling in its extraordinary beauty. 

'Especially recently, we have all yearned to reconnect again. For this show, I wanted to celebrate these feelings by bringing our community together in a creative experience that takes place within the beautiful, natural landscape of Britain.' 

In line with Burberry's previous two runway shows, the outdoor experience will be certified carbon neutral.
