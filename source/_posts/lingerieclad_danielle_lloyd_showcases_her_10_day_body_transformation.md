Danielle Lloyd has unveiled her 10 day body transformation. 

Following her recent holiday to Turkey, where she admitted she had drank and eaten 'whatever she wanted', the CBB star underwent a health overhaul. 

Taking to Instagram on Thursday, she shared six images showing her before and after images while posing in lingerie.

Danielle was plugging her Ketone diet in the post, as she admitted she has slimmed down thanks to her new drink and no exercise. 

Sharing a lengthy caption, she penned: 'So 10 days ago I decided to do one of my 10 day challenges. I’d been on a few holidays and drank and eaten what I wanted...

'I’ve lost 3lb but as you can see my body shape and bloat has definitely changed along with my energy and focus I just feel so much better in myself...

'This is no alcohol for the 10 days but no exercise either I just couldn’t get the gym with the kids being off school...

'It’s 2 simple drinks a day with no diet. I did limit my carbs intake but had them each day and even had @halotopuk and chocolate (not everyday)

Am going to continue on with another 10 day challenge starting from today and will post the results from them also. #ketones #ketonesforfuel #10daychallenge #missketones'.

Danielle recently had to quarantine for 14 days after heading to Ibiza with her partner after the government pulled its air bridge with Spain following a spike in COVID-19 cases. 

Oh my! Taking to Instagram on Thursday, she shared six images showing her before and after images while posing in lingerie



The TV star married her partner Michael in April 2019 and they share a son called Ronnie together who is two years old.

Danielle is also mother to her sons Archie, 11, Harry, nine and George, seven, who she shares with former spouse and professional football player, Jamie O'Hara, 33. 

The mother-of four revealed she suffered a tragic miscarriage last year but still dreams of having a baby daughter in the fiture.

Danielle even revealed her sons are keen to have a little sister and she said she had been to Dubai's gender selection clinic, the Fakih IVF centre in August last year as she considers having treatment to conceive a baby girl. 

The former glamour model admitted she 'can't think about having a baby at the moment' but would 'love a little girl' during an appearance on Loose Women. 

She said: 'I'm in two minds, I've just got a puppy who is a little girl so she's my baby at the moment. I would love a little girl but four boys is a lot.'
