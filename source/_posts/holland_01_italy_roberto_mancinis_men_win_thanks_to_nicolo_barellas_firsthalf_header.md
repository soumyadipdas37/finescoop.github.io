Italy picked up their first win of this year's Nations League with a stunning win over the Netherlands in Amsterdam to leapfrog their rivals in the table. 

Inter Milan midfielder Nicolo Barella scored a superb team goal in first-half stoppage time which saw intricate passes from Jorginho, Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne. 

Roberto Mancini's side could have doubled their lead in the second-half but Immobile and Everton striker Moise Kean spurned good opportunities from the edge of the area.

Holland, who are playing under interim coach Dwight Lodeweges following Ronald Koeman's departure to Barcelona, threatened in patches with their best chance coming from Liverpool midfielder Gini Wijnaldum firing straight at Gianluigi Donnaruma in the Italy goal.

The result sees Mancini's men overtake Holland in the Group A1 table after two matches, while it also stretches the Netherland's record over Gli Azzurri to just one win in 42 years.
