Hey, good lookin'!

Welcome to the most eye-catching hotels in the world – architectural gems so aesthetically pleasing that they've been deemed worthy of inclusion in the Design Hotels collection, 'a handpicked portfolio of one-of-a-kind properties across the globe'.

Here we present our picks of a most impressive crop, from a jaw-dropping resort in the Maldives (with its own marine biologist) to a boutique property set in ancient caves in Italy and from a stunningly renovated manor house in Manchester to a 'spectacular' Thai beach house the Kardashians stayed in.

Seaside Finolhu Maldives 

Seaside Finolhu Maldives employs an on-site marine biologist to tend to flora and fauna

Contemporary architectural design mixes harmoniously with rustic touches, says Design Hotels

Private villas are constructed with natural thatch roofs and light and unassuming exteriors that blend in with nature

So dedicated is Seaside Finolhu Maldives to giving its guests a pristine tropical eco-system to ensconce themselves in that it employs an on-site marine biologist to tend to flora and fauna.

The resort also places a premium on offering jaw-dropping accommodation – there are 125 private villas, half of which have a pool.

The Design Hotels website, designhotels.com, says of the architecture: 'Contemporary architectural design mixes harmoniously with rustic touches throughout the resort, with modern-style buildings fashioned using Maldivian influences. Though formidable, spacious, and embracing on the inside, the private villas are constructed with natural thatch roofs and light, unassuming exteriors that enable them to disappear into the surrounding natural flora.'
