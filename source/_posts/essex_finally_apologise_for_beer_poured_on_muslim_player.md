On Tuesday, Essex finally apologised for the celebrations that soured their Bob Willis Trophy final triumph when one of their young players poured beer over a Muslim team-mate.

A photo of Will Buttleman pouring alcohol over Feroze Khushi on the Lord’s balcony on Sunday after the draw against Somerset that earned Essex the new trophy forced them to release a statement that pledged greater cultural education of their players but stopped short of saying sorry.

But on Tuesday night captain Tom Westley put that right when he issued a further statement that said: ‘On behalf of myself and the team we would like to apologise for any offence that was caused by our celebrations at Lord’s.

 Essex vowed to improve the cultural education of their players after their BWT victory

‘As a group we have come together and discussed the event and on reflection we are disappointed we let this happen. Moving forward the squad will be more responsible and aware of our actions.’ 

A photo of the incident provoked anger in East London's British-Asian cricket community, with one senior figure describing Will Buttleman’s decision to empty his bottle over the head of Khushi as ‘diabolical’, and calling on Essex to apologise.

The 21-year-old Khushi, who made his first-team debut last month but did not play in the BWT final against Somerset, appeared uncomfortable as Buttleman, 20, poured beer over him – a contrast with England’s policy of allowing their Muslim players (and teetotaller Mark Wood) to step aside before champagne is sprayed. 

Essex said that the incident ‘did not meet the inclusive values of the organisation’

Tom Westley made an apology on Tuesday night, after the club's statement failed to do so

The club's statement after the incident said: ‘Essex pride themselves on their work within multi-diverse communities throughout the county and the surrounding areas. 

‘For a substantial period of time, Essex have had a multi-diverse team with players from different backgrounds, religions, and races, where cricket is at the heart of these communities.

‘The club has worked extremely hard and will continue to bring cricket to anybody and everybody, and educate on diversity, but further work needs to be done across both sport and society in general, to widen people’s knowledge and make them more aware of cultural differences.’ 

The controversy takes place at a sensitive time for race relations in English cricket, after a summer in which several members of the game’s past and present BAME community have spoken out about their experiences in county dressing-rooms.
