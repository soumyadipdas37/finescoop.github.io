He was a proud supporter of his wife Victoria at her London Fashion Week presentation on Monday where he donned a range of stylish outfits.

But David Beckham cut a much more casual figure as he stepped out in Notting Hill to pick up a takeaway on Tuesday.

The football ace, 45, kept it low-key in a white t-shirt, blue jeans and green neon trainers as he headed back to his Land Rover Defender with his food.

The father-of-four made sure to put safety first as he donned a black face covering for the outing in the capital.

He added a splash of colour to his casual look with a bright orange beanie as he hopped into his car.

David flashed his many arm tattoos as he made his way down the street carrying his purchases.

Just the day before he proved he has passed on his style to two of his sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, as he took them, along with their sister Harper, nine, to wife Victoria's digital London Fashion Week show in a series of garish looks. 

Following the show, David took to Instagram to make a joke out of his socks and sandals look while Victoria, 46, also joked about the day as she shared a snap while lying in bed and hinted the day had left her exhausted.  

Victoria was forced to ditch her usual London Fashion Week catwalk show in favour of a digital presentation, but she had her number one fans by her side as they attended in their somewhat edgy ensembles.

The Spice Girl turned fashion designer shared images of her family throughout the day while David was also documenting things - including his own outfit. 

Sharing snaps showing him with the kids - bar Brooklyn - David penned over the top: ''I think the boys may be judging my socks with sliders'.

Showing their edgy styles run in the family, Cruz opted for a bang on-trend Dior saddlebag worn across his chest. Romeo proved himself to be quite the trendy lad himself as he went for a sleeveless knitted tank top.

David thanked Dior's creative director Kim Jones for the ensembles. 

Victoria, like most designers, has opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week as the coronavirus pandemic uproots fashion weeks around the globe. 

Victoria captioned her snaps: 'My favourite (and only) guests this season! love you all so much @davidbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven xx we missed you @brooklynbeckham @nicolannepeltz.' 

Pooped! Following the show yesterday, David took to Instagram to make a joke out of his socks and sandals look while Victoria, 46, also joked about the day as she shared a snap while lying in bed and hinted the day had left her exhausted

After the show, she felt the need to unwind however.  

The Beckhams ensured they all had their own masks, with Harper opting to wear a purple floral one to match her dress.

Hours earlier Victoria had shared a snap of daughter Harper donning a mini version of one of her designs ahead of the digital showcase.
