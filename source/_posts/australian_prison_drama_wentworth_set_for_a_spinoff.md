Wentworth has finished filming its 100th and final episode ever after eight seasons.

And as diehard fans already pine for a spin-off, producer Jo Porter told The Courier Mail's SMARTdaily on Tuesday that you should 'never say never'.

While she's open to the possibility, Jo went on to say that she's content on the eighth season being the end.

Is this REALLY the end? Producer of Australian prison drama Wentworth, Jo Porter, revealed to The Courier Mail's SMARTdaily on Tuesday whether a spin-off is on the cards, after filming wrapped on the final season 

'There's a few characters who survive, there are possibilities, but at the moment we're focusing on this being a beautiful bow to draw a close to this chapter.'

Jo added that as a producer, it's an 'absolute art' to know when a series should end.

'We are going out on a high... because you've gone out on a high there's the chance to potentially come back, but we're not committing to that just yet. It's too soon.' 

'Never say never': While she's open to the possibility, Jo (pictured in 2018) said that she's content on the eighth season being the end: 'Because you've gone out on a high there's the chance to potentially come back, but we're not committing to that just yet. It's too soon' 

Keen: Pamela Rabe who plays Joan 'The Freak' Ferguson (pictured in 2016), also told SMARTdaily that she hopes 'the stories would keep going' as there's 'still life' left

Earlier this month, the cast and crew of the acclaimed drama said their final goodbyes on the Melbourne set.

TV Tonight reported that the show's line producer Sue Edwards and head of production Brett Popplewell, were notably congratulated in speeches for their efforts in managing filming under strict COVID-19 restrictions.

Foxtel also sent individual bottles of Champagne to the show's team for completing filming, according to the publication. 

Wentworth's producer Pino Amenta shared a few photos of the final day on Twitter.

He wrote: 'Last day of Shooting on Wentworth. What a glorious experience it's been working with such wonderful people.

'Will miss the whole damn thing! Very emotional day, thanks to every single one of them,' he added.

Among the photos he shared were of the actors on set, as well as a picture of the cast after filming - with all wearing face masks.

Wentworth, which is a fresh take on iconic 1980s series Prisoner, has garnered plenty of critical acclaim, winning several AACTA and Logie awards over the years.

It has also aired in several countries, including New Zealand, the UK and Ireland, where it has developed a devoted fan base.

The Foxtel produced series was also popular with Australian audiences, who even petitioned hard to save the show from cancellation after the seventh season.

Despite this, the drama proved too expensive and limited to continue funding, leading Foxtel to confirm season eight would be Wentworth's final season.

Part one of season eight is currently airing on screens. Part two will air next year.
