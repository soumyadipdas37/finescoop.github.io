Radio presenter Fifi Box has taken another day off work as she mourns the death of Jaimi Kenny - the eldest daughter of her ex-partner Grant Kenny.

Fifi, who shared a close bond with Jaimi despite splitting from her father eight years ago, was absent from Fox FM's Fifi, Fev and Byron show on Wednesday morning.

Her absence for the second day in a row was briefly mentioned at 6am.

The 43-year-old also wasn't on the air on Tuesday, with her co-host Byron Cooke telling listeners at the start of the broadcast: 'Well, Fi is away today but the show must go on.'

Trying to lift the team's spirits, Brendan Fevola added: 'We're a team, we're one and one, we're going to mould into one and just nail it.

'If we're in the Titanic, I've got my arms around you. I'll carry you, bro.'

Later that morning, a visibly strained Fifi was pictured leaving her father's home in Melbourne, just hours after learning of Jaimi's death at the age of 33.

Jaimi wasn't just her ex-partner's daughter, she was also the older half-sister of Fifi's child Trixie Belle, whom she welcomed in 2013 after a brief relationship with Grant.

Despite splitting with Grant months before giving birth to Trixie, Fifi remained close to his children from his first marriage: Jaimi, Morgan and Jett. 

Jaimi would even babysit her much younger half-sister on occasion while single mum Fifi was at work.

Fifi hasn't commented publicly on Jaimi's death.

Blended family: Fifi and Grant dated for several months in 2012, but had split by the time she welcomed daughter Beatrix 'Trixie' Belle (pictured) via IVF in 2013

Jaimi's mother, three-time Olympian Lisa Curry, separated from Grant in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017. 

Fifi and Grant dated for several months in 2012, but had broken up by the time she welcomed daughter Beatrix 'Trixie' Belle via IVF the following year.

She did not acknowledge Grant was Trixie's father until 2016, when she shared a photo to Instagram of the retired athlete attending their child's third birthday party.

In June 2019, Fifi welcomed another daughter, Daisy Belle, via IVF and an anonymous donor. The identity of Daisy's father is not public knowledge.

The Curry-Kenny family confirmed Jaimi's death in a statement on Monday afternoon.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement by Jaimi's father, Grant.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child.

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'

While the family's statement did not specify the exact nature of Jaimi's illness, it's understood she had long battled an eating disorder.

The daughter of Australian sporting greats Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic.

Jaimi Kenny passed away at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father.

The 33-year-old had been supported by her parents and siblings through many years of treatment at private clinic End ED, on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.

Shattered staff at the clinic said they could not discuss Jaimi's struggle, but told how she became part of the 'family' over the years.

Despite her struggles with weight, friends of Jaimi told how she always brought 'light and laughter' to the lives of those she around her. 

Lisa Curry marked her daughter's death with a tragic statement.

'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' Lisa wrote.

'So loved. So beautiful. So kind to everyone... So painful. I can barely breathe.'
