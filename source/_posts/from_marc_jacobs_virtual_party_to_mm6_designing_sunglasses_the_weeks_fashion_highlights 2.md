When it comes to fashion, we are all inspired by what we see; whether it be a well-dressed celebrity, a blow-your-mind catwalk presentation or even a super stylish every-day passerby.

As fashion editors, we're moved by all of the above, and then some. We're exposed to under-the-radar labels; we get a first-hand look at collections months before they hit stores; we're tapped into brands with chic-yet-cheap offerings and we shop - a lot.

To share our knowledge, FEMAIL brings you Style Swoon, a weekly series of the latest, greatest and on the verge. We hope this Friday series will serve as a buying guide and point of inspiration for the clotheshorses and fashion fanatics alike.

MM6 (Maison Margiela's contemporary line) expands its avant-garde vision of fashion to eyewear by teaming up with Berlin-based eyewear brand MYKITA

MYKITA + MM6 Maison Margiela

MM6 (Maison Margiela's contemporary line) expands its avant-garde vision of fashion to eyewear by teaming up with Berlin-based eyewear brand MYKITA to create a line of sunglasses with attitude.

The collaboration takes inspiration from the MM6 fall 2020 collection of circular silhouettes.

Almost every garment from MM6's fall 2020 collection was cut in a circular pattern, so that jackers, blazers and vests sloped down arms and dresses hung with full-circle skirts. 

Oversized yet ultra-lightweight, the handcrafted sunglasses showcase the unique possibilities of the MYLON material and the technology of 3D manufacturing. 

The eyewear is available in a neutral color palette consisting of white, nude, black and blue with a bit of red peppered in. 

The MYKITA + MM6 Maison Margiela special edition is available now at MYKITA and MM6 boutiques as well as selected stores. Styles retail for approximately $500.

Beautiisoles seeks to fuse style and comfort with a selection of fashionable footwear designed to feel good

BEAUTIISOLES LAUNCHES

No pain, no gain?  Not if Beautiisoles has anything to do with it!

The newly launched shoe brand seeks to fuse style and comfort with a selection of fashionable footwear designed to feel good.

The shoes are created by snack food manufacturing executive and competitive ballroom dancer Robyn Shreiber and fashion designer Daniella Clarke, founder of women’s denim brand Frankie B. 

'We are an affordable luxury shoe brand with an emphasis on comfort,' explains Robyn, who came up with the idea for the brand after experiencing a foot injury, which developed after years of wearing uncomfortable shoes.   

In 2018 the entrepreneur partnered with Danielle Clarke who Robyn calls "the most famous woman in jeans."

'I've always had a passion for shoes,' said Daniella. 'I’m completely shoe obsessed, and yet women have been struggling with this fashion dilemma for decades.'

What sets Beautiisoles apart from other brands on the market is that their shoes are designed with a wider toe box and greater heel support.

'Using cutting edge technology for an ever-expanding range of silhouettes, our shoes will absorb shock, wick sweat, and provide antibacterial properties,'  Daniella said.

Made for the modern day gal, 'we have multiple looks, fabrications and colors for any occasion; everything from a hot date to a board meeting.'

Prices range from $245 - $385.
