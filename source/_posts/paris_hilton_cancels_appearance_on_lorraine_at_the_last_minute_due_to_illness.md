Paris Hilton cancelled an interview on ITV's Lorraine at the last minute after suddenly falling ill.

The reality star, 39, was scheduled to have a chat with Lorraine Kelly about her YouTube documentary where she speaks about abuse she endured as a teen.

Speaking to Ross King, Lorraine said: 'We were supposed to be talking to Paris Hilton today. Sadly we got a call very, very late last night saying that's she's not well.'

'We obviously wish her well and hope she gets better soon.'

Lorraine addressed some of the themes from the documentary This Is Paris, including the persona Paris said she put on during her early years of fame. 

She said: 'When I watched the documentary I thought, "Not a happy life". She's invented this character and even speaks in a funny voice. 

'I thought that was her voice but it's not at all! She's a bright girl but she puts on an act.'

Ross agreed and said: 'That’s not her voice, she’s a sharp cookie. We talk about the Kardashians as well, Kim was Paris’ pal. Paris set the way for her.'

Lorraine added: 'I think she's someone desperately looking for love and desperately looking for validation, I suppose. It's just very sad.

'I hope she comes back, I would love to speak to her.'

It comes after Paris admitted she felt 'pressured' into making her sex tape with her 'first real boyfriend' Rick Salomon.

In the documentary, she compared the ordeal to being 'electronically raped' and admitted she wasn't 'in the right head space' after the video leaked online.

Filmed at the height of their relationship in 2001, the home-made movie was subsequently sold by poker player Rick, 52, following their separation in 2004 and distributed with the title 1 Night In Paris.

According to The Sun, the media personality reflected: 'It was my first real relationship. Eighteen. I was so in love with him and I wanted to make him happy.

Fame: Ross King agreed and said: 'That’s not her voice, she’s a sharp cookie. We talk about the Kardashians as well, Kim was Paris’ pal. Paris set the way for her' 

'And I just remember him pulling out the camera. And he was kind of pressuring me into it. It was like being electronically raped.'

Sharing her thoughts on whether the outcome would have been the same if the tape was released today, the heiress added: 'That was a private moment of a teenage girl, not in her right head space, but everyone was watching it and laughing like it's something funny.

'If that happened today, it would not be the same story at all, but they made me the bad person. I did something bad...I was just so lost and desperate for love that I found the worst possible person.'
