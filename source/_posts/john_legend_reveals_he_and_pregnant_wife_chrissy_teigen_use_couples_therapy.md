John Legend has revealed he and his wife Chrissy Teigen use couples' therapy to help strengthen their seven-year marriage. 

In a new interview with Cosmopolitan UK, the musician, 41, detailed the secrets to their long-lasting relationship and credited the coronavirus lockdown for allowing him to spend more time with his daughter Luna, four, and son Miles, two.

The singer also admitted he and the model, 34 - who are expecting their third child together - were 'surprised' to discover they had conceived naturally for the first time after facing fertility challenges as their older kids were welcomed through IVF.

Ordinary People hitmaker John and the Sports Illustrated star tied the knot in  September 2013, seven years after they met on the set of his music video for his track Stereo.

On how they've managed to keep their romance strong, the artist told the publication: 'It sounds obvious, but being with someone you really care about, respect and enjoy being around. I think that’s the crucial foundation. 

'Then communicating, being considerate, listening to your partner and making sure their needs are met.

The media personality also explained the importance of receiving advice and guidance from others as he added: 'And we go to therapy sometimes.

'I think every couple who has been together for a long time could use time to talk with a third party to help with whatever concerns they have.'

The COVID-19 pandemic provided many celebrities with the luxury of enjoying a rare break from their typically busy schedules.

In John's case, he's been able to spend more time with his children, an experience he describes as 'heaven'.

The belter, who was forced to postpone his Bigger Love tour to next year, said: 'We’re spending a lot of time with each other and that means our kids are in heaven.

'Their ideal situation is to hang out with us all day, every day. A downside for me is that we had to cancel my tour. I’ve released a new album and want to be out there performing the songs to people.'

Last month, John and Chrissy shocked fans when they announced they are expanding their family in the music video for his new single Wild.  

'It was truly a surprise. We had struggled to conceive naturally all this time and figured it would never happen', he confessed. I guess all of our time spent at home together was enough to conquer any fertility challenges we had.

'We thought it couldn’t happen this way and were worried that something would go wrong but, so far, all the tests have come back great and we feel very good.'

The Conversations in the Dark also revealed he is yet to discuss the significance of the Black Lives Matter movement with Luna and Miles due to their age, following the death of unarmed black man George Floyd at the hands of police. 

The Ohio native said: 'It’s difficult because at some point you have to have conversations with the kids about what it means to be who they are, to have brown skin and to come from the ancestry they do. 

'It’s a little early for both of them to know all the details about what’s going on with police brutality.'

Insisting he instils self-love and acceptance within the Legend household, the Jesus Christ Superstar actor said: 'At this point, we only talk about their race and try to make them believe they’re valuable and worthy, and that their skin and hair is beautiful the way it is.'

The songwriter also shared how being a father has changed him, stating: 'It gives you a sense of purpose greater than yourself. You can help influence the next generation and they can make the world a better place. 

'It makes you think about work priorities. As soon as we had Luna, I thought more about my work schedule and how much I wanted to be home. 

'It’s a different kind of love. You feel love for them because they’re yours, but you feel this responsibility for them as well.'

Elsewhere in the interview, John spoke about his unlikely interest in ITV2 dating series Love Island, revealing he watches the show with subtitles 'depending on where they're from'.

He said: 'Within the UK, some of the accents I can’t quite follow. We’ve watched a few seasons of it. It’s quite all encompassing. So many hours of content. Luckily we’ve had a lot of free time lately.'
