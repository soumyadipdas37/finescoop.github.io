Last month, she named him as her assailant on an Instagram Live, where she told him to stop 'lying' and defended her decision not to tell the cops, at the scene, what happened.  

The rap star said she thought cops would kill them if they learned there was a gun in the car and claims she made an attempt to 'spare' Lanez, 28, by holding back the truth. 

Yet, Hot Girl Meg said she was now 'tired' of the rumors being spread by Lanez' team, telling her followers 'stop acting like black women is the m***********g problem.' 

In an Instagram Live Thursday night, Megan Thee Stallion claimed Canadian rapper Tory Lanez shot her in the foot on July 12 after they had an argument and she tried to leave the ca

Her Instagram Story, which occurred more than a month later, was the first time she directly used Lanez' name to accuse him of being the shooter.  

'I'm not gonna let you all keep playing in my face and I'm not going to let this n**** keep playing in my face either,' she began. 

'Since you're all so worried about it, yes, this n**** Tory shot me.

'You shot me and you got got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and s**t. Stop lying. Why lie.'

She then blasted some of the rumors circulating that she had hit him before she was shot, claiming that there was a witness who saw how she got out of the car and was walking away when Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, allegedly began to shooting at her from the back seat.

She also hit out at claims that it happened at Kylie Jenner's house, where the pair had been partying earlier that evening, saying that they were five minutes from where she was staying when she decided she had enough of an argument and tried to leave the vehicle. 

'I get out of the car. I'm done, I don't want to argue no more,' she said. 

 'I get out, I'm walking away and this n**** from out the backseat of the car starts shooting me. You shot me. I didn't get cut by no glass but I'll tell you why they're saying that.'

The WAP rapper then explained why she hadn't told the cops that Lanez shot her even when she was taken to the hospital, saying it was because she 'didn't want to die.'  

'The police is really aggressive,' Megan claims. 'You think I'm about to tell the police that we, us black people, that we've got a gun in the car. You want me to tell them we've got a gun in the car so they can shoot all of us up.

'I'm scared. Why would I tell them there's a gun in the car and I got shot so you can get shot, he can get shot, she can get shot. I didn't immediately tell the police what happened right then because I didn't want to die.

'I didn't want the police to shoot me because there's a gun in the car.'

She said that the three others who were in the car with her -  her friend, Lanez and his security guard - were taken to jail, but she went to the hospital. 

'You want me to be a bad person so bad, y'all want to believe the lie before you believe the truth,' she added. 

'I didn't have to spare that n****, I don't have to spare nobody but I did and I'm done.'

She hit back at those that said she is lying but still did not name Lanez as she showed the stitches being taken out of her injuries. The rapper said she is 'tired' of the lies

Megan Thee Stallion posted pictures of her injuries to Instagram on Wenesday

She then accused Lanez of being scared to tell people that he shot her and so had his team spreading lies. 

'Truth is you shot me. You're scared to tell people you shot me and you got your whole team on the internet lying trying to cover your a**.

'And I'm tired of it. Stop doing that, stop dragging me.

'Stop lying on me. Stop acting like black women is the m************ problem. Stop acting like black women is aggressive when all they be doing is telling the fact.' 

TMZ had previously reported that Lanez shot Megan Thee Stallion in the foot twice after an argument on July 12 in which she and her friend attempted to get out of the SUV they were all traveling in.

The group left together from a house party in the Hollywood Hills in the early hours of the morning, but Megan and her friend Kelsey Nicole at some point wanted to leave the chauffeur-driven car. 

Video footage from the incident showed Megan leaving bloody footprints on a sidewalk after police pulled over the SUV following a report that shots were fired.
