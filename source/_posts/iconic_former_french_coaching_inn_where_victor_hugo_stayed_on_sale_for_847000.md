An iconic former French coaching inn that Victor Hugo stayed at while writing Les Misérables has gone on sale for £847,000.

The former Hotel de France has hosted a number of impressive guests, including Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, actor Gerard Depardieu and musician Midge Ure.

The property in the Nord Pas Calais area dates back to 1578 and remains structurally unchanged, with huge original coaching doors and a cobble-stoned courtyard, from the era when horse-drawn carriages were the only means of long-distance travel.

The new owner will acquire 2,500 sq ft of living space including a lounge with bar and a ballroom and stage on the ground floor, as well as a kitchen, restaurant and a second kitchen. Lounge area pictured above 

The property has 12 individually decorated bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms, as well as two apartments with two double bedrooms and en-suites

Victor Hugo stayed at the Grade I listed building, which is the oldest coaching inn in Montreuil-sur-Mer, in 1812 and took breakfast in the courtyard whilst he was writing his classic novel, which later became a hugely popular musical.

Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte stepped into the same courtyard en route to one of his many battles. Towards the end of World War I, Field Marshall Sir Douglas Haig used the hotel as his operations headquarters.

Other eminent visitors to the Hotel de France and Relais du Roy restaurant include actor Gerard Depardieu, musician Midge Ure, jockey Lester Piggott and comedian Mel Smith. He is said to have given the Hotel de France its motto: 'A place of sleep and dreams'.

Now a private home, the new owner will acquire 2,500 sq ft of living space including a lounge with bar and a ballroom and stage on the ground floor, as well as a kitchen, restaurant and a second kitchen.

Upstairs there are 12 individually decorated bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms, as well as two apartments with two double bedrooms and en-suites.

The second floor has three double bedrooms and a bathroom. There is also the courtyard, a patio, a balcony or terrace and laundry room.

The property is being sold fully furnished.

Leggett estate agent Tim Sage, who is selling the hotel, said: 'The owners have been there for over 25 years during which time they've made many changes.

'After all this time it's no surprise that they're looking to retire and have a slower pace of life after running what must be one of the world's best-known hotels.'

He said there were various plans in place for the property which a new owner could work with, including one to swap out the number of rooms to create self-catering apartments and to change the use of the restaurant to a cookery school and restaurant.
