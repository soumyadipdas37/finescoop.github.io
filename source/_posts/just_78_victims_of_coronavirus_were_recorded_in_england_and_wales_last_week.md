The number of people dying from coronavirus in England and Wales has plunged to the lowest level since mid-March, before the peak of the pandemic struck.

A total of 78 people died from Covid-19 in the week ending September 4, according to the Office for National Statistics. The dip marks a 23 per cent drop from last week, where 101 deaths have been recorded.

On the week March 7 to 13 just five deaths were recorded that mentioned coronavirus on their death statistic. The following week, the number had surged to 103.

The 25-week low is a nose-dive from the peak of the pandemic, when 8,000-plus deaths were being registered every week.

The total number of deaths in England and Wales has also fallen below the five-year average for the first time in a month, dropping 15.7 per cent below the average expected.

The number of deaths in hospitals and care homes remained below the five-year average, but the number of deaths in private homes was still above the level.

Experts had predicted the deaths may fall below the average, as Covid-19 caused more people to die earlier than they would have.

Deaths from influenza accounted for twelve times the number caused by coronavirus, at 12.8 per cent. This is a slight rise from last week where 12.6 per cent of all deaths were caused by the disease. 

Some 52,420 deaths involving Covid-19 had occurred in England and Wales up to September 4, and had been registered by September 12. 







No walk-in, drive-in or postal coronavirus tests are available for people with symptoms of the disease in England's 10 outbreak hotspots, it was claimed yesterday.

Swabs are not available in Bolton, which is fighting the largest outbreak of the virus in the country with an infection rate of 122 cases for every 100,000 people.

The Government website where testing slots are booked also shows there are no tests available in Salford, Bradford, Blackburn, Oldham, Preston, Pendle, Rochdale, Tameside and Manchester, according to LBC radio. 

When postcodes in each area are put into the testing system it allegedly comes up with the message: 'This service is currently very busy. More tests should be available later.'

The leader of the council in Bolton, which has Britain's highest infection rate, said there were 'major flaws' with the online booking system and that it was out of the council's control because the Government runs it. He said the issue was 'unacceptable'. 

There were a total of 8,996 deaths in England and Wales in the week ending September 4, which is 1,341 fewer deaths than the previous week and 1,403 deaths below the five-year average.

It is the first week that they have dropped below the average since August 13, with every region seeing fewer deaths than expected.

The South East registered the most deaths, at 1,208, followed by the North West, at 1,057, and the East of England, at 806. 

Similarly, the South East registered the most deaths from coronavirus during the week, at 17, followed by the North West, at 13, and Yorkshire and the Humber and East Midlands, which both saw 10 deaths.

The number of deaths from coronavirus in Wales increased to four deaths, from three last week, although their average number of deaths remained below the five-year average.

The overall number of deaths in Wales also dropped from 591 last week to 488. Only 0.8 per cent of these involved coronavirus. 

The ONS said that the drop may be explained by the August bank holiday weekend, contained during this week, meaning fewer officials on hand to register and process coronavirus deaths.

They wrote: 'The week ending 4 September contained the late August bank holiday, which would have contributed to the decreased number of deaths registered and the decrease in deaths registered involving Covid-19.'

Up to 4 September 424,808 deaths were registered in the UK, which stands 52,872 above the five-year average.

Of those registered, as many as 52,376 mentioned coronavirus on the death certificate, accounting for 12.3 per cent of all deaths in England and Wales.

All figures are provisional and based on death registrations, which can result in a lag between the date the person dies and when it is recorded. 

In the week up to September 4 the UK registered below 2,000 new coronavirus cases a day, reaching a peak of 1,940 on September 4.

There are concerns that the recent wave of infections, which have stayed above 2,000 new cases a day for more than a week, could result in a spike in the death rate two to four weeks later.

But the infections are mostly concentrated in young people, according to the Government, which are at a much lower risk of dying from the infection than older generations.

Despite this, however, officials have expressed concern that they could pass the virus on to older generations, which could then lead to a rise in the death rate.







It can take up to a week for coronavirus tests to be processed, meaning that the number of cases reported in the week up to September 4 actually reflect the situation in the UK a week earlier.

Paul Hunter, associate professor at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline last week he expects the death rate may also start going up 'within the next two weeks'.

An increased rate of new infections may overwhelm the UK's track and trace system, which would force authorities to re-impose some lockdown restrictions.

Increased demand for testing has already overwhelmed the UK's testing system, with no tests being available in any of the ten coronavirus hotspots in England.

Those trying to book tests are greeted with a message on the website telling them that the service is 'very busy' and that more appointments will be posted 'soon'.

The system works by allowing testing centres to upload appointments, which are then booked on a first-come-first-serve basis.

But in recent weeks there are mounting fears that those who do not need tests, and those without coronavirus symptoms, are booking them due to concerns over infection.

Matt Hancock said last week he had heard cases of whole schools trying to book tests, or those having one because they were concerned about travelling abroad, which had overwhelmed the system.

NHS trusts expressed concern this morning that their staff are unable to get tested when they display symptoms of the virus, meaning they sometimes spend weeks before they are allowed back in to work, which in turn leaves hospitals under-staffed as they try to manage a post-coronavirus backlog.
