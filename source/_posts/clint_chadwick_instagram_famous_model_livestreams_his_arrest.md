Instagram-famous model Clint Chadwick, 31, broadcast his arrest by NSW Police on social media a week ago before he was charged with allegedly choking a woman

An Instagram-famous model has been charged with choking a woman and then assaulting a policewoman while live-streaming his arrest to his 375,000 followers. 

Bodybuilder and activewear businessman Clinton Chadwick, 31, is best known for posting photographs of himself wearing little but his tattoos.

But the social media sensation recently sparked a wave of concern from his followers when he began describing himself as a vegan shaman 'psychonaut' and posting spiritual memes.

Last Wednesday, Chadwick was charged by NSW Police with allegedly assaulting, choking and intimidating a woman in the beachside suburb of Bondi. 

There were dramatic scenes when officers went to arrest him in Surry Hills, with one viewer telling Daily Mail Australia: 'He streamed the whole thing to his (Instagram) stories.'

'It went for ages, must have been like 20 stories.'

Court documents said Chadwick allegedly assaulted a female constable during the 'execution of her duty' between 9.45pm and 11pm and allegedly resisted arrest.

He was eventually taken to Waverley Police Station where he was charged with a series of domestic violence related offences against the Bondi woman, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

The footage of his arrest sparked a wave of confused and concerned comments from followers. 'Wow what the hell just happened?' one asked.

Others added Chadwick had a 'beautiful soul' and said: 'I hope he is getting help and support regardless of what he believes or says on social media'.

Chadwick runs a gym-focused activewear company, RIG FIT, with fellow Insta-sensation Hossein 'Yakiboy' Balapour one of his long-time brand ambassadors.

In an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night program in 2018, Chadwick suggested he had a troubled youth but 'it pushed me in the right direction.  

'I was bad, but I think you're a product of your environment,' he said. 

Chadwick was brought before Waverley Local Court last Wednesday afternoon.

Magistrate Ross Hudson ordered he be detained and undergo a mental health assessment at hospital.  

He is yet to enter any pleas. The case will return to court at a later date.
