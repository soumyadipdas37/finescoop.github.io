Oversized silhouettes and soft fabrics are buzz words for autumn dressing.  

Thanks to its easy, relaxed and snuggly fit, the Yidarton Women's Fluffy Fleece has become a big hit with Amazon shoppers looking for both comfort and style. 

A winning combination at an affordable price point, the fleece has been described by customers as 'loose fitting, warm and cozy' and exactly the kind of thing you reach for on a 'cold day when you want to feel snuggled up'.

Amazon shoppers are loving the oversized, slouchy fit of the Yidarton Women's Fleece, describing it as 'perfect for a cold day when you want to feel snuggled up'

Shoppers have been seriously impressed with the quality, feel and fit of the Sherpa fleece - not to mention the super affordable price point of around £20.99 (depending on what colour and size you opt for).

Described as 'beautifully soft and cosy', it's available in 10 colours from classic black and grey to autumnal shades such as green and burgundy. It also comes in leopard print and striped combinations, and is available from sizes S to XXXL.

The perfect warm cover up, it's been popular with shoppers wanting an alternative to a dressing gown when lounging around the house, as well as a warming weekend look.

'Perfect fluffy hoodie. Very happy with this hoodie!' wrote one reviewer 'I took the advice of previous reviews and ordered a few sizes up for a baggy fit.

I bought the biggest size on offer and I'm so glad I did. It's a lovely loose fit. I wanted this to wear while working from home in the colder months, but I love it so much that I'll be wearing it out and about too.'

Another added: 'Love this fleece. It's loose fitting warm and cozy and perfect for a cold day when you want to feel snuggled up.' 

The fuzzy Sherpa fleece has been described as 'snuggly' and 'beautifully soft and cosy' by shoppers and is exactly the kind of thing we want to wear this autumn 

Oversized and slouchy in fit, it is big enough to layer over outfits. Team with jeans and trainers for an effortless cool off-duty look. It's also cosy enough to replace your blanket whilst relaxing on the sofa.

A reviewer wrote: 'Best snuggly jumper ever. Absolutely love this jumper. Wanted something instead of a dressing gown. Went a size up (L) and it’s perfect, not too thick and heavy, beautifully soft and cosy, and brilliant price.' 

In addition to the soft Sherpa fabric, the jumper scores extra snug points with the 1/4 zip up collar, two side pockets to keep your hands warm and hoodie with drawstrings.
