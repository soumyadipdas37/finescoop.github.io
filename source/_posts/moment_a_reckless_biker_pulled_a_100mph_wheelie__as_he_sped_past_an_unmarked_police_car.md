This is the heart-stopping moment a careless thug sped past a police car while pulling a wheelie on the fast lane of the motorway.

Lee Embleton, 51, was filmed careering along the road at 100mph when he shot past an unmarked police car.

Officers were travelling on the A194 slip road at Follinsby Lane in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, when he and another rider overtook them.

On September 11, Embleton, of Durham, admitted dangerous driving at Newcastle Crown Court and will be sentenced on November 13. 

Police had watched in horror as the reckless driver performed a wheelie while speeding in the fast lane of the carriageway at around 1.30pm on June 23, 2018.

The video shows the police vehicle merging on to the motorway as the bike flies past them on the right with the driver balancing on his back wheel.

Another bike follows close behind as officers pull into the fast lane and hit speeds of 96mph to try and catch the two motorists.  

The officers followed Embleton and pulled him over when he slowed down in heavy traffic. 

He was slapped with an interim driving ban and an immediate forfeiture order was made for officers to seize the Yamaha bike.

Chief Inspector Sam Rennison, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We deal with dangerous driving cases on a regular basis but it beggars belief that somebody would act so stupidly and dangerously on the roads.

'The overwhelming majority of motorbike riders use the roads in a safe manner and respect their own safety as well as other motorists, but Embleton did not and must now deal with the consequences of his actions.

'Unfortunately for Embleton, he decided to carry out the ridiculous stunt right in front of an unmarked police car - and our officers were able to quickly stop him and report him for the offences.

Embleton admitted dangerous driving at Newcastle Crown Court on September 11 and will be sentenced on November 13 following his dangerous driving caught by police 

'Not only did he put his own life in danger on the afternoon in question, but also every other road user.

'His actions could easily have had fatal consequences and I sincerely hope he realises the severity of his actions.  

'Our roads are not a racetrack, and it is abundantly clear that Embleton cannot be trusted to use them in a lawful and safe manner.'
