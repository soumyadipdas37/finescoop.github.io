Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart started their week by stocking up on some groceries in Santa Monica.

The 78-year-old actor and his 55-year-old wife were spotted heading into the Vicente Food Market in Santa Monica on Monday.

The happy couple, who celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in June, kept it casual while staying safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ford kept it casual with a light grey button-down dress shirt tucked into a pair of dark blue jeans.

He was seen carrying his phone while staying safe from the COVID-19 pandemic by wearing a black face mask covering his mouth and nose.

He completed his look with a pair of black boots and a silver watch as he walked up to the market with his wife.

Ford is coming off The Call of the Wild, which hit theaters in February before theaters across the country shut down due to COVID-19.

The actor signed onto star in The Staircase back in November, his first TV series starring role in his illustrious career, according to Variety.

The series is based on a documentary series of the same name, following the trial of author Michael Peterson, who claimed his wife died after falling down a staircase, though police believed he staged it to look like an accident.

Ford has also been attached for quite some time to return as the iconic Indiana Jones in a new sequel.

James Mangold (Logan) has been set to direct the highly-anticipated sequel, with Jonathan Kasdan (Rogue One) and David Koepp (Jurassic Park) writing the script.

Paramount has already set a July 29, 2022 release date for the untitled Indiana Jones sequel, though there is no word yet when filming may begin.
