She never fails to turn heads on an outing. 

And Rita Ora ensured all eyes would be on her as she flaunted her incredible figure in a series of snaps on Monday. 

The Hot Right Now hitmaker, 29, slipped into a tiny mini dress that put her hourglass curves front and centre.

Rita dared to go braless in the low-cut garment, putting her ample cleavage on full display. 

The thigh-skimming hemline also drew attention to her tanned and toned legs, which Rita maintains with non-surgical anti-cellulite treatments. 

The blonde bombshell styled her glossy locks in Farrah Fawcett's famous feathered style and accessorised with a myriad of gold necklaces and bangles.

Rita shared the snaps on Instagram as she penned: 'The Afters and before with a big grin at the end..happy Monday everyone'.

Rita's outing comes after the secret to maintaing her svelte physique was revealed.    

The Girls singer often treats herself to a £450 anti-cellulite procedure, with celeb skincare expert Shane Cooper, which sees electromagnetic waves aimed at her pins through a laser machine, reports The Sun.

Shane, who also treats TV presenters Maya Jama and Laura Whitmore, said: 'It's the only treatment that addresses both muscle and fat with such an intense workout.'

Rita has appeared on Shane's social media pages several times, with her saying her 'skins never felt so radiant and hydrated' after one visit to the clinic.

While snaps uploaded to the skincare guru's Facebook page show Rita beaming at the camera as she relaxes while having the treatment on her legs.
