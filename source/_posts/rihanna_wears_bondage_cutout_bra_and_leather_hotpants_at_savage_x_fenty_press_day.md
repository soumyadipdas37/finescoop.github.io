Rihanna made sure all eyes were on her when she attended the Savage x Fenty press day at the Convention Center in Los Angeles on Wednesday, ahead of Friday's show. 

The singer turned underwear designer, 32, slipped into some sexy leather for the Vol. 2 presented by Amazon Prime Video.

Walking tall as she made her arrival, she proved to be the perfect brand ambassador wearing a bondage style cut-out bra underneath a leather blazer. 

Wow! Rihanna wore a cut-out bra under a leather blazer before changing into sexy hotpants and gloves at the Savage x Fenty press day at the Convention Center in LA on Wednesday

The number was cinched in at the waist with a medium width belt and she completed her look with a pair of fishnet tights. 

Stepping into a green-lit room, the Umbrella hitmaker changed hp her look for some striking leather hotpants, black gloves and an oversized statement top.   

Irina Shayk showed off her toned abs in a crop top and leather shorts and Bella Hadid also wowed in semi-sheer lace lingerie.

Actress/model Cara Delevingne, along with model/DJ Soo Joo Park were also present on the day. 

They also served up some edgy and cheeky looks on the brand's Instagram, to build further buzz leading up to the Amazon Prime Video premiere of the show.  

Meanwhile, Forbes revealed in 2019 that Rihanna — who's real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty — is the richest female musical artist.

Rihanna is now thought to be a billionaire due to her savvy business ventures.

She's got it all: As well as her singing career, Rihanna has Fenty Beauty, Savage x Fenty, Fenty and now Fenty Skin

Confidence: Rihanna looked beyond incredible as she posed for some snaps 

As well as her singing career, she has Fenty Beauty, Savage x Fenty, Fenty and now Fenty Skin. 

Pauline Rigby, head of corporate law at Forbes Solicitors, said: ‘The launch of Fenty Skin could easily push Rihanna’s personal net worth beyond billionaire status. 

In 2019, it was reported that the Diamonds singer's then $600 million net worth had eclipsed the fortunes earned by her peers Beyonce, Madonna and Celine Dion.

In addition to her latest fashion ventures, Rihanna dipped into the world of cosmetics in 2017 with Fenty Beauty, a company which accrued nearly $570million in revenue in 2018.
