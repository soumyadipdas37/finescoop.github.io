She is currently on a two-week cruise in Croatia with her husband, retired tech entrepreneur Christian Richard, 41. 

And Christine Quinn proved she was living the millionaire lifestyle as she shared a slew of bikini-clad snaps on Instagram on Thursday.

The Selling Sunset, 31, flaunted her ample cleavage and toned abs in the striking tiger print two-piece after revealing in an interview with Vogue she is all about 'plastic surgery truth-bearing'.

Christine showcased her incredible physique in the skimpy swimwear as she headed for a swim in the idyllic sea.

The blonde beauty then enjoyed an alfresco lunch, complete with oysters, with a girl pal.

It comes as Christine said she is open with the cosmetic surgery she has had and revealed it takes a team of people to get her ready to film Selling Sunset.

The blonde beauty told Vogue: 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia. 

'People think that [things are] real, and it's not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up. How I look on Selling Sunset is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.

'The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two-and-a-half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either – $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap.'

Christine went on to say in season one she wasn't doing as well financially so used to buy designer clothes and then return them after filming.

This comes just after Quinn told The Sunday Times that she has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on Selling Sunset. 

The siren said: 'People that don't know me say hurtful things. I'm just like, "Ugh, whatever." I don't know these people. 

'But when I hear stuff from other people… That's upsetting. Sometimes, it hurts my feelings. Sometimes, it makes me cry.'

Although she's as vulnerable as the next person, Christine clarified she has no intention of toning down her villainous persona.

Quinn said: 'That's what people love about me. But obviously there are different sides to me. On the show, it's one note. But I'm a multifaceted villain.'
