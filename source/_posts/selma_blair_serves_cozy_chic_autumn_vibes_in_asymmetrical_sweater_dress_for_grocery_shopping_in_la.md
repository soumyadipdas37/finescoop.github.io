Selma Blair has been enjoying plenty of quality family time at home with son Arthur Saint during quarantine.

But the Grammy nominee stepped out for an errands run solo. 

She served cozy chic autumn vibes Tuesday in an asymmetrical grey sweater dress, as she stopped for some groceries at Trader Joes in her Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles.

The 48-year-old put on a leggy display in the turtleneck number, which featured one long flowy sleeve, paired with some Birkenstock sandals.

She finished the look with some round grey tortoiseshell sunglasses, a blue-striped face mask, silver bangles and brown beaded bracelets, as she carried an off-white tote bag with brown leather straps. 

Selma recently told InStyle about how quarantine has changed her perspective on fashion: 'The pandemic has been such a shift. Of course. For myself, I look to what fashion will produce in this time. 

'How isolation, and a greater appreciation for lasting, beautiful things, has been imprinted on me. We are, naturally, mortal, and the pandemic has only solidified in me what an important salve the fashion industry has always been to my emotions. It is wardrobe. It is armor.

Dinner look: The Cruel Intentions actress served another iconic look Monday night on Instagram, as she arrived at Mauro's Cafe at Fred Segal on Melrose for dinner. She donned a roomy white Alex Mill jumpsuit with an oversized silver heart necklace, white kicks and round red sunglasses hanging from her pocket

She continued: 'It is whimsy, and grace, and fun, and a representation of the designer. I dress up in a favorite Siriano or Chanel piece at home now. Why wait? I may never leave! So, it is like I am with these people in a way. More than ever it gives us a connection. Of beauty.'

Selma wrote on Instagram: 'A fresh getup for dinner at Mauro’s. Clinging to this parking lot for dining sanity. Delicious. It’s my one big evening out every so often...the light has been golden from the fires. But clearing. 

'Also Fred Segal is an LA staple and more charming and appreciated than ever. Also! thanks @thealist.us for introducing me to my chic, light, crisp white uniform of @alexmillny playful cool space and land standard jumpsuit.'
