She welcomed her first son three years ago, when she was 50 years old.

And Janet Jackson showed off some of her son Eissa's handiwork on Saturday when she shared a photo of herself with her face painted by her three-year-old.

The 54-year-old pop icon showed off a soft smile while painted to look like a tiger in the playful snap. 

Roar! Janet Jackson, 54, looked like a tiger in a cute photo posted Saturday to Instagram after her three-year-old son Eissa painted her face

Janet's face was painted a shade of yellow, and Eissa had given her irregular black stripes for whiskers, along with a black nose.

The toddler also drew vertical stripes on her forehead to complete the tiger pattern. 

The singer wore a simple black hoodie so as not to distract from the face paint, and wore her raven tresses in box braids that were draped over her shoulders.

'My baby painted my face today, I’m a Tiger #GaveMEaBeat,' she captioned the snap while adding a cat emoji.

Baby love: Eissa was born on January 3, 2017. Janet shares him with her ex-husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana

The Nasty singer welcomed Eissa on January 3, 2017.

She shares him with her ex-husband, the Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana.

The couple began dating in 2010 after meeting earlier that year, and they married in 2012.

However, the relationship soured shortly after Eissa was born, and they announced plans for a divorce in April 2017.

Shortly after the announcement, Janet moved out of the couple's London townhouse.

Janet was then spotted back in London last year at an open mic night with her brother Jermaine, 65, who starred in the UK edition of Celebrity Big Brother back in 2007.

Although the pandemic has put plans for future tours on hold, the sister of Michael Jackson has been keeping music in her life in recent months by reposting videos from aspiring musicians on her Instagram account. 

Janet joined her family members, including her niece Paris Jackson, in wish the late King of pop a happy birthday on August 29, which came a little over 11 years after his death.
