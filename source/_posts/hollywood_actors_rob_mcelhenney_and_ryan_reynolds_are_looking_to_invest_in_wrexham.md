Wrexham, which has been fan-owned since 2011, could see a potential £2million investment from the entrepreneurial Reynolds and McElhenney.

On their club website Wrexham released a statement that read: 'As a result, talks with the proposed bidders will now continue and we are in a position to confirm the two people interested in investing in Wrexham AFC.

'Rob McElhenney is an American actor, director, producer and screenwriter, best known as the creator of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

'Ryan Reynolds is an award-winning Canadian actor, writer, producer and business entrepreneur whose credits include Marvel's Deadpool.

'In due course, Mr. McElhenney and Mr. Reynolds will put forward their vision for Wrexham AFC and proposal for members to vote on at a second Special General Meeting.'

A total of 1,223 Wrexham Supporters Trust members attended the meeting on Tuesday, where over 95% of the votes cast were in favour of holding talks with the celebrity pair as 31 voted against.

Trust director Spencer Harris explained before the meeting with the members that he wants any deal to be concluded as quickly as possible.

'All we're going to commit to - because we're not going to pressure on ourselves - is that we will conclude the discussions as soon as possible,' Harris told BBC Wales.

'We will get to a position when the potential investors put forward a deal and the next stage… we would put that in front of the members for a vote if they wish to proceed with that deal or not.'

Wrexham are the oldest football club in Wales and the third oldest football club in the world having been founded in 1864.

They fell out of the football league in 2008 and have remained a non-league club since then and became fan-owned in 2011.
