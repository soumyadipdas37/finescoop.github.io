Entertainment Tonight caught up with Midler and Najimy at last year's festivities and asked about their involvement in the upcoming Disney+ sequel.

'Oh my goodness me. Oh I hope they get to me before I'm a corpse,' Midler joked.  'We wanna fly again. I hope Disney+ is a big success and I hope we get to do it, because [Winifred] is of course one of my favorite characters.'

'Here's the honest answer: Sarah and Bette and I all have a million projects and things that we're into, so I don't know if they're gonna offer us [roles],' Najimy said at last year's event

When news began circulating about the potential reunion, Najimy was hesitant about how the women would be included. 

'Here's the honest answer: Sarah and Bette and I all have a million projects and things that we're into, so I don't know if they're gonna offer us [roles],' she said. 'I don't know if the worlds are going to collide so that we could all three do it at the same time.

'But I'm happy that it's happening, because the fans are really rabid and they really want it,' she added with a smile. '[And] if we're not all available to star in it, I think it would be so great to do a cameo. I think that'd be really fun.'
