An Australian personal trainer has shared a photo of her body 10 weeks after giving birth to her second child, and has revealed the gym routine she's following to heal her ab separation and get stronger.

Emily Skye, 35, went into labour in June at 37 weeks along, bringing her son Izaac into the world with the assistance of ambulance workers on her living room floor.

The Queensland mother and her husband Declan Redmond are already proud parents to two-year-old daughter Mia Elise.

On August 30 she updated fans on her body changes, crediting 'self love, persistence and patience' for getting back into the gym after childbirth.

'I've said this many times but it's true, the start is hard and absolutely sucks but it gets easier as you get fitter and you start feeling great before you know it,' she said (pictured left at 37 weeks and right after giving birth)

'I've said this many times but it's true, the start is hard and absolutely sucks but it gets easier as you get fitter and you start feeling great before you know it,' she said.

'I'm not naturally a motivated person. I have to create it every single day. Some days I don't have it and don't feel like working out and some days it's impossible to workout even if I want to - my babies need their mum and they are my priority.'

If she can find time for herself she's sticking to her training regime where she can and eating food that's 'good for her'.  

'I'm feeling great and while my progress seems slow at times, I'm getting there and have already come a long way since the start of my postpartum fitness journey,' she said.

* She is mostly using her home gym in the garage to reduce her ab separation.

* Pilates bridging and light core exercises are helping with the condition.

* On days she has time for a more intense workout Emily is doing kettlebell swings, lunges, squats and deltoid work to strengthen her back.

* The personal trainer has complained of a sore back from carrying around Izaac so she is trying to ease the pain by making her back stronger.

* Emily is engaging her pelvic floor muscles during every movement. 

Whether she is squatting, lunging or using the rower machine, Emily is focused on maintaining a connection with her pelvic floor and abdominals. 

She experienced ab separation after giving birth and wants to 'draw' her abdominals back together.

The condition is a gap in between your right and left abdominal wall muscles that can result in a rounded, protruding belly.

It is best treated soon after birth with physiotherapy, and in rarer cases, cosmetic surgery. 

She will alternatively walk on the treadmill with baby Izaac strapped to her front or work out in the family's home gym.

'Sometimes I want to go really hard but I can't, I'm holding myself back. I'm listening to my body and taking it really easy,' she said.

Emily's enjoying kettlebell swings, Pilates bridging and core rotation exercises at present, but isn't doing anything without engaging her midsection first. 

Her son Izaac arrived quickly and three weeks early, not giving Emily and Declan enough time to drive to the hospital.

'Well THAT was unexpected! Little Izaac just couldn't wait any longer to enter the world,⁣⁣' Emily said on June 18.

'I'll share with you our birth story soon! Be ready, it's a wild one.' 

Emily accompanied her birth announcement with photos of the delivery, which involved a lot of towels and a frazzled looking husband.   

She looked understandably exhausted as she lay on the floor with little Izaac resting on her lap underneath a blanket.
