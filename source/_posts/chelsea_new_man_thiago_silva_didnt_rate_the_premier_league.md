Chelsea new boy Thiago Silva has revealed he previously had no interest in joining the Premier League because he considered English football to be about long balls and long-range shots.

The 36-year-old left Paris Saint-Germain for Stamford Bridge this summer and is likely to make his debut against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.

‘I had never seen myself in the Premier League previously,’ admitted Silva. ‘My impression of the football was of long balls, high balls and long shots. I thought at the time that I couldn’t see myself playing in that.

The Brazilian defender has won 30 trophies during his career in France, Brazil, and Italy

‘But over time I have seen that it has developed tremendously, there’s a lot more technical quality. Little by little, the Premier League won me over.’

The Brazil defender has won 30 trophies during a stellar career and will add experience to a backline that has faltered throughout Frank Lampard’s tenure.

Silva is keen to pick up phrases that will allow him to make an immediate impact. ‘It’s going to be difficult, it always is with a new language,’ said Silva, who already speaks Italian, French, Spanish and his native Portuguese.

‘I’m studying Monday to Friday to speak English, looking at the basic terms and words — tracking back, changing sides. You prioritise the important words.’ 

Now he's at Chelsea, and is trying to learn English to improve his game under Frank Lampard

Wednesday’s game will come too early for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, who yesterday had a medical ahead of his £22million move from Rennes.

l West Bromwich manager Slaven Bilic has been charged with improper conduct by the FA. The Croatian boss came on to the pitch at half-time in his side’s defeat by Everton on Saturday and was shown a red card by referee Mike Dean for his protests.

The FA has now decided to charge him over the incident. Bilic said: ‘As a manager, I should be in a situation to ask the referee what’s going on.’
