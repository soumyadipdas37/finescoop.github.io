Kaley Cuoco took one of her beloved dogs on a walk in a stroller whilst out in New York City this weekend.

The 34-year-old sitcom blonde was joined by her younger brunette sister Briana during her outing in the Big Apple.

She recently crossed the country from her home on the west coast to complete filming on her upcoming HBO Max show The Flight Attendant.

Kaley pulled on a grey hoodie and a matching baseball cap, slipping into a pair of black leggings and white sneakers.

A day earlier she swung by her Insta Stories to celebrate that her HBO Max animated show Harley Quinn has been renewed for a third season.

'TOLD YA!!!!!! @DCHARLEYQUINN SEASON 3 COMIN A YOU!!!!!! @HBOMAX,' she captioned over a snap of her cartoon avatar.

She foreshadowed the post by writing on Insta Stories: 'I never do this but I'm announcing exciting news in a few hours...!' though she had to make sure to add: 'And no, I'm not pregnant so stop asking.'

Her latest outing comes three days after her equestrian second husband Karl Cook was able to travel out from Los Angeles and join her in New York.

She uploaded a romantic Instagram snap of them kissing passionately in the city and gushed in the caption: 'Finally!!' 

Season one of The Flight Attendant has eight episodes, and filming on the sixth was underway when the shoot was suspended for lockdown in March. 

One of the showrunners Steve Yockey appeared in a virtual panel for the Television Critics Association press tour in early August and hinted production was to restart.

He dished that 'assuming everything goes according to plan, you'll see it on HBO Max this fall,' according to The Hollywood Reporter. 

While in Los Angeles this April, Kaley and her dashing husband finally moved in together more than a year after their wedding.

Kaley told Access this March that she and Karl were planning to move into their luxurious Los Angeles home the following month.

They were waiting until renovation was completed on their Hidden Hills estate, which they jointly bought for $11.75 million according to Variety.

Their plan was to move into the property after she finished shooting The Flight Attendant in New York, but lockdown threw a wrench in that idea.

Although the actress and the equestrian married on a horse ranch over the summer of 2018 they had never lived together before this year.
