X Factor narrator Peter Dickson, who also 'upset' entertainment manager Simon by taking part in the show, allegedly shared the claims in his new book Voiceover Man.

The comedian reportedly told the voiceover artist, 63: 'He hated it. Hated everything about it. Thought we were taking the p***, undermining his success. He sent me a really stinking email.

'He was particularly upset about your involvement and I felt a bit guilty about that as I had given you my word, when we met, that it was an affectionate parody.'

According to The Sun, Peter is believed to have commented on Simon's change of mind after the two-part series attracted over 11 million viewers.

He transformed into aspiring singer Geraldine McQueen, whose track The Winner's Song reached number 2 in the UK singles chart.

The music executive was rushed to hospital at the beginning of August when he fell from his electric bike whilst taking it for a test drive at his house in Malibu. 

But despite his excruciating injury, it appears that the Britain's Got Talent judge is well on the mend as his former girlfriend and close friend Sinitta, 51, gave an update on his recovery.

Speaking to Entertainment Daily, the singer said: 'It was a serious accident. So for people who love him, like me, it was very, very scary.

'He's taken some steps, so he has reassured himself that he's not paralysed. But he's got to take his time and get well.'

Since injuring his back, the media personality has had to pull out of his shows Britain's Got Talent and America's Got Talent, as he took some time out of the spotlight to recover. 

Simon had been hoping to be well enough to film the BGT Christmas Special, but it's recently been revealed that he'd been forced to pull out. 

Sources claim the TV star is unable to travel to the UK from his home in Los Angeles to film the festive episode in October.
