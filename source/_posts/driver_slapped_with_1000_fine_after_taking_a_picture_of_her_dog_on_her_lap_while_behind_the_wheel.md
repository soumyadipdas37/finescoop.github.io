A driver has been slapped with a $1,000 fine after being busted taking a picture of their dog while behind the wheel. 

The pooch was perched on the driver's lap as they travelled through Peppermint Grove in Perth's west last week.

The culprit was fined for 'aggravated use of a mobile phone whilst driving' and shamed by Wembley Police online.  

Wembley Police publicly shamed the driver in a social media post on Thursday, stating 'this is what happens when (you) take photos of your dog who is on your lap whilst driving'

'This is what happens when (you) take photos of your dog who is on your lap whilst driving,' Western Australia Police posted on Facebook on Thursday.

The post has garnered hundreds of comments online, with some slamming the driver's behaviour. 

'Should have been fined double for endangering the dog as well,' one Facebook user wrote. 

'Hope they learnt their lesson! Could have caused an accident and killed someone,' another wrote.  

Others were bemused by the nature of the fine. 

'Trying to picture "aggravated use of a mobile phone". Was she angrily snapping the photos?' one said.  

'"Aggravated use"?? Was he bashing the dog with it?' another noted. 

'How do you use your phone in an aggravated way?' a third asked. 

The driver lost four demerit points on top of the $1,000 fine.
