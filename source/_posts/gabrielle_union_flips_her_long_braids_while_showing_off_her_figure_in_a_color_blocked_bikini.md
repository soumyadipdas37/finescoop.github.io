Her triangle top was tied in the center of her chest with a knot detail, the same tie was featured on both sides of her bottoms. 

The Being Mary Jane actress flipped her long braided hairstyle in the air as she posed along a railing with a scenic mountain range behind her. 

In a closeup selfie she showed off her fresh skin and Jacquemus bucket hat.

She added a simple accessory of a thin gold chain necklace to her look for an elegant touch. 

Also on Tuesday, Gabrielle shared a series of photos with her former NBA All-Star husband. 

They posed together with mountains, an ocean and rainbow behind them as they stood on a think walkway between a pool.
