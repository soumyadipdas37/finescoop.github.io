Bethenny Frankel recently started a vegetarian diet with her daughter Bryn.

And whatever the Real Housewives of New York City alum is doing appears to be doing the trick.

She showed off her toned figure Tuesday in a colorful geometric one-piece swimsuit, as she caught a wave during a surf class in the Hamptons, where she's been enjoying her quarantine.

The 49-year-old accessorized the swimwear with a diamond pendant necklace and a pair of gold bracelets.

She covered up with a matching tropical floral rash guard, as she impressively shredded a wave on a longboard.

Frankel later took to Instagram in another sexy swimwear look, sporting a red zip-up one piece, trimmed in triangular cutouts.

She paired it with a matching red sun hat and chunky black sunglasses, while sitting on the edge of a boat.

The Skinnygirl founder revealed last week on her Instagram Story that she was trying vegetarianism at the request of daughter Bryn Hoppy, 10. 

She said: 'Bryn wants to be a vegetarian cause she loves animals, so she’s asked me to do it with her. I used to eat this way, so let’s see how it goes.' 

Frankel welcomed Bryn with estranged husband Jason Hoppy, 49, with whom she filed for divorce in 2013.

She may be getting ready to become a mother again, recently opening up about her desire to adopt in the comments of an Instagram post about a boy in foster care.

The BStrong activist commented: 'I will adopt him. Bryn said “momma you should adopt him.”

Frankel also revealed: 'The thing that surprises people is that once they get into the system, it is hard to get them out. Growing up, we always heard that everyone wants a baby and not an older kid. 

'I tried a while back to adopt a 3-year-old and it was a harder process than a newborn. If it’s like other family law systems, it’s not as easy as the movies make it.'
