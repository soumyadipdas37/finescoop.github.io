Word Gigi and Zayn were expecting first emerged in April after a 'family source' spilled the beans about the IMG beauty and her on/off boyfriend of five years. 

Shortly after she confirmed the news herself. 

Gigi said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. 

'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.' 

Gigi seemed to hint that her child was on the way at the end of August when she shared a stunning photo of herself at 33-weeks.

At the time it was unclear whether she was counting down from the time of the post or the photoshoot.

But he later clarified that the family was still waiting when asked if Gigi had in fact given birth in the comment section.

When a fan wondered 'Did Gigi give birth to her baby, please can anyone answer,' he said 'No, not yet.'

'[They are] closer than ever. Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn,' the source revealed. 'She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.'

The couple spent much of her pregnancy at her mother Yolanda farm in Pennsylvania, where her family isolated during the pandemic. 

The baby girl seems to be just the start for the young family.

Back in May People said the celebrity couple 'plan to have a large family.'
