Lottie Moss cut a low-key figure as she stepped out with a friend in Notting Hill on Wednesday.

The model, 22, wore an oversized tie-dye purple hoodie with turquoise sleeves and black skinny jeans.

Adding some finishing touches, Lottie opted for chunky Prada-inspired knee-high boots and a small clutch bag.

The model took cautious measures amid the coronavirus pandemic and wore a pink face mask for her outing.

Lottie left her blonde locks relaxed and tucked into her hoodie, she appeared to go makeup-free.

The younger sister of supermodel Kate Moss appeared to be enjoying a shopping trip with her friend and she carried a Diptyque bag.

Meanwhile, in the romance department, Lottie was seen putting on a cosy display with a mystery hunk earlier this month, following a lavish meal with friends in London.

The 22-year-old model and her companion arrived at Kensington's Nam Long Le Shaker restaurant and bar shortly before midnight and were seen hugging amid their multiple cigarette breaks outside the popular venue. 

Elsewhere, Lottie fuelled dating speculation as she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during a recent holiday.

In videos and pictures shared to Instagram, Chris, 27, can be seen putting on a cosy display with the blonde, and even proceeds to drape his leg over her.

Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April. 

It came after Lottie was linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury. 

A mutual friend told The Sun on Sunday: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.

'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'   

MailOnline contacted representatives for Lottie and Roman for comment at the time of publication.
