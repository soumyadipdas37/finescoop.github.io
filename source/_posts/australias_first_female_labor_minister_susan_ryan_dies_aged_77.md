Labor luminary and pioneering feminist Susan Ryan has died age 77, with tributes flowing from both sides of politics.

Ms Ryan served in the Hawke government and was responsible for landmark sex discrimination and affirmative action laws.

The Sydney-born women's rights trailblazer was the first female Labor government minister.

She was elected to one of two newly created ACT senate seats in 1975 and campaigned on the slogan: 'A woman's place is in the Senate.'

Ms Ryan was elevated to the frontbench after Gough Whitlam-led Labor lost the 1977 election, and in 1979 the women's affairs portfolio was added to her responsibilities.

She introduced a private member's bill to ban discriminatory acts based on gender or marital status in 1981 and then rose to be education minister and women's minister when Bob Hawke came to power in 1983.

Her bill passed later that year, leading to the creation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.

She stayed in parliament for 12 years before quitting suddenly in 1987 after being demoted.

Ms Ryan worked in several academic and industry roles and was briefly chair of Australia's republican movement after the failed 1999 referendum.

She returned to fighting for rights in the past decade, with appointments as Australia's inaugural age discrimination commissioner and later disability discrimination commissioner.

Australia's first female prime minister Julia Gillard led online tributes, saying the nation had lost a 'feminist hero and Labor giant'.

'Every Australian's life has been improved by her leadership on gender equality,' she tweeted.

'She blazed the trail for Labor women, including me. I honour a woman of courage and true believer.'

NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay echoed those words: 'Her legacy lives in every Labor woman who seeks to make a difference.'

Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese said her accomplishments went beyond a series of 'historic firsts'.

'In a life dedicated to women's rights and equality, Susan achieved something even bigger - that while she was the first, she would never be the last,' he tweeted.

His predecessor Bill Shorten suggested Ms Ryan was a 'worthy candidate' for a state funeral.

Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull remembered the Labor legend as a 'champion for justice all her life'.
