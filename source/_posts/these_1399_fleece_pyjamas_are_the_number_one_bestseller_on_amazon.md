There's nothing that brings us more joy in the colder months then settling down with a good book or great TV series in a new pair of cosy pyjamas.  

If you've yet to find your perfect pair, then it might be worth heading over to Amazon where hundreds of shoppers have fallen for the cosy charms of the CityComfort Pyjama Set.

Costing only £13.99 for an ultra-soft two-piece set, the CityComfort Pyjamas are a big hit with consumers, even becoming the number one bestseller in the 'Women's Pyjama Sets' category.  

The CityComfort Pyjama Set is currently the number one bestseller in 'Women's Pyjama Sets' on Amazon, accumulating hundreds of glowing reviews 

Hundreds of Amazon shoppers have left glowing reviews for the bestselling pyjamas, calling them an 'excellent item, so comfy and warm and ideal for lounging' and 'so soft and snuggly'.

With winter on the horizon there's no doubt these pyjamas will continue to be an incredibly popular buy. Made with super soft fleece material it's literally like wearing your favourite blanket, and unlike a dressing gown you won't have to take them off before you go to sleep. 

One customer wrote: 'Absolutely gorgeous quality. So soft, true to size and so snuggly on these cold nights.'

Another added: 'Extremely soft and snuggly. Some of best pyjamas I've bought.'

A third raved: 'Snuggly comfortable pyjamas. Lovely, comfortable and fluffy... perfect for those cold winter nights looming.'

The cosy CityComfort pyjama set is available in five colours and in sizes from S to XL

The cosy pyjama set is available in five colours ranging from neutral soft grey to blue and pink. 

Sizes range from S to XL, and shoppers have mentioned that they come up a little large, so it's best to stick to your usual size if you like relaxed-fitting loungewear.

Shoppers have even come back for more, with one returning customer writing: 'Love these, very comfortable and cosy. This my second purchase and may possibly not be my last!'  

Another agreed, adding: 'Wow what great pyjamas, very comfortable, very warm and don't shrink in the wash. Only problem was not enough different colours to buy or I would buy more, I spend a lot of hours in these.'
