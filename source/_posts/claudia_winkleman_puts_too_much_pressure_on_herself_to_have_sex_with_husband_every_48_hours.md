Claudia Winkleman has revealed she puts 'too much pressure on herself' to have sex every 48 hours with her husband of 20 years. 

The Strictly host, 48, made the confession as she talked about how social media heightened her anxieties because she would see couples professing their love to one another online. 

Claudia married husband film producer Kris Thykier, 48, back in June 2000.

She told The Sun at her book launch, Quite: 'I think we put way too much pressure on ourselves.

'I haven't had sex with my husband for two days let's do it on the stairs.'

Claudia added she thinks things will spice up in the bedroom department when her eldest son Jake flies the nest.

She added: 'He's 17 and keeps talking about it. He's super excited. I’m sure it will be great. Me and husband will learn how to make stew and we’ll read lots of books and we’ll do tickling – that’s code in case anyone is wondering.' 

Claudia and Kris have been married for 20 years after being introduced by friends. As well as their son Jake they have Matilda, 14, and Arthur, nine.  

Earlier this summer, Claudia confessed she does not take her Strictly Come Dancing position for granted as she admitted she fears for her job.

 In an interview with Daily Star Sunday, the host - who reportedly earns £450,000 a year - explained: 'If they'll have me, I'll keep doing it. But I assume I'll be fired any minute'. 

Claudia surprisingly revealed she has never tuned in to watch herself, insisting: 'I can't or I'd be sick, I can't imagine how irritating I am'.   

The brunette beauty has worked on television for over 30 years but Claudia has put a great deal of her success down to 'luck'. 

She said: 'I feel I have already had too long a run. I am incredibly lucky'.

Strictly Come Dancing will be back on screens on the BBC this autumn and will be presented by Claudia and Tess Daly.
