Multiple people including the suspect have died after police opened fire during a hostage standoff in broad daylight in Salem, Oregon, on Monday.

Police arrived at the house in Juneva Place SE at 12.30pm after reports of the potentially dangerous situation.

After deputies from the Marion County Sheriff's Office arrived, a negotiator started talking with the suspect inside.
