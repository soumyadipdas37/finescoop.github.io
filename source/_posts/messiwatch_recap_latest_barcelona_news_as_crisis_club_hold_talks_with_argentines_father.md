Lionel Messi and Barcelona are set for a huge week that will define the future for both clubs, and the legacy the Argentine leaves behind at the Nou Camp. 

The 33-year-old has informed the Spanish club of his desire to leave this summer, telling them by burofax that he expects to be able to leave for free.

Club President Josep Bartomeu has made it clear the club are prepared to fight tooth and nail for the player. 

It has culminated in head-to-head talks taking place, with Messi's father Jorge flying in from Argentina to Spain for a sit down with the club. He was pictured landing in Barcelona on Wednesday morning. 

You can relive all the developments as they happened below.

Well, with still no news about the meeting between Messi Snr and Bartomeu, it looks like the drama will drag on until tomorrow. Even without any dialogue between the pair, Jorge managed to shed further light on the situation by admitting it would be 'difficult' for his son to stay at the club and denied speaking to Pep Guardiola.

Hopefully we should have a better idea of his discussions with the club in the coming days.

Thanks for joining Sportsmail today. Until next time.     

According to Spanish football expert Guillem Balague, Jorge Messi is hoping to clinch an agreement with Barcelona over his son's exit - even though he is confident his team would win any legal case. 

He claims that Barcelona plan to report Messi and the club he signs for if they fail to pay his £630m release clause - although they acknowledge that talks with Jorge should end with an agreement for his exit.

Balague adds that Manchester City have no plans to offer a transfer fee.

#FCB leaking they won't sell and will report Messi and the club he might sign for if they do not pay €700mJorge wants his son to leave for free#MCFC leaks they will not be involved if transfer fee plus wages have to be paidBut some of that I don't believe...

Jorge Messi and Josep Bartomeu will have a number of issues to sort out when they eventually meet, but even if the club do allow the Argentine to leave, it will require some serious financial might from Man City to get the deal done. 

Messi is on wages of up to £95m a year and Etihad officials could be forced to splash out £630m for his release clause. But with the club under the microscope following their Financial Fair Play saga, do they really have the power to pull off this signing?

Sportsmail's Daniel Matthew looks at all the key issues facing City in their pursuit to land one of the greatest players ever.

It seems there is such a desire to find out everything about this meeting that Sky Sports have even revealed exactly what Jorge Messi had for lunch at La Focaccia Dante Gori.

Jorge Messi has left the restaurant, followed by a hoard of photographers, and is now meeting with Bartomeu 'imminently'. 

According to the TV channel, he has spent the whole morning talking with his lawyers. 

As El Chringuito TV states: 'The time is coming. Jorge Messi leaves the restaurant after having spent the whole morning meeting with his lawyers. Imminent meeting with Bartomeu.

Jorge may not have met with Bartomeu quite yet, but he has managed to sneak in a spot of lunch with Lionel's brother, Rodrigo. 

Mundo Deportive report: 'Jorge was in his offices until he went to an Italian restaurant at 1:55pm, this time, hidden from the journalists in a car that came directly from the parking lot. His son Rodrigo , Leo's right hand man in Barcelona, accompanied him for lunch.

Not quite the meeting we were all promised...

You get the distinct impression that nobody really knows what is going on at the moment. 

According to Spanish journalist Adrian Sanchez on Twitter: 'RAC1 confirms that the meeting will be this afternoon. We will see.'

RAC1 are one of the biggest radio stations in Cataluyna.

RAC1 confirma que la reunión será esta tarde. Veremos.

That's according to ESPN, who say that the meeting will now take place tomorrow (Thursday) morning.

That's if aspiring Barcelona president Victor Font has his way. If Font dislodges the unpopular Bartomeu in next year's elections, he'll inherit what is increasingly likely to be a Messi-less Barcelona.But he has a plan to help the club's ultimate legend return to the Nou Camp.

Like most clubs, Barcelona will have planned the adverts for their new home kit long ago. And perhaps unsurprisingly, when all was a little rosier at the Nou Camp, they decided to put Messi front and centre of the main images of the squad in the new home kit.Fast forward a couple of months and now, Barcelona supporters have found the pictures to be salt in the wounds. 'Messi doesn't come with the kit anymore,' read one Tweet, which sums up the feeling of many.

Waiting to see how it all pans out today, are Manchester City.

They are undoubtedly the frontrunners when it comes to providing the Argentine with a new home. 

However, the news that Messi should be seeking a reunion with Pep Guardiola has come as something of a surprise for some. 

As reported by The Athletic, one source said: 'I always had the feeling he wanted an experience abroad.

'Even more of a surprise than City is that he would go back to working with Pep. The relationship after so many intense seasons at Barcelona with Guardiola was not the best with the players.'

According to The Athletic, Messi's father is now waiting in the family's office, which is located just 10 minutes from the Nou Camp.

Here's the full story of his morning, so far on a big day for him, and his son. 

 

There are a few candidates lininh up to replace Josep Bartomeu come next March, and one has been giving his two pence on the situation.

Businessman Victor Font has described Manchester City as 'top candidates' themselves, insisting they are the best fit for Lionel Messi, but his main desire is to see things smoothed out between Messi and Barca. 

'I’m truly hoping reason prevails and as soon as the club and Messi’s father sit down and talk, that the interest of both Messi and Barca will be taken into account and properly protected,' he told talkSPORT. 

'Hope is the last thing you lose, so that’s why until he’s gone we will continue hoping that the situation can change.

'But beyond that, what I believe is very important is that a reasonable agreement is reached, so that we protect the interests of the club going forward.'

While everything is going on behind the scenes, there is actually a press conference bing held for one outgoing star at the Nou Camp.

Ivan Rakitic is speaking to journalists after completing his move to Sevilla, and he's had his say and what he thinks is best for Messi and the club. 

'The first option and the best option for all the players is always Barça,' he told reporters.

'Then each player has to make their decision and I prefer to talk about mine, the others I don't know but for me it is The first option would always have to be Barça.'

The showdown between Bartomeu and Messi Snr is closer than we thought, according to PETE JENSON. 

The meeting now likely to happen before, not after lunch, as was originally expected.

Messi's father has broken his silence after being approached by a journalist getting out of his taxi. 

He told the report it would be 'difficult' for his son to continue on at Barcelona.

In the mind of Lionel Messi, he hasn't been a Barcelona player for over a week now. 

That is the view of Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. 

Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: 'Right now, I can tell you what his side are saying.

'He has stopped being a Barcelona player from August 25 when he sent the recorded delivery letter saying "I’m gone".

'So, from this point of view in his mind he’s not a Barcelona player anymore.'

Footage of Messi Snr touching down in Barcelona has emerged.

He has been pencilled in to meet with President Bartomeu later on today. 

Lionel Messi's father and agent has touched down in Spain for crunch talks with the Barcelona hierarchy over his son's future.

The player might want away, but the club are determined to show fans he is here to stay. On the Twitter post announcing the availability of their new kit this morning, Messi is front and centre.

There is quite a lot to get your head around when it comes to this story. Thankfully for you lot, our man PETE JENSON has you covered. 

Jorge Messi has arrived in Barcelona for a meeting with Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu that looks set to be one of the most important in the club's history.

Do they get to keep club legend Lionel Messi for maybe three more years, enjoying all the landmark matches that would come in his final seasons? Or do they lose him in an undignified jumble of missed training sessions, leaked conversations, disputed contract clauses, and with the 8-2 defeat to Bayern his last ever game? And is there even an ugly court case thrown in at the end for good measure?

Before Barcelona president Bartomeu meets with Jorge Messi, believed to be on Wednesday, he will need to find unity in the boardroom.

On touching down in Barcelona, Messi Snr has broken his silence on the subject, though not that he had much to add to the situation. 

Speaking to reporters, Jorge said: 'I don't know anything, guys,' before adding that he had not spoken to Pep Guardiola himself.

Waiting in the wings patiently, to see how this all plays out, are Manchester City. 

Pep Guardiola and Co are the only ones realistically capable of offering Messi the project he desires - another shot at the Champions League. 

His relationship with his former mentor holds the key to the deal, with it reported last week that Messi had called Guardiola upon making his decision to quit the Nou Camp. 

City cannot afford the player at any cost, however, and should there be the slightest indication that they may be liable to pay his release clause of around £623m, then they may have to step away from the table. 

Despite this, Messi has every intention of fighting this all the way, and has made it clear he is willing to let a long court process be drawn out before he even considers returning to training. 

For Josep Bartomeu, it is imperative to keep Messi in the blue and red of Barcelona. No president wants to be remembered as the one who lost Lionel Messi.

He has a couple of ideas to throw Messi and Co off their game, most notably by insisting that his current situation bears no resemblance to that experienced by Xavi, Iniesta or indeed Puyol. 

Bartomeu's own time at the club is up shortly, and come March he will no longer be president. He may hope a reminder of this could sway the Argentine to hang on a little longer. 

But the truth is, according to the thoughts of some other board members, losing Messi may not be the worst-case scenario. Receiving a fee and getting his wages off the books following the catastrophic effects of the coronavirus pandemic could actually be a healthy move for the club.

At this stage, though, Bartomeu may be more interested in how this saga's outcome affects his own legacy, not just the club's. 

As far as Messi is concerned, according to those close to him, there is no going back. 

Jorge Messi is in Barcelona for one reason, and one reason alone; to convince the club to let his son go. 

Lionel has refused to return to training and in his eyes he is no longer under contract at the Nou Camp. 

His camp will go into talks armed with a number of points, most notably the treatment of other club legends. 

Xavi, Iniesta and Puyol were all granted the opportunity to leave the club on their own terms. 

Not only that, but Bartomeu himself stated last year that Messi could leave this summer. 'Messi has a contract that we signed two years ago for four years,' he has previously stated.

'In the last year of the contract, before the 2020-21 season starts, he can leave the club. He can quit football or go to another team.'

Bartomeu, though, will be sure to argue that this has been taken out of context... 

Jorge Messi has flown in from Argentina especially for talks today. 

He arrived at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat airport and will sit down with Joesp Bartomeu, the club president, later on today.

He insists the only reason he will use the meeting for, is to attempt to persuade Messi's camp that signing a new contract is the only way forward. 

But you get the distinct impression Messi Snr has not flown 6,500 miles to thrash out new terms. 

Here we are folks, at the day many thought we would never see. 

Lionel Messi, after a 19-year association with the club, is finally prepared to walk away from Barcelona.

His father is in town to do the talking, with his son adamant that he is well within his rights to excercise a break clause in his contract that will see him leave for free.

The club, as to be expected, are prepared to fight tooth and nail to keep hold of the world's best player. 

Will they finally lose their grip on him today?
