Kate Ferdinand posted a photo with her family on Tuesday - but kept the limelight to just her on Wednesday with a solo pregnancy snap.

The WAG, 29, posed in a floor-length light green silk dress which clinched her baby bump.

The shoulderless number featured spaghetti straps and showed off her tanned limbs.

She added to the glam with white strapped heels, a baby blue clutch and gold accessories.

She wore her honey-blonde locks in waves around her features and held her bump proudly.

She captioned the snap: 'Favourite photo spot... don’t be fooled by this pik, by the end of the night the feet were swollen, the heels were off and the bed was calling [sic].'

The day before, she looked radiant as she posed with her husband Rio, 41, who she is expecting her first child with, and his three children.

The former TOWIE star was every inch the glowing mum-to-be in a fitted bright yellow midi dress as two of her step-children cradled the blossoming bump.

The latest trip comes after Kate and Rio Ferdinand reportedly splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.

The celebrity couple are said to want extra security at their mansion for their growing family.

They reportedly enlisted the help of a special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, to buy the pair of black German shepherds.

A source told The Sun: 'One is already at their home, and the second will be joining shortly. 

Happy news: It's Kate's first child with husband Rio but she is stepmother to his children Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia

'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!

'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'

It comes after a number of high-profile burglaries at footballers' homes, with Dele Alli and Fabinho among those targeted recently.

Chaperone K9 shared a snap of the new protection dogs on their Instagram, tagging Kate and Rio in the post before they edited it.

They also previously posted a photo of Rio posing with one of the dogs's alongside Kate's chihuahua
