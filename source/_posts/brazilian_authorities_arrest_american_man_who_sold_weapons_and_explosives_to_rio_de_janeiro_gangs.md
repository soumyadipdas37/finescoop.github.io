Anthony David Schethtman was arrested by officers from the robbery and theft division unit on Tuesday night, according to Civil Police.

Schethtman, who reportedly holds American, British and Israeli citizenship, was  being investigated for selling weapons and explosives which were used in bank robberies carried out by criminal groups in Rio de Janeiro, cops said.

The Civil Police said Schethtman, who was known as 'El Gringo', was driving a stolen vehicle when he was stopped in downtown Rio by cops assigned to the investigation.
