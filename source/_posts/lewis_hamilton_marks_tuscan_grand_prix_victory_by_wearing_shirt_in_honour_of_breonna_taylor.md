Lewis Hamilton strolled to success at the Tuscan Grand Prix but he remains keen to fight battles off the track as well as on it.

Hamilton battled back from early adversity where he lost the lead at the start of the race in Mugello to eventually see off his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas and claim his 90th Formula One win.

But Hamilton was keen to promote matters away from the race track as he took the plaudits on top of the podium, wearing a shirt that read 'Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor' on the front, with the reverse reading 'say her name'.

Hamilton had earlier worn the shirt in the build up to the Tuscan Grand Prix in Italy

Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American, was fatally shot by American police back in March following an incident at her home.

Hamilton has been fighting for racial equality and justice throughout the season, supporting a 'Black Lives Matter' logo on his crash helmet.

Having also worn the shirt on the grid prior to the race Hamilton paid tribute to the emergency medical technician in his post-race interview.

The world champion took victory around Mugello, marking his 90th in Formula One

There he admitted his race was tough following a chaotic GP at Mugello that saw three race starts following two red flag incidents following major crashes. 

'It was like three races in one day,' he said after the race. 'Just incredibly tough. we had a difficult start.

'The heat and keeping Valtteri behind, who has been quick all weekend, was not easy. I was behind at the beginning. Total focus was needed for the restarts. It was really, really hard.

Hamilton is now just one win shy of Michael Schumacher's all-time record in the sport

'Keeping that over one-second gap was crucial as I didn't want them [race rivals] to have DRS on that 1000m straight. Justice for Breonna Taylor.'

Hamilton now heads to Russia in two weeks time looking to equal Michael Schumacher's Formula One record of 91 victories.

Should the world champion taste success again in Sochi, he could then break the German's record at the following race in his homeland at the German Grand Prix held at the Nurburgring.
