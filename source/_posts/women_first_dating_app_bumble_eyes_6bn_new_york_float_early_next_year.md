Dating app Bumble is looking at listing on the New York Stock Exchange early next year

A dating app that lets women make the first move is planning to go public in a float worth up to £6billion.

Bumble is looking at listing on the New York Stock Exchange early next year, according to reports. 

It would be the latest in a string of technology floats over the last couple of years – which have included Uber, Lyft and Pinterest.

Bumble allows users to set up a profile and see the profiles of other singletons nearby.

Users can swipe left if they aren’t interested in someone, and right if they are. 

But what makes Bumble different is that once two people swipe right and match with one another, women have to initiate the conversation.

Founded in 2014 by Whitney Wolfe Herd, who previously co-founded the first mainstream dating app Tinder, it was set up like this to give women more control after some reported feeling harassed on other dating apps.
